So tough that the number of debut issuers is down by almost half this quarter compared with the last one.\n\nAnd that\u2019s while sales in the broader market are holding up amid China\u2019s economic slowdown and the trade war. The issue: buyers are putting more scrutiny on borrowers now, thanks to a record pace of defaults.\n\n\u201cIssuers will have to do more to convince investors than before,\u201d said Roy Kwok, a partner and senior portfolio manager at DeepBlue Global Investment in Hong Kong. First-time borrowers are usually second or third-tier companies in their sector, adding to credit-profile concerns, he said.\n\nBuyers in the secondary market, too, are pressing for more, with yields on junk-rated Asian dollar bonds climbing since June.\n\nMuch of the Asian junk market is accounted for by developers from China. Chinese borrowers make up about 60% of issuance in dollar debt from Asia excluding Japan, which has raced to $244 billion so far this year, compared with just $61 billion back in 2009.\n\nFirst-time issuers were a big source of that growth in sales. But now investors including DeepBlue, Pictet Wealth Management and Matthews Asia say they\u2019re either avoiding those deals or asking for bigger pricing concessions.\n\nThat helps explain why there have been only 13 debut sellers so far this quarter, against 22 in April-to-June.\n\nInvestors are weighing the relatively poor performance of Chinese new issues and high-yield notes over the past two months, according to Thomas Wu, head of Asia fixed income at Pictet Wealth Management. \u201cDebut names would need a meaningful first-time issuance premium,\u201d he said.\n\nSome 8% of Chinese debut issuers since 2016 have seen their ratings cut after selling their securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s double the rate in the rest of Asia.\n\nHigh-yield bonds in August handed investors their first loss this year, reinforcing the preference for safer credits. And there\u2019s been a strong bias toward investment-grade sales as issuance rebounded this month after a slowdown in August.\n\nEven so, the depressed levels of global bond yields are bound to leave some funds eager, and a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut next week could help open the door for greater risk taking.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely opportunities in these new names, but the investor has to spend more effort understanding the company,\u201d and why the issuer didn\u2019t raise funds in the offshore market earlier, said Kwok at DeepBlue.\n\nMany debut bonds are from China\u2019s state-owned companies and local government financing vehicles that don\u2019t have publicly traded equities. Their disclosures \u201ccan often be spotty,\u201d according to Teresa Kong, a San Francisco-based portfolio manager at Matthews Asia.\n\n\u201cEven if we have sufficient info to form an initial investment opinion, we typically do not have timely or sufficient access to financial, disclosures, and the management team over the long term,\u201d she said.\n\n(Updates with quote in eighth paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Adrian Yim.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Rebecca Choong Wilkins in Hong Kong at rchoongwilki@bloomberg.net;Annie Lee in Hong Kong at olee42@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Neha D'silva at ndsilva1@bloomberg.net, Christopher Anstey\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese companies trying to sell dollar bonds for the first time have been finding it a whole lot tougher lately.
