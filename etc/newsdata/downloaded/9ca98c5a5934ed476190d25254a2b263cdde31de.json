Having a wedding is just kind of locking it in and signing a contract.'\n\nHappy couple: Spencer Matthews has mocked wife Vogue Williams for being on her second marriage, insisting: 'There's nothing worse than divorce' (taken this month)\n\nSpeaking to MailOnline, Spencer said: 'I actually never gave marrying someone any thought prior to meeting Vogue.\n\n'I\u2019m not offering any advice because I suspect my advice is not welcome but I certainly wouldn\u2019t bother getting married unless it's truly deeply obvious it's the best thing.\n\n'I\u2019m actually trying to think of how I could make Vogue\u2019s life any better. Let\u2019s be honest, she\u2019s struck gold.'\n\nVogue added: 'It's different for different people. Our marriage is not as important to me as our relationship. Our relationship isn't just bound by being married. Having a wedding is just kind of locking it in and signing a contract.'\n\nTogether forever: But Vogue believes her relationship with Spencer 'isn't bound by being married' and 'having a wedding is just signing a contract' (taken this month)\n\nFormer lovers: Vogue was married to Westlife singer Brian McFadden for three years before splitting in 2015 (taken in 2015)\n\nKeen to reiterate his point, Spencer said: 'There's nothing worse than divorce in my opinion. Bad luck, darling' while Vogue quipped: 'He's my favourite roommate so far.'\n\nThe couple celebrated their vows last month with a glitzy wedding party which will be the culmination of their new reality series Vogue, Spencer and Wedding Two.\n\nBut before meeting Vogue on Channel 4 show The Jump, Spencer was known for his reputation as a ladies' man after dating a long list of his co-stars, including Caggie Dunlop, Louise Thompson, Stephanie Pratt and Lauren Hutton.\n\nVogue insists she wasn't put off by his womanising ways, saying: 'I didn\u2019t bother me.\n\n'When you meet him you'll instantly be charmed and he's just really good fun to be around so as soon as I met him I knew we were going to be pals forever but I didn't know we would get into a relationship.'\n\nSpencer joked: 'And as soon as I met Vogue I was just eyeing up that Irish coastline thinking \u201cHow can I land myself some property?\u201d\n\nSpeaking about his time playing the field, he added: 'I had fun while it lasted. I don't think I did anything a teenage boy doesn\u2019t dream of doing.\n\nSummer glow: The model, who runs fake tan business Bare by Vogue, insists she wasn't put off by Spencer's reputation as a ladies' man prior to dating him (taken this summer)\n\nGood times: The couple, who share 13-month-old son Theodore, married in 2018 in a secret loch-side ceremony at Spencer's family's Glenn Affric Estate in Scotland (taken this summer)\n\n'But you straighten up and you spend the rest of your life trying to delight another person. I wake up and I say to myself \u201cHow can I delight Vogue?\u201d and usually I succeed pretty quickly.'\n\nSpencer, who's a dad to the couple's 13-month-old baby Theodore, announced his TV career will be taking a backseat for the foreseeable future as he concentrates on a new business venture.\n\nBut Vogue says he would return to the small screen in a heartbeat to have the chance to present alongside Good Morning Britain host, Piers Morgan.\n\nShe said: 'If he had the chance to do anything with him he'd go back to TV.'\n\nSpencer added: 'I absolutely love Piers Morgan and there\u2019s absolutely no point in watching Good Morning Britain if he\u2019s not on it. He\u2019s usually right as well. If I could sit next to Piers and deliberate on issues that would be very fun.'", "description": "Spencer Matthews has mocked wife Vogue Williams for being on her second marriage, insisting: 'There's nothing worse than divorce.'
