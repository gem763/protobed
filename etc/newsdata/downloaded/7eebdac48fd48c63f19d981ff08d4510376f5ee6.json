(Note that the judge\u2019s language appears uncensored below.)\n\nThe brief argued that Halprin has a constitutional right to an impartial judge.\n\n\u201cWell into the twenty-first century, it is beyond dispute that a trial conducted before a racist judge who boasts of his bigotry is no trial at all,\u201d AJC general counsel Marc Stern said in a related press release.\n\nHalprin was sentenced to death in 2003 by then state District Judge Vickers \u201cVic\u201d Cunningham for his role in the so-called Texas 7 prison escape. Halprin was one of seven men who escaped from a South Texas prison in December 2000 and went on to commit several robberies, including a Christmas Eve crime in which a police officer was killed. Four members of the group have already been executed, the fifth killed himself before he could be recaptured, and the sixth is also set to be executed this year.\n\nThe push to stay Halprin\u2019s death date is part of a larger effort to obtain a new trial for him. Halprin\u2019s lawyers argued in a federal appeal in May that Cunningham was a \u201cracist and anti-Semitic bigot\u201d who privately described their client as \u201cthat fuckin\u2019 Jew\u201d and a \u201cgoddamn kike.\u201d Cunningham also believed in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Jewish people, the lawyers wrote.\n\n\u201cJudge Cunningham\u2019s prejudices, bias, and animus towards Jews precluded him from being the impartial judge the Due Process Clause of the Constitution requires,\u201d the appeal states. \u201cHis central role in the trial from start to finish constitutes a structural defect, and requires that the judgment of conviction and sentence of death be vacated.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers claimed that Cunningham would also use derogatory language and racial slurs to talk about African Americans, Latino Americans and Catholics.\n\nThe former judge did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nReuters Randy Halprin, one of the Texas 7 prison escapees, is led out of the Teller County Courthouse after an extradition hearing in Cripple Creek, Colorado, on Jan. 26, 2001.\n\nLast year, the Dallas News reported that Cunningham had set up a living trust with a clause that rewarded his children if they married white Christians of the opposite sex \u2015 an arrangement that Cunningham later confirmed. Family members described him as a \u201clifelong racist.\u201d\n\nCunningham told the Dallas News that his views on interracial marriage have evolved. He also denied the allegation that he harbored any racial bigotry.\n\nHe lost his race last year to become the GOP nominee for Dallas County commissioner.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League filed an amicus brief in support of Halprin in federal court in June.\n\nThe Jewish groups who signed onto Thursday\u2019s amicus brief declined to take a stance on Halprin\u2019s guilt or innocence. Instead, they argued that Cunningham should have recused himself from Halprin\u2019s case because of his biased views toward Jewish people. They are asking the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to stay Halprin\u2019s execution and order a hearing on the allegations against Cunningham.\n\n\u201cIf the allegations here are true \u2015 and they unfortunately ring true \u2013 the trial was no trial and the verdict was no verdict because the judge was no judge,\u201d Stern said.", "description": "The Texas judge presiding over Randy Halprin's case was a \u201cracist and anti-Semitic bigot,\" the inmate's lawyers contend.", "authors": ["Religion Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d729122240000e61f77c585.jpeg?cache=nfounjmqyq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
