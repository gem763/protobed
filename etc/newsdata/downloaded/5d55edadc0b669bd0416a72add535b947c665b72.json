In September, China said it plans to exclude American farm goods, including soybeans, from tariffs amid the trade talks.\n\nThe USTR said last week that China and the U.S. are close to finalizing a phase one deal. President Donald Trump has said the agreement will address intellectual property and financial services and include a pledge for China to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in American agricultural products.", "description": "Tariff exemptions on nearly 1,000 products are set to expire in December.", "authors": ["Lauren Hirsch"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106141576-1569008677187gettyimages-1158757966.jpeg?v=1572230174", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
