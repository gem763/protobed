(AP) - Connor Degenhardt threw a touchdown pass and ran for two scores and Holy Cross cashed in on a blocked field goal to beat winless Bucknell 21-14 in Saturday\u2019s Patriot League opener for both teams.\n\nTied at 14 in the third quarter, Kevin Bucceroni blocked Ethan Torres\u2019 37-yard attempt and the Crusaders (2-3) scored seven plays later on Degenhardt\u2019s 1-yard run.\n\nBucknell (0-5) jumped to a 14-0 lead on Chad Freshnock\u2019s 2-yard TD run and Gerrit Van Itallie\u2019s 52-yard pick-6 of a Degenhardt pass.\n\nDegenhardt hit Derek Mountain on a 33-yard scoring strike and tied it on a 1-yard sneak before halftime.\n\nThe Bison weren\u2019t able to generate much offense after Degenhardt\u2019s go-ahead score and were forced to punt on two drives and lost a fumble on another. Torres missed a 40-yard field goal try with 4:27 to play and the Crusaders ran out the clock from there.\n\nDegenhardt was 19 of 34 for 276 yards with two interceptions. Domenic Cozier gained 101 yards on 16 carries.\n\nBrandon Sanders had 14 catches for 122 yards for Bucknell.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Connor Degenhardt threw a touchdown pass and ran for two scores and Holy Cross cashed in on a blocked field goal to beat winless Bucknell 21-14 in Saturday's Patriot League opener for both teams.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
