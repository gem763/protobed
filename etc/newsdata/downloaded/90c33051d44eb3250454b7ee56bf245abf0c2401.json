When you label something like that, it sticks. Even if it isn't true.\n\n'People can go f*** themselves. People don't understand and try to look smart. I would check my stats after every game and I was running 10-11km every game. It doesn't make any difference for me. I was more bothered how I move and make space.'\n\nHe described his style as like being 'an artist on the pitch'.\n\n'I didn't realise it in the beginning but it was really important for me to do something different. If you watch me, you won't fall asleep or switch the channel. It might be a small movement, detail, how I control the ball or flick the ball.'", "description": "The former Manchester United and Tottenham striker divided opinion during his time in England for his attitude and approach, rather than his skill with a ball at his feet.", "authors": ["James Dutton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/16/19698074-0-image-a-103_1571065284676.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
