Cresset Asset Management, for instance, focuses on private and direct investments for its clients, and offers their employees\u2014and even clients\u2014an ownership stake in the firm, according to Michael Cole, Cresset\u2019s CEO.\n\nA key reason banks are interested in managing money for the ultra rich is profit. In a Credit Suisse presentation last year, the bank said the wealth management business for ultra-high-net-worth clients generates returns on investment of more than 30%, compared to returns of greater than 15% for high-net-worth clients and returns in the range of 10% to 15% for the affluent, according to Johann Scholtz, an equity analyst at Morningstar.\n\nThe number of ultra wealthy\u2014those with at least US$30 million in investable assets\u2014rose by 9.5% in North America to 90,440 in 2017, according to Wealth-X\u2019s latest report on the sector. Combined, these individuals hold at least $11 trillion in wealth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of scale,\u201d Scholtz says. \u201cPortfolios are bigger, and [wealth managers] are able to sell more complex and more bespoke products to that group\u2014which you can\u2019t do with other clients\u2014and the [client] churn rate is much lower.\u201d\n\nIn other words, investors with more complex needs are less likely to switch between different banks.\n\nBanks also are leaning more on their wealth management businesses because they provide a \u201crevenue stream that\u2019s not related to the interest-rate cycle,\u201d Scholtz says. But, he adds, not all banks can jump into this business because they can\u2019t offer the services that the ultra-wealthy require. \u201cThe barriers to entry are much lower at the bottom of the wealth pyramid.\u201d\n\nUBS Creates Family Office Solutions Group\n\nFor UBS Global Wealth Management, the \u201cultra-high-net worth business in the United States has been the fastest growing business that we have,\u201d says John Mathews, head of the firm\u2019s ultra practice.\n\nMathews expects this growth will continue, particularly as aging Baby Boomer business owners sell their companies, potentially reaping hundreds of millions. These aren\u2019t necessarily the country\u2019s next billionaires, but \u201cit\u2019s the family that sells a pipe-fitting company in Louisiana for $325 million,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually an underserved market.\u201d\n\nBillionaires whose wealth already is managed through a well-staffed institutional family office are covered by UBS\u2019s global family office group, which can provide the \u201cinstitutional connectivity,\u201d these investors need for electronic trading, global custody, or leveraged lending.\n\nBut to serve the growing wealth tier below that\u2014those with at least US$100 million\u2014UBS in January created what it calls the \u201cfamily office solutions group.\u201d The goal is to provide the kind of customized, comprehensive advice and services that wealthy individuals require without having to set up their own personal family office.\n\nWhile UBS has offered similar expertise and services to its wealthiest clients in the past, this new effort puts 20 product specialists and experts in topics like philanthropy in one group that the firm\u2019s financial advisors can tap. Aside from advisory services (like trust and estates) and transaction services (like lending or alternative investments), the group can take care of administrative tasks for families, such as consolidating reporting, and concierge services.\n\n\u201cWe can either act as the family office to the client or we can be the family office to their family office,\u201d Mathews says.\n\nA Nimble Competitor\n\nCresset Asset Management, which was formed two years ago by private-equity firm founders Avy Stein and Eric Becker, is aiming to fill this wealth niche, too, although focusing on providing family office services to those with a net worth of at least $10 million, says CEO Cole, formerly head of Ascent.\n\n\u201cClients are going from entrepreneurs to what I call capital-preneurs\u2014their business is becoming the business of capital, and they\u2019re not experienced in doing that,\u201d Cole says.\n\nThe problem is a former entrepreneur who was really good at building a trucking company doesn\u2019t know how to manage a $200 million fortune, and the resulting investment decisions, and family decisions, that it requires. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity,\u201d Cole says.\n\nBank of America Private Bank\n\nBank of America Private Bank\u2019s growth is evident in the expectation it will have 600 financial advisors by the end of next year, double the number it had in 2014. Perhaps more significantly, the client-facing teams working with those advisors\u2014portfolio managers, trust officers, credit specialists\u2014has grown 15% in the last year-and-a-half, says Katy Knox, president of the private bank, which was known as U.S. Trust until a February name change.\n\n\u201cWhat we really tried to do is support the entire team and add resources,\u201d Knox says.\n\nThe private bank also is seeking growth within the 90 U.S. markets already served by its parent. From a presence in about 33 markets today, the bank plans to be in 40 of the top 50 by the end of 2019. This will allow it to better build on relationships the bank already has with customers who may be a natural fit with the private bank. Knox notes that bank\u2019s internal referrals are up 55% from a year ago.\n\n\u201cIf you work with your partners in the consumer bank, small business, business banking, commercial banking, and investment banking\u2014you don\u2019t really have to leave the building to get a new client, you just have to be a great partner,\u201d Knox says.\n\nU.S. Bank\u2019s Boutique Strategy in Ascent\n\nU.S. Bank\u2019s Ascent Private Capital Management, only eight years old, focuses solely on ultra-wealthy families with at least US$75 million in net worth. The boutique unit functions more like a multi-family office, providing services like legacy planning and family governance, what the firm likes to call wealth sustainability\u2014\u201call the stuff that goes along with keeping the family together,\u201d says John Zimmerman, Ascent\u2019s president.\n\nThat focus on family legacy is the core of Ascent\u2019s approach to the extent that half of the group\u2019s clients don\u2019t even hold assets with the firm. Instead, Zimmerman says, \u201cwe approach a family with a holistic and integrated approach to managing what may, in many cases, be a business enterprise into their family enterprise.\u201d\n\nThe challenge for wealth managers who want to serve this market won\u2019t be delivering a few percentage points more return to their client\u2019s investments he argues, it\u2019s \u201chow do we stay coincident with, or ahead of, the demands of our clients,\u201d he says.\n\nAmong shifts in the landscape are changing definitions of families, longer-living matriarchs and patriarchs, and the rising influence of younger generations on how a family deploys its wealth.\n\n\u201cTypically, it was the wealth creators pushing their values down,\u201d Zimmerman says. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing millennials effect change up.\u201d", "description": "To capture a profitable sector, banks are focusing more on services that keep families intact", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-108685/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
