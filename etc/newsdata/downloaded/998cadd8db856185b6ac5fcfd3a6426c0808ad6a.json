World powers including the U.S. and some European countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, have blamed the attack on Iran, but Yemeni Houthi group \u2014 supported by Tehran \u2014 have claimed responsibility. Tehran has denied involvement.\n\nThe increased rhetoric between the two countries raised concerns about the risk of war in the Middle East, and sent oil prices surging amid concerns of supply disruptions. In response to the attacks, the Trump administration announced plans to deploy U.S. forces to the region.", "description": "The U.S. has imposed new sanctions on several Chinese entities for \"knowingly engaging\" in transporting Iranian oil \u2014 a violation of Washington's curbs on the Islamic Republic.", "authors": ["Huileng Tan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106142895-1569162338573gettyimages-1167242151.jpeg?v=1569464499", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
