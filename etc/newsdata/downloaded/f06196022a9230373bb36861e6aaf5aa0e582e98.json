Electricity emissions are falling rapidly and we are well on track to reducing emissions by 26 per cent in the NEM eight or nine years ahead of the 2030 target year. This is contributing to a clear pathway to reach our 2030 targets across the whole economy.\n\nBut record investments in renewables are associated with falling reliability and rising prices. In South Australia, Labor\u2019s 50 per cent state renewable energy target led to amongst the highest prices in the world, with falling reliability. Victoria has the same policy, with the same outcomes: 200,000 consumers lost power in January and Victoria has the highest wholesale prices in the NEM. We can expect the same wherever governments pursue these policies without balancing investment in dispatchable generation.\n\nThis really matters. Affordable, reliable energy matters to productivity, and it matters to fairness. It is amongst the most basic of services to industry, small business and households. Make it unaffordable, and the least equipped wear the greatest burden.\n\nAvoiding the danger zone\n\nMarkets enter the danger zone when \u2018on-demand\u2019 or \u2018dispatchable\u2019 generation cross the critical threshold of falling below peak demand.\n\nVictoria and South Australia are in the most trouble, where dispatchable capacity is less than peak demand.\n\nBoth states lack the generation they need to consistently meet demand and to contain prices, although SA is now working hard to address this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we go back in time, Victoria was short of capacity in 2009, when prices rose and reliability fell. This was addressed when the Mortlake gas generator was completed, taking pressure off prices and improving reliability. Since then, no dispatchable generators have been built in Victoria, Hazelwood exited, gas exploration and development has ceased and so serious problems have re-emerged.\n\nThis is set to get worse without reforms. The economics and engineering of inflexible baseload coal and gas generators are deteriorating fast as utilisation drops. Worse, if the owners of baseload generators fear future policy bias to intermittent renewables, or fear carbon pricing, they will not invest in those generators.\n\nFocusing on common ground\n\nSome still believe that the right answer is to double down on more aggressive renewable energy targets or emissions targets and associated subsidies. Labor took such a policy to the election, and some Labor states persist with these policies. This can only be described as policy insanity given the clear impact on price and reliability, particularly in the absence of mitigating policies. Reckless targets will end badly, and we believe (as does the ACCC) they need to be scaled down and phased out. The low and falling costs of solar, in particular, will ensure enough renewable investment to smash our targets in the electricity sector.\n\nDespite this area of disagreement, there are some things most wise heads can agree on.\n\nFirst, retaining and attracting on-demand \u2018dispatchable\u2019 capacity is crucial.\n\nSecondly, competition and reliability have been impacted by the withdrawal of big baseload generators like Hazelwood, hitting hardest when the sun goes down (or the wind doesn\u2019t blow) even if prices are low (or even negative) when nature cooperates.\n\nThirdly, we know hydro can play a role in providing flexible on demand power which is why the commonwealth is investing in Snowy and Marinus link. But ready access to affordable gas for flexible generation will also need to play a big role in addressing the challenge of an otherwise unstable grid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFourthly, there will need to be investment in transmission to address these issues, particularly as new generation connects to the grid. However, States can\u2019t rely on dispatchable generation across the border as a solution to their problems.\n\nFinally, beyond pump hydro, zero emissions dispatchable generation or storage are still immature outside of niche applications. Batteries, hydrogen, carbon sequestration, biofuels or even the new nuclear technologies all have potential and some targeted applications (like batteries for short term frequency control), but the economics and engineering of these technologies for broadscale deployment are still challenging. We shouldn\u2019t pretend any one of them is a silver bullet.\n\nIf we can agree on these things, then the question is where to from here.\n\nEncouraging investment in affordable capacity\n\nFirst, we need strong signals to invest in dispatchable capacity where we are short \u2013 as we are in SA and Victoria with real risks in NSW. In electricity markets, the cap price signals a need for capacity. But the market is relatively immature and illiquid. The signals simply aren\u2019t strong enough.\n\nOnce the Retailer Reliability Obligation (RRO) is triggered in individual markets, it is likely to strengthen incentives.\n\nWhen these obligations are triggered, it will be a test of the effectiveness of the RRO. The reliability standards are set at a lower level than many other countries around the world: We only plan to meet the reliability standard every second year, no \u2018reserve margin\u2019 is built and in AEMO\u2019s modelling of peak requirements extreme scenarios are given low probabilities. This will need ongoing evaluation.\n\nThe future of the RERT (reliability and emergency reserve trader) is also an important consideration. This is a short-term mechanism, not a genuine strategic reserve, and some take the view that a longer-term strategic reserve is ultimately going to be necessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there is one message I want to pass on to industry participants and investors, it is this. We must ensure there is a strong incentive to invest in dispatchable capacity, particularly in markets where reliable capacity is dangerously low. Doing so will not just improve reliability and security \u2013 it will put downward pressure on prices.\n\nManaging intermittency with day ahead commitments\n\nAlong with longer-term market signals to encourage dispatchable capacity, we need participants to commit to meet customers\u2019 daily needs ahead of time, with consequences for failing to meet those commitments. As more generation becomes intermittent, the need for participants to deliver firm supply ahead of time increases.\n\nThere are essentially two pathways \u2013 day ahead scheduling commitments with clear penalties for failure to deliver, or a day ahead settlement system. AEMO and AEMC are working on this, and I have asked them to bring forward the best pathway forward as quickly as possible.\n\nAvoiding premature closure of baseload generators\n\nWe also need to strengthen the process for retaining dispatchable generation - mostly baseload coal and gas - in the absence of a compelling replacement plan. This will have more impact on pricing and reliability than anything else we do.\n\nThe threat of premature baseload closures is dire. Price forecasts have consistently underestimated the pressure on inflexible coal and gas generators when the sun is shining. You simply can\u2019t keep burning gas and coal all day to supply electricity for a few hours when the sun goes down.\n\nThe goal must be to create a sensible precedent for how we deal with planned closures in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnsuring gas is affordable\n\nGas has an enormously important role to play in the electricity grid in coming years, let alone as a standalone fuel source to households, small businesses and industry.\n\nThe Government has launched a series of initiatives to improve gas industry outcomes. In particular, we need the local prices to reflect a genuine international \u2018netback\u2019. And the best way to achieve that will always be more supply.\n\nThis debate typically focuses on reservation. We already have de facto reservation. Once supply exceeds domestic demand and export capacity, the remaining gas must be reserved. In the absence of new export facilities (which won\u2019t happen any time soon), all the excess gas must be reserved. So my number one message to the gas producers and state governments is deliver more gas production, and fast. And that means getting rid of moratoria. Now.\n\nPutting customers back in charge\n\nAs the ACCC and others have pointed out, the NEM is not working as a competitive market should. Modellers of the NEM don\u2019t agree on everything, but most now agree that wholesale prices are well above what we would expect in a competitive market.\n\nWell-targeted investment in reliable supply and competition will put downward pressure on prices, even if there are some additional costs.\n\nWhere these initiatives can be pursued by the Commonwealth, we are getting on with it. In many cases, further reforms require COAG support. I have written to the ESB, AEMO and AEMC, asking them to focus on this agenda, and I will be bringing forward a commonwealth sponsored paper to the upcoming COAG Energy Council meeting. This work will need sustained focus and a sense of urgency, without distractions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also important to recognise the role of the states and territories, first through COAG. They play equally important roles through their direct policies \u2013 on renewable subsidies, gas exploration and investment, coal generation and transmission. They can be a force for good and we are committed to collaborate with states and territories that do the right thing. We will also call out bad behaviour and we won\u2019t accept accountability for errant states and territories.\n\nAbove all, this is about putting customers first. Small businesses, households and communities dependent on industry all want the same thing: Reliable, affordable energy, while we meet our international emissions obligations without trashing jobs and incomes.\n\nThis is an edited transcript of a speech to The Australian Financial Review Energy Summit in Sydney by Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor on Wednesday.", "description": "The market must take on the challenge of balancing investment in renewables with attracting and retaining reliable electricity supply.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2805%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_289%2C$y_28/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c4e03d2f2c7bbdc6d203b60d3158544f7a056568", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
