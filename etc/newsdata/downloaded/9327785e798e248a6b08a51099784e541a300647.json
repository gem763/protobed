Bush And Ellen DeGeneres Debate Question", "language": "en", "text": "Almost three hours into the Democratic debate Tuesday night, neither the presidential candidates nor viewers seemed all too impressed when CNN host Anderson Cooper wrapped up the night with a question about Ellen DeGeneres and George W. Bush\u2019s friendship \u2015 despite not bringing up climate change once.\n\n\u201cLast week, Ellen Degeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, \u2018We\u2019re all different and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s OK, that we\u2019re all different,\u2019\u201d Cooper said at the conclusion of the debate. \u201cSo in that spirit, we\u2019d like you to tell us about a friendship that you\u2019ve had that would surprise us and what impacts it\u2019s had on you and your beliefs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Daily Show\u201d was quick to mock the moment with a picture of the faces of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former Vice President Joe Biden:\n\nWhen you're eight hours into the debate and Anderson Cooper asks a question about Ellen pic.twitter.com/19orEhk50U \u2014 The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) October 16, 2019\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who was the first to answer the question on stage, tweeted several suggestions for a more useful question:\n\nThree hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration.\n\n\n\nClimate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.\n\n\n\nBut you know, Ellen.#DemocraticDebate \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 16, 2019\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, another candidate on the stage, also tweeted to point out issues that were neglected:\n\nThree hours.\n\n\n\nNot one question about the climate crisis.\n\n\n\nNot one question about LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n\n\nNot one question about immigration.\n\n\n\nThese issues are too important to ignore. #DemDebate \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 16, 2019\n\nAnd Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year after launching a campaign focused around climate action, also had something to say:\n\nNot one single question about the climate crisis.\n\nNot one single question about the climate crisis.\n\nNot one single question about the climate crisis.\n\n\n\nThis is the existential crisis of our time. Not one single question, and that\u2019s completely inexcusable. #DemDebate \u2014 Jay Inslee (@JayInslee) October 16, 2019\n\nViewers on Twitter weren\u2019t too pleased with the question either, given immigration, climate change, housing poverty, LGBTQ issues and various other topics were entirely neglected in the Tuesday night debate:\n\nHey, let\u2019s do 20 closing minutes on that Ellen/Bush meme thing. Immigration and climate change can wait until the next debate, if the world is still here. \u2014 Nathan P. Ghoul (@nathanpgale) October 16, 2019\n\nI can't believe we're going to listen to a whole slate of answers on Ellen Degeneres when there hasn't been a single question on climate change? \u2014 Zack Beauchamp (@zackbeauchamp) October 16, 2019\n\nReally @CNN? Ending on an Ellen related question?!!!\n\n\n\nFor next debate, please get on the following:\n\n\n\nClimate justice\n\nCrisis at the border\n\nHate crimes\n\nWhite supremacy\n\nVoting rights#DemDebate \u2014 Ify Ike (@IfyWorks) October 16, 2019\n\nCNN thought it was more important to use Ellen hanging out with a war criminal as a jumping off point to ask about bipartisan friendships than ask about the largest existential threat facing humanity \u2014 Brian Kahn (@blkahn) October 16, 2019\n\nMy answer to this Ellen question is that Republicans are trying to take your health care away. \u2014 Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) October 16, 2019\n\nWait... did they really just ask an Ellen question? I can\u2019t. I\u2019m out. #DemDebate \u2014 Steven Canals (@StevenCanals) October 16, 2019\n\nthe world: [literally on fire]\n\n\n\nanderson cooper: lol did u guys see ellen \u2014 BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) October 16, 2019\n\nANDERSON COOPER: Irreversible climate change is going to doom all mankind to a painful heat death if we don't act soon. So, obviously, I've gotta ask: Who's your shittiest friend and why \u2014 The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) October 16, 2019\n\nEllen Degeneres and George Bush at a football game got more air time during the debates than China and Hong Kong. That is all you need to know about the state of American civic affairs. #DemocraticDebate \u2014 Joshua Claybourn (@JoshuaClaybourn) October 16, 2019", "description": "The Democratic debate candidates were not asked about climate change or immigration. \"But you know, Ellen,\" Julian Castro tweeted.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da698742000009b0d505966.jpeg?cache=jq3juce9qk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
