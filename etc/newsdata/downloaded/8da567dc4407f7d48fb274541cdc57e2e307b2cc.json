The weather service is part of NOAA and the tweet came from its Birmingham, Alabama, office.\n\n\u201cThis rewriting history to satisfy an ego diminishes NOAA,\u201d Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday, former Republican-appointed director of the National Weather Service, said on Facebook. He told The Associated Press on Saturday: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get the point where science is determined by politics rather than science and facts. And I\u2019m afraid this is an example where this is beginning to occur.\u201d\n\nAlabama had never been included in hurricane advisories and Trump\u2019s information, based on less authoritative graphics than an official forecast, was outdated even at the time.\n\nIn the tempestuous aftermath, some meteorologists spoke on social media of protesting when the acting NOAA chief, Neil Jacobs , is scheduled to speak at a National Weather Association meeting Tuesday \u2014 in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nFormer officials saw a political hand at work in NOAA\u2019s statement disavowing the Birmingham tweet. The statement was issued by an anonymous \u201cspokesperson,\u201d a departure from the norm for federal agencies that employ people to speak for them by name.\n\n\u201cThis falls into such uncharted territory,\u201d said W. Craig Fugate, who was Florida emergency management chief under Republican Gov. Jeb Bush and director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Democratic President Barack Obama. \u201cYou have science organizations putting out statements against their own offices. For the life of me I don\u2019t think I would have ever faced this under President Obama or Governor Bush.\u201d\n\nJane Lubchenco, NOAA administrator during the Obama administration said: \u201cIt is truly sad to see political appointees undermining the superb, life-saving work of NOAA\u2019s talented and dedicated career servants. Scientific integrity at a science agency matters.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to comment Saturday when asked if it had directed NOAA to release the statement. The president spent the morning at his Virginia golf club. NOAA officials also didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nRetired Adm. David Titley, former NOAA operations chief during the Obama administration and a former meteorology professor at Pennsylvania State University said NOAA\u2019s leadership is showing \u201cmoral cowardice\u201d and officials should have resigned instead of issuing the statement chastising the Birmingham office. Joe Friday said he would have quit had he been in top officials\u2019 shoes.\n\nTitley said the episode might feed distrust of forecasts that help people make life-or-death decisions whether to evacuate.\n\n\u201cFor people who look for excuses not to take action when their lives or property are threatened ... I think this can potentially feed that,\u201d Titley said.\n\nFormer NOAA deputy administration Monica Medina, who served in the Obama and Clinton administrations, said \u201cit will make us less safe as a country.\u201d\n\nAnd Justin Kenney, who headed the agency\u2019s communications in the Obama administration, said \u201cby politicizing weather forecasts, the president ... puts more people \u2014 including first responders \u2014 in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nBill Read, who became director of the National Hurricane Center director during the Republican George W. Bush administration, said on Facebook the NOAA statement showed either an embarrassing lack of understanding of forecasting or \u201ca lack of courage on their part by not supporting the people in the field who are actually doing the work. Heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nA retired chief of the center\u2019s hurricane forecasting desk, James Franklin, said on Twitter that the NOAA statement had thrown the Birmingham office \u201cunder the bus\u201d \u2014 a phrase several ex-officials used. He said the Birmingham office\u2019s tweet was \u201cspot-on and an appropriate response to the President\u2019s misleading tweet that morning.\u201d\n\nLast Sunday, Trump tweeted : \u201cIn addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the hurricane center\u2019s forecast path \u2014 including a large cone of uncertainty \u2014 did not go farther west than the eastern third of Georgia.\n\nThe weather service in Birmingham quickly followed up with its tweet, which one meteorologist there said was prompted by residents\u2019 concerns about what to do. It said: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d\n\nNOAA verified that day that the \u201ccurrent forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama\u201d and an agency spokesman, Christopher Vaccaro, put his name to that.\n\nNOAA\u2019s disavowal of the Birmingham tweet came late Friday. It said its forecasters \u201cspoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nThe highest percentage that tropical force storm winds \u2014 not stronger hurricane-force winds \u2014 would hit somewhere in Alabama was 11%, according to hurricane center charts, and the chances were briefly between 20% and 30% according to a graphic that was not a forecast and that was outdated by the time of Trump\u2019s warning.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
