We will look at the timing of that (amendment) because the deal will be debated on Saturday and then you\u2019ll have to have the legislation brought forward.\n\n'There are discussions taking place about when is the right time to put an amendment down and, to be frank, I think on Saturday we should just vote the deal down, because it is such a bad deal.\n\n'And then maybe the Government will wake up and start working with other political parties about a sensible deal the British people can have before them.'\n\nMr McDonnell told the BBC's Today programme: 'There are discussions taking place about when is the right time to put an amendment down and, to be frank, I think on Saturday we should just vote the deal down, because it is such a bad deal'\n\nRemainer MPs had hoped to amend the Prime Minister\u2019s deal to add a \u2018confirmatory\u2019 public vote \u2013 ensuring it had to be approved by the public before Brexit could take place\n\nLast night Labour's Peter Kyle, the mover behind legislation to force a second referendum, indicated he might still attempt to force an amendment through on Saturday.\n\nHe tweeted: 'Our proposal was always about consensus and still is. We have the amendment drafted, we have bags of support for it, and tomorrow (Friday) lunchtime will take the decision about when we\u2019ll table it.'\n\nThe plan to amend the deal on Saturday is thought to have been quietly pulled in order to give it the best chance to succeed in future.\n\nA source familiar with the campaign said: \u2018The focus on Saturday has to be stopping the deal. The best chance of getting a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d may well be after this deal is defeated.\u2019\n\nHad MPs managed to successfully amend the deal to add a second referendum it is likely Downing Street would have pulled it entirely before it actually came to a final vote. Mr Johnson\u2019s government has repeatedly made clear its implacable opposition to a second public vote.\n\nThe decision by Remainer MPs to back away yesterday followed confusion over whether Labour would actually back a second referendum in a vote on \u2018Super Saturday\u2019.\n\nFormer Tory backbencher Sir Oliver Letwin had led the attempt to change the timetable for the sitting \u2013 allowing for amendments to be tabled and voted on\n\nSpeaking soon after it was announced a deal had been done, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u2018The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\u2019\n\nHowever, he added he did not \u2018suspect\u2019 that the option of holding a second referendum vote would arise on Saturday, when Parliament is due to give its verdict on Mr Johnson\u2019s agreement.\n\nHe then described reports that Labour could back such a vote as \u2018high-level speculation on a hypothetical question\u2019.\n\nIn a sign of the deep split within the party, members of Mr Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet have since said they plan to make the \u2018argument\u2019 for a second referendum to the Prime Minister themselves.\n\nJeremy Corbyn said: \u2018The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote\u2019\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said they would vote for the deal at its third reading if a referendum was attached to it.\n\nFormer Tory backbencher Sir Oliver Letwin had led the attempt to change the timetable for tomorrow\u2019s sitting \u2013 allowing for amendments to be tabled and voted on.\n\nIt passed by 287 votes to 275, and means an amendment to Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans to include a proposed second referendum is now possible. Sir Oliver suggested that it could close a loophole in the so-called Benn Act \u2013 which requires the PM to seek a Brexit delay if he does not have a deal by October 19. The law only compels the PM to seek an extension if MPs fail to pass a motion.\n\nHe told MPs: \u2018That will enable those of us, like me, who wish to support and carry through and eventually see the ratification of this deal, not to put us in the position of allowing the Government off the Benn Act hook on Saturday.\u2019\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson speaking at the European Council summit at EU headquarters in Brussels, October 17\n\nThe original plan advanced by proponents of a \u2018confirmatory vote\u2019 was that MPs would pass an amendment making the Brexit deal conditional on a referendum. Once it was amended, they would then vote with the Government for the deal.\n\nBut a number of Labour MPs have concerns about anything that would appear to be offering support to Mr Johnson, and a potentially larger group have concerns about supporting a referendum at all.\n\nEarlier this month, 19 Labour MPs in favour of leaving the EU with a deal wrote to Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, asking the pair to \u2018work night and day\u2019 to secure a Withdrawal Agreement they could back.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether those backbenchers will support Mr Johnson tomorrow.\n\nYesterday, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove told BBC Politics Live there would not be a second referendum.\n\n\u2018Ain\u2019t gonna happen,\u2019 he said. \u2018Ain\u2019t gonna be no second referendum. It just won\u2019t happen.\u2019", "description": "The shadow chancellor distanced the party from an attempt to hijack tomorrow's meaningful vote.
