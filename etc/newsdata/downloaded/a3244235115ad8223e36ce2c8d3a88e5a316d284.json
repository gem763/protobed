Huawei has so far mainly sold smartphones that were launched before the ban.\n\nIts newest Mate 30 smartphone - which lacks access to a licensed version of Google\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Android operating system - started sales last month.\n\nHuawei in August said the curbs would hurt less than initially feared, but could still push its smartphone unit\u2019s revenue lower by about $10 billion this year.\n\nThe tech giant did not break down third-quarter figures but said on Wednesday revenue for the first three quarters of the year grew 24.4% to 610.8 billion yuan.\n\nRevenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to 165.29 billion yuan ($23.28 billion) according to Reuters calculations based on previous statements from Huawei.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A Huawei logo is pictured at their store at Vina del Mar, Chile July 18, 2019. REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido/File Photo\n\n\u201cHuawei\u2019s overseas shipments bounced back quickly in the third quarter although they are yet to return to pre-US ban levels,\u201d said Nicole Peng, vice president for mobility at consultancy Canalys.\n\n\u201cThe Q3 result is truly impressive given the tremendous pressure the company is facing. But it is worth noting that strong shipments were driven by devices launched pre-US ban, and the long-term outlook is still dim,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cSTRONG PERFORMANCE\u201d\n\nThe company said it has shipped 185 million smartphones so far this year. Based on the company\u2019s previous statements and estimates from market research firm Strategy Analytics, that indicates a 29% surge in third-quarter smartphone shipments.\n\nStill, growth in the third quarter slowed from the 39% increase the company reported in the first quarter. Huawei did not break out figures for the second quarter either, but has said revenue rose 23.2% in the first half of the year.\n\n\u201cOur continued strong performance in Q3 shows our customers\u2019 trust in Huawei, our technology and services, despite the actions and unfounded allegations against us by some national governments,\u201d Huawei spokesman Joe Kelly told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. government alleges Huawei is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy. Huawei has repeatedly denied its products pose a security threat.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A Huawei company logo is pictured at the Shenzhen International Airport in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China July 22, 2019.
