Residents are moving ancestors' bones to dry land.", "language": "en", "text": "The Turkish city of Hasankeyf has been around for roughly 12,000 years, but in a matter of months, its ancient caves, churches, and tombs could disappear underwater.\n\nUnlike coastal cities like Jakarta, Indonesia, or New Orleans, Louisiana, Hasankeyf isn't a victim of rising seas. Instead, much of the city is set to be flooded by a dam project that's designed to bring hydroelectric power to the region.\n\nMany of Hasankeyf's residents have already been relocated to a newly constructed town about 2 miles away. The government has also transported monuments like a 12th-century Islamic monastery and a 1,800-ton bath house to a nearby plain. Residents are even moving the bones of their ancestors to the new town.\n\nBut many of Hasankeyf's archeological remains will be submerged in water once the dam's reservoir is filled. Take a look at the city before it gets inundated.", "description": "The Turkish government has called for the evacuation of a 12,000-year-old city, which is about to get flooded with water from the Tigris River.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d892bcc2e22af29761a5d66-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
