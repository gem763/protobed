The Detroit-area congressman was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n\u201cI was deeply saddened by the passing of Congressman John Conyers today,\u201d Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said in a written statement released by his office.\n\n\u201cFrom co-founding the Congressional Black Caucus to leading the fight in Congress to enshrine Martin Luther King\u2019s birthday as a national holiday, John Conyers\u2019 impact on our city and nation will never be forgotten,\u201d Duggan said.\n\nJust days after King was assassinated in 1968, Conyers introduced legislation to create a holiday honoring the civil rights leader. Conyers pursued the matter for 15 years until President Ronald Reagan signed it into law in 1983.\n\nCivil rights pioneer Rosa Parks, who famously refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus in 1955, worked on his Detroit staff for more than two decades before retiring in 1988.\n\nIn November 2017, the House Ethics Committee said it was investigating allegations of sexual harassment against Conyers, who said his office had resolved a harassment case with a payment but no admission of guilt.\n\nThe allegations arose as Congress reviewed how to handle sexual harassment complaints and followed a string of similar accusations against prominent figures in the U.S. media, Hollywood and politics. Conyers stepped down on Dec. 5, 2017, although saying the harassment allegations were \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\nConyers had been doggedly critical of the U.S. drive to launch the Iraq war, calling in 2005 for Congress to censure President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for misleading lawmakers and the American people.\n\nThe Bush administration\u2019s central justification for the war, begun in March 2003, was the threat posed by Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons were found.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Representative John Conyers addresses the audience during a program to announce the first round of loan commitments to transform older factories during a news conference at the Ford Motor Research & Innovation Center in Dearborn, Michigan June 23, 2009.

The Senate ultimately declined to remove Clinton from office.\n\nConyers investigated the 2004 U.S. presidential election in which Bush edged Democrat John Kerry, with Bush\u2019s narrow victory in Ohio proving pivotal. Conyers\u2019 report said that \u201cnumerous serious election irregularities\u201d and Republican misconduct tilted Ohio to Bush.\n\nCritics felt the Detroit native and son of an autoworkers\u2019 union official was, as writer Joe Klein put it in Time magazine, \u201cfoolishly incendiary.\u201d Supporters felt otherwise. Marcus Raskin of the Institute for Policy Studies think tank told Newhouse News Service in 2006: \u201cHe\u2019s a cannon but he\u2019s not loose.\u201d\n\nConyers, a lawyer, became the first black lawmaker to serve as House Judiciary Committee chairman, although a criminal case involving his wife caused him embarrassment at the time.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nMonica Conyers, a former Detroit city councilwoman, was sentenced in 2010 to 37 months in prison for accepting bribes from a waste management company trying to win city business. The Justice Department said there was no evidence the congressman knew about his wife\u2019s conduct.\n\nConyers led the 1989 impeachment and removal of a black federal judge, Alcee Hastings, for corruption. Hastings later was elected to the House. Conyers also proposed a commission to consider reparations for descendants of slaves.\n\nIn 1989 and 1993, Conyers ran for Detroit mayor but lost.", "description": "John Conyers, a liberal Democrat who was the longest-serving African-American member of the U.S. House of Representatives, serving for more than half a century, died on Sunday at the age of 90.", "authors": ["Will Dunham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445618601&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0SJ", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
