If they fail, they can retake the test second time.\n\nAfter a second failure, the applicant can take a class or try a third time.", "description": "The test will cover what the government is calling \"democratic values and Quebec values.\" Applicants will have to pass with a score of at least 75 per cent in order to obtain a\u00a0selection certificate.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5340656.1572438734!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/francois-legault-jolin-barrette.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
