They don\u2019t need to know today.\u201d\n\nThis result meant the Wallaby boss has presided over seven straight losses to England since his former team-mate at Sydney club Randwick, Eddie Jones, took charge of the Red Rose brigade after the 2015 World Cup.\n\n\u201cExit is an exit, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a final or quarter-final,\u201d said Cheika.\n\n\u201cThe opponent is irrelevant. For all the carry-on (exchanges between Cheika and Jones), we are just going out to compete\u2026 it\u2019s painful either way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel that weight that I should have delivered for them (Australia fans).\u201d\n\nEngland outscored Australia four tries to one, with wing Jonny May marking his 50th cap with a first-half double in three minutes.\n\nProp Kyle Sinckler crossed for the first time in Test rugby before Anthony Watson went over four minutes from the finish.\n\nEngland captain Owen Farrell was faultless from the kicking tee, landing eight out of eight shots for a match haul of 20 points.\n\nYet Australia, thanks to a converted try from wing Marika Koroibete were only a point behind at 17-16 early in the second half.\n\nThe Wallabies gave away two intercept tries but Cheika insisted that playing a tighter game was \u201cnot the Australian way\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go to a kick-and-defend game. Call me naive but that\u2019s not the way we want to play.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Jones, Australia\u2019s coach when they lost the 2003 World Cup final to England, was asked if he felt any sympathy for Cheika.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough when you lose a game, particularly at this level,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut not a lot of sympathy now because I\u2019m enjoying the win and I think I\u2019m allowed to enjoy the win.\u201d", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Dejected Australia coach Michael Cheika urged the media to show \u201ccompassion\u201d when asked about his future after", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/4c3407_australia-head-coach-michael-cheika-was-left-dejected-by-defeat-england-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
