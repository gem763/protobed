As well as operating in established markets in Western Europe and Latin America, the Barcelona, Spain-based Glovo has also entered emerging delivery markets in Eastern Europe and West Africa.\n\nEssentially, Glovo aims to deliver anything a city-dweller might need or want, much like the US firm Postmates. This includes food (which Pierre says represents about two-thirds of Glovo's business), pharmaceuticals, groceries, and smartphone accessories. It means Glovo is in direct competition with firms like Uber and Amazon's Deliveroo.\n\n'The idea of everything in your city being delivered \u2014 I just found it very cool'\n\nAfter graduating from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2012, Pierre worked as an aerodynamics engineer in Toulouse, France, but he eventually decided to start afresh, cofounding Glovo in early 2015 with a fellow Spanish tech entrepreneur named Sacha Michaud.\n\n\"I was finishing my degree in the US, and went to San Francisco for the weekend, where I saw the concept of Postmates,\" Pierre tells Business Insider. \"The idea of everything in your city being delivered \u2014 I just found it very cool. Postmates was my inspiration.\"\n\nPierre founded Glovo in early 2015 alongside Sacha Michaud. Glovo\n\nA natural entrepreneur, Pierre had already founded two online companies while studying: Zikkomo.com, a donations platform sponsoring 30 children in Malawi, and LoveItLocal.es, a website aimed at boosting local craft businesses. But Glovo was a different beast.\n\n\"We started with a very broad proposition, which was basically: We'll get you anything you want from your city,\" he recalls. \"What we realized after two years was that, in order to build a very big company, we had to have a very good food-delivery category. Food delivery was our biggest focus for some time.\"\n\nStaring down financial ruin\n\nToday, Glovo partners with giant multinationals such as McDonald's and family-run businesses that can monetize the Glovo platform. Its revenue stood at 81 million euros, or $92 million, in 2018, which was up 350% from 18 million euros in the year before. But, as recently as 2017, Glovo was staring into the abyss.\n\n\"We were famous in Spain for a while as the startup with the most [rejections] from VCs in Europe,\" Pierre says, adding: \"For our series B round, we pitched to 118 funds, and all of them said 'no.' We very close to going bankrupt, maybe a month away.\n\n\"All our competitors were huge. Two years ago, there was no way to convince investors that we'd really be competing face-to-face with Uber Eats or Deliveroo. There was very little conviction about food delivery back then.\n\nRead more: Amazon's new $2 billion startup Deliveroo wants to reduce cooking to being 'purely a hobby' over the next decade\n\n\"Being from Barcelona was always very tough because when you only operate in Spain, you don't have access to the VCs in London or in France. The Spanish ecosystem of VCs is very small and very risk-averse.\"\n\nIn 2017, Glovo raised $30 million in a series B funding round led by the Japanese tech giant Rakuten. Associated Press\n\nYet it ended up being a company with a famous connection to Barcelona that came to Glovo's aid. \"One day, Rakuten came out of the blue and decided to invest in us,\" Pierre recalls.\n\nThe Japanese e-commerce giant has served as shirt sponsor of FC Barcelona, the city's world-renowned soccer club, since 2016. Were Glovo's Barcelona roots what caught Rakuten's eye?\n\nRakuten is \"big in Barcelona,\" Pierre jokes. \"But, seriously, they had already invested in mobility a lot \u2014 in competitors to Uber\u2014 and they wanted to invest in delivery as well. So they picked us.\"\n\nTwo other funding rounds have followed, the latest of which, totaling 150 million euros, or $170 million, and led by the early Spotify investor Lakestar in April, took its total funding to $340 million. And those delivery rivals that once attracted all the funding at Glovo's expense? Well, the startup is beating them in certain markets.\n\nGlovo is winning the war with Uber and Deliveroo in some markets\n\nPierre says Amazon still has a \"startup mentality\" after 25 years. Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for WIRED25\n\n\"We've learned a lot from direct competitors,\" he says. \"For example, when we didn't know how to do food delivery, Deliveroo was already in Spain, and Deliveroo are very good operators.\n\n\"Eventually, we ended up beating them in both Italy and Spain. We've always had a mentality of learning from competitors as opposed to trashing them.\"\n\nHe adds that Amazon is a major influence. \"In terms of how they were able to start out with something so specific, how they've locked their users into something a lot bigger, how they still have a startup mentality after 25 years, it's crazy,\" he says.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Glovo is now in direct competition with the company Pierre admires after Amazon led a $575 million investment in Deliveroo last month, a deal that could see Amazon take a bigger step into the delivery market.\n\nA Deliveroo rider. Reuters\n\nSo where does Pierre see Glovo in 10 years? Does he aim to emulate Bezos and turn Glovo into an Amazon-style conglomerate?\n\n\"In the future, we'd like to go beyond delivery and look into things like reservations,\" he says. \"Not only restaurant reservations but also events, ticketing, going to the cinema, and maybe integrating with mobility services.\" Another space, he says, is home services, \"things like laundry, repairs, and cleaning services.\"\n\nThough Pierre acknowledges he worries about spreading Glovo too thin, he says its focus will remain narrower in the short to medium term, adding that Glovo is not yet looking to go public.\n\n\"We don't see ourselves going beyond being a super delivery app for the next few years,\" he says, adding: \"Our biggest focus at the moment is groceries, because they're the natural first step after food.\n\n\"For now, we're focusing on markets the big players aren't really looking at. Delivery is a global thing. It's not only for big, developed cities.\"", "description": "Oscar Pierre is the cofounder and CEO of Glovo, a Barcelona, Spain-based delivery app with a presence in 178 cities across 23 countries.", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d0a12cc638af21dbb1b4487-2560-1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-26"}
