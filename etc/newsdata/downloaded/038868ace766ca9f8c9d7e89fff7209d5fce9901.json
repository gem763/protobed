He recalls his first executive meeting at this office in October of 2009 \u2013 a year in which the company would ultimately lose $900,000 \u2013 being to discuss a proposal for making every role at OA part-time.\n\n\u201cThat would have been catastrophic. There was a lot of blame on the global financial crisis at the time, but the reality was the industry had been complacent for too long,\u201d he says. \u201cThe time of [supergroup] The Three Tenors, which gave opera a huge financial boost, had passed and there needed to be something new to excite people again.\u201d\n\nRing of truth\n\nTerracini, whose populist gestures while running the Brisbane Festival included bringing former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to town, immediately began working on three such excitements.\n\nFirst, he got OA to produce Wagner\u2019s mammoth, 15-hour The Ring Cycle for the first time, premiering it in Melbourne in 2013. \u201cAny opera company that purports to any kind of international reputation has to be doing The Ring,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat might have seemed liked madness for a cash-strapped company has, in a subsequent Sydney production with a third to follow in Brisbane next year, become something of a cash cow.\n\nSelling the vision\n\nTerracini\u2019s next vision back in 2009 \u2013 an opera staged on Sydney Harbour \u2013 required another big cheque-writer. He didn\u2019t even have an appointment to meet Japanese businessman and philanthropist Haruhisa Handa, but he flew to Tokyo anyway.\n\nOpera Australia staged La Traviata on Sydney Harbour in 2012; it's set for a return next year.\n\n\u201cI learnt from my festival days that if it\u2019s a good idea, you will get the money,\u201d Terracini says. \u201cI knew that Handa had studied opera in his youth and cared about connecting more people to the artform. We ended up getting twice as much as what I\u2019d told our chief financial officer we were aiming for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanda Opera On Sydney Harbour (HOSH) has been staged eight times, the season attracting about 50,000 people a year, three-quarters of whom have never attended an indoor opera. Terracini claims about a quarter of those people now go on to do so.\n\nTerracini\u2019s musical bid for the masses paid immediate dividends when 2014\u2019s The King & I saw OA\u2019s sales revenue jump 27 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe subscribers hated HOSH at first; it used amplification, it took resources from mainstage opera and so on, but now no one cares,\u201d Terracini says. \u201cPeople buy tickets to HOSH before they even know what\u2019s on, and it\u2019s helped us fund a lot of less-popular operas we\u2019d never have produced otherwise.\u201d\n\nBut Terracini\u2019s greatest and most controversial money spinner was his attempt to reach those resistant even to HOSH, by staging a musical each year. \u201cIf we\u2019re receiving money from the government \u2013 and that\u2019s where\n\n$26 million of the $115 million we turned over last year came from \u2013 then it\u2019s our duty to play to as many people as possible,\u201d he says.\n\nTerracini\u2019s musical bid for the masses paid immediate dividends when 2014\u2019s The King & I saw OA\u2019s sales revenue jump 27 per cent, as the Rodgers & Hammerstein chestnut broke box-office records at the Sydney Opera House.\n\nItalian Mezzo Soprano, Jos\u00e8 Maria Lo Monaco performed the role of Carmen for the 2017 Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour. James Brickwood\n\nIt\u2019s a record only bested since by OA\u2019s production of another musical, My Fair Lady directed by Dame Julie Andrews, which single-handedly saw the company through that otherwise lean 2017. However the move into musicals, to which trained operatic voices often aren\u2019t suited, initially meant a reduction in the number of traditional operas staged by OA.\n\nSomething had to give, and Terracini made what he admits has been the hardest decision of his tenure \u2013 moving the company\u2019s singers from full-time contracts onto performance-based fees.\n\nThe sacking of local singers caused an uproar, and by 2014 had nudged the opera-loving then-arts minister George Brandis into holding a national review of the artform. The review recommended that no government funding go into \u201csignificant commercial activities\u201d like HOSH or musicals, and that companies be fined $200,000 if they didn\u2019t cast local singers in at least 80 per cent of principal lead roles.\n\nMeanwhile, Terracini defends his heavy use of international singers, like superstar German tenor Jonas Kaufmann, as a way of funding the development of local talent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe response to Jonas, the best in the world at what he does, was absolutely euphoric when we had him here this year. He connects to people like Pavarotti used to and that\u2019s what we need to get people back to the opera,\u201d he says.\n\nTerracini sees the company\u2019s ability to keep performing the classic French, Italian and Mozartian operas at a world-class standard, and increasingly with Millennial-attracting digital technology, as the most important part of his legacy.\n\nLyndon Terracini who plays the mercenary in Paul Grabowsky's opera, The Mercenary.\n\n\u201cPeople say it\u2019s brave to do Ghost Sonata,\u201d he says, referring to the cerebral August Strindberg piece OA just staged for 1000-odd punters at its scenery workshop, starring former Wagga Wagga heavy metal singer Shanul Sharma. \u201cBut what\u2019s really brave is sticking to your guns and excelling at the core repertoire.\u201d\n\nAs for when the line will be ruled under that legacy, Terracini says he is \u201cin discussions\u201d with the board about his future after 2021. He won\u2019t elaborate, but judging from his comments to a Brisbane newspaper while contemplating his third festival there in 2006, it\u2019s a fair bet he\u2019ll have overseen his final Tosca before the decade is out.\n\n\u201cSome people are happy to stay for 20 years but, ultimately, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy for an organisation,\u201d he told the Courier-Mail at the time.\n\nTerracini\u2019s advice to his successor is to take things a little easier.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning I pushed too hard,\u201d says the man who admits to having no hobbies outside of work, and chats to patrons while attending OA performances most nights. \u201cAt a festival, you\u2019ve got a year to produce, but a major opera company is a big ship to turn around. It\u2019s only in the last couple of years that I feel we\u2019ve realised our potential \u2013 it took me 10 years to get to where I wanted to in five.\u201d", "description": "Artistic director Lyndon Terracini has kept Opera Australia on song financially but not everyone is a fan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1445%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_3441%2C$y_808/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/53fbe6121586800ef25012dc791da9524c343009", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
