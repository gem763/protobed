I like all people!). Hillary\u2019s gone Crazy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\nThe president\u2019s defense of Gabbard comes after Clinton smeared Gabbard in a recent interview as \u201cthe favorite of the Russians,\u201d who was being \u201cgroomed\u201d by the Kremlin as a potential third-party candidate.\n\nAppearing on a podcast hosted by David Plouffe, President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign manager, the failed presidential candidate claimed of the Hawaii Democrat:\n\n[Russia] has a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting [Gabbard] so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it.\n\nHours later, Gabbard \u2014 a combat military veteran and Army National Guard Major \u2014 slammed the Obama-era secretary of state in a series of tweets, calling her the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d and accused her of being behind a New York Times hit piece published prior to Tuesday evening\u2019s Democrat presidential debate:\n\n\u2026 concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and \u2026 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n\u2026 powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nOf the entire 2020 Democrat primary field, only technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang and new age author Marianne Williamson defended Gabbard against Clinton\u2019s loaded accusations.\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard deserves much more respect and thanks than this. She literally just got back from serving our country abroad,\u201d tweeted Yang.\n\nWilliamson wrote: \u201cThe Democratic establishment has got to stop smearing women it finds inconvenient!
