Even where people are not protesting, they are hurting and want to be heard.\"\n\nGuterres said people want their human rights respected, including the right to have a say in the decision-making process.\n\n191025190848575\n\n\"[People] want a level playing field - including social, economic and financial systems that work for all.\"\n\nThe secretary-general reiterated his deep concern that some protests have turned violent and led to the loss of life, stressing that governments are obligated to uphold freedom of expression and assembly and \"security forces must act with maximum restraint, in conformity with international law\".\n\n\"There can be no excuse for violence - from any quarter,\" he said.\n\nIn response to a question about deadly protests in Iraq, Guterres said the UN has been \"systematically appealing for non-violence and for restraint\" by Iraqi authorities and other actors.\n\nHe pointed to recent UN preliminary findings which showed \"substantial violations of human rights that took place and need to be clearly denounced and condemned\".\n\nAs for protests in Lebanon, he said, his message is that the country must solve its problems with dialogue.\n\n\"I urge maximum restraint and no use of violence, both from the side of the government and the side of the protesters,\" he said.", "description": "UN chief tells reporters there is a growing threat to public order because of trust deficit between leaders and people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/24/5fa920a99635417da48dd7d238dfe024_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
