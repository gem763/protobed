And so the racists quieten down \u2013 for a bit. Some of them clear off. But soon there are enough of them at it again.\n\nThe intimidation continues, along with the unspoken threat that this is exactly how they will behave tomorrow, and the next day, and whenever else they fancy.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFor when has a bully ever stopped voluntarily?\n\nI don\u2019t know a single parent who wouldn\u2019t give their child in that situation just one piece of advice: \u201cGet the hell out of there straight away. You don\u2019t have to listen to that. And don\u2019t go back until the bosses have stopped it.\u201d\n\nAnd there is absolutely no difference to that and what our England team withstood on Monday night.\n\nA football stadium is the factory floor for Tyrone Mings and Marcus Rashford.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no reason why \u2013 just because they\u2019re paid to entertain people \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t be protected in the same way as someone paid to assemble cars or file insurance claims.\n\nAnd yet UEFA \u2013 the bosses of European football \u2013 has time and again failed to protect its workers.\n\nEveryone knew racist incidents were likely at the Bulgaria game, and yet dozens of thugs still got into the ground \u2013 many wearing \u201cNo Respect\u201d tops as a two-finger salute to the Respect banners draped ineffectively around the stadium. The England players \u2013 and fans \u2013 behaved brilliantly.\n\nAnd the stopping of the match twice showed these players are no longer prepared to carry on and pretend to ignore abuse as they\u2019ve done so many times before. A line has been crossed.\n\nAnd yet...\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAnd yet they still played on through the second half when abuse continued. They still completed a match which should have been abandoned long before.\n\nAnd why should anyone watching \u2013 either in the stadium or at home \u2013 have to witness it too? Why should any parent in front of the TV have had to explain to their football fanatical child why that chanting was going on \u2013 and why no one was making it stop?\n\nAnd why does UEFA talk about zero-tolerance for racism when in actual fact it\u2019s three-chances-and-we\u2019ll-hope-no-one-hears-anything-after-the-second-warning tolerance? Only when a team of players walk together off a pitch will those who run football finally root this out.\n\nIf UEFA were guided by morality, it would have done it years ago. Financial penalties and global shame are the only levers our players have left. They must use them.\n\nAnd we mustn\u2019t kid ourselves that this is a \u201cforeign\u201d problem. There have been way too many incidents of racism at our own grounds recently.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nInevitably, what happens at international and national games is copied at lower league games, at Sunday league matches, at under-10s park football, and at kids lobbing rolled-up socks down the street.\n\nSo how England\u2019s youngsters were treated on Monday night really is how any of our youngsters will be treated \u2013 if we allow it.\n\nIt\u2019s time we told all our kids: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to get the hell out of there. You don\u2019t have to listen to that.\u201d", "description": "Mirror columnist Alison Phillips on why England match against Bulgaria should have been abandoned after racist chants", "authors": ["Alison Phillips", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20585025.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Prod-Tyrone-Mings.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
