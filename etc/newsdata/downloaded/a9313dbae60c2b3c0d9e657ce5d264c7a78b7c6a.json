Circling within the lights can exhaust the birds and potentially lead to their demise, he noted.\n\n\"We know it's a sensitive issue,\" he said, adding that NYC Audubon has worked for years with the 9/11 Memorial & Museum and the Municipal Art Society of New York, which created the exhibit, to balance protecting the birds while providing the temporary memorial.\n\nThe lights also attract bats and birds of prey, including nighthawks and peregrine falcons, who feed on small birds and millions of insects drawn to the lights, The New York Times reported on Tuesday.\n\nA 2017 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, found the Tribute in Light affected 1.1 million migrating birds observed by scientists during the annual exhibit between 2008 and 2016, or about 160,000 birds a year.\n\nQin Lang/Xinhua via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"Nocturnally migrating birds are particularly susceptible to artificial light because of adaptations and requirements for navigating and orienting in darkness,\" according to the study by researchers from NYC Audubon, Oxford University and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.\n\nThe seven-year study found that while the urban light installation \"altered multiple behaviors of nocturnally migrating birds,\" it also discovered that the birds disperse and return to their migratory patterns when the lights are turned off.\n\nEvery year, a team of volunteers from NYC Audubon monitor the birds circling in the beams and when the number reaches 1,000, volunteers ask that the lights be turned off for about 20 minutes to free the birds from the seemingly magnetic hold of the lights.\n\nCarol Guzy/The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\n\nWhile the Tribute in Light is a temporary hazard to migrating birds, skyscrapers with reflective windows are a permanent threat to feathered flocks that fly around New York City.\n\nBird-safe Building Legislation is gaining momentum!
