In my very first election I remember writing \"I will always be a person first and a politician second\" - I want to stay that way.\n\n\"So I have reluctantly come to the decision that I will not re-stand when the next general election comes.\"\n\nShe said she would step down whatever happens in tonight's vote on holding a Christmas election.\n\nHer statement was published within hours of Jeremy Corbyn announcing Labour would back a vote on holding a snap poll in December.", "description": "The former Tory said she has become \"exhausted\" at the \"nastiness and intimidation\" in British politics", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Chris Mcandrew", "Uk Parliament", "Attribution Unported", "Cc", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749321.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_irqMbhPba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
