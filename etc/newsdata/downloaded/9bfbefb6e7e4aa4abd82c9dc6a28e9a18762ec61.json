We\u2019re improving and we\u2019re learning,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked ahead of the hearing if he would resign, Muilenburg said that was \u201cnot where my focus is.\u201d He also declined to say if he or the board were considering his resignation after the plane returns to service.\n\nBoeing ran full-page advertisements in major newspapers expressing condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed in the crashes on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThese two accidents occurred on my watch and I have a keen sense of responsibility,\u201d Muilenburg, who was stripped of his title as Boeing chairman by the board earlier this month, told reporters.\n\nFamily members, holding photos of victims of the crash, were seated just three rows behind Muilenburg during his testimony.\n\nFor months, Boeing had largely not acknowledged blame and, instead, vowed to make a \u201csafe plane safer.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s hearing represents Boeing\u2019s broadest acceptance of responsibility that it made mistakes, though Muilenburg\u2019s written testimony ahead of the hearing did not describe in detail what those mistakes were.\n\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg arrives to testify before a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing on \u201caviation safety\u201d and the grounded 737 MAX after two deadly 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 29, 2019. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nSenator Roger Wicker, the committee chairman, addressed families of the crash victims: \u201cI promise to their loved ones that we will find out what went wrong and work to prevent future tragedies.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Muilenburg visited the Indonesian Embassy in Washington to meet with the ambassador and \u201cpay our respects to those lost aboard Lion Air flight 610 on the first anniversary of the accident,\u201d Boeing said in a statement.\n\nMuilenburg will also testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Wednesday.\n\nMichael Stumo, the father of Samya Rose Stumo, who died in the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash in March, said on Monday the victims\u2019 families would hold up photos of the \u201cloved ones we lost\u201d to \u201cmake sure the focus is on that, rather than political or bureaucratic or engineering issues.\u201d\n\nHe questioned why Boeing was only now adding safeguards to a flight control system known as MCAS that investigators have linked to both crashes.\n\n\u201cWhen you knew the MCAS system was part of that Lion Air crash, why didn\u2019t you act to correct it immediately instead of still withholding information about it and blaming the pilots?\u201d Stumo said of Boeing.\n\nU.S. airlines have cancelled flights into January and February because of the grounding, and the Federal Aviation Administration is not expected to approve the 737 MAX\u2019s ungrounding until December at the earliest.\n\nIn March, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the plane was grounded worldwide.\n\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg testifies before a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing on \u201caviation safety\u201d and the grounded 737 MAX after two deadly 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 29, 2019. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nIndonesian investigators reported on Friday that Boeing, acting without adequate oversight from U.S. regulators, failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on the 737 MAX, sowing the seeds for the Oct. 29, 2018, Lion Air 610 crash, which also involved errors by airline workers and crew.\n\nMuilenburg added that \u201cregulators should approve the return of the MAX to the skies only after they have applied the most rigorous scrutiny, and are completely satisfied as to the plane\u2019s safety. The flying public deserves nothing less.\u201d", "description": "Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, at the start of two days of testimony before U.S. lawmakers, faced tough questions on Tuesday on the crashes of two 737 MAX planes that killed 346 people and sparked calls for reforms.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446206296&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S16P", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
