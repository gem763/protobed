I am so excited about this initiative to \u2018lock the door open\u2019 for libra tech.\u201d\n\nA more trustworthy environment for Libra apps\n\nOpenLibra\u2019s developers have already released the first version of a permissionless Libra-based virtual machine on GitHub \u2014 dubbed MoveMint \u2014 that will run on top of the Tendermint blockchain software.\n\nAccording to the project\u2019s official website, OpenLibra aims to become \u201can alternative to Facebook's Libra, that places emphasis on open governance and economic decentralization.\u201d The site explains:\n\n\u201cDespite pushback from nation-states, we believe that Facebook is likely to succeed in their goal. OECD Governments will be focused on their own outcomes, and in reality have little legislative power to leverage against a transnational force such as Facebook's Libra. For that reason we are creating OpenLibra.\u201d\n\nOpenLibra\u2019s core team and contributors list includes personalities from projects such as Cosmos, Wireline, Radicle, Democracy Earth, BlockScience, Synestate, Vulcanize, MathShop, Web3, Singapore University, Ethereum Foundation, Spacemesh, George Mason University, Iclusion, Hashed, Danish Red Cross and Kyokan.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Oct. 8, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of blockchain payments network Ripple, thinks that Facebook will fail to launch its Libra digital currency before 2023.", "description": "OpenLibra, a permissionless fork of Facebook\u2019s stablecoin Libra, is announced at the Ethereum developer conference Devcon 5", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNzU5NDAzOGRiYmU0NjQ3ODY2NjI2N2YxMzIzZTIwYzUuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
