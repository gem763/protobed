In her place, Yves Maitre stepped into the role of Chief Executive, after more than a decade at French telecom giant, Orange.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough job at an even tougher time. The move comes on the tail of five consecutive quarterly losses and major layoffs, including a quarter of the company\u2019s staff, which were let go in July of last year.\n\nIt\u2019s a far fall for a company that comprised roughly 11 percent of global smartphone sales, some eight years ago.
