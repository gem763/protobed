(Photo: Samir Hussein/ WireImage)\n\nPrince William and Duchess Kate of Cambridge arrived in Pakistan late Monday for a five-day official visit described as their \"most complex\" ever due to major logistical and security issues in a diplomatically touchy region.\n\nThey did not take their three children, Prince George, 6, Princess Charlotte, 4, or Prince Louis, 1, with them.\n\nThe couple landed at a Pakistani air force base in Rawalpindi just before 10 p.m. local time, according to video posted on Twitter.\n\nKate was wearing a traditional shalwar kameez, an ombr\u00e9 turquoise dress and pants by Catherine Walker, plus cream-colored high heels.\n\nDuchess Kate of Cambridge at Pakistani Air Force Base Nur Khan on Oct. 14, 2019, in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

Among others, they will meet with Prime Minister Imran Kahn, the former cricket superstar-turned-politician who was a friend of Will's late mother, Princess Diana.\n\n\"This is the most complex tour undertaken by (the duke and duchess) to date, given the logistical and security considerations,\" according to a Kensington Palace statement issued in advance of the trip. \"Pakistan hosts one of Britain\u2019s largest overseas networks, with the British High Commission in Islamabad being one of the United Kingdom's largest diplomatic missions in the world.\"\n\nIndeed, the young royals, both 37, are arriving in a part of the world already on edge due to soaring tensions in the long-tense relationship between India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed countries. A scientific study released Oct. 2 concluded that as many as 125 million people would die within days if India and Pakistan waged a nuclear war.\n\nPrince William and Duchess Kate of Cambridge at the naming ceremony of the UK\u2019s new polar research ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, Birkenhead, England, Sept. 26, 2019.

In fact, Pakistan was the destination of her first official solo royal trip, in 1991.\n\nShe also made a private two-day visit to Lahore in 1996 to see her friends, Khan and his then-wife, Jemima Goldsmith, and in 1997 to open a cancer hospital with the Khans.\n\nAt least one Pakistani on Twitter spotted some interest in the royal visit.\n\n\"Looks like Pakistan is ready for #RoyalVisitPakistan Spotted this in #Rawalpindi a few hours ago,\" posted Shahrukh over a picture of a neon-lit sign with the Pakistani and British flags.\n\nAt the time the Cambridge trip was announced in June, the High Commissioner for Pakistan to the United Kingdom, Mohammad Nafees Zakaria, said Pakistanis will \"warmly welcome\" the royal couple, noting that people there still fondly recall the visits of William's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, in 1961 and 1997.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming royal visit is a reflection of the importance the United Kingdom attaches to its relations with Pakistan,\" Zakaria said. \"The two countries enjoy historical links which both sides wish to strengthen further.\u201d\n\nPrincess Diana attends a dinner in Islamabad, Pakistan, during her first official solo visit as a royal in September 1991.

Two weeks ago, they went to a special event hosted by Prince Shah Karim Al Hussaini, Aga Khan IV, at his Aga Khan Centre in London, to get a taste of modern Pakistani culture and to meet a range of Pakistanis in Britain, including musicians, chefs and artists within the Pakistani diaspora community.\n\nEver attuned to the sensibilities of her hosts, Kate wore a flowing floor-length emerald green silk dress (the Pakistani flag is green with a white crescent moon and star in the center) by ARoss Girl x Soler.\n\nThe overarching themes of the Pakistan trip in some ways echo those of the Sussex Africa tour: Access to quality education, empowerment for girls and young women, conservation, and communities' efforts to respond and adapt to climate change.\n\nPrincess Diana cradles a sick child during a visit to a cancer hospital founded by her friend, Pakistani cricket star-turned Prime Minister Imran Khan, in Lahore on Feb. 22, 1996. (Photo: John Giles/ AP)\n\nThey also will spend time exploring the complex security picture in Pakistan, meeting with British and Pakistan military personnel who are sharing expertise to improve security.\n\nAs usual with their previous overseas visits (all of which were smashing successes), Will and Kate want to meet as many Pakistanis as possible, including children and youths, government and business leaders, charity activists, conservationists, and famous cultural figures and sports stars.\n\n\"The U.K.\u2019s links with Pakistan are extensive, and Their Royal Highnesses are looking forward to building a lasting friendship with the people of Pakistan,\" the Kensington Palace statement said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/14/prince-william-kate-pakistan-most-complex-tour-ever/3909246002/", "description": "Prince William and Duchess Kate are touring Pakistan, a country close to his late mother, Princess Diana, who made three visits there before she died.", "authors": ["Maria Puente", "Published P.M.
