With just over a year until the election, it\u2019s far from clear that the candidates are.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to precisely assess the presidential candidates\u2019 preparedness, because they\u2019re divulging few details about the precautions they\u2019re taking. When The Atlantic contacted representatives of Trump\u2019s campaign and the top 10 Democratic campaigns, many officials declined to comment on their approach to digital security on the grounds that revealing the measures would render them less effective. \u201cWe take cybersecurity very seriously and we do not comment on our preparations,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for the president\u2019s reelection campaign, told The Atlantic in an emblematic response.\n\nRead: Computer scientists make the case against an expensive new voting system\n\nA few candidates offered some details. Ian Sams, the press secretary for Kamala Harris, told The Atlantic that the campaign is mandating that all staff use encrypted messaging services and two-factor authentication to access accounts. A spokesperson for Beto O\u2019Rourke said the campaign trains staff on defending against cyberattacks as part of its onboarding process, requires staffers to protect mobile devices with complex passwords, and uses secure messaging channels. The Biden campaign has a chief technology officer, and Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign recently became the first to publicize that it had hired a chief information-security officer.\n\nJoel Wallenstrom, the CEO of Wickr, which along with Signal has become a popular encrypted messaging app for political campaigns, told me his service hasn\u2019t replaced email for these campaigns but is being employed as a dedicated channel for sharing sensitive information, such as polling data and opposition research. This not only shelters the material, he said, but also makes it more difficult for adversaries to bait campaign staff with these documents through other channels like email without raising suspicions.\n\nNevertheless, Agari has found that only four of the 13 presidential candidates polling at 1 percent or above\u2014Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Tulsi Gabbard\u2014have implemented a policy that in its estimation would prevent emails spoofing their campaign-site domains from reaching the inboxes of voters, donors, reporters, or other recipients. As a point of comparison, the Department of Homeland Security now requires all federal agencies to aim for adopting this level of protection against email-spoofing.", "description": "A repeat of the hack targeting John Podesta could well happen again.", "authors": ["Uri Friedman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX6EXXE/facebook.jpg?1567630311", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
