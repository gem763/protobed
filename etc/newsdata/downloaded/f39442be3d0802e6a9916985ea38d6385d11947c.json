Night Shyamalan could never. Photo: DreamWorks\n\nWhen I was 10 years old, my dad showed me The Shining, which in some states would probably be considered reckless endangerment. I loved it, even as I could feel it permanently altering the wiring of my brain. I\u2019ve since spent the past two decades trying to re-create that experience \u2014 i.e., find a movie so perfectly terrifying that it low-key destroys my life and completely ravages my worldview. (Thank you, yes, I am in therapy.) I\u2019ve seen a lot of good horror movies over the years (The Descent, Goodnight Mommy, It Follows, Let the Right One In, and Hereditary are some of my favorites), but the hours upon hours of horror-viewing have mostly just served to slowly erode my pleasure centers and turn me into the kind of person who can watch The Strangers alone in my house in the bathtub and then get a great night\u2019s sleep.\n\nThere is, however, one exception, one film that can still reach the recesses of my dilapidated brain. It is the scariest movie I have ever seen. It provides me with nightmare fuel to this day. Even thinking of it on a warm summer\u2019s eve, I shudder, chilled to the bone, pulling my floral cardigan tightly around my shoulders, wondering if that long shadow on the driveway is just my imagination. This film is Revolutionary Road, which came out on Christmas 2008, and was billed, incredibly, as a \u201cromance.\u201d\n\nThe first time I saw Revolutionary Road, I was on winter break from college, and my mom and I went to a nice afternoon screening, just two gals excited to watch Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet reunited for the first time since Titanic. Before the film ended, I was out in the hallway, experiencing my very first panic attack. Last night, I rewatched it for the first time since that fateful afternoon, and I immediately picked a fight with my boyfriend about whether or not we should subscribe to the Criterion Channel. \u201cI guess we will have a life devoid of art and culture and history,\u201d I said, smoking 12 cigarettes at once as I sewed myself an apron with my other hand. My point is, this movie ruins lives.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with Revolutionary Road, let\u2019s unpack it together because you absolutely should not watch it unless you want to obliterate any remaining sense of joy (or unless it\u2019s Halloween and you want to watch a horror movie, in which case, this is the only one). Based on Richard Yates\u2019s 1961 novel of the same name and directed by Sam Mendes, the movie follows the downward trajectory of 1950s East Coast couple April (Kate Winslet) and Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio). April, an aspiring actress, and Frank, a longshoreman, meet at a party, locking eyes from across the room, and begin sexily dancing. Oh, wow, you might think during this scene. It\u2019s like Titanic, but if Rose had just scooched over and let Jack onto the door and they were able to live a lovely life together and flirt at parties. I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but actually, it is like Titanic, except only in the sense that it is a film primarily marked by sheer misery until one of them dies and it\u2019s basically the other one\u2019s fault.\n\nBefore the opening credits even conclude, Kate and Leo are living in the Connecticut suburbs with two kids and a \u201cmodern\u201d house on a street called \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Revolutionary Road. Everything is beige. Everyone\u2019s pants are beige, everyone\u2019s hair is beige (except for Kate Winslet, who gets to be icy blonde to convey that she is different), everyone\u2019s beach umbrellas are beige, everyone\u2019s carpet is beige, everyone\u2019s couch is beige, everyone\u2019s soul is beige. Kate has just bombed spectacularly as the lead in the town\u2019s play, and Leo is like, \u201cYeah, that actually did suck.\u201d To add insult to injury, Kathy Bates is their Realtor, which means this is truly a diabolical reanimation of the entire cast of Titanic, transplanting them all to a scenario that is somehow shittier than a gigantic sinking boat.\n\nWithin the film\u2019s first five minutes, Kate and Leo are screaming at each other inside their car and then on the side of the road, which, again, is basically like spraying poorly done graffiti onto the historical landmark that is Titanic\u2019s car sex scene. The scene is meant to indicate how bone-deep depressed they both are. Kate tells Leo he\u2019s a \u201cpathetic, self-deluded little boy\u201d who \u201chas me in a trap\u201d; Leo calls her \u201csick\u201d; she calls him \u201cdisgusting.\u201d He punches their car on the head. They go home. Nobody draws anybody like one of their French girls.\n\nWe\u2019re then introduced to their daily routines: Frank heads to work in a sea of men dressed in the exact same oversize gray suit and stupid gray hat. April is taking out the trash and doing the laundry in her apron, looking forlornly out her picture window onto the crabgrass. Sometimes Kathy Bates bursts in with a patch of some other grass to put on the crabgrass and she and Kate sit and stare at each other in silence. If you, for example, are watching this next to your mom in suburban Chicago in the middle of a gigantic multilevel movie theater inside a shopping mall in the mid-aughts, you begin to feel the stirrings of a panic attack.\n\nThe most frightening parts of Revolutionary Road center on the idea that Kate and Leo believe that they\u2019re somehow \u201cspecial\u201d \u2014 that even though they live in the suburbs and have kids and do laundry and stare at grass and fuck their secretaries after lunchtime Martinis, they\u2019re better than their neighbors, and are living this life from an ironic distance. They don\u2019t want this life; they\u2019re living it almost by accident. They repeat this idea to each other over and over again, and even Kathy Bates is like, \u201cYou guys aren\u2019t like my other clients. You\u2019re special.\u201d But not special enough to avoid the cruel banality and homogeneity of 1950s suburbia. Both Kate and Leo yearn to break free of their claustrophobic existence (\u201cWe\u2019ve resigned to the ridiculous idea that you have to settle down once you have children!\u201d says Kate, desperate for a change) and for a brief period in the middle of the movie, they decide to, planning to move their family to Paris so Leo can figure out what he wants to do with his life.\n\nFor a few scenes, things begin to look up: Leo decides to quit his job at the whatever factory, Kate wears a jaunty ponytail as she packs up their house, and everyone around them is bewildered and secretly jealous that they seem to have figured out how to escape the doldrums. This is truly the meanest part of the movie because you know these mofos aren\u2019t moving to Paris, you just don\u2019t know why.\n\nIn the midst of the Paris planning, Kathy Bates brings her son Michael Shannon over for lunch, explaining that he\u2019s on a brief recess from a stay in the local mental hospital and she thought Leo and Kate might cheer him up. It turns out that Michael Shannon\u2019s \u201cinsanity\u201d is really just a propensity for telling the truth, and since he\u2019s the only other person in this movie who\u2019s willing to admit that the 1950s suburbs suck, he and Kate and Leo get along famously, laughing deliriously about the empty hopelessness of their lives and strolling around in the woods.\n\nIt is statistically impossible for Kate and Leo to have sex onscreen without instant chaos ensuing, and this film is no exception. Kate and Leo fuck against a kitchen cabinet in the heat of their Paris delusion, Kate gets pregnant shortly thereafter, and when she calmly suggests an abortion, Leo goes ballistic. (At this point in the movie, my boyfriend turns to me and says, \u201cIt feels like this movie was made specifically to antagonize you.\u201d) Eventually, Leo gets a promotion at the whatever factory and decides that he won\u2019t quit his job and they\u2019ll stay and rot in suburban Connecticut. \u201cIt is possible that Parisians aren\u2019t the only ones capable of leading interesting lives,\u201d he says, wearing beige at the beige beach.\n\nThings go aggressively downhill from here. Kate is like, \u201cI don\u2019t want another baby; the first baby was a mistake and we only had a second baby so we could tell ourselves that the first baby wasn\u2019t a mistake.\u201d Leo is like, \u201cYou are hysterical. We need to find you a doctor to help you make sense of your life!!!\u201d Kate promptly bones the sheriff from Stranger Things. \u201cMarried, two kids. Should be enough,\u201d she says to him before they have sex in a car (again \u2026 this Titanic slander!). \u201cIt is for him. He\u2019s right. We were never special or destined for anything at all.\u201d\n\nSoon, Kate is peeling potatoes in a housedress and Leo is having sex with Zoe Kazan and I am losing it. There is nothing more horrifying than watching Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater making it off the boat only to live a life of blunt sorrow in a beige house, making beige potatoes in a beige bowl. Leo comes home to Mrs. Potatohead and tells her that he\u2019s been cheating on her, but it\u2019s over. She says she doesn\u2019t care and doesn\u2019t love him anymore. Michael Shannon stops by again, and when he finds out they\u2019re not moving to Paris anymore, he\u2019s furious. \u201cLittle woman decides she\u2019s not ready to stop playing house?\u201d he screams, his face reddening as he turns to Leo. \u201cYou figure it\u2019s more comfy here in the old hopeless emptiness after all, huh? \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he knocked her up on purpose just so he could spend the rest of his life hiding behind a maternity dress. That way he\u2019d never have to find out what he\u2019s made of.\u201d (I begin Googling \u201cflights to Paris leaving right now with no return flight.\u201d)\n\nLeo and Kate have another knockdown brawl, ending with Kate running into the woods and leaning against several trees for roughly eight hours straight. Leo spends the night alone in a dark house, confronting the innate chaos of the universe and that feeling when you don\u2019t eat dinner and fall asleep really early by accident and then you wake up and you\u2019re like, Where am I? Who am I? Is there such a thing as the self or is it just a series of habits we\u2019ve constructed to distract ourselves from the wilderness of the human condition?\n\nWhen Kate returns, she\u2019s entered the Uncanny Valley of 1950s Housewives. Hair done, makeup on, she makes Leo a full breakfast: scrambled eggs, half a grapefruit, coffee, toast. She sits across from him, smiling vacantly. Both disappear near seamlessly into their prescribed roles. \u201cTell me about your new job,\u201d she says. Leo draws a computer on a napkin as he explains how he\u2019s going to sell them. \u201cI see,\u201d Kate says, eyes black and empty. \u201cAt least, I think I see.\u201d Leo leaves for the day, his eyes watering with joy. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve ever had a nicer breakfast,\u201d he says. It is the most chilling scene I\u2019ve ever seen on film. Watching it, I feel like I need an exorcist. And it only gets darker: The moment Leo leaves, Kate gives herself a vacuum aspiration abortion, bleeds bright red onto the beige carpet, and dies.\n\nThe film ends as the neighborhood digests the news of Kate and Leo\u2019s fate. Kathy Bates tells her husband that Leo lives in the city now with his kids, a broken husk of a man, and the new couple moving into the Wheelers\u2019 house is really the \u201conly couple who\u2019s ever been right for the house.\u201d Her husband studies her. \u201cWhat about the Wheelers?\u201d he asks. She launches into a well-rehearsed diatribe, explaining how Kate and Leo were \u201ctoo whimsical\u201d and \u201callowed the house to depreciate.\u201d Her husband stares blankly at her as he slowly turns off his hearing aid \u2014 the point, of course, being that everyone secretly hates the person they\u2019re supposed to love and life is one long slog into an inescapable existential beige hell.\n\nBack in the year 2008, I am weeping in a movie-theater bathroom, a broken husk of a woman. My mom comes into the bathroom and laughs. \u201cRachel,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to live in the suburbs.\u201d", "description": "This Halloween, treat yourself to some searing suburban ennui, courtesy of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.", "authors": ["Rachel Handler"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/28/28-revolutionary-road-winslet-dicaprio.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
