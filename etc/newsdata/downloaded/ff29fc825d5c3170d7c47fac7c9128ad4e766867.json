With this in mind, here are our top five equity release myth busters, to give you a better idea of what's really on offer.\n\nRates are lower than ever\n\nEquity release is currently more popular than ever - Equity Release Council research recently revealed that some \u00a31.8billion in housing wealth was unlocked via equity release in the first half of the year.\n\nAs more homeowners have taken the product, lenders have innovated, with ERC research showing there are now twice as many deals on offer as last year.\n\nThis increased competition and appetite to lend has pushed down rates to historic lows, with the average rate now sitting at 4.91 per cent, and some deals even available below 3 per cent.\n\nThere are currently more equity release deals to choose from than ever before\n\nDepending on your circumstances, shopping around can find you an equity release deal with a rate akin to ordinary mortgage rates.\n\nAnd because you have the option to not pay the interest each month like you would with a mortgage, you won't need to worry about passing lenders' affordability tests.\n\nDrawdown options let you take a regular income\n\nThe main form of equity release which most people take is called a lifetime mortgage, and with this you usually have the option to take the money all at once or to take it on a drawdown basis - as and when you need it.\n\nThis means you take an initial lump sum at the start and then take further withdrawals at a later stage.\n\nThere is also the option to top up your monthly income by using this drawdown facility to release money each month.\n\nThis can help supplement your income, giving you a guaranteed amount each month for a set period of time.\n\nThe advantage of this is that interest accrues only on what you have already taken, so you aren't charged for the money that you don\u2019t need right away. This can help to control the interest build-up on your loan.\n\nRingfence your inheritance\n\nOne of the concerns people have when considering equity release is how it will affect the inheritance they are able to leave behind when they pass on.\n\nIt\u2019s true that equity release can eat into an inheritance, but you can also ringfence a portion of the equity in your property so that it's protected. This is known as an \u2018inheritance protection guarantee\u2019.\n\nFor example, if a couple was eligible to release \u00a360,000, but wanted to make sure that their children would receive some money after they died, they could release \u00a330,000 and leave the other \u00a330,000 protected.\n\nReleasing additional equity further down the road can affect this however, and it isn\u2019t available on all deals.\n\nYou can ring fence part of your property's equity so that it is protected from interest roll-up\n\nNo negative equity guarantee\n\nAs there are usually no monthly repayments with equity release, the interest rolls up and compounds until the property is sold.\n\nThis is usually when the homeowner dies or moves into long-term care. When this happens, the provider will reclaim the loan as well as all the interest that has rolled up.\n\nMost equity release loans now carry a no negative equity guarantee.\n\nThis means that when your property is sold, and agents\u2019 and solicitors\u2019 fees have been paid, even if the amount left is not enough to repay the outstanding loan to your provider, neither you nor your estate will be liable to pay any more.\n\nAll members of the Equity Release Council are signed up to this commitment, so check that your provider is a member.\n\nRefinance options are available\n\nYour financial situation is not set in stone once you\u2019ve taken an equity release deal and refinancing options exist, but this is unknown to most.\n\nIt will, however, depend on your balance of equity in the home, and whether there are any early repayment charges on your loan.\n\nSome plans have what are known as 'gilt-based early repayment charges', which link the level of penalty to government bonds.\n\nOther plans charge a fixed fee, which is calculated as a percentage of the loan, but these often reduce over time.\n\nBorrowers who took out plans when rates were higher are likely to benefit\n\nSpeaking to a good adviser will be able to help here - but just because you've already taken a deal doesn't mean you will have to stay on the same rate, and the same terms, forever.", "description": "Homeowners are turning to equity release in ever greater numbers but many are still unsure of how equity release works, so we've put together our top five equity release facts.", "authors": ["This Is Money Reporter", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
