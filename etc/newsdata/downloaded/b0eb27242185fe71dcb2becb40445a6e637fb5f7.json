He did not specify which lobby groups.\n\nAberdeen Standard Investments, part of Standard Life Aberdeen , is a top-five shareholder according to Refinitiv data.\n\nShareholders are intensifying pressure on resource companies because of the urgency of preventing potentially catastrophic climate change. But in Australia, where many of dual-listed BHP's shareholders are based, there is strong support for coal as a historic provider of jobs and wealth.\n\nIndustry groups such as Minerals Council of Australia have repeatedly called for coal friendly policies.\n\nBHP, whose income derives primarily from iron ore and coking coal, used to make steel, says it is committed to cutting emissions and making mining sustainable.\n\nIt also said it is reviewing its membership of industry groups and has withdrawn from some of them, but believes engagement can promote best practice. on Wednesday, the Church of England Pensions Board, which manages the retirement funds of clergy and other staff, said investors representing more than 2.1 trillion pounds ($2.57 trillion) of assets under management had indicated they would support a resolution on lobbying.\n\nThe resolution, first made public in September, recommends \"membership of industry associations be suspended where their advocacy demonstrates overall inconsistency with the Paris Agreement's goals\".\n\nThe international agreement in 2015 aims to restrict global warming and the resolution's authors say lobbying for the use of coal is inconsistent with this.\n\nThe pensions board said proxy voting advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis, who guide institutional investors, had not recommended its clients support the resolution and called for a meeting with them and the investors to discuss the issue.\n\n\"Any investor that determines the quality of a proxy advisor's advice based solely on whether one is 'for' or 'against' a proposal, with no regard for the extensive analysis, reasoning, expertise and engagement that such advisors conduct on behalf of their clients, raises serious concerns about their ability to meet their own regulatory and fiduciary duties,\u201d said Aaron Bertinetti, Glass Lewis' senior vice president, research and engagement, in response.\n\nClimate change was \"a very serious and material issue\", but not the only issue that needed to be considered, he added.\n\nISS declined to comment.\n\nLast month, BHP said its board would recommend shareholders oppose the resolution at its annual general meetings in London next week and in Sydney on Nov. 7.
