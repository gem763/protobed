Now let\u2019s look at comments by Schiff, who is heading the impeachment inquiry, as reporters probed about the whistleblower before the details of the allegation were revealed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSchiff\u2019s answers are especially interesting in the wake of reports in the New York Times and The Washington Post that the whistleblower approached a House Intelligence Committee staff member for guidance before filing a complaint with the Intelligence Community inspector general. The staff member learned the \u201cvery bare contours\u201d of the allegation that Trump has abused the powers of his office, The Post said.\n\nWhen the Fact Checker asked what \u201cbare contours\u201d meant, a committee spokesman pointed to an exchange of letters. In a Sept. 13 letter to the committee, the general counsel of the director of national intelligence said that \u201ccomplaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community.\u201d In his own letter that day, Schiff wrote that because of that language, and because the DNI refused to affirm or deny that White House officials were involved in the decision not to forward the complaint, the committee can conclude only that \u201cthe serious misconduct involves the president of the United States and/or other senior White House or administration officials.\u201d\n\nOur suspicion is that the unidentified staff member learned the potential complaint involved \u201cprivileged\u201d communication, which is code for something having to do with the president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, with this new information, let\u2019s look back at how Schiff handled questions about his knowledge of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe Facts\n\nSept. 16, interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN\n\nCooper: \u201cJust to be clear, you don\u2019t know who this alleged whistleblower is or what they are alleging?\u201d Schiff: \u201cI don\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower.\u201d Cooper: \u201cAnd they haven\u2019t contacted you or their legal representation hasn\u2019t contacted you?\u201d Schiff: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into any particulars. I want to make sure that there\u2019s nothing that I do that jeopardizes the whistleblower in any way.\u201d\n\nThis is a classic dodge \u2014 \u201cdon\u2019t want to get into any particulars\u201d \u2014 and Cooper failed to follow up. Notice how Schiff quickly answered whether he knew the identity of the whistleblower \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d \u2014 but then sidestepped the questions about whether the committee had been contacted. But in doing so, he managed not to mislead; he just simply did not answer the question.\n\nSept. 17, interview on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d\n\nSam Stein: \u201cHave you heard from the whistleblower? Do you want to hear from the whistleblower? What protections could you provide to the whistleblower?\u201d \u2026 Schiff: \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to. But I am sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national Intelligence just how he is supposed to communicate with Congress, and so the risk to the whistleblower is retaliation.\u201d\n\nThis is flat-out false. Unlike the quick two-step dance he performed with Anderson Cooper, Schiff simply says the committee had not spoken to the whistleblower. Now we know that\u2019s not true.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRegarding Chairman Schiff\u2019s comments on \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019 in the context, he intended to answer the question of whether the Committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not,\u201d a committee spokesman told The Fact Checker. \u201cAs he said in his answer, the whistleblower was then awaiting instructions from the Acting DNI as to how the whistleblower could contact the Committee. Nonetheless he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe spokesman pointed to an interview with Schiff by the Daily Beast, in which he said that he \u201cdid not know definitively at the time if the complaint had been authored by the same whistleblower who had approached his staff.\u201d But he added that he \u201cshould have been much more clear.\u201d\n\nSept. 19, meeting with reporters at the Capitol\n\nAD\n\nSchiff: \u201cIn the absence of the actions, and I want to thank the inspector general, in the absence of his actions in coming to our committee, we might not have even known there was a whistleblower complaint alleging an urgent concern.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s some more dissembling. Schiff says that if not for the IG, the committee might never have known about the complaint. But his committee knew that something explosive was going to be filed with the IG. As the New York Times put it, the initial inquiry received by the committee \u201calso explains how Mr. Schiff knew to press for the complaint when the Trump administration initially blocked lawmakers from seeing it.\u201d\n\nSchiff, however, does qualify that this was a complaint alleging \u201can urgent concern,\u201d and it\u2019s not clear whether the initial inquiry had tipped off the committee staff that it would rise to that level. Still, Schiff\u2019s phrasing was misleading because he gives no hint that the committee was aware a potentially significant (\u201cprivileged\u201d) complaint might have been filed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs Chairman Schiff has made clear, he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, has had no communication with them or their attorney, and did not view the whistleblower\u2019s complaint until the day prior to the hearing with the DNI when the ODNI finally provided it to the Committee,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWhistleblowers frequently come to the committee. Some whistleblowers approach the IG without notice to the Committee, and some who do go to the IG do not necessarily file a complaint. However, this was the first whistleblower complaint provided to the Committee this year that the IC IG determined to be of \u2018urgent concern\u2019 and \u2018credible,\u2019 and Chairman Schiff would have raised the alarm regardless when it was illegally withheld.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe spokesman added: \u201cThe focus should not be on the whistleblower, but rather the complaint which the IC IG determined was credible and urgent and which has been thus far confirmed by the call record released by the White House and statements by the President and his personal attorney.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThere are right ways and wrong ways to answer reporters\u2019 questions if a politician wants to maintain his or her credibility. There\u2019s nothing wrong with dodging a question, as long as you don\u2019t try to mislead (as Pompeo did).\n\nAD\n\nBut Schiff on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d clearly made a statement that was false. He now says he was answering the wrong question, but if that was the case, he should have quickly corrected the record. He compounded his falsehood by telling reporters a few days later that if not for the IG\u2019s office, the committee would not have known about the complaint. That again suggested there had been no prior communication.\n\nThe explanation that Schiff was not sure it was the same whistleblower especially strains credulity.\n\nSchiff earns Four Pinocchios.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\n\nAD", "description": "The lawmaker heading the impeachment inquiry misled reporters about his committee's contacts with the whistleblower before the complaint was filed.", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/B7iPWCZvqptGkFE5-MbTTlEFxDs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OSJK7TXGDQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
