Some set fires, hurled petrol bombs at police and burned the Chinese national flag, in a direct challenge to authorities in Beijing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"FUNCTIONING WELL\"\n\nThe current \"precarious situation\", which endangered public safety, left no timely solution but the anti-mask law, Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong's chief secretary, wrote on his blog on Sunday.\n\nHe urged people to oppose violence ahead of grassroots district council elections set for Nov. 24.\n\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan also addressed the protests in his blog, saying that despite recent obstacles, Hong Kong's banking system remained sound and the financial market was functioning well.\n\nProtesters have taken aim at some of China's largest banks, trashing ATM machines at branches of Bank of China's Hong Kong unit, for example, while nearby international counterparts, such as Standard Chartered, have escaped untouched.\n\nChan's comment came after Hong Kong's Monetary Authority said about 5% of the city's ATMs could not transact cash withdrawals for 'various reasons.'", "description": "Hong Kong's rail operator reopened part of its metro system on Sunday after an unprecedented shutdown, but kept many typically busy stations closed, as the Chinese-ruled city braces for large demonstrations expected later in the day.
