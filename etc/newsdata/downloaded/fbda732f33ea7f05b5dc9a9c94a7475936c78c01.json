When you say a statement like that, it\u2019s so deceptive,\u201d he said, a press conference with Italy\u2019s Sergio Mattarella.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A number of senior Republicans, including senators Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell condemned the decision. Others said the Kurds, who had spearheaded an international operation to crush Isis had been abandoned.\n\nImmediately after Mr Trump\u2019s withdrawal of US troops, Turkish troops and allied Syrian Arab groups, swept into northeast Syria.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee, while there were reports of rape and killing by invading fighters. Hundreds of family members of Isis fighters escaped from prisons operated by the Kurds. The Kurds themselves broker a deal with the Syrian government, to protect them against Turkey\u2019s advance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our land,\u201d Mr Trump insisted, after saying in the situation in the region was \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d from an American perspective.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

That\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like you to believe.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOur soldiers are not in harm\u2019s way, as they shouldn\u2019t be, as two countries fight over land. That has nothing to do with us.\u201c\n\nTurkey wanted to establish a buffer zone inside Syria to protect itself from the Kurds, which it claims are linked to the PKK, a Kuridish organisation seeking autonomy in Turkey and which Ankara considers a terrorist group.\n\nMr Trump repeated what appeared to be a a Turkish government talking point when he said: \u201cThe PKK, which is a part of the Kurds...is probably worse at terror, more of a terrorist threat in many ways, than Isis.\u201d\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of US forces, the Kurds who made up the Syrian Defence Force, brokered a deal with the government in Damascus with Russia as intermediaries.\n\nMr Trump concluded by saying: \u201cRussia hates Isis as much as the United States does.. We\u2019re fighting a war for Russia? We\u2019re fighting a war for Iran? We\u2019re killing Isis and we\u2019re 7,000 miles away.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump has angrily dismissed the suggestion he gave a green light for Turkey to invade Syria, despite analysts saying his withdrawal of US troops did precisely that.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/16/13/trump-greenlight.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
