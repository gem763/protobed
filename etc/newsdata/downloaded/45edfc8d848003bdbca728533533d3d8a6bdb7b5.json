It is expected to stay put until at least later in the morning.\n\nThe exact toll of the devastation in the Bahamas will not be clear until the storm passes and rescue crews can get on the ground.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a historic tragedy in parts of our northern Bahamas,\" Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis told a news conference on Monday. \"Our mission and focus now is search, rescue and recovery.\"\n\nHe added that the U.S. Coast Guard was on the ground in Abaco and had rescued a number of injured individuals. Critically injured people were being taken to hospitals on New Providence, the country's most populous island.\n\nAs many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said.\n\nHouses in a neighborhood in Freeport on Grand Bahama Island were engulfed by 6 feet (1.8 m) of water. \"It looks like they're boats on top of the water,\" said Rosa Knowles-Bain, 61, a resident who fled two days ago to an emergency shelter.\n\nDorian was expected to drift to the northwest late on Tuesday and stalk the coasts of Florida, South Carolina and Georgia, it said.\n\nForecasters have told Floridians not to become complacent, as the storm is now predicted to stay off the coast.\n\n\"It's not that far off shore,\" said Robbie Berg, a forecaster and hurricane specialist with the NHC.\n\n\"All it has to do is jog a little bit west and you have a full-on hurricane rolling through Florida,\" he said. \"No one is out of the woods.\"\n\nEVACUATIONS\n\nNine counties in Florida have issued mandatory evacuations. They included parts of Duval County, home to Jacksonville, one of Florida's two biggest cities, and some areas in Palm Beach County, home to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis urged coastal residents to heed evacuation orders.\n\nAmong those being evacuated was Sue Watson, a 93-year-old resident of a retirement community in Kissimmee in central Florida.\n\n\"I was all set to stay home until they had to turn the water off,\" said Watson, who added she was not worried for her personal safety but hoped the storm spared the retirement community.\n\nThe storm was causing havoc for travelers on Florida's east coast, where some airports and gasoline stations were closed.\n\nOrlando International Airport, one of the largest in the state, planned to cease commercial operations at 2 a.m. on Tuesday because of the storm, it said in a statement.\n\nWalt Disney World Resort in Orlando will close early on Tuesday, it said in a statement.\n\nSouth Carolina Governor Henry McMaster ordered mandatory evacuations for parts of eight coastal counties effective at noon on Monday. More than 830,000 people were under evacuation orders in Charleston and other coastal communities in the state, emergency management officials announced.\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp ordered evacuations in six coastal counties, including all of Savannah's 150,000 residents, also effective at noon on Monday, Kemp's office said on Twitter.\n\nVirginia Governor Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency in his state on Monday, his office said, anticipating the southeast coast could be hit by the storm on Thursday.\n\nDorian was tied with Gilbert (1988), Wilma (2005) and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane for the second-strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, based on maximum sustained winds. Allen in 1980 was the most powerful, with 190 miles (306-kph) winds, the NHC said.\n\n(Reporting by Dante Carrer in Marsh Harbour, Bahamas, Gabriella Borter in Titusville, Florida, Peter Szekely and Kenneth Li in New York, Steve Holland in Washington, Rebekah F.
