Observers are predicting a weak turnout in December.\n\nBenflis, 75, served as premier under Bouteflika from 2000 to 2003.\n\nAfter his dismissal, Benflis ran as Bouteflika's main opponent in 2004 and 2014, coming a distant second both times as the president was re-elected with over 80% of the vote.\n\nTebboune, 73, was a senior civil servant before serving as a minister from the 1990s.\n\nAfter Bouteflika assumed the presidency in 1999, Tebboune was minister of communication, obtaining further portfolios in 2002.\n\nBouteflika appointed him prime minister in May 2017 before sacking him less than three months later against a backdrop of factional fighting in government.\n\nOther Bouteflika-era stalwarts are also running, including Azzedine Mihoubi, leader of the Democratic National Rally party (RND) which was the main ally of the former president's party, and Islamist former tourism minister Abdelkader Bengrina.\n\nThe elections authority, which was recently formed to oversee the vote, has seven days to approve the nominations before passing the list to Algeria's constitutional council for final validation.", "description": "Algeria's election authority has registered 22 candidates for a December presidential election, including two former prime ministers under former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the official APS agency reported on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
