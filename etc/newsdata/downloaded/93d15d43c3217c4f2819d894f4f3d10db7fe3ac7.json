It can be done so quickly, all you have to do is put your mind to it.\n\n\u201cHonestly I feel like giving up on everything. Shut down completely. Why bother when the world is such a mess and people don\u2019t seem to care. I\u2019m going to take a moment away to gather my thoughts. Thank you to those of you who do give a damn about the world.\u201d\n\nThe critics were quick to point out the unsustainability of his positon as his name trended on Twitter:\n\nLewis Hamilton; Owns a \u00a325 million private jet. Races cars for a living. Has a \u00a313 million car collection. Owns a \u00a33 million yacht. Avoided taxes on his jet using tax avoidance scheme.

Fellow Brit Damon Hill said Hamilton\u2019s jet-setting lifestyle opened him up to deserved criticism \u2013 but has backed his environmental concerns.\n\nLewis will get no end of flack for this, being a jet stetting F1 star We are all hypocritical to greater or lesser degrees But if people like him don\u2019t speak out then we all carry on in the same vein and don\u2019t even try to change. Its not that bad, eating carrots #f1 #carrotts https://t.co/UfIEA0282S \u2014 Damon Hill (@HillF1) October 15, 2019\n\nThe racing driver previously spoke about his own decision to go vegan two years ago. He told the BBC how he stopped eating red meat and was now \u201cpescatarian for the majority of the year and now I\u2019ve cut fish.\u201d He continued:\n\n\u201cAs the human race, what we are doing to the world\u2026 the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible.\n\n\u201cThey say it is more than what we produce with our flights and our cars, which is kind of crazy to think, the cruelty is horrible and I don\u2019t necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\u201d", "description": "British\u00a0Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton has told his fans to go vegan to \"save the planet\" despite his own penchant for...", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/lewis-hamilton-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
