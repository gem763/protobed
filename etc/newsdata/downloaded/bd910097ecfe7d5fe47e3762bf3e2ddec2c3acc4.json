Millions of Guns Change Hands That Way, Experts Say", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "Reports say that the gunman who murdered seven people in a mass shooting in Odessa, Texas, on Saturday, legally never should have been able to buy a gun. But after reportedly failing a federal background check, he managed to get ahold of a gun anyway by purchasing it from a private seller.\n\nSome experts say that this case shows that private sales are a \u201cgaping loophole\u201d in the background check law, which must be closed to reduce gun violence.\n\nAbout 22 percent of gun owners in the United States report obtaining their most recent firearm in the last two years without a background check\u2014which means millions of guns are exchanged this way each year.\n\nThe question of expanding federal background checks has taken on increased urgency over the last year. The House of Representatives passed an expanded background check bill earlier this year. President Donald Trump has gone back and forth on background checks. After shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas last month, he has expressed willingness to support expanding the law, but on Sunday he said that the measure wouldn\u2019t have stopped most shootings.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, sadly, if you look at the last four or five (shootings) going back even five or six or seven years \u2026 as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it,\u201d Trump said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHowever, some background check advocates say that the Odessa shooting illustrates why closing loopholes in the law is crucial for preventing gun violence. As California Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat, tweeted after the shooting, \u201cCould there be a more compelling case for why we need universal background checks?\u201d\n\nThe shooter tried to buy a gun from a registered dealer, but failed the background check. So he bought the gun in a private sale, no background check required. Then he shot 30 people, killing 7.\n\n\n\nCould there be a more compelling case for why we need universal background checks? https://t.co/MCMmUbvBwP\n\n\n\n\u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 3, 2019\n\nNot all legislators were convinced that the Odessa shooting should be interpreted in this way. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican who has voted against universal background checks, responded to Schiff\u2019s tweet that the expanded law would only have prevented the shooting if the law had been \u201cself-enforce[d].\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first mass shooting where a universal background check *possibly* would have prevented him from having a gun, if and only if, they decided to self-enforce that law. Guys who shoot cops tend not to self-enforce laws. And we don\u2019t make sweeping policy on one situation,\u201d Crenshaw wrote on Twitter.\n\nThis is the 1st mass shooting where a universal background check *possibly* would have prevented him from having a gun, if and only if, they decided to self-enforce that law.\n\n\n\nGuys who shoot cops tend not to self-enforce laws.\n\n\n\nAnd we don\u2019t make sweeping policy on one situation. https://t.co/RlJ2S3Anau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) September 4, 2019\n\nGun violence experts, meanwhile, say that while closing background check loopholes won\u2019t prevent every mass shooting, expanding the law is an essential component of keeping guns away from people who are potentially dangerous.\n\nAccording to Dr. Garen Wintemute, the director of U.C. Davis\u2019s Violence Prevention Research Program, closing the private sales loophole would make it more difficult for criminals to avoid creating a paper trail or for a prohibit a banned person from buying a firearm. Otherwise, Wintemute says, there\u2019s little to prevent people from selling guns to people that they don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a crime for the seller to sell to me, a prohibited person, if \u2013 to use the exact words- \u2018they know or have reasonable cause to believe\u201d that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Wintemute says. \u201cWhat extending background checks to private party sales does is make the operations of the criminal market much less efficient.\u201d\n\nDr. Michael Siegel, a professor at Boston University School of Public Health, says that the idea that laws don\u2019t matter makes about as much sense to him as removing traffic lights from roadways and having an \u201chonor system.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraffic lights save lives, create order where there would be chaos. And there\u2019s no question that [background checks] save lives, even though there are people who are occasionally going to violate the law,\u201d Siegel says.", "description": "After reportedly failing a background check, he got a gun from a private seller", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/glOYkcQwBiChlfn7ydbYig--~B/aD02ODQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/a431a67d87633aac7051a99352de0fde"}
