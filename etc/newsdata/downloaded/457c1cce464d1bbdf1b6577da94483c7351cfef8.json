REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo\n\nIran, however, again denied involvement in the Sept. 14 raids, which hit the world\u2019s biggest crude processing facility and initially knocked out half of Saudi production.\n\n\u201cThey want to impose maximum ... pressure on Iran through slander,\u201d Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want conflict in the region ... Who started the conflict?\u201d he added, blaming Washington and its Gulf allies for war in Yemen.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi movement, an ally of Iran battling a Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition for more than four years, has claimed responsibility and said it used drones to assault state oil company Aramco\u2019s sites.\n\nHowever, the Saudi Defence Ministry said it would present \u201cmaterial evidence and Iranian weapons proving the Iranian regime\u2019s involvement in the terrorist attack\u201d at a news conference on Wednesday at 1430 GMT.\n\nWhether Iran or an Iran-aligned group carried out Saturday\u2019s attack, it still exposed the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure and threw down a gauntlet to the United States which wants to curb Tehran\u2019s influence in the region.\n\nConcrete evidence showing Iranian responsibility, if made public, could pressure Riyadh and Washington into a response, though both nations were stressing the need for caution.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said he does not want war and is coordinating with Gulf and European states.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the hit on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporter was a \u201creal test of the global will\u201d to confront subversion of international order.\n\nHis envoy to London, Prince Khalid bin Bander, told the BBC the attack was \u201calmost certainly\u201d Iranian-backed but: \u201cWe\u2019re trying not to react too quickly because the last thing we need is more conflict in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cCOMPELLING EVIDENCE\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was to meet Prince Mohammed in Jeddah on Wednesday to discuss the crisis before heading to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nUnited Nations officials monitoring sanctions on Iran and Yemen were also heading to Saudi Arabia to investigate.\n\nFrance, which is trying to salvage an international nuclear deal with Iran that Washington quit last year, said it wants to establish facts before reacting.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters the strikes originated in southwestern Iran. Three officials said they involved cruise missiles and drones, indicating a higher degree of complexity and sophistication than initially thought.\n\nThe officials did not provide evidence or explain what U.S. intelligence they were using for evaluating the attack that cut 5% of global production.\n\nSaudi Arabia said on Tuesday the 5.7 million barrels per day of output lost would be fully restored by the end of the month.\n\nOil prices fell after the Saudi reassurances, having surged more than 20% at one point on Monday - the biggest intra-day jump since the 1990-91 Gulf War. [O/R]\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s finance minister told Reuters on Wednesday the attack had no impact on revenues and Aramco was continuing to supply markets without interruption.\n\nU.S. efforts to bring about a U.N. Security Council response look unlikely to succeed as Russia and China have veto powers and are expected to shield Iran.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who has offered to sell Riyadh defence systems, called for a \u201cthorough and impartial\u201d probe during a phone call with Prince Mohammed.\n\nThe assault exposed serious gaps in Saudi air defences despite billions of dollars spent on Western military hardware and repeated attacks on vital assets during its four-and-a-half year foray into the Yemen war.\n\n\u201cThe attack is like Sept. 11th for Saudi Arabia, it is a game changer,\u201d said one Saudi security analyst.\n\nIRAN-U.S. CONFLICT\n\nAlready frayed U.S.-Iran ties deteriorated further when Trump quit the nuclear pact and reimposed sanctions, severely hurting the Iranian economy. Iran has ruled out talks with Washington unless it returns to the pact.\n\nTrump said he is not looking to meet Rouhani during a U.N. event in New York this month. Rouhani and his foreign minister may not attend the General Assembly at all if U.S. visas are not issued in coming hours, state media reported Wednesday.\n\nWashington and its Gulf allies want Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including in Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon.\n\nDespite years of air strikes against them, the Houthi movement boasts drones and missiles able to reach deep into Saudi Arabia, the result of an arms race since the Western-backed coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nIran\u2019s clerical rulers support the Houthis, who ousted Yemen\u2019s internationally recognised government from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014. But Tehran denies it actively supports them with military and financial support.\n\nIran maintains the largest ballistic and cruise missile capabilities in the Middle East that could overwhelm virtually any Saudi missile defence system, according to think-tank CSIS, given the geographic proximity of Tehran and its proxy forces.\n\nBut even more limited strikes have proved too much for Saudi Arabia, including recent ones claimed by the Houthis on a civilian airport, oil pumping stations and the Shaybah oilfield.", "description": "Saudi Arabia promised evidence on Wednesday linking its main regional adversary Iran to an unprecedented attack on its oil industry, which Washington also blames on Tehran in a perilous escalation of Middle East frictions.", "authors": ["Stephen Kalin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431149964&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0IV", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
