This time, she voted for centrist Gesher party \u201cto see change\u201d.\n\n\u201c1 billion shekels were spent on this election. A billion. And for what? The politicians try to sell us nothing,\" she told The Independent.\n\n\u201cBibi is not royalty, it\u2019s time for a change,\u201d she added.\n\nIn April Mr Netanyahu, campaigning under the shadow of indictment on corruption charges, attempted to form a right-wing coalition government but was scuppered in the eleventh hour by his former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman.\n\nMr Lieberman heads the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party and refused to lend his five seats to Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, leaving the embattled premier several seats short of the 61 needed to form a majority.\n\nIt might be the end of Netanyahu, it feels like he might be holding the party back. He seems to be the sticking point in negotiations with other parties\n\nDaniel Katz, Israeli voter\n\nOther parties also refused to join citing Mr Netanyahu\u2019s likely indictment on graft charges.\n\nThis round, Mr Lieberman\u2019s party is expected to nearly double their seats but has preliminarily promised to join forces with centrist Blue and White party, which is headed by Israel\u2019s ex-army chief Benny Gantz, Mr Netanyahu\u2019s chief rival.\n\nIt could once again cost Mr Netanyahu his crown.\n\nThe last polls published over the weekend showed Mr Netanyahu neck and neck with Mr Gantz, with both their parties securing around 32 seats.\n\nThey also predicted, without Mr Lieberman neither Mr Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing block nor Mr Gantz\u2019s centre-left allies will be able to secure enough seats together to form a ruling government.\n\nAnd while the polls in Israel are notoriously wrong, in the last week a frenzied Mr Netanyahu has taken no chances.\n\nFeeling the heat, and that his career may be on the line, he stormed into the elections with all guns blazing.\n\nIn seven days, he promised to annex all Israeli settlements in the West Bank if he is re-elected, he mulled a defence treaty with President Trump, he visited Russia to see President Putin and he even, according to Israeli media, very nearly launched a military operation in Gaza.", "description": "The unifying cry across the leaflet-strewn polling stations of Israel, a country deeply divided, was \u201cplease no more elections\u201d.From leftists on the beach front of Tel Aviv to hard-right voters in Israeli settlements, no one could see the point in the country heading to the polls for the second time", "authors": ["Bel Trew", "Shira Rubin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lsEWFEZbFAQwTra6MV6.pQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/dcdf96e4d6f47d58f6a3b25ca841dadf", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
