REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nLorry driver Maurice Robinson, 25, is set to appear in court charged with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences, including conspiracy to traffic people, after the bodies were found last week in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of London.\n\nBritish police have said very few of the victims were carrying official identification and that they hope to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photographs from friends and relatives.\n\nVietnam\u2019s government website quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son as saying the Ministry of Public Security had received files for four people from Britain, seeking \u201cverification coordination\u201d.\n\nSon told reporters, \u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is developing dossiers of possible victims, but until now there have been no grounds to confirm Vietnamese nationals are among the victims.\u201d\n\nPolice had initially said the dead were believed to be Chinese, but it later emerged that many were from Vietnam, where communities have been plunged into despair in the belief their missing loved ones are dead.\n\nIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China\u2019s embassy in Vietnam was in close contact with the Vietnamese government about the case, but did not elaborate.\n\nChina is also asking Britain to provide more information so as to ascertain the victims\u2019 identities, he added.\n\nIn Britain, police said a man was arrested in Dublin on Saturday.\n\n\u201cA man arrested by the Garda at Dublin port on Saturday, 26 October, is a person of interest in our murder investigation,\u201d Essex Police said.\n\nThree people arrested in connection with the investigation had been released on bail, British police said on Sunday. All three had been questioned on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.\n\nAbout 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in Britain between 2009 and 2016 were for labour exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail salons, the British government said last year.\n\nThe suspected victims in the most recent incident hail from Vietnam\u2019s northern rice-growing areas of Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of the communist-ruled nation\u2019s poorest provinces.\n\nNghe An was identified as home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation.\n\nThe other province, Ha Tinh, was ravaged by one of Vietnam\u2019s worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan\u2019s Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating fishing and tourism there.", "description": "Britain has sent dossiers to Vietnam, seeking its assistance in identifying four of the 39 people found dead in a truck container outside London last week, the government of the southeast Asian nation said on Monday.", "authors": ["Phuong Nguyen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445773572&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0HR", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
