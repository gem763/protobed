One truck was always there: a long, white semi with the words Mobile Chapel painted on the side. Each time he drove past it, he\u2019d imagine the conversations that were going on inside. Who was in there? What kind of stories were being told? \u201cThe whole idea of a mobile chapel dedicated to long-haul truckers seemed a bit out of the ordinary,\u201d Cohn told me. \u201cI mean, who opens a church in the back of a semi-truck?\u201d\n\nCohn, a documentary filmmaker, had to quench his insatiable curiosity. One day, he stopped and went inside. That\u2019s how he first met Chad Romera, a chaplain who has dedicated his life to lending an ear to interstate truck drivers.\n\n\u201cChad had such a welcoming personality,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cHe wasn't judgmental or preachy. He simply presented himself as a listener.\u201d The two men connected over their shared interest in human stories, and Romera agreed to allow Cohn to make a film about the Mobile Chapel. \u201cI have a tremendous amount of respect for Chad,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cIt takes incredible fortitude and sacrifice to sit in the back of a semi-truck and listen to wayward truckers day and night. That kind of isolation followed by intense moments of focus and empathy felt familiar to me as a documentary filmmaker.\u201d\n\nDestination Park, Cohn\u2019s short documentary, premieres on The Atlantic today. It\u2019s a meditative window into the lives of truck drivers, many of whom describe experiencing overwhelming solitude, alienation from their families, and an ongoing struggle to pay the bills amidst medical challenges and the widespread layoffs plaguing in the industry. Economists predict that the freight industry is on the brink of a major recession.\n\n\u201cIf I had to do it over again, no, I wouldn\u2019t be a trucker,\u201d says one driver in the film. \u201cThe middle-class man struggles more and more every day. I got two sons, and I told them, \u2018Don\u2019t think about trucking.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile filming, Cohn said he was struck by the emotional toll that the job\u2019s financial stresses and isolation take on many drivers.\n\nOne driver admits that he\u2019s attempted suicide half a dozen times. \u201cWhat scares me is not having financial security \u2026 uselessness, not knowing what you\u2019re gonna do next.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have absolutely no interaction with anybody,\u201d says another trucker. \u201cSolitude is all we know.\u201d\n\nThe filmmaker also observed a \u201cglowing sense of camaraderie\u201d among the truckers he encountered. \u201cThey really view themselves as a dying breed\u2014foot soldiers fighting for a way of life that may soon be replaced by automation.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Cohn feels that films like Destination Park are necessary platforms for a community of Americans that often feel misunderstood.\n\n\u201cI think this demographic of America is looked at through the lens of politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are simply [seen as] voters\u2014not real, complex people with equally complex problems. We need more resources funneled to storytellers in these areas. We need to hear these folks from a humanistic point of view.\u201d", "description": "Deep within Trump's America, destitute truck drivers confide their anxieties, frustrations, hopes, and fears in the chaplain of a mobile chapel.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/08/unnamed_2/video-featured.jpg"}
