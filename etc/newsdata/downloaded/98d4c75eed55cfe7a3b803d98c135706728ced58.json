You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhile the usual sartorial splendour unfolded, there was also a newfound surge of energy on the Milan runways with an art-themed fashion show, a pop icon's runway debut and models staging mental health protests.\n\nAnd that\u2019s before we even get started on the clothing which, after all, is what fashion week is all about.\n\nWith Milan\u2019s stint done and dusted, here, we take a look back at some of the best moments from the event.\n\nJ.Lo broke the internet\n\nJennifer Lopez sent social media into meltdown when she closed the Versace show in a remake of the jungle green dress she wore to the 2000 Grammys.\n\nAt the time, so many people searched for images of the now-iconic ensemble that Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, said the website was inspired to create Google Image Search.\n\nAt the end of the Versace show, which riffed heavily off the palm print that has since become synonymous with J-Lo\u2019s gown, Donatella's voice came over the sound system, saying: \u201cOK Google, now show me the real jungle dress\u201d.\n\nOn cue, Lopez stormed the runway in a new version of the dress causing pretty much everyone sitting on the front row to capture the moment on their phones and flood social media with snaps.\n\nFor the grand finale, the singer returned to the runway arm-in-arm with Versace herself, prompting rapturous applause from attendees.\n\nGucci model staged mental health protest on the runway\n\nAlessandro Michele's SS20 Gucci show was one to remember, but perhaps not for reasons the creative director could have hoped.\n\nOn Sunday, the luxury brand presented its latest collection in a stark, brightly lit room filled with plastic waiting room chairs and metal shutters covering the doors.\n\nThe show began with a number of models being transported down the runway on a moving conveyor belt wearing looks Michele said were inspired by straitjackets.\n\nIn an unplanned protest, model Ayesha Tan-Jones, aka YaYa Bones, who walked in one of the straitjacket-inspired ensembles, wrote the words \u201cmental health is not fashion\u201d on their palms ahead of the show, holding up their hands to the cameras as they made their way around the space.\n\nJones, who identifies as non-binary, later uploaded a video from the show on Instagram and explained that as someone who has previously suffered with mental health issues, they found Gucci\u2019s designs deeply offensive.\n\nGucci responded saying the garment was taken out of context and was part of a broader concept about breaking free.\n\n\u201cThese clothes were a statement for the fashion show and will not be sold,\u201d the brand wrote on Instagram, explaining that Michele designed the clothes \u201cto represent how through fashion, power is exercised over life, to eliminate self-expression\u201d.\n\nIn response, the model chose to donate their fee to a number of mental health charities.\n\nMoschino turned its models into literal works of art\n\nFashion designer Jeremy Scott is an expert when it comes to transforming his catwalk into a work of art and his latest show for Moschino proved it.\n\nIn keeping with the brand\u2019s kitschy designs, Scott\u2019s Picasso-influenced show saw models literally turn into pieces of art.\n\nWhile some designs were more nuanced in their representation of the painter's work, others saw Kaia Gerber transform into cubist sculpture of a guitar, Bella Hadid sport a harlequin-checked Pierrot clown number and Joan Smalls resemble a matador.\n\n\u201cI think people need to get over the loftiness of when you call something art,\u201d Scott said of the inspiration behind the collection.\n\n\u201cI am an artist \u2014 I just work through the medium of fashion, through apparel and models and the scenography of a show, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m an artist.\n\nThe designer concluded by calling the debate an \u201cold silly argument that people have had for so long\u201d.\n\nSilvia Venturini Fendi made her ready-to-wear debut\n\nFendi\u2019s autumn/winter 2019 show concluded with an emotional video of the late Karl Lagerfeld, who died just a few days before Milan Fashion Week in February.\n\nFast forward seven months and the fashion house\u2019s SS20 collection marked a new era for the brand, one which saw Silvia Venturini Fendi take the helm and make her womenswear debut.\n\nOriginally creative director of accessories and menswear, Fendi \u2013 who is the granddaughter of the brand\u2019s founders \u2013 showcased her first solo ready-to-wear show in a giant light installation.\n\nIt was perhaps fitting for Fendi\u2019s first show since the passing of Lagerfeld to look to the 1960s for inspiration, since that\u2019s when the fashion icon first started working with the brand.\n\nModels walked down the runway dressed in retro floral dresses, crochet separates, a sepia-toned colour pallet and suits adorned with oversized collars.\n\nIn a recent interview with Business of Fashion, Fendi talked about life at the brand without Lagerfeld.\n\n\u201cKarl was with Fendi for 54 years, so it doesn\u2019t sound \u2018natural\u2019 to refer to \u2018the Karl Lagerfeld era.\u2019 Now it\u2019s just the way we all think here,\u201d she said.\n\nPrada rallied against disposable fashion\n\nFor SS20, Miuccia Prada focused on simplicity and timeless pieces as a direct response to fashion\u2019s excessive waste.\n\nThe designer said she was interested in style \u2014 not fashion \u2014 and set out to create clothes that would last forever.\n\n\u201cIn this moment where there is excess and too much, and everybody is complaining that there\u2019s too much fashion, too much clothes \u2014 I tried to work so that the person is more important than the clothes and the fashion,\u201d Prada explained after the show.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a giant political problem that everyone needs to address in their own way and through their own efforts.\u201d\n\nAs a business, Prada is working on its ethical credentials. In May, the brand announced that it would no longer use fur in its products, starting from this SS20 collection, and it became one of 32 fashion brands to sign up to the Fashion Pact \u2014 an initiative to fight climate change and improve sustainability \u2014 last month.", "description": "Milan Fashion Week marks the mid-way point of a month-long sartorial spectacle as designers showcase their latest creations to editors and influencers alike.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/07/gettyimages-1176393593.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
