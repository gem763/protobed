The two main parties - the ruling People\u2019s party (PP) and the Socialists (PSOE) - suffer big loses at the expense of newcomers (leftwing) Podemos and (rightwing) Ciudadanos. Neither the PP nor the PSOE manage to secure a majority in parliament to form a new government, so \u2026 2016 General election \u2026 another election is held in June. Voter turnout is the lowest since the transition to democracy in 1975. The PP\u2019s vote share increases, but parliamentary deadlock continues. PSOE leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez refuses to allow PP leader Mariano Rajoy to form a minority government, citing the corruption scandals swirling around the PP. S\u00e1nchez resigns Years of simmering discontent among PSOE members with S\u00e1nchez boil over and he is ousted as leader after powerful factions rebel against his refusal to allow Rajoy to form a government. Rajoy secures role as PM With S\u00e1nchez gone, the political paralysis is broken and Rajoy returns as PM after the PSOE abstains on an investiture vote in parliament. S\u00e1nchez re-elected S\u00e1nchez regains the leadership of the still-divided PSOE, his hardline anti-Rajoy stance bolstered by a slew of corruption scandals involving former senior PP figures in Madrid\u2019s regional government. Rajoy testifies in court Rajoy becomes the first serving Spanish PM to testify in a criminal case. He emphatically denied any knowledge of an illegal funding racket in the PP. Cifuentes scandal The president of Madrid\u2019s regional government, PP's Cristina Cifuentes, resigns after video footage emerged of her apparently being caught stealing two tubs of face cream seven years previously. Rajoy had refused to heed calls to sack Cifuentes after an earlier scandal involving false claims about her academic qualifications. S\u00e1nchez becomes PM The PSOE calls a vote of no confidence in the scandal-plagued Rajoy administration, and it passes through parliament with the help of regional parties and Podemos. S\u00e1nchez is sworn in as PM the next day. Budget impasse S\u00e1nchez is unable to get his 2019 budget passed through parliament after the Basque and Catalan nationalist parties who had supported him against Rajoy vote against it. Yet another election is called. 2019 general election Another inconclusive election sees the PSOE increases its vote share, as the PP vote plummets and the far-right Vox party enters parliament for the first time. Speculation immediately turns to how the PSOE will secure the majority needed to form a government.\n\nS\u00e1nchez also took aim at the conservatives and pro-independence Catalan parties who overcame their bitter enmity to trigger the snap election by rejecting his government\u2019s 2019 budget.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t got to where we are today because of disagreements between progressive parties but because pro-independence and conservative parties pooled their votes to topple a progressive government,\u201d he said.\n\nIglesias gave the policies a cautious welcome, telling Spanish TV that while they \u201csounded good\u201d, he and his colleagues would need to study them in detail before making any decisions.\n\nEven if S\u00e1nchez manages to win over Unidas Podemos \u2013 which is far from certain \u2013 he would still need the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party to abstain during the investiture vote.\n\nTensions between Catalan separatists and pro-unity parties remain high and are likely to rise still further when the supreme court delivers its verdict next month in the trial of the 12 regional independence leaders accused of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds over their alleged roles in the failed bid to secede from Spain two years ago.\n\nIf the manoeuvring and horse-trading fail to yield a government by 23 September, another general election will be held on 10 November.\n\nAlthough Spaniards are weary after voting in three general elections since December 2015, two recent polls suggest a repeat poll would benefit the PSOE.\n\nA survey for El Mundo found that the Socialists would again finish first, taking 145 of the 350 seats in congress \u2013 22 more than they managed in April. Unidas Podemos, meanwhile, would win 40 seats, meaning the two parties would easily secure a majority.\n\nAnother poll, for El Espa\u00f1ol, predicted the PSOE and Unidas Podemos would take 176 seats between them.\n\nThe current impasse, however, does not bode well for a deal, and voter fatigue could cause a decrease in turnout.\n\nS\u00e1nchez came to power in June 2018 after using a vote of no confidence to turf the scandal-mired conservative People\u2019s party (PP) out of office. The PP suffered its worst ever results in April\u2019s election as its support collapsed and it lost 71 seats.\n\nThe party\u2019s corruption woes show no sign of abating. On Monday, a judge investigating illegal political financing summoned two former PP presidents of the Madrid region \u2013 Esperanza Aguirre and Cristina Cifuentes \u2013 to answer questions over alleged corruption.\n\nAnother election could also hurt the centre-right Citizens party. The party, led by Albert Rivera, was leading the polls last year until it refused to back S\u00e1nchez\u2019s no-confidence motion.\n\nIts liberal credentials have also been undermined by its decision to enlist the help of the far-right Vox party to take power in Andaluc\u00eda and Madrid.\n\nEl Pa\u00eds\u2019s poll predicts Citizens would drop from 57 seats to 34 in the event of another election, while El Espa\u00f1ol\u2019s suggests it would lose 19 seats.", "description": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez hopes to win over anti-austerity alliance and end political impasse", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbaa9fa2307998d56eb6a21c4ee652065bcd1280/0_185_4143_2486/master/4143.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2852e9855640c4d73f24651cdfd8b5ca"}
