It didn\u2019t really take off until March\u2026 for him. I fell in love way before... I think for me it was first sight.'\n\nCandid: To which he smiled and simply said to the panel: 'It\u2019s early days. I want to enjoy this. Why do we always try to force things?'\n\nShe continued: 'He was going through a difficult time in his relationship. We did become friends and then probably in about February I said, \"I love you Danny\" and he said, \"I know\". It took a while.'\n\nDaniel then told how the couple met while he was still going through a break-up, saying: 'She [Shirley] said, \"I\u2019ll keep an eye on you\" and that was sort of it.'\n\nShirley then hit back at talk around the pair's age gap, adding: 'Well, the press seem to always want to put him down as 44, he\u2019ll be 47 on his next birthday.\n\n'I just think it\u2019s so sexist. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter if an older man gets a younger woman. There\u2019s not much chat about it. There seems to be major chat about this [relationship]. There\u2019s 12 years, 13 maybe.'\n\nSweet: The loved-up pair, who've been together for nine months, spoke about how they met, with the professional dancer saying it was 'love at first sight'\n\nThis comes after Shirley almost jumped out of her seat as she gushed about her 'perfect' beau Daniel in a recent appearance on This Morning.\n\nShirley - who has been married twice before - revealed she'd be delighted to tie the knot to her partner of six months.\n\nWhen quizzed about taking the next step in her romance, she shared: 'Marriage! I do, I do!\n\n'When you get to my age, it\u2019s very difficult to find someone you are compatible with and in every facet in every part of our life we are compatible and that\u2019s just amazing to me.'\n\nSmitten: Daniel then told how the couple met while he was still going through a break-up, saying 'She [Shirley] said, \"I\u2019ll keep an eye on you\" and that was sort of it'\n\nPretending to swoon, Shirley was left red-faced when she was asked whether she'd accept a proposal from The Bill star.\n\nThe skilled choreographer joked: 'Well now we are going a bit far now, you know. But watch this space and see what happens. I've lost the plot!'\n\nShirley married dancer Sammy Stopford when she was 18, with the relationship ending five years later.\n\nShe later tied the knot with ballroom dancer Corky Ballas in 1985 with their son Mark, 33, born the following year. The pair divorced in 2007.", "description": "The Strictly Come Dancing judge, 58, suggested the actor, 46, popped the question live on air when they made a joint appearance on Monday's edition of Loose Women.", "authors": ["Roxy Simons", "Niomi Harris For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/17/19700598-0-image-a-84_1571069365652.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
