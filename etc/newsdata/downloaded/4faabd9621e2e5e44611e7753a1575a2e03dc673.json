I think before the end of the year, for sure. We cannot allow the president to obstruct Congress, to try to run out the clock. We have the whistleblower who has provided this information. We have the president\u2019s own admission to the misconduct. We have this transcript of the phone call, in which it\u2019s laid out, plain and simple. There\u2019s really no additional evidence you need. We\u2019re being very careful to collect more.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Tuesday's broadcast of CNN's \"Situation Room,\" Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) stated that he thinks there needs to be a vote on impeaching | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/05/Cicilline-519-Thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
