And a lovely touch too by the Fifa Council to honour the cherished tradition of Chinese electoral politics, by only having a single candidate. Still, as the old proverb almost goes, you can only beat what\u2019s not put in front of you.\n\nIn retrospect, the decision to award Fifa\u2019s flagship club competition to a country with no prior record of excellence in club football probably shouldn\u2019t have come as much of a surprise. For starters, the fact that the decision was being announced in Shanghai should have been a dead giveaway. And then, of course, you have the identity of the man making the announcement: president Gianni Infantino, who in his three years in the job has displayed, shall we put it, certain preferential character traits.\n\nLook, the guy can\u2019t help it. We all have a \u2018type\u2019. For some, it\u2019s blondes. For others it\u2019s sleeve tattoos, or cute cheek dimples, or guys in indie bands. In the case of Infantino, he seems to have a particular thing for authoritarians, whether it\u2019s genuflecting daintily for Vladimir Putin, slipping on his best suit and dousing himself in cologne to visit Donald Trump in the Oval Office, moistening himself in the presence of King Salman of Saudi Arabia, or flying into Pyongyang at late notice to watch North Korea take on South Korea in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nChina, then, is simply his latest in a long line of guilty crushes. And like anybody with a fatal weakness for bad boys, Gianni is happy to overlook some of their rougher edges. Which is why, when asked in the subsequent press conference about China\u2019s litany of human rights abuses, its crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, its detention of more than a million Uighur Muslims with children being forcibly separated from their parents and sent to \u201cre-education schools\u201d, he looked a little demure. Perhaps you could even sense something stirring within him, the sap beginning to rise, as he grapples with the sweet wrongness of it all. And yet, how can something be wrong when it feels so right?\n\nOf course, Gianni\u2019s no fool. He\u2019s not going to trash his man in public. \u201cIt\u2019s not the mission of Fifa to solve the problems of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a social responsibility due to the magnitude and the power that football brings with it. But we don\u2019t do that by attacking, criticising anyone.\u201d\n\nPerhaps what Gianni\u2019s doing here \u2013 and you don\u2019t rise to the top of the world\u2019s most labyrinthine sports governing body without a nose for chicanery \u2013 is playing the long game. Behind closed doors, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s banging heads together, slamming his fist on the table, demanding answers on behalf of the oppressed peoples of the world. And definitely not laughing heartily at his hosts\u2019 jokes, or discussing revenue streams while sipping on a glass of artesian glacier water flavoured with ocelot\u2019s tears, served by a young woman secretly fearing for her life.\n\nThat it\u2019s not necessarily Fifa\u2019s responsibility to make the world a better place will, nevertheless, come as something of a surprise to some people. Perhaps even to the organisation itself, which three years ago released a document entitled \u201cFifa 2.0: The Vision for the Future\u201d, which stated: \u201cFootball can be a progressive force for good. Institutions must be able to address issues that have not previously been part of their equation: the threat of terrorism, health and wellness, workers\u2019 rights and global warming, to name only a few. Football can be a leader and shape change.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, on the kids\u2019 section of Fifa\u2019s website \u2013 a page you can only assume is ever visited in error by teenagers searching for Ultimate Team Bronze Packs \u2013 you can find the following mission statement: \u201cFootball\u2019s popularity can help make the world a better place. Use the power of football to promote peace and equality. Make the world better through football.\u201d\n\nAnd never let it be said that Fifa doesn\u2019t talk a good game on human rights. After all, it was only in 2017 that it introduced its new human rights policy to vet prospective tournament hosts: the sort of thing corporate institutions do to try and convince themselves they have an intrinsic morality, like a robot trying to teach itself the concept of romance by playing Dean Martin records.\n\nLast year in Zurich, meanwhile, Infantino claimed that the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar \u2013 a place where, hang on, let me just check\u2026 yep, construction workers are still dying! \u2013 had actually improved matters. \u201cWithout the World Cup, these debates would not have happened, and the improvements which happened would not have happened either,\u201d Infantino insisted. In the same way, I suppose, you could say the Hindenburg sparked a lively debate on airship safety. It\u2019s a line of reasoning, to be sure.\n\nNaturally, Gianni isn\u2019t putting his heart out there for nothing. This is, after all, a mutually beneficial relationship, and certainly access to the world\u2019s biggest market is a pretty tasty windfall. It\u2019s the same logic that has led the International Olympic Committee to award the 2022 Winter Olympics to Beijing, that has taken countless European clubs on lucrative Chinese pre-season tours, that recently forced the NBA to slap down the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey after his tweet in support of the Hong Kong protesters set off a wave of fury in China. Still, who hasn\u2019t dated someone with a rotten temper?\n\nAnd this latest romance appears a keeper. Fifa already have a sponsorship deal in place with Chinese conglomerate Wanda, and are trying to encourage a money-spinning Chinese bid for the 2030 World Cup, which by that point will probably feature so many teams that China is the only country left in the world big enough to host it. And now the expanded Club World Cup, which is poised to feature 24 teams, including the four most recent winners of the Champions League and Europa League, which will include Liverpool, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.\n\nPerhaps, in a weird way, this makes sense after all. After all, the new competition will be, as a beaming Infantino boasted, \u201cthe club football event which will generate the highest revenue per match\u201d. So there. Gianni doesn\u2019t care what you think of his new bae. They may make an odd couple, this bald Swiss lawyer and the world\u2019s most powerful nation-state, but ultimately they share the same values, the same hopes, the same dreams. And ultimately, isn\u2019t that the most important thing?", "description": "May this column be one of the first to offer its warmest congratulations to China on winning the vote to host the Fifa 2021 Club World Cup.
