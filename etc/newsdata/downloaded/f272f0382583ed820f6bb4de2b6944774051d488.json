With a UFO lobbyist, of course.\n\nIn December 2017, the New York Times wrote about a de-funded secret Pentagon UFO program called AATIP, and revealed that several Navy pilots in 2004 and 2015 engaged in bizarre encounters with anomalous aerial objects off the coast of California and Florida. Eventually, three videos of \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d were released and have since been confirmed by the Navy as real.\n\nFor years, Steven Bassett was Capitol Hill\u2019s lone UFO lobbyist. He became a registered lobbyist in 1996 and set up an advocacy organization, the Paradigm Research Group (PRG), which has the goal of using \u201call means possible to confront the United States government regarding its policy of a truth embargo on the events and evidence demonstrating an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race and the formal acknowledgement of that presence,\u201d according to Bassett\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cIt's not about UFOs. The term is a product of government propaganda in service to the truth embargo and no longer of value,\u201d Bassett told Motherboard. \u201cIt's about extraterrestrials and the Disclosure process.\u201d\n\nFor those not fully immersed in Ufological culture, \u201cDisclosure\u201d is the total and final admission by the government that extraterrestrials are not only visiting Earth, but that there is a massive government cover-up to hide the truth from the public. The UFO community has even taken to Twitter to raise awareness of the Disclosure process for the 2020 election with the hashtag #askthequestion.\n\n\u201cA significant percentage of all people on Capitol Hill are convinced there is an ET presence. They are just not able to speak to it\u2014publicly,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nBassett\u2019s PRG organization has recently hired Teresa Tindal, another registered lobbyist who is now also fighting for greater transparency about UFOs. Like Bassett, Tindal is convinced that extraterrestrials are visiting Earth and interacting with humans. She believes that the government is complicit in a massive cover-up.\n\n\u201cThe cat\u2019s out of the bag and politicians will be looking to control the issue,\u201d Tindal told Motherboard. \u201cIt is, after all, the most powerful political initiative as it affects absolutely every aspect of life. Polls show most people believe in ET life.\u201d\n\nBassett and Tindal are like the Mulders of the UFO political process, but there is always a Scully. Not everyone who pushes lawmakers to deal with the UFO issue in DC is convinced that aliens should be on the agenda.\n\n\u201cAt no time do we or have we mentioned extraterrestrials. We are simply ensuring our government does not fall victim to \u2018strategic surprise\u2019 by the technology being displayed by [Unknown Aerial Phenomena],\u201d Luis Elizondo, a former intelligence officer who was involved in the Pentagon\u2019s UFO hunting Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, told Motherboard. \u201cWhether it be from Russia, China, allies, or little green men. Our efforts focus on the national security and technology aspect; not ET.\u201d\n\nElizondo explained that he is not a registered lobbyist, nor does he consider himself to be a lobbyist of any sort.\n\n\"Our efforts in Washington are focused on facilitating the flow of information from where it resides to those individuals in key leadership positions in order that they can make a well informed decision. Whether it be one focused on national security, defense, science and technology, or diplomacy, ensuring our elected leaders and those assigned to key positions have the latest and most complete picture is something we believe is critically important,\" Elizondo said.\n\nElizondo currently works for former Blink-182 lead singer Tom DeLonge, and his company To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science. He also appeared on the History Channel\u2019s newest UFO hunting show, Unidentified: Inside America\u2019s UFO Investigation.\n\n\u201cWe simply don't know at this point if non-human technology is even part of the equation,\u201d Elizondo stated. \u201cIt is a nonsensical assertion at this point in time because we simply need more data to even make that initial assessment.\u201d\n\nElizondo\u2019s boss, To the Star\u2019s founder Tom DeLonge, has made his personal beliefs clear on the issue. In his book, Sekret Machines: Gods, co-written with Peter Levenda, DeLonge sums it all up by arguing that humanity was visited by aliens in its distant past, and that all human culture is one big \u201ccargo cult.\u201d\n\nWhile the official party line of the To the Stars\u2019 political lobby may be devoid of the extraterrestrial narrative, Bassett doesn\u2019t buy it.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science\u2019 team are operating under certain conditions laid down by those still inside who are providing cover. No classified content released. Non-disclosure agreements must be honored. Do not talk \u2018extraterrestrial.\u2019 Why? There are factions inside the [military industrial complex] opposed to the TTSA project and would stop it if they could. Therefore restraint is required\u2014for now,\u201d Basset told Motherboard.\n\nTV personality and UFO researcher Chase Kloetzke also works in Washington as a lobbyist meeting with lawmakers about \u2018the phenomenon.\u2019 The issue all of the lobbyists face, Kloetzke explains, is that UFOs are considered sensitive information.\n\n\u201cThis topic is now in the hands of the Pentagon, military strategists and intelligence agencies. It\u2019s all classified. To be part of ANY discussion in DC about UAPs, you need a security clearance,\u201d Kloetzke said in an email. According to Kloetzke, she has \u201cspoken to senior staff for seven lawmakers and two Senators.\u201d While she is unsure as to how much progress she has personally made, she is convinced that To the Stars is a key player in all this and that the Pentagon\u2019s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program is \u201cstill in play.\u201d\n\n\u201cI realized years ago that any kind of Disclosure or Confirmation will only be \u2018Official,\u2019 if it comes from DC. I do this because of the evidence and facts that we can now present to start the process of public information,\u201d Kloetzke said. \u201cWe have unknown objects in our skies. Confirmed! The question now, and the only questions right now are \u2018What are these objects?\u2019 and \u2018Who are the pilots controlling them?\u2019\u201d", "description": "There's been an explosion of UFO lobbyists in DC\u2014from Tom DeLonge to lawyers who demand that the president does a \"Disclosure,\" in which he admits aliens live among us.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d976ae6fa756a000adcd6f2/lede/1570205767341-There-are-UFO-Lobbyists-in-DC-and-Lawmakers-Are-Apparently-Listening.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
