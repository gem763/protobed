That compares with $163 in late August, 2018 when Mr Blackmore's stake was worth around $655 million. The stock was as high as $220 in early January, 2016 when the stake was worth $880 million.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Niraj Shah has a 12-month price target of $84 on the shares, and said that de-stocking and channel disruption in the wake of changes in e-commerce regulations in China had been a major factor. A spike in sales of items such as Vitamin C from a bad flu season in Australia had also failed to materialise, the broker concluded.\n\nMarcus Blackmore holds 23.1 per cent of Blackmores.
