(Max Rose for Congress/Handout via Reuters)\n\nDemocratic freshman congressman Max Rose slammed Beto O\u2019Rourke for being a \u201csocial-media rock star\u201d who prioritizes his public image over winning elections during an interview with New York Magazine.\n\n\u201cWhen you win you get to help people, and when you lose you get to be a social-media rock star. So I don\u2019t think Beto is cool, and I don\u2019t think losing is cool,\u201d Rose said.\n\n\u201cLosing is not as cool as he thinks it is,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Thursday night, O\u2019Rourke called for for religious institutions to lose their tax-exempt status for opposing gay marriage, saying \u201cwe are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nRose represents New York\u2019s 11th district, which includes Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn. Trump won the blue collar district by roughly ten points in 2016. Rose has been critical of his fellow Democratic freshmen representatives since taking office in January, and said in the interview that his goal in Washington was not to be \u201ceveryone\u2019s buddy,\u201d but to \u201cwage war on the entire political class.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party has been completely subsumed by this \u2018What\u2019s the Matter With Kansas,\u2019 mantra,\u201d Rose said. \u201c\u2018Oooh, I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t vote for us? Why can\u2019t they be smarter? Don\u2019t they know all we are doing for them?\u2019 It\u2019s the most offensive, patronizing thing imaginable. And it\u2019s taken over the party. A better question would be: Why don\u2019t they trust us?\u201d\n\nLast week, Rose became the last member of Congress from New York City to back the House\u2019s impeachment probe, saying he will \u201cfully support\u201d the inquiry.\n\nThe Army veteran, 31, was previously opposed to impeachment, arguing in a September op-ed that \u201cwe are in danger of losing the trust of the American people if we choose partisan warfare over improving the lives of hardworking families.\u201d\n\nRose defended the impeachment inquiry to New York Magazine, but said he was not committed to voting for it, and criticized Democratic colleagues who have cheered it on.\n\n\u201cNo one is to blame but the president. The president says he is innocent, so all we are saying is \u2018prove it.\u2019 But that is not what they are doing. They are not cooperating, and we need to get to the bottom of it. \u2026 This is a national tragedy. It is nothing to cheer on, it is nothing to sell T-shirts over,\u201d he said.\n\nRose also stated he believes it was wrong for Hunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, to serve on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma, which Trump suggested as a matter to investigate to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on a July phone call.", "description": "Democratic congressman Max Rose slammed Beto O\u2019Rourke for being a \u201csocial-media rock star\u201d who prioritizes his public image over winning elections.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
