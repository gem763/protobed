Because he will obsess about it. The moment it becomes a live option, the moment a trial in the Senate seems conceivable, he will talk about nothing else. He will rant to his staff and bore foreign leaders about it. He loves a fight. And every moment Donald Trump thinks about impeachment is a moment he is not thinking about doing even more reckless things, like trying to compromise the independence of the Fed, or launching a larger trade war, or stumbling into a real war.\n\nLet me be very clear: I am suggesting that the House impeach Trump for two reasons: 1) he has committed high crimes and misdemeanors; and 2) impeachment will distract Trump from further harming the national interest.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Drezner", "Washingtonpost.Com Outlook Strategic-Case-Impeaching-Donald-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
