(Rafael Crisostomo/For The Washington Post)\n\nA man laughs hysterically in the short video that\u2019s racked up nearly 1 million likes, as the plastic packet of frozen mac and cheese is dropped into a boiler, cut open and then poured into a bowl ready to serve. The woman who posted the clip gives a thumbs-up in the hat that marks her as an employee of Panera Bread.\n\nThe caption on video-sharing app TikTok: \u201cexposing panera.\u201d\n\nThe clip brought a wave of gripes last week from disillusioned customers of a chain known for \u201cfast casual\u201d dining typically perceived as a step above fast food in quality. Commenters said they expected more than warmed-from-frozen dishes, or \u2014 as one critic put it \u2014 \u201cglorified hospital food.\u201d\n\nBut the fallout went both ways, the woman behind the video said, announcing Friday via her newly famous Twitter account: \u201clol i lost my job for this.\u201d\n\nApparently, this is how Panera Bread prepares the mac and cheese.

In a statement, the company defended its preparation methods, explaining that its mac and cheese is still a patently Panera product \u201cmade offsite with our proprietary recipe developed by our chefs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is shipped frozen to our bakery cafes \u2014 this allows us to avoid using preservatives which do not meet our clean standards,\u201d the company said.\n\nMany restaurants are reluctant to admit to heating up frozen food. After a survey of French restaurants found one-third acknowledged serving frozen items, some in the industry said the true number was probably higher because \u201cchefs were embarrassed to admit the short cuts that, in effect, hoodwink their customers,\u201d as The Post reported.\n\nPanera often joins popular chains such as Chipotle and Shake Shack under the label \u201cfast casual.\u201d Fast casual eateries \u201coffer consumers freshly-prepared, higher-quality food in an informal setting, with counter service to keep things speedy,\u201d the website Investopedia explains.\n\n\u201cThe two stalwarts of the American restaurant industry were always fast-food and fine dining, but now the rapidly growing fast-casual restaurant sector has squeezed in between them,\u201d the site adds, though it notes the industry is still dwarfed by traditional fast-food companies such as McDonald\u2019s.\n\nFor some critics, the TikTok video\u2019s depiction of mac-and-cheese preparation was at odds with Panera\u2019s image. Others were less surprised, though, chiming in with their stories of food prep from other chains. And some felt vindicated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said before that Panera bread Mac and cheese is garbage, and here is the proof,\u201d a Twitter user posted.\n\nThen there were the people who declared they love Panera mac and cheese anyway \u2014 and wondered what all the fuss was about.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how almost all chain restaurants cook and serve their food,\u201d one person commented. \u201cIt\u2019s called efficiency.\u201d\n\n\u201cOMG PANERA BREAD MAC AND CHEESE IS FROZEN??? I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!\u201d another joked, suggesting people were foolish to ever think the meal, listed online at $6.99 for a large bowl, was concocted on-site from scratch.\n\nThe item may be frozen, but it\u2019s also popular. Panera serves more than 3 million mac-and-cheese servings each month, according to the company.\n\nThe identity of the woman who posted the video is unclear, and she did not respond to an inquiry from The Post.\n\nHer latest tweets suggest a silver lining in the alleged firing, which has brought even more publicity: \u201csince it\u2019s blowing up again go follow my socials,\u201d she said Saturday.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow four dishes with roots in other lands tell a story of immigration\n\nWho says you can\u2019t eat red meat?
