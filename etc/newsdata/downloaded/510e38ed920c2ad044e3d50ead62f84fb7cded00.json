England were playing South Africa in the World Cup final and the Aussie coach had been up to his usual tricks.\n\nJohn Smit, who was Springboks captain at the time, remembers the first training session after Jones was drafted in to help head coach Jake White. 'We were doing a run-through and we thought it had gone pretty well,' Smit tells Sportsmail.\n\n'We got in a huddle and I said, 'Eddie, what do you think?' 'He said, 'Hmm, yeah mate, I reckon it's a four out of 10'.\n\nEddie Jones came into the South Africa set-up back in 2007 and lifted the standards\n\nJohn Smit (right) captained South Africa to victory over Johnny Wilkinson and England\n\n\u2018He raised our standards straight away. He was really good for us. He wasn\u2019t really the head coach, standing up in the front and talking. But he helped, he absorbed a bit of the pressure.\u2019\n\nSouth Africa had thrashed England in the pool stages, before meeting them again in the final five weeks later. England were overwhelming underdogs and lost 15-6. But Smit believes the balance of power has now firmly been flipped on its head.\n\n\u2018The only similarity is that it\u2019s the same countries,\u2019 Smit says. \u2018Everything else is different. Different playing styles, coaching styles, different journeys.\n\n\u2018In 2007, England were the underdogs because we\u2019d beaten them 36-0 five weeks earlier.\n\nSouth Africa were clearly the best side in the world when they beat England in France\n\n'It\u2019s hard to explain how big it would be for South Africa to win. I don\u2019t think anything can have a bigger effect on our country than a game like this. I never realised until I got back from Paris in 2007. All walks of life, all colours, all sizes, all languages, it\u2019s the most uniting tool we have as a country.\n\n\u2018Around 18 months ago, if you\u2019d offered any South Africa supporter a quarter-final, they would have bitten your arm off. On semi-final form, it\u2019s a game England would expect to win. You\u2019d be a brave man to put your money on South Africa.\u2019\n\nIn 2011, Smit moved to Saracens, where he witnessed the emergence of their golden generation including Owen Farrell, who he calls \u2018Faz\u2019, Maro Itoje and the Vunipola brothers. As a fellow hooker, Smit worked closely with Jamie George, and he believes the club\u2019s winning mentality will come to the fore this week.\n\n\u2018The spine of the English team is built around Saracens,\u2019 says Smit. \u2018They\u2019re well accustomed to these grand final scenarios.\n\nSmit played alongside Owen Farrell (left) at Saracens and was struck by his dedication\n\n\u2018Those guys were kids when I joined Saracens but they didn\u2019t come across as kids. They had built quite a bond in the academy and were motivated athletes who wanted to achieve.\n\n\u2018Eddie\u2019s been pretty fortunate to get these players at a time when Saracens are probably the strongest team in the world.\n\n\u2018Jamie George was one of the most co-operative students I\u2019ve ever come across. He was hungry to learn, to listen, to work. He is unbelievably well-balanced, carries well, has a huge work-rate, knows when to pop and when to hold. He\u2019s the complete No 2. It was obvious he was going to go all the way, like all those guys.\n\n\u2018Faz was a special player, the integral cog in that machine with the way he captains and manages the game.\u2019\n\nSmit believes Sarries and England play from similar blueprints. \u2018Watching the semi-final reminded me of one of those clinical Heineken Cup performances. They did more than just beat them up. They did them at the collision, but they also took risks and offloaded some balls. I can\u2019t see them deviating from that. If they get that right again, I don\u2019t see England not pulling through.\u2019\n\nSmit expects South Africa to continue with their simplistic style many have called boring\n\nNor does he think South Africa will deviate much from their \u2018boring\u2019 style. \u2018It\u2019s absolutely boring,\u2019 Smit says. \u2018But people must understand the journey of South Africa. Rassie Erasmus has had 18 months and he\u2019s got these guys to focus on their biggest strengths: their pack, increasing the physicality in defence and aligning that with a kicking game.\n\n\u2018South Africa have nothing pretty about them. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to work out how they play. The difficulty is trying to stop them. They don\u2019t care what people say about their style. It\u2019s not pretty. The 2007 final was probably the worst game of rugby ever played!\u2019\n\nAnd Smit \u2014 and Jones \u2014 know how that turned out.\n\nDove Men+Care are a proud partner to England Rugby and South Africa Rugby.
