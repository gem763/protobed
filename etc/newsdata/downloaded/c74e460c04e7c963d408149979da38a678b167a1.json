I shall be writing personal letters to people who are politically close to you and I hope they take appropriate action. Get out of my court.\"\n\nThe case had to be ended early and a retrial took place six months later, last October, when the victim had to go through the ordeal of giving evidence for a second time and the defendant, James Hackett, was found guilty and jailed for five years.\n\nUntil now the case could not be reported as Hackett was attempting to appeal against his conviction. However his request for an appeal has now not been granted.\n\nDespite the judge\u2019s promise to write letters to call for \"appropriate action\" to be taken Mr England was selected as an Assembly candidate that December.\n\nHe was praised by his former boss, Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns , in a press release welcoming his selection and describing the pair as \u201cfriends and colleagues\u201d.\n\nWe asked Mr Cairns whether he knew of the judge\u2019s attack and why he congratulated Mr England on his selection. Mr Cairns said he could not disclose employment records and did not go beyond that.\n\nIn response Mr England said: \"I was not told that anything had been ruled inadmissible prior to my testimony. I gave an honest answer, honouring the oath I took to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\"\n\nMr England was a witness at the trial of Hackett, 31, from Kingston upon Thames, for rape in April last year.\n\nBarristers for both the prosecution and defence had agreed there could be no mention of the sexual history of the victim, then in her early 20s.\n\nWithin minutes of taking his oath at the trial in April Mr England told the jury he had previously had a sexual relationship with the victim and said it had been \u201cgroup sex\u201d.\n\nThe prosecution barrister Marian Lewis told the court: \"He volunteered that he had had sexual intercourse with her previously, including group sex.\"\n\nThe judge replied: \"What on earth did he say that for?\" He told barristers he \"had to assume\" the jury had also heard England\u2019s comments.\n\nThe judge continued: \u201cThe previous sexual history, which I ruled inadmissible on the very point that [defence barrister] Miss [Ruth] Smith was trying to persuade me to allow in, has now emerged as a result of the totally off-script answer by this witness.\"\n\nHe said: \"It\u2019s obviously his intention to try and sabotage this trial.\"\n\nAs he spoke to the barristers about what should happen next the judge said asked both if they knew \u201canything about this man\u2019s political history, it doesn\u2019t make pleasant reading\u201d.\n\nIn front of the jury Judge Hopkins asked Mr England why he made the comments about past sexual relations with the victim. \"Why did you say that? Are you completely stupid?\" he said. Mr England responded: \"I apologise.\"\n\nWhen asked why he said it Mr England said he was answering the question.\n\nThe judge responded: \u201cNo it wasn\u2019t. It was quite clear what the question was. You have managed, singlehandedly, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trial. Mr England, as far as I am concerned, this matter so far as you are concerned isn\u2019t ended. I shall be writing personal letters to people who are politically close to you and I hope they take appropriate action. Get out of my court.\"\n\nThe judge said he did not believe the trial could go ahead, something described by prosecutor Ms Lewis as \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d.\n\nHackett was eventually convicted by majority verdict of a jury at Cardiff Crown Court.\n\nIn 2016 Mr England was suspended as an aide to Mr Cairns after tweeting that he told Remain campaigners to \"f*** off\".\n\nEarlier this year he was criticised for comments he made about people who voted Remain and Labour said his use of language raised concerns as to whether he was a fit and proper person to be a Conservative candidate.\n\nThe Conservative Party headquarters was asked if it was contacted about the comments made by the judge in relation to Mr England and who was notified.\n\nThey were also asked if any action had been, or will be, taken against Mr England.\n\nMr England declined to comment to two further questions which were whether he believed he was a suitable person to stand for election given the judge's criticism and whether he had been spoken to by the party in relation to the comments.\n\nMr Cairns was asked a list of questions including the dates at which Mr England was employed by him, with the date of the offence, trials and sentencing specified.\n\nHe was asked if he was aware of the court proceedings and whether he was contacted directly or indirectly by the judge.\n\nMr Cairns was also asked whether any action was taken with regards to Mr England and whether he knew about the judge's comments when he released a press release in December 2018 referring to Mr England as his \"colleague and friend\".\n\nIn response Mr Cairns said that was \"in the same way he does with candidates selected in Welsh constituencies\".\n\nHe said employment dates for employees cannot be released due to GDPR restrictions and that he did not receive any communication from the judge.\n\nWhen asked if he was aware of the court proceedings he responded: \"The investigation and court case proceeded in the normal way with all employees given the time, support, and space as necessary.\"\n\nAsked if any action was taken against Mr England he responded: \"As I received no communication from a judge, the court case proceeded in the normal way.\"", "description": "Welsh assembly candidate Ross England was accused by a judge of deliberately sabotaging the trial by trying to tell the jury about the victim's sexual history", "authors": ["Ruth Mosalski", "Mikey Smith"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758241.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THP_CHP_301019SLUG_7338JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
