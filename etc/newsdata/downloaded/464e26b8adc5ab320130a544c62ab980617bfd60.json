BTC But how?\n\nThe scammers have been using a trojanized version of an official Tor browser package. The bad browser redirects users to two websites which claim the user\u2019s version of Tor is out of date. Researchers say this happens even if the browser is the most up-to-date version.\n\nFake Tor browser\n\nWhen a user clicks on the \u201cupdate\u201d link on the nefarious page, they are redirected to another website where they are told they can download an update.\n\nESET says these websites and the malicious Tor browser was promoted in 2017 and early 2018 \u2013 during the infamous cryptocurrency bull run \u2013 on various Russian forums. The fake browser claimed to be the official Russian language version of Tor.\n\nThe scammers also used Pastebin accounts to promote their fake Tor websites, and encourage users to download the software to evade government surveillance. The associated Pastebin accounts have been viewed more than 500,000 times.\n\nWhen users of the infected browser went to add funds to their Bitcoin wallet or pay for items on dark web marketplaces, the browser would change the target wallet address to one controlled by the scammers.\n\nESET researchers identified three Bitcoin wallets used in this campaign. At the time of writing the wallets had received 4.8 BTC, about $40,000.\n\nFor all intent and purpose, the infected browser is exactly the same as the legitimate Tor browser, so there is little to suggest to the user that something might go awry.\n\nWhile using malware to switch out Bitcoin wallet addresses is nothing new, embedding that functionality in a browser is less common.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a savvy strategy, too. To access dark web marketplaces you must used Tor (The Onion Router). The cyberbaddies knew there\u2019s a high probability that Tor users will probably use Bitcoin aswell.\n\nIf there\u2019s something to be learned from this it\u2019s to always download software from legitimate sources and keep it up to date.", "description": "There's a malicious version of the Tor browser going round \u2013 the program used to access the dark web \u2013 and it's stealing user's Bitcoin.", "authors": ["Matthew Beedham", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Ftor-fake-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-blockchain-hack-scam-russia.jpg&signature=b6dc0497c9d3b235366212fcf4fb5637", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
