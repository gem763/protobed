The office is seeking the records from Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA.\n\nThe president\u2019s attorneys argue that a sitting president can\u2019t be subject to a criminal process while in office and want the federal court to declare the subpoena unconstitutional.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Justice Department asked Marrero to keep the case in federal court and temporarily block the subpoena while the case is argued. Attorneys for the department asserted there were \u201cserious constitutional issues at stake\u201d and that Congress and the Supreme Court \u201chave effectively already made clear that the type of claims the president has raised ought to be adjudicated in federal rather than state court.\u201d\n\nVance wants any litigation over the subpoena to be heard by a state court. New York has \u201ca sovereign right to enforce its criminal laws free from federal interference,\u201d lawyers in the D.A.\u2019s office argued in today\u2019s filing, and \"state proceedings do afford [Trump] an adequate opportunity to raise any constitutional claims.\"\n\nThey added that \u201cdelaying enforcement of the subpoena will likely result in the expiration of the statutes of limitations that would apply to some of the transactions at issue in the grand jury investigation.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2b/91/d97423c7472c8dee3c779593dc4e/19103-donald-trunmp-ap-773.jpg"}
