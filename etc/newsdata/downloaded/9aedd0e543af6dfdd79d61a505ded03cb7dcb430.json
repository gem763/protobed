The four-year contract stipulates that the women will receive equal win and draw bonuses as the men's team.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNow, national team captain Korpela has revealed details on how the deal was achieved, saying that the Finnish government played an indirect hand in proceedings.\n\nAfter the women's team spent years seeking equal compensation and conditions from their football association, as well as gaining the backing of the men's team and their player union, the government released a statement in May giving their view of affairs. Finland's Ombudsman for Equality, which is part of the Justice Ministry, said: \u201cEqualizing national team compensation would be a clear statement from the football association that women's and men's football are equally valuable and important.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom then on negotiations went smoothly,\u201d said Korpela. \u201cInitially the football association said that there was no money.\n\n\u201cWe learned that no one will offer anything for free. You have to stick by what you want and not give up. We didn\u2019t want to act difficult, because the football association had arranged a lot for us. But sometimes you need to be hard to get what you deserve. We did this for the future players as well, not only for the current team.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nKorpela said they were grateful for the support of the men\u2019s national team too: \u201cIt means so much to us that they are on our side. We also tried to convince the football association that equal treatment would mean positive publicity for them.\u201d\n\nFinland, the 31st ranked team in the world, joins Norway and New Zealand as women's teams granted equal conditions. Holland also have an agreement in place with their national federation, which says they will achieve equal pay to their male counterparts in 2023, but other women's national teams continue the fight.\n\nThe World Champion USA team are in a dispute with their federation over equal pay and are scheduled to take their case to court next May, after talks broke down last month, while Jamaica are threatening to boycott their Olympic qualifying games until they are paid the salaries they were contractually promised months ago.\n\n\u201cI am proud, but it is still weird that only these countries have an equal deal,\u201d Korpela said. \u201cWe are not talking about it enough, in some countries women cannot even play football.\u201d", "description": "Finland's women's football team became the latest national squad to strike an equal pay deal thanks to a government intervention, according to their captain and Everton's goalkeeper Tinja-Riikka Korpela.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5rK.U2VAdqPYhbIh3oUWpQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bhAwRpaCC5yA_fyUJxbs6Q--~B/aD0xNDU2O3c9MjMyNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/fd3e6bec53849284ff13891a9b51264e", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
