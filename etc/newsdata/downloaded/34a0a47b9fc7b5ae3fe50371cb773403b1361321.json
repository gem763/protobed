After opening questions related to the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump, the debate quickly turned to the health care reform plan backed by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nWarren again tried to reframe the question of whether she would raise middle-class taxes to pay for the plan. \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down,\u201d she said. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg, who last month called Warren \u201cextremely evasive\u201d on the tax question, pounced. \u201cNo plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in,\u201d he said, touting his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d proposal as a better alternative. \u201cI don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years,\u201d he said to Warren. \u201cWhy unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?\u201d\n\nWarren jabbed back at Buttigieg, saying his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan is really \u201cMedicare for All Who Can Afford It.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden and Amy Klobuchar, both of whom support building on the Affordable Care Act with a public option, also attacked Medicare for All as expensive and impractical. \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd we can get this public option done.\u201d\n\nSanders defended his plan \u2014 and opened the door for further attacks on Warren. \u201cAt the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar took the opportunity to criticize Warren again. \u201cAt least Bernie is being honest here, and saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.\u201d\n\nA political strategy: The attacks on Warren are widely seen as a sign that she\u2019s now the Democratic frontrunner \u2014 and they\u2019re likely a sign that, as tiresome as the repeated tax question might get, Warren is going to keep getting asked it by the media, Democratic rivals and Republicans. She\u2019s pointedly not willing to answer directly (or take the bait) and say that she will raise taxes, even as she continues to argue that overall costs under Medicare for All will go down for the middle class. Her caginess on the question suggests she thinks that higher taxes on the middle class, or the very word \u201ctaxes,\u201d might be toxic in an election campaign against Trump. But her dodging hasn\u2019t hurt her so far.\n\nWhat the polls say: The latest Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that 51% of those surveyed favor Medicare for All, while 47% oppose it. A majority of Democrats and about half of independents support a national Medicare-for-all plan, while more than 70% of Republicans oppose the idea. Suport for a public option is higher, at 73%. A CBS News poll released Tuesday found that 59% of voters believe that a government-run plan should \"compete with private insurance\" as under a public option, while 32% said they would want it to replace private insurance. But polls have also found that support for Medicare for All or other health plans can shift significantly depending on the arguments presented.\n\nThe bottom line: Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation reminds us that there is no simple answer to the question of ultimate costs, and that a wide variety of outcomes are possible depending on how Medicare for All is implemented. \u201cA Medicare for all plan could be designed so that many people, including those who are middle class, pay less in taxes than they are paying now in premiums, deductibles, and copays,\u201d Levitt tweeted Tuesday. \u201cIt depends entirely on the details.\u201d\n\nLike what you're reading?
