I am very pleased that we have succeeded in growing both our sales and our profits.\n\nPick n Pay, like its peers, has cut prices in order to attract highly cost-conscious shoppers and cope with the difficult trading conditions that have hit other retailers at home amid a sluggish economy.\n\nComparable group turnover grew 6%, with like-for-like sales growth of 2.9%.
