She also accused federal officials, including former leaders of the FBI, of a longstanding effort to frame President Donald Trump's former national security adviser and called for the entire prosecution team to be removed from the case.\n\n\"There is egregious government misconduct and longtime suppression of Brady material that should\u2019ve been provided to defense before there ever was a plea,\" Powell said during a hearing Tuesday, referring to a rule that requires the government to turn over evidence that could prove a defendant's innocence.\n\nU.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan did not seem receptive, asking Powell if the evidence she's accused the government of suppressing is materially \u2014 and not just theoretically \u2014 relevant. He also pressed Powell on what she meant by exonerating Flynn and whether the plea deal will be withdrawn.\n\n\"To show what, that he's innocent of this charge?\" Sullivan asked.\n\n\"To show that the entire prosecution should be dismissed,\" Powell said, citing \"egregious government misconduct\" and bias against Flynn.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn arrives for his sentencing at the U.S. District Court in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 18, 2018. More\n\nThe former Army general was among the first in the president's orbit to be charged as part of former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. His sentencing in Washington has been delayed for nearly a year to allow him to finish his cooperation with prosecutors. Though both parties agree that that cooperation is over, they have been at a deadlock on how to proceed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Brandon Van Grack pushed for a sentencing date later this year and left open the possibility that prosecutors will seek prison time. Powell said \"there is far more at stake here than sentencing,\" alleging that evidence, including memos and portions of infamous text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, have been withheld and would've exonerated Flynn from allegations that he's a Russian agent.\n\nVan Grack said Flynn was never accused of being an agent of Russia, and the charge he pleaded guilty to was lying to federal investigators. He also said Flynn was well aware of the Strzok and Page text messages, including the ones that were not available to the public, before he pleaded guilty.\n\nFlynn's cooperation with prosecutors involved testifying against his former business associate who was accused of secretly lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government. But prosecutors called into question Flynn's cooperation shortly before he was supposed to testify at the July trial of his former business partner in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nDays before Bijan Rafiekian's trial was supposed to begin, prosecutors said they will not call Flynn to the stand and, instead, labeled their former star witness a \"co-conspirator\" in the case. Flynn's defense team pushed back against the \"co-conspirator\" designation, calling the government's new position about Flynn's status \"disingenuous\" and was not based on any new evidence, according to court filings. Defense attorneys also claimed that the government's sudden \"about-face\" could be a \"retaliation\" because prosecutors were not satisfied with his testimony.", "description": "Michael Flynn's attorney accused the government of withholding evidence as prosecutors push for sentencing date.", "authors": ["Kristine Phillips", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Vk9Wu3A6z8uoAGB42tdU6w--~B/aD0yNDgxO3c9MzM1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/353e77f0e55ad5bd3a0fb8efe80b5966", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
