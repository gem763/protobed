Trump had to drop the nomination after it emerged that Ratcliffe had exaggerated his national security credentials in his biography, wrongly claiming he had conducted prosecutions in terrorist financing cases.\n\nDespite the collapse of the Ratcliffe nomination, Gordon was forced out. She was reported to have been holding a meeting on election security on 8 August when Coats interrupted to convince her that she would have to resign.\n\nPompeo subpoenaed over Ukraine documents as US envoy steps down Read more\n\nIn a terse handwritten note to the president, Gordon said: \u201cI offer this letter as an act of respect and patriotism, not preference. You should have your team.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the DNI (ODNI) and its inspector general has the authority to receive whistleblower complaints from across all US intelligence agencies and determine whether they should be referred to Congress.\n\n\u201cWe all knew Coats\u2019 departure was coming because he had clashed with the president on several issues. What was weird was the president\u2019s forcefulness in not wanting Sue Gordon to take over as acting director,\u201d said Katrina Mulligan, a former official who worked in the ODNI, the national security council, and the justice department.\n\n\u201cI was hearing at the time that Sue was getting actively excluded from things by the president that she would ordinarily have taken part in, and she was being made to feel uncomfortable,\u201d said Mulligan, now managing director for national security and international policy at the Center for American Progress.\n\n\u201cAnd then the president tried to install someone who was clearly unqualified,\u201d she added. \u201cNow the timeline of the whistleblower in the White House raises a lot of questions about the Sue Gordon piece of this.\u201d\n\nJohn McLaughlin, the former acting CIA director, said the fact that Ratcliffe\u2019s nomination was dropped and the job of acting DNI ultimately went to an intelligence professional, Robert Maguire, was a sign that the intelligence community was so far resisting political pressure from the White House.\n\nMaguire faced tough questioning in Congress this week about his initial refusal, on justice department guidance, to refer the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\n\u201cOn politicisation, my sense is that the community is holding the line against it although undoubtedly dealing with more or less constant pressure,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cI felt kind of bad for the acting DNI, an honourable man with impeccable service to the nation. I believe he made some honest errors in judgment rather than yielding to political pressure. Throwing him into this job in these circumstances on such short notice is a little like assigning me on a navy Seal mission.\u201d", "description": "The president removed Dan Coats days after his conversation with Zelenskiy and insisted that Coats\u2019s deputy not get the job", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d24554e54c0cc80a0eb640c7da6fc6b9f41c886/209_650_5104_3062/master/5104.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=710b6b3c89a1c50b875bc9bcd0497505", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
