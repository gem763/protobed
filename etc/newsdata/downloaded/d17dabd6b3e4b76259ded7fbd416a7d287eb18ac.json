Mr. Munthe and his fellow archers seek out the natural arches that abound in the Southwest and other craggy corners of the world. Composed mostly of sandstone or limestone, an arch forms when weaker sediment disintegrates and leaves a semicircular fin of harder material around it.\n\nMany of the finds are dutifully logged into the World Arch Database, which lists 9,316 arches, 49% of them in Utah. Mr. Munthe takes credit for more than 700 finds, making him one of the more prolific contributors.\n\nJens Munthe, arch hunter Photo: Jim Carlton/The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe little-known world of arch hunting is starting to come into the light as the popularity of arches has grown. A website containing a database of arches he and a partner, Adiyan Haran, have cataloged in southwestern Utah has amassed 142,200 page views since it went online in 2012. Arches National Park in eastern Utah, where many visit specifically to see the natural phenomena, drew 1.7 million visitors last year, up 71% from a decade earlier.\n\nBut the newfound publicity is exposing chasms in the arching world. Archers disagree about everything from how to measure an arch to how to classify one. Messrs. Haran and Munthe even have a continuing dispute on a central question: Should people ever be included in an arch photo for scientific display?\n\nMr. Munthe thinks it\u2019s necessary to show the scale of an arch. Mr. Haran believes it\u2019s an unnecessary concession to the digital world: \u201cThe social internet thing I feel is nothing more than a cesspool.\u201d Mr. Munthe still hands him photos of people in his arches to post on their website. \u201cI just paint them out with the computer,\u201d Mr. Haran says.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fracas over measurements. Messrs. Munthe and Haran are from the school of fiberglass measuring tape, which they like to unspool across the span of an arch\u2014sometimes by walking oh-so-carefully across it.\n\nBut others believe tape is imprecise and prefer laser range finders.\n\nThe North Window Arch in Arches National Park near Moab, Utah.

Fiddling around with the Google Earth map application, he spotted an intriguing formation in remote Guangxi province, China. He estimated the length of the object, known locally as Fairy Bridge, at 300 feet. It was only a year later when an NABS group inspected the structure in person\u2014a journey that included a three-hour raft trip\u2014that the arch officially went into the record books at 400 feet.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of what constitutes an arch type. The NABS lists 17 types including the \u201cwaterfall natural bridge\u201d and the \u201cbuttress natural arch.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Is it cheating to look for natural arches on Google Earth? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Munthe goes by just 11, including the \u201calcove\u201d and \u201cexpanded crevice,\u201d as described in a book he reveres by the late geologist Dale Stevens, who helped document the more than 2,000 arches in Arches National Park.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to sit down in a committee and hash out a consensus,\u201d Mr. Munthe says. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for that.\u201d\n\nDirectors of the arch society say they can\u2019t make people follow their guidelines. \u201cThese are the only classifications that have been developed by a group of experts rather than one or two individuals, so, yes, we would prefer that people use them instead of inventing their own,\u201d says the group\u2019s webmaster, David Brandt-Erichsen.\n\nOne thing almost everybody can agree on: You have to find an arch before you can argue about it. That\u2019s what Mr. Munthe has spent much of his free time doing since retiring 24 years ago from a career following oil fields around the globe.\n\nHe and his wife, Kathy, settled in tiny Escalante (pop. 802) and began exploring the numerous surrounding canyons. A fan of arches since boyhood, Mr. Munthe called the NABS for suggestions of ones to see in his area.\n\n\u201cThey knew of 50, but I found about 100 the first month,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I was kind of into it.\u201d\n\nPerseverance Arch is known as a buttress type. Photo: David Kennedy\n\nBoth Mr. Munthe and his wife started finding arches almost everywhere they went. By 2002, he had written a book on 630 arches found in and around the surrounding Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, mostly by him and his wife.\n\nHe showed his arch finding know-how on a hike along the Escalante River in early September. Pointing up at a hole in a cliff, he says, \u201cThere\u2019s an arch. You can tell by the telltale opening of sunlight on the cliff.\u201d\n\nNear the end of his four-mile trek, Mr. Munthe has yet to find a new arch but has come across some more leads. He pulls to a stop on the trail and stares at another hole in a distant canyon wall. \u201cThat sure looks like it could be an arch,\u201d he says under his breath, using binoculars to take a closer look. \u201cAt first, you think it\u2019s a shadow but that\u2019s going in 6 feet or so.\u201d\n\nHe holsters his binoculars and continues toward his Subaru, saying: \u201cI\u2019ll get to that one next time.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com", "description": "Controversies abound in the world of natural-arch hunters: Are there 11 categories or 17?
