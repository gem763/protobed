The European Union and the International Monetary Fund shared the Obama administration\u2019s view of Shokin as corrupt.\n\nTrump faces an impeachment inquiry over a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which, partly based on information passed to him by Giuliani, he asked the foreign leader to investigate Biden.\n\nVolker presented text message conversations among U.S. government officials that seemed to back the view by some Democrats that Trump was pushing for Zelensky\u2019s cooperation in exchange for releasing military aid that had been appropriated by Congress but sequestered.\n\nKurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, arrives for a closed-door interview with House investigators, Oct. 3, 2019.

The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\n\n\u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text,\u201d Sondland added.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported Thursday that Trump ordered the removal of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch after Giuliani complained that she was hindering efforts to launch an investigation of Biden. Yovanovitch is scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Oct. 11.\n\nAsked about the recall of Yovanovitch on Thursday, Trump responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I recalled her or somebody recalled her but I heard very, very bad things about her for a long period of time. Not good.\u201d\n\nEarlier Thursday, Trump himself had publicly repeated his call for Ukraine to investigate Biden, adding China to the countries whose help he is actively seeking in what Giuliani has boasted is an effort to discredit a likely opponent of Trump\u2019s reelection bid.\n\n\u201cThey should investigate the Bidens because how does a company that\u2019s newly formed and all these companies, and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday. \u201cSo I would say with President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend they start an investigation into the Bidens, because nobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked.\u201d\n\nEllen Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Committee, issued a statement Thursday noting that soliciting assistance in a federal election from noncitizens, let alone foreign governments, is against the law.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker testified that he tried to warn the president's personal lawyer that the stories he was being fed about Joe Biden were not trustworthy.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.Qs_qNHVeosOr.DdjX2.hw--~B/aD0yMTIyO3c9MzE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/253c9b40-e628-11e9-bff5-0411c3858fb9", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
