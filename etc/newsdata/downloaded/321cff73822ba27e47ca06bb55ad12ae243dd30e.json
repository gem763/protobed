They eventually agreed, by a 7-3 vote, to trim its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1.75% and 2%. That was the second straight meeting with a rate cut.\n\nA couple of Fed officials said they thought rate cuts might \u201chelp forestall\u201d layoffs.\n\nDuring the deliberations, many officials thought the Fed should stand still and await further developments.\n\n\u201cThey contended that the key uncertainties were unlikely to be resolved anytime soon,\u201d the minutes said.\n\nOnly two Fed officials wanted an aggressive half percentage point cut which they said would reduce the risk of an economic downturn.\n\nThe minutes said little new about the plans by policy makers for future rate cuts. The central bank will meet again on Oct. 31. Only seven of 17 officials had backed another cut by the end of the year, according to their \u201cdot-plot\u201d interest rate projections.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday the central bank was operating on a meeting-by-meeting basis and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\n\nInvestors have little doubt the Fed will cut interest rates again after their Oct. 29-30 meeting. The probability of a rate cut is now slightly above 80%, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool. The odds of an easing jumped after the ISM manufacturing sector data was published last week.\n\nAccording to the minutes, officials discussed the strains in the short-term money markets that many analysts have tied to the Fed\u2019s program to shrink its balance sheet.\n\nBut the discussion in the minutes is now a bit stale since Powell announced Tuesday that the Fed would \u201csoon\u201d start expanding the size of its balance sheet by purchasing short-term Treasury bills.\n\nOne important note, not mentioned by Powell, was that \u201cseveral\u201d officials supported consideration of a \u201cstanding repurchase agreement facility\u201d to combat future market volatility from a lack of short-term liquidity. Many economists think such a program could be up and running by early 2020.\n\nStocks DJIA, +0.78% were higher after the minutes were published on Wednesday on hopes of progress in U.S. and China trade talks.\n\nSee also: Powell says economic expansion can last, but there are risks", "description": "Federal Reserve officials grew more worried about the U.S. economy in September, according to minutes of their meeting released Wednesday.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS928_powell_ZG_20191009091030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
