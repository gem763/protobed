'I started to go back to our car as I realised we had left everything, including the car keys, in there. 'Unbeknown to me the driver had started heading back and then smashed into our car,' Kirsty said\n\n'It's a lot of trauma and we just want to get justice for what has happened.\n\n'It was all over road rage. This was crazy and he came after us.\n\n'I am worried that these guys are still out there.\n\n'It gives me nightmares. I am scared to go out in the car. What happened to us was unimaginable.'\n\nThe family, driving in their red Audi A3, had just been visiting Kirsty's mum in Wyke, Bradford, when they were cut up at a crossing by the young driver, aged around 21 - 24.\n\n'We were at a set of traffic lights with two lanes, we were going straight ahead, the other driver was in the lane to turn right, but as we set off the driver tried to pull into our lane,' said Kirsty.\n\nCCTV footage shows the terrifying moment the angry unnamed driver of a Seat Leon aimed his car directly at Kirsty's vehicle - smashing into the passenger side of their vehicle at speed\n\n'It was impossible to let them in without a crash, we had to keep going forward and all hell broke loose.\n\n'We pulled over with the other driver pulling in front of us, Charlie and the other guy were arguing and shouting.\n\n'I thought they were going to reverse back into our car so I got out of the car and stood in front to stop them, this put it to an end and we went about our separate ways.'\n\nKirsty and her family then went shopping in Brighouse and had returned back to Bradford an hour later to pick her other kids, Chloe, 11, and Ethan, six, up from school when they saw them again.\n\n'Those drivers used their car as a weapon. It was so scary that it got out of control like that. 'The car (pictured) rocked from the massive impact. It was terrifying,' Kirsty said. They reported the incident to West Yorkshire Police, who are currently investigating\n\nThis time the car was in front of them at a junction on Wibsey Park Avenue.\n\n'We were behind the guys at a junction and we noticed it was them. They went to reverse into us so we all jumped out of the car,' said Kirsty.\n\n'Charlie went to their car to try and take the keys from the driver to stop them but they managed to grab hold of him and started driving up the road with him.\n\n'He managed to break free and the car reversed into him but he managed to jump out of the way, instead the car hit a gate.\n\n'I then started to go back to our car as I realised we had left everything, including the car keys, in there.\n\n'Unbeknown to me the driver had started heading back and then smashed into our car.\n\nHousewife Kirsty (pictured) was rushed to hospital where her wound was stitched and she was left eating and drinking through a straw for four days last month. She now fears she may have to have her front teeth removed as a result of nerve damage\n\n'They hit the open door, which smacked into my face.\n\n'I do not know how my jaw wasn't broken. The pain was crushing.\n\n'Charlie was also on his way back to the car and he managed to jump out of the way again, Keaton was also on his way back but luckily he was not in their path.\n\n'This so very easily could have been a murder investigation.\n\n'Those drivers used their car as a weapon. It was so scary that it got out of control like that.\n\n'The car rocked from the massive impact. It was terrifying.'\n\nThey reported the incident to West Yorkshire Police, who are currently investigating.\n\nKirsty and Charlie turned detective and conducted their own enquiries to uncover CCTV footage to find the culprits.\n\nThey put out their own appeal on Facebook and got a shocking response from viewers.\n\nA spokeswoman for West Yorkshire Police said: 'We are aware of the incident and enquiries are ongoing.'", "description": "Kirsty Greenman, 32,\u00a0was struck in the face by her own car door which cut her lip and ripped the gums from her teeth.
