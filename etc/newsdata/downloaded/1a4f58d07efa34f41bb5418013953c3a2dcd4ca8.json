REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nThe raid could not have come at a better time for Trump, who is facing an impeachment investigation by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives who say his attempt to persuade Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden was an abuse of power and may have put national security at risk.\n\nHe has also come under withering criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike for an abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria, which cleared the way for a Turkish invasion against America\u2019s Kurdish allies in the area.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it alters the trajectory of our politics in any way necessarily, but without question, for the president it\u2019s a huge win. There\u2019s no other way to spin it,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, a Hoover Institution scholar who advised Republican Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nTrump, who is up for re-election in November 2020, will be able to trumpet the successful raid on the campaign trail as another reason why he should not be thrown out of office, in addition to his tough stance on illegal immigration and his record on the economy.\n\nHe could not help but tease the win in a typically grandiose fashion: \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d he tweeted on Saturday night, apparently only minutes after U.S. special forces had safely landed back at their base.\n\nAware of the political capital suddenly at his disposal, Trump delivered the news on Sunday from the White House Diplomatic Reception Room standing before battle flags that had been brought from the Oval Office for the occasion.\n\nTrump offered vivid and sometimes grisly details about the raid and Baghdadi\u2019s demise, which he claimed was \u201cbigger\u201d than the 2011 U.S. killing of al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden.\n\nAfterwards, the White House deployed top national security aides to the Sunday talk shows to discuss the raid and its importance for national security.\n\nThe news prompted an outpouring of praise from senior Republicans, including those such as close Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham who had strongly criticized the president\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria.\n\n\u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d Graham told reporters during a second briefing at the White House. \u201cThis is a moment where we should all be proud of our American military and our intelligence community. This is a moment where President Trump\u2019s worst critics should say, \u2018well done Mr. President.\u2019\u201d\n\nSenate majority leader Republican Mitch McConnell, who also strongly condemned the troop withdrawal, said on Sunday he applauded the news and was grateful \u201cto President Trump and his team for their leadership.\u201d\n\nEven Senator Mitt Romney, Trump\u2019s fiercest Republican critic, took to Twitter to thank the President for sending Baghdadi to \u201chell.\u201d\n\nSPEAKER BRIEFING\n\nThe good news brought only a brief truce with Democrats who hope to beat Trump in 2020 if they cannot remove him from office via impeachment, however.\n\nSeveral senior Democrats, including Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, congratulated Trump.\n\nBut many were quick to point out that Baghdadi\u2019s death did not put an end to Islamic State and that Trump had no strategy for the region. They also called out the president for breaking with tradition by failing to brief the full \u201cGang of Eight\u201d Congressional leaders ahead of the raid.\n\nTrump pointedly said on Sunday that he did not tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, his chief Democratic rival who has played a leading role in the impeachment drama, about the plan because of concerns the information would leak and put American soldiers at risk.\n\n\u201cThe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top congressional leadership were notified of in advance, and on the administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement in which she praised the armed forces.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe takedown of Baghdadi is unlikely to distract lawmakers from the impeachment probe, which has gained momentum following a number of damaging witness testimonies which Republicans are increasingly struggling to rebut.\n\nSpeaking to reporters following a top U.S. diplomat\u2019s closed-door testimony on Wednesday, John Thune, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, said the picture emerging from the investigation was \u201cnot a good one,\u201d a possible sign that Republican support for Trump might be faltering.\n\n\u201cIn years past you could see how this would pause the political rhetoric for at least a few days,\u201d said the Hoover Institution\u2019s Chen. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening this time.\u201d", "description": "For President Donald Trump, the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is a signature achievement that may help quell growing criticism from his own ranks, but it is unlikely to offer much relief from Democratic-led scrutiny of his dealings with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445638658&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0UH", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
