Even French winemakers accept that our bubbly is worthy of respect, with Taittinger and Pommery going as far as buying vineyards here.\n\nAnd with all this growing interest, British wine tourism is taking off. At dozens of venues around the country you can wander around the vineyards, visit the wineries, take part in tastings and often have a delicious lunch or dinner. Some offer accommodation, too.
