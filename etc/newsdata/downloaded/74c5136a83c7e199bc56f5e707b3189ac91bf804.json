Yaaaay!!! You have gotten me to the 12 million!!! A needle for health and well-being representing each million of you,' she said in her post.\n\nThat influencer life! Salma Hayek took to her social channel on Monday morning to share a photo of herself getting acupuncture in honor of reaching 12 million followers\n\nThe Oscar nominated actress is pretty active on her Instagram as she shares throwbacks from past roles, special appearances, and of course her lavish vacations.\n\nShe also uses her platform for good and is constantly speaking out about political issues around the world.\n\nBack in August she took to her Instagram in Spanish to share a touching message about an act of violence in her home country of Mexico writing: 'I am very saddened that in my Coatzacoalcos, where I grew up with freedom that gives a united community and without violence, last night at least 25 people died in a bar attack. Unfortunately this is one of the countless misfortunes that happen daily in Mexico. We hope the authorities will deliver on their promise to stop the violence. It's time for so much suffering to end in a country that has it all.'\n\nLooking fab! Salma gave a fierce look as she posed during the front row of the Saint Laurent show at Paris Fashion Week at the end of September\n\nBut that's not all of the good that this Hollywood elite member and her husband Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault try to put into the world.\n\nBack in April, the Notre Dame Cathedral burned down in a tragic fire that left millions devastated. But the French billionaire and his father rose up and offered to donate $109 million dollars to help rebuild the historic landmark.\n\nAnd earlier this month, it became official when he and his father Francois Pinault signed over their donation to the Archdiocese of Paris.\n\nMaking change: Salma and Francois-Henri Pinault smile at the EE British Academy Film Awards back in February of 2018\n\nJust hours after the fire, Salma's longtime husband made the announcement that he would be donating to help the cause in hopes that others would follow in his lead.\n\n'It is certainly vulgar to make a gesture and then promote it, but the idea was to generate others,' he said during an interview with Bloomberg at the time.\n\nWith numerous donations received to help rebuild the monument, Paris has set sights to have the new build completed in five years just in time for them to host the 2024 Olympics.\n\nTogether: Salma and her husband attend the funeral of the former french President Jacques Chirac back at the end of September\n\nThe two love birds tied the knot back in 2009 in the City Hall of the Sixth Arrondissement in Paris.\n\nThey announced their engagement back in March of 2007 and just months later they welcomed their daughter, Valentina, 12, who was born in Los Angeles.\n\nPinault is the CEO of PBR and his father is one of France's richest men with an estimated net worth of $16.9 billion dollars.", "description": "Salma Hayek has reached a milestone on her Instagram.
