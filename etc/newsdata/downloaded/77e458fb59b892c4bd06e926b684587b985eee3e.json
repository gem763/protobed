Trace McSorley left. Another good running back in Miles Sanders was drafted. And how did the Nittany Lions respond? By becoming one of the best defenses in the nation on their way to a perfect 8-0 record. Penn State ranks in the top 10 in total yards and second in points allowed at just under 10 per contest. While on offense the combination of Sean Clifford and KJ Hamler has been electric.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAs a result, the Nittany Lions have jumped to 16/1 to win the national championship. That puts them in the second tier of contenders with the likes of Georgia (12/1), Oregon (30/1) and Florida (40/1). Alabama and Ohio State lead the way at 5/2, followed by Clemson at 3/1 and LSU at 6/1.\n\nThe Nittany Lions now head into a bye before a big matchup with Minnesota next week. If they can win that one, you can expect their title odds to keep improving before the game that will likely decide the winner of the Big Ten East (and maybe much more) when they travel to the Horseshoe to take on Ohio State on Nov. 23.\n\nFALLER: OKLAHOMA SOONERS (9/2 TO 18/1)\n\nDid you hear that? That was the door slamming on the Big 12\u2019s College Football Playoff chances. This was a down year for the Big 12 to begin with, and after Oklahoma\u2019s shocking 48-41 loss at Kansas State as 23.5-point road favorites this past weekend. And it\u2019s not like the Wildcats were some sort of offensive juggernaut that could go blow-for-blow with the Sooners, they rank 88th in total offense. As a result, the Sooners title odds took a nice hit, moving down to 18/1 and it could actually be worse than that.\n\nStory continues\n\nA one-loss Big 12 champion will need to get some help to get into the CFP. With the way things are going it looks like two SEC teams will get in, Clemson is set barring a loss, and even a one-loss Big Ten champion likely has the edge over Oklahoma. But even then, that means Ohio State needs to lose. Heck, if Oregon runs the table on their way to a Pac-12 title, they could be ahead of the Sooners. Oklahoma also has a tough schedule down the stretch, with games remaining against Iowa State, at Baylor, TCU and at Oklahoma State. Oklahoma\u2019s title odds have as much value as the Sooner Schooner at this point.\n\nHEISMAN\n\nBurrow actually became the favorite to be named college football\u2019s most outstanding player last week, but with this article on hiatus we thought it would be best to catch up. Burrow has moved from 3/1 to 6/5 to even money over the last three weeks. That\u2019s due to two factors. One: Burrow has been outstanding. In the last three weeks against Auburn, at Mississippi State and against Florida, Burrow has thrown for 941 yards while completing a crazy good 80.6 percent of his passes with eight touchdowns to just one interception. That\u2019s against two of the better defenses in the country.\n\nThe other factor is obviously the injury to Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa. Tua got hurt in the first half of the Tide\u2019s game against Tennessee and missed last week\u2019s game versus Arkansas. Both teams have a bye this week, before arguably the game of the year as they face off in Tuscaloosa in Week 11. If Tua can play in this game, he has plenty of value to win the Heisman, currently at 4/1. Heisman voters routinely fall victim to recency bias, so whomever preforms better and or wins this game will have a leg up when it comes to winning the award.\n\nDespite Oklahoma\u2019s loss, Jalen Hurts is still a contender for the award at 7/4.\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough few weeks for Wisconsin. A shocking upset loss at Illinois, followed by this weekend\u2019s beatdown at the hands of Ohio State. The Buckeyes continue to show they are just at another level compared to everyone else in the Big Ten. The Ohio State defense led by Chase Young (now on the board himself at 20/1) limited Taylor to just 52 yards on 20 attempts (2.6 yards per carry) and kept him out of the end zone last week. It was the third lowest rushing out of his career and his lowest in almost exactly a calendar year. With Wisconsin all but out of the race for the Big Ten West division, Taylor\u2019s hopes for the Heisman have all but disappeared.", "description": "We take a look at the risers and fallers in the college football national title and Heisman trophy odds heading into Week 10.
