USA TODAY\n\nThe NBA has had a bad week.\n\nThe fallout from a pro-Hong Kong tweet continued Thursday. Yes, the preseason game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets was played in Shanghai, but under muted circumstances. The NBA\u2019s message of a global game creating goodwill was missing.\n\nPress conferences for commissioner Adam Silver and both teams were canceled, advertising was scrubbed from the court and from arena signs, promotional material was removed from city buildings, and of course, the only people who saw the game in China were those in attendance because CCTV declined to air the game on TV or the Internet.\n\nMaking the situation worse was Yao Ming\u2019s conspicuous absence from the game in his hometown. A person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports that Yao, the former player for the Houston Rockets and Basketball Hall of Famer who is the president of the Chinese Basketball Association and is tight with Silver, was not even in Shanghai, and has not met with Silver in China. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the sensitive situation.\n\nIts longstanding and lucrative relationship with China fractured, the league was criticized in the United States for its initial ambiguous statement that tried to mollify China while supporting Rockets general manager Daryl Morey for his tweet.\n\nIt left Silver in an unenviable position, and he has navigated the fallout with a convincing statement about the league\u2019s beliefs and values about free speech. And while Silver is expected to attend Saturday's Lakers-Nets game in Shenzhen, the final stop during this preseason global tour, it is not known if he and Yao will meet as previously reported.\n\nThe best thing that can happen for the NBA now is to return to the United States as Silver and the league continue to try to mend fences. Perhaps then coaches and players like LeBron James, who makes annual trips to China and has a lifetime deal with Nike, will speak publicly about the matter. We'll see about that.\n\nThe entire week \u2013 starting with Morey\u2019s tweet, continuing with Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta\u2019s rebuke of Morey\u2019s tweet, Silver\u2019s forceful comments and the playing of the game \u2013 has been an eye-opener for those who aren\u2019t immersed in China\u2019s political and business operations.\n\nOPINION: China's business bullying jumps to new heights over tweet by Rockets GM\n\nA fan drapes a Chinese national flag over an NBA banner during a preseason game between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers in Shanghai. (Photo: AP)\n\nThe incident illuminated for a much larger audience the issues facing global businesses trying to do business with communist China and its heavy-handed, one-sided tactics \u2013 economic bullying.\n\nThis is what companies, including ones in the U.S., have to do if they want to cash in on China, despite its history of human rights abuses. The stories about acquiescing to China\u2019s demands have been around, but they\u2019ve been piled together this week to give a clear look at what businesses are willing to do.\n\nMany have taken issue with the NBA\u2019s willingness to do business in China, but there will not be a widespread withdrawal of U.S. businesses from China. The money is too good.\n\nThe situation this week should bring the topic into a broader discussion about what role the U.S. should play in China, Syracuse professor John Wolohan, who specializes in sports law and U.S.-China sports relations, told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nSome of the NBA criticism aimed at the league is fair; some is misguided. The NBA is willing to forego some \u2013 perhaps all? \u2013 of China\u2019s money, and Silver said those are the consequences he may have to accept.\n\nPRO-HONG KONG: Preseason NBA game draws supporters\n\nTRUMP ON NBA: President criticizes Steve Kerr, Gregg Popovich for 'pandering' to China\n\nOPINION: NBA draws its own line in the sand\n\nNBA revenue from China -- and a conservative estimate puts that at $500 million annually based on deals that are publicly known -- is part of basketball-related income which is split 50-50 between players and owners. Are owners and players willing to take a hit on salaries? What about the lucrative shoe deals players have related to China that could disappear?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, including the holier-than-thou criticism of the NBA. Do we have any idea how affordable some goods are because they are made cheaply in China? Your phone, TV, computer, clothes, sneakers, etc. \u2013 where are they made? What are you willing to sacrifice to denounce China?\n\nEven though it wasn\u2019t the NBA\u2019s intention in China, it gave us a lot to think about today and moving forward.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "description": "The Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets played in China, but under\u00a0muted circumstances.
