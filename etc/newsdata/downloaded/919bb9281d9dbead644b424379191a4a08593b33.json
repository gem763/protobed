Fifty-seven percent of black Democrats and 63% of Hispanic Democrats said the same.\n\nAbout two years ago, Engelhardt said he also noticed another major shift.\n\n\u201cStarting about 2016 \u2026 white liberals actually rate non-white groups more positively than they do whites,\u201d explained Engelhardt. \u201cUsually, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d\n\nMost racial groups feel more warmly about their own race compared to other races. That\u2019s true for every group, except white liberals, according to the American National Election Study.", "description": "", "authors": ["Npr.Org How-White-Liberals-Became-Woke-Radically-Changing-Their-Outlook-On-Race"], "top_image": ""}
