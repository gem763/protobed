USA TODAY\n\nCHICAGO -- Mitchell Trubisky is back at quarterback for the Chicago Bears.\n\nTrubisky was greeted with cheers when he trotted onto the field and threw a couple of warm-up passes before Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints. His return was expected after he practiced every day this week.\n\n\"He's very close,\" Bears coach Matt Nagy said Friday. \"I feel more comfortable right now than I did on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, yesterday. He has stacked good days together.\"\n\nTrubisky injured his non-throwing (left) shoulder three weeks ago during the first series against the Minnesota Vikings. He accompanied the Bears to London for their Oct. 6 game against the Oakland Raiders, but did not play.\n\nBears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky warms before the game against the Saints on Sunday as he returns from an injury.

Chicago ranks near the bottom of the league in almost every significant offensive statistic, and it cannot afford to fall even further behind in the NFC North.", "description": "The Chicago Bears lost to the Oakland Raiders two weeks ago with Mitchell Trubisky on the sidelines with an injury to his non-throwing shoulder.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published P.M.
