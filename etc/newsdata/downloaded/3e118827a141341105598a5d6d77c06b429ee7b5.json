Remember we talked about that?\" Gauff asked the tennis star.\n\n\"Take your mind to another place, take yourself to a practice match, just play. Don't think about negatives, just think about positives,\" Gauff told his daughter.\n\nHe also added that Coco Gauff was in a strong position to win the match, assuming she could mentally remove herself from the pressure of the situation in order to remain calm and trust her skills to defeat her opponent. \"You're right where we want to be,\" he says on the video released by Eurosport.", "description": "15-year-old Coco Gauff became the youngest woman to win a WTA title since 2004 on Sunday.
