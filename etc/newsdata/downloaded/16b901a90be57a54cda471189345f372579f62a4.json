(AP) - Arizona State\u2019s Eno Benjamin slipped into an open area across the middle, sprinted past a defender and into the end zone for a long fourth-quarter touchdown.\n\nUntil that big play, the Sun Devils seemed bogged down in the desert sand, unable to get out of their own way.\n\nStruggling against an FCS opponent wasn\u2019t exactly what they had in mind for a Top 25 tuneup.\n\nBenjamin caught a 72-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter, Cristian Zendejas kicked four field goals and Arizona State labored to a 19-7 win over Sacramento State on Friday night.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t play offense on our heels,\u201d Arizona State coach Herm Edwards said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it looked like a lot of tonight.\u201d\n\nArizona State (2-0) overcame inexperience - 25 freshmen saw action - with a convincing 30-7 opening win against Kent State.\n\nThe Sun Devils saw Friday night\u2019s game as a chance to clean up a few things with a road game against No. 19 Michigan State next.\n\nInstead, they had a few growing pains against the Hornets (1-1) after beating them 55-0 in the teams\u2019 only other meeting.\n\nArizona State\u2019s offense sputtered, plagued by off-target passes, drops and an ineffective running game against a team ranked 115th in total defense last season - in the FCS.\n\n\u201cAs an offense, I really didn\u2019t feel like we played to the standard we set as an offense,\u201d said Arizona State\u2019s Jayden Daniels, who threw for 304 yards and a touchdown on 17-of-27 passing.\n\nArizona State\u2019s defense was solid until the Hornets seemed to find something in the fourth quarter. Kevin Thomson hit Pierre Williams on a 40-yard pass, then found Tao McClinton on a 9-yard TD that pulled the Hornets within 12-7, giving themselves at least a shot at the upset.\n\n\u201cOur guys played hard,\u201d Sac State coach Troy Taylor said. \u201cThey hung in the game and had a chance to win it at the end. I am proud of how our guys prepared and how they competed.\u201d\n\nArizona State struggled before finally getting a spark early in the second quarter, when Brandon Aiyuk returned a punt 38 yards to Sac State\u2019s 9. A touchdown seemed imminent when A.J. Carter caught a pass from Daniels, but he fumbled just before crossing into the end zone and the Hornets recovered.\n\nThe Sun Devils had another good opportunity when their defense stopped Sac State on a fourth-and-1 from its own 33-yard line.\n\nThey botched that, too.\n\nAn airmailed snap on a third down forced Ethan Long to fall on the ball and Arizona State to settle for Zendejas\u2019 36-yard field goal.\n\nThe Sun Devils led 3-0, were out-gained 131-78 and heard a few boos from the home crowd at halftime.\n\n\u201cI get it,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWhen you aren\u2019t playing well, they boo.\u201d\n\nZendejas kicked two more field goals in the third quarter, one after Frank Darby\u2019s 68-yard TD catch was wiped out Aiyuk\u2019s blindside block well away from the ball.\n\nAiyuk next caught a 52-yard pass to the Hornets\u2019 5 and the Sun Devils lost a yard on three successive plays, leading to another Zendejas field goal to open the fourth quarter.\n\nSac State cut the lead to five before Benjamin broke off his long touchdown, giving the Sun Devils the cushion they needed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on some games like that as a player and a coach, on the bad side of it,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe were on the good side of it, we won.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nHolding a Pac-12 team in check on the road should be a huge boost of confidence for Sac State headed into Big Sky play.\n\n\u201cI think what we have seen is that our team is pretty resilient,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf we execute, we have a chance to beat anybody.\u201d\n\nArizona State regressed from its opener and will need to get a lot better with a road game against 19th-ranked Michigan State up next.\n\nTHOMSON\u2019S NIGHT\n\nThomson held his own against the bigger, stronger Sun Devils, throwing for 263 yards and a touchdown on 32-of-50 passing. He also had a few throws he probably would like to have back and his receivers dropped a few balls.\n\n\u201cHe will come back from it and learn from it,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cHe has a lot of ability. It is a big stage and he will play better.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSacramento State opens Big Sky play Sept. 14 against Northern Colorado.\n\nArizona State plays at No. 19 Michigan State on Sept. 14.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Arizona State's Eno Benjamin slipped into an open area across the middle, sprinted past a defender and into the end zone for a long fourth-quarter touchdown.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/sacramento_st_arizona_st_football_21782_c0-159-3795-2371_s1770x1032.jpg?0ec84ac5974ee4b3e87d48e82c1bdf004c060316", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
