In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner.\u201d\n\nDraghi\u2019s comments came as the ECB announced it would step in to support the 19-nation currency bloc by revamping its quantitative easing (QE) programme of bond buying. Starting from November, the central bank will buy \u20ac20bn of bonds a month from commercial banks in an attempt to inject more money into the economy.\n\nThe move restarts a programme paused by the ECB in December after the purchase of \u20ac2.6tn of bonds since first use of QE in 2015.\n\nThe ECB also said it would cut its deposit rate \u2013 the interest paid to commercial banks when they place funds with the central bank \u2013 by 0.1 percentage points to a new all-time low of -0.5%, meaning banks would incur charges on any balances they kept there. Negative interest rates are meant to encourage banks to lend to consumers and businesses, rather than park their money with the ECB.\n\nThe stimulus package comes as the eurozone economy falters alongside a broader global economic slowdown that has been triggered by rising trade protectionism and the US-China trade war.\n\nFactory output has slumped in response to diminishing international trade volumes as Washington and Beijing have imposed punitive tariffs on each other\u2019s goods, while business investment has fallen against the uncertain political backdrop.\n\nEurozone growth fell to 0.2% in the second quarter of 2019, from 0.4% in the first three months of the year, while some economies, including those of Italy and Germany, are flirting with recession.\n\nUnveiling the stimulus package to avert a deeper slowdown, Draghi said: \u201cThe package is quite powerful, both in the short term but also in the long run.\u201d\n\nThe central bank said its QE programme would remain in place for as long as necessary to reinforce its impact.\n\nThe outgoing president of the ECB said he expected interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until inflation accelerated across the eurozone. While the ECB has a target for inflation of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, inflation has remained muted amid weaker economic growth.\n\nSign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nThe ECB\u2019s support for the eurozone economy comes at a tense political moment as Donald Trump attempts to apply pressure on the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as the American economy falters.\n\nIn critical comments less than an hour after the ECB decision, Trump used a tweet to attack the Fed for its lack of action. \u201cEuropean Central Bank, acting quickly, Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points. They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports.... And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!\u201d\n\nTrump has also previously been critical of the ECB for supporting the eurozone economy, arguing that it would be detrimental to US interests.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates in July for the first time in more than a decade, signalling at the time a readiness to provide more support to the US economy if necessary.\n\nThe euro initially fell agains the US dollar after the ECB announcement before rallying by about 0.6% on the American currency to trade at $1.1073.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Mario Draghi says bank will reboot quantitative easing in month Lagarde succeeds him", "authors": ["Richard Partington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a21a238b25c9a52a0e0d581df9916da3bc2d464b/0_276_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8e6a4df58d3b652397a9d3af31e1ca45", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
