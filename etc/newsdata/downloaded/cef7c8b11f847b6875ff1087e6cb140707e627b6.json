The dentist said files on 19 out of the clinic's 22 computers became encrypted.\n\nCBC News has agreed not to identify the dentist to avoid making his clinic a potential target again.\n\nA message left on the infected machines read \"Ryuk,\" identifying the ransomware as the same strain that recently hit three Ontario hospitals and health-care facilities in Alabama and Australia.\n\n\"We were really lucky,\" the Toronto dentist said. \"At least we had a good backup.\"\n\nLast Tuesday, patients started receiving so-called phishing emails \u2014 messages meant to trick users into giving hackers access to the recipient's computer or data.\n\nThis note, which CBC printed out, was left on computers at a Toronto dental clinic recently hit with Ryuk ransomware. (Submitted by clinic)\n\nRansomware typically encrypts files, with attackers demanding a digital currency payment from victims in order to release the data.\n\nRyuk, a form of ransomware first reported in 2018, allows hackers to view a computer's files and gather information for several weeks, unbeknownst to its victims.\n\n'Definite uptick'\n\nThe Toronto dental clinic is just the latest target in a series of ransomware attacks hitting Canadian networks, particularly in the health-care field. A string of the Ontario municipalities \u2014 including Woodstock , Stratford and The Nation \u2014 have previously fallen victim to ransomware.\n\nUntil recently, Canadians seemed \"to have escaped\" a wave of global ransomware attacks, said B.C.-based cybersecurity expert Brett Callow, with the global software firm Emsisoft.\n\n\"Although that seems to have been changing in recent weeks,\" he said. \"There has been a definite uptick.\"\n\nA recent survey of Canadian organizations found the vast majority (88 per cent) experienced a data breach over the last 12 months. The research by the U.S.-based cybersecurity firm Carbon Black also found 82 per cent of Canadian companies surveyed reported an \"increase in overall attack volume.\"\n\nBoth figures represent a slight increase over Carbon Black's previous Canadian threat report, released in March.\n\nRansomware, however, only accounted for 14 per cent of data breaches in the recent survey.\n\nAccording to experts, health-care facilities are increasingly being targeted in ransomware attacks because of the sensitive files they manage. (Shutterstock)\n\n\"The criminal syndicates of the world \u2026 are laser-focused on targeting hospitals and municipalities' emergency management systems,\" because of their importance in critical situations, said Tom Kellerman, Carbon Black's chief cybersecurity officer.\n\n\"[Criminals] recognize that ransomware is far more impactful in these types of organizations due to their mission.\"\n\nThe FBI also issued a warning recently, alerting U.S. organizations to the threat of \"high-impact\" ransomware. The agency said while the incidence of broad ransomware campaigns has declined since 2018, \"losses from ransomware attacks have increased significantly.\"\n\nHacker speaks\n\nThe hacker who targeted the Toronto dental clinic told CBC News he was not involved in the recent cyberattacks on the Ontario hospitals. CBC News briefly exchanged messages with him using the email address provided to the clinic.\n\nThe hacker initially told CBC that the cost to decrypt the dental office's files would be nine bitcoins (nearly $100,000), but later increased the price to 15 bitcoins ($165,000).\n\n\"To confirm our honest intentions,\" he wrote, \"we will unlock two files for free.\"\n\nThe hacker \u2014 whose email address identified him as \"Samuels Marques\" \u2014 declined to say where he was located, or much money he had made from Ryuk attacks.\n\nCybersecurity researchers believe the malicious software was likely developed in Russia.\n\nThe widespread nature of Ryuk attacks may stem from the code's availability on the dark web, a shadowy part of the internet not found on search engines that is difficult for everyday users to access.\n\nThe malware's creators are leasing it online for about $200 US, plus a monthly \"maintenance fee,\" which ensures the code is updated with the latest data to circumvent security technology, said Kellerman\n\nHe said the malware's creators provide it to other hackers so Ryuk can keep gathering information on computer system vulnerabilities, or \"backdoors,\" around the world.\n\n\"They're outsourcing their colonization of infrastructure to other criminals,\" he said.\n\nIt's unclear why Canadian firms are increasingly being targeted, Callow said, but he has a theory.\n\n\"It could simply be that the bad actors are broadening their horizons,\" he said. \"They've had a lot of success in the U.S. and now they're trying their luck in other areas.\"\n\nFree fix?\n\nThe RCMP discourages victims from paying ransom.\n\nIn many cases, organizations with small information technology departments may hire outside firms for help regaining access to files. An online service, likely little-known to Canadians, can also sometimes do the trick for free.\n\nThe No More Ransom Project \u2014 an initiative involving the European Union's law enforcement agency, Europol \u2014 offers tools on its website to unlock files encrypted with malware. The service is available to users around the world, including in Canada.\n\nNew Zealand-based Emsisoft acts as a project partner, lending decryption tools to the initiative.\n\nEuropol's European Cybercrime Centre is one of the partners involved in the No More Ransom Project. (Ilvy Njiokiktjien/EPA)\n\nCallow said Emsisoft is mainly an anti-virus company, but it provides ransomware-fighting tools as a \"public service.\"\n\nHe stresses though that Ryuk often causes damage to files it encrypts, making them irrecoverable. \"So data loss is very common in these cases, even if the ransom is paid.\"\n\nBut for \"the three to five per cent [of cases] in which we can help,\" Callow said, \"our services are provided at no cost whatsoever.\"\n\nThe Toronto dentist said his clinic didn't pay to regain its files, and despite the messages exchanged with CBC News, no specific amount was demanded. But he said if the price were right, he wouldn't hesitate to pay.\n\n\"If someone said to me, 'Pay $20,000 and you get your files back,' I'd give them the money,\" he said. \"Because I need my files.\"\n\nThe clinic is now taking steps, such as reinforcing firewalls and issuing new computer usage guidelines for staff, he said.\n\nHis message for others? Ransomware is a \"real issue \u2026 and it's bound to get worse.\"", "description": "A Toronto dental clinic has become one of the latest targets\u00a0in a series of ransomware attacks hitting Canadian networks, particularly in the health-care field.
