Instead of accepting that offer, Iranian leaders indicated this week a desire to start development of advanced centrifuges in violation of the deal.\n\nWhile France has expressed dismay at this decision, Trump has indicated a willingness to talk to Iran \u2014 although he said lifting sanctions is off the table \u2014 raising the eyebrows of who saw the new \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d approach as a rebuke of the Obama era\u2019s conciliatory stance toward the Middle Eastern nation.\n\nSeparately, the United States refused to ease its economic sanctions on Iran; imposed fresh ones designed to choke off the smuggling of Iranian oil; and rebuffed, but did not rule out, the French plan to give Tehran a $15 billion credit line. The moves suggested that Iran, the United States and the major European powers may be leaving the door open for diplomacy to try resolve a dispute over Iran's nuclear program, even as they largely stuck to entrenched positions.\n\nThose who saw Trump\u2019s move to disengage from the Iran nuclear deal as a rebuke of Obama\u2019s questionable foreign policy legacy \u2014 and Obama had overtly linked his legacy to the 2015 deal \u2014 are being told by some media outlets that they should rethink that notion.\n\nIn July, Politico reported Trump\u2019s willingness to engage with Iran on a newer, better deal looked a lot like the tactic the Obama administration used in striking the deal originally.\n\nTrump has repeatedly urged Iran to engage in negotiations with him, while saying that Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions are his chief concern \u2014 \u201cA lot of progress has been made. And they'd like to talk,\u201d Trump asserted Tuesday at the White House. His aides and allies, meanwhile, have recently suggested that Iran and other countries should follow the guidelines of a deal they themselves have shunned as worthless. At times, analysts and former officials say, it sounds like Trump wants to strike a deal that essentially mirrors the agreement that his White House predecessor inked \u2014 even if he\u2019d never be willing to admit it. Iranian officials seem willing to egg him on, saying they\u2019ll talk so long as Trump lifts the sanctions he\u2019s imposed on them and returns to the 2015 Iran deal. And as European ministers warn that the existing deal is nearly extinct, Trump may feel like he is backed into a corner and running out of options.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) told The Hudson Institute of his concern that \u201cdeep state\u201d, legacy Obama-era employees still working at the Departments of Defense and State may be trying to convince Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to keep portions of the original deal in place by allowing for oil waivers that give Iranians the ability to sell millions of barrels of oil a day.\n\nThe senator said that Trump is surrounded by the deep state. \u201cTheir overarching objective is to prevent this administration from dismantling the Iran deal completely, because they believe one of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates is going to win. We\u2019ve all seen the debate stages Tweedledum and Tweedle-dumber, and every one of them would eagerly reinstate the Iran deal. \u201cIf you look at the debates,\u201d he continued, \u201cvery little of what they\u2019ve talked about is foreign policy [but] it has been almost universally, anti-Israel and weakening our military.\u201d He called Trump to \u201cfinish the job\u201d and end the waivers, so \u201cthere will be no deal to reinstate.\n\nWhichever the direction the Trump administration chooses to go, it\u2019s clear that most Democratic candidates for president would prefer to stay in the original deal. While that\u2019s probably not a good enough reason to immediately change course and shut down the possibility of further negotiations, the Trump administration may not need to do much of anything: the bad behavior of the Iranian regime seems to be doing the work of turning away nations like France who had an interest in retaining the original agreement.\n\nIn short, Iran may not need anyone\u2019s help to further isolate themselves. They could end up without any deal based on their behavior alone.\n\nSarah Lee is a freelance writer and policy wonk living and working in Washington, DC.", "description": ".09/06/2019 22:13:29PM EST.", "authors": ["Sarah", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/308/ad57e3c0-481c-4cfd-88f0-ddc5b8ee7829.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
