Together, this cluster of duties constrains the president with something similar to fiduciary duties.\n\nThe \u201cfaithful execution\u201d clause thus indicates that the president is already bound to remove someone only for good-faith reasons, in the public interest. So it must be constitutional for Congress to say out loud in a statute what is already commanded by the Constitution: Removal authority must be constrained because a president is never allowed to fire officers in bad faith.\n\nThe argument for unconstrained removal authority also relies on a series of arguments James Madison made not in the Constitutional Convention or in the Federalist Papers but in 1789, after the adoption of the Constitution, in the House of Representatives. Madison was most focused on showing that removal had to inhere in the executive rather than being subject to Senate consent or the impeachment process. A modest constraint on removal that is already required by the faithful execution clauses still can vindicate Madison\u2019s preference to give the president the right to be the one to fire agency heads.\n\nOne might argue that \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\u201d arguably goes beyond a constitutional good-faith requirement. A policy disagreement might be the basis of good-faith removal, but is it sufficient to meet the statutory terms of \u201cinefficiency\u201d or \u201cneglect\u201d?\n\nCongress sometimes is permitted to draw the bounds of \u201cfaithfulness\u201d more specifically. First, the history of \u201cfaithful execution\u201d and other parts of Article II indicate general deference to Congress\u2019s law-giving authority and judgment. Within reasonable limits, Congress can animate the concept of \u201cfaithful execution\u201d as a limit on a president\u2019s removal discretion. Second, everyone knows \u201cgood faith\u201d is vague; allowing Congress room to be more specific or to tailor protections for particular offices is not a remarkable exception. Congress should have latitude to specify that \u201cfaithful execution\u201d in some agencies dealing with especially sensitive matters or special expertise may require extra insulation, even from removal for policy disagreements, to guard against self-interested presidential pressure and manipulation. Third, the limits Congress creates for independent agencies still leaves the president with broad discretion to remove officials, retaining the Constitution\u2019s basic unitary structure.\n\nSome self-professed textualists and originalists suggest that the Constitution requires a president to have unlimited discretion over removal. But the text on which they rely shows the opposite: The Constitution\u2019s \u201cfaithful execution\u201d clauses impose a duty of good faith. For generations, Congress has simply articulated a version of how that duty constrains the president\u2019s power to fire a special set of agency heads.\n\nThe political and practical stakes are enormous not just for the Trump era, but for whether presidential power can be exercised only in good faith. That bedrock principle of good faith \u2014 which was true at the founding and binds the president in all of his actions \u2014 remains essential to good government and to an independent and professional administrative state.", "description": "The justices could take up a case on whether the president can fire the heads of independent agencies like the Fed.", "authors": ["Jed Handelsman Shugerman", "Ethan J.
