The campaign says it was prepared to sue, and Trump himself accused Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Trump critic, of trying to sabotage the event.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign said in a statement Tuesday that Target Center operators backed off cancelling the contract, and the Trump campaign is not paying any additional money.\n\nFrey earlier defended the security cost estimate, saying it was reasonable and that he had a duty to taxpayers to ensure safety.\n\n___\n\n1:17 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is threatening to sue Minneapolis for trying to force it to pay $530,000 in security costs for this week\u2019s rally in the city.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign accused Mayor Jacob Frey, who has been critical of the president, of \u201cconjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security\u201d at Thursday\u2019s rally at Target Center.\n\nThe campaign said arena management attempted to pass the costs to the campaign under threat of withholding use of the arena.
