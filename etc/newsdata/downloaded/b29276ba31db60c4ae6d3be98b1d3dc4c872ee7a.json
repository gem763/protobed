JoEllen Browning, 65, died in April of multiple stab wounds.\n\nBrowning had been the director of operating budgets and an employee at University of Iowa Health Care since 1977.\n\nOn the morning of April 5, Iowa City police officers were dispatched to Browning's home for a reported \"unresponsive female.\"\n\nAutopsy results from the Johnson County Medical Examiner found Browning's death was a homicide and that she died of stab wounds. Located on the east side of town, the home is co-owned by JoEllen Browning and Roy Browning.\n\nAuthorities told the Iowa City Press-Citizen that they conducted 100 interviews during the investigation. Roy Browning's charges were filed Monday afternoon, court records show.\n\nWhat happened April 5\n\nRoy Browning Jr. called Iowa City police at about 7 a.m. that day, reporting that JoEllen was unresponsive in her bedroom, according to a criminal complaint filed in Johnson County. She had been stabbed in the front and back of her torso and on her left hand; her death was ruled a homicide.\n\nInvestigators found no evidence of forced entry into the home, but saw blood in the master bedroom and shower, court records show. A sample taken from JoEllen Browning's fingernail showed DNA from Roy Browning Jr. on her finger.\n\nAuthorities also say financial records show that Roy Browning had taken money from a joint bank account and placed it into a personal account for himself. JoEllen Browning on April 1 texted her husband, asking him about account discrepancies and told him that she wanted to talk with their financial institution, officials learned after reviewing cellphone and email records.\n\nShe set up a meeting and informed her husband via text April 4 that the couple were to see a banker the following day. Roy Browning Jr. acknowledged the meeting, but that same day purchased gloves and towels from a nearby paint supply store, the complaint states. An employee told investigators that he gave Browning Jr. additional gloves that day. Video surveillance put him at the store less than an hour after being informed of the visit with the financial institution.\n\nInvestigators found out that Roy Browning Jr. had taken out at least four different loans of $4,000 with an interest rate of more than 300% in Illinois. He told the company not to contact his wife about the checks, court records show.\n\nOfficials also spoke with the banker who was planning to meet with the Brownings on April 5, the day JoEllen Browning's body was discovered.\n\n\"JoEllen was preparing for tax season and had found some problems with Roy and JoEllen's accounts...\" the complaint states. \"The representative was prepared to tell JoEllen at this meeting that one of their savings accounts was depleted and Roy had taken out out loans of which JoEllen was not aware.\n\n\"The representative was prepared to tell JoEllen that an account JoEllen thought was active never actually existed.\"\n\nRecords showed that Browning used his personal checking account to pay more than $17,600 toward the balance on a credit card under JoEllen's name shortly after his wife died. The credit card was still being used after her funeral April 12, officials found.\n\n\"JoEllen Browning had a retirement and life insurance policy worth in excess of $2 million,\" investigators wrote in their complaint. \"In reviewing finances, records show that JoEllen Browning was financially stable and Roy Browning did not have a revenue source.\"\n\nInvestigators never found the items Roy bought at the paint supply store. Roy Browning appears to be hiring his own attorney, court records show, and is next due in court at 2 p.m. Nov. 8.\n\nFollow Tyler Davis on Twitter: @TDavisDMR", "description": "Roy  Browning Jr. is charged with murder in relation to the death of JoEllen Browning, who worked for the university for more than four decades.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/29/PDEM/946f924a-078c-41b2-a938-38bed01561af-RoyBrowning.jpg?crop=450,600,x15,y0&width=450&height=562&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
