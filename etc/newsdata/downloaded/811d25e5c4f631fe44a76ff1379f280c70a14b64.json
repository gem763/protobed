In addition, the big screens at Tottenham Stadium initially showed that VAR had overturned the goal, before the referee pointed to the spot and allowed it to stand.\n\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche was also left fuming after VAR overturned a late equalizer for his team against Leicester, which came from behind to win 2-1 on the day the club marked the one-year anniversary of chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha\u2019s death.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers, meanwhile, had two goals disallowed by VAR in the first half as it was held to a 1-1 draw by Southampton at home - although both those decisions appeared correct.\n\nAlso Saturday, Chelsea joined Leicester in moving into the top four by beating Newcastle 1-0 at home for its fifth straight win in all competitions, Everton beat West Ham 2-0, Aston Villa rallied to defeat 10-man Brighton 2-1, and Bournemouth drew 0-0 at home against Norwich.\n\nManchester City was playing at Crystal Palace in the late game.\n\nVAR CONFUSION\n\nThe message on the big screens at Tottenham Stadium said: No Goal. That wasn\u2019t the message referee Chris Kavanagh received in his ear from the video replay booth, though. So Kavanagh allowed Alli\u2019s 86th-minute equalizer to stand, meaning the home crowd went from celebrating to groaning to once again cheering in a confusing couple of minutes that will only fuel the debate about the use of VAR in the Premier League.\n\nThe goal will do little to quell talk about a crisis brewing at Spurs, either.\n\nWatford looked headed for its first league win of the season after Abdoulaye Doucoure put the visitors ahead in the sixth minute and Tottenham once again looked short of inspiration as it struggled to find a response.\n\nBut Alli scored his first goal for Spurs since January, capitalizing on a goalkeeping mistake by Ben Foster.\n\nIt saved Spurs from a third straight loss in all competitions, following the embarrassing 7-2 rout by Bayern Munich in the Champions League and a 3-0 defeat to Brighton before the international break.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s a relief,\u201d Alli said about the VAR decision. \u201cI was sure it didn\u2019t hit my hand but then you start thinking did it? I tried to make sure it didn\u2019t touch it so I could get the strike away. . We know we have a world-class team so it\u2019s about showing what we can do when things don\u2019t go our way. It\u2019s important we turn it around. We know how good we are, we just have to start showing it on the pitch.\u201d\n\nCHELSEA ROLLING\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea is starting to look like a genuine top-four contender.\n\nMarcos Alonso scored his first goal of the season to break the deadlock against Newcastle in the 73rd minute at Stamford Bridge.\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi was impressive again for Chelsea and helped set up the goal, having previously created good scoring chances for Willian and Mason Mount.\n\nThe win moved Chelsea into the top four for the first time this season, although it could be overtaken by Arsenal on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe know we want to be challenging in the top four and from a slightly difficult start it\u2019s a good sign that we are moving in the right direction,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cBut our arrival in the top four must give us the hunger to stay there.\u201d\n\nLEICESTER MOURNS\n\nIt was an emotional afternoon at the King Power Stadium as Leicester used the Burnley game to honor Vichai, the Thai billionaire who died in a helicopter crash just outside the venue on Oct. 27 last year.\n\nAround 5,000 supporters took part in a walk through the city to the stadium before the match, while a minute\u2019s silence was held before kick off.\n\nYouri Tielemans scored the winner in the 74th minute to complete a comeback, after Jamie Vardy had canceled out an opening goal for the visitors by former Leicester player Chris Wood.\n\nWood later thought he had equalized but his goal was ruled out by VAR for a trip on Jonny Evans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed. I\u2019m a big fan of VAR but it has to be used more wisely than that,\u201d Dyche said. \u201cThere is contact but we\u2019re talking about people who have been around the game long enough to know what body language means. . The key moment has gone against us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tottenham's struggles in the Premier League showed no signs of ending as Spurs needed a late equalizer just to earn a 1-1 home draw against last-place Watford on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mattias Karen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/britain_soccer_premier_league_84441_c185-0-3315-1826_s1200x700.jpg?35052b6098dbb13712b5351f10c557ba4eeb4d2f", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
