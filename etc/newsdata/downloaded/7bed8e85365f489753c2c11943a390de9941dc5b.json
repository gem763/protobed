Looking forward to getting further answers as we search for #JusticeforHarry. @Justice4Harry \u2014 Radd Seiger (@RaddSeiger) October 15, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe family, who met Foreign Secretary Dominic Rabb in the UK last week, have also demanded an investigation over the Foreign Office\u2019s (FCO) advice to Northamptonshire Police that Ms Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity.\n\nThey are demanding to see all emails, messages and notes sent in relation to her immunity status.\n\nSpeaking in New York, family spokesman Radd Seiger said: \u2018We want to conduct an investigation into the FCO\u2019s decision to advise Northamptonshire Police that this lady had the benefit of diplomatic immunity.\n\n\u2018What we don\u2019t know is whether somebody cocked up or whether they were put under pressure by the Americans to concede.\u2019\n\nIf they are not happy with the documents, the family say they will then ask for a judge\u2019s opinion on the lawfulness of the FCO\u2019s decision.\n\nMr Seiger added: \u2018If we\u2019re not satisfied, then we\u2019ll go to a judicial review and ask a High Court judge to review it all.\u2019\n\nAnne Sacoolas, 42, claimed diplomatic immunity over the death of motorcyclist Harry Dunn (Picture: Enterprise News and Pictures)\n\nOn Saturday, before the family left for the US, they received a letter from Mr Raab, saying that Mrs Sacoolas, 42, no longer had immunity.\n\n\u2018The letter is worded very carefully, they\u2019re not saying it\u2019s just a change of heart \u2013 they are saying that it\u2019s an evolution,\u2019 said Mr Seiger.\n\nHe also said that the family\u2019s lawyers, Mark Stephens and Geoffrey Robertson QC, believe \u2018they\u2019ve (the FCO) been lying to you\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Charles and Mr Dunn said: \u2018We were astonished last Saturday to receive the hand-delivered letter from the FCO indicating that Mrs Sacoolas did not in fact have diplomatic immunity.\n\n\u2018We were still reeling from our terrible meeting with Dominic Raab, Foreign Secretary, last Wednesday, just three days earlier, where he was adamant that Mrs Sacoolas did have immunity.\n\n\u2018Something is not right. We will not rest until we get the truth. We will not let Harry passing be in vain.\u2019\n\nMrs Sacoolas has said she is \u2018terribly sorry\u2019 about the incident and that she had \u2018no time to react\u2019 when she saw Mr Dunn\u2019s motorbike.\n\nHer lawyer, Amy Jeffress, told the Mirror: \u2018Anne was driving on the wrong side of the road and is terribly, terribly sorry for that tragic mistake.\n\n\u2018She wants to meet the family and apologise and take responsibility. Anne had no time to react when she saw the motorbike.\u2019\n\nMs Jeffress, from US firm Arnold & Porter, said the diplomat\u2019s wife also stayed at the scene and flagged down other people to help the teenager.\n\nMs Jeffress added: \u2018She spoke to Harry to tell him that she would call for help.\n\n\u2018She waved down another car. That driver offered to assist Harry so that Anne could comfort her young children in her car.\u2019\n\nThe FCO has been contacted for comment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
