They have a fixed interest rate of 4.45 per cent and are due for repayment in December 2022.\n\nInvestors can buy and sell such bonds in the secondary market, and the market price reflects a range of things, but mostly investor sentiment towards the likelihood of the debt being repaid.\n\nMacro trends\n\nIn February, the AAPT bond was changing hands at 87.8 per cent of its face value, but its market price rose sharply during April, May and June, and it traded above 100 per cent of its face value last week.\n\nAn institutional investor in the Australian credit market, who declined to be named because of the controversy attached to Adani, said macro trends in bonds might explain part of the rally in the AAPT bonds.\n\nBond markets witnessed one of their biggest ever rallies in August and September, as rising concerns about the health of the global economy and a trade war between the US and China pushed down yields on the Australian government's 10-year bond to a record low.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the institutional investor pointed to credit spreads as proof that AAPT bonds had outperformed benchmark bonds \u2013 such as the US Treasury due for maturity in November 2022 \u2013 by about 260 basis points this year.\n\nHe said the majority of the rally in AAPT bonds was, therefore, owing to improved sentiment towards Adani.\n\n''The price is telling you the market is more confident about getting back the full value of the bond in December 2022,'' he said.\n\nPalaszczuk's 'wake-up call'\n\nPerhaps the biggest factor in improving sentiment towards the AAPT bonds was the re-election of Scott Morrison's Coalition government in May following strong voter support in regional Queensland and other electorates with links to coal mining.\n\nThe federal election result on May 18 prompted Queensland's Labor premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to declare she had also heard a ''wake up call'' regarding the Carmichael project, and her government has since been far more supportive of the mine.\n\nBy June, Ms Palaszczuk had granted final environmental approvals for the Carmichael project's use of groundwater, ending almost a decade of efforts by Adani to secure the green light for the mine.\n\nConstruction of the Carmichael project has now been under way for almost four months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AAPT bonds were issued by the Bank of New York Mellon in December 2017.\n\nBloomberg data suggests the biggest holders of the AAPT bonds include Atlanta-based asset manager Invesco and Wisconsin-based Thompson Investment Management.\n\nThe latter has been among the most aggressive buyers of the bonds in 2019, and the Bloomberg data suggests Macquarie has been among the biggest sellers this year.\n\nAsked what had attracted his firm to Adani's bonds, Thompson Investment Management chief investment officer James Evans would only say: ''I appreciate your interest in our firm. However, our policy is to not comment publicly on investments within the Fund.''\n\nA second AAPT bond due to mature in May 2020 was also trading above 100 per cent of its face value on Friday.\n\nThe rush for Adani's debt comes despite prices for thermal coal sliding over the past year.\n\nPrices for top quality thermal coal from New South Wales' Hunter Valley have fallen from $US118 per tonne to $US68 per tonne over the past year, according to figures published by Whitehaven Coal last week.\n\nCarmichael is expected to sell a type of coal that fetches lower prices than the top quality Hunter Valley coal, suggesting it would be receiving closer to $US50 per tonne for its product if it were being exported today.\n\nCoking coal prices have also slumped of late. Top quality coking coal from Queensland was fetching $US152 per tonne on October 21, down from $US210 per tonne in May.", "description": "In February, the AAPT bond was changing hands at 87.8 per cent of its face value.
