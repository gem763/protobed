I have always challenged schools to use taxpayers' money as effectively as possible.'\n\nHe warned he would 'bear down on unjustified pay'.\n\nLast year 66 heads earned more than the Prime Minister's \u00a3150,000 salary, with one paid \u00a3260,000.\n\nHigh earners include Colin Hall, head of Holland Park School in west London \u2013 once dubbed 'the socialist Eton' \u2013 who earned \u00a3260,000 last year, and Dayo Olukoshi, executive head of Brampton Manor Academy in east London, who took home \u00a3220,000.\n\nExecutives have continued to rake in high salaries despite an attempted crackdown from the Department for Education.\n\nAs education secretary, Michael Gove pledged in 2010 that no headteacher would earn more than the prime minister.\n\nAnd last year ministers wrote to trusts that were paying at least one member of staff a salary of more than \u00a3150,000.\n\nIt demanded information about the 'process' and 'rationale' for setting salaries at this level, requesting information about the responsibilities staff have.\n\nAny academies ignoring the request face being penalised in a 'financial capability assessment' due to be launched next year.", "description": "The new funding, which was announced last night by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, can be used to expand classrooms and upgrade facilities such as sports halls.", "authors": ["Eleanor Hayward For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/00/20261318-0-image-a-26_1572223446465.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
