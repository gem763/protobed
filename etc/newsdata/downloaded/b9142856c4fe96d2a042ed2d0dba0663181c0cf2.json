Hundreds of U.S. companies have sold out to China\u2019s regime.", "language": "en", "text": "Or KFC. Or how about Walmart?\n\nIt\u2019s more than a little ludicrous for everyone from Ted Cruz to Beto O\u2019Rourke to suddenly hand the NBA and the Rockets the tab for American toadying to authoritarians in Beijing. If they want to draw that line in the sand, they can draw it with any of their favorite dozen American corporations \u2014 only that wouldn\u2019t be so politically convenient, would it?\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s easier to hurl righteous outrage and umbrage at a large target such as Rockets star James Harden, who on Monday apologized to China for hurt feelings at the behest of his bosses. \u201cWe love China,\u201d he said. It\u2019s far more pat and satisfying to go all-in at Rockets management for making General Manager Daryl Morey apologize for his tweet over the weekend in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nAnd, boy, isn\u2019t it an easy viral sound clip to accuse the entire NBA of \u201cblatant prioritization of profits over human rights,\u201d as O\u2019Rourke did, and call it an embarrassment, simply because the league called the incident \u201cregrettable\u201d and tried to patch things up with its Chinese counterparts?\n\nYou want to be angry at the NBA for cowering in the face of China\u2019s authoritarian regime? You want to accuse NBA Commissioner Adam Silver of supporting a murderous dictatorship simply to further business interests in China? Fine. Good for you.\n\nAD\n\nBut understand the NBA is only imitating that smooth move patented by dozens of other fine, flag-waving American corporations in their dealings with China. A half-dozen American corporate sponsors set the template a decade ago at the Beijing Olympics, when they colluded in the silencing of U.S. athletes and were far more directly complicit in a host of human rights violations.\n\nAD\n\nRemember what champs Visa and General Electric were when the Chinese refused to grant entry to American athlete Joey Cheek because he had been too audible of an activist against abuses in Darfur? And how about the courageous support Coca-Cola gave to Chinese dissidents when Beijing authorities cracked down on them in advance of those Games?\n\nNever forget the standup position Johnson & Johnson took when Steven Spielberg quit as artistic director of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies because Beijing not only failed to honor a single one of the reform promises it had made in procuring the right to host the Games but actually went on a terroristic bender against its own citizens, destroying whole neighborhoods, enlisting slave labor and throwing anyone who didn\u2019t like it into a camp.\n\nAD\n\nFord. GM. Starbucks. Papa John\u2019s. All of them do massive business with China. Abercrombie & Fitch. Boeing. Procter & Gamble. Start with them. All of them have long known what the conditions and equations are for doing business in the China market.\n\nAD\n\nAustralian journalist Geremie Barm\u00e9, who has covered China for many years, sums it up in a phrase: \u201ccontentious friendship.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be a friend of China, the foreigner is often expected to stomach unpalatable situations, and keep silent in the face of egregious behavior,\u201d he has written. \u201cA friend of China might enjoy the privilege of offering the occasional word of caution in private; in the public arena he or she is expected to have the good sense and courtesy to be \u2018objective.\u2019 That is to toe the line, whatever that happens to be. The concept of \u2018friendship\u2019 thus degenerates into little more than an effective tool for emotional blackmail and enforced complicity.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThroughout the Beijing Olympics, American companies remained silent. So did IOC President Jacques Rogge. When Rogge finally did open his mouth to protest someone\u2019s conduct, it wasn\u2019t anyone in China\u2019s leaderships. The man he decided to pick was Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, for his bad manners in celebrating too boldly. The outrage at the NBA is more than a little remindful of that.\n\nAD\n\nYes, the NBA has made a mutually beneficial commercial accommodation with China. There are 800 million Chinese viewers of the league, according to Time, and there is a 30-year media partnership. You have a problem with that or consider it gutless? Then you have a problem with literally hundreds of American companies.\n\nRead more NBA coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Attacking the league for distancing itself from criticism of Beijing\u2019s crackdown against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong is politically convenient", "authors": ["Sally Jenkins", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ORvrn7XZi7KuENhmkntYlB_bP7k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EURVSNFST4I6BMUO3UDE6BLU3M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
