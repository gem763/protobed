And the ideal way to explore everywhere from the western shores of Portugal to the wintry borders of Russia? Rail.\n\nPerhaps you secretly dream of impulsively stepping aboard an exotic European express, then speeding across a mosaic of miracles in the company of random and intriguing companions. It certainly beats the average commute.\n\nYet rail wanderers know that it is never quite that easy. These days, many of Europe\u2019s fastest trains are run by self-contained companies rather than as integral elements of national and international networks.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTravellers simply don\u2019t turn up at London St Pancras and decide, on a whim, to board a train to Amsterdam, Brussels or Paris. The Eurostar network, with special security rules through the Channel Tunnel, is particularly anti-impulsive.\n\nOnce you reach the continent, though, you might imagine that spontaneity is easily achieved with the help of that marvellous invention, the Interrail pass. Since 1972, the unlimited-travel ticket has been powering spur-of-the-moment journeys.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Not according to Nicky Gardner and Susanne Kries, editors of Europe by Rail (new 16th edition, \u00a316.99). Distant memories of journeys past become rose-tinted, they say.\n\n\u201cThere was never a time, not even back in the early days of Interrail, when travellers with a pass could just hop on any train without having to bother with reservations and supplements.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s an extensive international express network was embroidered across the continent. But, they note: \u201cThe entire Trans-Europe Express network was simply out-of-bounds to pass holders.\u201c\n\nCelebrate the present, they urge. Slow, no-supplement trains have accelerated. For example, the \u201cclassic\u201d service from Barcelona via Zaragoza to Madrid takes nine hours, compared with 13 hours when Interrail began in 1972.\n\nThe fastest trains from Paris to Zurich and Munich to Milan were off-limits. French Railways was suspicious of the Interrail concept and applied its own restrictions designed to insulate normal fare-paying passengers from pass-holders. Interrail wasn\u2019t valid on the only daily train between Bordeaux and Grenoble, for example.\n\nToday, say Nicky and Susanne, Interrail remains \u201ca potent force for fostering mutual understanding between Europeans\u201d. But they caution against excessive use of the unlimited travel ticket. In their ideal prescription for the traditional one-month pass, they recommend no more than seven hours\u2019 travel a day, and a full 14 no-train days.\n\nThey tell the story of a young Irish traveller who had never ventured beyond the republic until he bought an Interrail pass and boarded a ferry to France.\n\nA month later he was back, having visited 31 countries at a rate of one per day. But rather than being hooked on the romance of rail, he said it was the worst month of his entire life.\n\n\u201cHe has not once set foot on a train since.\u201d", "description": "Europe, however you may feel about it right now, remains a continent of wonders.
