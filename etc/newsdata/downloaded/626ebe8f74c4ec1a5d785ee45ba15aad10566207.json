But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney denied that the aid was also contingent on a Ukrainian investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, or Biden\u2019s son Hunter, another potential quid pro quo that congressional Democrats are looking into as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nMulvaney defended the president\u2019s actions as commonplace and appropriate. \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nLater, after Trump\u2019s lawyer and other Republicans distanced themselves from Mulvaney, the White House scrambled to walk back his comments, issuing an official statement blaming the media for misconstruing his words \u201cto advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Mulvaney\u2019s written statement said, \u201cthere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election. There was never any connection between the funds and the Ukrainians doing anything with the server . . . there was never any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney\u2019s comments at the news conference \u2014 and his attempt to back out of them \u2014 added to a growing swirl of crisis around Trump, brought on not only by the specter of impeachment but also his erratic decision-making regarding the country\u2019s military presence in Syria and the announcement Thursday, also by Mulvaney, that next year\u2019s G-7 summit of world leaders will be held at Trump\u2019s Miami resort. That decision, which could enrich the president while raising the profile of one of his struggling properties, has been widely criticized as an unprecedented conflict of interest.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, where Democrats are building their case against the president, impeachment investigators spent nine hours Thursday deposing U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, the latest in a succession of officials to appear for closed-door testimony about the administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nSondland told them that the president had outsourced U.S. policy on Ukraine to Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 a decision he said he disagreed with but carried out nonetheless. Giuliani had been pushing the Ukrainians to investigate interference in the 2016 election.\n\nAD\n\nIn a sign of how potentially damaging Mulvaney\u2019s remarks were, Jay Sekulow, another of Trump\u2019s personal attorneys, released a statement that said: \u201cThe President\u2019s legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing.\u201d Within the hour, Mulvaney issued his statement attempting to walk back what he\u2019d said earlier.\n\nEven before Sekulow issued his statement, a Justice Department official took issue with Mulvaney\u2019s original remarks: \u201cIf the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney\u2019s comments alarmed and incensed some Republicans, who have supported Trump but were unaware whether the White House was intentionally shifting its defense strategy.\n\n\u201cTotally inexplicable,\u201d said one GOP lawmaker, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid. \u201cHe literally said the thing the president and everyone else said did not happen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTo the Democrats on the three panels conducting the impeachment probe, Mulvaney\u2019s words marked a significant turning point.\n\n\u201cWe have a confession from the president,\u201d said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, referring to Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump pressured his counterpart to open investigations into the 2016 election and the Bidens.\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney, Swalwell said, \u201cco-signed the president\u2019s confession,\u201d adding that the administration was still engaging in \u201can ongoing coverup.\u201d\n\nDuring his news conference, Mulvaney denied such assertions, saying the administration had not attempted to hide anything by moving a transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky to a more secure server at the White House.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet me ask you this: If we wanted to cover this up, would we have called the Department of Justice almost immediately and have them look at the transcript of the tape, which we did, by the way?\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cIf we wanted to cover this up, would we have released it to the public?\u201d\n\nAs Mulvaney jousted with reporters at the White House, members of the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees \u2014 which are conducting the impeachment probe \u2014 questioned Sondland, who said he was uncomfortable with the decision to cede responsibility for Ukraine policy to Giuliani. \u201cI would not have recommended that Mr. Giuliani or any private citizen be involved in these foreign policy matters,\u201d Sondland said, according to his prepared remarks.\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney dismissed those concerns, defending the president\u2019s right to put foreign policy in the hands of his personal lawyer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou may not like the fact that Giuliani was involved. That\u2019s great; that\u2019s fine,\u201d Mulvaney said, referencing Sondland\u2019s remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s not illegal. It\u2019s not impeachable . . . The president gets to set foreign policy, and he gets to choose who to do so, as long as it doesn\u2019t violate any law.\u201d\n\nSondland, a major Trump donor who has became a focus of the impeachment inquiry because of his outsized role in U.S.-Ukraine policy, criticized the president\u2019s temporary hold on aid and the recall of the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Sondland called her an \u201cexcellent diplomat\u201d and said he \u201cregretted\u201d her departure, which followed a campaign by Giuliani to paint her as disloyal to the president.\n\nAD\n\nDemocratic lawmakers emerging from Sondland\u2019s deposition said that although they found him to be generally credible and were glad that he chose to testify despite White House pressure not to, they thought Sondland was being selective and cagey with details.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s clearly trying to defend his reputation and his own behavior,\u201d said Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He also criticized some of Sondland\u2019s testimony as \u201cnot credible to me, with respect to his sort of not understanding all the things that were happening around him, and in full view of the American people.\u201d\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Sondland, a hotel magnate who came to the job with no diplomatic experience, depicts himself as a well-meaning but in some cases out-of-the-loop emissary for the president who tried to do what he could to prop up the government of Ukraine as it fends off Russian-backed separatists.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign,\u201d he said, explaining that he understood that Burisma, the Ukrainian energy firm that employed Hunter Biden, was \u201cone of many examples of Ukrainian companies run by oligarchs and lacking the type of corporate governance structures found in Western companies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSondland\u2019s apparent failure to connect the dots between Burisma and the Bidens occurred as Giuliani made several televised appearances over the spring and summer criticizing Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement on the board, and numerous newspaper and magazine articles questioned whether his role at Burisma could prove to be a drag on his father\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cWithholding foreign aid to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong,\u201d he stated in his prepared testimony. \u201cI did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings.\u201d\n\nBut that testimony appears to conflict with what other current and former Trump administration officials told House investigators over the past two weeks.\n\nFiona Hill, the National Security Council\u2019s former senior director for Russia and Europe, told House investigators that she was concerned by Sondland\u2019s talk of investigations in a July meeting, which she eventually relayed to a lawyer for the National Security Council.\n\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia George Kent testified that Sondland was deputized, along with former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, to be one of \u201cthree amigos\u201d running Ukraine policy. The move came during a May meeting that Mulvaney organized following Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster.\n\nLast week, Volker provided impeachment investigators with text messages showing that Sondland had said Trump, before agreeing to meet in person with his Ukrainian counterpart, wanted the \u201cdeliverable\u201d of a promise from Zelensky to investigate Burisma and the 2016 election.\n\nSondland claimed that his pursuit of investigations in Ukraine were always in line with long-standing U.S. policy to push for transparency and anti-corruption efforts in the country. He added that he was never aware of objections to the plans for Ukraine policy from Hill or her boss, then-national security adviser John Bolton. Hill testified Monday that Bolton was livid that Giuliani was directing a shadow Ukraine policy.\n\n\u201cI have to view her testimony \u2014 if the media reports are accurate \u2014 as the product of hindsight and in the context of the widely known tensions between the NSC, on the one hand, and the State Department, on the other hand,\u201d Sondland said.", "description": "Mulvaney defended the president\u2019s actions as commonplace and appropriate. \u201cI have news for everybody: get over it.
