Kavanaugh is the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, while 14% of respondents selected Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016. Fewer than half correctly identified John G. Roberts Jr. as chief justice.\n\nMeanwhile, 18% of the respondents incorrectly agreed that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the author of the New Deal, a suite of public programs enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Depression-era. In addition, two-thirds do not know how long U.S. lawmakers actually serve in office.\n\nThe organization blames such misinformation on the \u201csteady deterioration\u201d of the curriculum.\n\n\u201cWhen American history and government courses are removed, you begin to see disheartening survey responses like these, and America\u2019s experiment in self-government begins to slip from our grasp,\u201d said Michael Poliakoff, president of the nonprofit group \u2014 who adds that just 18% of colleges now require students to take courses in the U.S. government or American history.\n\nThe organization based that percentage after analyzing the content of 1,123 college curriculums around the country.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
