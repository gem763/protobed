After a brief struggle the protestor was dragged to the platform, where he was swallowed by a crowd of people shoving and shouting before a woman and a member of the Tube staff intervened to restore order.\n\n\u201cThe crowd became hostile very quickly due to wanting to go to work. I sympathize with the aims of Extinction Rebellion but this was an own goal,\u201d said Turan Basri, 57, an environmental health manager, who witnessed the incident.\n\n\u201cCanning Town is a very working class area. Seeing what they perceived to be middle-class protesters preventing working class people from earning a living didn\u2019t go down well,\u201d Basri said.\n\nBritish Transport Police said eight arrests had so far been made at Canning Town and two other stations.\n\nPolice condemned the Extinction Rebellion action, but also expressed concern that members of the public had used \u201cviolent behavior\u201d to detain the train protester.\n\nA spokeswoman for prime minister Boris Johnson said the protest caused \u201cunnecessary disruption\u201d and London Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned it.\n\nSeparately, small Extinction Rebellion groups held protests against the arms trade by gluing or locking themselves to the London offices of defence companies Leonardo UK, Lockheed Martin Corp and Britain\u2019s Supreme Court, the movement said. At least seven people were arrested.\n\nPolice said on Wednesday 1,642 people had been arrested after action targeting the Treasury, financial institutions and City Airport.\n\nExtinction Rebellion says more than 1,400 of its supporters have also been arrested in 20 cities around the world since Oct. 7, including in New York, Brussels, Melbourne and Toronto.\n\nThe London protests could affect one of the city\u2019s major transport infrastructure projects.\n\nPeople look at Extinction Rebellion protesters glued onto the train at the Shadwell DLR station in London, Britain in this still image obtained from social media video dated October 17, 2019. TWITTER @MAXIMUS3005/via REUTERS\n\nTim Clark, president of Dubai-based airline Emirates, said the upsurge in climate protests may prevent the construction of a third runway at Heathrow airport.\n\n\u201cWith what\u2019s going on in and around this city I sometimes wonder if this is going to get across the final hurdle, even though the government has legislated to do it,\u201d Clark told delegates at Airlines 2050, an industry conference held in central London under tight security.\n\nA coalition of local councils, residents\u2019 and environmental groups and the mayor of London is currently pursuing a challenge against the Heathrow expansion through the appeals courts.", "description": "Climate-change activists disrupted rail services in London on Thursday, sparking a clash between angry commuters and a protester who had climbed onto the roof of a London Underground train during rush hour.", "authors": ["Matteo Moschella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441843265&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0WK", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
