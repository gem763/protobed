The new Fire HD 10 has a faster processor, a 10.1-inch FHD 1080p display, 2GB of memory, and up to 12 hours of battery life. It's available with 32GB or 64GB of storage, with added support for microSD cards as large as 512GB. Amazon now uses a USB-C port for charging and transferring content on the Fire HD 10, ditching the tired -- and slower -- microUSB port.\n\nThe Fire HD 10 has a new picture-in-picture mode that allows you to watch a show in a small window from an app like Netflix while checking your email or browsing the web.\n\nThe Fire HD 10 is still priced at $149 and is available for preorder today. It will begin shipping on Oct. 30.\n\nThere's also a Fire HD 10 Kids Edition model that comes with a two-year \"worry-free\" guarantee, a case, and a year of Amazon's FreeTime Unlimited for $199.\n\nFor the first time, Amazon is offering a Kindle that's built with kids in mind. The Kindle Kids Edition costs $109 and comes with a two-year worry-free guarantee. Amazon will replace the Kindle if your kid breaks it or it quits working for any reason.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Kindle Kids Edition also comes with a case, one year of Amazon FreeTime Unlimited -- the company's parental control and kid-oriented content platform. Kids will have access to \"over a thousand\" kid-friendly books and will be encouraged to keep reading, thanks to achievement badges as rewards for achieving reading goals on the Kindle.\n\nKindle Kids Edition is available for preorder starting today and will begin shipping on Oct. 30.\n\nAmazon is also expanding its FreeTime Unlimited service to the Fire TV stick, and eventually the Fire TV Edition smart TVs. FreeTime Unlimited on FireTV gives parents the ability to set time limits and provides access to curated kid-friendly shows. The new feature is rolling out today to the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick 4K.", "description": "Amazon's device push leading up to the holiday's isn't quite over.", "authors": ["Jason Cipriani"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/07/5d01183d-bbcf-4174-8f11-8b837d48bfc5/thumbnail/770x578/312bef995b762775e5ef430387cc3d71/b35938cb-f8c0-41f1-8179-5eb6accc3805.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
