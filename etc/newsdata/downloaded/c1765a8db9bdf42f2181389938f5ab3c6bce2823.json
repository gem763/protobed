Do something a little different.\u2019 So I put on the Afro wig. Neither time I was out there did I not do my job duties,\u201d Perryman said.\n\n\u201cI was later informed by Chief Maddox that she and the sheriff were totally upset over the Afro wig and told me that I disgraced the uniform,\u201d Perryman explained. \u201cWhen she told me that, I just got numb. Like \u2018I disgraced the uniform?\u2019 And in my mind, I\u2019m here saying that we got a sheriff running through Piedmont Park from the police like it\u2019s an episode of \u2018Cops.'\u201d\n\nHe attributes his dismissal to hypocritical behavior by the sheriff, caused by his own precarious position in the public eye. Sheriff Jeffrey Mann was charged with exposing himself in a public park. He pled guilty to both \u201cobstruction\u201d and \u201cprohibited behavior.\u201d\n\nAt the time, he insisted that he wanted to remain in his position. \u201cI enjoy being their sheriff,\u201d Mann told reporters. \u201cAnd I think I should be judged not by one error, one lapse of judgment, but what I have done as sheriff for the last four years.\u201d\n\nAnd while the early ouster is not expected to affect Perryman\u2019s pension, it will remain on his record. \u201cMy plan was to finish with the DeKalb County Sheriff\u2019s Office with 20 years of service and I got robbed from that,\u201d he said.
