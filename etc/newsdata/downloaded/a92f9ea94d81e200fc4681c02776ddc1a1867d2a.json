The video quickly drew criticism as commenters slammed the chain restaurant for selling frozen food instead of mac and cheese that is actually cooked in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cSomeone said Panera is just hospital food and this proves it,\u201d one person commented.\n\nSome online users expressed that they weren\u2019t surprised in the least by Panera Bread\u2019s apparent food preparation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get what she\u2019s exposing? Did people really think there was a chef hanging out in the kitchen of Panera Bread making their Mac and Cheese?\u201d one user tweeted. \u201cThis is literally how every fast food joint operates, don\u2019t be fooled.\u201d\n\nBacklash over the video didn\u2019t just fall on Panera Bread as the unidentified woman behind the video announced Friday on Twitter that she lost her job over it. \u201cLol i lost my job for this,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nA spokesperson for Panera Bread confirmed the video\u2019s authenticity but declined to comment further on personnel matters, according to The Washington Post. The company defended its preparation of the mac and cheese, the Post reports, which it said is a patently Panera product \u201cmade offsite with our proprietary recipe developed by our chefs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is shipped frozen to our bakery cafes \u2014 this allows us to avoid using preservatives which do not meet our clean standards,\u201d a statement said.", "description": "A woman behind a now-viral video \u201cexposing\u201d how Panera Bread prepares its mac and cheese says she was fired from the company.", "authors": ["Gerren Keith Gaynor", "Gerren Keith Gaynor Is A Digital Editor At Fox News.
