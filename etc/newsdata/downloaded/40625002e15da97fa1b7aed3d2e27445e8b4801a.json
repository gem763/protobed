He told her to pop the hood, and she found walnuts and grass piled over the engine. The couple took the car to a mechanic, who found half a trashcan\u2019s worth of walnuts under the engine.\n\nPersic said the walnuts did not cause any extensive damage, though a squirrel may have chewed through or pulled out the fuel injector hose on his new truck. The couple has gotten a quote to remove a black walnut tree from their property.\n\n\u201cFunny thing is I was thinking that for how massive the tree is, and how many walnuts have fallen (and how many dents our vehicle received), there really aren\u2019t many on the ground,\u201d Persic told KDKA.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "A Pittsburgh-area woman with\u00a0car trouble popped the hood of her vehicle to find squirrels had hidden more than 200 walnuts in the car's body.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/PASquirrelHidesWalnutsinCar-ChrisPersic.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
