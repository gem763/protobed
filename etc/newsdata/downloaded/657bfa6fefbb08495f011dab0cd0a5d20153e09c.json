His Supporters Aren't So Sure", "language": "en", "text": "When President Trump took the stage in New Mexico on Monday night, he projected confidence about his chances at winning the blue state.\n\n\u201cWe really think we\u2019re going to turn this state and make it a Republican state,\u201d Trump said onstage at the Santa Ana Star Center in Rio Rancho.\n\nBut while many of the thousands of New Mexico residents who came out to see him say they love their president, they don\u2019t share his confidence. Trump lost New Mexico to Hillary Clinton by eight points, and since he took office, his net approval there has decreased by 34 percentage points, according to the Morning Consult voter tracking poll. New Mexico hasn\u2019t gone for a Republican president since 2004, and even then, Republican George W. Bush beat Democrat John Kerry by less than 6,000 votes.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d says supporter Dwayne McFarland when asked if he thinks Trump can win New Mexico, while waiting in line hours before the rally. \u201cHe\u2019s going to turn the tide and it\u2019s going to be closer, because I think a lot of people have seen what he has done.\u201d But, McFarland laments, \u201cIt\u2019s too liberal of a state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been a Democratic state, so I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019ll be able to,\u201d says Sammy Aronow, 52. \u201cBut I think he has quite a large following here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe challenges in this state are a Democratic governor, Democratic mayors, Democratic everybody,\u201d adds Ray Evans, 63. \u201cThis is a Democratic state.\u201d Still, Ray and her friend Jan Peel, 60, say they have some hope. \u201cLook around you!\u201d Peel says, motioning to the lines of people snaking all around the arena three hours before the rally is due to start.\n\nNew Mexico may be Democratic, but the crowd in the Santa Ana Star Center was bright red. Literally. Nearly every person in the crowd was wearing at least one item of Trump gear\u2014MAGA hats, Trump campaign shirts, Trump flags draped like shawls, other t-shirts that said things like \u201cGod, Guns & Trump,\u201d \u201cAll Aboard the Trump Train,\u201d or \u201cTrump Tweets Matter.\u201d\n\nParking spots ran out hours before the rally\u2019s start time. Vehicles lined the shoulders of major roads outside the center, pulled over into the dusty shrubs, leading far away from the designated parking lots into the evening. By the time Trump arrived, the 7,000 seat arena appeared to be at capacity.\n\nOf the 13 people TIME spoke to at the rally, only two hadn\u2019t supported Trump in 2016, and that\u2019s only because they are currently nine and 17 years old, and weren\u2019t of legal voting age. \u201cHe does stuff right for our country and he does amazing stuff and he\u2019s just a person that I love,\u201d gushes nine-year-old Madison McFarland, Dwayne\u2019s daughter.\n\nRally-goers Monday night often cited the strong economy and emphasis on creating American jobs as the top reasons they supported the president. But they also said they approved of Trump\u2019s stance on the Second Amendment, his \u201cAmerica first\u201d philosophy, and what multiple people referenced as his \u201cvalues\u201d or \u201cgodly views\u201d or the fact that he\u2019s \u201ca good Christian man.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of it was misconstrued in the beginning but now the policies have been enacted, things are starting to work, and people are starting to see that he was right,\u201d says Brian Peterson, 39, of why he thinks Trump can win over more people in New Mexico in 2020. \u201cSo he\u2019s starting to change a lot of our world now, hopefully for the better.\u201d\n\nBased on internal campaign data, Trump\u2019s political advisors believe that emphasizing the economy, border security and trade will convince some of the state\u2019s Hispanic residents to vote for him. But immigration is a controversial issue for the president in New Mexico. According to U.S. Census data, 49.1 percent of the state\u2019s residents identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino.\n\nRead More: Trump\u2019s New Math: Inside the Plan to Flip Blue States in 2020\n\n\u201cHispanic Americans, they understand,\u201d Trump said Monday night. \u201cThey don\u2019t want criminals coming across the border. They don\u2019t want people taking their jobs. They want good security. And they want the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d signs peppered the stadium, and people cheered and waved them in the air when Trump said \u201cWe love our Hispanics.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s supporters at the rally were split on whether the president\u2019s hardline immigration policies and promise to build a wall along the southern border would help or hurt in him in their state.\n\n\u201cHe would have to change his complete policy on open borders in order to win this state,\u201d says McFarland. \u201cIf you look at the population of citizens here in New Mexico, most are Hispanic. They hold a lot of ties to Mexico and they want a lot of their family to be able to come over willy-nilly.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people are against the wall,\u201d says Aronow. \u201cWe have a lot of Hispanic leadership in this state and they oppose Trump.\u201d\n\nBut Eli Martinez, 46 and wearing a \u201cSpace Force\u201d t-shirt, thinks many other Hispanics in the state like the president\u2019s views on border security.\n\n\u201cBeing a Hispanic myself, I think there is a lot of support on that front,\u201d Martinez says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about race\u2026 It\u2019s about rule of law, it\u2019s about respect\u2026 There\u2019s a lot of people that are in front of the line trying to get in here legally, and then you have people that are trying to end-run that.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign staff is hammering the message with his supporters that the state can be flipped. \u201cMichigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,\u201d Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale recited to the crowd before Trump took the stage. \u201cThey said we couldn\u2019t win those states either, and we did.\u201d Gesturing to the media, Parscale added, \u201cDon\u2019t let them convince you we can\u2019t win New Mexico.\u201d\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s fans who have come to Rio Rancho hope Parscale is right, but they aren\u2019t sure. \u201cFlip a coin,\u201d John Clema, 79, says of Trump\u2019s chances.\n\nStill, a toss-up would be good odds for Trump after 16 years of New Mexico going blue.\n\nWrite to Tessa Berenson at tessa.berenson@time.com.", "description": "Thousands turned out at a New Mexico rally for Trump, but they don't share his confidence that he can win the state.", "authors": ["Tessa Berenson", "Rio Rancho"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trump-rally-new-mexico.jpeg?quality=85&crop=1061px%2C141px%2C3914px%2C2050px&resize=1200%2C628&strip"}
