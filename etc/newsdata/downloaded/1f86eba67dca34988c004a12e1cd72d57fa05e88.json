Now it's about Twitch and Telegram. The names will change, but the threat remains the same and is one that affects the entire online ecosystem,\" he said.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Social media companies scrambled on Wednesday to scrub footage of a shooting outside a German synagogue from their platforms, in the first major test of their systems since a massacre in the New Zealand city of Christchurch prompted a global outcry.
