Sexton played the first 40 minutes and Ireland led 21-0 at half-time, then Joe Schmidt wrapped him in tissue paper and popped him back in his box to keep him safe for the next game. Jack Carty came on and Ireland laboured horribly against a side who spent 13 of the next 20 minutes playing with 14 men because they had two players sent to the sin-bin. Right now, Sexton is holding this campaign together.\n\nThe Breakdown | Reffing hell: Rugby World Cup needs to clear up collision confusion Read more\n\nIreland won 35-0, which sounds better than it looked. Not least because they suffered a number of injuries along the way. Joey Carbery pulled out just before the match because he had aggravated an old ankle injury and Rob Kearney had to go off in the second half because he was \u201ca little tight in the groin\u201d.\n\nSchmidt reckons they will both be fit to play their final group match a week on Saturday. He will be more worried about Jordi Murphy, who has just joined the squad as a replacement for Jack Conan, but had to go off after half an hour. Murphy, Schmidt said, \u201cmay have popped a rib\u201d.\n\nSexton was captaining Ireland for the first time, which is a sign of how much they have come to rely on him. He made two tries, one by orchestrating a dummy loop move, which he then set up with an inside pass to Kearney, and the other by kicking a grubber for Peter O\u2019Mahony.\n\nHe nearly made three more, one with a kick that whistled across field to Keith Earls, who spilled the catch in a clash, another with a flat throw to Andrew Conway rushing up the wing (the referee called that one back because of a forward pass) and a third when he charged down a clearance.\n\nOtherwise, Ireland made a lot of mistakes, more slips, blips, misses, and fumbles than they would get away with against a better side. At one point Russia almost scored when Kearney, Conway and Garry Ringrose let the ball bounce between the three of them in their own 22. But it was the handling errors that really cost them. There were a couple of horrid knock-ons as they were closing on the try-line.\n\nIt was the 62nd minute before they got their bonus point, when Earls put Conway through after catching Carty\u2019s chip. Garry Ringrose added a fifth in the final minutes, after a crisp bit of work by Earls and Jordan Larmour.\n\nSchmidt blamed it on the humidity. \u201cSpeaking to guys who played here the last two times, the longer game goes on the more moisture there is on ball,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty realistic about how tough conditions were.\u201d\n\nEngland and Scotland had struggled at this stadium too, he said. But in truth the conditions Ireland played in weren\u2019t nearly as severe as they had been during those matches. There was a storm right before the game, and the temperature fell with the rain. It was as cool and dry as it\u2019s been in Kobe yet. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it cools off in October,\u201d Schmidt said, \u201cso I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll adjust.\u201d\n\nBut really, he needs his team to warm up.", "description": "Ireland ran in seven tries on their way to a 35-0 bonus-point win against Russia but were made to work hard by their opponents", "authors": ["Andy Bull"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9deead3a59e89c0f982b5eb81f186a832d3bb80/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e6d1446477ee33b9808e41eaa96654e2"}
