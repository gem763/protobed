They're facing a revived effort by Trump critics to name and shame them, with the apparent goal of hurting their businesses.\n\nIn one of the latest examples, a Facebook post on a page called simply \u201cBan Kenny Chesney from Pittsburgh\u201d threatened to make public a list of almost 100 local businesses in the Pennsylvania city that are owned by Trump supporters. While the page has since been taken down, a new website has been promised that will include \u201ca database of Trump supporter-owned businesses in the Pittsburgh area, as well as tips for how to get those specific businesses closed down,\u201d according to local media.\n\nEQUINOX, SOULCYCLE BOYCOTT: STEVE FORBES MAY BECOME A NEW GYM MEMBER\n\n\u201cThey want to cost people their livelihoods just because you don\u2019t agree with them politically,\u201d Sam DeMarco, Allegheny County councilman and chairman of the county\u2019s Republican Party, told the local CBS affiliate. \u201cIt\u2019s not just absurd, but I believe it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\nDeMarco continued, \u201cPeople who they just don\u2019t agree with, they want to take and punish. I absolutely believe this is a fascist behavior, and I totally reject it.\u201d\n\nA similar social media-driven boycott was directed at one of Connecticut\u2019s most popular pizza parlors.\n\nFacebook user Lorna Steele posted a message last month asking her followers to join her \u201cin no longer funding his hate,\u201d referring to Frank Pepe Pizzeria and co-owner Gary Bimonte, a Trump supporter. She posted her message alongside a picture of Bimonte holding a \u201cDeplorables for Trump\u201d sign and a message he posted thanking the president for the American steel piping being used in construction jobs.\n\nCOLORADO TOWN SUED AFTER ASKING COUPLE TO TAKE DOWN ANTI-TRUMP SIGNS\n\nSteele\u2019s post stirred a fierce debate among Facebook users, with some pledging to stop frequenting the famous pizza establishment and others arguing it is unfair to boycott individual businesses just because of their owners' political beliefs.\n\n\u201cIf we start boycotting individuals for their political views it\u2019s just as bad as a pharmacist who won\u2019t give contraception because of their \u2018principles,\u2019\u201d one Facebook commenter said, according to the Wilton Bulletin.\n\nThe push to shame Trump supporters burst into the headlines last month when Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, brother of presidential candidate Julian Castro, tweeted out a list of Trump donors and their employers.\n\n\u201cSad to see so many San Antonians as 2019 maximum donors to Donald Trump,\" Castro tweeted, along with the Twitter handles of several owners of local businesses who apparently donated to Trump. \u201cTheir contributions are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as \u2018invaders.\u2019\u201d\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN BLASTS DEM REP FOR TRYING TO NAME AND SHAME DONORS: 'DELETE & APOLOGIZE'\n\nThe tweet, however, backfired when it was discovered that one of the donors on the list also had contributed to Castro\u2019s own congressional campaign.\n\nWayne Harwell, the owner of a local real estate development company whose name appeared on the list Castro shared, told Fox News in a phone interview last month that he donated money to Castro\u2019s congressional campaign. But he suggested that after Castro outed him in his bid to shame Trump supporters, he would no longer be supporting Castro.\n\n\u201cI was also on a list of people that gave to Castro and if he dislikes me enough that he wants to put my name out there against Trump, I\u2019m not going to give money to him,\u201d Harwell told Fox News. \u201cObviously Castro feels pretty strongly against me.\u201d\n\nAlong with local businesses, major companies have also been hit with recent boycotts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFitness brands like Equinox and SoulCycle were the target of calls for a boycott after it came to light that one of the companies\u2019 biggest investors was Stephen Ross, who hosted a fundraiser for Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign in early August at his Hamptons mansion.\n\nWhile the two companies \u2013 which have long tried to cultivate an inclusive image \u2013 have attempted to distance themselves from the backlash, it was reported that both faced a deluge of membership cancellations and complaints.\n\nOther big-name brands to face a boycott backlash for having owners and CEOs who support Trump range from Home Depot and Uline to Taco Bell and Nathan\u2019s Famous hot dogs.\n\nMeanwhile, Hollywood has also reentered the fray after actress Debra Messing and her \"Will & Grace\" co-star Eric McCormack called for a media outlet to publish the names of people attending a fundraiser for Trump.\n\nThe president slammed the actress on Thursday, saying she's being accused of \"McCarthyism.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "The\u00a02020 presidential election is already getting nasty -- and not just for the candidates.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/04/694940094001_6083461196001_6083446340001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
