In the video, which has since been made private, she explained that while six years of raw veganism \u201celevated [her] consciousness,\u201d recently, her health had begun to suffer. She lost her period, she was \u201cbasically anemic,\u201d and she was riddled with digestive issues. Eventually, she said, she couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and started eating fish and eggs to alleviate her ailments.\n\n\u201cI decided to put my health first. For a while, I hadn\u2019t put it first,\u201d she said.\n\nHer followers were unsympathetic. \u201cYou must change your name. LIEvana,\u201d one commented. \u201cYou are asking others to follow a diet that almost killed you\u2026 Wow just wow!!\u201d said another. Others plastered the comments section of her Instagram posts with an unending torrent of fish emoji.\n\nMendoza was just one case in a bona fide trend of vegan influencers giving up the faith. In November 2018, vegan athlete Tim Shieff admitted in a video that he\u2019d eaten eggs and salmon, stepping down from his vegan clothing brand in the process. In January 2019, Bonny Rebecca and Stella Rae both released videos announcing their departure from eating entirely plant-based. Around the same time as Rawvana's announcement, Raw Alignment\u2019s Alyse Parker broke similar news. \u201cThe vegan YouTube community is crumbling,\u201d The Daily Beast declared in March.\n\nIt didn\u2019t stop there. In April, longtime-vegan food blogger Minimalist Baker told her 1.6 million Instagram followers that the site would start including some recipes using animal products, as its founder Dana Schultz had adopted an omnivorous diet for health reasons. That same month, actress Anne Hathaway revealed she\u2019d broken her veganism with Icelandic salmon, and that \u201c[her] brain felt like a computer rebooting.\u201d In May, Finnish vegan blogger Virpi Mikkonen told The Daily Mail that she now eats butter, meat, and goat cheese after finding out that her gluten-free, grain-free, plant-based diet was giving her menopausal hormone levels.\n\nAnd Mendoza wasn't the only one to receive hateful remarks and cries of hypocrisy after being exposed for daring to eat meat. Commenters, as well as fellow vegan YouTubers, raced to condemn all of these bloggers for straying from their beliefs.\n\n\u201cHow pathetic you are. How about a video where you explain precisely what is in chicken periods and dead fish that is going to make your health problems disappear??? Would love to see you attempt that!! You could have gone on a low oxalate diet and stayed vegan, idiot!\u201d one Instagram commenter told Bonny Rebecca.\n\n\u201cI am extremely disappointed in this and the contradiction of saying you are going to include rotting flesh recipes and then talk about honoring our bodies. You can\u2019t honor your body by poisoning it. It sounds like money was involved in this decision and for that I question morals,\u201d said another, in response to Minimalist Baker\u2019s non-vegan revamp.\n\n\u201cI am completely an [sic] utterly heart broken [sic] to hear this. And also, absolutely disgusted,\u201d another YouTube commenter replied to Tim Shieff\u2019s explanation video.\n\nIn her \"coming out\" video (which has over one million views), Bonny Rebecca said she felt \u201ca lot of shame, a lot of guilt,\u201d and \u201ccompletely lost [her] identity\u201d after breaking from rigid veganism. Some of these vloggers known for their staunch dietary principles were ostensibly eating animal products in secret for weeks or months before telling their followers. But many of them explain in their videos that they felt they had no other choice.\n\nOf course, many vegans are perfectly healthy. \u201cMost healthy people should be able to adapt to an all-plant diet,\u201d says Marion Nestle, nutritionist, professor, and James Beard Award-winning author. She emphasizes eating a \u201cvariety of plant food sources, taking in enough calories to maintain a healthy weight, and finding a good source of vitamin B12.\u201d\n\nBut Samantha Elkrief, a therapist and holistic health coach, says it\u2019s also important for vegans to monitor their protein and iron levels, and consume an adequate amount of Omega-3 fatty acids. According to the NHS, a lack of B12 and iron can cause memory problems, dizziness, and fatigue. When defecting from their plant-based diets, these bloggers and influencers claimed a variety of onset health problems such as losing their periods; skin issues, like rashes and acne; brain fog and memory loss; and digestive issues.\n\nNestle notes these problems are more associated with \u201cstarvation\u201d than a standard plant-based diet, which \u201cshould not cause people to lose weight or have any of those issues.\u201d However, Nestle adds that a diet high in fibrous plants can take time to adapt to, and people who have been advised to eat a low-fiber diet \u201cwill have problems eating a wide enough variety of plant foods to meet nutrient needs.\u201d In other words, many of these influencers may be masking disordered eating habits that are unsustainable.\n\n\u201cI have definitely seen a growing trend of influencers shifting away from veganism for health reasons,\u201d says Carina Wolff, a writer who runs the food blog and Instagram Kale Me Maybe. \u201cI think influencers specifically are dropping labels because they've found they've gotten too caught up in the rigidity of eating a certain way and it ends up being unhealthy for them.\u201d\n\nAnyone can find themselves in too deep with a diet plan, but influencers tend to be under a more specific type of pressure because their large followings (and sponsors) expect a consistent brand when it comes to their personality and posts. A Guardian feature on influencers found many \u201cfelt tied to a static, inauthentic identity,\u201d which took a psychological toll. Some influencers have even hired life coaches to help them cope with the pressure they feel to please and grow their online followings. When what you consume in your day-to-day life is the basis of this identity, the consequences can be more than just psychological.\n\nThough the Guardian called veganism \u201ca national phenomenon\u201d last year, a 2018 Gallup poll shows the amount of vegetarians and vegans in America has more or less stayed the same over the past 20 years. However, data has shown sales of plant-based groceries have increased, which points to a growing interest in healthful eating and environmentalism, plus greater access to plant-based substitutes for meat and dairy products as seen in the success of start-ups like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. In fact, recent data indicates omnivores are buying those companies\u2019 meatless burgers more than vegetarians and vegans are.\n\n\u201cVegan[ism] means you don\u2019t eat animal products. It\u2019s not by default healthier, and that\u2019s something we often forget about,\u201d adds Elkrief. She became vegetarian at age 5 and was vegan \u201cmost of [her] life,\u201d but in 2008, health issues led her to cut out more categories, like legumes and grains.\n\nTo diversify her diet, she started eating fish and eggs, and more recently, a bit of meat. \u201cI don\u2019t eat it often, I don\u2019t actually enjoy it in any way, but I\u2019m choosing to do this for my health,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so much about who you are, and following any fad is just not the move.\u201d\n\nRestrictive \u201cfad\u201d diets may not be recommended by professionals, but trendy ways of eating can be fodder for an influencer. Wolff says Instagram\u2019s hashtag-centric structure often leads influencers to make label-based diets part of their brand. After all, it\u2019s easier to search \u201cvegan\u201d or \u201craw\u201d than \u201cbalanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of these folks have been living on far more restrictive diets than simply cutting out animal products,\u201d notes vegan food and drink writer Alicia Kennedy. \u201cThese restrictions are built for failure. I know, because I once was the kind of vegan who ate mostly raw and gluten-free, because I thought that was \u2018correct.\u2019 It's not sustainable\u2014on a personal or ecological level, the latter especially for raw diets.\u201d\n\nWhile much of the criticism from their followers comes from a militant mindset toward veganism, many influencers have faced a backlash because they were (perhaps hypocritically) promoting and selling cleanses, cookbooks, and coaching programs that appeared to contradict their new diets. Indeed, in her explanation video, Mendoza describes eating a raw vegan diet, doing juice cleanses, and even embarking on a 25-day water fast. Other former vegans, like Raw Alignment and Shieff, also promoted various cleanses and fasts (including, in Sheiff\u2019s case, drinking his own urine), while people like Rebecca tried cutting out all oil and fat. Several former vegans, like Rebecca and Mendoza, say that doctors had told them to eat animal products, but repeatedly ignored this advice until their health problems drove them to desperation.\n\nReid attributes much of these restrictive tendencies to the influence of Freelee the Banana Girl, a controversial Australian YouTuber who sung the praises of a high-carb, lowfat vegan diet. She's best known for eating vast quantities of fruit in one sitting, and promotes eating only raw foods for the first half of the day. More recently, she\u2019s made multiple videos criticizing people like Mendoza as \u201cfake vegans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI work with some really popular food bloggers ... They don\u2019t eat the stuff they\u2019re putting [online].\"\n\nThese dangerously strict but allegedly \"health-conscious\" ways of eating are now referred to as \u201corthorexia,\u201d a term that its originator, Dr. Steven Bratman, defines as \u201can unhealthy obsession with healthy food.\u201d\n\nJordan Younger, a formerly vegan wellness and lifestyle blogger known as The Balanced Blonde, was one such case. She helped spread awareness of the term after realizing she was caught in a problematic cycle of \"cleanses\" and raw veganism. Younger\u2019s diet is more fluid now, but still includes some restrictions, particularly since she was given a diagnosis of the controversial condition known as chronic Lyme disease. In a blog post last September, she mentions cutting out eggs, fish, and coffee and going back to a vegan diet free from salt, sugar, and oil. Then, in late June, she discusses eating eggs again due to protein deficiencies and an \u201cinsane\u201d IBS flare-up.\n\nPeople don\u2019t only leave veganism because of health crises. Amber St. Peter, a food and wellness influencer based in southern California, says she was vegan for almost a decade, but \u201creevaluated\u201d her diet two years ago while honeymooning in Europe.\n\n\u201cI kind of just snapped,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, I can\u2019t eat anything, I\u2019m not enjoying my time, I\u2019m not doing all the things I want to be doing.\u201d Upon returning to California, she transitioned to a balanced diet of whole foods that felt more like the \u201cliteral farm-to-table\u201d way she ate growing up in Maine. She finds most foods \u201cfair game\u201d now, but still avoids soy and dairy due to allergies.\n\nInfluencers typically gain followings and sponsors for broadcasting an appealingly curated version of their everyday lives to the internet. The larger their followings get, the more they feel pressured to consistently perform certain lifestyles and incorporate the latest trends\u2014however restrictive they may be\u2014to stay relevant and unique. As Amanda Mull has written for Eater, \u201cInfluencers ... have to find a way to give audiences what we want and make it seem possible, which involves projecting a lifestyle that can\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI work with some really popular food bloggers,\u201d says Elkrief. \u201cThey don\u2019t eat the stuff they\u2019re putting [online]. They\u2019re making themselves super anxious about what they\u2019re going to post, how they\u2019re going to have time to cook and take all the pictures. I think it\u2019s really unhealthy for influencers, and [for] the people that think this is their life.\u201d\n\n\"I\u2019ve been telling people I\u2019m vegan for ten years, but really for the last four or five I\u2019ve been including animal products and I\u2019m too scared to tell people.\"\n\nA YouTube video made by Vegan Earth & Soul\u2019s Anna Reid in March 2019 chronicles at least 20 vloggers since 2016 who have made videos announcing their lapse from veganism. St. Peter, 28, theorizes one reason behind the surge of influencers leaving veganism is simply the passing of time.\n\n\u201cI feel that a lot of what personally affected me and probably affected them is just that they\u2019re realizing these black-and-white decisions that they made when they were 18 or 19 just are not applicable when they hit 30,\u201d she says. \u201cNot to say anything bad about being young, but you have so much gusto for the things you\u2019re so passionate about\u2014it doesn\u2019t necessarily involve a lot of follow-through and long-term thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea of veganism as an all-or-nothing way of being is what keeps people away from it,\u201d Kennedy says. And as these influencers find, their followers won't accept anything in between.\n\nThe most common emotions these commenters expressed were disappointment and anger, as well as the announcement that they\u2019ve now unfollowed or unsubscribed from these influencer\u2019s YouTube channels or Instagram pages. Actions like these can have a tangible impact, as influencers depend on maintaining their followings to stay appealing to brands, sell products, and make money through methods like YouTube video monetization, which can only be achieved by starting (and keeping) a notable viewership.\n\nIt\u2019s not just commenters; fellow vegan YouTubers often make videos about others in their community, and many of these former vegans found themselves the targets of critical \u201cresponse\u201d videos garnering hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nSt. Peter says she lost \u201cseveral thousand\u201d followers after breaking the news that she was changing her diet. But she didn't just receive vitriol. \u201cI\u2019d say overwhelmingly the feedback I get now is people being like, 'Oh my god, I\u2019m so glad you put that [you\u2019re no longer vegan], I\u2019ve been telling people I\u2019m vegan for ten years but really for the last four or five I\u2019ve been including animal products and I\u2019m too scared to tell people,'\u201d says St. Peter.\n\nThere are plenty of people with large online followings who were never vegan, yet still promote a wholesome, \u201cplant-forward\u201d diet, like Ali Martin of Gimme Some Oven, Lindsay Freedman of The Toasted Pine Nut, and Wolff\u2019s Kale Me Maybe. Chickpeas and vegan cheese appear on their photo grid next to fish, eggs, and even meat. Formally, this way of eating is known as \u201cflexitarianism.\u201d The New York Post reported last year one-third of Americans eat this way, and in July, Food & Wine noted that recent research concluded flexitarianism is \u201cno longer a niche lifestyle choice but a prominent feature of mainstream food culture.\u201d\n\nWolff purposefully does not label how she eats\u2014she says when she called herself \u201cplant-based,\u201d she got backlash and confusion any time she\u2019d post a non-vegan dish. However, she notes that newer approaches like intuitive eating have helped publicize ways of eating on social media that are still healthy, but label-free.\n\n\u201cWhile being vegan wasn\u2019t the right nutrition style for me, it allowed me to work through getting to that right nutrition style. And I think that\u2019s OK,\u201d adds St. Peter. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should be selling anything as 'this is the answer.' Because it\u2019s all bullshit.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got to start doing a lot more of, 'Try this, if it works for you, great. If it doesn\u2019t, also great. Try something new.'\u201d\n\nThis mentality is appears to be gaining traction. On July 24, Yovana Mendoza posted her first video in months, entitled \u201cGoodbye Rawvana.\u201d Standing on a sunlit beach, a grinning Mendoza tells the camera she\u2019s starting something new.\n\n\u201cTime has taught me so much,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to listen to my body and make the decisions that are right for me and for my health. I\u2019m not here to tell you what to do.\u201d\n\nSave for a handful of critics, the majority of the comments welcomed her back\u2014no fish emoji in sight.", "description": "Popular YouTubers like Rawvana and Bonny Rebecca gave up veganism to save their health.
