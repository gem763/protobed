(AP) - After a deep ball bounced off his hands, KJ Hamler pulled Sean Clifford aside and told his quarterback he owed him one.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Hamler to make it up to him.\n\nThe speedy wideout burned the Michigan secondary two quarters later and hauled in a perfectly thrown 53-yard touchdown pass to help propel No. 7 Penn State to a 28-21 win over No. 16 Michigan on Saturday.\n\nClifford wasn\u2019t surprised to see the nearest Michigan defender nearly 10 yards behind Hamler, who finished with six catches for 108 yards.\n\n\u201cI know KJ\u2019s fast enough to get to that weakness in their defense every single time,\u201d Clifford said.\n\nAnd the first-year starter is getting better at finding him down the field.\n\nClifford hit Hamler on a 25-yard pass to start the scoring, hooked up with tight end Pat Freiermuth for a 17-yard touchdown and ran for a 1-yard score to pace Penn State\u2019s offense.\n\nHamler also had a 100-yard kickoff return to start the second half called back on a holding penalty. That would\u2019ve come in handy as Penn State\u2019s offense went cold for much of the second half.\n\nThe Wolverines battled back from a 21-7 halftime deficit and with just over two minutes to play, had a chance to tie the game on fourth-and-goal from Penn State\u2019s 3. But Michigan wideout Ronnie Bell dropped a potential tying touchdown with Penn State safety Lamont Wade playing tight coverage.\n\n\u201cThat stop was huge,\u201d Penn State coach James Franklin said.\n\nThe Nittany Lions took control of the game early. Clifford hooked up with Jahan Dotson for 37 yards to set up the scoring toss to Freiermuth who beat Khaleke Hudson in coverage.\n\nPenn State went up 14-0 on its next drive when Clifford scored on a 1-yard run made easier by a 44-yard rush from Ricky Slade. It got easier when back-to-back Michigan offside penalties moved the ball to the 1.\n\nTariq Castro-Fields intercepted Shea Patterson\u2019s screen pass midway through the second quarter and Clifford arced his second touchdown pass to Hamler five plays later to make it 21-0.\n\nThe Wolverines cut Penn State\u2019s lead to 21-7 with an eight-play drive that burned 4:27 before halftime. It ended with Zach Charbonnet beating Penn State defenders to the end zone on a 12-yard run.\n\nCharbonnet added another 12-yard run with 1:05 left in the third to make it 21-14. Patterson, who completed 24 of 41 passes for 276 yards, plunged in from a yard out - barely - to cap the scoring in the fourth.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMichigan: The Wolverines did a solid job against Penn State\u2019s high-pressure defense gashing the Nittany Lions for a season-high 417 yards. They had all the momentum in the final quarter and had the look they wanted on the fourth down play that turned out to be the difference.\n\nPenn State: The Nittany Lions averaged 7.0 yards per play in the first half, but just 1.9 in the second until Hamler\u2019s 53-yard touchdown catch.\n\nLAUNDRY DAY\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh criticized the officiating afterward, not happy with the way his receivers were defended on the Wolverines\u2019 later possessions.\n\nMichigan was flagged eight times for 48 yards while Penn State was called five times for 58 yards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to compare some of the scenarios in the game on calls,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThought some of our receivers were getting tackled at the end.\u201d\n\nATMOSPHERIC EFFECT\n\nMichigan\u2019s offense struggled with the noise early.\n\nWith their backs to Penn State\u2019s 21,000-seat student section to start, the Wolverines lost track of the play clock and had to take a timeout before their first snap.\n\nA false start on third-and-long on their next drive foiled any chance of converting, and three offsides infractions backed Michigan\u2019s defense up and helped set up a pair of first-half Penn State touchdowns later in the half.\n\nTHE MICAH MACHINE\n\nPenn State linebacker Micah Parsons was everywhere in this game, battling through double and triple teams to lead the team with 14 tackles.\n\nUNSUNG PLAY\n\nLeading 21-7 early in the third, the Nittany Lions went three-and-out and risked giving Michigan good field position with punter Blake Gillikin standing close to his own 10.\n\nBut Penn State\u2019s specialist blasted the ball nearly 60 yards in the air and gunner Dan Chisena blew Donovan Peoples-Jones up for a loss at his own 10-yard-line. The Wolverines punted the ball back seven plays later.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nNo. 6 Wisconsin lost on a last-second field goal to Illinois earlier in the day, leaving room for the Nittany Lions to move up with the win.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMichigan hosts Notre Dame on Saturday.\n\nPenn State visits Michigan State on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After a deep ball bounced off his hands, KJ Hamler pulled Sean Clifford aside and told his quarterback he owed him one.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Travis Johnson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/michigan_penn_st_football_25451_c0-125-3000-1875_s1200x700.jpg?5df86175492ddcdc04d9d2b6261257b2d49617ee", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
