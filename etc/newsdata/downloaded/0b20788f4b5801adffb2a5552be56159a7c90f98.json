This can only be a good thing because it means that doctors can treat it as soon as possible.\u2019\n\nResearchers encouraged service providers and commissioners to \u2018consider the evidence to suggest an increase in the number of new cases in younger children\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
