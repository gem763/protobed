It's fearful and it should be concerning for all of us.'\n\nLeading the landmark class action launched by Shine Lawyers is Perth couple Reannan Haswell and Beaux Tilley. The family of five met with Erin Brockovich (right) last week\n\nPer- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, better known as PFAS, is a collection of man-made compounds looks like bubble bath.\n\nIt's present in firefighting foam used by the government and private sectors, including defence military base locations across Australia.\n\nThe Department of Defence began phasing out use of firefighting foam containing PFAS from 2004.\n\n'Defence now uses a more environmentally safe product. Furthermore, Defence has made changes to the way it uses firefighting foam to ensure that the risk of releasing the products into the environment is minimised,' the department website states.\n\n'The release of PFAS into the environment has become a concern, because we\u2019ve learned these chemicals can persist in humans, animals and the environment.'\n\nPerth couple Reannan Haswell and Beaux Tilley (pictured) have joined the historic class action\n\nThe eight locations involved in the class action include Darwin, Wagga Wagga in regional NSW, Richmond in Sydney's north-west, two Defences bases in Townsville in North Queensland, Bullsbrook in Western Australia and Edinburgh in South Australia.\n\nLeading the landmark class action is Perth couple Reannan Haswell and Beaux Tilley, who met with Ms Brockovich last week.\n\nTesting on their Bullsbrook property earlier this year confirmed their water supply was contaminated, which has seen their property value plummet.\n\nThe family of five's water use has been restricted to 150 litres sent to their home each fortnight, paid by the federal government.\n\nThey want to move but can't get approval to borrow from a financial institution due to the contamination.\n\nThe Perth family can no longer collect eggs from their chickens due to contamination fears\n\nEnvironmental activist Erin Brockovich (pictured in Brisbane last week) has backed an Australian landmark class action over PFAS contamination\n\nThe couple's property bought in 2010 is one of 11 in Bullsbrook homes so far affected, a number which is expected to grow.\n\n'It makes me sick, angry but most of all sad that any dreams we had for our property are now gone,' Ms Haswell told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'My kids' health has potentially been placed in risk through no fault of their own.'\n\n'Any equity we had on our property previously is all but gone. The only way we can sell is through a cash buyer.'\n\nThe contamination has also changed the family's way of life.\n\nReannan Haswell and Beaux Tilley brought their Perth property (pictured) in 2010\n\nPFAS is a collection of man-made compounds looks like bubble bath used in firefighting foam\n\n'Our kids can't have sleepovers or birthday parties here anymore, in fear other kids will be put at risk,' Ms Haswell told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'The kids can't play under the sprinkler or fill up an inflatable pool in summer, where it gets up to 40C here. We have timed showers and my son will only fill up his water bottle at school.'\n\nMeeting Ms Brockovich last week has made the couple more determined than ever.\n\nMs Brokervich knows a thing or two about class actions.\n\nThe former law clerk was instrumental in building a case against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California in 1993.\n\nHer successful lawsuit was the subject of the 2000 blockbuster film Erin Brockovich, where she was played by Julia Roberts.\n\n'She offered a good wealth of knowledge we really needed to remain motivated,' Ms Haswell said.\n\n'There have been so many times where we really felt like bashing our heads against a brick wall, wanting to walk away. But she told us to stay strong and keep fighting.'\n\n'Australia is behind the eight-ball when it comes to PFAS contamination, compared to the rest of the world.'\n\nErin Brockovich (pictured) has described the federal government's response as inadequate\n\nMs Haswell had this message for the federal government.\n\n'We just want what's fair and the ability to move on with our lives,' she told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nWhile the Department of Defence website states there's no evidence of human disease or clinically significant harm from PFAS, it also recommends minimising exposure to the chemical compound, which Ms Brockovich says is 'extraordinarily confusing'.\n\n'They give warnings: don't eat the fish, eat limited fish, don't drink the water \u2014 but on the other hand, you're telling people it's safe,' she told the ABC.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted the Department of Defence for comment.\n\nClass actions hearings are due to begin in April next year.", "description": "Up to 40,000 Australians who live and work on land contaminated by toxic chemical compound PFAS have joined forces to be part of Australia's largest ever class action backed by Erin Brockovich.", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/02/20308766-0-image-a-28_1572317574553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
