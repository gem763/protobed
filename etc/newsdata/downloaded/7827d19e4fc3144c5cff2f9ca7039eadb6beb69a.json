REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo\n\nBut the specter of the impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine could overshadow policy debates on the campaign trail, while threatening to imperil negotiations between the White House and senators on legislation to expand background checks for firearm purchases.\n\nAll of the Democratic candidates who qualified for last month\u2019s debate \u2013 including former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the trio setting the pace for the 19-person field \u2013 will answer questions for half an hour at the event, co-sponsored by the gun safety advocacy group Giffords and March For Our Lives, a student-led organization.\n\nThe forum is being held one day after the second anniversary of the Las Vegas massacre that killed 58 people, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.\n\nA spate of mass shootings this summer in Texas, Ohio and California, along with the everyday deaths that have made the United States an outlier among developed nations, have prompted candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination to embrace gun restrictions, a position once seen as politically untenable.\n\nBut in Washington, the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate has shown little appetite for new limits for fear of angering the gun lobby. Trump, whose election campaign in 2016 was bolstered by millions of dollars from the National Rifle Association, has offered mixed signals.\n\nThe focus in Washington has been on policies that enjoy overwhelming support among Americans, including background checks and \u201cred flag\u201d laws that allow courts to confiscate weapons from individuals deemed to be dangerous.\n\nMany of the Democratic candidates for the White House have gone further. Former U.S. Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke has called for mandatory buybacks of assault-style weapons, while Warren and U.S. Senator Cory Booker have advocated for licensing requirements.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, who has been one of his party\u2019s leading voices on gun safety since 20 schoolchildren were massacred in 2012 in his home state of Connecticut, is one of three senators, along with Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Pat Toomey, who have been negotiating with the White House on background checks. In an interview, he conceded the impeachment inquiry could prove an obstacle.\n\n\u201cClearly the White House is consumed by this growing crisis, and so I\u2019m not surprised I haven\u2019t heard from the White House on background checks for a few weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Murphy said Trump may be more inclined to support legislation to demonstrate that the impeachment investigation is not \u201cthe functional end of his presidency.\u201d\n\nMurphy said a senior administration official called him after the House of Representatives decided to open an impeachment inquiry and told him the White House remains interested in finding a compromise on background checks, despite the lack of progress in recent weeks.\n\nPeter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, noted the House has continued to hold hearings on gun safety even amid the growing impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cCongress should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd asked about the worry that impeachment will suck all the oxygen out of the Democratic primary campaign over the coming weeks and month, Ambler said: \u201cI think that\u2019s up to the candidates. I think what the voters want to hear from the candidates is obviously not ignoring impeachment, but not being obsessed with it.\u201d\n\nAt a remembrance event in Las Vegas on Tuesday, however, several residents said they feared impeachment would stand in the way of progress on gun violence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned,\u201d said Wendy Starkweather, 70, clad in a red \u201cMoms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America\u201d T-shirt. \u201cWe had a lot of momentum going. It\u2019s going to be hard for any issue.\u201d", "description": "Ten of the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination will gather in Las Vegas on Wednesday for an all-day forum on gun violence, tackling an issue that has increasingly become a chief concern for their party's voters.", "authors": ["Joseph Ax", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436193612&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910MV-OCATP"}
