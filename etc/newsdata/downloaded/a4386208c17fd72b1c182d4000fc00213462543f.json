Only time will tell if the pairing of these two MVPs will be the push this team needs to finally win another championship.\n\nUntil then everyone in the organization insists that it will work because Harden and Westbrook want it to.\n\n\u201cIf Russ got it going and Russ is on one of those games we\u2019ve all seen before, guess what I\u2019m going to do? Sit back and watch the show,\u201d Harden said leaning back and crossing his arms.\n\nWestbrook also insisted that he isn\u2019t the least bit worried about how they\u2019ll mesh playing together for the first time since Harden was traded from the Thunder after the 2012 season. Westbrook, an eight-time All-Star, listed all the ways he can impact the game aside from scoring, reeling off all his skills from rebounding to being a leader.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to me and James playing together, who\u2019s going to have the ball, who\u2019s not going to have the ball, it really doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cMy goal is to win a championship so whatever it takes to do that that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nCoach Mike D\u2019Antoni was quick to point out that not too long ago there were similar concerns about how Harden would adjust to playing with Paul. Those worries soon dissipated when Houston won a franchise-record 65 regular-season games and reached the Western Conference finals in Paul\u2019s first season with the team in 2017-18.\n\n\u201cIt works itself out,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cYou try not to over-coach it. We need Russell to be Russell. We don\u2019t want to change him. He\u2019s an MVP.\u201d\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta, the billionaire restaurant and casino owner, recalled seeing Westbrook play against the Rockets last season.\n\n\u201cI watched Oklahoma kick our butts twice last year and there was this guy that would get a rebound and have it dunked on the other side when our guys started to run down the court,\u201d Fertitta said. \u201cAnd I thought what would it be like to have this guy on our team?\u201d\n\nNow that he is, Fertitta has high expectations for what he and Harden can do this season.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m really excited, so I hope they don\u2019t let me down,\u201d he said.\n\nSome things to know about the Rockets as they start camp.\n\nVETERAN PRESENCE\n\nThe Rockets signed veteran center Tyson Chandler this summer in hopes of improving their rebounding and to take some of the load off starter Clint Capela. Chandler, who\u2019ll turn 37 next week, was the second overall pick in the 2001 draft.\n\nWhen Chandler started his career his goal was to play for 10 years and he never dreamed he\u2019d play nearly twice that long.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m wearing 19 this year. I came in at 19. This is my 19th season,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine being here. I wear it on my chest because I feel blessed and fortunate to be here.\u201d\n\nMOST FASHIONABLE TEAM EVER?\n\nNow that Westbrook has joined a team that already had style stars Harden and P.J. Tucker, the Rockets could be the most fashionable NBA team ever.\n\nWestbrook laughed when asked if he thought that was the case before he got serious.\n\n\u201cProbably so,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I think about it probably so.\u201d\n\nTucker, who is often referred to as the league\u2019s Sneaker King, also has impeccable style and was seen on the front row at many of the shows during fashion weeks in New York, Paris and Milan this offseason. So when a reporter asked if he\u2019d need to step his fashion game up now that Westbrook was on the team he was taken a bit off guard.\n\n\u201cStep it up? Nah, I\u2019m good,\u201d he said smiling.\n\nPlayers have been photographed for several years entering the arena in their designer outfits. But with the style star power on this team, Harden joked that they might have to take that ritual up a notch this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a runway,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a red carpet. We\u2019ll have music. We\u2019ll have the whole nine yards. So be ready for it.\u201d\n\nD\u2019ANTONI\u2019S CONTRACT\n\nThe Rockets weren\u2019t able to work out a contract extension with D\u2019Antoni this offseason, leaving him with just one year left on the deal he signed when he joined the team in 2016. Despite the inability to come to terms on a new deal, Fertitta isn\u2019t concerned about D\u2019Antoni\u2019s future with the team.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great coach,\u201d Fertitta said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the great offensive minds out there. I truly do not see Mike going anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe 68-year-old D\u2019Antoni is 173-73 in three seasons in Houston.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "James Harden isn't listening to anyone who is worried about how things will work in Houston with the addition of Russell Westbrook.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/rockets_media_basketball_12283_c0-170-4070-2543_s1770x1032.jpg?d32bb410ed4cff152f20dbcc82b11d192608d6d1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
