Green on the field prior to a game against the Buffalo Bills at New Era Field. Mandatory Credit: Mark Konezny-USA TODAY Sports\n\nGreen has yet to play in a game this season since sustaining an ankle injury in July. The seven-time Pro Bowl selection was limited in practice last week before failing to participate in this week\u2019s sessions.\n\n\u201cIf I can go, I can go,\u201d Green said, via the Dayton Daily News. \u201cIf I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s no big thing. Like I said from Day 1, if I\u2019m healthy enough to play then I\u2019m going to play. Right now, I still have a ways to go.\u201d\n\nGreen\u2019s name has been tossed about as a potential target prior to the trade deadline, although Bengals coach Zac Taylor was definitive last week that the star wideout won\u2019t be dealt.\n\n\u2014The New York Jets followed up on their threat and fined guard Kelechi Osemele for conduct detrimental to the team after he missed practice, according to multiple media reports.\n\nOsemele, who is listed as doubtful for Monday night\u2019s game against the New England Patriots, has been involved in a dispute with the team regarding the severity of his shoulder injury and had been planning to undergo surgery to repair a torn labrum and miss the rest of the season. Osemele plans to file a grievance, as the team believes he can play through the injury and delay surgery.\n\nESPN reported Osemele was at the team\u2019s facility Saturday, a day after the Jets notified him he would be fined or suspended if he didn\u2019t practice.\n\n\u2014Patriots wide receiver Josh Gordon was officially ruled out for Monday night\u2019s game against the Jets, after missing his third straight practice.\n\nGordon hurt his left ankle and knee on Oct. 10 in the Patriots\u2019 Thursday night win over the New York Giants. The injuries are not believed to be serious, but Gordon was expected to miss at least a game or two.\n\nAlso absent for the Patriots will be tight end Matt LaCosse (knee), while wide receivers Julian Edelman (chest) and Phillip Dorsett (hamstring) are both questionable after practicing on a limited basis all week.\n\n\u2014The NFL fined Los Angeles Rams linebacker Clay Matthews, Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield and Detroit Lions safety Tracy Walker $12,500 each after publicly criticizing officiating last week.\n\nMayfield and Walker were fined for post-game comments Sunday, while ESPN reported Matthews was cited for a tweet posted Monday, during the Detroit Lions\u2019 controversial loss to Matthews\u2019 old team, the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\u201cThe storyline for the 2019 season continues to be the refs inability to make the accurate and correct calls week in and week out. Al Riveron continues to blindly side with his refs and the current status quo. Something must change! Zero accountability,\u201d Matthews tweeted.\n\n\u2014The Tennessee Titans activated first-round pick Jeffery Simmons to the 53-man roster in time for Sunday\u2019s game against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nSimmons, who tore his left ACL during pre-draft workouts in February, was selected by Tennessee with the 19th pick in the 2019 NFL Draft out of Mississippi State. The defensive end practiced all week.\n\n\u2014The Chargers did not activate left tackle Russell Okung before 4 p.m. ET, meaning Okung will have to wait until at least Week 8 to make his season debut.\n\nOkung announced Thursday he was returning after spending the first six weeks on the reserve/non-football injury list while recovering from a pulmonary embolism that sidelined him since June.\n\nOkung practiced Thursday and Friday, though his level of participation is unclear.\n\n\u2014Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle Jarran Reed was activated to the 53-man roster ahead of Sunday\u2019s game against the visiting Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe Seahawks also placed tight end Will Dissly on injured reserve to make room for Reed, who was suspended for the first six games of the season for violating the league\u2019s personal conduct policy.\n\n\u2014The Philadelphia Eagles activated cornerback Jalen Mills from the physically unable to perform list ahead of their Sunday night matchup at the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nMills is expected to start Sunday after practicing this week. It\u2019s taken nearly a year for Mills to recover fully from a foot injury sustained in Week 8 of 2018.\n\n\u2014The Green Bay Packers upgraded wideout Geronimo Allison\u2019s condition from doubtful to questionable following practice.\n\nHe was in the concussion protocol after getting hurt in Monday night\u2019s win against the Detroit Lions. He also sustained a chest injury.\n\n\u2014The Kansas City Chiefs have swapped defensive tackles, signing Mike Pennel and releasing Terrell McClain, according to a report from ESPN.\n\nPennel, 28, has yet to appear in a game this season, released by the Patriots in August. For his career, he has appeared in 69 games (15 starts) between the Packers and Jets.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J.
