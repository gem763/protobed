The cumulative effect of this uncertainty has led to car manufacturer Toyota pausing car production in the UK, while house price growth halted in August. Business confidence is also low, with a steep fall in lending to businesses and evidence of the worst decline in the car industry since 2001.\n\nAll other advanced economies performed better than Britain in the second quarter of 2019. Canada topped the G7 with strong growth of 0.9 per cent in the second quarter. The US and Japan both posted solid, if unspectacular, growth of 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.\n\nBack in 2015, the then chancellor George Osborne proudly declared that Britain was \u201cgrowing faster than any other major advanced economy\u201d after the UK outpaced the rest of the G7 in 2014. The present chancellor, Sajid Javid, cannot make such a boast when he presents the government spending review this week. The UK\u2019s second-quarter contraction was partly caused by stockpiling in the run-up to the original Brexit deadline at the end of March. This has dragged the economy down.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

No one knows whether we are coming or going. It is time to take the bull by its horn and sort it before 31 October, otherwise the country will face mayhem.\n\nBaldev Sharma\n\nHarrow\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That\u2019s a joke right?\n\nThe democracy protesters are to be offered the chance to come and live in the UK under an unelected PM with a track record of offensive comments to minorities: a man who as mayor of London purchased an illegal water cannons and who still has the jammy smear of Garden Bridge corruption clinging to his wobbly jowls.\n\nThis defeats irony.\n\nAmanda Baker\n\nEdinburgh\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with leaving without a deal?\n\nI had a vote given to me by the then administration of David Cameron on 23 June 2016.\n\nI exercised this right to vote Leave.\n\nIn 2017, the same government with Theresa May at the helm then triggered Article 50, meaning that on 29 March we would leave the EU.\n\nWhen I voted, I voted to leave. Article 50 provided the mandate that if we had no deal by 29 March then we would leave without a deal.\n\nI, like millions of others that voted, am still happy to leave. We knew what we voted for then, we still know what we want now, and with the anti-democratic institution that is most of parliament, and of Remainers, I am more resolute now than I was ever before that we need to come out on 31 October.\n\nAs a newspaper, you have a responsibility to report both sides.\n\nKaren Smith-Anscombe\n\nAddress supplied\n\nNo deal was never on the table\n\nJames Gordon on Sunday 1 September in the Letters page said that people did vote for a no-deal Brexit because Theresa May said \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. However, this was at the general election where she lost her majority.\n\nIn 2016, none of the Leave campaigns even mentioned the possibility of no deal. The people voted in 2016 for Brexit that was sold as a positive thing for the country where we could have a great deal, and therefore you cannot honestly state they voted for it when it wasn\u2019t even mentioned.\n\nNicki Bartlett\n\nCardiff\n\nWe need a general election\n\nBritain is a shining beacon of parliamentary democracy. It prides itself throughout history as the mother of all democracies. Each party has put their spirited and passionate argument before the people and the British people have voted to leave the European Union in a free and transparent referendum.\n\nTheir will must therefore be respected. However, Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend the parliament in the midst of the Brexit furore is a misguided decision. It rips democracy apart and threatens the political and social fabric of our society. A general election remains the only way out of the present impasse.\n\nDr Munjed Farid Al Qutob\n\nLondon NW2", "description": "With uncertainty about Brexit and utter confusion over\u00a0no-deal Brexit thanks to Boris Johnson\u2019s antics, the UK has fallen to the bottom of the G7 growth table.
