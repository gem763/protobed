The same policy will apply to investment advisers on November 4. (Wall Street Journal)\n\nTalking point: Charles Schwab was the first brokerage to slash commission fees last week, leading others rushing to hold on to customers by following suit. E-Trade Financial and TD Ameritrade have also cut their fees, and Interactive Brokers has announced plans to do the same. It\u2019s a major shakeup for the industry\u2014Vanguard is now the last major U.S. broker to charge for online trading. For TD\u2019s Ameritrade, which generates about 16 per cent of its revenue from commissions, the move would reduce shares by about 40 per cent, all else being equal\u2014but it looks like a necessary move to stay competitive, given the industry\u2019s rapidly shifting landscape.
