Huge, I know.\n\nAfter five years in Australia, Sephora are finally setting up shop in Adelaide\u2019s glorious Rundle Mall.\n\n\u201cEvery time we announce the opening of a new Sephora location we are inundated with requests for an Adelaide store from our South-Australian-Sephora-Super-fans,\u201d Beth Glancey Sephora Australia & New Zealand GM said. \u201cWe have been eagerly waiting for the perfect location on Rundle Mall for some time now. We are excited that we are only weeks away from bringing the fun, dynamic and inspiring Sephora retail experience to our clients in Adelaide.\u201d\n\nAnd the store isn\u2019t just a regular old Sephora, no. This is a COOL Sephora, unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n\u201cWe are bringing a whole new concept to Adelaide, it\u2019s nothing you would have seen in any other Sephora in Australia. There will be a big focus on Sephora Services with three beauty studios, a Benefit Brow Bar and the first dedicated Skincare Studio in the country. It\u2019s so exciting to think that when we open we will be bringing the likes of Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, tarte, Huda Beauty, Sephora Collection, Fresh and Marc Jacobs Beauty to Adelaide for the very first time. The opening is only a few weeks away and we can\u2019t wait to get there.\u201d\n\nAdelaide has many things, but unfortunately makeup stores are not on that list. While the city has a couple of Mecca stores, there are a plethora of Sephora-exclusive brands that aren\u2019t available anywhere in Adelaide.\n\nWhile online shopping is a total godsend, when it comes to makeup shopping, it can be really hard. Physical stores make it easy to test products, colour match and just browse stuff IRL.\n\nWe don\u2019t have an exact date just yet, but Sephora will open it\u2019s doors in Rundle Mall before the end of October. Christmas shopping just got 100 times easier for all of your makeup-loving friends and family members.", "description": "Adelaide's iconic Rundle Mall will be home to makeup retailer, Sephora's first South Australian flagship store, opening in October 2019.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/spehora.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
