(Tiziana Fabi/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Vatican\u2019s criminal prosecutors have requested the indictment of a priest accused of abusing an altar boy at a youth seminary steps away from St. Peter\u2019s Basilica \u2014 a rare case involving claims of abuse within the city-state\u2019s walls.\n\nA Vatican statement Tuesday said prosecutors were also seeking an indictment of the youth seminary\u2019s former rector for \u201caiding and abetting\u201d the alleged abuse.\n\nThe indictments indicate that the church is moving forward on a case reportedly covered up for years, though the Vatican did not say when a trial might begin, nor did it provide details about the accusations against the Rev. Gabriele Martinelli and the former rector, the Rev. Enrico Radice.\n\nCritics of how the Catholic Church has handled abuse cases will be watching to see how transparent the Vatican process will be.\n\nThe allegations of abuse at St. Pius X Pre-Seminary date to 2012. They were reported first by Italian journalists in 2017 and then by the Associated Press last year.\n\nAccording to the AP, teenage altar boy Kamil Jarzembowski accused an older seminarian \u2014 Martinelli \u2014 of molesting his roommate. Several bishops investigated, the AP said, and yet the victim was never interviewed and police were never called in.\n\nUltimately, Jarzembowski was kicked out of the seminary, while Martinelli was made a priest.\n\nIn correspondence with The Washington Post this year, Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, a Pope Francis critic and former Vatican ambassador in Washington, highlighted the case as an example of the church hierarchy\u2019s inadequate response to abuse allegations.\n\n[He called on the pope to resign. Now this archbishop is in an undisclosed location.]\n\nVigan\u00f2, citing \u201cfirsthand information,\u201d said a preliminary investigation carried out by a priest was inhibited by superiors. Vigan\u00f2 said Jarzembowski and two other seminarians described the accusations in writing to cardinals and, in 2014, to Pope Francis.\n\n\u201cOne of the victims was a boy, allegedly abused for five consecutive years, starting at age 13,\u201d Vigan\u00f2 said.\n\nThe request for indictments comes shortly after an August article in Il Messaggero, the major Roman daily, said local prosecutors were wrapping up their own investigation into \u201csupposed acts of abuse\u201d at the youth seminary.\n\nFrancesco Zanardi, an Italian survivor of clergy sexual abuse and president of the Abuse Network, said his association had helped Jarzembowski file charges with the district attorney\u2019s office in Rome.\n\nThe Vatican, in its statement, said the indictments are possible because Francis in July granted a special provision for the matter to go forward, circumventing statute-of-limitations constraints.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018The pope ignored them\u2019: Alleged abuse of deaf children on two continents points to Vatican failings\n\nWhen the Vatican faces a major sex-abuse scandal, he\u2019s the man the pope sends in\n\nThe Vatican, not known for transparency, actually has abuse statistics buried on its website\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The case concerns the alleged abuse of an altar boy at a youth seminary steps away from St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.", "authors": ["Chico Harlan", "Rome Bureau Chief Covering Southern Europe", "Sometimes Parts Beyond", "Stefano Pitrelli", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/u8TkyB1JiHP4E_Erbu8yzf1I8NU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DSYAHDGZRYI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
