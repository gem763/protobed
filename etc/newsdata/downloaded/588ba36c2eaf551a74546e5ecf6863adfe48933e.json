They are still sunbathing on the beaches and still swimming in the sea. It is as if nothing has changed in paradise.\n\nYet 40 minutes away by plane, on the Abaco Islands, heaven turns to hell. The Mudd, a shantytown that was home to the Bahamas\u2019 biggest Haitian immigrant community, has been obliterated by Hurricane Dorian as if by a massive bomb.\n\nRelated: 'We have to give paradise a hand': Dorian aid operation proves a huge logistical challenge\n\nOn Thursday a bare, crooked tree reminiscent of a desert wasteland was one of the few things still standing. Every dwelling had been destroyed. Cars were overturned. The ground was a wasteland strewn with blankets, clothes, fridges, shoes, rusty nails, splintered plywood, toilets and toothbrushes. The size of several football pitches, the Mudd was peopleless; no one knows how many died here and how many evacuated.\n\nNatural disasters often expose the gap between the haves and have nots and Dorian was no different. While the Bahamas has a reputation as one of the most desirable tourist destinations on earth, its luxury hotels and homes depend on a life support system of fishermen, hotel workers and laborers. Once again, it is the poorest who have been hardest hit when catastrophe strikes.\n\nPeople walk among debris at the Mudd neighborhood, devastated after Hurricane Dorian hit.

We\u2019ve just created our own structure and there hasn\u2019t been any attempt to integrate.\u201d\n\nHaitians have lived in the Bahamas for centuries but face poverty and prejudice, for reasons including religious beliefs that can include voodoo. A 2008 article in the College of the Bahamas Research Journal, entitled the Stigma of Being \u2018Haitian\u2019 in the Bahamas, noted that \u201cBahamians have long \u2018looked-down\u2019 on Haitians as not being social equals\u201d.\n\nThe Mudd was built by thousands of Haitian immigrants over decades in Marsh Harbour on Abaco. But it was wiped out in hours, its flimsy wooden structures standing little chance against the wrath of Dorian. American emergency workers have found five bodies in the debris and expect more to come.\n\nOthers fled and are unaccounted for. Some have evacuated by boat to Nassau. Some sought refuge in places such as the pink-walled New Haitian Mission Baptist church. At one point 210 Haitians gathered on its bare concrete floor, without electricity or running water. Now there are 45, including two children.\n\nCharles Ilfrenord, its pastor, who moved from Haiti 35 years ago but still has family there, said: \u201cPlenty of people died in the Mudd. I think more than 1,000.\u201d\n\nA man rests at the Full Gospel church in Sand Banks, 9 September 2019 in Great Abaco Island, Bahamas.

I had to swim to get a boat to put my family in. We pulled it slowly down the road for a half a mile.\u201d\n\nThe family were temporarily blinded by fumes from a nearby oil and diesel plant, Timothy added, but they found shelter in a government building.\n\nTimothy\u2019s wife, 31-year-old Kenya, and their four children were evacuated by a boat that was taking women and children only. Timothy is now sleeping rough in a roofless building and struggling for food. \u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for jobs and for something to do,\u201d he said.", "description": "The tourist destination relies on a life support system of fishermen, hotel workers and laborers.
