George Barker, no one filed to run against Democrats Ebbin, state Sen. Dick Saslaw, Del. Mark Levine or Del. Charniele Herring by the deadline in June, so theirs are the only names that will appear on the ballot next month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Commonwealth Republican Women\u2019s Club determined that this would not do.\n\n\u201cThe frustration of Alexandria\u2019s moderates and conservatives is palpable,\u201d said the club\u2019s Linda Greenberg, who sent out the sole announcement that the four were throwing their hats into the ring. \u201cWe were unhappy with the fact that there were all these [seats] and nobody we could vote for.\u201d\n\nAlexandria and the surrounding region typically votes about 80 percent Democratic. Describing the incumbents as \u201cextreme liberals,\u201d Greenberg said the lack of Republican opposition \u201cpains our patriotic hearts.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that if any of the candidates were to mount a serious campaign, they would have to sink some money into the effort, put their lives on hold, and file statements of organization and campaign finance reports with the state. They would also have to cut vacations short, as the election is a mere two weeks away.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI am two-thirds of the way through a six-week vacation in Portugal and Spain. I return to the USA on November 4,\u201d Gerald D. Chandler, 77, who is running against Herring to represent the 46th District, wrote in an email response to an inquiry about his candidacy. He described himself as a conservative, free-market supporter who thinks that \u201call levels of government interfere too much in peoples lives.\u201d\n\nHe wants more charter schools, more respect for those with \u201cnon-liberal ideas on same-sex marriage \u2026 more facts and less emotion to influence how Blacks are treated and relation between races. I think that the charge of racism has become so common that it is almost meaningless.\u201d\n\nMiller said she, too, had been on an overseas vacation for a portion of the fall, but she was newly returned and happy to talk about why the General Assembly needs more state senators devoted to \u201cfamily values,\u201d higher academic expectations at local schools and fewer abortions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNeither Peter Benavage, who is running against Saslaw, nor Eileen Marie Brackens, who is challenging Levine, responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe candidates do not have the endorsement of the local Republican Party, chairman Sean Lenehan said, because the party\u2019s understanding of state law is that any statement of support \u2014 including the cost of issuing a news release, postcard or sample ballot \u2014 would have to be reported as a campaign donation, which would require the candidates to file statements of organization and campaign finance reports with Virginia\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a reflection on the people or the process or the group or anything else,\u201d Lenehan said. \u201cWe want to abide by the laws.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Alexandria Republicans, annoyed by unopposed Democrats, have launched low-key campaigns.", "authors": ["Patricia Sullivan", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Other Regional Issues In Arlington County"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YkgLlylmkSOsEQb6i9aPhdWm098=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MV2Y6HCVUUI6NNSSGFNOLVGU3U.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
