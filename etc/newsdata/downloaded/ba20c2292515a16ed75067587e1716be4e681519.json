Cover with plenty of boiling water, stir once and simmer for 20-25 mins, until tender but still with a little chew and \u201cbite\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, peel and finely grate the ginger, finely chop 1 peeled garlic clove, remove seeds and slice the chilli.\n\nTrim the french beans. Slice each one into 3 or 4 pieces, at an angle. Roughly chop the coriander, stalks and all.\n\nRemove the green radish leaves. If any still seem perky, keep them to one side. Slice the smaller radishes in half and larger ones into quarters.\n\nPut a wok on to heat. Add the mirin, 2 tbsp water, radishes and a pinch of salt. Cook on a high heat, stirring often, for 3 to 4 mins, until the liquid has reduced to nothing.\n\nThe radishes should be partly cooked but still have a slight bite to them. Remove from the heat and keep to one side.\n\nSeason the pork with salt. Heat 1 tbsp oil in the wok. When hot, add the pork and beans. Stir-fry for 3-4 mins, until the pork has coloured and the beans softened.\n\nAdd the ginger, garlic, chilli and radishes (plus any reserved leaves). Fry for 30 secs before adding the teriyaki sauce and 2 tbsp water. Fry for 1 more min, until the sauce has reduced and looks glossy. Drain the rice, remove the star anise and serve with the pork, beans and radishes. Garnish with chopped coriander.\n\nRecipe from Riverford.co.uk", "description": "Teriyaki\u00a0pork and braised radishes with green beans and\u00a0star anise rice Prep and\u00a0cook: 30 mins Serves 2 It may seem odd to cook a radish, as we are so used to eating them raw.
