He said he still had 'some concerns' about specifics of the agreement.\n\nAs of last night, just 12 of the 28 Spartan MPs had publicly backed Mr Johnson's (pictured) deal\n\nBut John Baron, one of 28 'Spartan' MPs who voted against Theresa May's deal three times, said the terms of the new deal suggested that the UK could still end up with a No Deal Brexit when the transition period finishes in December 2020.\n\nHe said: 'We're seeking assurances, the devil is in the detail still, but the reason I am inclined to vote for this one is very simple. Theresa May's backstop could have had us locked into that arrangement indefinitely.\n\n'Boris Johnson has torn up that backstop, which means if the trade talks are not successful, after we hopefully agree the deal here... we could leave on No Deal terms.'\n\nRemainers leapt on Mr Baron's statement yesterday, with the People's Vote campaign for a second referendum claiming it showed that the Government was not sincere about wanting a trade deal.\n\nThey suggested hardline Brexiteers were instead preparing for a No Deal Brexit when the transition ended.\n\nThe support of the Spartans is critical to the Prime Minister's hopes of getting the deal through the Commons.\n\nHowever one senior Eurosceptic was pessimistic about Mr Johnson's chances yesterday, saying: 'There will be a hardcore of the hardcore who vote against \u2013 probably enough to be fatal.' Privately, ministers agree that a small number of longstanding Eurosceptics, including the former Cabinet minister Sir John Redwood, will never be persuaded to back the deal.\n\nThey fear that others, such as former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson, may be swayed to vote against the deal by their relationship with the DUP.\n\nMr Johnson has privately warned MPs that they will have the whip suspended if they fail to back his deal \u2013 the same punishment meted out to 21 Tories who voted with Labour to block No Deal last month.", "description": "Members of the European Research Group of Conservative MPs will meet at Westminster this morning to decide whether to support the agreement before today's crunch vote in the Commons.", "authors": ["Jason Groves Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/22/19903498-0-image-a-25_1571432545244.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
