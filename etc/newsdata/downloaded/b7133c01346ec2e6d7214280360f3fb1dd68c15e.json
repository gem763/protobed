(A word that for Americans in Europe has often read as dingy.) Instead, the work done has made the hotel a sort of blend between a comfortably modern if unremarkable international aesthetic in the bedroom and a classic London feel outside, in the lobby, and in some fantastic public guest spaces. Thus, it is the latest selection for our series on exciting new or restored hotels, The New Room with a View.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m tall or like air conditioning in metro cars in the middle of summer, but I\u2019ve never loooooved the Tube (although I am a massive fan that its turnstyles take Apple Pay so I\u2019ll never have to wait at a kiosk again), so the Academy Hotel\u2019s central location just around the corner from the British Museum and my personal favorite the Wellcome Collection is ideal. And, despite being on a street that runs parallel to the madness of Tottenham Court Road, the hotel\u2019s block is shockingly quiet.\n\nAs for the rooms (55 in total, starting in $200s), they are more in the international corporate aesthetic than what you\u2019d expect from a boutique English hotel\u2014but that\u2019s what they were aiming for and I understand how this would appeal to some frequent travelers or those traveling for the first time who might not want a place that experiments too much. But the essentials were there\u2014decent sized rooms, not too cluttered, comfortable beds, and large shower.\n\nBut I suspect that perhaps the part that really sold me on the Academy Hotel during my visit is something a significant number of guests at the hotel don\u2019t see or take advantage of (and that certainly goes in totality for the general public).\n\nTucked away around the corner from the lobby is the Alchemy Bar, and while I\u2019m not a big drinker, I could while away hours in its sitting area under an indoor striped tent awning. And just beyond in the private courtyard created from the backyards of the combined townhouses is an oasis of calm unlikely to be found in Central London.", "description": "The newly renovated Academy Hotel in London is a charming blend of modern and historic, and has a hidden oasis.", "authors": ["William O Connor", "Travel Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_2998,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1566721386/190825-oconnor-the-academy-hotel-london-hero_jjdqa5"}
