An early goal is not the best thing that can happen, but sometimes it makes one thing clear \u2013 game on.\n\n\u201cThe game \u2013 I loved. It was a super game. That\u2019s how football should look and how we should play against a strong, really well-organised side.\u201d\n\nSpurs goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga made a series of brilliant saves before Henderson struck a deserved equaliser after 52 minutes.\n\nGoalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga impressed for Spurs (Peter Byrne/PA)\n\nKlopp said: \u201cWe played really good football, created chances in the first half and second half.\n\n\u201cSuper saves from the goalie, wow. What a game he had.\n\n\u201cThen the first goal we scored, I loved. In other games, when the striker goes down there are shouts for a penalty and players switch off, but Hendo was not bothered and finished it off nicely.\n\n\u201cThe second goal was after a sensational counter-press from Sadio (Mane), having the ball, losing it and then the opponent kicks your calf.\n\nB O S S \ud83e\udd17 pic.twitter.com/fi6vtNrSS8 \u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cWe won it, we deserved it and I\u2019m really happy about the performance.\u201d\n\nSalah, who has now scored eight goals this season, was substituted late on as a precautionary measure.\n\nKlopp said: \u201cIt was the ankle. He has struggled since the Leicester game. The longer the game goes and you get a knock and feel it more, it makes no sense to push it through, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\u201d\n\nSpurs\u2019 defeat left them 11th in the table and without a win in the Premier League for a month.\n\nTottenham have not won in the league since the end of September (Peter Byrne/PA)\n\nManager Mauricio Pochettino said: \u201cThere were different phases during the game I think we played well.\n\n\u201cBut when we scored so early, the team tried to defend and we missed a little bit to play. In the first half it was difficult to connect the play and go forward and dominate.\n\n\u201cIn the second half the game was under control. We started creating some chances but we didn\u2019t score.\n\n\u201cWhen you concede, you know Anfield pushes the level of the team and in the end we conceded the penalty. We need to improve a lot and, of course, we\u2019re a little bit disappointed. We competed but we need to keep pushing.\u201d\n\nPochettino defended Serge Aurier after conceding the penalty that allowed Liverpool to go ahead.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think I am happy with him. Of course he is not happy, but no-one is happy. It is normal you make the penalty and you feel you are guilty, but it is not like this.\n\n\u201cI think it is a moment to be all together and show our support.\n\n\u201cTechnically maybe it is penalty because there is a contact but, to be honest, the ball is going away. It is very soft.\u201d", "description": "The Reds fell behind to a Harry Kane goal in the first minute against Tottenham.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/wire-20258852-1572216852-712_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
