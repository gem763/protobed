That\u2019s nothing new. But the last two innings, it\u2019s just not right. It\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nHe said he was eager to get back to Philadelphia and the great fans there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got 60,000 fans up in Philly that appreciate me as a player, appreciate me as an individual and my family, as well,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI owe a lot to those people up there in Philly because they show up for me every single night and they\u2019re there to cheer us on and boo us and keep us going as a team and as individuals as well.\n\nHarper left Washington after playing 927 games over seven years, participating in six All-Star Games and winning the 2015 NL MVP Award. He\u2019s been a target of boos since signing a $330 million, 13-year contract with the rival Phillies.\n\nWashington has already clinched an NL playoff spot.\n\nIn the teams\u2019 first matchup in April, the boos by Nationals fans started when Harper\u2019s name was announced in the lineup, and derisive shouting followed during a video montage of his biggest moments with the Nationals. Harper was then booed at every at-bat, and when he took his position in right field, several fans were wearing white shirts that spelled out T-R-A-I-T-O-R.\n\nHe got a bit of retribution with a 458-foot homer that he punctuated with a bat flip.\n\nHarper acknowledged he heard the boos in April, saying: \u201cFor me, that\u2019s part of sports, part of the game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Philadelphia Phillies slugger Bryce Harper called out some Washington Nationals fans, saying they crossed the line heckling him in the eighth inning.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Harvey Valentine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/phillies_nationals_baseball_03988_c0-217-5173-3233_s1770x1032.jpg?d26e0ff4619c643e1cb9de978cd3235e2332f6ab", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
