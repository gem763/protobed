(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)\n\nYou know that the Milwaukee Bucks will be offering Giannis Antetokounmpo a supermax contract extension at the first available opportunity, which is after this season. I know that the Greek Freak will be getting that supermax offer. We all know it. To quote \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d: It is known.\n\nBut it\u2019s not something the Bucks can actually come out and admit, at least not yet.\n\nOn Tuesday, the NBA fined Milwaukee $50,000 for \u201cfor violating league rules governing the timing of discussions regarding future player contracts and permissible commitments to players.\u201d In essence, the Bucks are being punished for tampering with their own player after General Manager Jon Horst admitted during a town hall on Sept. 12 that the team planned on offering Antetokounmpo the supermax.\n\n\"What is the situation with Giannis' long-term contract?\"\n\n\n\nJon Horst answers: pic.twitter.com/a6O4uAaoIE \u2014 FOX Sports Wisconsin (@fswisconsin) September 13, 2019\n\nThe best part about Horst\u2019s answer to a fan\u2019s question about the status of Antetokounmpo\u2019s long-term contract situation is that the GM started off by saying he can\u2019t talk about it but then, well, talked very specifically about it.\n\n\u201cThe answer for right now is we can\u2019t talk or negotiate anything,\u201d Horst said. \u201cGiannis, basically a year from now, will be eligible for a supermax extension. At that time, of course, he\u2019ll be offered a supermax extension.\u201d\n\nBoth the sanction levied by the NBA on the Bucks and the misdeed itself are small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, obviously, but it was handed down at a time when the NBA is looking to crack down on tampering. Last week, the league\u2019s Board of Governors approved a series of new guidelines \u2014 including increased financial penalties \u2014 designed to cut down on illegal pursuits of players and salary-cap circumvention.\n\nThe moves were spurred by recent free agent feeding frenzies that saw players change teams within moments of the start of free agency. NBA rules state that free agents cannot communicate with possible suitors until June 30 and cannot sign new contracts until a seven-day moratorium has passed. Nevertheless, NBA teams and players had already agreed to more than $3 billion worth of new agreements by July 1 this year, fueling the notion that the deals had been worked out well before the starting gun.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, teams that reach agreements with players before the start of the designated signing period can be fined up to $6 million.\n\nAt a news conference on Friday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the new rules were created to establish a \u201clevel playing field\u201d in free agency for all 30 teams, though unnamed NBA observers told The Post\u2019s Ben Strauss that the increased punishment will not end tampering.\n\nAntetokounmpo will be eligible for a contract worth $253.8 million, the largest in NBA history, from the Bucks next summer because he meets certain veteran requirements as laid out by the collective-bargaining agreement. Milwaukee will offer him such a deal to ward off potential big-market suitors such as the Golden State Warriors, who \u201chave always been the big threat to go after Giannis,\u201d ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne said last week.\n\nSo maybe that $50,000 fine the Bucks got for letting their star player know their plan is money well spent.\n\nRead more:\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox\n\nIn diverse Toronto, the Raptors\u2019 sports hijab is hailed as a win for inclusivity\n\nSpain teaches USA Basketball a lesson about the value of commitment\n\nAfter 15 years, 10 teams, three titles and one devastating knee injury, Shaun Livingston retires", "description": "The league isn't messing around with the tampering situation, apparently.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead", "September At Am", "Matt Bonesteel Spent The First Years Of His Washington Post Career Writing", "Editing.
