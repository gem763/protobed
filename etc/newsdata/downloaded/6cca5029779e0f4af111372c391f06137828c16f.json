Trump's reported potential choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf. Wolf, the group asserts \"is an unqualified flack for big business who has a terrible track record of putting corporate interests ahead of the needs of American workers.\"\n\nIn a statement sent to Townhall, IFPTE argued that Wolf \"has no problem separating U.S. workers from secure and good-paying employment and driving down wages for U.S. engineers and other skilled workers\" because of his support for \"the deeply flawed H1-B visa program.\" As explained by the union, \"H1-B visas, abused by companies like Disney, Pacific Gas and Electric and Uber, allow U.S. firms to replace U.S. workers with low-cost employees who come to the U.S. from overseas by falsely claiming a \u2018shortage\u2019 of necessary skills and experience.\"\n\nThe group adds that Wolf is \"is a longtime dweller of the very swamp that Donald Trump once promised to drain.\"\n\nIndeed, both traditionally leftist organizations such as IFPTE as well as MAGA-hard liners -- those most supportive of President Trump's illegal and legal immigration policy -- argue that Wolf would not be supportive of President Trump's overall immigration plan.\n\nAccording to political analyst Ryan Girdusky, many within the administration feel that Wolf would thwart Trump's agenda. Girdusky says that most MAGA supporters want acting United States Citizenship and Immigration Services director Ken Cuccinelli to be named head of DHS.\n\nGirdusky first reported that Wolf was being considered for the job, while also noting that legal experts disagree whether or not Cuccinelli could be named DHS chief, acting or otherwise.", "description": ".10/25/2019 12:02:45PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/45/7aa82c82-1cef-4f2e-8ceb-3e14f11477a8.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
