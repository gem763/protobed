We\u2019re talking to experts and testing products ourselves to get those precious eight hours a night. Photo: Courtesy of vendors\n\nAt the end of a long day, completing a multi-step skin-care routine may be the last thing you want to do \u2014 but if you reach for one product (after washing your face, of course), there are some very compelling reasons to go for a night cream. According to dermatologist Dr. Michele Green, \u201cNighttime is the restorative time for your skin, so you should give your skin the extra TLC by using a night cream.\u201d She says night creams \u201caddress different concerns than daytime moisturizers \u2014 typically, they provide intense hydration and concentrated ingredients to fight signs of aging and other concerns.\u201d We heard similarly from dermatologist Noelani Gonzalez, the director of cosmetic dermatology at Mount Sinai West, who says that night creams tend to be thicker than daytime moisturizers, use exfoliators to improve skin texture, and contain more hydrators to replenish moisture lost during the day (so you wake up looking less tired and puffy). They also contain ingredients like retinol, which shouldn\u2019t be used during the day.\n\nLike many classic skin-care products, there are many night creams to choose from. Generally speaking, Gonzalez suggests looking for one with hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and ceramides for hydration, retinol as an acne fighter and anti-ager, or antioxidants like resveratrol for protecting against environmental stress. \u201cGlycolic acid also helps exfoliate and renew, and niacinamide helps with redness for those with conditions like rosacea and acne.\u201d Here, we asked ten dermatologists and facialists for their recommendations on the ones that are worth the money, the ones that fight acne, and the ones that might help slow down early signs of aging.\n\nBest overall night cream\n\nCeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream Gonzalez and dermatologist Debra Jaliman \u2014 an assistant professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine \u2014 both suggested this drugstore CeraVe night cream, which Jaliman says delivers comparable results to much more expensive options. She calls out the ceramides and hyaluronic acid in it as excellent hydrators, plus the niacinamide as a trusted redness reducer. \u201cThis is an excellent moisturizer for when the weather starts getting cold and your skin starts losing more moisture,\u201d she says. Facialist Jordana Mattioli named the cream as a favorite, too. \u201cFor normal to combination skin, CeraVe PM facial moisturizing lotion has a non greasy texture with brightening niacinamide and skin restoring ceramides,\u201d she says. It\u2019s also one of the more affordable night creams on this list \u2014 so two dermatologists\u2019 and a facialist\u2019s rave reviews and a price tag that will let you stock up makes this one best overall in our book. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest night cream for sensitive skin\n\nBurt\u2019s Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream $16 (was $18, now 11% off) Certain sensitive-skin types might prefer a more natural option, and for them, Gonzalez recommends Burt\u2019s Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream. \u201cIt\u2019s great for those with sensitive skin, and the product doesn\u2019t test on animals or use animal ingredients.\u201d From $16 at Amazon Buy From $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest night creams for acne-prone skin\n\nCetaphil Rich Hydrating Night Cream $12 (was $20, now 40% off) Green told us this cream from Cetaphil is a safe bet for acne-prone skin \u2014 and it also came up when we talked to dermatologists about their recommendations for moisturizers for mature skin. Dr. Francesca Fusco, a dermatologist at Mount Sinai, told us that Cetaphil can \u201chydrate skin without clogging pores,\u201d which would also make it a great pick for those struggling with breakouts. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nBiologique Recherche Creme Dermopurifiante Kim Zimmerman, of Rescue Spa in Philadelphia, suggests Biologique Recherche Creme Dermopurifante for those with acne-prone skin. \u201cIt allows your natural oil production to flow in and out of the pores, so that the skin stays moisturized sans breakouts,\u201d she says. $96 at Rescue Spa Buy\n\nTammy Fender Intensive Repair Balm \u201cTammy Fender\u2019s Intensive Repair Balm is a good choice for problematic and acne-prone skin,\u201d Larissa Thompson, founder of ONDA Beauty. \u201cIt has Helichrysum which is prized for its healing and medicinal actions. This cream provides intense moisture while also calming inflamed skin and speeding up the healing process.\u201d $130 at Saks Fifth Avenue Buy $130 at ONDA Beauty Buy\n\nBest night creams for dry skin\n\nAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream Zimmerman recommends Augustinus Bader\u2019s The Cream, which comes in two formulas \u2014 one for normal to oily skin, and one for dry skin \u2014 for \u201cthe laziest nights when you don\u2019t have time to slather on a million serums, but you still want all the anti-aging benefits.\u201d It\u2019s quite the science-y product with equally high-tech claims: \u201cIt taps into epigenetics, which activates the body\u2019s own stem cells to regenerate and repair the skin while you sleep,\u201d says Zimmerman. The price tag is high, but as Rio once pointed out, it\u2019s a very coveted cream, and Kathleen Hou at the Cut wrote that when she tried the cream it made her skin look \u201chealthier, sort of like there was a good bra holding things up under it.\u201d From $170 at Violet Grey Buy\n\nNo7 Beautiful Skin Night Cream Dry/Very Dry For something at a much lower price point, Jaliman recommends this one from No7 for replenishing moisture: \u201cThis night cream has shea butter, glycerin, and ceramides, which are perfect ingredients for someone in need of a highly hydrating moisturizer.\u201d $15 at Target Buy\n\nMG Skin Labs Absolute Recovery Anti-Wrinkle Cream Green also told us about the anti-wrinkle night cream she formulated, which has rose extracts and Ginkgo Biloba. \u201cIt restores, tightens and firms skin to help prevent the signs of aging,\u201d she says. The cream also contains essential fatty acids, which protect skin from environmental stressors, and helps give skin a more youthful glow. $75 at MG Skin Labs Buy\n\nBest night cream for normal/combination skin\n\nOlay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream Here\u2019s another in the drugstore range. Gonzalez and New York City\u2013based dermatologist Hadley King \u2014 a clinical instructor of dermatology at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University \u2014 suggested this one for its hydrating elements. \u201cIt has antioxidants, green-tea extract, and a peptide-B3 complex, which helps hydrate and exfoliate skin,\u201d says Gonzalez. $21 at Amazon Buy $21 at Amazon Buy\n\nSkinceuticals Renew Overnight Dry If you have combination skin, Gonzalez says this SkinCeuticals cream is a solid choice for exfoliating and moisturizing. \u201cWith alpha hydroxy acids, glycolic and lactic acid, aloe vera, and essential oils, it soothes dry skin, boosts skin radiance, and reduces the appearance of lines.\u201d $61 at Dermstore Buy\n\nBest retinol night creams\n\nSkin Better Science Intensive AlphaRet Overnight Cream Retinol is a pretty well known anti-aging product, and Green told us that it\u2019s also useful for those with oily skin. \u201cLook for products that contain retinol to facilitate cell turnover to unclog your pores,\u201d she says. \u201cIn addition, retinol helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Retinol also tightens the pores which makes oily skin look less shiny.\u201d If you want to try a night cream with retinol, we heard good things about Skin Better Intensive AlphaRet Ovenight Cream from Karp, who says, \u201cI love this because it is a non-irritating retinol \u2026 that has glycolic and lactic acid in it, which help lighten dark spots and exfoliate the skin. You can apply a thin layer over your whole face at night.\u201d We also heard about Skin Better\u2019s night cream from Mattioli, who says the cream has \u201can amazing combo of retinol and glycolic acid in a mix of moisturizing antioxidants, and it\u2019s hydrating enough for almost any skin type \u2026 perfect for mature skin to firm and soften wrinkles.\u201d $120 at Skin Better Science Buy\n\nCeraVe Anti Aging Serum For a less expensive option, Karp also likes CeraVe\u2019s Skin Renewing Cream Serum, which, as its name suggests, is a hybrid product that\u2019s both serum and cream. \u201cIt also contains hydrating ingredients like ceramides and niacinamide,\u201d Karp says. \u201cNiacinamide also helps with redness and is well tolerated by most skin types. With this, you would also apply a thin layer over your whole face at night.\u201d She also notes that those with extra sensitive skin will want to avoid this one. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nLernberger Stafsing Night Cream Jessica Richards, owner of Shen Beauty, named this night cream from Lernberger Staffsing as one to try. \u201cIt contains hyaluronic acid, evening primrose and retinol,\u201d she says, calling it a \u201cgame changer\u201d for \u201chelping to reduce fine lines and wrinkles and leaves your skin incredibly supple when you wake up.\u201d $72 at Shen Beauty Buy\n\nSkinMedica Age Defense Retinol Complex $79 (was $93, now 15% off) For the person who\u2019s going all-in on night creams, Gonzalez adds that this pricey, yet results-oriented, SkinMedica Age Defense Retinol Complex has a little bit of everything: \u201cRetinol for anti-aging, niacinamide (which has been shown to be anti-inflammatory in clinical trials and to enhance the skin\u2019s barrier function), essential oils, and antioxidants to help smooth skin and give it a more rejuvenated look.\u201d $79 at Dermstore Buy\n\nRoC Retinol Correction Deep Wrinkle Night Cream Gonzalez and Jaliman like this RoC night cream. A big perk is that this one\u2019s formulated in a tube versus a jar, so it has a longer shelf life, but also retinol and glycolic acid for smoothing skin. Jaliman considers it a dupe for the much more expensive Strivectin Advanced Retinol Intensive Moisturizer: \u201cSimilar ingredients, very different price points.\u201d $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest natural and organic night creams\n\nGoop Replenishing Night Cream Both Richards and Larissa Thompson, founder of ONDA Beauty, sung high praise for Goop\u2019s night cream. Thompson notes that the cream has botanical and mineral benefits that exceed those which you would find in a drugstore moisturizer. \u201cPlus, you\u2019re getting all the healing and nutritional benefits from the plant ingredients,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cThink of it as eating right for your skin. But topically.\u201d Richards suggests layering it over Goop\u2019s face oil for added hydration. \u201cYou will notice, plump, brighter and more hydrated skin,\u201d she says. $140 at Goop Buy $140 at Shen Beauty Buy\n\nHeart of Gold Moon River Renewal Balm For a slightly different spin on what we might traditionally think of as a night cream, Melanie Herring loves Moon River Hydrating Balm. The balm, which Herring calls \u201ctruly magic in a jar\u201d and her \u201cgo-to,\u201d packs frankincense resin to increase cell turnover and calm inflammation, as well as shea, sal, and cupuacu butters for sealing in moisture. And the list of powerful natural ingredients doesn\u2019t end there: \u201cCamellia and meadowfoam are beautiful for protecting the skin from free radical damage, infusing the skin with powerful antioxidants,\u201d says Herring. \u201cRose stimulates collagen, moisturizes and is a powerful anti-inflammatory ally. Elemi, which is derived from a tree, is a powerful cell regenerator, toning and firming skin.\u201d $77 at Heart of Gold Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
