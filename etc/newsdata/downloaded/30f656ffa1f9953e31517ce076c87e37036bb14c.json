It was valued at US$47 billion earlier this year.\n\nDespite the company's breakneck growth, there are investor concerns over a mismatch between its cash flow and liabilities, given that it rents workspace to clients under short-term contracts, but pays rent for them itself under long-term leases.\n\nNew York-based We Company, founded in 2010, saw its revenue double to US$1.54 billion in the first half of this year, though its losses were 25 per cent higher during the period than a year earlier, at US$900 million.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Garage - [NEW YORK] WeWork owner The We Company took some steps on Wednesday to burnish its appeal to investors ahead of its initial public offering by adding a woman, Frances Frei, to its all-male board and announcing that its CEO would return a US$5.9 million payment for use of the trademarked word \"We\". .
