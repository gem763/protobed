The reports initially sent major stock indices and the\n\nChinese yuan slipping, but losses were pared as it became\n\nclearer that a decision on such moves was not imminent. On\n\nSaturday a U.S. Treasury official said such ideas were not being\n\ncontemplated \"at this time\".\n\n\"The tensions between the U.S. and china are certainly now\n\nmulti-dimensional,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior forex strategist\n\nat National Australia Bank in Sydney. \"It's not just about trade\n\nor buying more soy beans...it's about the structural tensions\n\nthat exist between those two countries.\n\n\"Now there is a capital war angle,\" he said, adding that\n\ncurrency market reaction was modest, because the ideas were only\n\nproposals.\n\nTraders are expecting fewer trade-war headlines during the\n\nweek, Catril said, since China has a week-long holiday beginning\n\non Tuesday, which marks the 70th anniversary of the People's\n\nRepublic of China.\n\nThe Chinese yuan CNH= , the most sensitive to trade\n\ntensions, trod water at 7.1361 per dollar in offshore trade\n\nahead of the release of Chinese factory activity surveys around\n\n0100 GMT.\n\nThe figures are expected to show a fifth straight month of\n\ncontraction. Against a basket of currencies the dollar was flat\n\naround 99.100. The dollar greenback firmed a little against the\n\nAustralian and New Zealand dollars. The kiwi slipped\n\n0.2% $0.6280 after a gauge of national business confidence fell.\n\nThe Aussie edged down to $0.6764.\n\nFinancial markets 0#YIB: are now pricing in a better-than\n\n70% chance of the Reserve Bank of Australia reducing the cash\n\nrate for the third time this year to 0.75% at its Oct. 1 board\n\nmeeting, while most economists also expect a cut. RBAWATCH\n\n\"There is a view to sell AUD on the idea the RBA is to cut,\"\n\nsaid Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone\n\nGroup in Melbourne.\n\n\"(But) given what's priced, if the bank cut, the AUD\n\ndownside should be limited. So, the extent of any selling will\n\nalso be driven by the RBA's tone and outlook,\" he said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Dollar supported as fears of ramp up in Sino-US trade war ease", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6N142_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
