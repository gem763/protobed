The teen and one of the adult accused were in court on Thursday for a prospective bail application.\n\nNjomane's body was found in the boot of a burned out government car in Blue Downs on August 18.\n\nThe teen appeared in court on Thursday with his mother sitting close to him as his responsible guardian. He stood a distance away in the dock from one of his co-accused, dressed in old, but neat clothing.\n\nHis co-accused indicated to the court he had decided to get a lawyer after originally opting to speak for himself. A tattoo of a crown containing the number 26 was visible on his neck when his T-shirt shifted as he held his hand up.\n\nThe adults may also not be named, filmed or photographed, by court order.\n\nThe case was postponed to Friday in the same court for a social worker to prepare a report on the teenager relating to the latest charge against him.\n\nIt is understood he is wanted for the alleged gang-rape of two school girls who were walking across a field last year.\n\nTwo people have already been arrested in that case, and Kuils River police had been searching for him to add him to the case.\n\nThe court also granted two members of Njomane's family permission to attend the case on condition that they do not mention the teenager's name to anybody.\n\nThey had made a special request to the court because it is sitting in camera.\n\nThe boy's mother had objected to them being allowed to be present because they would see what she looked like, and possibly threaten or harm her on her way out of the court building, she believed.\n\nThe court heard that although this was her fear, she had not been threatened by them, so it gave the family permission for two people to attend the in camera sessions on condition that they do not also threaten or harm her.\n\nThe teenager and the adult had been expected to bring a bail application on Thursday but the new charge against the minor and the adult's decision to get a lawyer led to the bail application being put on hold.\n\nThe other three accused will appear via a prison AVR feed in November.\n\nThe teenager and the adult will appear again on Friday for a bail application and after that, the teenager will appear with his two co-accused in the rape case.", "description": "The teenaged co-accused in the case of the murder of a soldier in Cape Town also faces a rape charge in a different case.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8207/3f53f3970553472d86340242ae9e9ade.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
