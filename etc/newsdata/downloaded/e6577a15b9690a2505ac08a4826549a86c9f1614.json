Then you may have to pay up to \u00a34,600 more", "language": "en", "text": "The grass might not always be greener on the other side but if it is, then the homes nearby will be worth more.\n\nThat's the conclusion of a study that suggests homebuyers will pay an average premium of up to \u00a34,600 to be near green spaces.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics' analysis of more than a million property sales in England and Wales confirms how much city dwellers value their parks and allotments.\n\nHouses and flats within 100 metres of public green space such as parks, allotments, golf courses and playing fields were 1.1 per cent, or \u00a32,500, more expensive on average than they would be if they were more than 500 metres away in 2016.\n\nPopular: Homebuyers value being near to green spaces when living in a city, study shows\n\nBut that premium rises even more in the case of detached home, or if the property has actual views onto parks or water such as rivers, canals, lakes or the sea.\n\nIn 2016, a detached home within 100 metres of a green space would cost on average 1.9 per cent more than similar homes 500 metres away - although a flat was only 0.6 per cent more expensive.\n\nBut having a view over a green space or water boosted house prices by the most, an extra 1.8 per cent, or an average of \u00a34,600.\n\n'Our analysis shows living near parks, gardens and playing fields or having a view over green space or water can have a real positive impact on the price of your house and the nearer the green space is, the higher the premium,' said Adam Dutton of the ONS.\n\n'We are continuing to uncover and improve our measurements of the ways in which nature impacts on people's health, wealth and well-being in the UK.'\n\nProperties with actual views onto parks or water can attract an average premium of \u00a34,600\n\nIn 2016, a detached home within 100 metres of a green space would cost on average 1.9 per cent more than similar homes 500 metres away\n\nThe study analysed property sales from website Zoopla between 2009 and 2016 and used Ordnance Survey's open greenspace data, gathered using maps and aerial imagery.\n\nPublic parks or gardens, play spaces, playing fields, sports facilities, golf courses, allotments or community growing spaces, and religious grounds and cemeteries were included.\n\nHowever woodlands, heaths and other open spaces that people might use for recreation were not.\n\nPublic parks or gardens, play spaces, playing fields, sports facilities, golf courses, allotments or community growing spaces, and religious grounds and cemeteries were included\n\nThe closer the green space, and the more there is, the higher the premium\n\nDavid Westgate of Andrews Property Group said: 'It may not quite have the impact on prices that proximity to a tube station has, but being close to an open space does push up values, all the more so if a property overlooks them.'\n\nHe continued: 'It goes without saying that where most nearby properties have been converted into flats that lack gardens, the local park becomes even more important, and that too can drive up prices.\n\n'Town planners 120 years ago got it right and the creation of open green spaces continues to have huge appeal for local people and exert a material influence on values.'", "description": "The Office for National Statistics' analysis of more than a million property sales in England and Wales confirms how much city dwellers value their parks and allotments.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
