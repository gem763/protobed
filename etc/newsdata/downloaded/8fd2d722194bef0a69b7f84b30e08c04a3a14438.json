His work focuses on the intersections of community engagement, strategic communications, and policy advocacy within Asian American communities.\n\nDuring the most recent Democratic debate, candidate Andrew Yang responded to a line of questioning on health-care incentives with the joke, \u201cNow, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors.\u201d It was a quip that may have seemed innocuous to some in the audience, but it\u2019s not landing with Asian Americans across the country.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time Yang has tried to sell himself by calling on ostensibly positive Asian stereotypes. During the previous debate, for example, he claimed that \u201cthe opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math\u201d \u2014 by which he meant himself. He even sells a hat in his online store that reads \u201cMATH\u201d and a shirt that reads \u201cI \u2764 MATH.\u201d\n\nWith such seemingly simple self-deprecating remarks, Yang is reinforcing the model-minority myth \u2014 the idea that some populations are substantially better off than others, particularly Asian American communities in the United States. It\u2019s a premise calibrated to make him palatable for non-Asians. But it\u2019s also dangerous and exploitative. While Yang\u2019s campaign purports to be a step forward for Asian Americans, his reliance on stereotypes sets us back, making it harder to grasp the struggles and dilemmas that many in our community face. In the process, he is also reinforcing more overtly negative ideas about other nonwhite communities.\n\n[Harvard Univeristy and the myth of the model minority]\n\nThe model-minority myth refers to the perceived higher level of success of a community writ large. It took root in the 1960s, during a crucial turn in U.S. history \u2014 the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. In the wake of that shift, observers increasingly began to point to Asian American communities as pinnacles of achievement and excellence, of what nonwhite communities \u201ccould be.\u201d\n\nWriting in the New York Times in 1966, the sociologist William Petersen coined the term \u201cmodel minority\u201d to describe the post-World War II rise of Japanese Americans, even in the face of ongoing prejudice. He contrasted their success to that of what he called \u201cproblem minorities\u201d (a term that he set in quotation marks that clearly pointed toward black Americans), groups pulled down by oppression to the point where they would greet even equal opportunity with \u201ceither self-defeating apathy or a hatred so all-consuming as to be self-destructive.\u201d\n\nWhatever Petersen\u2019s intentions, this contrast exposes the real function of the model-minority myth: It rests not on the laurels of Asian American success, but of black oppression and perceived cultural failure. As the scholar Vijay Prashad puts it in \u201cEverybody Was Kung Fu Fighting: Afro-Asian Connections and the Myth of Cultural Purity,\u201d the myth\u2019s \u201cimplication is that blacks want special treatment and believe themselves to be entitled to something more than other Americans.\u201d That idea ensures that for every scene of protest, every battle for liberation and every march for basic human rights that black Americans have waged in the past few decades, there is a convenient foil to point to. A foil that allows those in a position to do something about injustice to instead ask, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be more like them?\u201d\n\nYang is repurposing the model-minority myth \u2014 used by dominant white powers to divide communities of color and pit Asians against blacks and other \u201cproblem minorities\u201d \u2014 to curry favor with a broader base of voters to whom he might have otherwise been less palatable. Ironically, by reinforcing the idea that all Asians are doctors or good at math, Yang is erasing the very real issues that communities within the expansive Asian American umbrella must deal with. Although aggregate education levels show that Asian Americans are overperforming in the United States, less than 1 in 5 Hmong, Cambodian, Laotian and Bhutanese people attain a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Across outcomes \u2014 poverty, health care and more \u2014 there are stark differences within Asian American communities that the model minority myth elides.\n\nYang\u2019s embrace of the model-minority myth extends beyond everyday rhetoric, also finding a home in his proposed policies. This includes the signature proposal of his campaign, universal basic income. At its core, universal basic income can be seen as a path of upward mobility for those confronted by structural barriers, enabling people to further their education or find better jobs. For Yang, universal basic income also serves as the answer to the impending threat of workplace automation.\n\nHowever, Yang\u2019s attempt to frame UBI as the answer to other major challenges of our time \u2014 including climate change and health care \u2014 still relies on the idea that Americans should be able pull themselves up by their bootstraps and make a better life for themselves. His plan would give people a choice: If they want to collect $1,000 a month, they have to decline other essential public assistance benefits \u2014 from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to disability insurance.\n\nThe idea here is that everyone should be able to succeed under the same conditions and with the same kinds of support. But despite his love of math, Yang should know that his own calculations don\u2019t add up: Like the fiction that some minorities can simply get by better than others, his plan ignores the very real systemic barriers to communities of color or those in poverty. Although an additional source of income can surely make a difference in the lives of many Americans, it would not work at the expense of programs Yang wants to cut, which strive to eliminate some of the very real barriers facing Americans.\n\n[No, record players won't solve inequality]\n\nNevertheless, Yang seems to believe that with a little help in challenging circumstances, all Americans can be like the highly educated Asian Americans who began to immigrate to the United States after 1965. It\u2019s a fantasy that makes it seem far easier to break the shackles of institutional racism and generational poverty than it ever has been.\n\nIf this is hard to recognize, it may be precisely because Yang has embodied the model-minority myth throughout his public persona and campaign. We see this in Yang\u2019s response to Shane Gillis, who has made homophobic and racist comments, particularly directed at Asian Americans, including Yang himself. Instead of echoing the outrage, Yang suggested that we should be \u201cforgiving\u201d to Gillis and offered to \u201csit down and talk\u201d with the comedian. Yang further compared the relatively subdued anger at anti-Asian \u201cjokes\u201d to the more \u201cimmediate and clear\u201d reaction that would have probably ensued had Gillis used the n-word. In effect, Yang is further amplifying oppression Olympics by comparing the discrimination and prejudice faced across communities of color \u2014 the very thing the model-minority myth has long worked to spotlight and naturalize.\n\nFor every successful Asian American businessman Yang claims to represent, for every Asian American doctor Yang claims to know and for every proclamation of his love of math, Yang deepens the acceptance of the model-minority myth into the collective American consciousness.\n\nIf Yang wants to advance Asian American life as he purports to do, he should be working to dismantle the model-minority myth, not activating age-old tropes to connect to voters. He could probably stand to shake things up: Given his dismal poll numbers, his strategy clearly isn\u2019t working, anyway.", "description": "His quips reinforce stereotypes \u2014 and hide real problems.", "authors": ["Alton Wang", "Alton Wang Is A Community Organizer Based In Los Angeles", "Is Currently A J.D.
