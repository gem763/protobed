While at work today at Boys & Girls Clubs, I learned from the Madison Teachers Union President that School Supt. Jane Belmore has rescinded the decision of my termination,' Anderson exclaimed on Facebook.\n\n'I will be placed on paid administrative leave and my transition plan is being negotiated. I will continue to work at the Club until we negotiate my return back to the district.'\n\nScroll down for videos\n\nMarlon Anderson (right) announced Monday that he would be allowed back at West High School in Madison, Wisconsin soon after his firing was rescinded. He is working at the Boys & Girls club in the meantime with CEO Michael Johnson (left)\n\nHe thanked the '1,000 plus students for allowing your voices to be heard' in a walkout to help reinstate him (pictured)\n\nThe security guard said he understood the intent for the school's zero tolerance policy but said 'it's too rigid', 'too lazy' and they need a solution that works for all\n\nHis son had organized the protests that helped reinstate him.\n\n'Thank you to the 1,000 plus students for allowing your voices to be heard and to all the people from across the globe for reaching out to my family,' Anderson continued on Facebook. 'Thank you MTI, West BSU, my son, Noah Anderson and my colleagues at West High School for your prayers and support. You are amazing people!'\n\nIn an interview Monday, Anderson, who is dependent on insulin, called the nightmare 'probably the most humbling experience I've had in my life' and said he was proud of students for fighting on his behalf.\n\nBut he thinks the zero-tolerance policy needs to be refined.\n\n'I understand the intent for it, but it's too rigid,' he told NBC 15. 'It's too lazy. It needs to be addressed. It needs to be dealt with. You're dealing with people with PhDs. You're educated people. You can come up with a solution that works for everyone.'\n\nBut he must wait to get back into the role.\n\n'I hope even that process can get expedited because I miss the kids,' he told NBC 15.\n\nAnderson called the nightmare 'probably the most humbling experience I've had in my life' and said he was proud of students for fighting on his behalf\n\nThe security guard said he understood the intent for the school's zero tolerance policy but said 'it's too rigid', 'too lazy' and they need a solution that works for all\n\nMichael Johnson, the CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of Dane County asked the district to 'put together a committee of students, teachers, educators and leaders of color to rewrite the behavior policy to ensure that context matter so both students and school staff are protected'.\n\nHe joined the likes of union Madison Teachers Inc. and Madison School Board President Gloria Reyes in asking MMSD Interim Superintendent Jane Belmore to reinstate Anderson.\n\nReyes had penned in a letter to Belmore: 'We are at a critical time in this community and in our nation where racial inequality and racism continues to persist and we must continue to fight against the injustices of our past, present and future.'\n\nReyes added that 'we would never excuse the deep pain of this hateful, violent language, regardless of intent' but 'It is important that we do not harm those that we are trying to protect'.\n\nIn a statement to staff, Belmore said she is 'prepared to take appropriate steps in the current situation, and I will begin to work with our administrative team to ensure that we mitigate any harm that was caused and begin the healing process and give the board time to review our practice'.\n\n'Our commitment to anti-racism and to use the input from community, especially our students is unwavering,' Belmore said.\n\nSinger Cher had also shared in a tweet that she would 'incur' Anderson's legal fees if he chose to sue the Madison Metropolitan School District.\n\n'How can people be this disrespectful?' Cher asked in a Friday tweet. 'A beloved man of color just passed and our nations mourning him. Congressman Elijah Cummings fought for justice. He was loved and feared. If you want to sue MMSD Ed. Board, I will incur your expenses.'\n\nThe protest was organized by the West Black Student Union at the school and led by Anderson's son, Noah.\n\nStudents walked from the school to the school district offices where Noah spoke on the difference of using the word as a slur versus as a statement.\n\n'What my father did is take a teachable moment from an African American male to a younger African American male. Why he shouldn't use the word and not refer to himself that way?' Noah said, WMTV reports.\n\nAnderson thanked his son Noah Anderson (pictured), who staged the walkout, and his colleagues at West High School for 'your prayers and support'\n\nIn this October 17, 2019 photo, Marlon Anderson poses for a photo in Madison, Wisconsin\n\nCher shared in a tweet that she would 'incur' 48-year-old Marlon Anderson's legal fees if he chose to sue the Madison Metropolitan School District\n\nNoah added that the walkout was just the beginning in getting the community to become more inclusive.\n\n'There has been tension in the MMSD for a while, and my dad just had to be a sacrifice for it. We're going to get it fixed - especially with all the support that we see,' Noah explained.\n\n'We started with what we want as students and that we want our voices to be heard. Anytime you make any type of decision and that they need to go into the communities - anytime they make a decision that affect a certain group of people.'\n\nIn a brief Facebook post made last Wednesday, Anderson shared that he was fired from the Madison Metropolitan School District on October 9.\n\nHe claimed that a student repeatedly called him a 'b***h a*s n***a.'\n\n'I responded 'do not call me n***a !' And I got fired,' Anderson said in the post that has been shared more than 500 times and has more than 1000 shares.\n\nIn a brief Facebook post made on Wednesday, Marlon Anderson shared that he was fired from the Madison Metropolitan School District\n\nHe explained to the Wisconsin State Journal that he had been responding to a call to assist the assistant principal at West High School in escorting a disruptive student.\n\nThe student - identified as being black - reportedly shoved the administrator's hand and started shouting obscenities at Anderson that included the n-word.\n\nAs Anderson told the student not to call him that, he claims the assistant principal turned on the mic on a radio and moved it so that other staff radios could hear what he was saying.\n\nAnderson shares he felt 'targeted' as a result.\n\nThe security guard said that he has been called the slur by students from both East and West High School 'many times'. Those moments often end in 'restorative conversations' between him and the students.\n\nWest High Principal Karen Boran sent an email to parents on Wednesday to inform them of the 'serious incident' that involved 'a staff member using a racial slur with students'.\n\n'As you know, our expectation when it comes to racial slurs has been very clear,' Boran said. 'Regardless of context or circumstance, racial slurs are not acceptable in our schools.'\n\nBoran added that the zero-tolerance approach 'has been applied consistently and will continue to be applied consistently.'\n\n'I also want to ask for your partnership as we work to make our school climate the very best it can be for all of our students and our staff,' she added.\n\nSuperintendent Jane Belmore reiterated the sentiment, adding that there 'has been shared several times through communication and professional development.'\n\nHe was assisting an incident at West High School when a student - identified as black - started using the slur against him\n\nAnderson shared that he felt 'targeted' by the assistant principal at the school who held a radio near the guard as he and the student talked\n\nIn the last school year, there were at least seven cases where employees were either fired or resigned for using the slur.\n\nAnderson is appealing the termination and has the backing of his community, who feel the policy is 'lazy'.\n\n'MMSD needs to modify this lazy, harmful and whole-punched policy that allows it to avoid doing the real work that any HR department should do by looking at the context in which such a word (or any other) is used,' explained Kaleem Caire, former CEO of the Urban League of Greater Madison.\n\n'They are an academic institution and should be educating themselves and young people about the use of words like N****r, not running from it.\n\nShe later added: 'Marlon should get his job back plus back-pay. Sometimes leaders have to admit they made a mistake rather than hide behind the mistakes they've made. It feels like that is what MMSD is doing here\n\n'They committed to a flawed policy that was reactionary and not well thought through.'", "description": "Marlon Anderson announced Monday on Facebook that he would be allowed back at\u00a0West High School in Madison, Wisconsin soon after his firing was rescinded by the district.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com", "Matthew Wright For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/15/20039782-0-image-a-2_1571755034147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
