In this continuing (ugh, forever) era of the antihero, we\u2019re practically guaranteed death and misery as the caps to any and all high-end TV. And yet here we are, with Unbelievable ending on not only a judicial victory but a personal one for nearly all parties involved and a joy-affirming phone call between a young rape victim and the detective who tirelessly pursued her rapist. Unbelievable did a lot of things well, but one place it uniquely succeeded was in treating earnestness earnestly and never losing its audience\u2019s respect along the way.\n\nIts helps, of course, that this series was based on a true story, and that some ounce of justice was served for the real Marie, Amber, Sarah, Doris, and Lilly. But what kept Unbelievable from disappearing into cheese were the honest, ungilded performances by the show\u2019s bigger stars, like Kaitlyn Dever, Merritt Wever, and Toni Collette, along with its supporting actors, especially Danielle Macdonald (Amber), Annaleigh Ashford (Lilly), and Eric Lange (Detective Parker).\n\nParker isn\u2019t a villain (who really needs another one with Christopher McCarthy hanging around?). Instead, he\u2019s a representation of how we all \u2014 well, most of us \u2014 think of ourselves: competent, smart, resourceful, and committed to upholding the social contract. Which is why, when she calls to fill him in on the updates to Marie\u2019s file, he doesn\u2019t hesitate to tell Rasmussen why he closed the case. \u201cThe law\u2019s the law,\u201d he says with an \u201coh shucks\u201d twang, and then \u201cwe had to charge her\u201d with false reporting, a statement we know to be incorrect since Marie\u2019s lawyer pointed out that the charge was \u201cbizarre\u201d and practically unheard of. Parker thinks he\u2019s helping the trains run on time, when, in reality, he pulled the emergency brake and caused a pileup.\n\nThe moment when the photo comes through and slowly morphs from a puzzle of pixels to a clear shot of Marie\u2019s ID on her abdomen, Parker looks as if he doesn\u2019t know whether to vomit, cry, or just put his face down on his desk. He hasn\u2019t just made a mistake; he has committed the gravest error a police officer can make: He turned the victim into the offender. To give credit where it\u2019s due, he does seek to make amends by coming out to Colorado to sort through the paperwork. He\u2019s immediately chastened, telling Rasmussen, \u201cYou hear about bad cops \u2026 I always think, Who the hell let them on the force?,\u201d then points out that maybe he isn\u2019t worthy of his position. In a brilliant, moving scene, he goes to Marie himself, offers up his atonement, and at least repays the fine she was charged by the city.\n\nBut Marie isn\u2019t settling. Throughout seven episodes, she has quietly accepted vilification and condescension and neglect. In turn, she has become more husk than human, looking dazed as she gazes over the heads of the kids at the go-kart track. \u201cI try to be positive,\u201d she cried to Parker and Pruitt in the interrogation room when they brought up her abusive childhood. That spark is gone, but Parker\u2019s visit and the measly $500 check light a fire underneath her.\n\n\u201cWho do you want to sue?,\u201d Marie\u2019s former defender asks. \u201cPretty much everybody,\u201d she replies, \u201cbut I thought I\u2019d start with the city.\u201d And the crowd goes wild. The $150,000 she\u2019s eventually offered and takes isn\u2019t the massive sum her fancy-pants lawyer expects her to hold out for. It\u2019s a good bit of money, of course, but it won\u2019t let Marie live a life of leisure \u2014 it isn\u2019t the piles of millions that Americans are known to sue for after they\u2019ve spilled coffee. But Marie doesn\u2019t want to make a statement or squeeze the government for every nickel she can wrangle. Her want is the most basic of all \u2014 acknowledgement of what its blind ignorance caused her, and the ability to get her feet back underneath her.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s other victims get their own forms of justice too. For Amber, that that\u2019s just observing his sentencing hearing without anyone forcing her to testify or confront him. For Sarah, it\u2019s the right to stay home, to avoid McCarthy, but not have her silence mistaken for a lack of care. For Doris, it\u2019s the ability to ask him face-to-face why he chose her, what she did to attract his attention, even if he remains stone-faced and silent. (\u201cIt\u2019s made my world very small\u201d is simultaneously the saddest and most apt of all the women\u2019s statements.) For Lilly, the most fiery of the group, it\u2019s a public reckoning with how wildly that one night has altered the way she moves through the world. She\u2019s scared all the time, she explains, and no friend or security camera can change that.\n\nNo testimony can change that either. Undoubtedly, the real women attacked by Marc O\u2019Leary in Colorado and Washington in 2008 and 2011 haven\u2019t simply ambled away from the experience lighthearted because it ended so decidedly on the side of justice. But 327 and a half years in prison isn\u2019t a sentence; it\u2019s a statement, a scare tactic, a piece of judicial badassery designed to drive home the point that there are judges who see rape as the violation of human life that it is, who see men like O\u2019Leary as predators. McCarthy himself makes a rather stunning point when Taggert questions him: \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to stop,\u201d he explains. Prevention is surely the best procedure. Taking women like Marie seriously and following up on any and all leads is second-best. But 327 years in jail isn\u2019t a bad third place.\n\nWomen don\u2019t walk around this country feeling safe. We hold our keys between our fingers on dark streets and wonder if we\u2019ll have to use them to wield off attackers. We keep our drinks pressed tight to our bodies at parties and bars. We fake phone calls to keep strange men at bay. We take longer routes home to walk under streetlights. We text friends from bus stops and after we\u2019ve locked our front doors. We turn on location-sharing lest a date turn ugly or violent. We reconsider running shorts when it\u2019s blazing hot just to keep the catcallers silent. We do a goddamn ton of the work to keep men from touching us in the ways we don\u2019t want to be touched. Frankly, it\u2019s exhausting. And if you\u2019ve been a victim of sexual assault or rape, the fear and the coping can take over your life. So it\u2019s all the more refreshing to see a young woman have even some of that yoke lifted off her. None of us will walk any easier having seen Unbelievable, but we know what standard we\u2019re searching for when it comes to police work. We know what level of care a victim of rape is due. We know what\u2019s possible.\n\nAt the very end of this series, Marie has her picture taken on her own terms, this time at the DMV. She gets to say her piece to Parker. She gets that apology. But most movingly, she takes herself to the beach and reclaims it. During her rape, as she lay on her bed blindfolded, she replayed a happy scene in her mind: running in the surf with friends, laughing, free from any encumbrance for possibly one of the only moments of her young life. When she calls Duvall, she\u2019s back on the beach, the weight lifted. And the two women, who have never met and never shared this screen, are revealed as kindred spirits. Both women want to see the good in the world. \u201cI wake up now and I can imagine good things happening,\u201d Marie says. And she lives happier ever after.", "description": "The series ends on not only a judicial victory but a personal one for nearly all parties involved.
