HUD spokespeople offered conflicting accounts of what Carson knew about the order, and he appeared to blame the fiasco on his wife, Candy, in congressional testimony.\n\nBut the IG said, \u201cWe found no evidence indicating that either Secretary or Mrs. Carson exerted improper influence on any departmental employee in connection with the procurement.\u201d\n\nThe order \u201cinitially went forward because career officials \u2026 determined that the existing dining room furniture set in the secretarial suite was in poor condition, that it could not be repaired, and that it should be replaced,\u201d the IG found.\n\nCarson said he was \u201cso disgusted\u201d with the \u201cnarrative\u201d surrounding the order, in an interview earlier Thursday with Fox Business.\n\nMorning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.
