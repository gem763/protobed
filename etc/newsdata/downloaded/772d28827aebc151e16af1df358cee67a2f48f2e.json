Uber is down 18% from its May 10 debut. Slack is down about 28% since its June 20 direct listing. Gig economy platform Fiverr has sunk 47% since its June 13 IPO. Secondhand clothing site The Real Real, which soared 40% on its June 28 IPO date, is down 42% since.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, WeWork parent The We Company confirmed reports that it will hold off on its planned IPO, but still aims to go public before the end of 2019.
