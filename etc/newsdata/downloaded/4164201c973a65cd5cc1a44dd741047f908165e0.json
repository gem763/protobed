That forecast is almost certain to be revised downward next month.Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki vowed to exhaust as much government spending for this year as possible during an audit at the National Assembly.Analysts said that the economy lacks momentum to deliver much growth in the ongoing final quarter.\u201cIt would be challenging to achieve the 2 percent annual growth due to factors like lack of fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Lee Young-hwa, an economist at Kyobo Securities.\u201cThe major driver behind the stronger-than-expected growth in the second quarter - at 1 percent on quarter - was huge government expenditure and a base effect,\u201d Lee said, \u201cBut as the government has already executed 77.4 percent of its budget, the government\u2019s role would be limited.\u201dKorea slipped below the 2 percent range for growth only four times in its modern history: 0.7 percent in 1956 as a result of a bad harvest, minus 1.7 percent in 1980 in the aftermath of the global oil crisis, minus 5.5 percent in 1998 following the Asian financial crisis and 0.8 percent in 2009 in the wake of the global economic meltdown.The central bank and think tanks attributed the downbeat results to soft domestic consumption and weak investment especially in construction.\u201cThe moderation in quarter-on-quarter growth in the third quarter reflected a significant slowdown in consumption expenditure, which rose by only 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter, compared to rapid growth of 1.1 percent in the second quarter,\u201d said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit in a statement.Construction investment slumped 5.2 percent compared to the previous quarter and plunged 3 percent compared to the same quarter last year.Exports, however, showed signs of improvement as they jumped 4.1 percent on quarter, helped by the semiconductor and automobile sectors.BY PARK EUN-JEE [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/24220541.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
