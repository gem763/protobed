The right-wing threat is not.", "language": "en", "text": "There is a rising trend that goes something like this, as per New York University\u2019s Jonathan Haidt: A left-wing professor says something provocative on social media or elsewhere and the right-wing media goes into overdrive, covering the story ad nauseum to gin up viewer outrage. Republican politicos jump in and demand action. University administrators, terrified of the PR damage but unworried about academic freedom, put the professor on leave and begin the \u201cprocess of termination,\u201d especially if the professor isn\u2019t tenured. (Haidt, incidentally, is no liberal pleader. In fact, he is a celebrity in conservative circles because he founded the highly respected Heterodox Academy with the sole purpose of addressing the lack of intellectual diversity on liberal-dominated campuses.)\n\nIn just the last six months, Acadia University\u2019s Sachs has documented several incidents in Iowa, California, and Connecticut that fit exactly this pattern.\n\nIn another incident just last month, the University of Alabama fired Jamie R. Riley, its black assistant vice president and dean of students after Breitbart exposed past tweets in which he criticized the American flag and made a connection between police and racism. Meanwhile, the chief of staff of Congressman Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.) personally called and threatened University of Nebraska Professor Ari Kohen for \u201cliking\u201d a Facebook post depicting a defaced campaign sign of the congressman showing googly eyes and calling him Fartenberry. The staffer accused Kohen of encouraging \u201cvandalism,\u201d arguably an attempt at chilling speech.", "description": "", "authors": ["Shikha Dalmia", "Theweek.Com Articles Leftwing-Threat-Campus-Free-Speech-Abating-Rightwing-Threat-Not"], "top_image": ""}
