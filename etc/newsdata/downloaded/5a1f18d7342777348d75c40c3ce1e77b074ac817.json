They are seeking an unprecedented third successive title and have not lost a World Cup match since France shocked them in the quarter-finals 12 years ago.\n\nThe numbers hardly look any better for England when they assess their own record against New Zealand - seven wins from 41 games and only one victory, in 2012, in the last 16.\n\nBut they go into Saturday\u2019s titanic clash full of confidence and truly believing they have the depth and variety to unseat the favourites and reach the final for the first time since losing to South Africa in 2007.\n\nOddly, much of that belief comes from one of those interminable defeats - the last one almost a year ago at Twickenham.\n\nEngland ripped out to a 15-0 lead playing exhilarating rugby, only for the All Blacks to fight back, as they so often do, to lead 16-15.\n\nEngland thought they had won it with a last-gasp try by Sam Underhill and, though it was ruled out for a marginal offside to give the visitors victory, everyone playing in the game and the fans knew they were watching an England team who had the tools to prevail should they meet again on the sport\u2019s biggest stage.\n\n\u201cWe were confident enough to think we\u2019d make the semi-finals which is why, for two-and-a-half years, we have been building up a game to play New Zealand,\u201d Jones said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain sort of game you have to have to play against them and certainly we\u2019ve tried to incorporate that into our tactical armoury. We don\u2019t have to bring a lot of new stuff this week.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand came into the tournament with people sensing a chink of light after blips against South Africa and Australia but that looked like wishful thinking when they overwhelmed the Springboks in their first pool game and destroyed Ireland in the quarter-finals with a superb all-round display.\n\nBoth teams are packed with huge forward power, tackle with frightening intensity and have explosive and deadly backs, brilliantly adept at seizing on loose ball.\n\nNew Zealand will again use Beauden Barrett at fullback and Richie Mo\u2019unga at flyhalf as dual playmakers, with England doing the same via the recalled George Ford at flyhalf and captain Owen Farrell shifted to inside centre.\n\nIf it is as tight as many are suggesting, goalkicking will be key. Farrell landed eight from eight in the quarter-final win over Australia and thrives on the big occasion. Similarly, Mo\u2019unga is also known as a man with ice in his veins.\n\n\u201cEngland have been a marvellous team in periods and we have a lot of respect for what they have achieved over the last four years,\u201d All Black coach Steve Hansen said. \u201cIt will be a big battle.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones' reign as England head coach has been building up to this moment - proving they can beat the best at the World Cup", "authors": ["Alex Smith"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20726600.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ireland-v-Scotland-Rugby-World-Cup-2019-Group-A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
