Like some suckers still do, I once believed that \u201cscience\u201d was a rigorous process where you tested theories and revised those theories in response to objective evidence. But in today\u2019s shabby practice, \u201cscience\u201d is just a package of self-serving lies buttressing the transnational liberal elite\u2019s preferred narrative. Our alleged betters hope that labeling their propaganda \u201cscience\u201d will science-shame you into silence about what everyone knows is a scam.\n\nNah. \u201cClimate change\u201d is a hoax. Come arrest me for felony denial.\n\nUnderstand that the term \u201cclimate change\u201d does not refer to actual meteorological phenomena but, rather, to the sordid rat-king of lies, scams and power grabs that we are commanded to accept as pagan gospel lest we burn to a crisp or drown or suffer...whatever the Armageddon du jour is. When you say \u201cclimate change is a grift,\u201d and you should as often as possible, you are pointing out that this green-on-the-outside/red-on-the-inside fake frenzy is really just a set of intertwined grifts transparently designed to separate you from your freedom and your property in the name of somehow adjusting the weather.\n\nObserving that \u201cclimate change\u201d is steaming garbage served in a dirty ashtray is not disputing that the climate changes. That the climate is not static, and never could be static, is one of the myriad reasons that this whole idea is ridiculous. The planet gets hotter, it gets colder, sometimes quickly, sometimes over eons, and there are a bunch of reasons why, like the sun and volcanos. Human-produced carbon might be one of the factors, but there\u2019s simply no evidence that it is a significant one. Of course, if they really cared about carbon, they would be up in arms about China and India, which are upping their output while we are slashing ours. Yet the object of their ire is your New York strip. Gosh, does that seem consistent with 1) someone truly concerned about atmospheric carbon, or 2) someone who trembles with joy at the notion of bossing around you rubes out in gun/Jesusland?\n\nThe underlying premise of their claims seems to be that there is a \u201cright\u201d temperature for the earth; watch them sputter when you enquire about that perfect setting for Earth\u2019s thermostat. Remember, if you ask questions you hate \u201cscience.\u201d If they did stop telling you how you hate \u201cscience\u201d long enough to respond, they might explain that of course there\u2019s no perfect temperature \u2013 it\u2019s not like LA, where it\u2019s always 72 degrees.\n\nBut then, what are they comparing the present climate to in order to declare that our climate is \u201cgetting worse?\u201d If you establish a climate baseline, then you can compare what\u2019s actually happening to the baseline and that might demonstrate that the whole thing is baloney. That would be awkward. It happened after Katrina. Oh, Katrina\u2019s proof positive that Gaia is really ticked off and\u2026and\u2026and\u2026then we had a bunch of years without much hurricane action at all. You might think that this would be evidence that maybe the climate wasn\u2019t in chaos, and that they would be happy to be proven wrong, but no, it doesn\u2019t work that way. Every time the weather fits the narrative, you see, it\u2019s proof that the climate kooks are right, and every time the weather fails to fit the narrative, well, weather\u2019s not climate. At least until the next heat wave or storm; then weather will totally be climate again.\n\nHeads, you must give us all your freedom and money, and also tails, you must give us all your freedom and money.\n\nNow, we\u2019re being told that we\u2019re all going to die in\u2026I guess we\u2019re down to what? About 11.5 years this go \u2018round? Of course, we\u2019ve been told many times that we\u2019re doomed and the deadlines have come and gone with the doomsdayers not missing a beat. They\u2019re like old timey Elmer Gantrys promising the apocalypse over and over again, with their hardcore true believers regularly showing up for the rapture over and over again no matter how many times the Four Horseman fail to turn up.\n\nWe haven\u2019t even seen one horseman.\n\nBack in the 70s, I remember we were promised an ice age if we didn\u2019t give liberals our money and freedom. Then in the 80s, we were promised death by ozone hole if we didn\u2019t give liberals our money and freedom, and then doom by acid rain if we didn\u2019t give liberals our money and freedom. By the time they started promising that we were all gonna die from global warming if we didn\u2019t give liberals our money and freedom, I was still wanting my ice age. It would be nice to have a white Christmas in LA.\n\nSo, where\u2019s my damn ice age?\n\nOh right, only a climate denier \u2013 Climate, I deny thee! \u2013 might wonder why we should hand over one, ten, a hundred trillion bucks to people who have never once been right about their predictions. You evidently hate \u201cscience\u201d if you expect the \u201cscience\u201d people to be correct at least one time in a half-century.\n\nAnd they\u2019re not even good at short-term prognostication. Heck, for several days Hurricane Dorian was supposed to slam head on into Florida and then\u2026it didn\u2019t. The Obamas just bought a $15 million pad on the beach \u2013 what\u2019s that say about their faith in \u201cscience?\u201d But don\u2019t worry, the guys batting .000 so far will definitely get the temperature in 2119 right if we only just write them a huge check and transform ourselves from citizens to serfs.\n\nThat\u2019s another big red flag \u2013 have you noticed how \u201cscience\u201d always tells us that the only possible response to the climate hullabaloo is to give liberals exactly what they always wanted anyway? How lucky are the leftists to have had an existential problem drop in their laps where the only solution is to give them everything they could not otherwise convince us to give them? What a remarkable coincidence!\n\nAnd what\u2019s also weird is how nothing that we must do right now no time to debate it\u2019s a crisis think o\u2019 the children in any way inconveniences or calls for sacrifices from our climate crisis-pushing elite. Boy, they really scored with climate change \u2013 if they were going to manufacture a crisis in order to get the power and money they craved, how would they do it any differently?\n\nNow, they might claim that they too will have to sacrifice to the Angry Weather Demon, but it\u2019s unclear how. I suppose they might stop flying across the globe to climate finger-wagging festivals in private jets, but call me jaded for thinking that if it\u2019s such a crisis today and they have not stopped doing it yet, they won\u2019t stop jetting about down the road. Oh, but you will. You most definitely will stop flying and driving the vehicles you choose and eating cheeseburgers and using straws that don\u2019t disintegrate into gummy sludge in your Dr. Pepper. But them? Pete Buttigieg explained away his zipping around in Gulfstreams as necessary because it is important for him to be pestering people in Des Moines. Bet you that pretty much everything our betters want to do will turn out to be \u201cimportant.\u201d And I\u2019ll bet that nothing what you peasants want to do will.\n\nOne might think that if stopping carbon was important, you might want to explore nuclear power. But you would think wrong. After all, if there\u2019s plenty of electrical power, the elite loses the political power that comes from divvying up a scarce resource. If they control the power, they control you. Cheap, plentiful power makes you freer, which is a bug, not a feature.\n\nOh, and those many millions of people in Middle America who directly or indirectly rely on fracking and the rest of the fossil fuel industry? Even bloody-eyed, Gaffe-atronic Joe 3000 wants to shaft you. Better learn to code or something, because your good job is history. Weird how all the sacrifice once again falls on those out in the hinterlands and not on the blue coastal city swells, huh? But you\u2019ll be able to rest easy knowing that our moral superiors in Brooklyn and Alexandria and Santa Monica enjoyed showing you sweaty rubes who\u2019s really the boss by impoverishing you. Because that, and not the weather in a century, is and always has been what the \u201cclimate change\u201d hoax is really all about.\n\nIf you want to read a vivid account of what happens if the Democrats succeed and manage to enslave us through weather inquisitions or disarming those of us who don\u2019t commit crimes or however, check out my action-packed yet hilarious novels, People's Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire.
