Instead, the report said there was no collusion.\n\nAt the same time, we learned that it was the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democrats who sought Russian and Ukrainian assistance in trying to dig up dirt on candidate Trump and his associates.\n\nThe American people are astute and their eyes are wide open.\n\nThey know that what the Democrats are now attempting with their latest impeachment charade involving a Trump phone call with the new leader of Ukraine is just their latest political stunt \u2013 and this one reeks of desperation.\n\nThe Democrats are desperate to obfuscate what\u2019s coming on the horizon. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s report on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse is coming; U.S. Attorney John Durham\u2019s findings on the origins of the Russia hoax are coming; and Attorney General William Barr is working to get to the truth that has been obscured by Democrats and the anti-Trump media for so long.\n\nThe circus created by the Washington swamp in the wake of President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is showcasing \u2013 once again \u2013 the obvious double standard that is afforded the liberal left by the biased mainstream media. But after the sad ordeal we\u2019ve witnessed over the past three years, the American people have caught on.\n\nAs Democrats allege a quid pro quo by President Trump that a transcript shows actually didn\u2019t happen, the media are ignoring the quid pro quo involving former Vice President Joe Biden that did happen \u2013 in plain view.\n\nAs House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., attempts to move the goalposts in the absence of a quid pro quo with unserious theories about the so-called \u201csequencing\u201d of events, the corruption involving Joe Biden is on video on the Internet for all to see.\n\nIn January 2018, while appearing at a public forum, Biden the braggart career politician admitted to an actual quid pro quo involving a $1 billion U.S. loan guarantee for Ukraine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn his own words Biden \u2013 then serving as vice president \u2013 said he told Ukrainian officials: \u2018\u201cI\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars.\u2019 I said \u2018you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.\u2019 I looked at them and said: \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the problem for Biden. The Ukrainian prosecutor the vice president succeeded in getting fired was at the same time investigating a natural gas company called Burisma, where Biden\u2019s son Hunter was a highly paid board member.\n\nDespite all this, the Democrats and the liberal media are attempting the \u201cnothing to see here\u201d routine \u2013 but the American people aren\u2019t buying it. They see a Trump-Zelensky phone call transcript with no quid pro quo and a Biden video with a quid pro quo.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe logical question is: Where is the investigation of Joe Biden and why aren\u2019t the so-called truth-seeking media demanding it?\n\nAt the end of the day, the Democrats in charge of the U.S. House of Representatives are running a political smear campaign against the duly elected president of the United States and trying to convince the American people that it\u2019s a legitimate impeachment inquiry. This won\u2019t work.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAVID BOSSIE", "description": "In the past three years we\u2019ve seen widespread misconduct by opponents of candidate and later President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["David Bossie", "David N.
