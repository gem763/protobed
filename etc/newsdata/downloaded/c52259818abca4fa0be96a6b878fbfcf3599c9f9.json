Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y.\n\nCity Council member Fernando Cabrera said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a \u201cno show\u201d in the district.\n\n\u201cOnly a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it\u2019s going to be a moderate Democrat,\u201d Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. \u201cShe\u2019s a no-show in the district. She hasn\u2019t brought about anything except division within the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocialism doesn\u2019t work,\" Cabrera added. \"I don\u2019t want it for my children, for my grandchildren.\"\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AND WARREN GAIN GROUND IN DEMOCRATIC RACE\n\nHe said he decided to run after becoming fed up with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s railing against Amazon\u2019s plans to build a headquarters in Queens-- plans Amazon pulled out because of backlash from New York City lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIt was staggering to me,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cWe have somebody who literally dismantled the possibility of us having 25,000 jobs, and she has yet to bring any jobs into the district.\u201d\n\nLIZ CHENEY, OTHERS IN GOP SPEARHEAD BID TO SANCTION TURKEY FOR SYRIA INVASION\n\nCabrera could face attacks over his past views on gay rights. According to Politico, a video surfaced in 2014 of Cabrera praising Uganda\u2019s restrictive anti-gay laws. In response, Cabrera, who is also a pastor, pointed out that he has voted in favor of every piece of legislation supported by the LGBT caucus while on New York's city council.\n\nCabrera was first elected to the city council in 2009, and he lives about a mile outside of the district which he is running to represent. Cabrera told City and State NY \u201cI\u2019ve done more for the Bronx and Queens than [Ocasio-Cortez] ever has.\u201d Cabrera was a registered Republican until 2008.\n\nA number of Republicans have entered the race to challenge Ocasio-Cortez, but Cabrera is the first well-known Democrat to do so.\n\nCabrera's complaints about Ocasio-Cortez echo those of Republican Scherie Murray, a businesswoman who emigrated from Jamaica and entered the race against Ocasio-Cortez in July.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"There is a crisis in Queens, and it\u2019s called AOC,\u201d Murray told Fox News at the time. \u201cAnd instead of focusing on us, she\u2019s focusing on being famous. Mainly rolling back progress and authoring the job-killing Green New Deal and killing the Amazon New York deal.\u201d\n\nFour other Republicans have filed to run for the seat as well-- former police officer John Cummings, medical journalist Ruth Papazian, construction contractor Miguel Hernandez and entrepreneur Antoine Tucker.", "description": "A prominent New York City Democrat filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Thursday to launch a primary challenge for the House of Representatives\u00a0seat currently held by Rep.
