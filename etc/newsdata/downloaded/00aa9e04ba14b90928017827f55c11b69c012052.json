It demonstrates the vapidity of how Kamala Harris talks about serious issues and consistently has throughout the campaign. Many of you may remember when I eviscerated her for talking about climate change by advocating for a plastic straw ban.\n\nIt\u2019s the same type of cosmetic solution meant to appeal to the boomer class. Other candidates on the stage were talking about the structural impact that big tech has in our daily lives and how we want our economy to be structured.

This text makes me think you are totally, totally unready for an actual presidential campaign.\" Looks like that staffer won't have to worry, because given her slump to below 5% in the Real Clear Politics polling average, they don't have very much to worry about.\n\nI know I'm giving her a hard time, but I think Kamala Harris is the product of a bankrupt political system, bankrupt ideology, that is bipartisan in nature. Harris picks cheap fights on cosmetic issues to satisfy the loudest, richest voices around her but doesn't actually have the courage to fight against the interests of the powerful who perpetuate a system that isn't working for the majority of Americans.", "description": "Opinion by: Saagar EnjetiA day or so has passed, so the full emptiness of Kamala Harris's appearance on the debate stage has finally settled in my mind.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/harriskamala_09122019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
