They\u2019re not listening to us. That\u2019s the whole point. That\u2019s the whole question. The government, they do not understand us,\" explains one farmer.\n\nThe thousands of farmers gathering here say government measures to meet their climate change targets are unfairly hitting them and not other industries like aerospace - the nearby Schipol airport up for a massive expansion.\n\nThis convoy of tractors is now heading to The Hague to the Dutch government. They\u2019re calling on the government to change its policy and to ease the burden on farmers.\n\nThe 70-kilometre journey takes more than three hours for the tractors.\n\nAnd while they\u2019re blocking traffic, the route is lined with members of the general public supporting their action.\n\n\u201cThey really have a goal and a meaning. They work so hard for our food and I think it\u2019s good to unity and make a protest,\" says one resident of Utrecht.\n\nA government spokesperson told Euronews that farmers have the right to protest, that they understand their worries and frustration that they want to start a dialogue as soon as possible and have frequently offered that.\n\nAgricultural exports from out of the Netherlands bring over \u20ac92 billion into the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThese farmers insist they\u2019ll keep clogging up the roads until the government changes its position.", "description": "The thousands of farmers gathering here say government measures to meet their climate change targets are unfairly hitting them.
