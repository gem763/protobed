It looks more like traders doing some short-term flips rather than accumulation by big funds looking to build positions. Trust levels are low, which isn't a big surprise given the damage that has been done to many individual stocks.\n\nBreadth is running about 4,100 gainers to 2,800 decliners but there are more stocks making new 12-month lows than highs. There is no upside leadership in this market at present, although a few defensive groups such as pharmaceuticals are seeing some interest.\n\nOver the weekend I start looking through the trash pile in initial public offerings (IPOs) and biotechnology to start formulating some watch lists. There are a few things of interest, but no rush to jump in fast.\n\nOne example on my shopping list is Personalis Inc. (PSNL) , a cancer genomics company that is my Stock of the Week. It is seeing some support here on Monday morning, but like many other names there isn't any immediate news catalysts. As we head into earning season more entry points should develop, but for now if you want in it is best to do so very slowly.\n\nIt is the end of the quarter and that is going to cause some movement as funds continue to reposition, but it does create inefficient pricing and that is good news.\n\nI'm not feeling very optimistic about the market right here, and if the S&P 500 takes out its opening low I expect to see the bears make another push.\n\nI'm playing very strong defense with a few minor nibbles of stocks that I think may have some promise into earnings season. There should be some very interesting opportunities as this action plays out this week.", "description": "With trust levels low in this stock market, it is best to tread slowly as there is no upside leadership at present....PSNL", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "With Trust Levels Low", "It'S Best To Tread Slowly", "There Is No Upside Leadership At Present", "Although A Few Defensive Groups Such As Pharmaceuticals Are Seeing Some Interest.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Bob Lang", "Bob Ciura"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/9cfeca50-ccd3-11e9-848d-5d8ab4a76127.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
