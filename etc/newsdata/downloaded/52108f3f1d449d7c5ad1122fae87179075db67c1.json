Nobody else can dictate my choices,\u201d Kareena Kapoor Khan told a portal in a recent interview. This statement probably best describes the diva who has entertained fans for the past 19 years through a variety of characters on celluloid.From playing a sex worker to a villain, there is probably little that the actor, who kick-started her Bollywood journey with JP Dutta\u2019s Refugee alongside Abhishek Bachchan, has not experimented with.What sets her apart from her contemporaries is the fact that despite the high and lows through her career, Kapoor has not only managed to stay relevant, but is far from the rat race. \u201cAs a person, I am very comfortable in my space. I have always been content with the choices I made in my career as well as my personal life. I was never aspiring to be someone. I was always working and will keep working towards being the better version of me. I don\u2019t measure my life by what other people think,\u201d she told the same website.There is no denying that the film business is competitive, and often defines an actor by her physical appearance wherein age lines and excess weight are reasons of worry. Shattering these notions, the 39-year-old proved to be a breath of fresh air when she carried her pregnancy with much elan, and enjoyed it to the fullest. Talking about the phase, she had told Filmfare, \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of models and actors in our country and in the west have done this as well. But probably, there hasn\u2019t been a commercial actress, who\u2019s not taken a sabbatical or remained behind closed doors. But pregnancy is the most normal thing. I was excited about starting a family and having a child. I was looking forward it to and I wanted to share my joy with my family, friends and fans. So there was nothing to hide. Even the fact that I had gained some weight. Actually, I put on most of my weight during my last trimester. It was also something that I wanted to enjoy. Every woman puts on weight and enjoys that period in her life.\u201dShe delivered her bundle of joy, Taimur Ali Khan, on December 20, 2016, and soon after, began working out to get back in shape and prep for her next film, Veere Di Wedding. In an interview to a portal, she admitted that it was her husband Saif Ali Khan, who encouraged her to get back to work. \u201cIt was Saif who told me to hit the gym, get to the studio and get back to work. He told me take Taimur along and set an example for all young, working mothers that they can do it too,\u201d she said. The actor has also been vocal about she and Khan share every responsibility as far as their son is concerned.Besides acting, Kapoor has also dabbled in radio, and is currently occupied with the second season of her chat show, which highlights issues that women face in the present times. She was also seen as a judge of a children\u2019s reality show. In the coming months, the actor will feature in Good News starring Akshay Kumar and Hindi Medium 2 featuring Imran Khan. With over 50 films under her belt, the star doesn\u2019t plan to slow down. \u201cI hope my career never gets over, and I continue to act till I am 80. Acting is my passion, acting has no bar, it\u2019s a limitless field. I want to continue acting and at the same time I want to be a happy woman.\u201d Well, that\u2019s Bebo for us!", "description": "She has seen dizzying heights of success, and has handled lows with utmost grace.
