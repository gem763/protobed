Todd Phillips\u2019 revisionist origin story is different from those other entries in the bad-guy sub-genre, though. Devoid of fist fights and bank robberies, Batcaves and Batmobiles, Joker is a dark, dingy drama about urban decay, alienation, and anti-capitalist protests, with a distinctive retro vision and a riveting central performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Whether these differences make it much better than other supervillain movies, however, is open to question.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Four stars for The Truth\n\n- Brad Pitt stars in Ad Astra\n\n- Ten films to watch in September\n\nThe film doesn\u2019t specify when it is set, but its Gotham City is modelled on the graffiti-sprayed, litter-strewn pre-gentrification New York of Taxi Driver and Midnight Cowboy. This is the home of Arthur Fleck, played by Phoenix as a greasy, disturbingly emaciated figure with ribs and vertebrae poking out at all angles. No male actor has been this skinny since Christian Bale \u2013 yes, Batman himself \u2013 starved himself to stick-insect proportions for The Machinist.\n\nJoker is ultimately nothing but a flimsy, two-hour supervillain origin movie\n\nArthur scrapes a living as a party clown, and shares a crummy flat with his aged mother Penny (Frances Conroy), one of the film\u2019s many resemblances to Phoenix\u2019s last outing as a damaged killer, You Were Never Really Here. Years earlier, Penny worked for Gotham\u2019s richest industrialist, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) \u2013 the father, of course, of a certain Bruce Wayne \u2013 so she hopes that if she writes begging letters to her old boss, he might just swoop down and save her. Arthur, meanwhile, hopes that he might get a date with the attractive single mother (Zazie Beetz) who lives down the dreary hallway. He also hopes that he might make it as a stand-up comic, perhaps even appearing on a talk show hosted by Robert De Niro\u2019s Murray Franklin. But as Arthur has an array of mental illnesses that require him to take seven kinds of medication, the chances of these hopes being fulfilled are almost as thin as he is.\n\nThe film traces his gradual uncovering of family secrets, and his slow descent into homicidal mania \u2013 and I do mean slow. Joker doesn\u2019t have much of a plot, let alone any subplots, so there are only a couple of major sequences that haven\u2019t already been in the trailers. Phoenix is a magnificent presence \u2013 always believable, how outrageous he becomes \u2013 and I was quite happy to sit and watch him skipping around in his outsized shoes and striking balletic poses on beautifully grimy staircases. But, however unusual its grungy 70s styling may be, Joker is ultimately nothing but a flimsy, two-hour supervillain origin movie, so the viewer is just waiting for Arthur to become the fully-fledged Clown Prince of Crime. If it had been chopped down to an hour and then intercut with a Batman plot, what a film that might have been.\n\nBatman could polish off this poor sap without crumpling his cape\n\nThe screenplay, by Phillips and Scott Silver, does make several witty additions to Joker lore. One of these is that Arthur has a medical condition related to Tourette\u2019s syndrome, which forces him to dissolve into fits of cackles at the most inconvenient moments. Phoenix makes these fits both blood-chilling and heartbreaking. The script also repositions the Joker as an anti-hero (or super-anti-hero), an accidental vigilante who guns down three Wall Street brats in self-defence, thus inspiring Gotham\u2019s underclass to put on clown masks and protest against the city\u2019s fat cats \u2013 including the interestingly thuggish and unsympathetic Thomas Wayne. Well, OK. Phillips and Silver are entitled to imagine any version of the Joker they like. But their film is way too superficial to take seriously as a study of class conflict and mental illness. And, compared to the sadistic mastermind who has been in the comics and on screen, its protagonist is strangely passive and unthreatening. Batman could polish off this poor sap without crumpling his cape.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Joker is superior to the aforementioned Suicide Squad and Venom. Its flawless recreation of an earlier decade is a remarkable feat of impersonation. And I would dearly love it if Phoenix revisited the character in a sequel. But the idea that Joker is significantly more mature and intelligent than previous superhero (or supervillain) films? You must be joking.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nLove film?
