He denied making the threat.\n\nIn her impact statement Miss Kendall said she had been \u2018physically and mentally tortured\u2019 by O\u2019Sullivan before he was jailed in February.\n\nAnd when he was released in June, he published a nasty rap song about her online, the court heard.\n\nWhen he was released on licence he started harassing his victim again, calling her up to 50 times a day (Picture: SWNS)\n\nMiss Parkes said O\u2019Sullivan \u2018fully admits\u2019 breaching the restraining order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018The meeting at Sainsbury\u2019s, he tells me, was a by-chance meeting.\n\n\u2018It was six miles from where she lived, and he was not aware she had used the store that afternoon.\n\n\u2018He saw her and apologised for what had happened. He accepts he should have walked away.\u2019\n\nBut she added: \u2018He has been doing well in custody. He knows now he can never have anything to do with this lady again.\u2019\n\nO\u2019Sullivan was jailed for a further 16 months after he pleaded guilty to breaching the order and stalking his victim.\n\nJudge Anthony Potter told him: \u2018It is for you to decide whether you want to do something to address this obsessive strain in your personality, otherwise you will be here again and again.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
