Heather Janssen, and Sylo Nozra and Goldchain. Scroll down to find out why you need to hear them, too.\n\nWhat new Canadian tunes are you currently obsessed with? Share them with us on Twitter @CBCMusic.\n\n'Time and Again,' Working Titles\n\nYou might recognize Glen Leck's name from such local Halifax outfits as the Legendary Golden River Show Band, Washing Machine and Kim Harris, but this August the musician released an EP under his solo moniker, Working Titles, that we've had on repeat. On opening track \"Time and Again,\" Leck's gruff, talk-sing bass twines perfectly with Melanie Stone's backup vocals, both gliding along to the gentle, timeless tug of that pedal steel (played by Asa Brosius, with Joel Waddell on drums, Noel Macdonald on guitar and Matthew Macdonald on synths). While \"Time and Again\" is our song pick this week, the full Shorelines EP is worth a listen \u2014 and its title, plus closing song \"Lake Swimmers,\" have us wishing we were doing so while floating in some body of water.\n\n\u2014 Holly Gordon\n\n'October,' Alessia Cara\n\nWhen Alessia Cara set off on tour with fellow Canadian pop star Shawn Mendes earlier this summer, she didn't intend to write any new music, but an entire EP came pouring out. \"October,\" her latest single from that upcoming EP titled This Summer, is the only song that addresses her life on the road, a sweet little melody about not wanting the experience of touring to end. \"I'm gonna miss it when it's over,\" she laments on the chorus. The relaxed, acoustic vibe of the track feels weightless, illustrating the joys and thrills of floating from city to city. Touring can of course be exhausting, but Cara encapsulates the bright side of her job, radiating an infectious energy that makes all those long trips and that day-to-day grind feel absolutely worth it in the end.\n\n\u2014 Melody Lau\n\n'U & I,' Sylo Nozra, Goldchain\n\nIn May, Sylo Nozra dropped \" FOMO ,\" a funky torch song that became one of our favourite tracks of the summer. And now, with his caps lock still on, he's back with \"U & I,\" another of his sterling collaborations with producer Goldchain. Meditating on a relationship that's \"on pause,\" Nozra wonders whether it was a \"one-time thing\" before revealing details about the hook-up in the infectious chorus: \"At Cinqo de Mayo/ swiped right on your bio/ you said 'C\u00f3mo est\u00e1s'/ we moved fast/ stars ignite,\" he sings \u2014 a scenario that provides Goldchain and Nozra tinder for their beautifully polished, slow-burning tropical-pop.\n\nHear Nozra and all your favourite R&B and soul musicians on CBC Music's Marvin's Room with Amanda Parris.\n\n\u2014 Robert Rowat\n\n'Who's Gonna Love U,' Ryan Shepherd feat. Heather Janssen\n\nIf you're into electronic music, Ryan Shepherd is a name you should get to know. In 2017, he teamed up with fellow Canadians Loud Luxury (of \"Body\" fame) on a mesmerizing remix of Craig David's song \"Fill Me In.\" Since then, Shepherd has been signed to Armin van Buuren's powerhouse dance music label, Armada, and has been touring both locally and internationally. His latest release, \"Who's Gonna Love U,\" will appeal not only to die-hard fans but also to the EDM-curious. After easing you in with soulful piano and Heather Janssen's passionate vocals, the song quickly introduces a throbbing bass that will get you moving. We're excited for Shepherd's three new tracks slated for release later this year.\n\n\u2014 Natasha Ramoutar", "description": "Four new tracks to add to your playlist right now.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5268922.1567541075!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ryan-shepherd.jpg"}
