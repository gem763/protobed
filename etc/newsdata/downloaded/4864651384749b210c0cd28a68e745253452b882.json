Most cricket fans of this century probably have no idea who he is.\n\nLuckily for those of us who grew up watching cricket in the 1990s, there is still something of a blur to remind us of a man who has been forgotten in the pages of Indian cricket history.\n\nWisden\n\nSadly, one cannot blame the average fan for forgetting him. For the man himself faded into oblivion and one has to go further back to realise just what an asset he was to Team India.\n\nSensational debut\n\n16 wickets in a Test is no mean feat, but to do it on your debut is something very special. Yes, the man grabbed 8 in each innings against West Indies in 1988 and helped India crush them by 255 runs. These are the best match figures on Test debut.\n\nMan of the series in Sharjah\n\nHirwani became the first Indian to take 4 wickets in 3 consecutive matches.\n\nYouTube\n\nDon't Miss 544 SHARES 835 SHARES 280 SHARES 4.8 K SHARES\n\nHit by bad form in West Indies\n\nWhen India toured West Indies in 1989, his bowling was attacked by the batsmen and even on tracks he could not do any damage\n\nLeft out of World Cup\n\nDip in form meant he did not find a place in the 1992 World Cup.\n\nReuters\n\nComeback in 1996\n\nHe had a good series against New Zealand and toured England as well before being out of favour once again.\n\nNo longer in consideration\n\nIn 2001 he was picked in the squad to play Australia but not the playing eleven. Slowly it led to him no longer being considered for matches. He took over 400 wickets for Madhya Pradesh in Ranji trophy and retired from first-class cricket at the end of the 2005\u201306 season. In 2014, he was appointed as the chairman of the Ranji Trophy Tournament Selection Committee of the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association.", "description": "Remember Narendra Hirwani?
