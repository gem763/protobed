The tanker was released on Aug. 18 after Iran pledged that the tanker\u2019s cargo wouldn\u2019t be delivered to Syria, which is under European Union sanctions due to the continuing civil war in the country.\n\nSatellite image provided by Maxar Technologies appears to show the Adrian Darya 1 off the coast of Tartus, Syria. Photo: /Associated Press\n\nWashington has issued a warrant seeking to confiscate the vessel and its cargo. The U.S. alleges the sale would benefit the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which Washington has designated a terrorist organization, and accuses the ship\u2019s managers of breaching a ban that prohibits the use of the American financial system for Iranian oil trades.\n\nSatellite images last showed the Adrian Darya 1 was just outside of the Syrian port of Tartus on Sunday. The photos don\u2019t show any oil transfer from the vessel to another tanker or a terminal, said Samir Madani, co-founder of shipping-tracker TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. officials have said the vessel\u2019s anchoring in Syrian waters would undermine the credibility of European attempts to de-escalate tensions between Iran and the West.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Sunday, Sigal Mandelker, the U.S. Treasury under secretary, said the vessels arrival in Syria showed Iran had engaged in \u201cyet another game of deception.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone who said the Adrian Darya 1 wasn\u2019t headed to Syria is in denial,\u201d U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said in a tweet late Friday. \u201cWe can talk, but Iran\u2019s not getting any sanctions relief until it stops lying.\u201d\n\nIn August, France proposed allowing Iran to sell at least 700,000 barrels of oil a day or granting Tehran a credit line of some $15 billion. In exchange, Iran\u2019s foreign minister Javad Zarif offered to improve compliance with an international nuclear deal.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal previously reported the tanker\u2019s cargo was set for Syria.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters in London that Washington has no current plan to seize the ship. But the U.S. has warned Egypt not to let the vessel pass through the Suez Canal, its most direct route of return to Iran, according to a U.S. official.\n\nEgypt has repeatedly stopped Iranian tankers from crossing the canal when papers weren\u2019t in order\u2014a potential issue for the Adrian Darya 1. Lloyd\u2019s Register, which normally issues safety certificates for the vessel, has stopped providing such services for the tanker, a spokeswoman for the London-based company said.\n\nThe Trump administration has also ratcheted up pressure on Iran\u2019s oil supplies to Syria, with a string of new sanctions on Sept 5.\n\nWrite to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com", "description": "A tanker released from Gibraltar despite U.S. objections that it was carrying crude to Syria has unloaded its oil, a top Iranian official said, after the ship dropped anchor near a Syrian port.", "authors": ["Benoit Faucon", "Nazih Osseiran", "Benoit.Faucon Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105194/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
