It\u2019s a wind-driven fire,\u201d Al Poirier, chief deputy of emergency operations for the LAFD, said at a press conference Thursday night. \u201cWe added a bunch of resources to it to try and get a hold of it, but obviously the weather and the fuels have allowed it to expand.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reports that winds in the area reached up to 60 miles per hour at the time the blaze broke out.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Death Toll in California Wildfire Climbs to 44 as Blaze Becomes Deadliest in State\u2019s History\n\n\u201cBecause of the wind-driven factor, it creates a more defensive posture for firefighters,\u201d Los Angeles firefighter John Ferrer told the outlet. \u201cWe wait until the wind dies down and can deploy adequate resources to contain the flanks of the fire and an early morning attack on the fire. But at this time we\u2019re in flux.\u201d\n\nAt least 10 schools were closed on Friday as multiple agencies tended to the blaze, NBC News reports.\n\nRELATED: Daring Rescues and Devastating Destruction: See the Most Shocking Photos of the California Fires\n\nThe Saddleridge fire comes nearly one year after the devastating Woolsey Fire, which broke out in Malibu on Nov. 8 and burned through 96,949 acres before it was contained on Nov. 22.\n\nThat blaze came the same time as the Camp Fire in Butte County, California, which went on to become the deadliest and most destructive fire in the state\u2019s history.\n\nAt least 88 people were killed and 18,000 structures destroyed in the Camp Fire flames, according to the Insurance Information Institute, citing Cal Fire statistics.", "description": "Saddleridge Fire Prompts Thousands of Evacuations in LA", "authors": ["Rachel Desantis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gmZbL1g6ZpjWDRptiO5SGg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/f9195e2f59655bf648875befcf30578a", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
