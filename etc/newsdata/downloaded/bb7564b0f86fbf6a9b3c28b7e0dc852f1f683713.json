This chapter stars Senator Harry Reid. When looking at the whole story, it\u2019s important to note that Senator Reid \u201c led passage of the $814 billion stimulus bill and worked to include the loan guarantee program to help finance clean-energy projects\u201d\u2014projects to which, as we will show, he is connected.\n\nIn a DOE press release , Reid actually bragged about how he included the green loan guarantee in the stimulus bill: \u201cAs I led passage of the stimulus bill, I worked to include the loan guarantee program to help finance clean energy projects\u201d that will \u201cbring us closer to energy independence.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve already unveiled two of these expensive and politically explosive projects through our Special Seven series\u2013\u2013those that received the touted loans as a part of the stimulus bill (even though they were rated as \u201cnon-investment\u201d grade) and grants, as well as \u201cspecial\u201d Department of Interior treatment. As the \u201cSpecial Seven\u201d moniker indicates, there are more companies and/or projects to reveal.\n\nBefore we start on the new information, here\u2019s a highlight of the previous players\u2019 specific connections to Senator Harry Reid\u2014the focus of this chapter.\n\nLast week, we exposed BrightSource Energy that received a $1.6 billion DOE loan. BrightSource\u2019s executives donated almost $4000 to Reid\u2019s 2010 campaign, including $2400 from the CEO John Woolard, who in September 2010, along with Peter Darbee, then Chairman of PG & E, hosted a fundraiser for the majority leader in his corporate offices.\n\nThe week before, we uncovered the fact that a couple of SolarReserve (with its $737 million loan) board members are big Democrat donors, including contributions to Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign as well as Senator Reid. The Washington Free Beacon divulged, \u201c\u2026Nevada Geothermal, Ormat Nevada, and SolarReserve\u2014are located in Reid\u2019s home state. Executives from all three companies have donated to Reid and his fellow Democrats, contributing more than $58,000 since 2008.\u201d\n\nHowever, what you are about discover is that the two projects we\u2019ll profile in this chapter have similar direct ties, some sly connections to the Senator, and some stinky consequences.\n\nNevada Geothermal Power\n\nFirst we\u2019ll look into Nevada Geothermal Power (NGP) as recent news exposes that its power is dimming. NGP may be the next green-energy bankruptcy.\n\nHere\u2019s the NGP thumbnail presented in the introduction to the green-energy crony-corruption story:\n\nNevada Geothermal Power (NGP) holds leasehold interests in six geothermal projects located in the Western United States. They hold a BB+ rating and received a $78.8 million loan , guaranteed by the DOE, in September of 2010. Executives from NGP contributed in 2008 to Harry Reid\u2019s campaign.\n\nAdditionally, since 2009, NGP was the recipient of more than $69 million in federal grants, under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n\nThe New York Times reports: \u201cReid was instrumental in securing that financing for Nevada Geothermal.\u201d The NYT noted: \u201cMr. Reid has taken the nascent geothermal industry under his wing, pressuring the Department of Interior to move more quickly on applications to build clean energy projects on federally owned land and urging other members of Congress to expand federal tax incentives to help build geothermal plants, benefits that Nevada Geothermal has taken advantage of.\u201d You might think Reid has altruistic motives, such as creating jobs for his state, however, as the NYT points out: \u201cMr. Reid has received some support from the industry, in the form of at least $43,000 worth of campaign contributions from the geothermal industry since 2009, according to an analysis of federal campaign finance records.\u201d The \u201ccampaign contributions\u201d could be why, in a 2010 press release , he declared \u201cNorthern Nevada is the Saudi Arabia of geothermal energy.\u201d\n\nDespite the flowery rhetoric, at the time the DOE approved the conditional loan guarantee in September 2010, they were well aware of NGP\u2019s \u201cwell-documented\u201d financial difficulties. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee (HOGRC) called the loan a \u201cbailout \u201d\u2014which \u201cviolated the spirit and, quite possibly, the letter of the law\u201d and provided \u201can opportunity for private industry to exit an investment, deleverage and transfer the extraordinarily high default risk to taxpayers.\u201d\n\nLess than a year after the loan was issued, leading accounting firm Deloitte & Touche did an audit of NGP and concluded : \u201csignificant doubt\u201d about Nevada Geothermal Power\u2019s \u201cability to continue as a going concern.\u201d The company\u2019s vital signs are not looking good: it \u201chas incurred net losses over the past several years, has an accumulated deficit of $44.0 million and an anticipated inability to retire its long-term liabilities.\u201d\n\nThe project continued to have \u201coperational and financial problems.\u201d In the October 2011 NYT article , it states: \u201cExecutives expressed confidence that they can recover\u201d and that \u201cthe government investment is not at risk.\u201d As CEO Brian D. Fairbank stated: \u201cWe\u2019re doing OK.\u201d\n\nDuring Fairbank\u2019s \u201cGreen Energy Gamble\u201d May 16, 2012 testimony before the HOGRC , he spoke \u201cabout the many good things occurring at Blue Mountain\u201d and stated that they \u201cremained bullish on the future of geothermal resource potential\u201d at Blue Mountain. However, the future of Nevada Geothermal is looking dim , it still faces financial problems, and the company\u2019s internal auditors have questioned whether it can stay in business.\n\nThe audit report states: \u201cNGP has incurred $98 million in net losses over the past several years, has substantial debts and does not generate enough cash from its current operations after debt-service costs.\u201d\n\nWith the audit completed in March 2012, one as to wonder how much did Fairbanks actually know about the status of NGP during that May 16 testimony when he claimed he \u201cremained bullish?\u201d\n\nAnother angle, in that DOE press release, both Secretary Chu and Senator Reid praised the potential job creation of the NGP project. Chu said: \u201cOur support for the Blue Mountain project is part of the Administration\u2019s commitment to reducing carbon emissions while creating clean energy jobs,\u201d and Reid: \u201cclean energy projects like Blue Mountain geothermal that will put Nevadans back to work...\u201d In conflict with these claims, the HOGRC report states: \u201cIt was known to him [Secretary Chu] at that time [of the press conference], however, that the loan would not create a single job, but instead would simply refinance an existing loan, despite DOE\u2019s claim that it would create over 200 jobs\u201d\n\nInstead of using the loan as Title XVI, Section 1602 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, requires: \u201cRecipients shall use grant funds in a manner that maximizes job creation and economic benefit,\u201d the loan was used to pay off a creditor. According to the Washington Times report, \u201cAt the time the Energy Department announced its conditional approval of the guarantee, Mr. Issa said NGP would have defaulted on a loan from TCW Asset Management Co., then its primary lender, \u2018had DOE not swooped in to save the failing company with taxpayer money.\u2019 A committee report said the loan did not finance any new construction and \u2018did not help to create a single job.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo, Senator Reid received money from the geothermal industry, he, apparently, then pressured the DOE to fund projects in Nevada based on the false promise of job creation\u2014which he knew was not accurate at the time. Instead of creating jobs, Reid\u2019s advocacy actually \u201cbailed out\u201d his cronies\u2014that is really corrupt.\n\nOrmat Nevada\n\nBut the story continues. As we reported in the introduction , Kai Anderson, a lobbyist for NGP\u2019s partner corporation, Ormat Technologies, Inc., is a former Senate aide to Harry Reid. Ormat\u2019s CEO Paul Thomsen is another former Reid aide. Additionally, according to the Washington Times, \u201cMr. Fairbank denied knowing or lobbying Mr. Reid, but the House Oversight Committee said Ormat Inc., which was paid $80 million to build NGP\u2019s Blue Mountain plant, has \u2018strong ties\u2019 to the senator.\u201d\n\nThe thumbnail of Ormat in the introduction reads as follows:\n\nOrmat Nevada is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ormat Technologies, Inc., whose website touts \u201cgreen energy you can rely on.\u201d They have an S&P rating of BB and received $350 million in partial loan guarantees. Ormat\u2019s lobbyist Kai Anderson and Director of Policy and Business Development Paul Thomsen were both former senate aides to Harry Reid and donors to his campaign.\n\nThe May 2012 HOGRC report expands the connections: \u201cDuring Senator Reid\u2019s 2010 reelection campaign, Thomsen starred in a campaign ad for Senator Reid to advertise the benefits of Ormat\u2019s loan guarantee for Nevada. In addition to Anderson and Thomsen, Ormat\u2019s President, Yoram Bronicki, gave thousands in political contributions to Senator Reid. The strong ties between the company and the Senate Majority leader raise questions about whether the DOE acted in the best interests of the American people when it approved the loan guarantee.\u201d\n\nYoram Bronicki is the son of Ms. Yehudit Bronicki (also known as Dita). She is CEO and Director of Ormat Technologies. In addition to the $350 million loan guaranteed by the DOE with John Hancock in aggregate principal amount, Ormat Technologies\u2019 projects received more than $200 million in various DOE grants .\n\nThe 2010 campaign ad , starring former Reid staffer Thomsen, heralded \u201cGeothermal means 16,000 Nevada jobs\u2026 Harry Reid saw the potential just before everybody else.\u201d With projects like NGP, it seems those jobs have never materialized and the reason Harry Reid was such a soothsayer is the same reason a fortune teller tells you what you want to hear: you are holding the money. With the geothermal industry \u201ccontributing more than $58,000 since 2008\u201d and, in just these two stories, receiving $700 million in loans and grants, they\u2019ve gotten an amazing return on their investment. In the bad economy, the best way to grow your money just may be to invest in green energy\u2014just make sure you have friends in high places.\n\nAll this, and it does nothing to \u201cbring us closer to energy independence.\u201d Geothermal\u2014and wind and solar\u2014power generates electricity. America is already electricity independent. We have enough coal, natural gas, and uranium to power us for centuries! We even export coal, we have so much.\n\nSo why are we killing good-paying jobs in the coal industry, preventing thousands of union jobs the Keystone pipeline would create, and potentially putting thousands out of work with a pending ban on hydraulic fracturing for natural gas extraction, for the supposed jobs in green energy\u2014when we are already electricity independent? These green-energy projects can only raise the cost of electricity and waste public money, while the energy sources the administration\u2019s efforts are killing or blocking can actually reduce costs\u2014without taxpayer investment.\n\nThe green-energy crony-corruption story is explains it all.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Thanks to Christine Lakatos, the Green Corruption blogger for research assistance.", "description": "So far our chronicle of the green-energy crony-corruption story, has .10/07/2019 3:39:07AM EST.", "authors": ["Marita Noon", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2012-07-14"}
