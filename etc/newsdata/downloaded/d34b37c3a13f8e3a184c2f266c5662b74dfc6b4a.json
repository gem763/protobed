The player\u2019s dramatic sacking for posting religiously-inspired homophobic comments on social media was arguably the greatest distraction that a national rugby team has ever endured and while the Wallabies say they have moved on, few Australian players would have been untouched by the furore one way or another.\n\nOwen Farrell changes tackle technique amid fear of red and yellow cards Read more\n\nMany of the Pacific Islanders in the squad would have been sympathetic towards Folau\u2019s religious viewpoints, while others would have condemned his anti-gay comments. It was an issue that threatened to tear the Wallabies apart. Yet they seem to have managed the situation fairly well during the Rugby Championship and Bledisloe Cup series.\n\nThat does not mean Folau is completely out of the Wallabies\u2019 thoughts. Coach Michael Cheika revealed on Saturday that he has been threatened and abused by angry fans over the player\u2019s sacking, indicating the spectre of Folau was still hanging over the team. And if Folau was on the coach\u2019s mind, it is probably safe to assume he was on the players\u2019 minds as well, if only sub-consciously.\n\nYou could not blame a player for wondering whether the Wallabies would be a better team with Folau in it and whether they would have more chance of winning the World Cup, even if the thought was at the back of the mind. Fans have been asking themselves that very question; it is hard to imagine that you could take away a team\u2019s most prolific try-scorer \u2013 Folau was the Wallabies\u2019 fourth highest try-scorer in history with 32 tries in 62 Tests \u2013 without having some kind of effect.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nThere is still plenty of potency in the Wallabies\u2019 back three with fullback Kurtley Beale and wingers Marika Koroibete and Reece Hodge, but none have the same strike power as Folau, who may well have thrived in the team\u2019s new attacking system. With powerful inside-centre Samu Kerevi and big ball-carriers in the forwards getting across the advantage-line, Folau most likely would have been a greater threat than previously, when at times he struggled to get into the game. That would be a source of frustration for the Wallabies whether they wanted to admit it or not.\n\nThe Wallabies finished second in the Rugby Championship behind the Springboks and took a Test off the All Blacks in the Bledisloe Cup series, but no one will really know how much they miss Folau until the World Cup is underway. He under-performed at the 2015 World Cup in England because of a nagging ankle injury and the Wallabies would have anticipated a much bigger impact from him in Japan, almost a bonus.\n\nAir of unpredictability hangs over Rugby World Cup with adaptability the key | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nApart from his threat as a strike weapon, Folau was also the safest Wallaby player under the high ball with aerial skills that were second to none in world rugby. Beale can be susceptible to the high ball and teams are sure to employ the tactic against the Wallabies in Japan\u2019s hot and humid conditions. The Wallabies\u2019 other fullback option, Dane Haylett-Petty, is safe under the high ball, but lacks the attacking flair of Folau or Beale.\n\nBut Beale possesses attributes that Folau did not. While Folau was a supreme athlete, Beale is a more intuitive rugby player and brings playmaking skills to the fullback position, which have the potential to add more variety to the Wallabies\u2019 attack. Beale can be lethal in attack as an individual, but he can also create opportunities for other players, a similar threat to the one posed by All Blacks five-eighth-cum-fullback Beauden Barrett. A super-sub at the 2015 World Cup, Beale needs to produce for the full 80 minutes as a starter in Japan to more than adequately replace Folau.\n\nIf the Wallabies perform disappointingly at the World Cup, Folau will become the biggest what-if story at the tournament, re-igniting debate over Rugby Australia\u2019s handling of the issue. No one will ever really know for sure whether the Wallabies would have been better with Folau or not. But whether the Wallabies win the World Cup or not the threats and abuse over Folau\u2019s sacking will most likely continue at least until the matter is resolved in court or quite possibly well beyond that. Folau may be gone, but he has not yet been forgotten.", "description": "If the Wallabies perform disappointingly in Japan, the debate over Rugby Australia\u2019s handling of the issue may reignite", "authors": ["Bret Harris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/871279cd5979e5348c151cdcf9cb1abb2856c79f/0_179_5392_3236/master/5392.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9db04665e64b879d5ce5acd16b04a848", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
