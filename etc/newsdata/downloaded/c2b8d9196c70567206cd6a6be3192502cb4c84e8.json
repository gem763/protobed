Viacom began its media life as CBS Films in 1952 and served as the syndication division of the CBS broadcast network. Sixteen years later it was renamed CBS Enterprises and was re-christened again in 1970 as Viacom (which was an acronym of Video & Audio Communications). In 1971, CBS and Viacom split for the first time due to the FCC's creation of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules which prevented CBS, ABC and NBC from owning any of the programming they aired or selling any programs where any of the networks had a financial stake. Those rules were abolished in 1993.\n\nSHARI REDSTONE POISED TO BE QUEEN OF ALL MEDIA\n\nSeven years after the removal of the \"Fin-Syn\" rules, CBS and Viacom re-united. But in 2006, National Amusements CEO Sumner Redstone and the longtime force behind Viacom (National Amusements bought Viacom in 1986) decided to spin-off CBS effectively reversing the merger.\n\nRedstone\u2019s daughter, Shari Redstone, will be board chair of ViacomCBS once the merger is completed and Bob Bakish, Viacom's current chief, will be the CEO of the combined companies.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "National Amusements moves Viacom-CBS merger to an \"early december\" close.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/CBS-Viacom-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
