Yes, but time is running out before the October 31 deadline as the European Parliament would also need to ratify it. Without a meaningful vote, support for the agreement has not yet been tested. Though the PM has attracted support from a number of prominent Brexiteer Tories, the DUP is strongly opposed to the deal. - If there is to be another vote, when will it happen? Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, said the government wants to hold another meaningful vote on Mr Johnson's deal on Monday. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said he would consider whether to allow the government's plans. Welsh Labour MP Chris Bryant said, in a point of order, that it is not good practice for a Government to keep holding debates on the exact same subject. If a vote does happen, one unnamed Scottish opposition MP has been quoted as saying next week will not be a simple case of the Government just winning a vote on their new deal. 'We'll amend it (over and over). It'll be totally disfigured. A different bill entirely,' the MP reportedly said. - What about the letters sent last night? Under the terms of the so-called Benn Act, which was passed against the PM's wishes, Mr Johnson was compelled to write to the EU asking for a three-month Brexit extension if he had not secured a deal by 11pm UK time on October 19. He sent one unsigned letter asking for a delay, another making clear the first was from MPs and a third urging the EU not to grant an extension. - Will the EU agree to an extension? Despite European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker raising doubts over another Brexit delay, the decision needs to be taken by all 27 remaining EU states, not him. However, the EU could set a different length to an extension, either shorter or longer than the three-month one cited in the Benn Act. The EU could decide not to formally respond to such a letter from the PM until it sees if Mr Johnson can get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through Parliament next week.\n\nThe DUP votes might well give Mr Johnson a comfortable margin, but it seems steadfast in its opposition to the plan, which replaces an earlier divorce deal negotiated by Theresa May's government but rejected thrice by Parliament.\n\nLeader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Government planned another vote on Monday, although Speaker John Bercow could block it.\n\nMr Johnson faces a frenzied week in Westminster, and possibly the courts, as he tries to woo rebellious MPs in time to meet the October 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nThe Prime Minister last night sent an unsigned request to extend the Brexit process, along with two further letters which make clear he opposes such a delay.\n\nEU officials haven't yet responded to his request for more time. They are torn between a wish to finally put the Brexit issue to bed and a devout desire to avoid the economic ramification of Britain leaving without a divorce deal in place.\n\nMonday will also feature more legal action, more arm-twisting, cajoling and veiled threats by Mr Johnson and his ministers and more amendments designed by lawmakers to stymie his plan to have Britain leave the 28-nation bloc on Halloween.\n\nIn the midst of all this, EU leaders and officials across the English Channel were pondering whether to grant the British leader a Brexit extension that he doesn't even want.\n\n'My view, and the government's position, (is) that a further extension would damage the interests of the U.K. and our EU partners, and the relationship between us,' Mr Johnson wrote to European Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nHis decision to send a second letter saying he doesn't really want an extension is likely to trigger court challenges from opponents who believe he intentionally set out to block Parliament's intent even if he technically complied with legal requirements.\n\nThe Court of Session in Scotland is already considering the matter and it may end up being decided in the U.K. Supreme Court, which in September ruled that Johnson had acted unlawfully when he suspended Parliament for five weeks as the Brexit deadline crept closer.\n\nScottish National Party legislator Joanna Cherry, part of a group that brought the earlier successful case against Johnson, said the legal battle over Brexit continues.\n\n'We're back in court on Monday morning and it will be possible then to secure the court's assistance if the prime minister has flouted the law and the promises he gave to the court,' she said.\n\nBoris Johnson (pictured in Downing Street yesterday) last night sent a reluctant, unsigned request to extend the Brexit process beyond October 31 after MPs failed to back his deal in the Commons yesterday\n\nThe court action is aimed at keeping Johnson from taking Britain out of the EU without a deal.\n\nMr Johnson has long declared that he plans to take the U.K. out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a divorce deal, and his minister in charge of Brexit again emphasised that stance.\n\nWhat is happening on Brexit this week? Monday: The government will try to force a 'meaningful vote' on Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. But John Bercow could block it from happening. The government will also introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Tuesday: MPs will debate the Withdrawal Agreement for the first time. There will be a second reading vote - assuming the 'meaningful vote' does not go ahead on Monday this will be the first time MPs get a straight forward vote on Mr Johnson's deal. Wednesday and Thursday: Assuming the Withdrawal Agreement clears its second reading it will then move onto its further Commons stages. This is when amendments are likely to be voted on. Friday: If Mr Johnson has not managed to make significant progress on the passage of the WAB, or if he has failed to win a vote on his deal, attention will shift to Brussels to see if an extension will be offered and whether an emergency summit will be called for October 28.\n\n'We are going to leave by October 31st,' Michael Gove old Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday. 'We have the means and the ability to do so.'\n\nGove also said he was holding a special meeting to discuss Operation Yellowhammer, the Government's 'no-deal' planning apparatus, to make sure Britain is ready to leave.\n\nThe Government's own analysts have warned an abrupt break with the EU could lead to recession, massive delays at British ports, and shortages in food and prescription medicine.\n\nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said Tusk would consult with other leaders 'in the next days' about Mr Johnson's request, but most signs indicate the EU would prefer an extension to an abrupt no-deal Brexit.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne, whose country holds the European Union's rotating presidency, said Sunday 'it makes sense to allow extra time.'\n\nWhile Mr Johnson's Conservatives are focused on getting more votes, the opposition Labour Party was calling for a second referendum on the whole question of leaving the EU.\n\nLabour's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said it is 'inevitable' that lawmakers opposed to Brexit will put forward an amendment seeking a second referendum - something strongly opposed by Mr Johnson and his government.\n\n'Whether it's this deal or any future deal, it's got to go back so the public can say, \"Do you want to leave on these terms?\"' Starmer said. 'If so, then we do. If not, we remain.'", "description": "Dominic Raab told Andrew Marr: 'We seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons, we don't know that but from what people have said ..
