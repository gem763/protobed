A spokesman for Uniper said the group remained committed to start commercial operations at Datteln 4 in summer 2020.\n\n($1 = 0.8990 euros) (Reporting by Markus Wacket; writing by Christoph Steitz; editing by Thomas Seythal)", "description": "BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German utility Uniper  will be able to start commercial operations at its 1.5 billion  euro ($1.7 billion) Datteln 4 coal-fired...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
