(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) Associated Press\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Nationals leadoff hitter Trea Turner was called out and Washington manager Dave Martinez was ejected from Game 6 of the World Series after a disputed interference call in the seventh inning Tuesday night.\n\nWith a runner at first, Turner hit a slow roller down the third base line and ran for first narrowly inside fair territory.\n\nPitcher Brad Peacock fielded the ball and his throw pulled first baseman Yuli Gurriel toward the baseline. As Gurriel stretched, Turner ran into his glove, and the ball bounced off Turner's leg and into foul territory. Turner ended up at second, with lead runner Yan Gomes going to third \u2014 except home plate umpire Sam Holbrook quickly signaled for interference.\n\nTurner was called out and Gomes sent back to first base. After some argument from Martinez and the Nationals, umpire went to the headsets for 4 \u00bd minutes before signaling to uphold the call.\n\nIt sounded as if the Nationals wanted to pursue a protest. Turner was heard on television pointing to Major League Baseball chief baseball officer Joe Torre and shouting \"He's right there!\" and \"Just ask him!\" while umpires were on the headsets.\n\nTwo batters after play resumed, Anthony Rendon hit a two-run homer to put Washington ahead 5-2. Eaton added a two-run double for a 7-2 lead in the ninth.\n\nMartinez stepped onto the field to talk with Holbrook and crew chief Gary Cederstrom after the inning and quickly became animated. Six weeks after having a heart procedure, Martinez was restrained by bench coach Chip Hale \u2014 or at least Hale tried \u2014 as the manager kept shouting and eventually was tossed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: and", "description": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Nationals leadoff hitter Trea Turner was called out and Washington manager Dave Martinez was ejected from Game 6 of the World Series after a disputed interference call in the seventh inning Tuesday night.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
