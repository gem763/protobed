Fans in attendance loudly yelled \"lock him up,\" a chant Trump supporters began in 2016 directed at his opponent and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump did not sit with the Lerner family, the principal owners of the Nationals. According to WUSA, a representative for the Lerner family requested that MLB not put the family in a position to turn down a request from the White House to sit with Trump.\n\nExcept Trump, every president since William Taft in 1910 has thrown out a ceremonial first pitch, either for Opening Day, the All-Star Game or the World Series. In 2010, President Obama threw out the first pitch on Opening Day at Nationals Park to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Presidential Opening Day first pitches.\n\nAccording to MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, Trump decided not to throw out the ceremonial first pitch \"in order to make the fan experience as positive as possible.\"\n\nSunday marked Trump's first major league game since he took office in 2017.\n\nThe Astros and Nationals are tied in the series, 2-2.", "description": "Fans loudly chanted \"lock him up\" when Trump was shown on the big screen at Nationals Park.", "authors": ["Alaa Abdeldaiem"], "top_image": "https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY3OTE3MzY2NDAxODM2NDE2/donald-trump-booed-nationals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
