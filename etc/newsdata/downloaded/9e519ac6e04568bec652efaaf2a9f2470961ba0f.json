We\u2019ll see what transpires between now and tonight,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBut he says he feels good. As of right now, he\u2019ll definitely start Game 7.\u201d\n\nMartinez said Scherzer had a throwing session in the outfield at Minute Maid Park before Game 6. The veteran pitcher received a cortisone injection Sunday to alleviate the pain in his neck.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t do anything for 24 hours,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe definitely flew with us [to Houston]. He was in a neck brace. We sat him in first class, so he had a lot of room. \u2026 He threw flat ground today after not being able to move his neck and [trapezius] for two days. We\u2019re at the point now where we\u2019ll see how he feels in the next couple of hours.\u201d\n\nRight-hander Joe Ross replaced Scherzer on the mound in Game 5. The Astros beat the Nationals 7-1 to grab a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series.\n\nThe Nationals will send Stephen Strasburg to the mound in Game 6 against Justin Verlander. If Scherzer experiences a setback and can\u2019t start Wednesday, Anibal Sanchez would be expected to pitch on regular rest.", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 Washington Nationals ace Max Scherzer was cleared to return after being scratched from his Game 5 start because of severe neck", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
