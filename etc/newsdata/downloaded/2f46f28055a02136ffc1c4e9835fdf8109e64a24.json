The showcase features some of the most prestigious developers in the industry, such as (in no particular order) Bandar Utama, Gamuda, Malton, Platinum Victory, Land & General, Sunsuria, Symphony Life, BRDB, Hunza Properties, Cicet Asia and more.\n\nLearn more about the Home Ownership Campaign.\n\nREHDA Youth pledges to channel the proceeds raised from the MAPEX Property Showcase back to the community through our selected Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes.\n\nThe two selected CSR programmes are rebuilding a Children\u2019s Centre for the Women Aid\u2019s Organisation (WAO) and building a multipurpose hall for SMK MakMandin, Penang. The Children\u2019s Centre will offer counseling and care services for disadvantaged children. The centre will be platinum-rated green to help the Centre reduce its daily operation costs.\n\nFor the SMK Mak Mandin project, students will benefit from having a usable multipurpose hall. Dato\u2019 Sri Dr. Lee Ville, Chairman of REHDA Youth said, \u201cThe funds collected would be divided for both CSR projects and will be used to finance the cost of construction. We hope the funds raised from this event will help provide a better environment for the community\u201d.\n\nWomen Aid\u2019s Organisation (WAO) will have a booth over the 5-day exhibition period to explain about the project and collect donations on-site. By supporting this initiative, it will go a long way to help WAO support women and children who have experienced violence so they can heal and thrive.\n\nThere is also RM30,000 worth of ONECARD U Points to be given away to MAPEX visitors via passport redemption and contest. Visitors will also enjoy numerous activities such as face painting, quick sketch, walkabout clown, balloon giveaway, and colouring contest, so parents can look for their dream home in peace while children can participate in these fun activities.\n\nIn addition, successful transactions during this exhibition period entitles purchasers a chance to win up to RM1,000 ONECARD U Points.\n\nWe would like to encourage visitors to use this opportunity to take advantage of the tax incentives that the government has announced in conjunction with the HOC 2019 and also make donations to help the domestic violence survivors.\n\nFor further information, please contact the REHDA Youth Secretariat at: 03-7803 2978.", "description": "REHDA Youth announced its second 2019 MAPEX Property Showcase in conjunction with Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) which will take place from Nov 6 \u2013 10 at LG Oval, 1Utama Shopping Centre from 10am \u2013 10pm.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Pcq9YmK8uzyz4b23S6xOTw--~B/aD0yNjE3O3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/propertyguru_my_775/2de90da9f5c5d7d275f7c9ba48ab0569", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
