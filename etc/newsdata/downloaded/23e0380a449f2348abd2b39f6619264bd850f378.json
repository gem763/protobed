The complaint also claims that White House officials attempted to cover up the misconduct.\n\nAfter the White House released a summary the July 25 phone call at the center of the complaint and congressional investigators released a redacted version of the complaint, Trump began openly calling on foreign leaders to investigate the Biden family over Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings while his father was vice president.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House earlier Thursday.\n\n\u201cI would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump also said.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) launched a formal impeachment probe into the growing scandal after the whistleblower complaint pointed to clear evidence of Trump soliciting foreign interference in the election.\n\nPence has been drawn into the scandal after The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the vice president\u2019s top aide was on the phone call in which Trump pushed Zelensky to look into the Bidens. According to the Post, Pence would have had a copy of the transcript of the call before he met with Zelensky in September.\n\nHowever, an official who spoke to the paper said Pence wasn\u2019t aware of Trump\u2019s efforts to encourage an investigation.\n\nSpeaking at the roundtable on Thursday, Pence said Trump had tasked him with meeting with Zelensky to discuss a \u201clack of European support\u201d and \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nHe continued to defend Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, insisting that \u201cthe president was raising issues that were appropriate and of genuine interest to the American people.\u201d\n\n\"They\u2019ve literally spent two and a half years pushing an impeachment of this administration.\" @VP slams Democrats for harassing @realDonaldTrump\n\nover his call with Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\"Anyone that looks at the transcript will see the president was raising issues that were appropriate.\" pic.twitter.com/PAVGDMRsWk \u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 3, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s calls for a Biden investigation stem from Hunter Biden\u2019s position as a board member of a Ukrainian gas company. The president has been pushing the debunked theory that then-Vice President Joe Biden called for the removal of a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor to impede an investigation into the company.\n\nAt the time, a bipartisan group of lawmakers had also pushed for anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, as CNN reported. Ukrainian authorities later cleared Hunter Biden of any wrongdoing.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nFormer Ukraine President Says Joe Biden Never Asked To Close Cases\n\nRepublicans Signed Letter Supporting The Ukraine Reforms Biden Was Pushing\n\nFEC Chair, Again: Soliciting Foreign Election Help Is Illegal\n\nThe Impeachment Story Is Simple.
