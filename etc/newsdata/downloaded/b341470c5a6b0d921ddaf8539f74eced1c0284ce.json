The company's social media channels are full of anxious customers asking if their vacations will be cancelled or if they will be able to get back home.\n\nThe company is telling them that is doing everything to avoid the collapse.\n\nIn the UK, the government is setting up a plan in case they need to step in and repatriate the holidaymakers.\n\nThomas Cook has 21,000 employees worldwide, operates in 16 countries, and serves an estimated 22 million customers a year.\n\nThe Transport Salaried Staffs Association, which represents Thomas Cook staff, appealed to the government to step in with \"real financial support\".\n\nManuel Cortes, the group's general secretary, wrote to the government calling on it to \"act if required and save this iconic cornerstone of the British high street and the thousands of jobs that go with it.\"\n\nHe wrote: \"Thomas Cook can be a highly successful business and must be given every opportunity to flourish. I urge you to stand ready to assist Thomas Cook with real financial support.\n\n\"The company must be rescued no matter what. No British government in its right mind would countenance the loss of so many jobs and the prospect of just one major travel operator \u2013 TUI \u2013 controlling the mass market.\"\n\nAlthough it raked in more than \u20ac10 billion in annual sales last year it has revealed a loss of around \u20ac1.6 billion for the first half of this year.\n\nThe bankruptcy of the company could affect big holidays markets like Spain, Greece, and Turkey, its shareholders, lending banks, and the landlords of all its stores.\n\nThomas Cook shares have tumbled almost 20% on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe British Airlines Pilots Association called on the government to intervene.\n\nThe Department for Transport and the company both declined to comment to Reuters.", "description": "The firm requires an additional \u20ac226 million to survive, in addition to the \u20ac1 billion it raised last month in a recapitalisation plan with Chinese shareholder Fosun.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/17/19/00/1000x563_cmsv2_2ea6cad3-6733-5c62-9bbc-ef88ac6b35e5-4171900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
