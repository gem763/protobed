It landed about 90 miles (150km) south-east of the Kazakh town of Zhezkazgan.\n\nAl-Mansoori's team wrapped the smiling astronaut in his country's flag before taking him away for more health checks.\n\nThe former military pilot will return home to a hero's welcome as his flight last month was widely celebrated across the country, and Dubai's tallest skyscraper, the Burj Khalifa was lit up to mark the launch.\n\n'The crew that returned to Earth is feeling well,' the Russian space agency Roscosmos said immediately after the landing.\n\nHague and Ovchinin completed a 203-day mission aboard the lab while Mansoori's two crewmates from his September 25 launch, Russia's Oleg Skripochka and NASA's Jessica Meir, are staying on as part of a six-member team.\n\nThe UAE has a fledgling space program with big ambitions. It launched its first locally made satellite, KhalifaSat, in October from Japan, and it also wants to launch a probe to Mars in 2020.\n\nThree NASA astronauts, a European Space Agency crew member and two Russians remain aboard the orbiting lab to continue their work on hundreds of scientific experiments.\n\nUAE astronaut Hazzaa al-Mansoori (left), Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka and US astronaut Jessica Meir headed to the ISS in September\n\nUAE astronaut Hazzaa al-Mansoori spent eight days on the ISS\n\nThe Soyuz rocket blasted off to the ISS in September\n\nThe UAE's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest skyscraper, was lit up with an image of Hazzaa al-Mansoori before he began his ISS mission\n\nRescue vehicles approach to the Russian Soyuz MS-12 space capsule landing about 150 km (90 miles) south-east of the Kazakh town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2019.
