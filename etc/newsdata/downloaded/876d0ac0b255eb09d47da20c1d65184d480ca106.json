He\u2019s also the most expensive player in the slate. The availability of alternative aces like Max Scherzer and Luis Castillo could help to keep Cole\u2019s ownership at a manageable level, although I do expect him to be the most popular hurler. The Royals offense has some modest bright spots, but it\u2019s still among the weakest in the league. Kauffman Stadium should further serve to aid Cole in his DFS point gathering.\n\nAlso Consider: Max Scherzer, Luis Castillo, Adam Wainwright (value), Tyler Beede (value), Adrian Houser (value)\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nLuke Voit \u2013 New York Yankees (at Anthony Kay)\n\nStory continues\n\nVoit is a double threat, offering one of the best first baseman projections and a relatively low cost. He\u2019s visiting the Blue Jays. Their rookie starter managed to skate through his debut while mostly avoiding damage, but he\u2019s unlikely to repeat the feat. While Kay has some long-term potential, at present he\u2019s an unfinished product with shaky command and no reliable weapons. Let us not forget the Blue Jays terrible bullpen too. Voit has a one-in-four chance to homer. His OBP-heavy profile promises run production too.\n\nAlso Consider: Sean Murphy (value), Austin Hedges (value), Jake Rogers (value), Eric Hosmer (value), Matt Olson, Pete Alonso\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nJonathan Villar \u2013 Baltimore Orioles (at Jordan Zimmermann)\n\nVillar recently received credit for hitting the home run that broke the single-season leaguewide record. He\u2019s hammered a career high 21 big flies despite no indication he\u2019s actually improved as a hitter. In fact, his 27.9 percent hard contact rate is among the worst in the league. He\u2019s a ground ball hitter who is best targeted for his potential to slap multiple hits and perhaps steal some bases. Consider combining him with other Orioles. Zimmermann rarely records strikeouts and can skew a little towards fly ball contact. Villar has a little under a one-in-five chance for a home run, although you should not pick him for potential power output. As with Voit, don\u2019t forget there\u2019s a bad bullpen hiding behind Zimmermann.\n\nAlso Consider: Gleyber Torres, Jose Altuve, DJ LeMahieu, Greg Garcia (value), Nick Solak (value), Josh VanMeter (value), Sheldon Neuse (value)\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nMatt Chapman \u2013 Oakland Athletics (at Brock Burke)\n\nChapman is one of the best hitters in the slate. He\u2019s priced like a typical upper-mid-tier bat. It\u2019s always a good idea to target Chapman against southpaws \u2013 he\u2019s a verified lefty masher. This season, a low BABIP is hiding otherwise gaudy power numbers versus opposite-handed pitchers. As a bonus, he transforms into a fly ball hitter when with the platoon advantage. Burke is an extreme ground ball guy. The juxtaposition promises power potential for Chapman \u2013 nearly a one-in-three chance to go yard.\n\nAlso Consider: Nolan Arenado, Manny Machado, Yoan Moncada, Rio Ruiz (value)\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nTrevor Story \u2013 Colorado Rockies (vs Joey Lucchesi)\n\nYou didn\u2019t think we were going to overlook a Coors Field game, did you? Lucchesi is having a strong season, and he\u2019s tamped down on his past issues against right-handed hitters. However, he is a ground ball pitcher while Story is a lefty-mashing fly ball hitter. He\u2019s the top projected hitter in the slate. Not only does he have a one-in-three shot at a homer, he\u2019s also among the most obvious plays for multiple deep shots.\n\nAlso Consider: Marcus Semien, Machado, Torres, Alex Bregman, Villar, Luis Urias (value)\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nNick Martini \u2013 San Diego Padres (at Jeff Hoffman)\n\nIf we\u2019re going to cover one side of the Coors Field, we ought to touch in on the other side. Martini is expected to bat second for the Padres. If so, he\u2019s one of the top value plays in the slate. He\u2019s not much of a home run threat, although there\u2019s at least some chance for a park and juiced ball fueled home run. Instead, you\u2019re hoping for multiple hits and plentiful run production. The Rockies home park doesn\u2019t just boost power output. The spacious pastures aid line driver-oriented spray hitters like Martini too. Hoffman is completely hapless when pitching at home.\n\nAristides Aquino \u2013 Cincinnati Reds (at Mike Leake)\n\nAh, remember the good ol\u2019 days when Aquino was a daily bargain? (about a month ago)\u2026\n\nThis hulking Franmil Reyes clone is the top projected home run threat. He has a 37 percent shot at a yakker. Multiple slams are well within grasp. He\u2019s a pull-heavy fly ball hitter who makes frequent hard contact \u2013 the perfect profile for socking dingers. Leake is a homer prone (1.82 HR/9) ground ball pitcher \u2013 an ideal matchup for Aquino. Since joining the Diamondbacks, Leake has forgotten how to miss bats.\n\nAlso Consider: Charlie Blackmon, Mark Canha (value) Aaron Judge (value), Nick Martini (value), Khris Davis (value), Josh Naylor (value), Wil Myers, Josh Rojas (value)", "description": "Brad Johnson finds the best MLB DFS Plays for Friday, September 13.
