Gregory Meeks (D-NY), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, told MSNBC host Joy Reid he believes more \"patriotic Americans\" will come forward with whistleblower complaints against President Donald Trump.\n\n\"One of the many things that may be keeping Donald Trump up at night is the concept of the whistleblower. There\u2019s the first one, a CIA employee who flagged to Congress that Trump pressured Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and root around for proof of Trump and Giuliani\u2019s pro-Russia conspiracy theories. And now, potentially a second whistleblower on Ukraine. Another intelligence official who The New York Times says could come forward soon, citing two people briefed on the matter,\" Reid said in her monologue.\n\n\"And then, there\u2019s the whistleblower that must eat at Donald Trump the most, because this one has quietly raised the alarm about Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. According to the Washington Post, an IRS official reported that they were told that at least one treasury department political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president\u2019s or the vice president\u2019s tax returns. It\u2019s a process that\u2019s supposed to be protected from political interference,\" she said. \"it does now appear that there is yet another whistleblower who could come forward, potentially, and challenge \u2014 and this is not saying release the tax returns but saying that there was some interference with the way that Donald Trump was audited. Your thoughts? \"\n\n\"My thoughts is, I think there is going to be a wave of patriotic Americans who are going to start coming forward, because there\u2019s been a lot of things that have taken place behind the scenes and the cover-up has begun by this president,\" Meeks replied.\n\n\"So, I think \u2014 you know, for example, I just did an op Ed not too long ago. If you remember a year ago, there was a group of folks called Anonymous, that they were trying to hold things from within,\" he explained.\n\n\"Well, a year later, you see that this president would not be able to be contained from within, and so, folks are going to start stepping up and start talking about what they\u2019ve seen behind the scenes, because they realize it\u2019s time for it to be courageous and to be patriotic,\" Meeks said. \"So, I think that you\u2019ll hear things about this income tax as well as various other pieces will start coming through because people are going to start standing up.\"\n\nHouse Democrats are currently pursing an impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower filed a complaint claiming President Donald Trump wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. While Vice President Joe Biden was handling international relations with Ukraine his son, Hunter, was being paid $50,000 a month by a Ukrainian gas company, despite having no experience in natural energy. Democrats have said Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine if the investigation didn't take place. Transcripts from the call prove that to be false.", "description": "Democratic delusion. .10/05/2019 18:45:58PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/278/3aa95ae3-a36a-4cb4-b1be-cba4f2670a42.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
