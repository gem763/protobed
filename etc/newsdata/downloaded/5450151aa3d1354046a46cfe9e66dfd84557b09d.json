Avoid toxic co-workers and culture, Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan tells SMU graduands", "language": "en", "text": "Min-Liang Tan, Razer CEO, also said he \u201cconveniently\u201d forgot to tell his parents he was no longer a lawyer when he quit to start up the company. YouTube screengrab/Razer\n\nFresh graduates eager to carve out their own success in life need to first ensure they\u2019re working with the right people, Min-Liang Tan, one of Singapore\u2019s most well-known tech CEOs has said.\n\nThe Razer chief executive and co-founder said during his speech at the Singapore Management University (SMU) commencement opening ceremony last Tuesday (July 30) that the success of his gaming hardware firm was not his own work, but the work of the people he was lucky enough to meet along the way.\n\nAddressing the class of 2019 at the SMU campus, Tan said: \u201cThe people that you will meet at work will dictate if you will be successful in life.\n\n\u201cIf you hang out with negative, toxic people at work who aren\u2019t committed to doing well, you\u2019re destined for failure. Conversely, if you\u2019re lucky enough to meet smart, driven people who want to do well for themselves, for the people they work with, and for the organisations that they work for, you\u2019re more likely to succeed in life.\u201d\n\nHe also reminded graduands not to focus on the wrong things at the start of their career. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasise how important this is, especially for your first job \u2013 that it isn\u2019t the salary that you\u2019re gonna get or the title that you will have. But it\u2019s the people that you work with, work for, and the culture that you\u2019ll be working in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe people that one meets along the course of their work are among the three important groups of people Tan said one will meet in life. The other two groups are family and people \u201cyou will spend your life giving back to\u201d.\n\n\u201cFamily are the people that you take the most from and owe the most to\u201d\n\nTan started his speech by telling the students about his parents, whom he described as \u201cthe single most important people in my life\u201d.\n\nHis father is a \u201cwell-educated, stern, quiet man who came from humble beginnings\u201d, while his mother was \u201cthe daughter of a school watchman\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cWhile my parents had so little to go through life themselves, they wanted only the best for their children, but expected nothing, except for us to do well\u201d, he added.\n\nThe 41-year-old recalled that he was far from a model student in his younger days. \u201cClearly, I was playing games and doing everything that wasn\u2019t necessarily in line with what the school wanted me to do,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was also cutting classes and while he did well in his favourite subjects, he remembers failing just about everything else.\n\n\u201cI caused [my parents] a lot of grief, especially my mother, and till this day I regret every single time I let her down,\u201d he said.\n\nTan had only S$4,000 in savings when he founded Razer. Lianhe Zaobao\n\nFrom his father, he saw and learnt about hard work, attention to detail and responsibility, while his mother taught him to \u201cjust go get what you [want] out of life.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Tan found a job at a law firm, \u201cbut at the back of my mind, my mother\u2019s voice would always be there saying \u2018you can do whatever you want, just go do it.'\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering how his parents reacted when he quit his lawyer job to found his own start-up, he says: \u201cTruth be told, I never really told them. I just conveniently forgot to tell them that I quit being a lawyer and founded Razer with just about S$4,000 in savings.\u201d\n\nHe figures they eventually learned he was no longer a lawyer when they noticed he was wearing a black t-shirt and jeans to work. \u201cBut they never said a thing about it, except my mother, who\u2019d occasionally asked if I was taking care of my health,\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cThe thing I learnt about family is that what they say to you is what they think is the best for you. But what is unsaid is that no matter what you do \u2013 whether you take their advice or otherwise \u2013 your family will ultimately support you with any decision that you make,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo I hope that you will learn that your family are the people in your life that you will take the most from and owe the most to,\u201d he said, and told the students to appreciate their families \u201cevery single minute, every single day\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople that you meet at work can fundamentally change your life\u201d\n\nReferring to his own career, the lawyer-turned-techpreneur told students that what they ended up doing may not be what they spent their entire life studying or working toward.\n\n\u201cYour work is going to be a very big part of your life, and as such, it is incredibly important that you commit yourself to doing great work. If you\u2019re lucky, like me, you\u2019ll find your path early on. But if you don\u2019t truly love the work that you do, move on and don\u2019t stop looking forward until you find what you\u2019re truly passionate about,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former lawyer, who founded Razer in 2005, took the company public in Hong Kong in late 2017. Under his leadership, Razer has become one of the most recognisable brands in gaming hardware globally, with a strong fan base among computer gamers. In recent months, the company even made its own toaster (the product of overwhelming fan requests), and on August 4, it unveiled the Razer x NIO ES6 Night Explorer electric car \u2013 a collaboration with China\u2019s Nio. Only 88 units of the car will be made and sold in China, Razer said.\n\nBut he says the success of Razer was the work of the entire team, and not just him.\n\n\u201cIt was really the people I had met in the course of my work. And the people that you will meet at work will dictate if you will be successful in life,\u201d Tan, who has an estimated wealth of S$955 million, said.\n\nHe also named Khaw Kheng Joo, Razer chief operating officer, as \u201cone of the people that I respect most in my life\u201d. Tan described Khaw as his mentor, friend and a person with \u201cabsolutely no personal ego at all\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe always puts the interest of the company and the people around him first,\u201d Tan said.\n\nKhaw was formerly CEO of MediaRing. The Business Times\n\nHe told a story of how he approached Khaw, former MediaRing CEO, to be CEO of Razer but Khaw chose to be COO instead. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an issue of money, title or prestige for him. He just felt he could contribute the most as COO of a tiny company like ours back then,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly the people that you meet in the course of your work that can fundamentally change your life, Tan said.\n\nHis advice to graduands was: \u201cFind work that you\u2019re truly, truly passionate about, and surround yourself with like-minded people that you want to grow with, learn from and be successful with.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a moral and ethical duty to give back\u201d\n\nReminding graduands that they are only where they are today because of people who have helped make it happen, Tan said: \u201cWhether you know it or not today, you owe a debt to them, and you have a moral and ethical duty to give back\u201d.\n\nThese people could be the school they are from, their community, the country, and even the planet.\n\nTan also encouraged giving back without expecting thanks or recognition.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s more likely that you will not be thanked, honoured or recognised for it and you will just hear negativity and naysayers.\u201d\n\nRead also: Razer\u2019s new SEA HQ is set to open at Singapore\u2019s one-north \u2013 here are 10 of the gaming company\u2019s coolest products\n\nTan then recounted how critics had been unconvinced when he famously tweeted Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong about helping to create a cashless payment system in Singapore.\n\n\u201cBut it didn\u2019t matter to us. What mattered was that this was an opportunity for us as Singaporeans to step up and give back, to do something for Singaporeans by Singaporeans. And it didnt matter for us if succeeded or failed \u2013 at least we would have tried for the county,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, Tan says Razer runs one of the biggest e-money platforms in the region with billions of dollars in payments transacted. Razer Pay is also currently being trialed in Singapore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about being popular, it\u2019s not about being liked. It\u2019s about doing the right thing when you have the opportunity to do so,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLife is short, don\u2019t let the naysayers distract you because in the bigger scheme of things, they don\u2019t matter at all in the work that you will do,\u201d he added.\n\nTan ended his speech by telling the audience about the times he read the book series Choose Your Own Adventure when he was a child. The books would present dilemmas and give him choices to make, but the result was always \u201cgloriously random no matter how much thought I put into it.\u201d\n\nTan said: \u201cLife is just a game, a series of random choices that I have made for the ongoing adventure ahead of me. And today, as you graduate to begin day one, I wish for you a life that is just a game with many random choices for the adventure that is ahead of you.\u201d\n\nWatch his full speech here:\n\nRead also:\n\nYou can soon use Razer Pay at any shop and eatery worldwide \u2013 as long as they accept Visa\n\nAfter Apple, Razer has the world\u2019s best tech support, according to a new ranking\n\nRazer\u2019s third HQ just opened in KL \u2013 and it\u2019s going to be the company\u2019s fintech hub for RazerPay", "description": "Business Insider - When he first started Razer with S$4,000 in his savings, Tan says he \"conveniently forgot\" to tell his parents that he wasn't a lawyer anymore..
