The phrase \u201cI paid as much for my ticket as they did\u201d was aggressively yelled more than once. She was wrong.\n\nIn reality, those people sitting in Premium Economy paid more for their plane tickets for those small luxuries. A lot more.\n\nWhile certainly not as common as the \u201cWhy am I in a middle seat?\u201d argument from Basic Economy flyers, the irate passenger on my flight isn\u2019t alone. This week Conde Nast Traveller broke down the difference between the two fares.\n\nEconomy Plus\n\nEconomy Plus seats are offered by virtually every major airline and get you a few inches of extra legroom. The seats are located toward the front of the aircraft, and passengers in the section are often able to board the plane in an earlier group, get slightly better snacks (think nicer granola bars and bananas), and can drink for free, even on domestic flights.\n\nThe price difference between an Economy Plus tickets and traditional Economy tickets varies depending on your flight but can be anywhere from $US20 to several hundred dollars for international flights.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure if you want the upgrade, you can often upgrade to Economy+ at the gate, sometimes for less cash than if you booked the seat originally, when you check in for your flight, provided there are still seats available.\n\nPremium Economy\n\nPremium Economy is a whole different animal. I personally think that the best way to describe this type of seat is \u201cBusiness\u201d but that\u2019s technically not correct. Premium Economy seats are not as nice as those in First Class or Business, but they\u2019re a step above what you\u2019ll find in Economy.\n\nThe seats are set apart in their own cabin on the plane and offer extra leg and seat room, a bit more recline (although you won\u2019t be able to lay down), and often things like plated meals and amenity kits on longer flights.\n\nSeats in this area are often double the cost that they are in Economy, so you\u2019re going to pay for that comfort. Many airlines have the section set up in a 2-4-2 configuration as well, which means you stand a good chance of ending in a middle seat.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d take an aisle seat in Economy+ over a middle seat in Premium Economy, but if you\u2019re travelling with the person who has the aisle it might be an OK proposition. Regardless, pay attention to what you\u2019re booking and make sure you\u2019re buying a ticket where you think you are.", "description": "If you\u2019re not a frequent flyer, the plethora of seat choices on an aeroplane can be pretty confusing.", "authors": ["Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2017/03/qantas-premium-economy-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
