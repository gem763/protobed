We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight.\n\n\"When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA! I said 'NO, we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in U.S. prisons at tremendous cost. They are yours for trials.'\n\n\"They again said 'No,' thinking, as usual, that the U.S. is always the 'sucker,' on NATO, on Trade, on everything. The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades.\n\n\"I held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\n\n\"Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \"neighborhood.\" They all hate ISIS, have been enemies for years. We are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!\"\n\nUS Marines with Weapons Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment fire 81 mm mortars in Syria in September 2018. US Marine Corps/Cpl. Gabino Perez\n\nThe president's decision was made without warning, and has left allies at home and abroad reeling. Even Pentagon officials reportedly received no warning of the decision.\n\nKurdish forces in northern Syria have fought alongside the US-led coalition to defeat ISIS since 2015. But Turkey considers Kurdish forces to be terrorists, and the US withdrawal paved the way for Turkey to attack them.\n\nThe White House said that Trump endorsed Turkey's planned military operation in the region, with Trump having reportedly arrived at the decision after speaking to Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, by phone on Sunday.\n\nTrump suddenly announced in December 2018 that he was withdrawing US forces from Syria, but scaled back the decision following opposition from military, intelligence, and administration officials and allies in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nRead more: Inside the Syrian camp that is a 'ticking time bomb' for another wave of ISIS violence\n\nHowever Turkey was reportedly unhappy with confidence building measures launched to resolve tensions between Turkey and Kurdish forces, and declared its intention to sweep into the region.\n\nSen.
