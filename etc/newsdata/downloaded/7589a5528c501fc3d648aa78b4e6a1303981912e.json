Flintstones to a bird-watcher's paradise, Kevin McCloud has revealed five homes which perfectly blend in with their surroundings for Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) House of the Year award.\n\nIn Grand Designs: House of the Year, which airs tonight on Channel 4, Kevin and his co-presenters, architect Damion Burrows, and design expert Michelle Ogundehin, visit five homes battling it out for a place on the shortlist, all of which have a 'poetic bridge' to nature.\n\nEach week he'll exclusively reveal which houses the RIBA judges have put through to the shortlist, and in the final programme announce the winner of this prestigious prize.\n\nTonight's unique properties include a minimalist concrete home in London, a bird-watchers' paradise on the Isle of Man, and a home styled on the timer houses of the 17th century.\n\nOne minimalist concrete home in London is one of five homes which features on Grand Designs: House of the Year, which airs tonight at 9pm on Channel 4\n\nMeanwhile Hampshire House was created with local materials, and is built into the landscape in the countryside, with several tranquil 'pavilions' making one huge mansion\n\nMeanwhile the Restorative Rural Retreat for Sartfell on the Isle of Man is a birdwatcher's paradise, and was built using stones retrieved from the local lake\n\nThe Black Rock house on the Isle of Skye was built into a hollow of a cliff face on a lake, with the couple admitting they spent their full contingency budget on the first day of the build\n\nMeanwhile the Black Timber House in London was inspired by 17th and 18th century properties which may have sat on the land at the time\n\nBirdwatcher's paradise\n\nThe Restorative Rural retreat is built into the hillside on the Isle of Man, and features a long thin window running around the property in the middle of the wall, reminiscent of a bird hide.\n\nIts owners are nature-loving retirees Peter and Carol, who ended up building the paradise as an extension to their own home.\n\nIt's at the heart of a nature reserve, with the couple saying they felt 'very proud' of the 'discreet' house.\n\nThe home, which was created from local stone from a lake on the site, should 'fit in with the land as if it's been there for 100 years.'\n\nThe stunning kitchen living area in the Restorative Rural Retreat features a huge horizontal window running around the property from which the nature-loving owners watch the birds\n\nThe Restorative Rural Retreat in the Isle of Man is cleverly built into the landscape with a huge horizontal window, giving it the illusion of being a bird watcher's hide\n\nThe thick concrete walls provide a sheltered and embracing experience on the inside.\n\nThe house is designed to be invisible to passersby from the outside, with the roof covered with grass so that it's not visible from the raised road nearby.\n\nA staircase library packed full of Peter's collection of natural history books connects each floor, with a huge open- plan kitchen and living area featuring a huge ribbon horizontal window giving a panorama landscape perfect for bird-watching.\n\nCarol said: 'We were after a little bit of peace and quiet.'\n\nHomeowners Peter and Linda built their home from locally sourced materials, and said they loved the home for it's 'peace and quiet'\n\nThe house, which took two years to build, is described by Kevin as 'having everything the soul, mind and body could need, with beauty and tranquility'.\n\nPeter said: 'Building on the Isle of Man can be very expensive as a lot of things do have to come from overseas, for example, we couldn't get concrete for a long time.'\n\nThey said they wanted to build a home that would 'stand the test of time' but also 'age gracefully with the landscape'.\n\nMinimalist concrete home\n\nMeanwhile Earl's Court House was strangely inspired by Fred Flintstone, with it's 'very heavy' concrete structure, and stunning glass walls\n\nSet in the Kensington district and located in a conservation area, Earl's Court House occupies a small plot between Georgian terraces, previously housing two garages.\n\nPlanning constraints limited the development height to one storey above the ground, so the approach taken was to maximise the footprint of the building within the site's boundaries and introduce a lower ground storey.\n\nKevin McCloud calls it an 'architectural tiger', as it is 'discreet, clever and beautiful', ducked down low and peaks it's glass head just above the head.\n\nSophie said: 'When I started designing Earl's Court House, the aim was to maximise the potential of the very small size.'\n\nMinimalist Sophie admits she 'doesn't want a flashy house' and doesn't have many possessions in the modernist home in Kensington\n\nShe added: 'How do we get something that feels very comfortable, and looks very settled in the street, but uses every centimeter.'\n\nThe RIBA judges were wooed by Earl's Court House, admitting the simple use of concrete and delicate insertion of the modern building into the surroundings impressed them.\n\nKevin suggested the house had been hidden like a 'greenhouse'.\n\nSophie says: 'You don't see it very obviously from the street, and I like that. I don't want a flashy house.'\n\nThe architect and homeowner says she wanted to bring 'basic, human Fred Flintstone aspects' into the home by using 'lumpy' concrete\n\nThe compact kitchen is tucked with the sitting room on the ground floor, while downstairs there are two bedrooms and two bathrooms.\n\nBut despite how subtle the home may seem, Sophie admits that local residents haven't been so receptive to the house.\n\nShe says: 'We once had an egg thrown at it, at the glass. A broken egg on the front. Human beings don't like change...anything new, people are going to object to.'\n\nStepping into the house, Kevin called it 'a modernist tardis' because it appears much larger and fuller of light than it seems from the outside.\n\nThe clever curved concrete staircase in the home leads to a lower-ground floor, where two bedrooms and bathrooms can be found\n\nBut Sophie insisted it wasn't Doctor Who she was inspired by, but rather children's cartoon The Flintstone's.\n\nShe said: 'Fred Flintstone was a man who had a car with stone wheels, and everything was very lumpy, very heavy. We're in a highly technological age. I wanted to bring some basic, human Fred Flintstone aspect.'\n\nSophie made her best effort to make the house as caveman like as she could, saying: 'I said why don't we do the Flintstone tables, and cast them on the columns. It's how Fred Flintstone would have made his table.'\n\nThe concrete was moulded in precisely cut wooden shuttering and dampened to produce an exact replica of the timber.\n\nOne ingenious window even opens up to the outside by drawing downwards, with Sophie saying: 'It's so nice to be close to the tree, in London to be close to greenery it's very rare.'\n\nDown a curvy concrete staircase, there are two bedrooms equally pristine and paired back.\n\nMeanwhile the bedrooms have a similarly chic and modernist style, with few decorations, painted white walls and concrete columns dominating the space\n\nWhen Sophie's children moved out, she downsized to live in the cube, but then her daughter Olympia moved back in with her mother.\n\nShe said: 'The second bedroom was meant to be a home office or a dressing room slash bedroom so she knicked my wardrobes.'\n\nMeanwhile Olympia acknowledges it isn't the easiest house to live in due to it's size, saying: 'It is a small house, we're not stepping on each other's toes at the moment.\n\n'You can't let the house get messy so it controls all your hoarding tendencys and all your messy tendencys.'\n\nKevin went on to call the house 'shy and retiring' and called it 'blazing with modesty'.\n\n\u201817th Century\u2019 timber home\n\nThe Timber house in London was inspired by homes which may have sat on the sight in the 17th and 18th century, and is built around a stunning courtyard on the site\n\nHidden away in a sea of hidden of paved streets in London, Jonathan and Catherine built a stained black Timber home which was typical of houses around the area at the time.\n\nThe couple actually have a photograph of a similar house to theirs from 1890 in order to contextualize their home.\n\nThe RIBA judges praised the house as a 'wonderful family home that improves the place it's in' and 'conjures memories of what was once there.\n\nThe ground floor is built around a courtyard garden, with the home featuring three bedrooms for the couple's young family.\n\nDespite it's seemingly traditional exterior, the interior of the property features a stunning modern finish, with striking and clever features\n\nKevin McCloud compared the home to a 'little Eden', although the couple said they had faced their fair share of headaches around the project\n\nThe building\u2019s layout capitalises on the irregularly shaped site through an ingenious arrangement of rectilinear spaces for the bedrooms and bathrooms.\n\nThese are united by irregular living space arranged around a courtyard.\n\nGlazing from this space provides a point of reference as you move through the house, and maximises the stunning views beyond the brick wall to St Paul\u2019s.\n\nThe use of exposed timber, particularly in the top-lit living space, creates a warm, welcoming, unique family home. But while the outside may take inspiration from the past, the inside is strikingly modern.\n\nKevin McCloud went on to call it 'a little Eden', before noting how 'lush' the courtyard garden had become.\n\nBut the couple had plenty of headaches when building the home, as it was built directly on top of a public sewer.\n\nJonathan explained: 'We were required to get a special permit to build over it and design foundations specifically.'\n\nFlint family house for three generations\n\nThe Hampshire House was created out of a natural palette of materials, with large windows maximising the stunning views of the local scenery\n\nNeil and Joanna designed the stunning flint house in Hampshire, with the property being called 'almost medieval' on the programme.\n\nThe warm, natural palette of materials, crisp detailing and considered form and arrangement, not only maximise the stunning views of the surrounding scenery, but also pay homage to family life and growth.\n\nThe house is arranged in a series of staggered pavilions, that read as generational steps in a person\u2019s journey through life.\n\nThe pavilions, designed to accompany various members of the family, from childhood to later life, are arranged with the central \u201cparent\u2019s pavilion\u201d containing a double-height, courtyard kitchen.\n\nThe mansion is comprised of three 'pavilions', separating each space by it's needs, including a large living area and a double-height swimming pool\n\nThe courtyard kitchen provides orientation to the home and can be looked down upon from the first-floor corridor connecting the \u201cchildren\u2019s pavilion\u201d, \u201cparents pavilion\u201d and \u201cgrandparents pavilion\u201d and forms a visual connection with the hub-bub of family life.\n\nThis careful arrangement breathes life into the household and creates a familial focal point for the generations to gather.\n\nThe riverside setting informs the design and choice of materials both internally and externally.\n\nCoursed flint, Purbeck stone, architectural cast stone, and untreated oak timber framed windows, which will steadily weather to a silver-grey to complement the tone of the flint and stone, all play their part in the construction of an effortlessly exquisite elevation.\n\nThe double height kitchen in the centre of the home was compared to a 'chapel', with an enormous vaulted ceiling and stunning oak finish\n\nThe almost entirely oak lined bedrooms, with spectacular vistas of the fluvial landscape, emit a sense of stillness, as the biophilic elements enhance the well-being of those inhabiting the space.\n\nBut it's not just the material that makes the house part of the setting - it's literally dug into the hill.\n\nWith a double height kitchen, swimming pool, granny flat and family block, the house is perfectly designed to act as a modern mansion family home.\n\nKevin called it a 'stone fortress' from the outside, while it was also suggested it was like a chapel on the programme due it's high ceiling.\n\nBy tapering the columns of the house out to a fine point, they allow light to flood into the rooms and don't obstruct the view of the landscape.\n\nBlack rock home\n\nMeanwhile the Black Rock home on the Isle of Skye is built into a hollow of rock by the side of a lake, and sits perfectly into the landscape\n\nThe house, which is built into a natural hollow in the rock on the Isle of Skye, offers a dramatic view of the sea, canter levered out over the rocky shore.\n\nThe owners, Julian and Delia, first visited Skye over thirty years ago and have been coming back ever since.\n\nThey said it just 'felt magical' the moment they went there, and when they retired from London opted to live in Skye.\n\nSuspended above the waters, the interiors are all surreal and minimalist, following the shape of the rocky shore.\n\nThe main living area looks out over a stunning lake, with homeowner Julian admitting the view was 'the focus point of the house'\n\nJulian called the view 'astonishing', admitting: 'The view is the point of the house.'\n\nMeanwhile Delia said it was 'wonderful' when there was a storm going on outside.\n\nDespite that, the build was not straight forward due to to the heavy weather.\n\nBuilder Frankie Wallace said: 'The boys were getting saturated. A few times we had to replace the insulation as that would get soaked through.'\n\nThe clever minimalist architecture was a challenge to build, as the couple faced rough weather and troubles with their budget as they tried to finish the home\n\nThe couple also admitted they spent their full contingency budget on the first day of the build, as ti was significantly more expensive than they had predicted to build.\n\nIt cost over \u00a350,000 toward breaking up rock on the site on the first day.\n\nJulian now said he had 'repressed' all the difficulties, and joked he didn't wake up 'screaming in the middle of the night' thinking about it.\n\nThey said they were able to finish the project as Julian's father passed away, leaving them just enough money to finish it.\n\n\n\nGrand Designs airs tonight on Channel 4 at 9pm", "description": "Kevin McCloud is set to reveal five homes which 'imaginatively' respond to their landscapes on Grand Designs: House of the Year tonight, including a bird-watching paradise and a minimalist home.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20386110-0-image-a-45_1572452923075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
