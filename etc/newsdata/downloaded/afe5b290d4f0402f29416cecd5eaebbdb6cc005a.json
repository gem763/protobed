But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d he added.\n\n\u2026Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nThe survey comes as House Democrats are attempting to move swiftly with an impeachment inquiry against President Trump that was launched in the wake of a partisan CIA officer\u2019s so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint claiming the president pressure the leader of Ukraine to look into allegations of corruption against former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Both presidents have denied any pressure was applied to probe Biden, and in a nod to transparency, the White House publically released a transcript of the world leaders\u2019 July 25th conversation to show no wrongdoing occurred.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Thursday comments are not the first time he has taken aim at Fox News. In late August, the president ripped the news network for allowing Democrats to push their talking points unchallenged.\n\n\u201cThe New Fox News is letting millions of GREAT people down!\u201d the president tweeted at the time. \u201cWe have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust watched Fox News heavily promoting the Democrats through their DNC Communications Director, spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor, Sandra Smith,\u201d he added.", "description": "Trump blasted Fox News over its poll that found a record 51 percent of voters believe he should be impeached and removed from office.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Trump-Bearing-Down.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
