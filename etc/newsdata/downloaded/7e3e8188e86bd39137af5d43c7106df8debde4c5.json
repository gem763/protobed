But heavy-handed regulations yielding negligible climate benefits threaten the United States\u2019 ability to produce affordable energy. The Obama administration\u2019s methane regulations were a costly, non-solution in search of a problem.\n\nEnergy producers have an incentive to capture and sell methane, the main component in natural gas, because it has economic value\u2014yielding low cost energy for consumers and reducing the United States\u2019 allies dependence on Russian gas. The EPA even notes methane emissions from the industry have fallen despite the fact energy production has skyrocketed. Furthermore, states have implemented their own rules and the private sector is taking voluntary action to capture methane. As noted in Heritage\u2019s Blueprint For Balance, the previous administration\u2019s climate regulations were burdensome, duplicative, and unnecessary; the current EPA is wise to right size them.", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014Heritage energy and environmental economist\u00a0Nick Loris said the following on the EPA\u2019s decision to undo the Obama administration\u2019s methane regulations:", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
