In fact the combination proved decidedly traumatic in the first episode, \u2018Antarctica.\u2019\n\nMother Nature was certainly not very\u2026 maternal and some parents almost as harsh as the conditions of minus 40 degrees and winds of 70mph.\n\nDifference: Sir David Attenborough and Mother Nature are two of the most revered and righteous things that we still have in our lives. But it didn\u2019t feel like it in Seven Worlds, One Planet\n\nAs for the Mighty Attenborough, he put us through the wringer, with several sequences that even by his standards were torture.\n\nHe came over like a man who, at 93, was running out of time and had decided not let us off so lightly in this series: to punish us for our ecological/environmental sins; for not listening to him sooner; to try and finally get through to us.\n\nHis victims were the usual suspects - the mothers and their young, particularly his favourite prey: baby penguins.\n\nBut he then set a new Personal Best for making us suffer with a different species: an albatross chick.\n\nFamiliar: His subjects were the usual suspects - the mothers and their young, particularly his favourite prey: baby penguins\n\nSeven Worlds, One Planet\u2019s typically stunning opener could be summarized, and symbolized, by a single sentence. Three familiar words we probably thought we\u2019d never hear again.\n\n\u2018Winter is coming!\u2019 Sir David Attenborough declared thrillingly in \u2018Antarctica\u2019, effectively bringing the legendary motto back from extinction (appropriately). Even making it better - given that his voice would add drama, poetry, and gravitas to any statement.\n\nPlus there was the fact that this time, the world\u2019s favorite forbidding maxim was real. All too real in today\u2019s climate of, um, climate change.\n\nWinter really was coming in Antarctica. Relentlessly\u2026\n\nMoving: But he then set a new Personal Best for making us suffer with a different species: an albatross chick\n\n\u2018Winter is coming\u2019 fitted as a summarization/symbolization of \u2018Antarctica\u2019 for more than just the weather.\n\nAttenborough\u2019s study of the continent (number 1 of the 7) had enough stunning landscapes, epic heroism, family tragedy, ancient rivalries, thunderous sea battles (penguins against leopard seals and even orca whales), strange sex (between hermaphrodites), horrible brutality and bleakness to make Game Of Thrones look like Harry and Meghan: an African Journey.\n\nLike GoT, with Attenborough you never knew where the danger came from: who\u2019d be attacking who and who\u2019d survive.\n\nThe horror was the price we had to pay \u2013 for the beauty of scenes showing the anemones and jellyfish, but above the damage we had done to the creatures in their sea, their continent, and the planet.\n\nWatch out: Like Game Of Thrones, with Attenborough you never knew where the danger came from: who\u2019d be attacking who and who\u2019d survive\n\nThe penguin\u2019s chances of leaving the colony, collecting food, and avoiding suffering the same fate as the one we saw being crunched in two by a leopard seal were \u2018becoming harder\u2019 Attenborough said \u2013 \u2018because of climate change.\u2019\n\nThe first animal to catch his beady eye though - like a kind of predator\u2019s starter \u2013 was a Weddel seal and her pup.\n\nEven its birth was traumatic \u2013 for it and us: like a slippery alien, flopping from the warmth of the womb on to the ice was \u2018the sharpest drop in temperature any animal ever faces.\u2019\n\nThe super-cute pup \u2013 like a furry white hot water bottle cover \u2013 couldn\u2019t swim for the first week of its life.\n\nEmotional: The horror was the price we had to pay \u2013 for the beauty of scenes showing the anemones and jellyfish...\n\n... but above the damage we had done to the creatures in their sea, their continent, and the planet\n\n\u2018It\u2019s trapped here out on the ice,\u2019 Attenborough stated simply, immediately setting alarm bells ringing for viewers of his previous series.\n\nSure enough, with a blizzard raging for days, the mother and her baby became encrusted with snow as they were battered by the howling gale and temperatures of minus 40 degrees.\n\n\u2018She now faces the harshest of decisions,\u2019 explained Attenborough (coldly). \u2018Does she stay with her pup? Or shelter in the water?\u2019\n\nThe fact he asked the question meant it was rhetorical.\n\nAttenborough didn\u2019t even answer it. The next (horrible) shot showed a vast expanse of white with one black dot: the baby seal, left to tough it out: a sitting duck.\n\nWhen we returned the storm was over and the sun out.\n\nPerilous journey: The penguin\u2019s chances of leaving the colony, collecting food, and avoiding death were \u2018becoming harder\u2019 Attenborough said \u2013 \u2018because of climate change'\n\n\u2018Some pups didn\u2019t make it,\u2019 Attenborough said somewhat gratuitously.\n\nMiraculously ours had though. When the mother popped her head out of the water it\u2019s safe to say her pup was pleased to see her.\n\nAt the same time, you suspected, it was thinking: \u2018yeah thanks a lot mum! I won\u2019t forget that.\u2019\n\nIt was the sort of tough love/self-preservation Cersei and most of the mothers or parents would be proud of.\n\nAs for Attenborough himself, you wondered who would be his GoT character?\n\nConfrontation: The first animal to catch his beady eye though - like a kind of predator\u2019s starter \u2013 was a Weddel seal and her pup\n\nHe\u2019s such a learned, principled, educator you might think the Archmaester at the Citadel although the Three-Eyed Raven does him more justice - because he knows everything about the past, present and future.\n\nAttenborough\u2019s story of the baby albatross even had echoes of a young Bran Stark climbing the tower in Game Of Thrones\u2019 very first episode.\n\nBut, as I\u2019ve suggested before, we forget Attenborough is a master of manipulation and propaganda: a wily, conniving, like a saintly version of Littlefinger. He\u2019s not beyond making us suffer.\n\nCute: The four-week old Grey-Headed Albatross chick was so adorable Pixar couldn\u2019t have made it any cuter and was \u2018the only chick they will have in two years\u2019, Attenborough explained\n\nThe chick\u2019s ordeal saw him use his full repertoire of torture devices namely:\n\n1. Giving simple facts a sinister resonance\n\nThe four-week old Grey-Headed Albatross chick was so adorable Pixar couldn\u2019t have made it any cuter and was \u2018the only chick they will have in two years\u2019, Attenborough explained.\n\n\u2018So far it has been sheltered from the gales by its parents who take turns to collect food for it out at sea.\u2019\n\nWe noted the key words: \u2018so far\u2026\u2019\n\n2. Anything seemingly sweet or positive is often actually ominous\n\nThe parents used \u2018a delicate touching of beaks\u2019 to \u2018strengthen their bond\u2019 with the chick, Attenborough said, adding: \u2018but these tender moments cannot last forever.\u2019\n\nNot in a David Attenborough series, no.\n\nContact: The parents used \u2018a delicate touching of beaks\u2019 to \u2018strengthen their bond\u2019 with the chick, Attenborough said, adding: \u2018but these tender moments cannot last forever'\n\n3. The torture slowly began to twist\n\n\u2018As the chicks grows so does its appetite,\u2019 Attenborough told us, which meant \u2018one parent now has to leave before the other returns.\u2019\n\nWe immediately feared the worst as he confirmed: \u2018for the first time in its life this chick is alone.\u2019\n\n4. You never know where the danger (from Attenborough) lies\n\nOver the years we\u2019ve seen sea creatures like seal cubs and baby penguins succumb to various cunning, menacing, predators but rarely anything as basic, if effective (fatal), as the one here: the wind.\n\nThe way Attenborough struck was genius in its simplicity: through a kind of weather report.\n\n\u2018The Antarctic is the windiest continent,\u2019 he informed us helpfully. \u2018And in recent years climate change has bought storms that are more frequent and more powerful: 70mph. The albatross chicks must try to stay on their nests.\u2019\n\nAgain the word \u2018try.\u2019\n\nWe saw the white ball of fur perilously hanging over the edge of the nest: literally clinging on for dear life.\n\nSad: We immediately feared the worst as he later confirmed, \u2018for the first time in its life this chick is alone'\n\n5. Attenborough often uses few words to lethal effect but his silence even more\n\nThe way the camera then cut to a huge crash of waves and a few white feathers on the grass, then panned up the albatross\u2019 empty nest told us everything \u2013 as well as being gratuitously grim.\n\n6. Just when you think things couldn\u2019t get any worse, they do\n\nThe next shot turned your stomach. Or like a punch to the stomach: the chick on its back - wet and dirty -looking up at camera, its pink legs twisted and one wing sticking out as it was broken, writhing slowly.\n\n7. Then when we\u2019re down, Attenborough delivers another ruthless blow\n\n\u201cSurviving the storm is one thing. But now - off the nest, in these freezing temperatures - this chick has just hours to live.\u2019\n\nDevastating: The next shot turned your stomach. Or like a punch to the stomach: the chick on its back - wet and dirty -looking up at camera, its pink legs twisted and one wing sticking out as it was broken, writhing slowly\n\n8. Switching tack to more general points can also just be painful\n\nAttenborough seemed to have moved on when he switched tack to a general point about climate change. \u2018The albatross population here has more than halved in the last 15 years,\u2019 he said gravely, making you feel we were personally to blame. \u2018They are facing extinction. They simply cannot keep pace with the changes affecting their world.\u2019\n\nTo illustrate this of course he had an example: another baby albatross hanging off its nest \u2013 this time motionless.\n\n\u2018Some chicks have already succumbed to exposure,\u2019 he said. Again, when you thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse, it did \u2013 with the parent returning and trying to revive it (to give it the food it had gone for).\n\n\u2018The bond is so strong it can be hard for a father to let go,\u2019 Attenborough said with brutal understatement.\n\n9. When you think it\u2019s over it isn\u2019t\n\nNow the original chick\u2019s parent was back too \u2013 with a huge close-up of its eyes showing its confusion.\n\n\u2018Something is not right,\u2019 Attenborough said, against with masterly understatement. \u2018The nest should not be empty.\u2019\n\nA change of subject: Attenborough seemed to have moved on when he switched tack to a general point about climate change\n\n10. Any signs of hope can still be bad\n\nThe chick lay on its back, struggling to right itself, and finally succeeding - and calling its parents with horribly plaintive cheeping noises.\n\n\u2018The chick is actually right below its parent,\u2019 said Attenborough \u2013 which sounded good, until he added: \u2018But - because it\u2019s not on the nest - the parent doesn\u2019t recognize it.\u2019\n\nFollowed by the killer line: \u2018and doesn\u2019t help it.\u2019\n\n11. Hope is then extinguished\n\nAs they chick HAULED itself up the mountain that was the small structure presumably designed to make it safer, the parent looked down \u2013 which again could only be good and an end to its/our trauma. Until Attenborough informed us: \u2018Albatrosses do not recognize their chicks by sight, sound, or smell. They identify them by finding them on the nest. If it is to survive the chick will have to get back on the best by itself.\u2019\n\n12. Things could still get worse\n\nJust as it appeared to have done just this, the chick tumbled down \u2013 back to where it started.\n\nGripping: Seven Worlds, One Planet was compulsive Sunday night viewing\n\n13. His knowledge that nature though is invariably amazing\n\nWith a Herculean effort, like the Bruce Willis of albatrosses/the Antarctic, the tiny, fluffy, white ball of fluff dragged itself over the rim and flopped at its parent\u2019s feet.\n\n\u2018The chick has made it!\u2019 Attenborough cheered, as if he was just as ecstatic as we were. \u2018The bond is re-established immediately and the parent once again provides the warmth the chick so desperately needs.\u2019\n\nWe were so relieved we didn\u2019t consider that Attenborough had known it would survive all along and made us suffer for no reason other than the fact he probably thought it was OUR FAULT.\n\n14. Even happy endings aren\u2019t necessarily really happy\n\nEven when it was over, we weren\u2019t off the hook. Attenborough needed only four words to twist the knife with his punch-line about the baby albatross.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s safe. For now...\u2019\n\n18 of the best facts from \u2018Antarctica'\n\n1. 200 million years ago our planet was entirely covered by sea (with no continents)\n\n2. Antarctica is one and half times the size of the United States\n\n3. 98% of Antarctica is covered in ice\n\n4. Only one mammal can live this far South: the Weddel seal\n\n5. King Penguins and their babies recognize each other by their calls (not sight) but need to be within a 15 metres radius\n\n6. Sea leopards can be 3 metres long, weigh 4 tons and have blubber 15cms thick\n\n7. The combined weight of the 400 trillion krill in Antarctica is greater than any other species on the planet\n\n8. Gentoo penguins travel 50 miles to find food\n\nfor their chicks\n\n9. They are the fastest penguins, capable of swimming\n\nat 22 mph\n\n10. Orca whales eat penguins, hunting them in packs\n\n11. Every day 40, 000 miles of sea in Antarctica freezes over.\n\n12. By the end of winter the continent doubles in size\n\n13. Sea anemones are animals not plants\n\n14. Sea anemones eat jellyfish\n\n15. The largest mammal ever recorded \u2013 a blue whale 33 metres long and perhaps 100 years old \u2013 was butchered in a whaling station in South Georgia in just 2 hours\n\n16. Right whales were so trusting and inquisitive they swam right up to the whalers\u2019 boats. In a few decades, out of 35, 000 population, only 35 females survived\n\n17. Since the 1986 ban on killing the population of Right whales has now grown to 2000.\n\n18.
