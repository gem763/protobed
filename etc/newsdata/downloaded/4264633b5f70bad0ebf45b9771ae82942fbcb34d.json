The program, also known as \"Remain in Mexico,\" has come under widespread criticism for failing to protect migrants with legitimate fears of returning to their homeland.\n\nMcAleenan said the end of \"catch and release\" is a reaction, in part, to the record number of 144,000 migrants apprehended or encountered at the southern border in May. He said that 72% were unaccompanied children or families.\n\nThe announcement follows an agreement signed last week by El Salvador and the U.S. in which the Central American nation agreed to allow some asylum-seekers to request protection there rather than the U.S. The operational details of that deal were not disclosed.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court, by a vote of 7-2, allowed the administration to implement a rule requiring migrants to first seek asylum in \"a third country.\" In other words, the country through which they traveled to get to the United States.", "description": "The move is the latest by the Trump administration to curb the flow of migrants seeking asylum at the southern border.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/23/ap_19266642000858_wide-fe4728c335961b0ee7043af06c366bcd317d2b06.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
