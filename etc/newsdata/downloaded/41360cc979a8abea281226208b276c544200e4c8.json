It started this morning when President Trump used the word in a tweet about impeachment:\n\nSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching. But we will WIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nThat set off a flurry of condemnations from the left and even Sen. Mitch McConnell called the remark unfortunate:\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell: \"Given the history in our country, I would not compare this to a lynching. That was an unfortunate choice of words. It is an unfair process, and a better way to characterize it would be to call it an unfair process.\" pic.twitter.com/BurfcNSIhl \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) October 22, 2019\n\nOne of the people who was quick to attack Trump was former Vice President Biden who called the comparison \u201cdespicable.\u201d\n\nImpeachment is not \"lynching,\" it is part of our Constitution. Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable. https://t.co/QcC25vhNeb \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 22, 2019\n\nBiden (or whoever is running his Twitter account) should have checked the record. This afternoon, CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski dug up this old appearance in which Biden tells Wolf Blitzer, \u201cEven if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was, in fact, something that met the standard, the very high bar that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nWhile Biden has called Trump\u2019s lynching comments \u201cabhorrent\u201d and \u201cdespicable,\u201d in 1998 appearance on CNN, Biden said impeachment could end up being viewed as a \u201cpartisan lynching.\u201d https://t.co/4jGo8hSQSZhttps://t.co/6p210g7M6l pic.twitter.com/UkJiXLsHOG \u2014 andrew kaczynski\ud83e\udd14 (@KFILE) October 22, 2019\n\nAwkward! But Biden is far from the only Democrat who made that comparison 20 years ago. Tom Elliott put together this supercut to highlight several more examples.\n\nSUPERCUT: Democrats are super consistent on the topic of using the word \u201clynching\u201d in reference to an impeachment pic.twitter.com/qT0QHAUwpf \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 23, 2019\n\nOne of the people in that clip above is Rep. Gregory Meeks. Back then, Meeks said, \u201cWhat we are doing here is not a prosecution, it is a persecution and, indeed, it is a political lynching.\u201d This afternoon Meeks appeared on CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper show where he was asked about having used the term in connection to impeachment in the past. You can see Rep. Meeks\u2019 full response below.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump does not have the liberty to say and use that word,\u201d says Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks of Pres. Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201clynching\u201d to describe the Democratic impeachment process. https://t.co/V1479vyQrD pic.twitter.com/Sc9ae2kDfe \u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) October 23, 2019\n\nIn short: Only black Democrats can weaponize this particular term in a political context. But even if you buy Meeks\u2019 claim that it\u2019s okay for him to talk about impeachment as lynching because of his family history, what about Joe Biden and Jim McDermott. I guess this is just another case where it\u2019s different when Democrats do it.", "description": "\"...to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Biden-lynching.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
