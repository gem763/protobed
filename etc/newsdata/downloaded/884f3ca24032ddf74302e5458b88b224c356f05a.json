Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).\n\nThat made it the bloodiest period in the world\u2019s longest-running war since UNAMA began collecting like-for-like figures in 2009. It brought the total of casualties for the first nine months of 2019 to over 8,000.\n\n\u201cCivilian casualties at record-high levels clearly show the need for all parties concerned to pay much more attention to protecting the civilian population, including through a review of conduct during combat operations,\u201d said Tadamichi Yamamoto, one of the U.N.\u2019s top officials in Afghanistan.\n\nTaliban insurgents fighting the U.S.-backed Kabul government control more of Afghanistan than at any time since being ousted from power nearly two decades ago.\n\nThey have stepped up a campaign of suicide bombings in recent years as Washington tries to pull its forces out.\n\nAround 62 percent of casualties were caused by what UNAMA called \u201canti-government elements\u201d, though casualties caused by pro-government forces also rose 26 percent.\n\nUNAMA said on Tuesday that 85 civilians had been killed and more than 370 wounded in violence linked to last month\u2019s election.\n\nThe two presidential front-runners have both already claimed victory despite the count being delayed.", "description": "A record 4,313 civilians were injured or killed in Afghanistan's war against the Islamist Taliban between July and September, the United Nations said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Abdul Qadir Sediqi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
