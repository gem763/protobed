We can only eliminate plastic waste by acting fast and taking radical action at all points in the plastic cycle.\n\n\u201cOur starting point has to be design, reducing the amount of plastic we use, and then making sure that what we do use increasingly comes from recycled sources.\n\n\u201cWe are also committed to ensuring all our plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable.\u201d\n\nPaula Chin, sustainable materials specialist at WWF UK, said: \u201cUnilever\u2019s ambition to slash their plastic usage and to process more plastic than it sells is a welcome step.\n\n\u201cWe need to see more businesses, producers and governments all taking greater responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe natural world isn\u2019t a luxury \u2013 it is our life support system, and we must act now to protect it, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d", "description": "The consumer giant said it will cut more than 100,000 tonnes of plastic packaging out of its supply chain.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/10/wire-19387690-1570440249-855_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
