USA TODAY\n\nBrock Osweiler is closing the door on finding a spot in the NFL in 2019 \u2060\u2014 and beyond.\n\nThe seven-year veteran quarterback told KUSA's Mike Klis on Wednesday that he was retiring from the league.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely grateful for the time I did receive playing in the National Football League,\u2019\u2019 Osweiler told Klis. \u201cThe experiences I did have, people I did meet, relationships I did make -- I\u2019m not going to dwell on the things that didn\u2019t happen in my career.\"\n\nAt 6-7 and 240 pounds, Osweiler stood out ever since he arrived in the NFL as a second-round pick by the Denver Broncos out of Arizona State in 2012. But the peak of his NFL fame wouldn't arrive until 2015, when he took over for an injured Peyton Manning and led the Broncos to a 5-2 record as a starter before the five-time NFL MVP reclaimed his role in time for the playoffs.\n\nThe Broncos then went on to win Super Bowl 50 against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nSpurning the Broncos the ensuing offseason after Manning's retirement, Osweiler instead signed with the Houston Texans on a four-year, $72 million deal. But after he threw 15 touchdowns with 16 interceptions in 2016, Houston traded Osweiler to the Cleveland Browns, parting with a second-round pick just to get him off their books.\n\nOsweiler was subsequently released by the Browns and later served as a backup for the Broncos in the 2017 season. He also was a backup for the Miami Dolphins in 2018 and remained a free agent into the 2019 campaign.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
