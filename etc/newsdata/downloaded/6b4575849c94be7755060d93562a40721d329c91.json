We\u2019re very conscious of the opposition, they\u2019re a much improved opposition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get a balance of opportunity, workload and also being ready to win the games. That is the number one priority after all.\u201d\n\nKurtley Beale remains at fullback with teenager Jordan Petaia, who scored a try on his test debut against Uruguay, swapping wings and Marika Koroibete coming back into the side.\n\nSamu Kerevi also returns in the centres with James O\u2019Connor, who has recovered from the corked leg that prevented him from playing against Uruguay.\n\nKerevi was penalised for leading with his forearm into a tackle in the Wales match but said he would not be altering his running style.\n\nWinger Reece Hodge is serving the last match of his three-game ban for a high tackle in Australia\u2019s opening victory over Fiji\n\nCheika said addressing the number of penalties Australia were incurring in the tackle was a major priority this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re addressing that, we\u2019ve got some ideas about how we are going to get better,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s truth or perception, we\u2019re getting the arm raised against us and losing players to the bin for things we shouldn\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to lift our standards there, it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nAustralia: 15-Kurtley Beale, 14-Jordan Petaia, 13-James O\u2019Connor, 12-Samu Kerevi, 11-Marika Koroibete, 10-Matt To\u2019omua, 9-Nic White, 8-Isi Naisarani, 7-David Pocock (captain), 6-Jack Dempsey, 5-Rory Arnold, 4-Izack Rodda, 3-Sekope Kepu, 2-Tolu Latu, 1-Scott Sio\n\nReplacements: 16-Jordan Uelese, 17-James Slipper, 18-Taniela Tupou, 19-Adam Coleman, 20-Michael Hooper, 21-Will Genia, 22-Christian Lealiifano, 23-Dane Haylett-Petty.", "description": "Wallabies coach Michael Cheika named his third starting flyhalf of the World Cup on Tuesday, putting Matt To'omua in the number 10 shirt for Australia's final Pool D match against Georgia.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438365321&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970FJ-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
