He married, had a family, and devoted himself utterly to his two little girls. After he got out of the military, he worked as a moderator for Facebook, where he purged the social network of the worst stuff that its users post on a daily basis: the hate speech, the murders, the child pornography.\n\nUtley worked the overnight shift at a Facebook content moderation site in Tampa, FL, operated by a professional services vendor named Cognizant. The 800 or so workers there face relentless pressure from their bosses to better enforce the social network\u2019s community standards, which receive near-daily updates that leave its contractor workforce in a perpetual state of uncertainty. The Tampa site has routinely failed to meet the 98 percent \u201caccuracy\u201d target set by Facebook. In fact, with a score that has been hovering around 92, it is Facebook\u2019s worst-performing site in North America.\n\nKEY FINDINGS Facebook\u2019s content moderation site in Tampa, FL, which is operated by the professional services firm Cognizant, is its lowest-performing site in North America. It has never consistently enforced Facebook\u2019s policies with 98 percent accuracy, as stipulated in Cognizant\u2019s contract.\n\nFor the first time, three former Facebook moderators in North America are breaking their nondisclosure agreements and going on the record to discuss working conditions on the site.\n\nA Facebook content moderator working for Cognizant in Tampa had a heart attack at his desk and died last year. Senior management initially discouraged employees from discussing the incident, for fear it would hurt productivity.\n\nTampa workers have filed two sexual harassment cases against coworkers since April. They are now before the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nFacilities at the Tampa site are often filthy, with workers reporting that the office\u2019s only bathroom has repeatedly been found smeared with feces and menstrual blood.\n\nWorkers have also found pubic hair and fingernails at their desks, along with other bodily waste.\n\nVerbal and physical fights at the office are common. So are reports of theft.\n\nThe Phoenix site has been dealing with an infestation of bed bugs for the past three months.\n\nFacebook says it will conduct an audit of its partner sites and make other changes to promote the well-being of its contractors. It said it would consider making more moderators full-time employees in the future, and hopes to someday provide counseling for moderators after they leave.\n\nThe stress of the job weighed on Utley, according to his former co-workers, who, like all Facebook contractors at the Tampa site, must sign a 14-page nondisclosure agreement.\n\n\u201cThe stress they put on him \u2014 it\u2019s unworldly,\u201d one of Utley\u2019s managers told me. \u201cI did a lot of coaching. I spent some time talking with him about things he was having issues seeing. And he was always worried about getting fired.\u201d\n\nOn the night of March 9th, 2018, Utley slumped over at his desk. Co-workers noticed that he was in distress when he began sliding out of his chair. Two of them began to perform CPR, but no defibrillator was available in the building. A manager called for an ambulance.\n\nThe Cognizant site in Tampa is set back from the main road in an office park, and between the dim nighttime lighting and discreet exterior signage, the ambulance appears to have had trouble finding the building. Paramedics arrived 13 minutes after the first call, one worker told me, and when they did, Utley had already begun to turn blue.\n\nHe left behind a wife, Joni, and two young daughters\n\nParamedics raced Utley to a hospital. At Cognizant, some employees were distraught \u2014 one person told me he passed by one of the site\u2019s designated \u201ctranquility rooms\u201d and found one of his co-workers, a part-time preacher, praying loudly in tongues. Others ignored the commotion entirely, and continued to moderate Facebook posts as the paramedics worked.\n\nUtley was pronounced dead a short while later at the hospital, the victim of a heart attack. Further information about his health history, or the circumstances of his death, could not be learned. He left behind a wife, Joni, and two young daughters. He was 42 years old.\n\nOn Monday morning, workers on the day shift were informed that there had been an incident, and they began collecting money to buy a card and send flowers. But some site leaders did not initially tell workers that Utley had died, and instructed managers not to discuss his death, current and former employees told me.\n\n\u201cEveryone at leadership was telling people he was fine \u2014 \u2018oh, he\u2019ll be okay,\u2019\u201d one co-worker recalled. \u201cThey wanted to play it down. I think they were worried about people quitting with the emotional impact it would have.\u201d\n\nBut the illusion shattered later that day, when Utley\u2019s father, Ralph, came to the site to gather his belongings. He walked into the building and, according to a co-worker I spoke to, said: \u201cMy son died here.\u201d\n\nIn February, I wrote about the secret lives of Facebook contractors in America. Since 2016, when the company came under heavy criticism for failing to prevent various abuses of its platform, Facebook has expanded its workforce of people working on safety and security around the world to 30,000. About half of those are content moderators, and the vast majority are contractors hired through a handful of large professional services firms. In 2017, Facebook began opening content moderation sites in American cities including Phoenix, Austin, and Tampa. The goal was to improve the accuracy of moderation decisions by entrusting them to people more familiar with American culture and slang.\n\nCognizant received a two-year, $200 million contract from Facebook to do the work, according to a former employee familiar with the matter. But in return for policing the boundaries of free expression on one of the internet\u2019s largest platforms, individual contractors in North America make as little as $28,800 a year. They receive two 15-minute breaks and a 30-minute lunch each day, along with nine minutes per day of \u201cwellness\u201d time that they can use when they feel overwhelmed by the emotional toll of the job. After regular exposure to graphic violence and child exploitation, many workers are subsequently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and related conditions.\n\nThree former moderators for Facebook in North America agreed to break their nondisclosure agreements\n\nMy initial report focused on Phoenix, where workers told me that they had begun to embrace fringe views after continuously being exposed to conspiracy theories at work. One brought a gun to work to protect himself against the possibility of a fired employee returning to the office seeking vengeance. Others told me they are haunted by visions of the images and videos they saw during their time on the job.\n\nConditions at the Phoenix site have not improved significantly since I visited. Last week, some employees were sent home after an infestation of bed bugs was discovered in the office \u2014 the second time bed bugs have been found there this year. Employees who contacted me worried that the infestation would spread to their own homes, and said managers told them Cognizant would not pay to clean their homes.\n\n\u201cBed bugs can be found virtually every place people tend to gather, including the workplace,\u201d Cognizant said in a statement. \u201cNo associate at this facility has formally asked the company to treat an infestation in their home. If someone did make such a request, management would work with them to find a solution.\u201d\n\nFacebook executives have maintained that the working conditions described to me by dozens of contractors do not accurately reflect the daily lives of the majority of its workers. But after publishing my story about Phoenix, I received dozens of messages from other contractors around the world, many of whom reported having similar experiences. The largest single group of messages I received came from current and former Facebook contractors in Tampa. Many of them have worked closely with employees at the Phoenix site, and believe working conditions in Florida are even more grim.\n\nIn May, I traveled to Florida to meet with these Facebook contractors. This article is based on interviews with 12 current and former moderators and managers at the Tampa site. In most cases, I agreed to use pseudonyms to protect the employees from potential retaliation from Facebook and Cognizant. But for the first time, three former moderators for Facebook in North America agreed to break their nondisclosure agreements and discuss working conditions at the site on the record.\n\nEmployees told me that pressure from managers to improve its performance has taken a toll on the workforce. Cognizant\u2019s contract with Facebook is coming up for renewal, and with the entire company struggling to hit the 98 percent accuracy target, there are widespread concerns internally that Cognizant will lose Facebook\u2019s business.\n\nContractors told me that Cognizant had lured them away from less demanding jobs by promising regular schedules, bonuses, and career development, only to renege on all three.\n\nThey described a filthy workplace in which they regularly find pubic hair and other bodily waste at their workstations. Employees said managers laugh off or ignore sexual harassment and threats of violence. Two discrimination cases have been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission since April.\n\n\u201cWe were bodies in seats,\u201d one former moderator told me\n\nThey said marijuana use is so prevalent that the site manager jokingly complained at an all-hands meeting that he had gotten a contact high walking in the door.\n\nMore than anything else, the contractors described an environment in which they are never allowed to forget how quickly they can be replaced. It is a place where even Keith Utley, who died working alongside them, would receive no workplace memorial \u2014 only a passing mention during team huddles in the days after he passed. \u201cThere is no indication that this medical condition was work related,\u201d Cognizant told me in a statement. \u201cOur associate\u2019s colleagues, managers and our client were all saddened by this tragic event.\u201d (The client is Facebook.)\n\nUtley\u2019s family could not be reached for comment. Employees who began working after he died told me they had never heard his name.\n\n\u201cWe were bodies in seats,\u201d one former moderator told me. \u201cWe were nothing to them \u2014 at all.\u201d\n\nShawn Speagle was 23 and employed at an online education company working with English language learners when he visited a Cognizant job fair. A recruiter there described to him a role in which Speagle would primarily help businesses analyze engagement on their Facebook pages. He might have to do some content moderation, the recruiter said, but Speagle entered the interview believing he was about to embark on a new career in high technology \u2014 one that he hoped would eventually lead to a full-time role at Facebook.\n\nCognizant offered Speagle $15 an hour to do the job full time \u2014 a marked improvement over his previous job, which was seasonal. Only after he began training did he realize that the job would not, in fact, involve helping businesses with Facebook marketing. Instead, two weeks after Speagle was put onto the production floor, a manager told him he and a colleague would be reviewing graphic violence and hate speech full time.\n\n\u201cFor our associates who opt to work in content moderation, we are transparent about the work they will perform,\u201d a Cognizant spokesman said in response. \u201cThey are made aware of the nature of the role before and during the hiring process, and then given extensive and specific training before working on projects.\u201d\n\nBut had his managers asked, they would have learned that Speagle had a history of anxiety and depression, and that he might not be suited well for the role. No one did.\n\n\u201cThey just said me and [my colleague] were very meticulous and had a lot of promise to move up to the SME position,\u201d Speagle said, referring to the subject matter experts who make $1 more per hour in exchange for answering moderators\u2019 questions about Facebook policy. \u201cThey said Facebook is basically shoving all of their graphic violence content to us, that they didn\u2019t want it anymore. So they had to move more people to cover it. And that\u2019s all that we saw, every single day.\u201d\n\nSpeagle vividly recalls the first video he saw in his new assignment. Two teenagers spot an iguana on the ground, and one picks it up by the tail. A third teenager films what happens next: the teen holding the iguana begins smashing it onto the street. \u201cThey beat the living shit out of this thing,\u201d Speagle told me, as tears welled up in his eyes. \u201cThe iguana was screaming and crying. And they didn\u2019t stop until the thing was a bloody pulp.\u201d\n\nUnder the policy, the video was allowed to remain on Facebook. A manager told him that by leaving the video online, authorities would be able to catch the perpetrators. But as the weeks went on, the video continued to reappear in his queue, and Speagle realized that police were unlikely to look into the case.\n\nSpeagle had volunteered at animal shelters in the past, and watching the iguana die on a regular basis rattled him. \u201cThey kept reposting it again and again and again,\u201d he said, pounding the table as he spoke. \u201cIt made me so angry. I had to listen to its screams all day.\u201d\n\nCognizant\u2019s Tampa facility opened in a maze-like office park in the summer of 2017, about two months after the Phoenix facility came online. It operates out of a single-story building next to a pond fed by two storm drains. On most days, an alligator emerges from one of the drains to bask in the sun.\n\nBefore the office opened, the company began advertising work on Indeed and other job sites, using opaque titles such as \u201csocial media analyst.\u201d Initially, applicants are not told they will be working for Facebook \u2014 only a \u201clarge social media company.\u201d\n\nCognizant was not always straightforward with applicants about the nature of the work in Tampa. Marcus*, who worked in management, told me that a recruiter had persuaded him to leave a more normal job with the promise of a regular schedule, performance bonuses, and a good work-life balance. Once he joined, though, he was made to work nights, and the bonuses never materialized.\n\nFind bodies wherever you can, ask as few questions as possible\n\nMarcus was made to moderate Facebook content \u2014 an additional responsibility he says he was not prepared for. A military veteran, he had become desensitized to seeing violence against people, he told me. But on his second day of moderation duty, he had to watch a video of a man slaughtering puppies with a baseball bat. Marcus went home on his lunch break, held his dog in his arms, and cried. I should quit, he thought to himself, but I know there\u2019s people at the site that need me. He ultimately stayed for a little over a year.\n\nCognizant calls the part of the building where contractors do their work \u201cthe production floor,\u201d and it quickly filled with employees. The minimum wage in Florida is $8.46, and at $15 an hour, the job pays better than most call center work in the area. For many content moderators \u2014 Cognizant refers to them by the enigmatic title of \u201cprocess executive\u201d \u2014 it was their first real job.\n\nIn its haste to fill the workplace, Cognizant made some odd staffing decisions. Early on, the company hired Gignesh Movalia, a former investment advisor, as a moderator. Cognizant conducts background checks on new hires, but apparently failed even to run a basic web search on Movalia. Had they done so, they would have learned that in 2015 he was sentenced to 18 months in prison for his involvement in a $9 million investment fraud scheme. According to the FBI, Movalia had falsely claimed to have access to shares of a fast-growing technology startup about to begin trading on the public market.\n\nThe startup was Facebook.\n\nMovalia was eventually fired, but employees I spoke with believed his tenure exemplified Cognizant\u2019s approach to hiring moderators: find bodies wherever you can, ask as few questions as possible, and get them into a seat on the production floor where they can start working.\n\nThe result is a raucous workplace where managers send regular emails to the staff complaining about their behavior on the site. Nearly every person I interviewed independently compared the Tampa office to a high school. Loud altercations, often over workplace romances, regularly take place between co-workers. Verbal and physical fights break out on a monthly basis, employees told me. A dress code was instituted to discourage employees from wearing provocative clothing to work \u2014 \u201cThis is not a night club,\u201d read an email to all employees obtained by The Verge. Another email warned employees that there had been \u201cnumerous incidents of theft\u201d on the property, including stolen food from the office refrigerator, food from vending machines, and employees\u2019 personal items.\n\nMichelle Bennetti and Melynda Johnson both began working at the Tampa site in June 2018. They told me that the daily difficulty of moderating content, combined with a chaotic office environment, made life miserable.\n\n\u201cIt smelled horrendous all the time\u201d\n\n\u201cAt first it didn\u2019t bother me \u2014 but after a while, it started taking a toll,\u201d Bennetti told me. \u201cI got to feel, like, a cloud \u2014 a darkness \u2014 over me. I started being depressed. I\u2019m a very happy, outgoing person, and I was [becoming] withdrawn. My anxiety went up. It was hard to get through it every day. It started affecting my home life.\u201d\n\nJohnson was particularly disturbed by the site\u2019s sole bathroom, which she regularly found in a state of disrepair. (The company says it has janitors available every shift in Tampa.) In the stalls, signs posted in response to employee misbehavior proliferated. Do not use your feet to flush the toilet. Do not flush more than five toilet seat covers at one time. Do not put any substances, natural or unnatural, on the walls.\n\n\u201cAnd obviously the signs are there for a reason, because people are doing this,\u201d said Johnson, who worked at the site until March. \u201cEvery bit of that building was absolutely disgusting. You\u2019d go in the bathroom and there would be period blood and poop all over the place. It smelled horrendous all the time.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s a sweatshop in America.\u201d\n\nThe work day in Tampa is divided into five shifts, and desks are shared between employees. Contractors I spoke with said they would frequently come to work and find their workstation for the day in dire condition \u2014 encountering boogers, fingernails, and pubic hairs, among other items. The desks would be cleaned whenever Facebook made one of its regular planned visits to the site. At other times, employees told me, the office was filthy.\n\nFlorida law does not require employers to offer sick leave, and so Cognizant workers who feel ill must instead use personal leave time. (They are granted five hours of personal leave per pay period.) Missing work is one of the few reasons Cognizant regularly fires its contractors. And so to avoid receiving an \u201coccurrence,\u201d as the company calls unapproved absences, contractors who have exhausted their break time come to work sick \u2014 and occasionally vomit in trash cans on the production floor.\n\nA manager saw that she was not feeling well, and brought a trash can to her desk so she could vomit in it\n\nA worker named Lola* told me that health problems had resulted in her receiving so many occurrences she was at risk of being fired. She began going into work even when she felt ill to the point of throwing up. Facebook contractors are required to use a browser extension to report every time they use the restroom, but during a recent illness, Lola quickly took all her allotted breaks. She had previously been written up for going to the bathroom too many times, she said, and so she felt afraid to get up from her desk. A manager saw that she was not feeling well, and brought a trash can to her desk so she could vomit in it. So she did.\n\n\u201cThen I was crying at my desk,\u201d Lola said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I can\u2019t go on.\u2019 My co-workers said, \u2018Just go home.\u2019 I said \u2018I can\u2019t, because I\u2019m going to get an occurrence.\u2019\u201d She stayed at her desk and cried.\n\nEmployees told me about other disturbing incidents at the Tampa site. Among them:\n\nAn employee who used a colostomy bag had it rupture while she was at work, spilling some waste onto the floor. Senior managers were overheard mocking her. She eventually quit.\n\nAn employee who threatened to \u201cshoot up the building\u201d in a group chat was placed on paid leave and allowed to return. He was fired after making another similar threat. (A Cognizant spokesperson said the company has security personnel on site at all hours. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that our employees feel assured that they work in a safe environment,\u201d he said.)\n\nAnother employee broadcast himself on Facebook Live talking about wanting to bash a manager\u2019s head in. Another manager determined that he was making a joke, and he was not disciplined.\n\nIn April, two women who work at the Tampa site filed complaints with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that they had been sexually harassed by two of their male co-workers. According to the complaint, the men regularly discussed anal sex in the office. When the women were not receptive to the discussion, one of the men said he \u201cwas going to start a YouTube channel and record himself shooting up the place,\u201d according to the complaint. On April 3rd, the Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Office came to the site to interview the women. According to the officer\u2019s report, one of the men had been photographed following one of the women home.\n\n\u201cwhat am I going to see today? And am I going to make it home tonight?\u201d\n\nA Cognizant spokesman told me that the employee has been suspended while the claims are being investigated. But some workers say they are still concerned.\n\n\u201cEvery time I get an email or a phone call from my clients, I worry that there\u2019s been a shooting \u2014 and I know that\u2019s their worry as well,\u201d said KC Hopkinson, an attorney who represents several current and former Cognizant employees in Tampa. \u201cThey go in there every morning asking, \u2018what am I going to see today? And am I going to make it home tonight?\u2019\u201d\n\nHopkinson told me that her clients who have reported incidents to human resources are generally either ignored or retaliated against, a claim that was echoed to me by several other employees there. In some cases, the site\u2019s human resources staff has followed workers who filed complaints to the bathroom, and questioned them about what they were doing for the few minutes they were inside. (\u201cWe take allegations such as this very seriously,\u201d a company spokesman told me. \u201cCognizant strives to create a safe and empowering workplace.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want my worst enemy to work there,\u201d Hopkinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible environment.\u201d\n\nFor the six months after he was hired, Speagle would moderate 100 to 200 posts a day. He watched people throw puppies into a raging river, and put lit fireworks in dogs\u2019 mouths. He watched people mutilate the genitals of a live mouse, and chop off a cat\u2019s face with a hatchet. He watched videos of people playing with human fetuses, and says he learned that they are allowed on Facebook \u201cas long as the skin is translucent.\u201d He found that he could no longer sleep for more than two or three hours a night. He would frequently wake up in a cold sweat, crying.\n\nEarly on, Speagle came across a video of two women in North Carolina encouraging toddlers to smoke marijuana, and helped to notify the authorities. (Moderator tools have a mechanism for escalating issues to law enforcement, and the women were eventually convicted of misdemeanor child abuse.) To Speagle\u2019s knowledge, though, the crimes he saw every day never resulted in legal action being taken against the perpetrators. The work came to feel pointless, never more so than when he had to watch footage of a murder or child pornography case that he had already removed from Facebook.\n\nIn June 2018, a month into his job, Facebook began seeing a rash of videos that purportedly depicted organs being harvested from children. (It did not.) So many graphic videos were reported that they could not be contained in Speagle\u2019s queue.\n\n\u201cHe just flat-out told me: \u2018I don\u2019t really know how to help you guys\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was getting the brunt of it, but it was leaking into everything else,\u201d Speagle said. \u201cIt was mass panic. All the SMEs had to rush in there and try to help people. They were freaking out \u2014 they couldn\u2019t handle it. People were crying, breaking down, throwing up. It was like one of those horror movies. Nobody\u2019s prepared to see a little girl have her organs taken out while she\u2019s still alive and screaming.\u201d Moderators were told they had to watch at least 15 to 30 seconds of each video.\n\nSpeagle helps to take care of his parents, who have health problems, and was afraid to quit Cognizant. \u201cIt was tough to find a job down here in this market,\u201d he said. To cope with the stress, he began binge-eating pastries from the vending machines, and eventually put on a significant amount of weight. He sought out the on-site counselor for support, but found him unhelpful.\n\n\u201cHe just flat-out told me: \u2018I don\u2019t really know how to help you guys,\u2019\u201d Speagle said. The counselor he spoke with had been substituting for the regular counselor, who had more training. Cognizant also offers a 24/7 hotline, full healthcare benefits, and other wellness programs. But the experience soured Speagle on the site\u2019s mental health resources. Other times, when he was having a particularly bleak day in the queue, a manager would hand him a bucket of Legos and encourage him to play with them to relieve the stress as he worked. Speagle built a house and a spaceship, but it didn\u2019t make him feel better.\n\nBy last fall, Speagle told me, he was sleeping only an hour or two each night. The lack of sleep, coupled with depression, made it difficult for him to exercise. He began lashing out at his parents. Meanwhile, at work, he felt micromanaged by his team leaders, who pressured him to moderate more posts.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was trapped inside my own body,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t, for the life of me, get up from my desk, or I would be yelled at to stay in my desk. So I was trapped at my desk and in my body. I was so scared.\u201d\n\nCognizant periodically purges large numbers of staff members in what have come to be known as \u201cred bag days\u201d for the red bags that managers give to the newly fired to collect their belongings. Sometimes the dismissals are related to job performance, and sometimes employees aren\u2019t given any explanation at all. Speagle was laid off as part of a red bag day last October.\n\nIn February, he went to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with PTSD. He is currently in treatment. Meanwhile, he has gone back to school to get his teaching certificate. Seeing so many children harmed on Facebook made him want to make a positive contribution to the lives of young people, he said.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to make a difference,\u201d Speagle told me of his time working for Facebook. \u201cI thought this would be the ultimate difference-making thing. Because it\u2019s Facebook. But there\u2019s no difference being made.\u201d\n\nI asked him what he thought needed to change.\n\n\u201cI think Facebook needs to shut down,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week, I visited the Tampa site with a photographer. It had received a deep cleaning the night before I visited, according to two employees I spoke with, and the bathroom sparkled. As I walked the floor with the site manager and a Facebook spokeswoman, I noted that most rooms smelled of cleaning products.\n\nWork stopped while we were there to ensure we did not see any Facebook user\u2019s personal information. Moderators, mostly in their 20s and 30s, chatted at their desks, or shot baskets in one of the miniature hoops around the building. The site\u2019s senior managers, who employees say are normally cloistered in their offices, made a show of walking the production floor and chatting with their subordinates.\n\nEvery few feet, a wall decal or poster offered an inspirational platitude. Exhortations to always try your hardest and maintain a positive attitude were punctuated with other signs that came across as slightly more sinister. \u201cNo news is good news,\u201d read one. \u201cOur reputation depends on you,\u201d read another.\n\n\u201cThat was a dog-and-pony show\u201d\n\nWe saw an activity room where workers are invited to participate in yoga sessions, and a break room presided over by a small Buddha holding an electric candle. Across the room from the Buddha, coloring books were fanned out on a table beside windows overlooking the alligator pond.\n\nThe tour ended about an hour after we arrived.\n\n\u201cThat was a dog-and-pony show,\u201d an employee named Bob told me over the phone the next day. \u201cThat was completely staged. We\u2019re out there playing games, and the senior management are out there interacting with people \u2014 it\u2019s all a facade.\u201d\n\nFacebook sees a similar facade when it visits the site, he said.\n\nThe person responsible for managing Facebook\u2019s growing contractor workforce is Arun Chandra, whose title is vice president of scaled support. Chandra arrived at Facebook last November after a long career at HP, where he helped to oversee the company\u2019s global supply chain. In his new role, he told me, he hopes to gradually improve contractors\u2019 standard of living while also working to ensure they become more effective at their jobs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to address the macro picture, and move the bigger things forward in the right way,\u201d said Chandra, who struck me as energetic and deeply sincere. \u201cWe\u2019ll never solve 100 percent, but I\u2019m trying to show I can solve 80 to 90 percent of the larger problems.\u201d\n\nChandra has visited more than a dozen of the company\u2019s far-flung partner sites in the United States and abroad, and has plans to visit them all. When he arrives, he likes to pull rank-and-file contractors into rooms and ask them about working conditions without their managers around. He told me that in the Philippines, content moderation has become an attractive career track, and that everywhere he goes, he meets moderators who take great pride in their work. \u201cThe level of enthusiasm people have is amazing,\u201d he said.\n\nThis spring, Chandra organized a summit of around 200 leaders from content moderation sites around the world \u2014 an event he plans to hold twice a year, with another coming this fall. Up until now, vendors have had different policies and programs for promoting workers\u2019 mental health. At the summit, they agreed to share information about their approaches \u2014 effectively agreeing to stop competing on the basis of who does a better job taking care of workers.\n\nWhile the raises will be a boon to a future workforce, the contractors I spoke to are unlikely to benefit\n\n\u201cWe have to run a very large-scale platform. We have to take care of the community. And that means we have to get a whole lot of work done,\u201d Chandra said. \u201cBut that is not at the expense of [contractors\u2019] well-being.\u201d\n\nChandra plans to launch a new audit program later this year to promote better working conditions. That will include more surprise visits \u2014 an effort to get around the dog-and-pony-show phenomenon I observed last week. He also plans to stop evaluating partners on the sole basis of whether vendors achieve a 98 percent accuracy rate \u2014 instead, he said, Facebook will develop a balanced \u201cscorecard\u201d approach to measuring vendors\u2019 performance. Chandra intends for worker well-being to be part of that score, though Facebook has not yet determined how it will be measured.\n\nIn May, Facebook announced that it will raise contractor wages by $3 an hour, make on-site counselors available during all hours of operation, and develop further programs for its contractor workforce. But the pay raises are not due to take effect until the middle of 2020, by which time many, if not most, of the current Tampa workforce will no longer work there. Turnover statistics could not be obtained. But few moderators I have spoken with make it to two years on the job \u2014 they either are fired for low accuracy scores, or quit over the working conditions. And so while the raises will be a boon to a future workforce, the contractors I spoke to are unlikely to benefit.\n\nNor will the many contractors who have already left the job. As in Phoenix, former employees of the Tampa site described lasting emotional disturbances from their work \u2014 one for which neither Facebook nor Cognizant offers any support.\n\nI asked Chandra whether Facebook should hire more content moderators in house, rather than relying on big staffing companies. He told me that Facebook\u2019s business changes so quickly that it might not be possible. But he did not rule it out.\n\n\u201cI completely get the debate,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything I\u2019m very empathetic to the entire conversation, having spent a lot of time with these people. I don\u2019t think we have a better answer right now.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Facebook is building a \u201cglobal resiliency team\u201d tasked with improving the well-being of both full-time employees and contractors. Chris Harrison, who leads the team, told me that he aspires to build a wellness program that begins at the point of hiring. He wants to screen employees to gauge their psychological fitness \u2014 a move that might prevent someone like Shawn Speagle from being assigned to a queue filled with graphic violence \u2014 but says Facebook is still working to understand whether this is possible under employment law.\n\nHow much is safe?\n\nHarrison plans to make \u201cresiliency\u201d \u2014 the art of bouncing back after seeing something awful \u2014 a key part of contractor training. He helped to develop new tools for moderators that can automatically blur out faces in disturbing videos, turn them grayscale, or mute the audio \u2014 all things that can reduce the psychological harm to the moderator viewing them.\n\nEventually, Harrison hopes Facebook will offer post-employment counseling to moderators who suffered psychological harm on the job. \u201cOf course we should do that,\u201d he said. But the idea is still in the earliest discussion stages, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many layers of complexity globally. It\u2019s really, really hard to pull it off in a legally compliant way.\u201d\n\nI asked Harrison, a licensed clinical psychologist, whether Facebook would ever seek to place a limit on the amount of disturbing content a moderator is given in a day. How much is safe?\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s an open question,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there such thing as too much? The conventional answer to that would be, of course, there can be too much of anything. Scientifically, do we know how much is too much? Do we know what those thresholds are? The answer is no, we don\u2019t. Do we need to know? Yeah, for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s something that were to keep me up at night, just pondering and thinking, it\u2019s that question,\u201d Harrison continued. \u201cHow much is too much?\u201d\n\nIf you believe moderation is a high-skilled, high-stakes job that presents unique psychological risks to your workforce, you might hire all of those workers as full-time employees. But if you believe that it is a low-skill job that will someday be done primarily by algorithms, you probably would not.\n\nInstead, you would do what Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter have done, and hire companies like Accenture, Genpact, and Cognizant to do the work for you. Leave to them the messy work of finding and training human beings, and of laying them all off when the contract ends. Ask the vendors to hit some just-out-of-reach metric, and let them figure out how to get there.\n\nAt Google, contractors like these already represent a majority of its workforce. The system allows tech giants to save billions of dollars a year, while reporting record profits each quarter. Some vendors may turn out to mistreat their workers, threatening the reputation of the tech giant that hired them. But countless more stories will remain hidden behind nondisclosure agreements.\n\nIn the meantime, tens of thousands of people around the world go to work each day at an office where taking care of the individual person is always someone else\u2019s job. Where at the highest levels, human content moderators are viewed as a speed bump on the way to an AI-powered future.\n\nIn such a system, offices can still look beautiful. They can have colorful murals and serene meditation rooms. They can offer ping pong tables and indoor putting greens and miniature basketball hoops emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cYou matter.\u201d But the moderators who work in these offices are not children, and they know when they are being condescended to. They see the company roll an oversized Connect 4 game into the office, as it did in Tampa this spring, and they wonder: When is this place going to get a defibrillator?\n\n(Cognizant did not respond to questions about the defibrillator.)\n\nI believe Chandra and his team will work diligently to improve this system as best as they can. By making vendors like Cognizant accountable for the mental health of their workers for the first time, and offering psychological support to moderators after they leave the company, Facebook can improve the standard of living for contractors across the industry.\n\nBut it remains to be seen how much good Facebook can do while continuing to hold its contractors at arms\u2019 length. Every layer of management between a content moderator and senior Facebook leadership offers another chance for something to go wrong \u2014 and to go unseen by anyone with the power to change it.\n\n\u201cSeriously Facebook, if you want to know, if you really care, you can literally call me,\u201d Melynda Johnson told me. \u201cI will tell you ways that I think that you can fix things there. Because I do care. Because I really do not think people should be treated this way. And if you do know what\u2019s going on there, and you\u2019re turning a blind eye, shame on you.\u201d\n\nHave you worked as a content moderator?
