An adaptation of the Printz Award\u2013winning debut novel of the same name by The Fault in Our Stars author John Green (full disclosure: I have met Green several times, thanks to having been a YA librarian back when his career was first taking off), Looking for Alaska benefits greatly from the participation of showrunner Josh Schwartz, who has explored in previous series like The O.C. and Chuck many of the novel\u2019s concerns, including modes of masculinity, outsider and insider status, zippy dialogue, and male pining for a lofty lust object.\n\nWe first meet our pining male, Miles Halter (Charlie Plummer), as he\u2019s about to depart for boarding school in Alabama: nose buried in a biography of James Joyce while his mother bustles around the house fixing the d\u00e9cor and snacks just so for a going-away party none of his classmates will attend. As his fellow Floridian Tom Petty so memorably noted, the waiting [to get the hell out of Orlando] is the hardest part, and Miles is steadily marking the hours until he can get on with the next phase of his life.\n\nWhen his parents plaintively ask him to explain why he\u2019s leaving their very comfortably middlebrow nest for new acquaintances at an unair-conditioned school in the woods, the young lover of famous, infamous, and forgotten last words summons Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais\u2019s \u201cI go to seek a great perhaps\u201d as his rationale. Culver Creek Preparatory School seems as good a place as any to do that.\n\nOnce Miles arrives on campus and has sent his parents on their way, he meets in quick succession the people who will shape his experiences over the next year. First up is his motormouthed roommate Chip (a.k.a. the Colonel, played by Denny Love, so named for his attention to detail and strategy in executing pranks, which are the most important extracurricular activity at Culver Creek), who immediately dubs Miles \u201cPudge\u201d because he\u2019s so scrawny. The Colonel hurls all of his clothes into his dresser at random and then speed-walks Pudge over to meet Takumi (Jay Lee), a laconic teen spymaster in a Wu-Tang Clan T-shirt.\n\nFinally, we get to see Miles meet the titular Alaska (Kristine Froseth). The Colonel leads the way through her room, already packed to the rafters with plants, fairy lights, and an entire store\u2019s worth of books. (One might even say the room is labyrinthine? Put a pin in that thought, we\u2019ll come back to it in the next episode.) Although, according to the music selections and the gigantic welcome banner, it is extremely 2005, Alaska is dressed like a dream of the late 1970s; she\u2019s directly out of Dazed and Confused, with long, pin-straight light-brown hair, high-waisted pale-blue flares, and a cute little striped halter top. Pudge is instantly smitten.\n\nAs Alaska regales the Colonel with a story about a kid who honked her boob over the summer, she executes a wildly awkward power move by grabbing an unsuspecting Pudge\u2019s hand to demonstrate the boob-honker\u2019s method. Pudge, who certainly did not wake up that morning expecting to clasp a new acquaintance\u2019s breast, leaves his hand in boob-honking position a good ten seconds too long, but saves the moment with a dryly funny retelling of JFK\u2019s last words. Pudge and Alaska\u2019s dynamic \u2014 fueled by Alaska\u2019s storytelling ability and insistent whimsy and Pudge\u2019s awestruck crush \u2014 yields strong Almost Famous vibes, calling to mind the relationship between teen rock correspondent William Miller and his beloved Band-Aid, Penny Lane.\n\nPudge has two more related lessons to learn in his first heady days at Culver Creek: Be prepared to pull pranks as well as be pranked in your turn, in lieu of ever even thinking of ratting out a fellow student. As the Colonel puts it, never, never, never rat.\n\nThe Colonel\u2019s advice turns out to be timely as hell because that night, Alaska\u2019s roommate Marya and her jock boyfriend Paul are caught and expelled for the trifecta of getting high and drunk and then having sex. The next night, the gloriously dim-witted jocks known as the Weekend Warriors roust Pudge from bed, frog-marching him down to the pond, encasing him in plastic wrap, and dumping him into the water as payback to the Colonel for having ratted out Paul. Trying to drown Pudge and impugning the Colonel\u2019s good name is several bridges too far. The Colonel, Takumi, and Alaska all agree: It\u2019s time to go to war, for their own honor, and for Pudge\u2019s. Surely, this will end well!\n\nFamous Last Words\n\n\u2022 Within 30 seconds of Denny Love appearing onscreen, I had committed to watching him in every role he is cast in, forever. His timing! His delivery! The specificity of his physical performance! An Emmy for Denny Love!\n\n\u2022 I\u2019ve read the book, so I know we\u2019re in for a lot of tears, but it\u2019s impossible to ignore how funny this episode is. Special shout-outs to Pudge\u2019s parents and their commitment to delivering one of history\u2019s worst sex talks, and to the Weekend Warriors for their total inability to deliver a comeback in their first battle with the Colonel.\n\n\u2022 This episode perfectly captures the cruel self-absorption of teens, who find their parents\u2019 feelings sooooo embarrassing but can\u2019t see how absurd their own huge emotions can be.\n\n\u2022 Alexandra Patsavas, veteran music supervisor of the gods, is at work, huzzah! Fellow music nerds, prepare your ears for some sonic treats over the next eight episodes. The best musical cues so far are Buddy\u2019s sad-bastard slow-tempo cover of \u201cMilkshake\u201d playing over Marya and Paul\u2019s foiled tryst, and \u201cThe District Sleeps Tonight,\u201d included in accordance with the Postal Service Act of 2005 requiring all shows set in the mid-aughts to incorporate at least one song from their album Give Up.\n\nVULTURE NEWSLETTER Keep up with all the drama of your favorite shows!
