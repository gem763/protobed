(Paul Sancya/AP)\n\nColumnist\n\nTipping is not about you.\n\nWhen eating out at a restaurant, many diners believe that they should tip on a sliding scale based on the service they receive \u2014 good or bad.\n\nIn keeping score, the scale may go something like this: Having to constantly ask for the water glass to be refilled? A deduction of one percentage point. Receiving the appetizer after the entree with no apologies? Three percentage points off the tip.\n\nCan I be honest and convict myself?\n\nI was on the side of the sliding-scale crowd. I tip, always. However, I hate the tipping system in America because it\u2019s not about rewarding someone for superior service. It\u2019s about guilt-tripping patrons to pay up.\n\n[How much to tip when the service is bad]\n\nEmployers \u2014 either to increase their profit margins or out of concern they will lose business because of higher prices \u2014 force customers to supplement their employees\u2019 wages with tips.\n\nBut the price of my meal should include what it takes for the company to make a fair profit and pay its workers a living wage.\n\nI\u2019d rather pay more for my meal than deal with the discomfort of having to decide how much to tip based on my opinion of a job well done \u2014 or not.\n\nWhen people do not tip appropriately, they can be skewered publicly, which is what happened recently when a New Jersey lawmaker went on Twitter to humiliate a customer who left a 74-cent tip on a $119.26 tab. In his defense, the customer said the service was awful.\n\nI discussed this in a previous column, which garnered so much response that I asked Washington Post food reporter and columnist Tim Carman what he thought about gauging gratuity based on the service you receive.\n\nQ: How should diners tip when they get poor service for whatever reason?\n\nCarman: I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding about tipping in America. Diners have been led to believe that tipping should be based on the quality of the service. But this is not the reason we tip. We tip because restaurateurs in America have shifted the burden of paying for some of their labor costs to diners. So when you don\u2019t tip, it affects the wages of servers.\n\nQ: Really, you shouldn\u2019t deduct from the tip when you\u2019ve received subpar service?\n\nCarman: I think diners need to ask themselves a basic question: Do you get paid when you\u2019re having an off day? When you\u2019re not at your best? When you\u2019re in a bad mood?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, waiting tables is hard work, and servers are only human. They may be having troubles at home, or they may be worried about a loved one. Or maybe they\u2019re just spacing out. Who among us has not done that at our desks?\n\nQ: Why should customers have to correct bad service?\n\nCarman: It\u2019s a tough situation. People want to feel indulged when they\u2019re dining out. That\u2019s part of the reason we go out to eat, to feel pampered for a while, to live in a world where everyone caters to our needs for an hour or two.\n\n[Separate checks and tipping decisions can set off distasteful round of judgment]\n\nI think part of the problem is that diners don\u2019t always realize they can exercise more control at the table. If the server is doing something that they don\u2019t like \u2014 or not doing something they want \u2014 they should just break the spell at the table and tell the server. Just say, politely, \u201cI would like my water glass filled regularly.\u201d Or, \u201cThese entrees came out at the same time as our appetizers, can you send them back to the kitchen so we can enjoy a coursed-out meal?\u201d Or whatever the problem is.\n\nMost servers, I think, will respond better to a kind request at the table than a complaint behind their back.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard. Many people don\u2019t like to be confrontational or even be perceived as confrontational. Plus, they think servers should just know what to do, at all times. But they get busy and distracted, and diners can help them get back on track with a gentle request.\n\nBut if the service doesn\u2019t get better, I would ask the manager to switch out servers. A good restaurant will do that.\n\nQ: So, once and for all, what is the appropriate tip at the table \u2014 for now at least?\n\nCarman: Bottom line: Diners should always tip 20 percent. Always.\n\nIf the service is terrific, you should add more to the tip. But never subtract from the 20 percent.\n\nCarman won me over.\n\nLike it or not, tipping isn\u2019t about me \u2014 or you. It\u2019s simply a responsibility placed on all diners in this country. And you need to factor that in as the full cost of dining out.\n\nReaders may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or michelle.singletary\n\n@washpost.com.
