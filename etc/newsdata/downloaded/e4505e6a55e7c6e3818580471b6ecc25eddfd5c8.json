It looks to be taking a big step forward by offering a 5G modem integrated directly into the CPU, instead of requiring a separate modem just to be able to support the next-generation network.\n\nIt\u2019s a small change, but an important one: much like Qualcomm, which is promising to add a 5G modem to its next Snapdragon flagship, Samsung is making 5G support the default option for future phones and tablets that use Exynos chips. It also means that Samsung can save internal space by not needing the extra modem chip, which should also help make 5G use more power-efficient.\n\nThe new Exynos 980 chip is built on an 8nm process, and offers support for 5G to 2G networks. Samsung promises it\u2019ll be capable of gigabit speeds for LTE and up to 2.55Gbps sub-6GHz 5G speeds. Notably missing from the announcement? Support for mmWave networks, which operate at a higher wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum and serve as the base for Verizon\u2019s current 5G network.\n\nThe new eight-core chip also is said to have better performance overall, with a particular focus on the onboard neural processing unit (NPU) for AI tasks, which Samsung says is 2.7 times faster than before. The chip also supports cameras up to 108 megapixels, and up to five individual sensors.\n\nIf past history is anything to go by, though, don\u2019t expect to see an Exynos 980 in any US phones soon \u2014 Samsung tends to reserve its in-house chips for international variants of its devices, sticking with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon processors and modems for the US versions. But with production of the Exynos 980 set to start before the end of this year, it\u2019s possible that it could show up in phones like the Galaxy S11.\n\nGiven that the S10 lineup this year had a separate, pricey 5G variant, between Qualcomm and Samsung\u2019s commitment to integrated 5G, it\u2019s possible that next year\u2019s Samsung flagships could have support by default. And that\u2019s a far more interesting prospect than whatever speed boost Samsung is making here.", "description": "Samsung has announced its next in-house Exynos processor at IFA 2019, and it looks to be taking a big step forward by offering a 5G modem integrated directly into the CPU, instead of requiring a separate modem just to be able to support the next-generation network.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H8w7rmtTnqQC-yULmFuFOeuFvt8=/0x20:1000x544/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19167901/Exynos_980_main1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
