Have you missed the 6K TV revolution, you might be wondering? Where have an extra few million pixels come from? Here\u2019s what you need to know about these new 6K cameras.\n\nThe most recent cameras we\u2019re referring to are the Panasonic Lumix S1H (max resolution of 6,000 pixels by 4,000 pixels) and the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K (max resolution of 6,144 pixels by 3,456 pixels) \u2014 they\u2019re not the first and they won\u2019t be the last to offer video recording at resolutions up to and including 6K.\n\nActually, if you\u2019re a serious movie maker, we\u2019re getting close to the tipping point where you\u2019re going to be looking for 6K rather than 4K (3,840 by 2,160 pixels) shooting capabilities. Yet at the same time you\u2019re not going to see 6K films and shows appear on Netflix any time soon (these cameras tend to use variable aspect ratios for a start).\n\nSo why buy a camera that captures in 6K when you know you\u2019re not going to be showing the end result in 6K?\n\nThe Panasonic Lumix S1H. (Image: Panasonic)\n\nIn short: More pixels. Like 4K before it, that 6K jump gives videographers more flexibility. They can crop down a scene in post, or shrink down an image to reduce some of the graininess. Those extra pixels can be useful in all kinds of ways.\n\nThink about when video gets stabilised: Algorithms shift the position of frames so the scenes and objects are aligned rather than all over the place, which means some frames get pulled left or right, and some get pulled up or down. As a result, the edges of the frames often get lopped off as each one is adjusted, ultimately leaving you with a lower resolution than you started with.\n\nIf you start out with a 4K resolution, you\u2019re going to lose some pixels and some quality if that video gets stabilised. If you start with a 6K resolution, you can apply some pretty aggressive stabilisation techniques and still come out with a crisp, genuine 4K movie at the other end. This does require some know-how from the user for framing shots a little wider than usual.\n\nThe same sort of principles apply in post-production too. 6K footage is going to place more demands on a video editing rig, but it\u2019s a small price to pay when you\u2019ve got all those extra pixels to play around with \u2014 visual effects have more raw pixels to work with, for example, even if the end result gets scaled down.\n\nBlackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K. (Image: Blackmagic)\n\nGreen screen effects can be cleaner with a larger resolution and more pixels too, and when you see the amount of editing and layering modern-day films use for replacing what\u2019s real and physical with what\u2019s digital and computer-generated, it\u2019s easy to understand how extra pixels can boost fidelity and realism \u2014 the more dots on the canvas, the better.\n\nThen you\u2019ve got the cropping and panning options we alluded to earlier in regards to video stabilisation. If you\u2019re going to output a 1080p video to YouTube that\u2019s a fraction of the size of an overall 6K frame, so you can pan across a fixed 6K shot with no loss of quality.\n\nYet another area where 6K can help is in pulling stills from a video, whether that\u2019s to promote the film, or as a side project, or for any other reason \u2014 those stills are going to be better quality than they are at 6K compared to 4K (all other factors being equal).\n\nEssentially, it gives filmmakers and editors many more options when it comes to working on projects, not just in what can be done, but in the sort of quality that can be retained. It\u2019s worth the investment even if no one else ever sees a 6K end result.\n\nOn a more technical level, 6K also helps with what\u2019s known as demosaicing, which is basically an algorithm-led part of the photo-taking process that uses approximations to reproduce real-life colours in a digital picture. The higher the resolution, the fewer approximations are required.\n\nAnd finally there\u2019s what\u2019s known as oversampling, or shooting lower-resolution images with higher-resolution sensors. The end results are similar to what you get if you shrink a bigger image down to a slightly smaller one in a photo editor\u2014sharper edges, less aliasing, in theory \u2014 but in this case, it\u2019s done on the camera itself.\n\nYou\u2019re capturing more data than an image actually needs in order to improve it, and it\u2019s another tool in your toolkit if you want to end up with 4K results but can capture in 6K at the outset.\n\nAdd to all those reasons the way that technology just inevitably rolls forward to newer standards, even when there\u2019s not a huge demand for them, and it makes a lot of sense to film your movies in 6K then rejigger them to 4K rather than starting with 4K in the first place: It gives you a good chance of a better final result in 4K. You get some extra quality, and without the masses of extra data that 8K is going to bring.\n\nSure, 6K might only have a brief moment in the sun before 8K arrives to replace it, but for a lot of pro users it\u2019s worth paying for the most pixels you can get your hands on. For the rest of us, you\u2019re probably still ok with your phone.", "description": "Just when you think you\u2019re safe and secure in your camera buying choices \u2014 ready to pick up a new model with state-of-the-art 4K video recording \u2014 along come the likes of Blackmagic and Panasonic with new 6K-capable models.
