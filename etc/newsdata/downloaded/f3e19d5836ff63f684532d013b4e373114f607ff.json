A 15-13 Titans lead extended to a shocking 43-13 final.\n\nWalker\u2019s quote was a clever twist on the Denny Green original \u2014 and we appreciate that.\n\nThis was the 35-year-old Walker\u2019s first regular-season action since injuring his ankle in Week 1 last season against the Miami Dolphins. And he returned in style, too, scoring two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to power the rout.\n\nSo Walker can pretty much say whatever he wants. He and the Titans dismantled the Browns in this one.", "description": "The Titans thumped the Browns in Week 1, and Tennessee's veteran tight end turned a clever phrase in stinging Cleveland after the game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zijssiY2UatQgFyrL_dLtQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WnNPh9MFeFuotAhL99wpYQ--~B/aD0yMzg2O3c9MzU3OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/bff44600-d27e-11e9-8fef-f94c774046ee", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
