For the first time since Trump launched his trade war, American households face price increases because many U.S. companies say they\u2019ll be forced to pass on to customers the higher prices they\u2019ll pay on Chinese imports.\n\nFor more than a year, the world\u2019s two largest economies have been locked in a high-stakes duel marked by Trump\u2019s escalating import taxes on Chinese goods and Beijing\u2019s retaliatory tariffs.\n\nThe two sides have held periodic talks that seem to have met little progress despite glimmers of potential breakthroughs. All the while, they\u2019ve imposed tariffs on billions of each other\u2019s products in a rift over what analysts say is Beijing\u2019s predatory tactics in its drive to become the supreme high-tech superpower.\n\nAmerican consumers have so far been spared the worst of it: The Trump administration had left most everyday household items off its tariff list (valued at $250 billion in Chinese products so far) and instead targeted industrial goods.\n\nThat\u2019s about to change. \u201cThey\u2019re on. They\u2019re on,\u201d Trump said Friday about the new tariffs that are set to kick in at 12:01 a.m. Sunday. Under the new schedule, 69% of the consumer goods Americans buy from China will face his import taxes, up from 29% now.\n\nThat isn\u2019t all. Higher tariffs are set to kick in for another batch of Chinese products \u2014 $160 billion\u2019 worth \u2014 on Dec. 15. By then, roughly 99% of made-in-China consumer goods imported to the United States will be taxed, according to calculations by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nOverall, Trump\u2019s trade war will have raised the average tariff on Chinese imports from 3.1% in 2017, before the hostilities began, to 24.3%.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that, for the first time, Trump\u2019s trade war is likely to directly raise prices for a lot of household budget items like clothing, shoes, toys, and consumer electronics,\u201d Bown wrote in an report.\n\nFor months, Trump \u2014 who famously declared that trade wars are \u201ceasy to win\u201d \u2014 falsely claimed that China itself paid the tariffs and that they left Americans unscathed. In fact, U.S. importers pay the tariffs. They must make a high-risk decision: Whether to absorb the higher costs themselves and accept lower profits. Or pass on their higher costs to their customers and risk losing business.\n\nThis has become an ever-more-difficult decision. After years of ultra-low inflation, consumers have grown more resistant to price hikes, especially when they can easily compare prices online for household products and choose the lowest-price options. For that reason, many retailers may choose not to impose the cost of Trump\u2019s higher tariffs on their customers.\n\nAnd the higher costs U.S. importers face could be offset somewhat by the declining value of China\u2019s currency, which has the effect of making its products somewhat less expensive in the United States.\n\nStill, the prices of certain goods will cost Americans more. Trump tacitly acknowledged this a few weeks ago by announcing a delay in his higher tariffs on $160 billion in imports until Dec. 15 \u2014 to keep them from squeezing holiday shoppers.\n\nEven before the December tariffs, though, 52% of shoes and 87% of textiles and clothing imported from China were to be hit by Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to Peterson\u2019s Bown. And not even counting the increase \u2014 from 10% to 15% \u2014 that Trump announced for his new tariffs a week ago, J.P. Morgan had estimated that his import taxes would cost the average household roughly $1,000 a year.\n\n\u201cThe story that holiday goods (were) given a reprieve is fake news,\u201d said Stephen Lamar of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Overall, the 15% September and December tariffs will force Americans to pay an extra $4 billion a year for shoes and boots, according to a footwear trade group.\n\nRetailers, engaged for a battle for survival with Amazon and other e-commerce rivals, are bracing for the worst. Macy\u2019s raised an alarm when it reported earnings in August: In May, Trump had raised separate tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. In response, Macy\u2019s tried to raise prices of some items on the hit list \u2014 luggage, housewares, furniture. But according to CEO Jeff Gennette, customers just said no.\n\nSome retailers are trying to force their suppliers to eat the higher costs so they won\u2019t have to raise prices for shoppers. Target confirmed to The Associated Press that it warned suppliers that it won\u2019t accept cost increases arising from the China tariffs. Some small retailers are even more vulnerable.\n\n\u201cAny cost increase puts us in a tough place,\u201d said Jennifer Lee, whose family owns the Footprint shoe store in San Francisco. \u201cIt makes it tough for business owners because we will have to take a hit on our margins, but it will also be difficult for us to pass it on to our shoppers.\u201d\n\nAlbert Chow, who owns Great Wall Hardware in San Francisco, said he\u2019s already raised prices on some Chinese-made products because an earlier round of tariffs led his suppliers to raise prices 10% to 20%.\n\n\u201cI will try to keep the prices down for as long as I can,\u201d Chow said. \u201cBut at some point, when the tariffs are just too much, we have to eventually raise the prices, and then it goes down to the end user \u2014 the customer.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s frustrating for retailers is that consumers might otherwise be in an exuberant mood this holiday season: For most Americans, their jobs are safe and their wages are rising. Unemployment is near a half-century low.\n\nYet the economy itself looks increasingly fragile. Growth is slowing as the global economy weakens. And Trump\u2019s mercurial approach to trade policy \u2014 imposing, delaying, re-imposing import taxes via tweet \u2014 makes it nearly impossible for companies to decide on suppliers, factory sites and new markets. So they delay investments, further straining the economy.\n\n\u201cWe worry about the average family in this country paying $500, $600, even $1,000 more annually because of the impact of tariffs,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe worry about what it means for business confidence, business certainty and investment.\u201d\n\n___\n\nD\u2019Innocenzio reported from New York.
