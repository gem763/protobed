The jockeying is set to rev into overdrive Thursday through this weekend, when the entire Democratic field will descend on Manchester for the state party\u2019s annual convention.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBy this point in 2016, the state\u2019s senior senator and governor were taking part in massive rallies for Hillary Clinton, and most of the state\u2019s superdelegates were enthusiastically on board. Yes, this is a much different race. But the level of ambivalence \u2014 or insistence on seeing more from the field \u2014 is striking. And it speaks to the sentiment among political insiders that New Hampshire can\u2019t afford to get it wrong this time.\n\n\u201cI have to forget about personal friendships,\u201d said Bill Shaheen, a superdelegate who is married to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who is up for reelection next year. \u201cI have to think who has the moxie to take on Trump.\u201d\n\nOn a recent day in downtown Concord, the coffee shop across the street from the statehouse was teeming with Democratic campaign operatives meeting with potential endorsers. As that courtship drags out, campaigns have been forced to use young staffers to kick off traditional retail-politics events, instead of well-known headliners who can draw big crowds.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

An early August survey by the Boston Globe and Suffolk University had him at 21 percent, Bernie Sanders at 17, Elizabeth Warren at 14 and Kamala Harris at 8.\n\nWarren appears to lead the pack with 50 staffers in New Hampshire; Biden and Sanders have 45 each. Among lower-tier candidates, Cory Booker has hired 30 people, Beto O\u2019Rourke 25 and Kamala Harris 20.\n\nAn unscientific survey of nearly two dozen New Hampshire Democratic insiders confirmed they\u2019re overwhelmingly undecided in the primary. Only 2 of the 14 Democratic state senators and about 15 of 233 Democratic state representatives have backed a candidate among the 20 running.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, we were laughing at the Republicans\u201d over the size of the GOP field, said Raymond Buckley, chairman of the state Democratic Party.\n\nAt a recent dinner party at the home of Rep. Annie Kuster, eight friends sat around a table to talk about the primary. The guests broke down the pros and cons of their favorite candidates but realized there was a stalemate, with each liking a different candidate.\n\nDemocratic campaigns are expected to spend a record-breaking amount of money on the state race: as much as $150 million, according to an estimate by the state party, based on the cost of previous primaries.\n\nThe battle for endorsements is already getting personal.\n\nAfter Concord Mayor Jim Bouley endorsed Booker, for instance, at least one campaign reached out to national media outlets to point out he lobbies for 3M, a company involved in several lawsuits for allegedly tainting groundwater in the state. Bouley did not return a call for comment.\n\nFormer Gov. John Lynch, an early Biden supporter who left office in 2013 after four terms with a 70 percent approval rating, downplayed the importance of endorsements this cycle, predicting not even his will sway many voters.\n\n\u201cIt's all about retail politics,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cPeople want to look them in the eye and ask them questions.\u201d\n\nAnecdotally, some New Hampshire pols have said candidates have showered less attention on them and the state than they\u2019re accustomed to. Meeting the donor and polling qualifications for Democratic debates has forced candidates to spend more time on a national strategy, they said.\n\n\u201cBy this point last cycle, I had had lunch or dinner with Gov. [Martin] O\u2019Malley four times,\u201d said Jay Surdukowski, an activist who made the maximum-allowed contribution to O\u2019Rourke the day he announced his bid and skipped work to see him speak in Texas. \u201cBeto knows who I am, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s calling saying, \u2018Hey how\u2019s it going? What\u2019s happening in New Hampshire today?\u2019 He seems to really be doing a national thing now.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders campaigns in Epsom, N.H., on Tuesday. | Mary Schwalm/AP Photo\n\nSurdukowski said he\u2019s been surprised to see people in their early 20s \u2014 instead of major political players \u2014 headlining candidate events like picnics and backyard rallies.\n\n\u201cI know the Beto folks are religiously meeting with people very quietly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re also keeping channels open to people who have already endorsed other candidates. Who knows? Biden may stumble.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s nine superdelegates are staying out of the primary so far, too.\n\nSen. Shaheen has said she will remain neutral; her husband said he needs more time. Sen. Maggie Hassan, who as governor endorsed Hillary Clinton five months before the primary, said she may pick a candidate at some point, but not yet. The same is true for Kuster and Rep. Chris Pappas.\n\nFormer state party Chairwoman Kathy Sullivan is the only superdelegate not to be asked for an endorsement.\n\n\u201cNo one has asked me to endorse, though there may be a good reason,\u201d she said, pointing to some of her previous picks, such as Bruce Babbitt and Bob Kerrey.\n\nSome candidates are getting creative with their courtship. At another dinner at the Kuster home, Booker heard one of the congresswoman\u2019s sons was studying to get into law school.\n\n\u201cCory said, \u2018Let me do a video for him,\u2019\u201d Kuster said. \u201cHe grabs my phone and does this very funny and very genuine video about how hard exams are, but this will be worth it in the long run.\u201d\n\nEvery presidential candidate is expected to attend the party\u2019s convention. Campaigns hope being able to see all the candidates in one place will help make up minds. They want to sign up a trove of volunteers who can get to work evangelizing now that summer is over and more voters are starting to pay attention.\n\nTickets are still available to Saturday\u2019s event, though the party declined to say how many have been sold. They have a high bar to meet: President Donald Trump set a record for attendance three weeks ago at the same arena, besting Elton John and WWE events with more than 11,500 people.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article misspelled Bob Kerrey's name.", "description": "The entire Democratic presidential field is set to descend on the state this weekend, desperately seeking endorsements.", "authors": ["Trent Spiner"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f9/ea/7070f74147c8b6ab8ef3ec1c8591/20190904-biden-nh-speaks-ap-773.jpg"}
