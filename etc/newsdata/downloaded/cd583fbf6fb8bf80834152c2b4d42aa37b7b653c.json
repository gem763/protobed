It\u2019s a Legal Pickle for Trump Officials", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Your boss, the president of the United States, directs you not to help Congress in the impeachment inquiry he considers illegitimate. Then you get a subpoena from the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee ordering you to appear and testify under oath \u2014 or face contempt charges if you don\u2019t. Other than call a lawyer, what are you supposed to do next?\n\nFor growing number of Trump administration officials, this isn\u2019t a hypothetical situation. Since White House counsel Pat Cipollone\u2019s Oct 8 letter refusing Trump administration participation in the House impeachment inquiry, five current or freshly resigned foreign policy officials have chosen to testify before the inquiry despite being told to keep quiet. Meanwhile, some officials under subpoena haven\u2019t yet agreed to testify. And the White House has so far blocked the release of many, but not all, of the documents subpoenaed by the House.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to depict the subpoenaed officials who have agreed to appear as heroes, choosing service to the republic over personal loyalty to the president. That may even be true of some of them. But the legal reality of their dilemma makes things a little more complicated.\n\nA subpoena comes with the threat of enforceable penalty \u2014 that\u2019s what the word \u201csubpoena\u201d (sub=under; poena=penalty) actually means. In theory, if you disobey a subpoena, Congress could seek to have you arrested and jailed.\n\nBut the most a president can do to an executive branch official who testifies is to fire the official. Several of the officials who have spoken to Congress had already stepped down \u2014 they can\u2019t be fired.\n\nAs for those still in the employ of the executive branch, their careers are already in serious jeopardy. For such officials, the extra risk of losing their jobs probably doesn\u2019t outweigh the possibility that their reputations might be rehabilitated by cooperating with the investigation.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Donald Trump\u2019s directive to officials not to appear may itself be unlawful. The Cipollone letter offers no credible legal argument for why Trump is refusing to cooperate with the House\u2019s inquiry. For officials faced with the choice between a lawful subpoena from Congress and a potentially unlawful presidential order, it makes more legal sense to testify.\n\nThe strangest and most fascinating case is that of Gordon Sondland, who is still currently the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Testimony by others strongly indicates that Sondland was at the heart of the effort to make Ukraine investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. Sondland was supposed to appear October 8, but Trump told him not to testify, and he didn\u2019t show. Yet Sondland did ultimately testify on October 17.\n\nSondland\u2019s motivations are uncertain. And Trump could still fire him \u2014 although doing so might look like an admission of guilt on the president\u2019s part. It seems certain, however, that Sondland is not a hero for coming forward. He\u2019s caught in a dilemma in which all options are bad, and he chose the one that seemed the least terrible.\n\nOther current officials face a murky situation, but are at least in a better position than Sondland. Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich still works for the State Department, but she had little to lose by talking to the House, given that the Trump administration had already recalled her from Ukraine, one of the worst things that can happen to an ambassador. Her testimony vindicated her as a staunch anticorruption advocate sidelined by shadowy forces within the Trump administration.\n\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, Yovanovitch\u2019s former deputy chief of mission, also still works for the government and also testified. The White House initially pressured him not to appear; but he ultimately decided to go ahead anyway. Kent, like Yovanovitch, was angry about how Ukraine policy had been taken away from career diplomats and handed off to the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWhat about officials who\u2019ve recently resigned? They may seem free and clear, but the reality could be more complicated. According to the legal doctrine of executive privilege, there are some communications between the president and his advisers that must be shielded from being the subject of testimony so that the president can do his job effectively \u2014 indeed, this is the only credible legal argument Trump could use to stop any officials from giving testimony.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Your boss, the president of the United States, directs you not to help Congress in the impeachment inquiry he considers illegitimate.
