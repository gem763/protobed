Lawyers may also be standing by.\n\nThe World Cup was plunged into unprecedented chaos on Thursday, amid cancellations and recriminations caused by the approaching Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nSRU chiefs remain on a collision course with World Rugby over their Japan clash will take place\n\nTV screens showed the path of the Super Typhoon as the tournament officials addressed issue\n\nTwelve hours after Sportsmail broke the story that England\u2019s Pool C encounter with France had been called off, World Rugby announced that Le Crunch was one of two fixtures being abandoned, due to the impending arrival of the tropical storm, which has been officially classified as \u2018violent\u2019.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s match with Italy was also called off \u2014 denying the Azzurri the mathematical possibility of claiming a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nTournament officials confirmed all four teams affected by the cancellations would be awarded two points each \u2014 with the games declared 0-0 draws, in line with regulations.\n\nThat scenario would condemn Scotland to a pool-stage exit but Townsend expressed belief the powers-that-be would ensure the Pool A decider takes place.\n\n\u2018We believe the game hasn\u2019t been cancelled because the weather forecast is much improved for Sunday,\u2019 he said. \u2018It looks like the game will be played.\n\n\u2018I would hope that everyone who is involved in the tournament would want the game to be played and that they will do all they can to ensure it is.\n\nWorld Cup tournament director Alan Gilpin addressed the situation at a press conference\n\n\u2018The situation is changing a lot. We\u2019ve been told that Sunday looks clear now but the infrastructure might not be in place even though the weather is nice. That\u2019s where we have to believe and have faith that the game will be played, even if it\u2019s behind closed doors or at a different venue.\n\n\u2018The way I read the rules was that you can\u2019t change days but you could change venues and contingencies would be in place.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve since been told there is force majeure (measures in the rules) and things can change because of exceptional circumstances. If that means Monday because it takes a day for things to be put back in order, then who knows? Right now, I think they\u2019re planning on it going ahead on Sunday.\u2019\n\nTownsend said the tournament\u2019s credibility was at stake, adding: \u2018It will make things very unusual for a World Cup in any sport to be decided by a game being called off on one day. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re looking out your hotel windows at 5 o\u2019clock on Sunday and it\u2019s sunny, it would be strange if a game couldn\u2019t take place that day or the following day.\u2019\n\nPrivately the SRU remain concerned the game will be called off at the last moment, Sportsmail reporting on Thursday senior SRU sources saying they would be \u2018furious\u2019 if the game did not go ahead.\n\nAt a meeting held by World Rugby and tournament organisers in Tokyo, it was made clear to the SRU that there were no contingency plans in place to play the game on Monday. It was Sunday or not at all. But the SRU top brass travelled to Yokohama insisting it is well within the rules to play the game a day late if it is postponed due to bad weather.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis is being put on par with a category 5 hurricane with 160mph winds expected\n\nSportsmail understands the SRU made clear to World Rugby that the over-riding imperative should be for the match to be played and claimed tournament rules expressly empowered the organisers to postpone rather than cancel the game totally.\n\nA statement read: \u2018With potential impact on our last Pool A fixture, Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch, and will be flexible to accommodate this.\u2019\n\nBut tournament director Alan Gilpin has already ruled out a change of date, saying: \u2018We have looked again at the potential to apply some consistency to our contingency plan across all the games and we treat all the matches fairly.\n\n\u2018Italy are in the same position as Scotland are in. It is a huge match and we would be loving to play that game. But we won\u2019t treat that match any differently.\u2019", "description": "SRU chiefs remain on a collision course with World Rugby after the decision on whether Sunday's make-or-break game with Japan goes ahead was delayed until the morning of the match.", "authors": ["Rob Robertson For The Scottish Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/23/19562052-0-image-a-84_1570746625316.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
