One home sustained major damage and another had exterior damage.\n\nThe fire also damaged three passenger vehicles, two recreational vehicles and multiple backyards. Fire officials said medics treated one civilian on the scene.\n\nFire crews fully contained the blaze and are investigating the cause.\n\nThe fire came after Pacific Gas & Electric shut off electricity to more than a million homes and businesses throughout the state.\n\nThe utility began systematically cutting power to portions of dozens of counties on Wednesday, anticipating strong winds that can breach power lines and spark fires. Thursday, the blackouts were expected to continue until the wind risk subsides.\n\nPG&E, the state\u2019s largest utility, initially said up to 900,000 homes and businesses would be impacted by the three-phase plan. Thursday, it said that figure could grow to exceed 1 million, which would include about 3 million residents statewide.\n\nDepending on the weather, the outages could last into this weekend.\n\nPG&E reported several updates late Wednesday, saying it restored power to abut 50,000 customers in the Sierra Foothills and had started the second phase of the blackout plan earlier Wednesday afternoon. It also said it soon expected to restore power to another 80,000 homes and businesses.\n\nThe threat of wildfire in California is high, and there were several wildfires burning across the northern part of the state. The largest, the Briceburg Fire, was 25 percent contained and burned 4,900 acres as of Thursday afternoon. It prompted mandatory evacuations in Mariposa County since Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of unburned fuel on the ground from the rains last winter and spring \u2026 and with the high winds, that\u2019s the big problem tonight, we could very easily get into a situation where a wildfire got away from us, that\u2019s the last thing we want to happen,\u201d Contra Costa County Fire Protection District spokesman Steve Hill said.\n\nPG&E agreed last month to pay an $11 billion settlement over its role in contributing to wildland fires in California in 2017 and 2018 \u2014 including the Camp Fire in Butte County, the largest in California history, which killed more than 80 people last fall. PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January after learning it could be liable for up to $30 billion in wildfire claims.", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 A short-lived vegetation fire in Southern California damaged two homes Thursday amid state-wide power outages to avoid starting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
