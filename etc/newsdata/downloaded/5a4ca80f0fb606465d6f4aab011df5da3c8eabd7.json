Roberts Jr. is the chief justice of the United States, not the chief justice of the Supreme Court. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nIt\u2019s fun to beat up on Hollywood, as I\u2019ve been doing periodically for the last few weeks, pointing out the mistakes that pop up regularly in movies and TV shows: hawk cries dubbed in for bald eagles, stethoscopes worn the wrong way, male Army officers with long hair \u2026\n\nBut he who is not without sin should not live in a glass house. Or something like that. What I mean is, reporters get things wrong, too.\n\nFor example, the District\u2019s Ted Gest observes that John G. Roberts Jr. is chief justice. \u201cBut of what?\u201d Ted asks. \u201cThe answer is that he is chief justice of the United States.\u201d\n\nRoberts is not, as he is often referred to by the news media and the general public, the chief justice of the Supreme Court or the Supreme Court chief justice.\n\nWrote Ted: \u201cIt is true that administratively he is the head of the Supreme Court, but the significance of his title is that he is the head of the entire federal judiciary \u2014 a branch of government.\u201d\n\nAnd what makes Ted Gest so goshdurn sure of himself? He covered the Supreme Court for more than 15 years for U.S. News and World Report, \u201cincluding Chief Justices (of the United States) Warren Burger and William Rehnquist.\u201d\n\nJoel Albert used to work at WRC-TV, where he helped manage the changeover in the way that the news was recorded for later broadcast. It bugs him when \u201cprint guys\u201d refer to someone \u201cfilming\u201d something for the evening news.\n\n\u201cFilm hasn\u2019t been used for news-capture since about 1980,\u201d wrote Joel, of Potomac, Md. \u201cAfter that, it would have been correct to say \u2018taping\u2019 or \u2018taped.\u2019 Now, tape is passe too and \u2018record\u2019 or \u2018video record\u2019 would be accurate. Maybe just \u2018video\u2019 [or] \u2018videoed.\u2019\u201d\n\nYears ago, Monica Nelson of Fairfax City, Va., worked for a cement importer. \u201cOf course, we knew that cement is a powder, a binder that is mixed with an aggregate and liquid to make a mix that becomes concrete when set up,\u201d she wrote.\n\nYou are unlikely to be injured by falling cement, or by hitting a cement jersey wall, or by being tossed into a river wearing cement galoshes.\n\nWrote Monica: \u201cThat is concrete, concrete, concrete.\u201d\n\nLee Rucker Keiser of Bethesda wrote in on behalf of her late father, Donald Rucker, who came to Washington in 1965 to help set up a little social program called Medicare. His favorite \u201calways wrong\u201d usage was found in stories about polls, where an age category of survey respondents would often be described as \u201cover 65.\u201d\n\nWrote Lee: \u201cMost likely the correct description would be \u2018Age 65 and over.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd to prove her point, Lee linked to an op-ed column in that very day\u2019s Washington Post that transformed a category in a Pew Research Center poll from \u201cThose ages 65 and older\u201d to \u201crespondents over 65.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t want to leave out those 65-year-olds!\n\nJeff Hamilton of Jessup, Md., takes issue with the expression \u201cmeteoric rise,\u201d used to describe someone who experiences sudden, astounding success. \u201cThe trouble is, meteors don\u2019t rise,\u201d Jeff wrote. \u201cThey fall.\u201d\n\nI know I said I was going to lay off the Hollywood errors, but I can\u2019t help myself. Or, rather, Charles M. Carron of Alexandria, can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s an attorney and what annoys him is the way lawyer\u2019s offices in movies and TV shows are typically decorated. Often, a bookshelf has three or four law books with volume numbers on the spines, sometimes with one book laid flat, sometimes mixed in with other books, family photos, or bric-a-brac.\n\n\u201cTypically the law books are \u2018reporters\u2019 that comprise official court decisions,\u201d Charles wrote. \u201cFor example, Supreme Court decisions are published in the United States Reports. Volume 560 has all of the Supreme Court cases from the October 2009 term.\u201d\n\nCharles said that no lawyer would have just a few of those reporters scattered on his or her shelves. And they wouldn\u2019t be mixed with other books.\n\n\u201cIn fact, they take so much space that they would be in the law firm\u2019s library, not an attorney\u2019s office,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese days most lawyers research case law online, and it\u2019s hard for retiring lawyers to sell a set of reporters. Probably the film and TV producers have picked up a few volumes at a garage sale.\u201d\n\nIn other words: Objection!\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "John Roberts is the chief justice of what?
