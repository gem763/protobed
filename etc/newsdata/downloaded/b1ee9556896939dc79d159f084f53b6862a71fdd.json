The U.S. criminal indictment released on Wednesday showed the website had processed around 7,300 bitcoin transactions, worth more than $370,000.Son was convicted and is currently serving an 18-month sentence in Korea for trafficking child pornography. Federal authorities in Washington, however, have indicted him on nine additional counts that include money laundering, meaning they could be seeking Son\u2019s extradition to the United States to face justice.\u201cThrough the sophisticated tracing of bitcoin transactions, IRS-CI special agents were able to determine the location of the Darknet server, identify the administrator of the website and ultimately track down the website server\u2019s physical location in South Korea,\u201d said IRS-CI Chief Don Fort. \u201cThis large-scale criminal enterprise that endangered the safety of children around the world is no more.\u201dThe U.S. Justice Department said the website was one of the first internet platforms to monetize child exploitation videos using cryptocurrency, and that the videos offered by the website were downloaded approximately one million times.The probe resulted in raids of businesses and residences of 92 individuals in the United States, and also led to the rescue of at least 23 minors in the United States, Spain and Britain \u201cwho were being actively abused by users of the site,\u201d the release read.The dark web refers to a swath of the internet that is not accessible through regular search engines, the murkiest parts of unindexed internet content known as the deep web. To gain access to these parts of the internet, users have to rely on encrypted software, such as the Tor browser, to hide their identities.This has led to the dark web being used to host a wide range of illicit content, including child pornography, stolen user data like credit card numbers or identity documentation, weapons and illicit drugs.\u201cOur message for those who produce, distribute, and receive child pornography is clear,\u201d said Jessie Liu, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. \u201cYou may try to hide behind technology, but we will find you and we will arrest and prosecute you.\u201dBY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
