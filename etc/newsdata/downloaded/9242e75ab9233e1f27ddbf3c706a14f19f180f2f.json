They are the most nerve-jangling games of all, brutal one-offs in which anything can happen.\n\nAs a coach you feel like your job is on the line - mainly because it is. I've experienced two World Cup quarter-finals - one win, one defeat - and both left me drained. I'm so happy to be in the TV studio this weekend and not on the touchline.\n\nThe psychology of quarter-finals is strange. First, you must realise that semi-finals are safe havens compared to the minefield of quarter-finals.\n\nAs a coach you feel like your job is on the line as you reach a Rugby World Cup quarter-final\n\nEngland face Australia in the quarter-final on Saturday in what will be a nerve-jangling game\n\nReach a semi-final and the pressure comes off. You haven't failed, you haven't bombed. A World Cup semi-final is an achievement in itself and you feel validated. The press and media are reasonably content. You get to stay for another two weeks, the travelling fans are delirious and everything is upbeat.\n\nDefeats are gut-wrenching though. Bundled out and on your way home the very next morning. It's desperate.\n\nA quarter-final loss also wipes out all the good from your pool wins. There is considerable pressure and anxiety pre-match and dealing with that successfully is a big part of quarter-final week.\n\nThen there is the dynamic of who is viewed as the favourites and who are the underdogs.\n\nThe favourites this weekend, for me, are unquestionably England, New Zealand, South Africa and Wales.\n\nEngland, New Zealand, South Africa, and Wales will be the favourites for this weekend's games\n\nBut you don't reach a World Cup quarter-final by accident. They are all good teams.\n\nAustralia, Ireland, France and Japan all have genuine chances this weekend and will love that motivational edge of being labelled underdogs.\n\nA World Cup quarter-final is the first round of another tournament altogether.\n\nWe have seen it so many times. New Zealand deceptively marched through a soft pool in 2007 but were undercooked and then undone by a French team that had been fighting against elimination since the first night when they lost their opening game to Argentina.\n\nAustralia were massive favourites that same day in Marseilles against an England team who had appeared all over the place in the pool games, losing 36-0 to the Springboks and struggling to wins against USA, Tonga and Samoa.\n\nAnd then what happened? England took Australia apart up front. I was there and will never forget the look of shock on George Gregan's face at the first serious ruck when England's heavy brigade, led by Phil Vickery and Andrew Sheridan, brutally counter-rucked right through the Australian forwards. Australia never recovered. Quarter-finals are just different, very different.\n\nAustralia were massive favourites against England in 2007, but England took them apart\n\nIreland were impressive pool winners in 2011, winning four out of four, but had no answer for a fired-up Wales in the quarter-finals. The Irish also suffered at the hands of Argentina four years ago after a brutal win against the French a week earlier had taken its toll.\n\nIt shows that nothing you do in the pools counts for anything in the quarter-finals.\n\nMy quarter-finals were both different. The way the tournament worked in 1999 quite simply gave us little or no chance against South Africa, not necessarily because it was against a very good Boks side but once we lost our pool game to New Zealand the logistics were stacked against us.\n\nIt was the World Cup of those ridiculous quarter-final play-offs, put in place by administrators who clearly had never played the game, only to be abandoned forever after the tournament.\n\nIreland were impressive pool winners in 2011 but had no answers for a fired-up Wales side\n\nWe had to play Fiji on the Wednesday at Twickenham, which was stressful enough because it was sudden death, before decamping to Paris on Eurostar on the Thursday to get ready for South Africa, who had enjoyed a week to prepare.\n\nUnsurprisingly we were well beaten, courtesy of five dropped goals from Jannie de Beer. It was a painful defeat which left me and the team in limbo. Would I be allowed another crack at a World Cup?\n\nFour years later Wales gave England the fright of our lives. We were in a fairly comfortable pool, other than a big match against South Africa, but Samoa had given us a real rattle and I felt that was hopefully our one iffy performance.\n\nThankfully for players and staff, long gone are the days of the ridiculous quarter-final play-offs\n\nThen Wales hit us like a ton of bricks. We had sent a squad XV down to Cardiff in the summer for a warm-up and won at a canter. All week I knew something was wrong so I worked the squad pretty hard trying to banish a sense of complacency. The more I tried to fix it, the worse it got.\n\nThe game kicked off and my worst nightmare unfolded: we just weren't ready for the intensity of Wales' challenge with most of our team having one eye on the semi-final. Big mistake - 10-3 down at half-time and staring at oblivion.\n\nAfter the break the whole team woke up, regained some composure and started to play like the top-ranked team in the world that we were. Replacement Mike Catt started kicking long for field possession, Jonny got his goalkicking going and of course Jason Robinson worked his magic to create a try for Will Greenwood. But it was close; very close.\n\nI was not in the remotest bit surprised a week later when we produced our best performance of the tournament in the semi-final against France.\n\nThe perceived wisdom is that semi-finals are agonising matches that turn you grey but for me, it's quarter-finals every time.\n\nOn form we are looking at semi-finals of New Zealand vs England and South Africa vs Wales, but what price on Japan vs France and Ireland vs Australia? Enjoy a brilliant weekend of rugby.\n\nIn 2003, Wales gave England the fright of their lives in their quarter-final clash in Brisbane", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: Quarter-finals are agony.
