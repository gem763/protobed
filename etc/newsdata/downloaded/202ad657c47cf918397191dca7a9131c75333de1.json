Steelers D-line regroups minus injured star", "language": "en", "text": "PITTSBURGH (AP) - Tyson Alualu was well aware of the nickname long before the veteran defensive tackle arrived in Pittsburgh in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt was always, this is \u2018Blitzburgh,\u2019\u201d Alualu said on Wednesday. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot of blitzes.\u201d\n\nNo matter who is in the lineup, something Alualu doesn\u2019t expect to change with defensive end Stephon Tuitt out for the season after tearing a pectoral muscle against the Los Angeles Chargers on Oct. 13. Tuitt was in the midst of the best football of his career when he left five plays into what became a 24-17 win. Alualu stepped in and played 25 effective snaps as the Steelers gave their season a needed jolt.\n\nDoing it in an emergency situation is one thing. Doing it consistently is another. Yet Alualu is optimistic the snarl that\u2019s defined Pittsburgh\u2019s defense during the opening six weeks of the season - the Steelers are second in the NFL in takeaways (15) and tied for fifth in sacks (20) - won\u2019t change with Tuitt sidelined until 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on you to make plays within this defense,\u201d Alualu said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think they\u2019re asking me to do anything different because Tuitt went down. Of course it\u2019s a blow to our team because of the type of playmaker he was. But they\u2019re not asking me to do anything different. Whatever our game plan is, my job is to go out there and execute and just do my job to the best of my abilities.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old isn\u2019t concerned about being able to take on a bigger workload. He hasn\u2019t played over half the defensive snaps over the course of a season since signing with the Steelers as a free agent in the spring of 2017. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Taking on a lesser role has kept him fresh. The proof came during training camp when rookies such as Isaiah Buggs would be gasping for breath while Alualu sprinted to the huddle ready for the next snap.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging when they\u2019re hurting and complaining,\u201d Alualu said with a laugh. \u201cI feel pretty good.\u201d\n\nSo does Buggs. The sixth-round pick out of Alabama made the team after a solid if not spectacular camp but has yet to take the field during a regular game. That figures to change on Monday when the Steelers (2-4) host Miami (0-6). Waiting for an opportunity hasn\u2019t been easy, but it has allowed Buggs to get a better understanding of the defense and his body. Asked to slim down, the 6-foot-3 frame Buggs has dropped from 306 pounds when he was taken with the 192nd overall pick in late April to somewhere around 290 by cutting out sodas and candy and limiting his \u201ccheat\u201d days to whatever is available at the team hotel on Saturday nights.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Hey you want to be here, get the weight down,\u2019\u201d Buggs said. \u201cThis is a job. Got to treat it as such. That\u2019s what I did each and every day. Worked hard to sustain that weight.\u201d\n\nThe evidence is tangible. Buggs was soaked in sweat as he talked on Wednesday, not long after his daily trip to the locker room scale that\u2019s been monitoring his progress. He hasn\u2019t been this small in a while. He also hasn\u2019t played meaningful competitive football in a while. Both of those things could change by Monday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my job to you know, learn from older guys, so when time comes, it\u2019s time for you to step up and play,\u201d Buggs said. \u201cJust learning first. Everybody has the opportunity to learn first before they get thrown in the water. Now the time is here and I\u2019ve got to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one. Buggs is playing to prove he belongs in the NFL. Javon Hargrave is playing to prove he deserves to stay. The Steelers opted not to offer the fourth-year defensive tackle a contract extension over the summer even though Hargrave was coming off a breakthrough season in which he had a career-high 6\u00bd sacks.\n\nTuitt\u2019s injury will allow defensive coordinator Keith Butler to experiment with the versatile Hargrave, who fit the mold of a prototypical nose tackle when he was drafted in the third round in 2016 but has proved to be effective wherever he\u2019s asked to squat his 6-foot-2, 305-pound frame on a given snap.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the NFL, you either grow or you don\u2019t,\u201d Hargrave said. \u201cEvery year I\u2019ve gotten better and try to get better at what I do. I\u2019m more confident than ever and just really ready to put it out there.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The NFL placed LB Anthony Chickillo on the Commissioner Exempt List on Wednesday. Chickillo was arrested by Pennsylvania State Police on Sunday on three misdemeanor charges stemming from an altercation with his girlfriend at a western Pennsylvania resort. Chickillo will be paid and is allowed into the team\u2019s facility but cannot practice or play while on the exempt list. \u2026 The team signed linebacker Jayrone Elliott to fill Chickillo\u2019s roster spot.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tyson Alualu was well aware of the nickname long before the veteran defensive tackle arrived in Pittsburgh in 2017.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Will Graves"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
