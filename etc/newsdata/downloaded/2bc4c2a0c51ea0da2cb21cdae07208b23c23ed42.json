I had a panic attack on the side of the motorway and my parents had to come and get me, I literally cried the whole night as my dream house had just crumbled in front of my eyes.\"\n\nMs Moffatt said despite the setback, she rang Bellway in an attempt to salvage the deal and spoke to several officials but said she was spoken to \"rudely\".\n\n\"I hope nobody else has to go through the stress an upset we have been through,\" she added.\n\nIn a statement, Bellway - one of the UK's largest house builders - said it would be \"inappropriate and unprofessional to comment\" - and that it was \"incredibly proud of our customer service\".\n\nMs Moffatt said the couple were devastated, adding: \"Mine and my partner's dream house, which we have worked so hard for, is gone.\n\n\"We are extremely upset but angry more than anything with how we have been treated. It seems that they thought we are a young couple so let\u2019s bully them out of the house - and this is not ok.\"\n\nMs Moffatt said the couple had been searching for a property for a year and had visited the Willow Grange development on various occasions looking for the \"perfect home\".\n\nShe added: \"We were looking for a home to start a family in, so after a few months of back and forth, we finally decided on a four-bedroom detached house, so reserved the house.\"\n\nMs Moffatt said after being shown the plans, they were told there was a mine shaft close to the house - prompting the couple to ask about the risks involved - but said the issue \"was brushed under the carpet and we still have not received the information\".\n\nAccording to the customer, a number of other issues with the builder included that her name had been spelt incorrectly, with the deposit amount also allegedly incorrect.\n\nShe claimed the couple had also been overcharged for flooring, leading them to email the customer care and Mr Honeyman.\n\nThe firm has refunded the overpayment, she said - but \"no other part of our complaint was addressed\".\n\nThen, last week, a letter addressed from the firm's north-west managing director David Williams to Ms Moffatt, said he was \"very sorry\" the couple had \"found it necessary to email Mr Honeyman\".\n\nThe letter added that \"all\" of the errors could have been easily rectified, adding that the flooring had indeed been refunded.\n\nIt said: \"We do not believe that any of the issues raised in your email warrant a goodwill gesture from Bellway, and we also feel that due to the nature of your email and how unhappy you seem to be, Bellway is not the builder for you.\n\n\"We have therefore instructed our solicitor to request contract documentation back from your solicitor, and the property will be placed back on the open market.\"\n\nA spokesman for Bellway Homes said: \u201cAs an NHBC five star accredited housebuilder, we are incredibly proud of our customer service and feel that it would be inappropriate and unprofessional to comment on individual customer cases which remain a private matter between ourselves and our customers.\u201d", "description": "Emma Moffatt and partner Jordan Burns say they were told Bellway homes were 'not the builder for them' after letter", "authors": ["Tom Houghton", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Xxxxxxxxx Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20534298.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_House-builder-cancels-first-time-buyers-new-home-reservation-after-they-complained-to-CEO-2053417.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
