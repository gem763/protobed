Tariq Zehawi, Danielle Parhizkaran and Melanie Anzidei, North Jersey Record\n\nThe day has finally arrived after 15 sometimes grueling years.\n\nAmerican Dream, the giant entertainment and retail mega-center in East Rutherford, was scheduled to open its doors Friday for North Jersey and the rest of the world to see. Now comes the hard part: Will the sprawling mini city, which the developer expects to attract 40 million visitors annually, be a hit or miss for retail?\n\nThe mega-center, developed by Canada\u2019s Triple Five, will be nearly impossible to replicate. But, some retail experts say, it could serve as a North Star for the retail industry. Once fully operational, it will be a test case for experiential retail, and whether the concept can be successful in one of the country\u2019s most competitive markets.\n\nAmerican Dream in East Rutherford, N.J. on Tuesday Oct. 22, 2019. (Photo: Tariq Zehawi and Danielle Parhizkaran/NorthJersey.com)\n\n\u201cPeople are going to be watching this project and its success,\u201d said Chuck Lanyard, president of The Goldstein Group, a retail brokerage firm in Paramus, New Jersey. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see other malls across the country finding ways to be that creative in order to be lucrative and successful.\u201d\n\nTriple Five is known for being a leader in experiential retail. The developer runs Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota \u2014 often looked to as the first destination mall in the United States \u2014 and West Edmonton Mall in Canada. The company is also building American Dream Miami, which could be the country's largest mall once complete.\n\nExperiential retail is a concept where retailers or shopping centers create experiences that will lure shoppers to their properties, where they later shop. It also describes a mode of retail where shoppers are engaged with a product or in-store offering.\n\nA traditional shopping center may invest in on-site experiences by opening a luxury movie theater, upping its dining options or even investing in virtual reality tenants or escape rooms. American Dream's experiences are much more extreme: a theme park, water park, indoor ski slope and aquarium. The list goes on. Tenants, experts predict, will likely also have experiential components inside their stores as part of their leases.\n\n6-year, 0% loan for a mattress?: Intense competition continues to grip mattress industry\n\nAmazon earnings: One-day shipping is attracting more shoppers but denting profits\n\nExperiential retail was conceived out of necessity by the retail industry.\n\nWith the rise of the internet, online shopping drastically changed consumers' spending habits. People were no longer flocking to brick-and-mortar stores because they could do their shopping from home. That ate into the profits of some of the country's biggest retailers \u2014 namely, the department stores that were mainstays inside traditional malls. When those retailers went dark, malls struggled. Mall owners had to get creative with their offerings to attract shoppers, or else they, too, would fail.\n\nDespite the grim state of retail nationwide, American Dream will be entering an already-crowded \u2014 and profitable \u2014 regional retail market. In North Jersey, the retail sector is thriving. That, Lanyard said, is largely a testament to the wise decisions that mall developers have made to keep area malls bustling. In Paramus, often seen as North Jersey's retail capital, the borough's malls are constantly reinventing themselves.\n\nWestfield\u2019s Garden State Plaza in January unveiled an ambitious plan to bring mixed-used residential development to the property. That project will eventually create a miniature downtown at the mall, with an outdoor ice rink and sprawling green space for its residents. The mall already ranks among the top 10 most profitable malls in the country, according to CNBC, and was not struggling when it announced the sweeping proposal.\n\nGarden State Plaza has also been partnering with first-to-market retailers, like a virtual reality provider who will be opening its first New Jersey store there later this year. Toys R Us is also expected to open a store at the mall next month, in the popular retailer\u2019s much-talked-about rebirth this holiday season.\n\nParamus Park Mall, once struggling, recently welcomed New Jersey\u2019s first Stew Leonard\u2019s supermarket to its roster. The new tenant filled a vacancy left behind by Sears, a longtime tenant, and has helped increase traffic to the property. Over the past several years, The Outlets at Bergen Town Center has also reinvented itself as a destination for off-price shopping. In nearby Hackensack, the Shops at Riverside is undergoing a major luxury transformation and has welcomed fine dining to its halls.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey has some of the strongest demographics in the country,\" Lanyard said, \"but even here these mall operators very wisely retooled and re-positioned their malls so each one of them draws new, different kinds of clients now in their own special way.\"\n\nA changing retail landscape\n\nThe retail world has been changing for decades.\n\nIn the 1950s, shoppers ditched downtown businesses for malls in the suburbs \u2014 then just a shiny, new concept for families. Because those malls across the country are now either dying or changing, retailers have started to see the writing on the wall.\n\n\u201cI think the future of retail is pretty clear,\u201d said Jan Rogers Kniffen, a national retail consultant. \"Sometime between now and 2030, 50% of all retail is going to be sold online.\u201d\n\nThat means retailers are investing in smaller footprints and more showrooms, and focusing more on delivering their products to customers quickly, Kniffen said. Retailers are also putting emphasis on in-store services. The kind of retail that is succeeding, he added, are off-price, resale and rental. Simply put, he doesn\u2019t see the future of retail looking like American Dream. He sees traditional malls continuing to evolve in ways already seen in communities like Paramus.\n\nA quick guide: How to get to the American Dream mega-mall\n\nMall of America: Mall of America paved way for American Dream. What I learned at the country's largest mall\n\nGarden State Plaza: Virtual reality coming to Westfield Garden State Plaza as The VOID will open first NJ post\n\nTraditional malls are \"going to have less apparel in them, they\u2019re going to have more restaurants, they\u2019re going to have more entertainment venues,\" Kniffen said. \"They\u2019re going to be more like a traditional mall and less like an amusement park. American Dream is just an amusement park with some retail in it.\"\n\nThe three-million-square-foot retail and entertainment center will be 45% retail and 55% entertainment. Some experts say that combination will be key for the project's success, making it \"internet-proof.\"\n\nTo Kniffen, American Dream's unique setup makes it an anomaly. The project is too one-of-a-kind to be used as a marker for the retail industry, he said, much like Hudson Yards, the mixed-use neighborhood along the Hudson River in Midtown Manhattan that is home to offices as well as more than 100 shops and restaurants.\n\nBecause of the vast resources that went into the project, it would be impossible for the average mall developer to replicate what Triple Five has done in the Meadowlands with the American Dream, Kniffen said. He also predicts most people who visit the property will be going for its entertainment offerings, and not for shopping \u2014 even though tenants may very well benefit from the sites' anticipated 40 million annual visitors.\n\n\"It\u2019ll be interesting by the time it\u2019s all done to see what kind of retail really does survive in American Dream the best,\" Kniffen said. \"Are you going to go to buy your American Eagle jeans at the Dream? I doubt it. I bet you we\u2019re going to see a change in the nature of the kind of retail that succeeds there.\"\n\nWith the retail side of the project slated to open by March, the retail world won't know how successful stores inside the project are until at least spring 2021, Kniffen said.\n\nBut not all retail experts see retail as an afterthought at American Dream.\n\nLanyard, who helped secure an H-Mart supermarket on the property, is steadfast in his belief that American Dream will serve as a shining example for the industry. Although malls may not be investing in their own theme parks, he does predict shopping centers will turn to East Rutherford for inspiration.\n\n\u201cAmerican Dream is really the shopping mall of the future,\u201d Lanyard said. \u201cIf malls are going to survive, they\u2019re only going to survive with the components they\u2019ve put together.\u201d\n\nEmail: anzidei@northjersey.com Twitter: @melanieanzidei\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/25/american-dream-changing-times-retail/2454341001/", "description": "Will the center, eventually the home of hundreds of stores, restaurants and countless entertainment options, be a hit or a bust?", "authors": ["Melanie Anzidei", "Published P.M.
