The sprawling metropolis, one of the most diverse cities in America, reflected the diversity of the Democratic field, which featured women, people of color and a gay man.\n\nOver the course of three hours, Democrats debated a central question animating the primary contest: do they want to return to an era of politics that existed before the Trump presidency or do they favor policies that go far beyond the last administration?\n\n\u201cI stand with Barack Obama, all eight years, the good, bad and indifferent,\u201d Biden said, defending himself against an attack on his record.\n\nThe ABC News debate opened with a clash over healthcare, one of the sharpest differences among the candidates and a top priority for Democratic voters.\n\nWrapping himself in Obama\u2019s legacy, the former vice-president confronted his progressive challengers over the cost of Medicare for All, which would cover every American under a government health plan and essentially eliminate private insurance, accusing Warren of not being forthcoming about whether the plan would raise taxes on the middle class.\n\n\u201cI know the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d he said of Warren\u2019s support for Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All healthcare plan. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kamala Harris makes a point flanked by Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang.

Warren shot back: \u201cI\u2019ve never actually met anybody who likes their health insurance company.\u201d\n\nThe former vice-president also challenged Sanders\u2019 proposal to force employers to effectively pay out union members for any savings from a shift to a single-payer health system. \u201cFor a socialist, you\u2019ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do,\u201d he said.\n\nA highly anticipated showdown between Biden and Warren, who is steadily gaining on him in the polls, never fully materialized into open warfare. By contrast, Sanders came prepared to draw sharp contrasts with Biden on trade and foreign policy. The Vermont Senator slammed Biden for his vote in favor of the Iraq war. \u201cThe truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq,\u201d said Sanders, who opposed it.\n\nBut overall the conversation broadened away from the dynamic of the top three, leading to one of the sharpest skirmishes of the evening between Biden and former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nIn a testy back-and-forth, Castro, 44, alluded to voter concerns about Biden\u2019s age when he continued to press the former vice-president about whether he had forgotten a piece of his healthcare plan. If elected, Biden would be the oldest first-term president at 78.\n\nPlay Video 0:36 Castro questions Biden's memory during third Democrat debate \u2013 video\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro asked, eliciting gasps from the audience. Castro, who also served the Obama administration, boasted: \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nAs they sparred, Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, appealed for unity.\n\n\u201cThis is why the presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d he said. \u201cThis reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s called an election,\u201d Castro snapped back. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re here for.\u201d\n\nQuestions about gun violence, immigration and trade with China also revealed a difference of opinion and a hefty dose of criticism of Trump. The California senator Kamala Harris accused the president of using \u201chate, intimidation, fear\u201d, to divide the country. The New Jersey senator Cory Booker called Trump \u201cracist\u201d.\n\nFormer Texas representative Beto O\u2019Rourke and Castro, the two Texans in the race, spoke emotionally about the mass shootings that rocked the state last month. In El Paso, 22 people, many of them Latino, were killed at a Walmart by a gunman who invoked Trump\u2019s language in describing the motivation for his attack. Weeks later, a gunman killed seven people during a shooting spree between the Texas cities of Odessa and Midland.\n\n\u201cA few weeks ago, a shooter drove 10 hours, inspired by this president, to kill people who look like me,\u201d Castro said. He called white supremacy a \u201cgrowing threat to this country\u201d.\n\nPlay Video 1:42 Beto O'Rourke on gun control: 'Hell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15' \u2013 video\n\nO\u2019Rourke did not shy away from saying he would require citizens to turn in their military-style weapons, despite Republicans\u2019 frequent accusations that Democrats are coming to take Americans\u2019 guns.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AK-47,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in one of the biggest lines of the night. O\u2019Rourke was also the recipient of praise from other candidates on the stage \u2013 including Biden and Castro \u2013 for his actions in dealing with the tragedy in his native El Paso.\n\nWhich Democrat has the best climate crisis plan?

Biden is a relative moderate with plans that would build on the work of the Obama administration and Warren is a progressive who has called for \u201cbig, structural change\u201d through an expanding portfolio of detailed policy plans.\n\nThere were also moments of levity in Houston. Harris erupted in laughter after drawing a comparison between Trump and the \u201creally small dude\u201d behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elizabeth Warren has called for \u2018big, structural change\u2019.

So I just came out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was that when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and they re-elected me with 80% of the vote.\u201d", "description": "Healthcare opened up clear differences between frontrunners but Donald Trump was the key target amid a more conciliatory tone", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino", "Lloyd Green"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77d660c908555cba76b6c6bb21c38fdc000efe8a/32_0_3436_2064/master/3436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dcc9c6f7e7666967184d3c6be291900d", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
