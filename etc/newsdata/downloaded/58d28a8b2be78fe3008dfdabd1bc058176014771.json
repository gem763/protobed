(Charles William Kelly) More\n\nThe funeral home says Stephens was fired for not complying with the dress code for men, even though she was dressed professionally as a woman.\n\n\"If Stephens had wanted to dress in a different way not on company time, that was fine. But as long as anybody was at work, this [company dress code] applied to all employees -- male or female,\" said John Bursch, attorney for Harris Funeral Home.\n\n\"It has the effect of making sure the clients at the funeral home can process their grief and not ever be focused on the funeral home or its employees,\" Bursch said.\n\n(MORE: Supreme Court to hear Louisiana abortion case in first test for conservative majority)\n\nTwo lower federal courts sided with Stephens, calling her firing \"impermissible discrimination.\"\n\nThe Trump administration, which is not a party in the case, took the step of asking the Supreme Court to reverse the decision.\n\n\"Proving discrimination because of sex under Title VII requires showing that an employer treated members of one sex less favorably than similarly situated members of the other sex,\" Solicitor General Noel Francisco argues in court documents.\n\n\"Treating all transgender persons less favorably than non-transgender persons does not violate that rule,\" Francisco wrote.\n\n(MORE: Supreme Court blocks Trump on census citizenship question, he calls ruling 'ridiculous' )\n\nPHOTO: Donald Zarda, seen here with his partner Bill Moore, was fired in 2010 by Altitude Express, Inc., after telling a customer that he was gay.
