Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, in recent remarks.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON BACKS OUT OF DC EVENT ALSO SET TO INCLUDE TULSI GABBARD, KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: REPORT\n\nClinton in recent weeks has privately stated she would enter the 2020 presidential race if she were certain she could win, The New York Times reported Tuesday. The story, titled \u201cAnxious Democratic Establishment Asks, \u2018Is There Anybody Else?\u2019,\u201d said about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City questioned whether former front-runner Joe Biden could stand strong against Trump, citing Biden\u2019s lackluster debate performance in Ohio last week.\n\nhey also raised concerns about Biden's fundraising struggles and his need to defend his family\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine amid the ongoing Trump impeachment inquiry.\n\nThey also said Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were likely too liberal to win the general election.\n\nMeanwhile, The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, reported that Clinton was considering a 2020 rematch against Trump after the State Department concluded this week there was \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information\" regarding Clinton's use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state.\n\nThe same State Department report, however, dozens of individuals were at fault for mishandling classified information and found hundreds of security violations during her 2009-2013 tenure.\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT REPORT ON CLINTON EMAILS FINDS HUNDREDS OF VIOLATIONS, DOZENS OF INDIVIDUALS AT FAULT\n\nClinton, the first woman to win a major party presidential nomination \u2014 and the national popular vote leader with almost 3 million more votes than Trump \u2014 remains a popular figure in her party, even after enduring criticism for losing key Midwestern states in 2016. For Republicans, she's perennial target -- currently in the Mississippi governor's race, where Democratic nominee Jim Hood, a longtime attorney general, is being attacked for acknowledging he voted for her over Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nClinton\u2019s supporters within the Democratic establishment have also passed around an op-ed published earlier this month in the San Francisco Chronicle by former Mayor Willie Brown titled: \u201cWho should run against Trump? How about Hillary Clinton?\u201d the Washington Post reported.\n\nBoth the Post and the Times reported that Clinton was not the only possible last-minute candidate on Democrats\u2019 minds. Also being considered were: former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Disney chief executive Bob Iger, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and former first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Speculation is growing that\u00a0Hillary Clinton will make a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race\u00a0after reports published Tuesday said members of the Democratic establishment doubted any of the party\u2019s current top candidates can beat\u00a0President Trump\u00a0next November.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Hillary-Clinton-Colbert.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
