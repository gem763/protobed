It\u2019s a common condition: approximately 10 per cent of people will experience BPPV before they die.\n\nDespite its prevalence, vertigo\u2019s cause borders on the mystic. Deep inside the ear, thousands of tiny crystals help you keep your balance. But if something knocks the crystals out of place, they\u2019ll set you spinning.\n\nBut the more I read about ear crystals, the less I felt I understood. What is a crystal? Why, exactly, are we so dependent on microscopic pieces of calcium carbonate in our ears? And can I sell mine on the booming healing crystal market?\n\nHe told me that every organism needs to know which way is up and which way is down, but there\u2019s no single solution to this problem. Plants, for example, have little starch-filled organelles in their roots, which may help them push deeper into the soil.\n\nSome aquatic invertebrates like lobsters have a tiny pouch in their heads that capture and hold grains of sand. Fish have a few large crystals, each called an otolith. And mammals have tons of tiny crystals called otoconia.\n\nIn human ears, the gravity sensors are structured a bit like a toothbrush covered in extra-crunchy paste: There\u2019s a bed of motion-sensing hairs (the bristles), topped with a dollop of goop (the toothpaste), upon which the crystals rest.\n\nWhen the otoconia slide, they tug the hair cells as they go. The cells transmit that information through a cranial nerve to the brainstem, letting you know where your head is in space. While these ear crystals are sticky, they aren\u2019t actually embedded in anything. That\u2019s good, because it means they can constantly shift alongside our centre of gravity. But it\u2019s also bad, because they can escape. And they do.\n\nOtoconia live in two little cavities called the utricle and saccule. In a design flaw that should have Creationists shaking, the utricle actually has a tiny opening at the top. When you\u2019re really unlucky, a crystal or two will pop out of this skylight and into one of the ear\u2019s three semicircular canals, which take up residence nearby. That\u2019s when things get topsy-turvy.\n\n\u201cIn young people, the crystals are pretty, they have this hexagonal symmetry \u2014 they look like a piece of quartz. In old people, they look moth-eaten \u2014 they\u2019re raggedy.\u201d\n\nOtoconia in the utricle detect head tilts and linear acceleration, or how fast the body moves forward. But the semicircular canals activate in response to angular acceleration, which is the change in an object\u2019s rotation.\n\nWhen you feel dizzy in the middle of a pirouette or, more likely, your third ride on the Gravitron at the county fair, it\u2019s because the liquid in the canals is sloshing around. But if rogue otoconia have jammed up the system, you can feel that same spinning sensation standing up, laying down, or bending over.\n\nFor most of human history, the cause of vertigo was unknown, said Carol Foster, an otolaryngologist at the University of Colorado, Denver School of Medicine and author of Overcoming Positional Vertigo.\n\nIt was only in the mid-1800s that scientists began to understand what the inner ear even did. Their methods were not PETA-approved\u2014they drilled into the heads of live pigeons and damaged or removed parts of their labyrinth.\n\nWhen they noticed the pigeon\u2019s eyes spun around in their sockets in response to this assault, and the birds struggled to stand up or walk around, the scientists realised they were tinkering with the seat of balance.\n\nIt took another century for doctors to actually develop a solution for vertigo. In 1980, John Epley first described his eponymous manoeuvre, now the standard course of treatment for BPPV. It\u2019s a physically involved, multi-part process. Doctors first spin the patient\u2019s head in a way that triggers their vertigo. The goal is to see which way their eyeballs roll.\n\nIf the eyes jump up, that indicates the crystals are lodged in the posterior canal; if they move sideways, they\u2019re stuck in the lateral canal; and if they spin downward, they\u2019re blocking the anterior canal. Having identified the problem area, doctors swiftly turn the patient\u2019s head in the appropriate direction with karate-like precision in order to spin the crystal out of the canal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the Cracker Jack game with the marble,\u201d Foster told me. Done successfully, it alleviates dizziness in more than 90 per cent of BPPV patients.\n\nOf course, not everyone with a loose crystal develops vertigo. Otoconia can dissolve, or vestibular dark cells, which exist only in the inner ear and help to regulate homeostasis, can absorb them. And not all crystals are equally troublesome.\n\nWhen we\u2019re born, we have thousands more otoconia than we need, but over time their numbers dwindle, and those that are left show signs of age. \u201cIn young people, the crystals are pretty, they have this hexagonal symmetry \u2014 they look like a piece of quartz,\u201d Hain said.\n\n\u201cIn old people, they look moth-eaten \u2014 they\u2019re raggedy.\u201d That might be why older people are more likely to experience BPPV: their crystals are more likely to break apart and drift away.\n\nListening to Hain describe this inevitable decay, I realised just how short life really is. And I can\u2019t help but wonder, could those of us whose crystals are still young and beautiful make a quick buck?\n\nI was there to meet Sadie Kadlec, a crystal healer. Many cultures have used earth elements in magic or medicine. But when it comes to hawking rocks, ancient Egyptian pharaohs have nothing on contemporary wellness culture, which has pulled the formerly fringey New Age practice into the mainstream.\n\nPractitioners use different coloured stones, which they claim can align and enhance the body\u2019s energy centres, or chakras. (As you may already know from Instagram, rose quartz, being pink, supposedly works the heart chakra.)\n\nThe fact that there is no evidence crystals have any special powers hasn\u2019t stopped them from becoming a billion-dollar industry.\n\nOver coffee at a nearby cafe, I told Kadlec what I\u2019d discovered: Many animals have calcium carbonate crystals in their ears. But just as diamonds and graphite are both pure carbon, calcium carbonate can come in different forms. Fish otoliths, for example, are typically aragonite, while human otoconia are calcite.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me it\u2019s part of our makeup,\u201d Kadlec said of calcite. The crystal can come in many colours and, she claimed, serve many different energetic purposes, which may be why online retailer Energy Muse calls it \u201cthe multi-vitamin of the soul.\u201d The calcite in our ears is white, the colour of the crown chakra, where Kadlec said it helps to restore balance of the metaphysical kind.\n\nKadlec mentioned a transparent form of the stone, called optical calcite, or Iceland spar. Historians think it\u2019s the \u201csunstone\u201d mentioned in medieval Norse texts \u2014 a polarising crystal that helped Viking navigators find the Sun on a cloudy day. In healing circles, Kadlec told me, it works much the same way, by \u201chelping you see where your horizon is, and where to go next.\u201d\n\nAragonite also comes in several shades. In fish heads, it\u2019s usually white, but in the world of healing crystals, it\u2019s often a ruddy hue. That makes it a crystal for the root chakra, Kadlec told me, so, she claimed, it helps people stay grounded.\n\nMaha Rose\u2019s crystal shop sells both of these calcium carbonate crystals. On Etsy, you can find otolith jewellery \u2014 typically a combination of fish ear stones and another healing mineral, like snapper earrings suspended from pebbles of rose quartz or bracelets with boho and sea glass. But there are a few major obstacles to monetising the potential healing power inside my ears.\n\nThe first is that I would suffer severely without my ear crystals. Many people live with inner ear damage, which can be triggered by untreated or severe infections, like vestibular neuritis, or certain types of ototoxic antibiotics, like gentamicin.\n\nThese patients \u201care pretty unhappy for quite a long time,\u201d Hain told me. They struggle to coordinate their movement. \u201cIt\u2019s like their eyes are painted on their head,\u201d he said. And that increases their risk of falls. When they do drop, some don\u2019t go down so much as sideways, the result of their impaired sense of gravity.\n\nMost people find a new equilibrium after a year or two, Hain said, but they probably don\u2019t play sports or drive after dark, and they rely on their remaining senses to compensate for what they\u2019ve lost.\n\nEven people with healthy ears experience a dwindling crystal supply. Some scientists think otoconia simply cannot replenish themselves, while others speculate they grow back more slowly than they degrade.\n\nThose who think otoconia are finite may find support in an old NASA experiment, Hain told me. In the 1960s, scientists put 12 guinea pigs in a centrifuge, and spun the machine at 400 Gs. (For reference, that\u2019s 44 times the force of acceleration experienced by fighter pilots.)\n\nThey dissected six of the rodents immediately, and found that almost all of the otoconia had left the saccule and utricle. Six months later, they dissected the other guinea pigs and discovered the lost otoconia did not return, and new otoconia failed to grow. Humans and guinea pigs are wildly different animals, but if I sold the crystals in my ears today, it\u2019s safe to assume I\u2019d never get them back in full.\n\nThat makes harvesting my otoconia ethically fraught. Right now, the vast majority of healing crystals come from mines (a smaller percentage is synthesized in laboratories). People pull honey-coloured tiger\u2019s eye and milky-green jade out of the earth \u2014 often to the detriment of their health and that of the surrounding environment.\n\nFor many healers like Kadlec, ethically sourcing crystals is one of the most difficult parts of the job. There\u2019s little transparency, and the odds of acquiring crystals linked to conflict is high. I might be able to freely consent to otoconia extraction, but few would want to buy calcium carbonate with such a troubling origin story.\n\nThe other, more commercial issue is that ear crystals are impossibly small\u2014roughly one-fifth the width of a human hair. Almost everything we know about them comes from electron microscopes, which magnify objects up to a million times their real size.\n\nThe resulting images show the pointy crystals that live inside us like miniature Washington Monuments. But to the rare doctor who\u2019s seen otoconia with their own two eyes, they\u2019re individually indistinguishable, and collectively no more than a speck of white paste.\n\nIn the world of healing crystals, Kadlec says many people mistakenly think that \u201cbigger is better.\u201d Surely, the thinking goes, an 5kg quartz \u201ctower\u201d should outperform a pebble. But Kadlec believes a crystal\u2019s size is irrelevant.\n\nAt a certain point, she claims, students in her advanced class can learn to adjust vibrational energy with only their mind and body, no stones involved. But for people who are still using crystals to alter their chakras, Kadlec claims you need to see and feel the energy from the object\u2014an impossibility with my puny otoconia.\n\nSo though I\u2019m ultimately unable to sell my ear crystals, I appreciate them more than ever.", "description": "If you\u2019ve ever been dizzy without a cause \u2014 no alcohol in your system, no blunt trauma to the head, no ear infection \u2014 you may have experienced benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.
