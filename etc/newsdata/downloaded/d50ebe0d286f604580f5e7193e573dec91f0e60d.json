Her swimsuit was exposing too much of her buttocks, an official ruled.\n\nThe referee\u2019s call, which is now being appealed by the Anchorage School District, has generated intense debate among Alaska\u2019s close-knit swim and dive community, and prompted a larger discussion about how female athletes\u2019 bodies are policed and scrutinized. Lauren Langford, who coaches swimming at another high school in the area, told The Washington Post that she believes racism, in addition to sexism, may have been a factor, given that the teen is among the few nonwhite athletes in a predominantly white sport.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAll of these girls are all wearing suits that are cut the same way,\u201d Langford said. \u201cAnd the only girl who gets disqualified is a mixed-race girl with rounder, curvier features.\u201d\n\nThe teenager didn\u2019t pick out the swimsuit \u2014 her school chose it and issued it to her. But even though all the girls on her team were dressed identically, she was the only one cited for a uniform violation. Annette Rohde, who was working as an official during the meet, told the Anchorage Daily News that another female ref explained that the bottom of the girl\u2019s suit \u201cwas so far up I could see butt cheek touching butt cheek.\u2019\u2019\n\nRohde froze in disbelief, she said, and warned the referee, who has not been identified, \u201cThis is going to blow up.\u201d Sure enough, the decision reverberated throughout the community, where the teen is known as a top-ranked swimmer likely to go on to compete at the collegiate level.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn a world where young girls are told at every turn that the skin they\u2019re in is not good enough for a thousand reasons, the last thing we need to do in youth athletics is add to that unhealthy dialogue,\u201d Langford, a swim coach at Anchorage\u2019s West High School who coached the teenager and her sisters when they were younger, wrote in a widely shared blog post on Medium after Friday\u2019s meet. She added, \u201cIf you do not like the way that swimsuits fit on these girls\u2019 bodies then don\u2019t look; they are minors, children, and no one should be looking at them anyway.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with The Post on Monday night, Langford said she was angered at the treatment of the teenager, whom she described as \u201cliterally the nicest young lady.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time the girl had been made to feel that her curvy figure was problematic: Last year, a parent took a photo of her backside and shared it with other parents to demonstrate that girls on the team were wearing inappropriate swimwear. (District officials said Monday that Dimond High School\u2019s assistant principal \u201cindicated to the parent who took the photographs that it was not permissible for him to take pictures of others\u2019 children and that he should stop immediately.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThat to me is so inappropriate,\u201d Langford said. She noted that the teen girl has been accused of hiking her suit up on purpose, but anyone who has competed in swimming would know that suits often ride up unintentionally.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have a term for it \u2014 it\u2019s called a suit wedgie,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd wedgies happen. It\u2019s uncomfortable. No one\u2019s going to walk around that way intentionally.\u201d\n\nOver the years, the conservative one-piece swimsuits traditionally worn by competitive female swimmers have been phased out in favor of a higher-cut style that has less fabric and is more hydrodynamic, but also more revealing. The changes in the cut and fit, Langford said, make it \u201ceven more frequent that you\u2019re picking a wedgie.\u201d But a minor, if annoying, wardrobe malfunction is also likely to be the last thing on the mind of a swimmer intently focused on her form as she nears the finish line.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the water, you\u2019re not thinking about it,\u201d Langford said.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, Anchorage School District officials announced that they had reviewed the incident and concluded that the teenager \u201cwas targeted based solely on how a standard, school-issued uniform happened to fit the shape of her body,\u201d and that the referee\u2019s decision was \u201cheavy-handed and unnecessary.\u201d The district has appealed to the Alaska School Activities Association, asking to reverse the swimmer\u2019s disqualification, return all points to her team, and revoke certification for the referee who made the call. The district is also seeking to suspend and eventually revise the guidelines in place for appropriate swimsuit coverage, which officials said were ambiguous and left room for biased interpretation.\n\nAD\n\nThe National Federation of State High School Associations, the governing body for high school athletics in Alaska, simply states that female swimmers must cover their buttocks and breasts. In August, the organization issued a memorandum alerting coaches that \u201csuits are being worn in such a way as to expose the athlete\u2019s buttocks,\u201d and provided an illustrated example of what constituted appropriate coverage. District officials said Monday that Dimond High School \u201cmade deliberate efforts over the last year\u201d to meet those requirements \u2014 in particular, picking out the regulation swimsuit that the teen was wearing when she was stripped of her victory.\n\n\u201cIf the suit was a problem, they all should have been disqualified,\u201d Langford said. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMeagan Kowatch, the teenager\u2019s mother, told KTUU on Monday that the referee who made the call had previously embarrassed one of her other daughters by critiquing the fit of her swimsuit during a meet. She wants to see the results of Friday\u2019s competition overturned, and for that ref to be kept away from her daughters\u2019 races in future, she said.\n\nAD\n\nThough there\u2019s also been some debate about whether racism played a role in the decision, \u201cno one seems to be arguing about if it\u2019s sexism,\u201d Langford said. The National Federation of High Schools also published guidelines for appropriate male swimwear in August, and she said she\u2019s seen young men competing in lower-riding suits than the organization deems appropriate. But to her knowledge, it\u2019s never become an issue.\n\nBy contrast, Langford said, Kowatch has been told by other parents that her three daughters on the team, who are all talented swimmers, need to cover up for the sake of their sons. The disqualified teenager, though usually \u201ctough as nails,\u201d turned teary on Friday night over the referee\u2019s decision, and was \u201cheartbroken\u201d to learn that people were accusing her of purposefully hiking up her swimsuit, the coach said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that she\u2019s been told she\u2019s intentionally trying to draw this sexual attention has really crushed her,\u201d Langford said.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cThe fact that she\u2019s been told she\u2019s intentionally trying to draw this sexual attention has really crushed her,\u201d Lauren Langford, who coached the teenager when she was younger, told The Washington Post.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6eEeMxQ90WCmdCF8CGQZ2CG3GPo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IJVI4GXH5REZBN67JHMVGSAV24.PNG"}
