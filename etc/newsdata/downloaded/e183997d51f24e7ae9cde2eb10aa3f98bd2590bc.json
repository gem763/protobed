It was an embarrassment to the continent,\" he said.\n\n\"As a government, we are quite disturbed by these very unfortunate events and have taken actions and measures to address this issue and prevent their re-occurrence with the South African government.\"\n\nBuhari and South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa agreed to set up better intelligence and share information to pre-empt anti-foreigner sentiment from transforming into violence and bloodshed.\n\nViolent attacks targeting foreigners rocked South Africa notably in 2008 and 2015, shocking a country that suffered racist white-minority rule for decades and which now prides itself as a \"rainbow nation\" for people of all colours and communities.\n\nAfrica's most industrialised economy is a magnet for migrant workers seeking better job prospects on the continent.\n\nNigerians make up a significant part of that population, which also includes people from Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Asia.", "description": "Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday denounced recent xenophobic violence in South Africa as an \"embarrassment\" for the continent, as he wrapped up a state visit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9435/78d5d02e8ad345859911f23684a0fc0d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
