No one was above criticism or blame for the 17-16 defeat in which New York blew a 16-point lead against Buffalo.\n\nNot Sam Darnold. Not the receiving corps. Not the secondary. Not Gase himself.\n\nIn a nearly 13-minute conference call with reporters Monday, Gase put his entire team on notice by pointing out breakdowns and shortcomings of position groups without naming individual players.\n\n\u201cWe made some mistakes,\u201d Gase said of the offense, \u201cand they were fatal for us.\u201d\n\nDarnold and the offense put up only 223 total yards against a stout Bills defense, and managed only 17 first downs. Nine of New York\u2019s points came from the defense, on an interception return for a touchdown by C.J. Mosley, and a safety by Brian Poole and Jordan Jenkins.\n\nLe\u2019Veon Bell looked anything but rusty in his first game in nearly 20 months, catching a touchdown pass and a 2-point conversion. But Darnold finished a mediocre 28 of 41 for 175 yards and the TD to Bell.\n\n\u201cFor me and for our whole team, it\u2019s about hitting the big plays when they\u2019re there,\u201d Darnold said. \u201cWe were dinking and dunking it a lot in the game, which is fine, but we\u2019ve just got to hit the big plays. So when those big plays are there to be made, we\u2019ve got to make those plays and I\u2019ve got to make the throws.\u201d\n\nThe offensive line struggled at times, with center Ryan Kalil playing with Darnold for the first time since coming out of retirement last month. Kalil acknowledged he made some mistakes, and the quarterback didn\u2019t get consistent protection overall.\n\n\u201cI would say that some of it was the O-line,\u201d Gase said, \u201cbut I would say if we read the coverages correctly with the receivers, some of that isn\u2019t a problem.\u201d\n\nThere were plenty of other issues, including the continued kicking woes and the meltdown of the defense in the fourth quarter.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nBefore leaving in the fourth quarter with a groin injury, Mosley was the force the Jets expected. He had the pick-6 and a fumble recovery while quarterbacking the defense.\n\nBell also was solid, finishing with 60 yards rushing on 17 carries, adding six catches for 32 yards.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nWell, this could be a lengthy list, but the cornerback spot is a good one with which to start.\n\nBoth Trumaine Johnson and Darryl Roberts struggled, and they have Cleveland\u2019s Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry to look forward to next Monday night.\n\n\u201cI feel like we have a slight room for improvement,\u201d Gase said. \u201cI will say that nicely.\u201d\n\nThere was no mistaking the kicking game needs an upgrade, especially after Kaare Vedvik missed an extra point and a 45-yard field goal try. The Jets will have some kickers at the facility Tuesday and it would be no surprise if they have someone new teeing it up against the Browns.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d Gase said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t performed well. We are going to try to figure out a way to fix it, that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nJamison Crowder showed he can be a reliable target for Darnold by catching 14 passes in his Jets debut - although he gained only 99 yards.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nThe defense as a whole sputtered when it mattered most, in the fourth quarter - particularly when Mosley left the game.\n\nGregg Williams\u2019 unit allowed no points with Mosley on the field, but gave up a field goal two plays after he left, and 170 yards and 14 points in the last three series without him.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t handle the fact that we lost our middle linebacker very well, and that was something that we addressed today,\u201d Gase said. \u201cBasically we need to understand when we lose somebody, the next guy has to step up. We can\u2019t have any loss of energy, we can\u2019t lose our mind.\u201d\n\nINJURED\n\nMosley (groin) and rookie defensive tackle Quinnen Williams (ankle sprain) were having MRIs, and Gase said both were \u201ctrending\u201d toward not practicing Wednesday. He declined to speculate beyond that.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n4 - As in the stunningly low number of catches Robby Anderson (three for 23 yards) and Quincy Enunwa (one for minus-4) combined for against the Bills.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe early schedule only gets tougher, starting Monday night at home against Cleveland. Next is a game at New England, followed by a bye and then games at Philadelphia, home against Dallas, a Monday night game against the Patriots, and a game at Jacksonville.\n\nGase doesn\u2019t think the loss will carry over into next week - or beyond.\n\n\u201cI see the look in these guys\u2019 eyes,\u201d Gase said, \u201cthe way that they felt after the game, the way they came in here today, the way they have been working so far today as far as the run and lift and their meetings. That one stung everybody.\n\n\u201cAny time you lose a close game like that, it hurts.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Adam Gase sounded just like most Jets fans a day after a brutal, stunning loss Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/bills_jets_football_10608_c0-156-3736-2334_s1770x1032.jpg?1695e4d1b61edd9aa93144c599917e560d283c57", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
