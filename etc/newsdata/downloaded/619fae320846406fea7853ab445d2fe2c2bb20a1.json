Is there life elsewhere in the universe?\u201d said study researcher Matthew Dodd, a University College London biogeochemist.\n\nThe scientists said the primordial microbes\u2019 structure closely resembled modern bacteria that dwell near iron-rich hydrothermal vents. They believe that, like their modern counterparts, they were iron-eaters. The rock\u2019s composition was consistent with a deep-sea vent environment.\n\n\n\nA haematite filament enveloped by a fine irregular layer of nanoscopic haematite from vent deposits in the Nuvvuagittuq Supracrustal Belt in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada is pictured in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters March 1.

It shows that some microbes have not changed significantly\u201d since Earth\u2019s early times, Papineau said.\n\nEarth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and the oceans appeared about 4.4 billion years ago. If the fossils are indeed 4.28 billion years old, that would suggest \u201can almost instantaneous emergence of life\u201d after ocean formation, Dodd said.\n\nThe fossils appear to be older than any other previously discovered evidence of life. For example, other scientists last year described 3.7 billion-year-old fossilized microbial mats, called stromatolites, from Greenland.\n\nReuters", "description": "Canadian bacteria-like fossils called oldest evidence of life", "authors": ["Marios Ioannou"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/359339/1000x563_359339.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-01"}
