They\u2019re talking about her brand in relation to the marketplace: like Madonna if she\u2019d never left CGBG, or like someone playing Pitchfork Fest but also Good Morning America. They\u2019re also talking about her production choices. Her new album, Charli, builds on the style of her 2017 mixtapes Number 1 Angel and Pop 2, which took all the buzz about her as a visionary and converted it into an explicitly \u201cfuturistic\u201d aesthetic\u2014chipperly artificial, digital, distorted. The related visuals have her plastic-wrapped, or gel-coated. Often it sounds like she\u2019s trapped in glitching Bluetooth frequency, or that she thinks the next great single will be in the form of an iPhone notification sound.\n\nThis sonic-hologram approach owes much to the UK collective called PC Music, led by A.G. Cook, who\u2019s now Charli\u2019s \u201ccreative director.\u201d Back around 2015, PC Music\u2019s outrageous dance tracks\u2014jagged but irrepressible, sugary like ant poison\u2014attracted acclaim as, say it again, the future of pop. The time since then has seen mixed success at making that hype a reality. The PC Music ally Sophie, for example, put out one of the best albums of 2018, but her work with Madonna and Vince Staples hasn\u2019t exactly slayed the charts. When the 2015 Sophie-produced Charli XCX single \u201cVroom Vroom\u201d went big on TikTok, it was like a prophecy fulfilled: The tune had captured the attention-strained, jokey, energy-drink vibe of that platform before it even existed.\n\nPC Music\u2019s work, in fact, usually reads as satire of the desperation and false cheer that rule tech-pop culture. Its best songs are the ones in which humankind seems endangered, its voices trapped in a ZIP file while eager-to-please Siri-like bots take their place. The collective\u2019s collaborations with flesh-and-blood singers like Carly Rae Jepsen thus sometimes feel wrong: You\u2019re not sure who the joke\u2019s on. The sardonic Charli XCX makes for a better team member; she\u2019s game for her pouty voice to be treated less as an instrument than a sample. Still, the tension between songwriterly communication and sonic mischief can be awkward. She never lands a square triumph of a song on Charli, though she gets close enough that the interesting factor makes up for it.\n\nThe album starts jarringly with \u201cNext Level Charli\u201d issuing a monotonous rallying cry for some species that has less-sensitive ears than our own. It features the signature Charli/Cook ingredients\u2014video-poker synths over a simple beat with warbly and watery vocals\u2014but every knob is turned so high that what\u2019s conjured is the after-party migraine rather than the pre-party adrenaline rush. Luckily, Charli follows with \u201cGone,\u201d an agreeably swirling anthem about that very 2019 sentiment of hating the party you\u2019re at. The bridge goes bonkers in the style of Aphex Twin, but the biggest breakthrough is in the fun, lyrical mouthfeel: \u201cThey\u2019re making me lo-oa\u2014oathe,\u201d Charli and the guest frontwoman of Christine and the Queens croon.", "description": "The songwriter\u2019s cybernetic new album Charli is a complement to the mainstream, not an invasion of it.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/Charli_XCX_2019_credit_Marcus_Cooper/facebook.jpg?1568389580", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
