Retail, software and computer services and media were the worst-performing sectors.", "description": "Professional services giant EY found that firms listed in London made 235 such cautions between January and September - the largest year-to-date figure since 2008.", "authors": ["William Turvill For The Financial Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
