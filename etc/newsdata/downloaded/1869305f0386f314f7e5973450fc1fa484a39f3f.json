The payments were for things including speaking fees, consulting, meals, gifts, travel, and royalties.\n\nWhile thousands of doctors have made $100,000 or more, more than 2,500 received $500,000 or more in the five-year period\u2014and those payments do not include royalties. More than 700 received at least $1 million.\n\nThe data comes from the first full five-year period of the federal Open Payments Initiative, a part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act that requires companies to disclose such payments. The idea behind the initiative was that such transparency might dissuade industry payments to physicians, which research has shown time and again influences prescribing and care practices.\n\nBut researchers and industry watchers see little change in spending levels and the number of physicians accepting payments.\n\n\u201cIt makes me wonder whether patients are using this information or whether physicians are even aware this information is out there,\u201d Dr. Joseph Ross, a professor of medicine and public health at Yale who has studied pharmaceutical marketing, told ProPublica. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\nIn an email to ProPublica, a spokesperson for the industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) defended the continued practice, writing:\n\nIt is not necessarily a negative that the numbers have remained generally flat over the past five years\u2026 That statistic appears to be consistent with companies\u2019 belief that their interactions with physicians have been and remain legitimate, even when subjected to sunshine.\n\nThe data also includes how much drug makers have spent to promote specific drugs to physicians over the five years. In 2018, drug makers shelled out $17.9 million to promote blood thinner Xarelto to doctors, $12.6 million to promote diabetes drug Farxiga, and $12.2 million to promote the immune-suppressive drug Humira. Those figures do not include money for research funding or royalties.\n\nA 2017 analysis on the drugs that prompted the most physician-promotion payments from doctors found that they tended to be drugs that are \u201cless likely than top selling and top prescribed drugs to be effective, safe, affordable, novel, and represent a genuine advance in treating a disease.\u201d", "description": "The payouts aren't changing despite newer disclosure requirements.", "authors": ["Beth Mole"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-148302547-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
