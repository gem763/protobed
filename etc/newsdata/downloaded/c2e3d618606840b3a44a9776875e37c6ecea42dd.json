It has little to do with the war against the so-called Islamic State, the ostensible purpose of the U.S. in Syria, and far more to do with a confrontation against an entirely different adversary: Iran.\n\nThe Oct. 6 phone call between presidents Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a prelude to the betrayal of the U.S.\u2019 Syrian Kurdish partners, prompted a highly confusing U.S. withdrawal from the Syrian northeast, one that\u2019s been misunderstood as a full withdrawal from Syria. Instead, according to a knowledgeable U.S. official not cleared to speak with reporters, hundreds of U.S. special operators and general-purpose troops have pulled back to al-Tanf. For however long they remain in Syria\u2014now that the Turks have invaded and the Kurds have turned to the Syrian government and its Russian patrons for protection, the U.S. presence may be untenable\u2014al-Tanf and the 55-kilometer \u201cexclusion zone\u201d surrounding it will be where they operate.\n\nIn a coda for the war, the missions U.S. forces can execute from al-Tanf are unclear. Along with a proxy force the U.S. has trained for years at al-Tanf, the Syrian Arab Magahwir al-Thawra, the U.S. occasionally intercepts ISIS fighters. But officials familiar with the area note that the base is far from where the bulk of ISIS is.\n\nWhatever military utility al-Tanf has in 2019 has more to do with a conflict with Iran. The base is positioned along a crucial highway stretching east into Iraq, and onward to Iran, and west toward Damascus. Thwarting Iran and its proxies from accessing the Mediterranean coast, bringing weapons and money along the way, has been an undeclared priority of hawkish U.S. officials in both the Obama and Trump administrations, as well as regional allies like Israel.\n\n\u201c Al-Tanf has no obvious military purpose. \u201d \u2014 The International Crisis Group's Sam Heller\n\n\u201cAl-Tanf grew as a sop to Jordan, grew because Donald Trump delegated authorities to ground commanders, and was repurposed as an anti-Iran thing, despite the very real fact that Iranian aircraft fly over it on a routine basis,\u201d said Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.\n\n\u201cAl-Tanf has no obvious military purpose,\u201d added Sam Heller of the International Crisis Group. \u201cThe real justification is, to my knowledge, denying the Syrian government and its Iranian ally access to the neighboring al-Tanf/al-Walid border crossing with Iraq. That blocks a key trade route that would better integrate Syria with its regional surroundings and help government-held Syria get on a more stable economic footing, which some in DC believe would diminish U.S. leverage to force a political resolution to the war.\u201d\n\nSeveral former Trump administration officials, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton and cashiered Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have wanted to use the U.S. presence in Syria to confront Iran. That has discomfited Pentagon officials who wanted to focus on combatting ISIS, but some of them have conceded the utility al-Tanf has for frustrating Iran.\n\n\u201cOur presence, our development of partners and relationships down here does have an indirect effect on some malign activities that Iran and their various proxies and surrogates would like to pursue down here,\u201d the former Central Command commander, now-retired Army Gen. Joseph Votel, said in Oct. 2018, the first time al-Tanf was opened to reporters.\n\nSimilarly, Trump does not share his former aides\u2019 expansive goals in Syria. But he\u2019s ordered a 14,000-troop escalation in the Mideast over the past six months, aimed at threatening the Iranians. Accordingly, it\u2019s conspicuous that al-Tanf is what remains of the U.S. in Syria.\n\n\u201cIt is everything wrong with Trump\u2019s war in Syria,\u201d said Stein. \u201cThe fact that it will be the last American enclave in Syria is more evidence of how Iran myopia has poisoned U.S. objectives in the region.\n\nIt\u2019s also been a scene of conflict. As Syrian government forces advanced on southeastern Syria, the U.S. and Russia negotiated the \u201cexclusion zone\u201d near al-Tanf to keep everyone\u2019s armies separate. That didn\u2019t stop U.S. warplanes from firing on an Iranian convoy near the base last September, killing six Syrians and an Iranian. These days, however, sources familiar with the area say the Iranian-controlled forces typically just route around the exclusion zone, rendering the base dubiously effective at its ancillary, undeclared mission.\n\nAl-Tanf is just a few miles away from the squalor of a refugee camp called Rukban, where at least 10,000 people live without access to running water and children die from exposure. The U.S. is not interested in their fate. At the Aspen Security Forum in the summer, Amb. Jim Jeffrey, one of the Trump administration\u2019s most senior Syria policymakers, denied responsibility for Rukban. Administering humanitarian aid from al-Tanf, he argued, would risk making the U.S. presence look like it would last \u201cforever.\u201d\n\nBut neither mission creep, strategic incoherence, inhumanity, nor disutility has ever been sufficient to stop a drifting U.S. war. Al-Tanf is a survivor. It\u2019s endured earlier rumors of closure and Russian threats to assault it. \u201cDespite the dubious rationale for remaining in al-Tanf, and the resource drain of securing the base,\u201d said Heller, \u201cit's possible the U.S. presence could persist indefinitely.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials insist there will still be surveillance flights over Syria, so as to monitor whatever remains of the ISIS prisons the Kurds maintained before Turkey\u2019s incursion. For the time being, those flights are focused on protecting U.S. troops from surprise attack. Whatever overflight the U.S. stages from al-Tanf has to operate in the collapsing window of Syrian airspace not controlled by Syrian, Russian, and Turkish forces.\n\n\u201c Far from being a feather in the cap of American power, it is a dumb waste of resources... it exists only because the Trump administration has convinced itself that [its policy] is something other than a set of talking points. \u201d \u2014 The Foreign Policy Research Institute's Aaron Stein\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much there will be. Administration officials and senior military officers are piecing together a post-drawdown Syria policy that can keep pace with\u2014and be undone by\u2014presidential tweets.\n\nOn a trip to the Middle East that began this weekend, Defense Secretary Mark Esper was unsure whether the U.S. will stage anti-ISIS raids or strikes in Syria from Iraq, where most of the drawdown forces are headed, pending discussion with regional allies. On Monday, after Trump tweeted that U.S. forces have \u201csecured the oil\u201d in northeastern Syria, Esper revealed that now the Pentagon is considering additional plans to do just that, though securing oil and not human beings may not go over well with incensed Kurds who are pelting U.S. convoys with stones and fruit, to say nothing of the U.S. adversaries filling the void left behind by the U.S. departure.\n\nFor now, what remains for the U.S. is al-Tanf, however much it calls into question the logic of this residual American presence. \u201cFar from being a feather in the cap of American power, it is a dumb waste of resources,\u201d Stein said, \u201cin need of constant protection from hostile action, and it exists only because the Trump administration has convinced itself that [its policy] is something other than a set of talking points designed to mask the aim of collapsing the Islamic Republic.\u201d", "description": "As the Pentagon scrambles to keep pace with Trump\u2019s Syria tweets, its final outpost in the Syrian desert is a base in search of a purpose.", "authors": ["Spencer Ackerman", "Senior Nat L Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571682209/191021-ackerman-syria-tease_f9skds", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
