It was truly appalling and they both now face time in prison as a consequence.\u201d\n\nPolice launched an investigation in February after officers became aware that a graphic image of the post-mortem of Sala was appearing on social media.\n\nThey raided the officers of the closed circuit TV firm which held the out-of-hours contract to monitor the mortuary and discovered that the company\u2019s director, Bray and another member of staff, Ashford, had illegally accessed the footage.\n\nBray had taken photographs of the footage on her mobile phone and then sent the pictures to another person on Facebook Messenger, police said. Evidence showed Bray had also taken pictures of another body in the mortuary.\n\nBray, who pleaded guilty in August to three counts of computer misuse and perverting the course of justice, was jailed for 14 months at Swindon Crown Court.\n\nAshford, who admitted three counts of computer misuse, was sentenced to five months in prison.", "description": "Two workers from a British CCTV firm were jailed on Monday for accessing graphic mortuary footage, later circulated on social media, of the body of the late Argentine soccer player Emiliano Sala, who was killed in a plane crash in January.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432987095&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1AU", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
