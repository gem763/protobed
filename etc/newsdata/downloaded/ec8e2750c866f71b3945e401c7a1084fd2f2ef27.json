However, the agreement doesn't include the quotas or price controls that many American growers wanted, Bloomberg said.\n\nThe president may have backed down for one big reason. Hiking the cost of bringing Mexican tomatoes into the US would have hit demand and hurt Mexico's agricultural industry, potentially driving farmworkers to cross the northern border in search of employment.\n\n\"If we didn't have sales to the US, then people would need to migrate to the US to look for other options, because they don't have them here,\" Salvador Garc\u00eda, a Mexican tomato boss who participated in US-Mexico trade talks, told Bloomberg.\n\n\"I need to go wherever the work is,\" Lorenzo Ju\u00e1rez, a Mexican farmworker who picked strawberries as an undocumented immigrant in California around six years ago, told Bloomberg. Higher tomato tariffs \"might mean returning to the north,\" he added.\n\nThe proposed duties risked reversing the current trend of net emigration. The number of undocumented Mexicans living in the US dropped from 6.9 million in 2007 to 4.9 million in 2017, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nSlapping tariffs on Mexican tomatoes could have sparked significant migration given the size of the industry and America's importance as a customer. Mexico's tomato industry provides work for around 1.5 million people including pickers, truckers, and restaurant owners, Bloomberg said.\n\nThe US imported more than $2 billion worth last year \u2014 more than half of its yearly tomato production, Bloomberg said.\n\nAs a result, a dropoff in US demand could have a big impact. Given Trump's militant opposition to undocumented Mexican immigrants and a looming election, the president may have decided against making a perceived problem worse.", "description": "Donald Trump's decision to ditch provisional tariffs on Mexican tomatoes may have prevented an onrush of undocumented immigrants to the US, according to B...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d7110ff2e22af0a8267cae3-2000/rtx2nqul.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
