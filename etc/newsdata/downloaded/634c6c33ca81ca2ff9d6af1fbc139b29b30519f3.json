He dismembered their bodies and partially consumed them before disposing of their remains in bags in ponds, claims the authority.\n\nThe statement says the men were discarded in a river channel and a lake in the district of the city of Arkhangelsk, in northern Russia.\n\n(Image: Sledcom)\n\n(Image: Investigative Committee of Russia)\n\nThe killings took place between March 2016 and March 2017, in various parts of the territory near the city.\n\nThe statement from the local authorities - translated from Russian - says: \"In addition to cannibalism, the accused regularly killed and ate cats, dogs, and other small animals and birds, whose bone remains were found in packages along with human ones.\"\n\nIt goes on to assert that the man has been considered mentally healthy after a medical examination.\n\n(Image: Investigative Committee of Russia)\n\n(Image: Investigative Committee of Russia)\n\nMeanwhile the alleged charges assert that the accused began to live in the apartment of one of his victims, while telling the parents of the killed man that their son had gone to work in another city.\n\n\"He confidently put forward the same version to police officers who were looking for the missing person,\" says the Russian statement.\n\nThis shows the \"special impudence, unscrupulousness and composure of the accused\", added the translated statement.\n\n(Image: Investigative Committee of Russia)\n\n(Image: Investigative Committee of Russia)\n\nThis, along with the fact the other two victims had no relatives, meant that the \"disappearance or loss of family ties\" was not \"announced\" and people did not suspect foul play. It therefore took a long time to identify the victims.\n\nThe local authority statement added: \"Considering that parts of the corpses were found fragmentary, which, in practice, excluded the possibility of their identification, they were only able to establish their identities thanks to a large number of various complex examinations.\"\n\nRussia's Investigative Committee, their version of the FBI, also released a video clip of the man under arrest.", "description": "Russian authorities have charged a man after human and animal remains were found near the northern city of Arkhangelsk", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Sledcom", "Investigative Committee Of Russia"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20752246.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Russian-cannibal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
