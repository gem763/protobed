Manufacturers argue they provide a safer alternative to people who would light up anyway. Critics contend that growing publicity is more likely to introduce people who never would have smoked, especially kids, to nicotine \u2014 a highly addictive chemical.\n\nThe evidence differs internationally. While U.S. government officials have warned of an \u201cepidemic\u201d of youth e-cig use, statistics from the U.K. suggest most British vapers had already been smokers.\n\nWhile regulators have been more open to advertising vape pens and heated tobacco devices, manufacturers are still legally barred from promoting the idea that the new technology is less harmful than regular cigarettes.\n\nSome recent tobacco marketing has stressed a product\u2019s ability to deliver on the pleasures of smoking, such as flavor. BAT\u2019s spot for U.S. television starts out like a promo for green energy, with images of wind turbines and urban parks, before boasting that its Vuse Alto vape creates \u201cwhat smokers really want: real draw, real taste, real satisfaction.\u201d\n\nThe specificity of online data makes it easier to cut off messages to those who shouldn\u2019t be receiving them.\n\nMany public health activists fear that letting Big Tobacco rebuild its reputation marks a dangerous step backward after the decades-long fight to restrict tobacco advertising. Rules in countries like France and the U.K. limit the types of branding and decoration that may appear on cigarette packs.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the tobacco industry is in the business of addiction,\u201d said Jo Cranwell, who researches the industry\u2019s marketing techniques at the University of Bath in the U.K and as a partner with the Bloomberg Philanthropies-backed industry watchdog Stopping Tobacco Organizations and Products. \u201cAt the end of the day, all they\u2019re interested in is their business and maintaining it.\u201d\n\nBAT and PMI say their advertising choices follow three criteria: Campaigns should be targeted at adults and at existing smokers \u2014 and they must be legal. And they\u2019re asking for more latitude.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that more smokers would give up cigarettes if there were greater freedoms to communicate and accurately inform about better alternatives,\u201d said PMI\u2019s vice president for strategic and scientific communications, Moira Gilchrist, in a written response\n\n#Adultsonly?\n\nBAT and PMI are eager hirers of social media influencers to promote their smokeless products, often through outside agencies. They say social media\u2019s ability to carefully select an ad campaign\u2019s audience has made it easier to target adults.\n\n\u201cCompanies have an extraordinary ability to say, \u2018All these people are exactly who you need, and that person isn't,\u2019 and that person then gets taken off the database,\u201d said Cleverly.\n\nThe specificity of online data makes it easier to cut off messages to those who shouldn\u2019t be receiving them, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure that we know exactly who that person's followers are,\u201d and hire just those influencers with adult fanbases.\n\nHowever, some anti-smoking groups, like the U.S.-based Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids and the U.K.\u2019s Action on Smoking and Health say Big Tobacco\u2019s social media efforts have at times targeted young people.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Advertising Standards Authority is currently investigating BAT following accusations from the groups that the company is reaching young people using \u201cconcerted, consistent and systematic approach\u201d to online promotion of its Vype e-pen.\n\nThe groups pointed to the campaign\u2019s use of hashtags around pop culture events and stars, like #Oscars2019, #bohemianrhapsody and #LilyAllen.\n\nCleverly expressed confidence that the government watchdog will exonerate BAT. He said the hashtag campaigns were based on market research showing that the hashtags reached adults. Social media followers of actor Rami Malek, for example, star of the film \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" were overwhelmingly adult, he said. \u201cWe don't just chuck stuff out there and cross our fingers.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, cigarette brand Marlboro paid millions to splash its name across the chassis of Formula 1 race cars.\n\nBoth BAT and, more recently, PMI have come under fire for using very young models on Instagram in ads for heated tobacco products. PMI said it was suspending its \u201cproduct-related influencer campaigns\u201d globally after Reuters reported on the use of models the newswire characterized as \u201crail-thin young women who revel in the high life\u201d to promote the company\u2019s IQOS device.\n\nReuters found breaches of PMI\u2019s internal guidelines that prohibit the use of models who are or appear to be under the age of 25.\n\nNeither of the officials from BAT or PMI could point to instances when they spiked their own campaign because it was reaching the wrong audience, without it first being highlighted in the media.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen any worrisome levels of unintended use either among youth or non-smokers and so have not needed to stop any of our activities,\u201d said PMI\u2019s Gilchrist in her statement.\n\nNo filters\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum from social media targeting, tobacco companies are taking advantage of looser restrictions to promote smokeless products in public places where cigarette ads aren\u2019t allowed.\n\nWith one of the highest smoking rates in Europe, Romania is a popular testing ground for alternative tobacco devices. Supporters argue that\u2019s where the population can benefit most from less harmful nicotine products. PMI\u2019s IQOS and BAT\u2019s Glo products are sold from machines in bars.\n\nPMI hosts a 500-square-meter art space in a Bucharest mansion, known as Qreator, which has rooms devoted to fashion, theater and music projects, as well as a \u201cmeeting place for smoker adults who want to discover [IQOS].\u201d\n\nBut the big complaint from public health advocates are public billboards in places like malls that are popular with children and teens.\n\n\u201cAnyone can understand to whom such an ad is addressed,\u201d said Raed Arafat, a doctor and the head of the emergency situations department at the Romanian ministry of internal affairs, in a Facebook post featuring a picture of an ad for Glo at Bucharest\u2019s Mall Baneasa. \u201cI do not think a smoker is interested in what color the device has, whether it is black, gold or pink. But for teenagers and children this can be attractive.\u201d\n\nArafat joined calls to close what activists call a loophole in Romanian law that allows ads for heat-not-burn devices.\n\n\u201cThe most important policy to prevent children taking up smoking is preventing them from being exposed to advertising,\u201d said Ramona Brad, project director of the 2035 Tobacco-Free Romania Initiative, noting that promotions for heat-not-burn products are now ubiquitous in restaurants, malls and convenience-store counters in Romania. \u201cOne wouldn\u2019t do advertising in public spaces if it\u2019s only meant for adults.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere we're allowed to advertise, why wouldn't we advertise?\u201d \u2014 Simon Cleverly, group head of corporate affairs at BAT\n\nCleverly said BAT sticks to \u201cfactual\u201d messaging about the device in public ads where they have no control over the audience, but, indeed, they have no intention of passing up legal marketing opportunities just because kids might be exposed.\n\n\u201cWhere we're allowed to advertise, why wouldn't we advertise?\u201d he said. \u201cWe're a business, and these are really important for our business. But we believe for the first time that actually, from a public health perspective, we're all on the same side.\u201d\n\nLegal lines remain blurry, however; and the industry\u2019s reputation remains tarnished.\n\nIn the 1990s, cigarette brand Marlboro paid millions to splash its name across the chassis of Formula 1 race cars, hoping to draw a macho connection between the thrilling danger of auto racing and the health risks of cigarettes. Internal documents later revealed the strategy worked especially well in Japan, enticing many young men to take up smoking.\n\nBecause of that history, the recent BAT and PMI Formula 1 branding drew the ire of Australian regulators, even though neither explicitly hyped their products. Both teams dropped the logos for the Australian race that opened the 2019 season.\n\nLate last month, Ferrari said it would stop using its Formula 1 car emblazoned with \u201cMission Winnow,\u201d PMI\u2019s cryptic campaign stressing its commitment to innovation, for races in Canada and France.\n\nBAT is forging ahead with its slogan, \u201cA better tomorrow\u201d \u2014 except at a race in Bahrain, where rules are more relaxed. There, the name of BAT\u2019s new e-cig \u201cVype\u201d appeared emblazoned across the car.\n\nCarmen Paun contributed reporting from Bucharest.", "description": "Ads from cigarette companies are reappearing on race cars, television and public billboards \u2014 as well as social media.", "authors": ["Sarah Wheaton", "Katie Jennings", "Carmen Paun"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tobacco-Advert-_FinalV1webcrop-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-26"}
