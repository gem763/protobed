Rodriguez, a longtime Harris confidant who held the same job on her 2016 Senate campaign, will continue to oversee the budget while focusing on longer-term initiatives.\n\nThe campaign did not start holding regular senior staff meetings until September \u2014 nine months after launching \u2014 leading to a lack of coordination across departments. At one point, aides said, Harris hired executive coaches for senior campaign management to cope with the problems \u2014 a move viewed internally as a recognition of their collective inexperience.\n\nAides point to scheduling bottlenecks occurring among the campaign\u2019s three top inside decision-makers: Rodriguez, Maya Harris and Harris, who has a reputation as a micromanager. Harris\u2019 outside consultants, Ace Smith and Sean Clegg, partners with Rodriguez and Butler at the San Francisco-based consulting firm SCRB, and ad man Jim Margolis, don\u2019t directly oversee campaign staff.\n\nMorning Score Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

It\u2019s unclear who will step in to serve as Harris\u2019 Senate chief of staff.\n\n\u201cWe continue to grow our organization as we enter the fourth quarter, and it has always been the plan to bring on additional management to oversee an expanded staff. As we double our organizers in Iowa and South Carolina and expand our digital team, we're in a strong position to execute our plan and win the nomination,\u201d said Rodriguez in a statement.\n\nHarris is also recalibrating her digital operation as she struggles to break out of the middle of the presidential pack. While she\u2019ll still use Authentic Campaigns for digital ad buying, other functions \u2014 including content production, email, video, graphics and other work \u2014 are moving in-house. Harris\u2019 campaign had already brought in Shelby Cole, the top digital aide on Beto O'Rourke\u2019s Texas Senate run, from Authentic earlier this year.\n\nHer heavy reliance on the high-dollar fundraising and recent difficulty in the digital fundraising space speak to broader structural dynamics in the campaign. Harris\u2019 decision to run as a pragmatist rather than appealing more forcefully to the party\u2019s progressive wing \u2014 combined with slumping debate and campaign trail performances since mid-summer \u2014 have affected her ability to gain traction with small-dollar donors.\n\nHarris, who as a result spent much of the third quarter raising money at private events, is trying to refocus her campaign around Iowa, where aides say she needs a top-three finish to claw back into contention. She\u2019s nearly doubling the size of her Iowa operation, from 65 to 120 staffers, opening new offices and planning weekly visits to the state.\n\nThe strategy corresponds with a more direct contrast with her top Democratic opponents. Harris has said in recent remarks that Americans aren\u2019t keen to \u201cinflame the ideological battles in our nation,\u201d nor are they excited to \u201claunch a nostalgia campaign to retread mindsets and goals from decades past.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Harris has been working to quiet persistent doubts about her own electability by pointing to earlier campaigns when she was underestimated only to storm back in the late stages of the contests.\n\n\u201cI heard it when I ran for district attorney and people said, \u2018They\u2019re not going to be ready for you. No one like you has done it before,\u2019\u201d she said at a recent stop in Iowa.\n\nHarris bluntly offered that the reduced expectations about her in the past were \u201cbased on race, based on gender and based on what people expect and what they think about who can do what,\u201d she added. \u201cI didn\u2019t listen. And the people didn\u2019t listen, either. And we won.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e5/36/34aeda3d4f76ad12f5b6162095b1/190926-kamala-harris-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
