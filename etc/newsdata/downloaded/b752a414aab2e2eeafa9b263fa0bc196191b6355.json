With the right raincoat, they can spend time outdoors, no matter what the weather.\n\nIf you want something to withstand more than a light shower, make your raincoat of choice is fully waterproof, not just showerproof.\n\nBetter still, find a coat that is quick drying and look out for adjustable cuffs and well-fitting hoods.\n\nConsider how much warmth you\u2019ll need from the coat \u2013 is it just a layer of protection against the rain or does it need to help keep them toasty when it turns colder?\n\nAnd think about how bulky it is, especially if you just want something to keep in your bag so you\u2019re not caught short.\n\nDo you need something cheap and cheerful for the odd day out or a more technical coat, for example, if you like camping or getting out for walks whatever the weather?\n\nReflective strips can be useful to keep them safe around busy roads.\n\nWe've found something for every child in our roundup to help you protect them from the elements.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

This top-quality, lightweight, hand-me-down-worthy unisex jacket with reflective logo isn\u2019t just waterproof \u2013 it\u2019s windproof and breathable too, so it will do for everything from school runs to mountain walks. The hood is detachable and adjustable, so it never falls over the eyes, and there\u2019s a storm flap and quick-dry lining. And it\u2019s available in several colours. Ages 8-16 years.\n\nBuy now\n\nPolarn O. Pyret children\u2019s frog hood raincoat: \u00a335, Polarn O. Pyret\n\nAnother one from a Scandinavian brand \u2013 this time Swedish \u2013 this two-tone green coat was a big hit among our little testers. It\u2019s got waterproof fabric, welded seams, elasticated cuffs and a zip to do it up, all of which stop the raindrops finding their way in. Plus, it has a reflective front and back so they\u2019re always visible even on the darkest of days. Parents like the fact that it\u2019s washable at 40 degrees, while kids love the frog character hood. Ages 1-6 years.\n\nBuy now\n\nTretorn kids packable rain set: \u00a355, Tretorn\n\nThis stands out for weighing practically nothing and including trousers made from the same lightweight PVC-free PU. Also available in pink, it\u2019s got a sporty look with ventilation yoke so kids don\u2019t feel constricted, and when it\u2019s not raining they can remove the hood. The trousers have an elasticated waistband and ankles, with draw cord to keep them secure. And when you turn the side pocket in, you get a bag to store the lot in so you\u2019re never caught short without it. Age 2-14.\n\nBuy now\n\nBerghaus kids carrock 3-in-1 waterproof jacket: \u00a380, Berghaus\n\nThis waterproof, breathable jacket has great sealing and a particularly warm, cosy fleece inner coat that can be zipped out quickly and easily for warmer days. And the rollaway hood (which tucks in when not in use) means you can use it as a raincoat or regular jacket. We like the plain black colouring too \u2013 it makes it gender-neutral and a safe bet for kids of all ages, including older ones who often shun brighter designs. Ages 3-13 years.\n\nBuy now\n\nFrugi puddlebuster packaway jacket: \u00a313, Frugi\n\nSimply pack this away in its own pocket and pop it in your bag so you don\u2019t get caught short in unexpected showers. Made from recycled plastic bottles, this raincoat comes in three different designs \u2013 blue tractors, green frogs or, our favourite, blue puffins. With elasticated cuffs and fully taped seams, no water will trickle in and it ticks all the boxes for comfort, including no scratchy chins thanks to the zip fastening guard. The three piece hood is a good fit and there are reflective prints for when it gets dark. But it has no lining, so is best for warmer days. Ages 1-10 years.\n\nBuy now\n\nJack Wolfskin grivla: \u00a352, Jack Wolfskin\n\nAnother technical option that\u2019s aimed at kids that spend either serious amounts of time outside or time doing serious things outside, this exceptionally waterproof, windproof and breathable jacket for girls was inspired by Hannah Steing\u00e4sser, who\u2019s travelling the world to report on climate change. You can tell it\u2019s produced with the input of children as it\u2019s ultra-comfortable even during the most physical of exercise and has real attention to detail. Our testers also loved the soft, fold-out chin guard and well-placed pockets that you can reach even with a backpack on.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe North Face boys\u2019 zipline rain jacket: \u00a333, The North Face\n\nAvailable in green, red or blue, this has one of the softest linings we came across in our test. This jacket features Dry Vent technology that is waterproof, fully seam-sealed and breathable even in the most extreme weather conditions \u2013 just as you\u2019d expect from this outdoors brand. Our testers said not a drop of rain touched their skin and they told us it was ultra-comfy too, with just the right amount of stretch. Ages 5 to 16 years.\n\nBuy now\n\nMuddy Puddles puddle pac-a-mac: \u00a321.71, Muddy Puddles\n\nThis breathable, windproof, cheery-looking raincoat is made from recycled plastic bottles and packs into its own pocket, with a clip that can be fastened onto a rucksack, belt or buggy. There are two versions \u2013 this one, with a soft jersey lining, and a cheaper one without, all available in sizes 12 months to 12 years. While the yellow raindrop print is our favourite, we also like the navy puddle design and turquoise dandelion print. It\u2019s beautifully made and there\u2019s an all-in-one available too.\n\nBuy now\n\nJoJo Maman Bebe children\u2019s fisherman\u2019s jacket: \u00a336, JoJo Maman Bebe\n\nThis is a long-time bestseller from maternity wear and baby clothing retailer JoJo Maman B\u00e9b\u00e9. Available in three vibrant colours \u2013 pink, red and yellow \u2013 the soft, striped lining makes it both comfy and breathable, while the waxy outer finish protects children not just against rain but wind too. The zip is the type that never gets stuck, meaning little ones can often do it up themselves, and there\u2019s a Velcro storm flap and handy pockets. It washes beautifully at 30 degrees, but be warned it is on the heavier side so not an easy one to stuff in your bag just in case it rains. Ages 1-6 years.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Kids' raincoats\n\nThe Helly Hansen JR seven J jacket is our best buy because it ticks every box for keeping kids dry in even the heaviest of downfalls \u2013 and it looks good too, as well as being available in plenty of colours. Too expensive? The Muddy Puddles puddle pac-a-mac is a great practical option with a more affordable price-tag, with the benefit that you can \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 pack it up and keep it with you at all times. As for our little testers, it has to be said that the greatest gasps of joy went to the Marks & Spencer hooded sequin raincoat \u2013 the girls thought it was the best coat they\u2019d ever seen, bar none.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
