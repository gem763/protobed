That is concerning and Twitter must react.\n\nSince 20 September when small anti-government protests erupted in Egypt, president Sisi launched one of the largest crackdowns on dissent in years, arresting over 3,000 people.\n\nAt the same time, over 100 Twitter accounts of people who are critical of the government, including celebrated Egyptian author Ahdaf Soueif, were temporarily suspended by Twitter.\n\nThose who have been temporarily suspended from Twitter told The Independent they lost a significant chunk of followers when their accounts were finally reactivated.\n\nWhile their accounts are down (often at key times) they lose their public voice, and Twitter has offered no sufficient explanation.\n\nBecause of the timing, and people targeted, many believe it is part of a specific campaign by the Egyptian authorities or their supporters to silence critics.\n\nWhile no one knows exactly how and why the accounts were temporarily shut down, experts speculate regime supporters were able to get Twitter accounts suspended by ensuring enough profiles \u201creported\u201d those they wanted to target.\n\nTwitter will automatically suspend an account which has received a lot of complaints while it conducts an investigation.\n\nMarc Owen Jones, a professor at Doha\u2019s Hamad bin Khalifa University, said that over the course of his research on Yemen, people reported being \u201cmass followed\u201d by fake accounts to trigger a sudden suspension.\n\nThere are numerous other ways that people can reportedly ensure accounts are suspended by toying with the rules. All are concerning.\n\nTwitter should launch a thorough investigation into these cases and, if needed, re-examine their policies. Otherwise more people will be silenced.\n\nYours,\n\nBel Trew\n\nMiddle East correspondent", "description": "It\u2019s been called a storm in a teacup and an echo chamber but like Twitter or not, when traditional media is stifled, it is one of the few ways people can communicate their message to the outside world. \u00a0 It is a vital tool for journalists needing information from hard-to-reach places. \u00a0 For that reason, it is extremely vulnerable.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/21/12/cairo-protests.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
