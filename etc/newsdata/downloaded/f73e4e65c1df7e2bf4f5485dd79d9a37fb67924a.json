Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) tweeted that \u201cEvery person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and that starts with using correct pronouns.\u201d Presidential hopeful Juli\u00e1n Castro and squad member Rep.

My pronouns are she/her/hers. And I'll keep fighting to build an America where everyone feels seen and respected. #PronounsDay \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 16, 2019\n\nSomeone reminded us that it really is hard for some people, and can trigger anxiety or dysphoria. I\u2019m grateful to learn how to be more inclusive of people all genders. \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 16, 2019\n\nIt costs nothing to treat people with dignity and use their correct pronouns.\n\n\n\nAyanna: she/her/hers\n\n\n\nHappy #PronounsDay! https://t.co/d67Zr5ijE9 \u2014 Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (@RepPressley) October 16, 2019\n\nOther Democrats chimed in to tweet about pronouns as well. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) suggested that when in doubt, people should inquire about a person\u2019s pronouns. She said that \u201cPronouns aren\u2019t just about accuracy \u2013 they\u2019re about acceptance.\u201d\n\nHappy #PronounsDay from the proud parent of a non-binary kid.\n\n\n\nPronouns aren\u2019t just about accuracy \u2013 they\u2019re about acceptance. Not sure what pronouns to use? Ask politely! And when someone tells you their pronouns, use them. \u2014 Rep. Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal) October 16, 2019\n\nMy pronouns are he/him/his and I don\u2019t believe that any American should be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It\u2019s time we pass the Equality Act to protect (and respect) every American. #PronounsDay \u2014 Jeff Merkley (@JeffMerkley) October 17, 2019\n\nMy pronouns are she/her/hers.\n\n\n\nLet's commit to making all of our communities and spaces more inclusive for all people, and make sure everyone feels seen and respected every day. Happy #PronounsDay! \u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) October 16, 2019\n\nMy pronouns are he/him/his.\n\n\n\nOn #PronounsDay remember that words have power. It's important to be mindful and respectful of the humanity and identities of non-binary, trans, and gender non-conforming members of our diverse #LGBTQ+ community. https://t.co/iENddbaSRl \u2014 Mark Takano (@RepMarkTakano) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cInternational Pronouns Day began in 2018 and takes place on the 3rd Wednesday of October each year,\u201d according to pronounsday.org.\n\n\u201cInternational Pronouns Day seeks to make respecting, sharing, and educating about personal pronouns commonplace. Referring to people by the pronouns they determine for themselves is basic to human dignity. Being referred to by the wrong pronouns particularly affects transgender and gender nonconforming people. Together, we can transform society to celebrate people\u2019s multiple, intersecting identities,\u201d the website says.\n\nTownhall has previously noted the phenomenon of some Democrat presidential primary candidates including gender pronouns in their Twitter biographies.", "description": ".10/17/2019 21:07:57PM EST.", "authors": ["Alex Nitzberg", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/248/8afec7fd-f34f-4386-9d98-4191566cf5bc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
