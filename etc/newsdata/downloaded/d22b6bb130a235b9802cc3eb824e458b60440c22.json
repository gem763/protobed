He says he was unaware of the story about the trial and has made no further payments.\n\n'This was a single donation made more than 10 years ago,' the Prince told Sportsmail. 'It was made in good faith and represents a small portion of my annual charitable giving. That can't be a bad thing. I don't think it is relevant to anything any more.'\n\nWhile CAIR has been accused of ties to Islamic extremism, they have denounced violence, been praised for their civil rights work and attracted popular support amid US president Donald Trump's attempts to impose a Muslim travel ban.\n\nThe Saudi prince became involved with the Blades when the club were in League One in 2013\n\nPrince Abdullah bin Mosaad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud has been involved at Sheffield United since 2013, when he accepted an offer to buy half of the club \u2014 then in League One \u2014 on the agreement he would invest \u00a310million.\n\nHe fell out with co-owner Kevin McCabe and a power struggle led to the High Court earlier this year, when it was revealed the Prince had borrowed money for the Blades from Saleh bin Laden.\n\nThe Bin Ladens are a respected business family in Saudi Arabia and have long since disowned Osama Bin Laden, but the surname is synonymous in the west with Al-Qaeda and terrorism.\n\nPrince Abdullah, 54, is in the process of taking full control at Sheffield United\n\n'I get offended when the Bin Laden family is given a bad name,' said Prince Abdullah after the judge had ruled in his favour. 'Every family may have one black sheep but they are very respectable.'\n\nMcCabe must sell his half of the club, now in the Premier League, to Prince Abdullah for \u00a35m. Prince Abdullah must also buy from McCabe club properties, which include the stadium and training ground and are thought to be worth a total in excess of \u00a350m.\n\nThe court will reconvene on Monday when it will become clear whether McCabe plans to contest the ruling. Prince Abdullah has installed his son-in-law Prince Musa'ad bin Khalid bin Abdulrahman Al Saud as chairman of Sheffield United.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY MATT BARLOW: Sheffield United owner Prince Abdullah gave more than \u00a390,000 to a controversial Muslim civil rights group which divides opinion in the United States.", "authors": ["Matt Barlow For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/19/19504014-0-image-a-6_1570644209462.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
