'That usually means that some right wing outlet published something hateful.'\n\nRachel McKinnon, 37, won gold in the 35-39 age category sprint at the Masters Track World Championships in Manchester on Saturday. But on Monday she insisted her victory had been dampened by a flurry of 'hate messages' she'd been receiving directly on Instagram, Twitter and email\n\nMcKinnon later blamed Donald Trump Jr. of fueling the flames of hatred after he tweeted numerous times about her victory, and how he thought it was 'BS'\n\nAn hour later, McKinnon tweeted again, this time quote tweeting Donald Trump Jr.'s outburst against her victory.\n\n'You can never be woke enough!' The president's eldest son tweeted in response to a Town Hall article claiming McKinnon would not have qualified for the men's championships. 'Sorry to all female athletes who spent their lives mastering their games.'\n\nMcKinnon responded: 'Oh THIS explains the explosion of hate messages I'm getting!!'\n\nHours earlier, in a separate tweet, Trump Jr. also branded the idea of trans women being eligible to compete alongside female-born athletes as 'BS'.\n\n'This BS will destroy women's sports and everything so many amazing female athletes have worked their entire lives to achieve,' he blasted. 'I couldn't care less how you identify, but this isn't right.'\n\nWhen another Twitter user said that 'ultimate male privilege is men being able to dominate women's sports. All the gains women have made toward equality flushed,' Trump Jr. responded: 'It's funny because it's true. Sad.'\n\n'They're flooding my IG with hate speech,' McKinnon tweeted Monday afternoon. 'That usually means that some right wing outlet published something hateful.'\n\nBefore the race, McKinnon told Sky News: 'All my medical records say female. My doctor treats me as a female person, my racing licence says female, but people who oppose my existence still want to think of me as male.\n\n'There's a stereotype that men are always stronger than women, so people think there is an unfair advantage. By preventing trans women from competing or requiring them to take medication, you're denying their human rights.'\n\nWhen asked if it was possible that she had a physical advantage as a trans woman, she admitted that, 'Yes, it's possible. But there are elite track cyclists who are bigger than me.\n\n'There is a range of body sizes and strength, you can be successful with massively different body shapes\u2026 In many Olympic disciplines the gap in performance is bigger between first and eighth in a single sex event than it is between the first man and the first woman.'\n\nWhen another Twitter user said that 'ultimate male privilege is men being able to dominate women's sports. All the gains women have made toward equality flushed,' Trump Jr. responded: 'It's funny because it's true. Sad'\n\nOn Monday, McKinnon alluded to the idea her victory had been dampened by a slurry of 'hate messages' she'd been receiving directly on Instagram, Twitter and via email - the majority of which thundered a cis woman shouldn't be allowed to compete alongside female-born athletes\n\nOn Sunday, McKinnon accused fellow competitor, Dawn Orwick, who was cycling for the US, of refusing to touch her on the winners' podium, opting instead to hold her left arm behind her back.\n\nMcKinnon said: 'Third place, Kristen, wore my ''sport is a human right'' sticker as a sign of solidarity.\n\n'Second place kept her distance and put her hand behind her back as her own sign.\n\n'Signifying something like poor sportsmanship.'\n\nDailyMail.com has contacted Dawn Orwick for comment but she hasn't spoken out against McKinnon's win or made a comment about transgender athletes competing against women who were born female.\n\nOther women who have been beaten by McKinnon have also said she has an unfair advantage.\n\nAfter McKinnon won her first world record last year, third-place finisher, Jennifer Wagner, said losing to her was 'unfair'.\n\nMcKinnon hit back by pointing out that the pair have cycled against each other 13 times and McKinnon has only won twice.\n\nThe woman who placed third on Saturday, Danish cyclist Kirsten Herup Sovang, has said she fully supports McKinnon's win.\n\nTransgender cyclist, Rachel McKinnon (centre), who won her second world title on Saturday accused the woman in second place of 'poor sportsmanship' for refusing to link arms with her on the World Championship podium\n\nMcKinnon won gold in the 35-39 age category sprint at the Masters Track World Championships in Manchester on Saturday\n\nShe told MailOnline: 'Rachel McKinnon was the strongest woman in the competition, she won fair and square.\n\n'I strongly support women's rights and equality in all aspects - that is every woman no exceptions.\n\nAfter McKinnon won her first world record last year, third-place finisher, Jennifer Wagner (pictured), said losing to her was 'unfair'\n\n'I know she wasn't born a woman, but she is a woman now and she fulfils the demands for testosterone levels set to compete.'\n\nMcKinnon started her sports career after transitioning in 2012 and has been criticised ever since by pressure groups and top sportswomen. They say she has an 'unfair advantage' because her 6ft frame, inherited from when she was male, gives her more muscle mass.\n\nAmong her critics are pressure groups Fair Play for Women and Save Women's Sports, Martina Navratilova, an athlete who was beaten by McKinnon last year and a leading women's cyclist.\n\nTop British cyclist Victoria Hood also criticized McKinnon, saying that her transgender status gave her an unfair advantage against women who are born biologically female.\n\nShe said: 'The science is there. The science is clear \u2013 it tells us that trans women have an advantage.'\n\n'It is a human right to participate in sport. I don't think it's a human right to identify into whichever category you choose.'\n\nDr McKinnon announced she was transgender in 2012 and started competing in cycling events in 2015 - rapidly rising to the top of the sport.\n\nRachel McKinnon, 37, is pictured left alongside her fellow female competitors. She won gold in the 35-39 age category sprint at the Masters Track World Championships in Manchester on Saturday.\n\nMcKinnon started her sports career after transitioning in 2012 and has been criticized by pressure groups and top sportswomen.\n\nLast year she broke her first record at the 200m sprint at last year's UCI Masters World Track Cycling Championship and also won the event in the 35-44 age bracket.\n\nDr McKinnon responded to Ms Wood's comments with a statement that revealed they have never competed against each other.\n\n'We are either full and equal women, or not. We are'\n\nIn December last year Dr McKinnon clashed with women's tennis great Martina Navratilova who said that allowing transgender women to compete in sport against people born as women was 'insane' and 'cheating'.\n\nMcKinnon called her 'transphobic' and Navratilova responded: 'McKinnon has vigorously defended her right to compete, pointing out that, when tested, her levels of testosterone, the male hormone, were well within the limits set by world cycling's governing body.\n\nWhat titles has transgender Canadian cyclist Dr Rachel McKinnon won since her foray into the sport? McKinnon says she began competitive cycling before 2015. In the last four years she has risen to the top of the game and now holds two world records. According to McKinnon's Instagram, her first cycling win was in 2015 at the Rumble at Roebling Road race. In 2016 she won the Hincapie Greenville Spring races. In March 2016 she won the Sunshine Grand Prix. The next month she won the Dilworth Criterium. In June of 2016 she placed first in Johnson City Omnium Sunday Criterium. August 2016 saw McKinnon win the Crossroads Classic races. She came first in the North and South Carolina Regional Track Championships in August 2017. May 2018 saw her win first place in the Dick Lane velodrome Need for Speed sprints. In October 2018 McKinnon broke her first record at the 200m sprint at the UCI Masters World Track Cycling Championship and also won the event in the 35-44 age bracket. This year she defended that title at the Masters Track World Championships in Manchester and set a new record.\n\n'Nevertheless, at 6ft tall and weighing more than 14 stone, she appeared to have a substantial advantage in muscle mass over her rivals.'\n\nAfter last year's UCI Masters Track Cycling World Championships in Los Angeles, the third-place finisher, Jennifer Wagner, said losing to Dr McKinnon was 'unfair'.\n\nMcKinnon responded to point out that she and Wagner have raced 13 times in the past and Wagner beat her 11 times.\n\nShe said: 'At Masters Worlds, she beat me in the 500m TT. She beat me in six of seven races at the 2017 Intelligentsia Cup. In 2016 she beat me in all three Speed Week crits. She's won 11 of our 13 races.\n\n'And it's unfair? Excuse me?'\n\nIn March this year Paula Radcliffe, who has held the Women's World Marathon Record since 2003, said: 'There are absolutely probably hundreds of transgenders who want to take part in sport for all of the other benefits that it brings.\n\n'And all we're saying is: ''That's fine, but not elite sport''.'\n\nMcKinnon then accused Radcliffe of spreading 'irrational fear'.\n\nOlympic swimmer Sharron Davies, who won silver in 1980, has also spoken out about transgender women being allowed to compete.\n\nShe said: 'I believe there is a fundamental difference between the binary sex you are born with and the gender you may identify as.\n\n'To protect women's sport, those with a male sex advantage should not be able to compete in women's sport.'\n\nMcKinnon hit back at Davies by calling her a transphobe and accusing her of 'sharing hate speech'.\n\nShe said: 'There is no debate to be had over whether trans women athletes have an unfair advantage: it's clear that they don't.\n\n'Since the Nov 2003 IOC policy openly allowing trans women to compete, not a single trans athlete has even qualified for the Olympics, let alone won a medal.'\n\nDame Kelly Holmes spoke out earlier this year against transgender women being allowed to compete against people who were born biologically female.\n\nAnd in response McKinnon tweeted to call her 'extremely transphobic' before blocking the two-time Olympic gold medalist on Twitter.\n\nHolmes responded by saying: 'If this subject is open to debate then why have I been blocked.\n\n'As far as I am concerned you are going about this in the wrong way.\n\n'Calling me transphobic is just ridiculous - far from it.\n\n'I have an opinion you don't like that's that!'\n\nBritish cyclist Victoria Hood continued her criticism of McKinnon by saying: 'The world record has just been beaten today by somebody born male, who now identifies as female, and the gap between them and the next born female competitor was quite a lot.\n\n'The world record was two tenths of a second. I know that doesn't sound like a lot but it is.\n\nDefending herself, McKinnon wrote: 'Many people claim to support trans women. But often they only support us until our lives impact them in any meaningful way.'\n\nMcKinnon (center) celebrates her gold medal on the podium with bronze medalist Kirsten Herup Sovang of Denmark and silver medalist Dawn Orwick (left) of the USA\n\nMcKinnon is pictured second from left with fellow athletes at the contest in Manchester\n\n'The gap between them and the next female competitor was four tenths, which to put into perspective in a sprint event like this, that would be 15m of the track, when sprint events are usually won by centimeters.'\n\nAs well as releasing a statement which pointed out that her new record was still behind several others set by athletes who were born biological females, she also took to Twitter.\n\nShe wrote: 'Many people claim to support trans women. But often they only support us until our lives impact them in any meaningful way.\n\n'In my case, people literally say they support trans women... but not in sport.\n\n'There can be no ''but''.\n\n'We are either full and equal women, or not. We are.'\n\nTransgender athletes have been allowed to compete in the Olympics since 2004 if they have undergone gender confirmation surgery and been on hormone therapy for two years.\n\nIn 2015, these rules were relaxed to remove the need for surgery and athletes must now have a testosterone level below 10nmol/L for at least 12 months prior to their first competition.\n\nAthletics' governing body the IAAF had the same requirements until last Monday when they announced that female athletes must have a testosterone level below 5nmol/L.\n\nMcKinnon, an assistant professor of philosophy, beat American Dawn Orwick for this year's title.\n\nShe set a new master's world record in the 200m time trial with a time of 11.649 seconds.\n\nMcKinnon's statement noted that her record in the 35-39 category is still behind the 40-44 age category record set by Carolien Van Herrikhuyzen and behind the 45-49 age age category of Gea Johnson.", "description": "Rachel McKinnon won gold in the 35-39 category sprint at the Masters Track World Championships in Manchester on Saturday. but in the days since she's been receiving 'hate messages' online.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/21/20052760-0-image-a-18_1571774680804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
