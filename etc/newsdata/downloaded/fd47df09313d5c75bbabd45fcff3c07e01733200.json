That represented a rise of \u00a38million on the amount his firms contributed to the Exchequer in 2017.\n\nThe billionaire inventor announced in January that he was moving the company's head office to low-tax Singapore.\n\nCleaning up: James Dyson, pictured at his technology centre, has seen sales soar to \u00a34.4bn\n\nBut in a boost for Britain, the firm said last night that its Wiltshire-based company Dyson James Group Limited (DJGL), which channels a significant proportion of the firm's global profits, would remain in Britain and pay taxes here.\n\nA Dyson spokesman said: 'Dyson James Group remains, and will remain, a British company.' He added that the move to Singapore 'will not impact the level of tax paid in the UK'.\n\nLast year, DJGL received \u00a380million of tax breaks from the Government for research and development. In Britain, it is investing in new laboratories and a robotics programme.\n\nHowever, more than 90 per cent of the firm's sales come from outside the UK.
