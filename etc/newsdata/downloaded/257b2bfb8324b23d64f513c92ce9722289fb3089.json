But fighters and veterans of the Free Syrian Army point out that they were also abandoned by Mr. Trump when he cut support to their force in 2017.\n\nNow, the Free Syrian Army, which has largely been marginalized in the conflict, sees a chance to regain lost territory in its struggle against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.", "description": "Turkey\u2019s plans to create a safe zone in northern Syria will increase the standing of its Syrian allies, who still dream of revolution.", "authors": ["Carlotta Gall"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/world/xxturkey-freesyrian-army1-copy/xxturkey-freesyrian-army1-copy-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
