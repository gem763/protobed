They Died Together in the Bronx.", "language": "en", "text": "An undated image provided by the New York Police Department shows Officer Brian Mulkeen. (New York Police Department via The New York Times)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Brian Mulkeen, 33, had a fascination with heroes and action movies. It did not surprise his friends when he became a New York City police officer, in an aggressive plainclothes unit focused on getting guns off the street.\n\nAntonio Lavance Williams, 27, a cook and a father of two from Binghamton, New York, had traveled to the Bronx to watch a televised prize fight with a friend. He was on probation for a drug conviction. He was also carrying a pistol, police say.\n\nThe lives of these two men, of similar build and close in age, collided \u2014 and ended \u2014 violently, just after midnight Sunday, Sept. 29.\n\nWilliams had everything to lose if he were arrested again, and when plainclothes officers tried to question him and another man outside the Edenwald Houses at 12:30 a.m., he ran. Mulkeen chased Williams, and they grappled in a dark courtyard behind a building.\n\nWithin minutes, both were mortally wounded by gunshots fired by officers. Mulkeen fired five times at Williams before being shot by his fellow officers. Williams\u2019 .32-caliber revolver was never fired.\n\nTen days later, police have released few details about the shooting. The department has not said why Mulkeen and his partners stopped Williams nor has it said when or how the officers learned Williams had a loaded gun. And it has not explained how Mulkeen ended up in the line of fire of his partners.\n\nTo some critics of police, the deaths of Mulkeen and Williams are emblematic of the risks inherent in the Police Department\u2019s strategy of sending plainclothes teams to search for people with guns. The units have been accused of being overzealous and of stopping people on questionable legal grounds.\n\nThe \u201cfriendly fire\u201d police death \u2014 the second time this year an officer has been killed by colleagues\u2019 bullets \u2014 has also led to calls for more training.\n\nAt Mulkeen\u2019s funeral, the police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill, said, \u201cOne person is responsible for Brian\u2019s death, and that\u2019s the person carrying a loaded and illegal gun that decided to run from the police.\u201d\n\nFrom Wall Street to the NYPD\n\nA decade ago, Brian Mulkeen was a financial adviser for Merrill Lynch, on Park Avenue.\n\nIt should have been a dream job; he had a degree in finance, and the salary was good. But after two years, he was unhappy, his friends and family said. He told friends his work lacked meaning. He wanted to become a police officer.\n\n\u201cHe took a huge pay cut to protect people in some of the worst neighborhoods in the city because he felt that call,\u201d said Daniel Tucker, a police sergeant in Salem, Massachusetts.\n\nMulkeen\u2019s pivot toward law enforcement seemed to be preordained. His grandfather had worked as a police detective, and two of his uncles were law enforcement officers, family said.\n\nHe resigned from Merrill Lynch in 2009 and moved to Orange County, New York. He picked up part-time work as a police dispatcher in the nearby town of Tuxedo and took a basic police training course, graduating with honors.\n\nMulkeen joined the New York Police Department in January 2013 and was assigned to a beat in the Bronx. Not long after, he was promoted to the borough\u2019s plainclothes anti-crime unit.\n\nHis commanding officer, Capt. Jeff Heilig, described Mulkeen as a \u201cgentle giant.\u201d \u201cWhen it was time to be on the street to be the police, he was. When it was time to be compassionate and have a heart, he did,\u201d he said.\n\nAs he settled into the job, Mulkeen started dating another officer in the Bronx, and the couple bought a fixer-upper in Yorktown Heights.\n\n\u201cThey just brought so much energy to the neighborhood,\u201d said Peter Pepdjonovic, 45, who lives on the same block. \u201cWe are all heartbroken here.\u201d\n\nTroubled, but Loved\n\nIf Mulkeen seemed driven, Antonio Lavance Williams appeared unmoored.\n\n\u201cHe had his troubles,\u201d said Manny Germosen, 25, who met Williams when they were children in Rockland, New York. \u201cBut he was always there for everybody.\u201d\n\nBorn in Washington, D.C., Williams spent his early years in Maryland before moving to New York state to live with his father. He attended North Rockland High School, where he met Tian Montanez. Their friendship turned romantic in 2015, and they had a son, who is now 2. Williams also had 4-year-old daughter from another relationship.\n\nWilliams came from \u201ca good family,\u201d Montanez said. His father, Shawn Williams, is a psychiatrist at a hospital, and his stepmother is a pediatrician, Montanez said.", "description": "NEW YORK -- Brian Mulkeen, 33, had a fascination with heroes and action movies.
