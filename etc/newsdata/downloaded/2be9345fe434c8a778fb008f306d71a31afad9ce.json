All became symbols of American freedom and prosperity that no amount of communist prohibitions could stop.\n\nToday, China poses a far more formidable yet lucrative challenge for some of the most famous icons of American culture \u2014 Apple, Disney, Lady Gaga, and lately the National Basketball Association. Selling the best of American creativity and talent increasingly demands submission to the views of the Communist Party as the price of admission.\n\nA recent furor that began with a single tweet by an N.B.A. executive in support of the Hong Kong protests has underscored the consequences of China\u2019s willingness to use its vast economic clout to police any political values that threaten the party\u2019s legitimacy or its policies.\n\nIt is the soft power of cultural vitality \u2014 as opposed to the hard, coercive power of military might \u2014 that makes the United States admirable in the eyes of much of the world, including China. The companies and organizations that produce much of this culture, however, have had to increasingly bend to China\u2019s political will under its leader, Xi Jinping, whose ambition is to make his country a counterweight, if not an alternative, to the United States.", "description": "The N.B.A. is the latest entertainment giant to incite nationalist anger in China, where political submission has become the price of admission to a market of 1.4 billion.", "authors": ["Steven Lee Myers", "Chris Buckley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/world/14chinapower1/00china-power-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
