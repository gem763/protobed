All of the victims\u2014LaQuetta Gunther, 45, Julie Ann Green, 34, and Iwana Patton, 35\u2014were found within a mile of each other in remote or wooded areas, and they had all suffered a .40-caliber gunshot wound to the head.\n\nGary Ray Bowles, \u2018I-95\u2019 Serial Killer Who Preyed on Gay Men, Executed in Florida\n\nPolice said that after his Sunday arrest, Hayes\u2019 DNA was linked to two victims who were murdered between 2005 and 2007. Authorities previously said two of the victims were discovered with semen on their bodies.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, we have not charged him yet...but we have linked him with forensic evidence to three of our murder victims,\u201d Daytona Beach Police Chief Craig Capri said Monday, calling Hayes a \u201cdisgusting serial killer.\u201d\n\nPolice say Hayes may also be responsible for the murder of 30-year-old Stacey Gage, who was found fatally shot behind a church in 2008, but authorities have yet to find forensic evidence tying him to the slaying.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know at this point in time if it\u2019s related. We\u2019re still investigating that,\u201d Capri said, adding that the multi-county investigation is \u201ca team effort to get closure for these families and get this killer off the streets.\u201d\n\nAuthorities previously said Gunther, a painter, was last seen leaving her friend\u2019s house on Dec. 24, 2005. Her partially nude body was found in an alleyway two days later, after she was shot \u201cexecution-style\u201d in the back of the head.\n\nFamily Sues Man They Say Left Their Daughter to Die on Florida Highway\n\nOn Jan. 14, 2006, her friend Julie Green was reportedly found dead in a ditch at a construction site. Green had also been shot in the back of the head. Patton, a 35-year-old nursing assistant, was killed a month later in a similar fashion, authorities said, and her body was discovered in a remote area off busy Daytona Boulevard.\n\nAuthorities said Monday that Hayes randomly targeted his victims, but it has been previously reported the three women all had a history of prostitution.\n\nHayes, who was a student at Bethune Cookman University, was interviewed by Daytona homicide detectives in 2006. Capri said he was questioned about purchasing a gun \u201caround the time of the murders\u201d but there was no \u201cphysical or forensic evidence\u201d linking him to the slayings.\n\nUnlike the other victims in Daytona, Bey was fatally strangled and found with multiple broken teeth and a broken jaw. Authorities believe she was dragged to the side of the highway where she was ultimately found on March 7, 2016, by utility workers.\n\nInvestigators said Hayes moved to Palm Beach County from Daytona Beach around the time of Bey\u2019s murder.\n\nNetflix\u2019s Most Dangerous Show Travels Where Only Psychopaths Dare\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement credited, DNA tests, genetic genealogy, and the diligence of local authorities for the arrest.\n\n\u201cKillers like Robert Tyrone Hayes are the reason genetic genealogy is so important to public safety,\u201d FDLE spokesman Troy Walker said on Monday. \u201cWithout genetic genealogy, predators like Mr. Hayes will continue to live in our neighborhoods, visit our parks, our libraries, restaurants, and go to our nightlife and entertainment districts to continue to hunt for victims.\u201d\n\nHayes, who was charged with first-degree murder, was denied bail at his initial court appearance Monday. It is not immediately known if he has a lawyer.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
