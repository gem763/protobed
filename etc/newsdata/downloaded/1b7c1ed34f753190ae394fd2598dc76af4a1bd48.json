She was pretty emotional.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long, long journey for me and her.\u201d\n\nDonna, 53, still works 12-hour shifts at a police call centre and gave Kyle strong guidance through his life.\n\nSo strong that Kyle reckons she\u2019s even tougher than the England rugby coach Eddie Jones.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou think Eddie\u2019s a tough taskmaster? Mama Sinckler, mate. I tell you, she put me in my place.\u201d\n\nAt Graveney School, a state school in Wandsworth, South London, there was no rugby team until Kyle set one up and asked teacher Stacia if she\u2019d coach it.\n\nKyle still texts Stacia before each game, and still calls her \u201cMiss\u201d.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nStacia said: \u201cIf anyone wants to know Kyle\u2019s true character they should have seen his reaction if any of the other kids said anything about the fact that he had a female coach. If you heard how protective he was about me, that shows somebody\u2019s true character.\u201d\n\nDonna kept her son busy with sport to keep him from the gang violence in Furzedown, South London.\n\nKyle said: \u201cWhen I was a kid I had rugby, football and cricket. I did kick boxing, weightlifting, I was always busy.\u201d\n\nDonna took eight-year-old Kyle, dressed in a full Man U kit, for rugby training with Battersea Ironsides.\n\nKyle said: \u201cWe\u2019d struggle to get 15 players. We\u2019d be borrowing players from the other team to play for us.\n\n\u201cIn this current climate, especially in South London, a lot of kids don\u2019t have that opportunity. That\u2019s why there are a lot of things happening with knife crime and stuff.\n\n\"They\u2019re just bored. They haven\u2019t got anything to do. One guy from school, the other day, he died. He opened his front door, got shot in the face. It\u2019s just crazy.\u201d\n\nKyle went to fee-paying Epsom College for sixth form on a scholarship, but Stacia says he proves top rugby union players can come from outside public schools, and from ethnic minorities.\n\n(Image: World Rugby via Getty Images)\n\nShe said: \u201cThere are not many black people playing rugby union at the top level in this country. We should be using Kyle as a role model.\u201d\n\nBack at Kyle\u2019s childhood home, neighbours remember him fondly.\n\nRhamona Greaves said: \u201cHe made it on to the team, the Harlequins, so I invited him round for tea.\n\n\"It was a good job I bought two chickens as he had a whole big massive roast chicken all to himself.\n\n\u201cI gave it to him because I knew that he can eat \u2013 I just didn\u2019t realise how much he bloody ate.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to take him out to eat, buy him a drink, maybe, but don\u2019t take him out to eat because you\u2019ll be broke.\u201d", "description": "England Rugby World Cup hero Kyle Sinckler attributes his strength of character to his mum, Donna, and school rugby coach, Stacia Long", "authors": ["Julie Mccaffrey", "Image", "Getty Images", "World Rugvia Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662499.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196428424.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
