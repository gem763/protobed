Less than two hours later however, England confirmed that Spencer will replace Heinz in the 31-man squad when he arrives in Japan on Tuesday.\n\nSpencer has only three caps to his name, all as a replacement, and he has never tasted victory with England - featuring in two defeats as well as the 38-38 draw with Scotland in March \u2013 which is his most recent appearance. It is some ask for the 27-year-old to join the squad for England\u2019s biggest match for 12 years.\n\nHe was due to start for Saracens in the Premiership on Sunday but will now join the squad, who are now one win away from emulating Sir Clive Woodward\u2019s 2003 World Cup winners. It gives Spencer the opportunity to make up for the disappointment of missing out on the initial squad. He had edged ahead of Dan Robson and Danny Care in the pecking order, only for Heinz to emerge as Jones\u2019s choice as Ben Youngs\u2019 understudy.\n\nWe\u2019ve beaten the god of rugby but we still must improve, says Eddie Jones Read more\n\nAlong with Youngs, Heinz was one of just two scrum-halves in England\u2019s World Cup squad, meaning Spencer is set for a place on the bench in Saturday\u2019s final. Jones admitted he was taking a risk when naming only two scrum-halves in his 31-man squad back in August and said that George Ford could act as emergency cover if required. England moved quickly however, when doubts emerged over Heinz, who came on for Youngs against the All Blacks in the 63rd minute.", "description": "Saracens scrum-half Ben Spencer will feature in the Rugby World Cup final after being called up to replace the injured Willi Heinz", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed6befa23724d1d4b9b83c6f2cfef1d625fc8d83/0_77_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d97f2d7c82482dc69eda0241a008e975", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
