REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nThe court was ruling on a dispute between Singularis Holdings, now in liquidation, and London-based investment bank Daiwa, a subsidiary of Daiwa Securities Group Inc of Japan.\n\nThe case relates to a payment Daiwa made at the request of the main shareholder in Singularis and whether it had sufficiently carried out its duty as a financial institution to guard against fraud.\n\nIt was the first time that courts have found against a bank in respect of the so-called Quincecare duty of care for banker-customer relations, named after a court case involving Barclays bank and a company called Quincecare in 1992.\n\nIt raises the prospect of a much higher duty of care burden for financial institutions when it comes to dealing with corporate clients.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision develops the law with regard to the nature and scope of the duty owed by financial institutions to their corporate customers in situations where fraud is suspected,\u201d said Christian Tuddenham, a lawyer at Jenner & Block that assisted Singularis\u2019 liquidator, Grant Thornton.\n\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Daiwa\u2019s appeal and upheld an earlier High Court order.\n\n\u201cDenial of the claim would undermine the public interest in requiring banks to play an important part in uncovering financial crime and money laundering,\u201d the court said.\n\nDaiwa declined to comment.\n\nThe ruling could leave Britain\u2019s financial sector, already vulnerable to loss of business to the European Union because of Brexit, at risk of losing more business to other jurisdictions, said Oliver Lodge, who acted as an expert witness in the case.\n\n\u201cIt does change the recognised level of liability for banks and other financial institutions,\u201d said Lodge, also a councillor for the City of London, municipal authority for the capital\u2019s financial district.\n\nSingularis went into liquidation after Daiwa paid $200 million from Singularis\u2019 trading account to third parties on instructions from Singularis\u2019 sole shareholder Maan Al Sanea.\n\nIndebted billionaire Sanea was detained in Saudi Arabia after his company Saad defaulted together with another conglomerate in 2009, leaving banks with unpaid debts of around $22 billion.\n\nPayments made in 2009 were a misappropriation of Singularis\u2019 funds, leaving it unable to meet creditor demands, the Supreme Court said.\n\n\u201cDaiwa should have realised that something suspicious was going on and suspend payment until it had made reasonable enquiries to satisfy itself that the payments were properly made,\u201d the court said.\n\nDaiwa was \u201cwell aware\u201d of the dire straits Saad and Sanea were in at the time and Singularis has been the victim of Daiwa\u2019s negligence, it added.\n\nThe High Court had upheld a claim by Singularis for damages amounting to $150 million.\n\nGrant Thornton said the ruling will help insolvency practitioners pursue claims in future, and it expects the total amount to be about $200 million, including interest and costs.\n\nDaiwa had unsuccessfully argued that Singularis was a one-man company and would therefore have known if there was misappropriation.\n\n\u201cThe context in this case is the breach of Daiwa\u2019s Quincecare duty of care. To attribute the fraud of a trusted agent of the company to the company would denude the duty of any value in cases where it is most needed and be a retrograde step,\u201d the Supreme Court said.", "description": "Daiwa Capital Markets Europe <8601.T> lost a court appeal on Wednesday that leaves the Japanese bank facing a $150 million (\u00a3117 billion) damages bill and reinforces the expected duty of care between a bank and a corporate customer.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446494984&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0R7", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
