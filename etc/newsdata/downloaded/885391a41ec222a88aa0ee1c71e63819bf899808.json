NBA star Draymond Green admonished the \u201cdictatorship\u201d of the NCAA, and NFL star Richard Sherman argues the NCAA is a corrupt \u201cbunch of people taking advantage of kids, and doing it under the mask of fair play,\u201d reported FoxBusiness.com.\n\nEngelbert sympathizes with both sides of this issue, however, she believes \u201cthe jury is still out on whether this is the right move.\u201d\n\nModerating notions that the organization takes undue advantage of student-athletes, NCAA schools award nearly $3.5 billion in athletic scholarships annually and provide players with education off the field and further development in their sport.\n\nThe NCAA attests student-athletes graduate at higher rates than the larger student body and are provided with programs intended to help students transition to their post-collegiate lives.\n\nTo Engelbert, this issue is largely \u201cabout a fan base, especially a student fan base,\u201d emphasizing smaller Division I school's reliance on these loyal fans.\n\nIn response to California\u2019s new law, the NCAA released a statement saying the organization \u201cagrees changes are needed to continue to support student-athletes, but improvement needs to happen on a national level through the NCAA\u2019s rule-making process.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nEngelbert affirms that this is \u201ca complex issue where economics comes into it for the school, for the player, and for the fan base as well.\u201d", "description": "WNBA commissioner argued payment for college athletes is a complex issue and may have drawbacks.", "authors": ["Frank Connor"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/NCAA-logo.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
