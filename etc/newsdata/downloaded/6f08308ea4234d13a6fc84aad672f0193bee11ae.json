It includes the logo for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nIn the video, which is an edited scene from the film \"Kingsman: The Secret Service,\" Trump enters a \"Church of Fake News\" and opens fire on members of the congregation, who have various news organizations' logos or the faces of Democratic lawmakers and other critics superimposed onto their bodies.\n\nTrump proceeds to shot, stab and set fire to the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe video also shows House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is currently involved in pursuing the impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nMore: Public opinion inching closer toward Trump impeachment inquiry\n\nSeveral news outlets are depicted being killed in the rampage, including Politico, NPR, HuffPost, The Washington Post, Slate and CNN.\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association and CNN called on Trump to denounce the video.\n\n\"We have previously told the President his rhetoric would incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society,\" Jonathan Karl, the president of WHCA, said in a statement.\n\n\"The President and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone,\" a CNN statement reads.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said Sunday evening, \"Last year, a Trump supporter sent bombs to CNN\u2014and a shooter entered a church yesterday. This video isn\u2019t funny. It will get people killed.\n\nI cannot repost the \"Trump as mass murderer\" video. How low are we going to go? How much lower can we bear? \u2014 Carol Leonnig (@CarolLeonnig) October 14, 2019\n\nThe video reportedly played this weekend at a conference organized by the President\u2019s supporters at Trump National Doral is vile and dangerous. Here is my statement on behalf of @whcapic.twitter.com/fOZLMhsi7P \u2014 Jonathan Karl (@jonkarl) October 14, 2019\n\nThis is about so much more than a single video. It's about what happens when you plant seeds of hatred and division. It's about what happens when you give your supporters permission to hate and dehumanize critics. https://t.co/X77yPhn8JG \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) October 14, 2019\n\nAn organizer for the conference confirmed that the video was shown but denounced its showing as part of a \"meme exhibit\" with content submitted by third parties, according to The New York Times. \"This matter is under review,\" said the organizer Alex Phillips.\n\nPhillips also said on the conference's website it was \"shocking\" that the Times did not report on other portions of the conference, \"Including our panel conversation LITERALLY condemning political violence while claiming to be upset over a meme that was not sanctioned, shown on stage, or approved.\"\n\nFormer White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and Donald Trump Jr. were reportedly scheduled to speak at the same three-day conference where the video was played. According to The Times, representatives for the two said they did not see the video.\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign told The New York Times that the campaign was not involved in the creation of the video, and \"we do not condone violence.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly referred to members of the American press as the \"enemy of the people,\" and attacked members of the press at his campaign rallies.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/14/violent-video-trump-shooting-media-critics-shown-conference/3972884002/", "description": "News organizations have strongly condemned the violent video and called on Donald Trump and his campaign to denounce it.", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Published A.M.
