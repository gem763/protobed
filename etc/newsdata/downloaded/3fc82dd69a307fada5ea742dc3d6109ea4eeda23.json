However, given that Kerry\u2019s charitable venture was nothing more than a means of averting suspicion away from her and Amy, it\u2019s no surprise that she doesn\u2019t want media attention.\n\nTonight, matters are made much worse when Frank\u2019s keyring falls from Kerry\u2019s bag \u2014 and Tracy notices. Confused as to why her mate is in possession of such an item, she proceeds to question both Kerry and Amy about it \u2014 but Kerry\u2019s got enough to deal with, as she prepares to be interviewed by the Hotten Courier. Meanwhile, Tracy does some investigating of her own, as she searches Kerry\u2019s bedroom. She stumbles upon passports and one-way tickets \u2014 and she\u2019s incredibly confused as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTracy confronts Kerry with her discovery, and, left with no other choice, Kerry admits that she was the one responsible for Frank\u2019s death \u2014 leaving Tracy reeling.
