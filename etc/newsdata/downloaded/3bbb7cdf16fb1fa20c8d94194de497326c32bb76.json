We hope that through the procedure [age test] that we will now know his true age,' he said.\n\nFollowing the end of the relationship, Abdul reportedly stalked and threatened Mia V which saw her parents file a complaint, accusing the Afghan national of insults, threats and coercion.\n\nFar-right protesters in Chemnitz in ex-communist eastern Germany after the alleged fatal stabbing of a German man by two immigrants from Iraq and Syria\n\nThe murders of Mia V and Daniel Hillig have been seized upon by the far-right in its campaign against migrants\n\nPolice officers had notified the asylum seeker of proceedings over the harassment on the morning of the fatal stabbing.\n\nDespite the doubts over the age of many migrants entering the country, German doctors have resisted calls for medical testing, describing it as unethical.\n\nThe case is one in a string of high-profile crimes allegedly committed by asylum seekers that have stoked popular anger against the new arrivals.\n\nThis has in turn put pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel over her liberal refugee policy, which saw more than one million migrants enter the country in 2015 alone.", "description": "Abdul Mobin D, who stabbed ex Mia V to death, was found hanged in his cell at a juvenile prison in Schifferstadt, Germany, early on Thursday, though authorities said they have not found a suicide note.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/03/12/4FA960AF00000578-0-image-a-18_1535974467159.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
