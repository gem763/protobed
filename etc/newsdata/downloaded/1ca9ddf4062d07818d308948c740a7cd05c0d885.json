Then he sharply backtracked.\n\nThe arrangement didn't have anything to do with Trump's request that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky look into 2020 rival Joe Biden. Rather, Mick Mulvaney told reporters the delay in aid was tied to a Trump administration theory that Ukraine was involved in hacking the Democratic National Committee's servers in 2016.\n\nMulvaney reversed those statements later in the day, claiming the media spun his words and that the president never asked him to tie the aid money to the investigation of the server.\n\nRepublicans who support Trump have all echoed a similar refrain: There was no quid pro quo. But that message evolved from vehement denial, to embracing the help of foreign countries in rooting out corruption, to yesterday: Bargaining with aid in exchange for an investigation into domestic politics is normal.\n\n.@GOPLeader: \"There was no quid pro quo\u2026I think Mick Mulvaney clarified his statement to be very clear\u2026I take Mick Mulvaney at his word for clarification\u2026I think Mick was very clear in cleaning up his statement.\" pic.twitter.com/ySjKcL8LUN \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) October 18, 2019\n\nThe allegation that Trump pressured Zelensky to dig up dirt on the former vice president in exchange for releasing $400 million already approved by Congress stems from an anonymous whistleblower complaint that prompted House Democrats to conduct an impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nThe whistleblower said officials were concerned Trump \"is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\" In a summary put out by the White House of a July 25 call, Trump asked Zelensky to \"look into\" Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump has pushed the claim, without any credible evidence, that the former vice president pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to help his son, who at one time on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nExplainer: What really happened when Biden and the U.S. forced out Ukraine's top prosecutor\n\nDemocrats said if Trump dangled that aid in front of Zelensky in exchange for help in the 2020 election, it would be serious misconduct.\n\nTrump called it a \"perfect call\" with Zelensky. But critics have honed in on this line from the partial transcript: \"I would like you to do us a favor though,\" Trump said.\n\nThat request came after Zelensky indicated Ukraine wanted to purchase military equipment. Trump went on to ask Zelensky to look into details a hacking of the DNC prior to the 2016 election that was linked back to Russia.\n\nRead: The summary of President Trump's call with Ukraine president about Biden, as released by the White House\n\nFirst, Trump and his allies maintained for weeks that there was zero quid pro quo to be found in the call.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, after the White House's summary was released. \"The Ukrainian president admitted problems with corruption in the country and agreed that the issue at hand warranted looking into further.\"\n\n\u201cWhat a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger,\u201d tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u201cDemocrats have lost their minds when it comes to President @realDonaldTrump.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, said there was corruption, whether the pressure was explicit or implicit that Ukraine should cooperate in exchange for aid.\n\nInitial responses: GOP dismisses Trump's Ukraine call as Democrats compare it to a 'mob shakedown'\n\nBut as more details were released from closed-door testimony of Trump administration officials before Congress, the \"no quid pro quo\" defense seemed to weaken.\n\nText messages released by House Democrats show diplomats discussing the issue of quid pro quo. William Taylor, a U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, said it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance\u201d to Ukraine in exchange for \u201chelp with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nAmbassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland responded that the assertion was \u201cincorrect\u201d about Trump\u2019s intentions. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland said.", "description": "Donald Trump's acting chief of staff tried to reverse earlier comments that confirmed a quid pro quo.
