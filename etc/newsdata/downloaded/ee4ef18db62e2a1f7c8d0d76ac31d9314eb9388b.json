Photo: Johan Alp/Getty Images/Johner RF\n\nA 74-year-old woman may have just become the oldest person in the world to give birth. On Thursday, Mangayamma Yaramati of Andhra Pradesh in India welcomed twins, as in, not one but two baby girls. She also produced a birth certificate, according to the Washington Post, corroborating her claim to this advanced age: Some outlets have erroneously described her as being 73 years old, which would still make her highly remarkable, but as it stands, she is one year more remarkable than initially reported.\n\n\u201cThe mother and the babies are doing well,\u201d Yaramati\u2019s doctor, Sankkayala Uma Shankar, told the BBC. The new father, 82-year-old Sitarama Rajarao, reportedly had a stroke the next day, and is being treated at the hospital. Still, three hours after the birth, he told the BBC he and Yaramati were \u201cincredibly happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tried many times and saw many doctors, so this is the happiest time of my life,\u201d Yaramati said. In her village, she added, her neighbors singled her out for being \u201ca childless lady\u201d because she and her husband could not conceive on their own. They ended up doing IVF, fertilizing a donor egg with Rajarao\u2019s sperm, and implanting it in Yaramati\u2019s uterus. The twins were born via cesarean section.\n\nReports vary as to the babies\u2019 weights \u2014 the Post says they are 2.2 pounds each, while Newsweek says each weighed about 4.4 pounds \u2014 but regardless, pregnancies this late in life are exceedingly rare. In 2017, an Indian woman believed (but not confirmed) to be 72 years old gave birth to a healthy boy, and in 2006, a 66-year-old woman in Spain had twins.\n\nAs the Post reports, it\u2019s aging eggs \u2014 not an aging uterus \u2014 that affect fertility, and IVF helps circumvent that problem. Still, the Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine warns against this extreme degree of geriatric pregnancy (a geriatric pregnancy being, brace yourself, a pregnancy that occurs after the age of 35). The committee believes the risks are higher \u2014 both for the mother\u2019s health, and the child\u2019s future, if there\u2019s no support system in place to provide for its care further down the line.\n\nIn any case, this is almost the most unusual birthing tale we\u2019ve heard yet.
