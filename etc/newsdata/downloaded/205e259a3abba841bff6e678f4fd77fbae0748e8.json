This story of Henry V (1386-1422), still considered one of England\u2019s greatest monarchs, is a complex blend of fact and fiction.\n\nOne could argue Shakespeare led the way with his history plays, Henry IV Parts 1 & 2 and Henry V, adding colour and characters to the story for dramatic effect. Mich\u00f4d, who wrote the script in collaboration with Joel Edgerton, has taken a different set of liberties in creating a portrait of a brooding rebel-without-a-cause prince who takes up the throne with some reluctance but rapidly develops a ferocious sense of duty.\n\nThe movie was described to me as a humourless slog, and that\u2019s a fair call, although the material leaves little leeway for comedy. Its strong points are a persuasive, grimy reconstruction of the world of the early 15th century, and stunning battle scenes in which combatants in suits of armour take to each other with swords, arrows, axes and lances.\n\nThe dialogue makes a few nods towards Shakespeare, but avoids the antique cadences in favour of a more contemporary style of banter.\n\nThere is also a sustained reflection on the nature of political power and the responsibilities of a ruler, although continuity begins to drag when reflection takes over from action. The dialogue makes a few nods towards Shakespeare, but generally avoids the antique cadences in favour of a more contemporary style of banter.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who became every teenage girl\u2019s heartthrob by appearing in a movie where he had a love affair with Armie Hammer (2017's Call Me by Your Name), spends much of the movie looking as morose as a schoolboy who has been asked to clean up his room. The actual task in front of young Hal is more onerous: he will have to restore order to a kingdom riddled with civil conflicts, thanks to his cantankerous father, Henry IV (played by a debauched, long-haired Ben Mendelsohn). In the short term he has turned his back on the royal court and is slumming it in London.\n\nOn set of 'The King': a sustained reflection on the nature of political power and the responsibilities of a ruler. Netflix\n\nHis boon companion is Sir John Falstaff, a drunken, ageing knight fallen on hard times. It\u2019s worth remembering that Falstaff was Shakespeare\u2019s invention, loosely based on Sir John Oldcastle, whom the real Henry would eventually burn at the stake. There was also a knight called Sir John Fastolf, whose reputation is much disputed.\n\nThe Falstaff played by Edgerton is not just a loyal friend to the prince, but a shrewd military tactician, a philosopher and a hero. Shakespeare wouldn\u2019t recognise a figure he used as comic relief.", "description": "Australian director David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s take on Henry V is a gritty drama with plenty of carnage, but little scope for humour.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6213%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_16%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0f6e1527969216093727f52fec1779fec0eb95d9", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
