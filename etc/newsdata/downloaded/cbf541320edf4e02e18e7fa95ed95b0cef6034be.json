USA TODAY\n\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air has long been a reigning king of Hollywood.\n\nUnless you've been all about him since the early days of Big Willie Style, it might be hard to think of Will Smith, still one of the world's biggest movie stars, as a rapper and sitcom actor. But the Philadelphia native has come a long way \u2013 and ruled quite a few Fourth of July weekends at the box office \u2013 in the last 30 years.\n\nWhich is why his new movie \"Gemini Man\" (in theaters Friday) is such an interesting project for the actor. Director Ang Lee's sci-fi film stars Smith, 51, as a middle-aged assassin who's hunted by a 23-year-old clone of himself (also Smith, courtesy of some movie magic) who seems to know all the old man's moves and tricks.\n\nSmith's done everything from sci-fi invasion films and buddy action comedies to tear-jerking biopics and schmaltzy Christmas movies in his long career \u2013 sometimes with a catchy hip-hop tune he sings in the closing credits. Here's how \"Gemini Man\" ranks among his best and worst films, starting with the bad:\n\nWill Smith stars as a superhero with some serious issues in \"Hancock.\" (Photo: FRANK MASI/SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT)\n\n10. \u2018Hancock\u2019 (2008)\n\nDuring a summer of big superhero flicks (\u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d) the weakest was also the most original. Smith is a superhero who drinks and wrecks stuff in bombastic fashion and agrees to get some help from a PR guy (Jason Bateman), yet the back half of the convoluted plot fumbles a potentially interesting mythology involving ancient immortals.\n\nMartin Lawrence (left) and Will Smith are Miami cops up to old high jinks in \"Bad Boys II.\" (Photo: COLUMBIA PICTURES)\n\n9. \u2018Bad Boys II\u2019 (2003)\n\nThankfully, the third film \u201cBad Boys for Life\u201d arrives next year to try and make up for this action-packed dud that proves bigger doesn\u2019t equate to better. Smith and Martin Lawrence return as Miami cops who this time deal with Russian gangsters, Cuban drug lords, the Ku Klux Klan and bro code when it comes to dating your partner\u2019s sister, all without the charm of the original.\n\nA mysterious caddie (Will Smith, left) helps a golfer (Matt Damon) get his mojo back in \"The Legend of Bagger Vance.\" (Photo: DAVID JAMES/DREAMWORKS)\n\n8. \u2018The Legend of Bagger Vance\u2019 (2000)\n\nThe predictable and emotionally manipulative golf drama was pummeled for using the trope of a \u201cmagical\u201d black character. In this case, Smith plays the title caddie who pops up out of nowhere to advise an alcoholic World War I vet (Matt Damon) needing to get his game back in order to save the family fortune of his estranged girlfriend (Charlize Theron).\n\nThrough performance capture, 51-year-old Will Smith plays a 23-year-old version of himself in \"Gemini Man.\" (Photo: PARAMOUNT PICTURES)\n\n7. \u2018Gemini Man\u2019 (2019)\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of Smith but not much else in this far-fetched sci-fi thriller. Henry Brogan (Smith) tries to retire from his gig as a government assassin and his bosses send his 23-year-old clone Junior (also Smith, via performance capture) to kill him. It\u2019s interesting to see the moments where those two come together, but they\u2019re few and far between, considering the humdrum plot and iffy special effects.\n\nAgent J (Will Smith) and Frank the Pug team up in \"Men in Black II.\" (Photo: MELINDA SUE GORDON/COLUMBIA PICTURES)\n\n6. \u2018Men in Black II\u2019 (2002)\n\nSmith spends quite a bit of screen time with a talking pug in a suit in this forgettable sequel to the refreshing first \u201cMIB.\u201d There\u2019s a bevy of aliens, if you dig that sort of thing, but the action and gags just aren\u2019t up to snuff, the plot involving space princesses, shapeshifters and the Statue of Liberty is a mess, and a Johnny Knoxville with two heads is not better than one.\n\nWill Smith (left) starred with son Jaden Smith in M. Night Shyamalan's sci-fi film \"After Earth.\" (Photo: COLUMBIA PICTURES)\n\n5. \u2018After Earth\u2019 (2013)\n\nM. Night Shyamalan co-wrote and directed this piece of post-apocalyptic sci-fi twistiness starring Smith and his son Jaden. But, really, it\u2019s just a vanity project where they get to play father and son in futuristic space, dealing with aliens and various other dangers when they crash-land back on Earth centuries after we\u2019ve left the place.\n\n4. \u2018Winter\u2019s Tale\u2019 (2014)\n\nYou can\u2019t blame Smith for all the romantic fairy-tale cheesiness in this tale of guardian angels, miracles, spiritual destinies and love across centuries. But he does his over-the-top part as Lucifer \u2013 yep, that devilish one \u2013 a guy with a weirdly deep voice and an impressive set of chompers who orders around demonic gangster Russell Crowe.\n\nOscar (voiced by Will Smith) is one cool fish in a whirlpool of trouble in \"Shark Tale.\" (Photo: DREAMWORKS ANIMATION)\n\n3. \u2018Shark Tale\u2019 (2004)\n\nThe animated comedy offers a stellar voiceover cast (Angelina Jolie! Renee Zellweger! Martin Scorsese!) and a fishy premise for a kids\u2019 film: Parents, get ready to explain death and what it means to \u201cwack\u201d someone after watching the story of an undersea dude (Smith) who takes credit when the son of a shark mob boss (Robert De Niro) is killed and befriends the great white don\u2019s vegetarian kid (Jack Black).\n\nHoward (Will Smith) writes cathartic letters to Love, Time and Death to come to grips with the loss of his daughter in \"Collateral Beauty.\" (Photo: BARRY WETCHER/WARNER BROS.)\n\n2. \u2018Collateral Beauty\u2019 (2016)\n\nIn the wannabe holiday classic that aims for Christmas mushiness and instead leans unseasonably cynical, Smith plays a grieving father and ad executive who cathartically writes letters to Love, Time and Death. He\u2019s reasonably watchable but not much else is in a terrible tweak on the \u201cChristmas Carol\u201d template.\n\nArtemus Gordon (Kevin Kline, left) and James West (Will Smith) are forced to wear magnetic collars in the Western comedy adventure \"Wild Wild West.\" (Photo: MURRAY CLOSE/WARNER BROS.)\n\n1. \u2018Wild Wild West\u2019 (1999)\n\nThis horrendous gunslinging misfire arrived at the height of Smith\u2019s Hollywood reign. The action-comedy adaptation of the 1960s TV Western wastes Smith and Kevin Kline as a couple of Secret Service lawmen protecting Ulysses Grant from some crazy Confederates, and not even evil Kenneth Branagh in a mechanical spider can save the day.\n\nNow on to the hotness:\n\nWill Smith (with Eva Mendes) stars as a \"date doctor\" who's kind of a mess when it comes to his own relationships in \"Hitch.\" (Photo: BARRY WETCHER/SONY PICTURES)\n\n10. 'Hitch' (2005)\n\nIf only we all had Smith in our lives as a romance coach. His \"date doctor\" Hitch helps a schlubby dude (Kevin James) woo a celebrity client (Amber Valletta), though it turns out the expert needs some help with his own relationships. A comedy that would be a major disaster except for Smith just owning every bit of it (and slapping James around, to boot).\n\nDeadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) have to save the world in \"Suicide Squad.\" (Photo: CLAY ENOS)\n\n9. \u2018Suicide Squad\u2019 (2016)\n\nIn this colorful crew of supervillains, Smith\u2019s highly weaponized hitman Deadshot is one of the more grounded personalities. A devoted father as well as a highly skilled killer, Deadshot is a self-aware guy rotting in a prison for the worst of the worst when he's called into duty with some fellow misfits because a supernatural witch is holding a city hostage.\n\nWill Smith is a lawyer who's on the run from the government in \"Enemy of the State.\" (Photo: TOUCHSTONE)\n\n8. \u2018Enemy of the State\u2019 (1998)\n\nMaybe the most relevant movie now among Jerry Bruckheimer\u2019s enjoyably bombastic '90s action flicks, \u201cEnemy\u201d centers on surveillance states and government cover-ups in the story of a labor lawyer (Smith) who has his entire life torn asunder when videotape of a murdered journalist winds up in his possession. Help comes from an ex-intelligence operative (Gene Hackman) just as crafty as the bad guys.\n\n7. \u2018Six Degrees of Separation\u2019 (1993)\n\nSmith was just a TV star making his Hollywood debut in the dramedy about a young grifter who cons his way into the household of a wealthy New York couple (Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland) by saying he was just robbed and pretending he\u2019s Sidney Poitier\u2019s son. The film follows his various chicanery and in the process showcases the beginnings of Smith\u2019s undeniable charm as a leading man.\n\nWill Smith plays Muhammad Ali in the biopic \"Ali.\" (Photo: FRANK CONNOR/COLUMBIA PICTURES)\n\n6. \u2018Ali\u2019 (2001)\n\nSmith earned his first Oscar nomination for floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee in the Muhammad Ali biopic, which follows the iconic boxer\u2019s life from losing the title to Sonny Liston to getting it back vs. George Foreman. The performance is slightly better than the movie: Smith nails both the emotional and physical aspects of Ali\u2019s life inside the ring and outside dealing with racial issues.\n\nWill Smith is the last man alive in New York after a deadly virus wipes everyone out in \"I Am Legend.\" (Photo: BARRY WETCHER/WARNER BROS.)\n\n5. \u2018I Am Legend\u2019 (2007)\n\nThe big-budget adaptation of Richard Matheson\u2019s classic post-apocalyptic novel brought together Smith\u2019s thespian and blockbuster sides (as well as his dog-loving one!) playing a scientist who\u2019s the last man standing in New York City after a deadly virus wipes everyone out. Sure, there are vampire-y creatures for him to fight, but Smith brings needed gravitas and solemnity along with the brawn.\n\nWill Smith (left) and Tommy Lee Jones keep Earth safe from alien threats in \"Men in Black.\" (Photo: MELINDA SUE GORDON/COLUMBIA/TRISTAR)\n\n4. \u2018Men in Black\u2019 (1997)\n\nBuddy comedies are often best with extremes, and that\u2019s what you get when you stick Smith\u2019s cocky young rookie learning the ins and outs of alien wonders with Tommy Lee Jones\u2019 grumpy old veteran. Everything works, from the super-fun details of the secretive MIB organization to Vincent D\u2019Onofrio as an extraterrestrial bug in an ill-fitting human suit.\n\nMartin Lawrence (left) and Will Smith keep Tea Leoni safe from a drug kingpin in \"Bad Boys.\" (Photo: JON FARMER/COLUMBIA PICTURES)\n\n3. \u2018Bad Boys\u2019 (1995)\n\nTeam-ups have been a running theme in Smith\u2019s career, though arguably the best one is with Martin Lawrence in this excellent action comedy from Michael Bay\u2019s pre-\u201cTransformers\u201d days. You can\u2019t beat the yin of Smith\u2019s ladies\u2019 man Mike Lowrey playing off the yang of Lawrence\u2019s family dude Marcus Burnett, who switch personalities to save Tea Leoni from a French drug kingpin and his hit squad.\n\nWill Smith (right) stars alongside his son Jaden in the emotional drama \"The Pursuit of Happyness.\" (Photo: ZADE ROSENTHAL/SONY PICTURES)\n\n2. \u2018The Pursuit of Happyness\u2019 (2006)\n\nInstead of \u201cAfter Earth,\u201d check out a film with Smith and his son Jaden that's actually good: The uplifting biopic centers on Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman and dad trying to create a life and home for him and his young son, as he fights his way up the company ladder as a stockbroker. The elder Smith snagged his second Oscar nod for a performance that\u2019ll give you quite a few feels.\n\nWill Smith (left) and Jeff Goldblum were a dynamic duo against invading aliens in \"Independence Day.\" (Photo: CLAUDETTE BARIUS, 20TH CENTURY FOX)\n\n1. \u2018Independence Day\u2019 (1996)\n\nRoland Emmerich\u2019s sci-fi disaster film scores so many points: alien invaders destroying the White House in epic fashion, Jeff Goldblum going full Goldblum, etc. It\u2019s Smith, though, who makes it truly fabulous as a heroic fighter pilot with tons of bravado (and a hint of vulnerability) who wants to make it back to his family \u2013 and punch a few extraterrestrials in the face along the way.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/09/ranked-will-smith-best-and-worst-movies/3903097002/", "description": "Will Smith has been a Hollywood A-lister for three decades, and in honor of his new 'Gemini Man,' we're ranking his very best and very worst films.", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published A.M.
