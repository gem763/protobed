Despite that, he still showed up to help build a home with Habitat for Humanity the next day in Nashville, Tennessee. He used a cane when he rallied volunteers that morning.\n\nAP", "description": "Former US President Jimmy Carter has been hospitalized after a fall at his home in Plains, Georgia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/22/5daeea6da310cf3e97a279dd.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
