Doctors were able to perform the c-section via which Gavin was born weighing four pounds.\n\nSteve has written a book about their story, most of which Camre doesn\u2019t remember (Pictures: Steve Curto)\n\nBut as well as the seizure, Camre had a cataclysmic stroke which affected both sides of her brain. As a result, her long and short-term memory was wiped out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCamre has began reading her husband\u2019s book and is enjoying it despite not remembering most of it.\n\nShe has also moved back in with him and established a routine that helps her remember snapshots of her former life.\n\nBaby Gavin had the toughest start to his life, having spent 36 days in intensive care after being born prematurely.\n\nHe was away for his mum too as Camre spent 30 days in hospital.\n\nDoctors later figured out that Camre had undiagnosed preeclampsia \u2013 a high blood pressure condition that reduces blood flow to the foetus.\n\nIt was then Camre was put into a medically-induced coma. Everything was different when she eventually woke up.\n\nCamre had moved back in with her parents during the first few months of her recovery (Pictures: Steve Curto)\n\nSteve likened the experience to having two newborns.\n\nHe told Good Morning America: \u2018When they brought her out of the coma, and she started to wake up, something wasn\u2019t right.\n\n\u2018She had no idea who she was or that she had just given birth. She didn\u2019t know who I was or who her parents were.\n\n\u2018I basically lived at the hospital. They want the child to bond with the mum after birth but Camre wasn\u2019t able to bet there, so I did skin-to-skin with him and did all the feedings.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCamre spent the first few months of her recovery away from her husband and child. But in that time she had plenty of contact with both.\n\nSteve remembers one night in particular that meant a lot: \u2018We were sitting on the couch and she told me, I don\u2019t who you are but I know I love you.\n\n\u2018That has always stuck with me. That has been the driving force behind everything.\u2019\n\nNow she\u2019s moved back in with her husband and child and is making new memories (Pictures: Steve Curto)\n\nNow Camre is making new memories with Steve and Gavin who is a toddler. She writes things down, role-plays conversations and shares her phone calendar with Steve to aid memories.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to focus on what matters: \u2018With my husband and son with me, that is what is getting me through all this.\n\n\u2018Every time I see Gavin and Steve, there\u2019s a huge smile on my face and inside me. The love of family is what means the most and what is getting me through every day.\u2019\n\nMORE: Incredible photo shows how bones move during childbirth\n\nMORE: Mums say this comb hack helped with childbirth pains\n\nMORE: Weed \u2018could stop the memory loss caused by old age,\u2019 study finds\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Steve Curto wrote a book dedicated to his wife entitled But I Know I Love You after she lost her memory during childbirth.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93272600_1572277790.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
