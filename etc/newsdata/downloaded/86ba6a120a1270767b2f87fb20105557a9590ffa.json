The kittens would not survive long on their own, they realised, and so an urgent search for them was launched.\n\nEventually two of the three were found and reunited with their mother. Her leg was treated by vets from White Oak Conservation Foundation and the trio were eventually reintroduced into the wild.\n\nIt was the first time a Florida panther family had been rescued, rehabilitated and released back into the wild together, and an image of the two young males \u2013 anaesthetised prior to a final pre-release check-up \u2013 was taken by wildlife photographer Carlton Ward. His picture is one of a series he has taken of Florida panthers, images that will receive a highly commended award at the Wildlife Photographer of the Year ceremony at the Natural History Museum in London this week.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vets carry two of the anaesthetised \u201ckittens\u201d into the clinic for a check-up before they are released.

However, by the middle of the last century hunting and habitat loss had reduced their population \u2013 now isolated to a pocket of southern Florida \u2013 to about 30 to 40 adults. The animals were heading for extinction but were saved when they became one of the first to gain federal protection under the Endangered Species Preservation Act. Hunting of the panther was outlawed and some land set aside for reserves, such as the Big Cypress national preserve, near Naples.\n\nAs a result, Florida panther numbers have slowly risen over the past 50 years, with the adult population now standing at more than 200.\n\nBut new threats to the Florida panther \u2013 a subspecies of puma, or mountain lion \u2013 are emerging. Florida is losing more than 100,000 acres of rural and natural land each year to provide homes for the massive influx of people moving into the state. It is estimated that a third of a million people are settling in Florida every year.\n\nIn addition, new roads are being built across the panther\u2019s last reserves and there have been worrying numbers of deaths. About 30 panthers a year are killed on the state\u2019s roads, according to Ward. In addition, ranch lands used by panthers to move around are now being sold to housing estate developers, which threatens to cut off essential wildlife corridors.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cowboys herd cattle at Buck Island Ranch near Lake Placid in central Florida.

The need for action is urgent, he added.\n\nRecent photographs \u2013 taken by Ward using remotely triggered cameras \u2013 indicate that the Florida panther is beginning to extend its range slowly northward and has recently crossed the Caloosahatchee river, which cuts across much of south Florida. Crucially, these images were of female panthers. In the past, males \u2013 which patrol ranges of up to 200 square miles \u2013 have been spotted in northern Florida but until now they had no chance of finding a mate. Ward\u2019s photographs of a female and two offspring moving northwards offer new hope that the panther\u2019s range can be extended. \u201cHowever, we have to find ways to protect these new reserves and to build up numbers of Florida panthers to ensure their future survival,\u201d said Ward.\n\nWildlife Photographer of the Year, Natural History Museum London, 18 October 2019 \u2013 31 May 2020", "description": "Carlton Ward\u2019s photographs chart survival struggle of one of America\u2019s last remaining big cats", "authors": ["Robin Mckie"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27627090305bc34d7786d77ee128e51a62b9e2f5/0_395_5923_3554/master/5923.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=16eedc249eed0e0646e1b35aabeaf939", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
