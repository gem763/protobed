Mandatory Credit: Mike DiNovo-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNagy confirmed Monday that Trubisky, not backup Chase Daniel, will start Sunday when the Bears bring a three-game losing streak into Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cWe understand that we didn\u2019t get the win, but we felt there was definitely an improvement,\u201d Nagy said of Trubisky\u2019s performance Sunday during a 17-16 setback.\n\nTrubisky, 25, completed 23 of 35 passes for 253 yards with zero touchdowns, one interception and one fumble against the Chargers. He did lead the team into field-goal range late in the game, only to see Eddy Pineiro miss a 41-yard field-goal attempt as time expired.\n\n\u2014Denver Broncos quarterback Brandon Allen will make his NFL debut this weekend when he gets the start against the visiting Cleveland Browns, the team announced.\n\nAllen was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft.

He has been out ever since, and Rivera said the former MVP is steadily working his way back.\n\nAllen has started the past five games for the Panthers, who saw their four-game winning streak end Sunday with a 51-13 road loss to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\u2014Defensive lineman Leonard Williams will trade uniforms but not home cities, going from the New York Jets to the Giants via trade on Monday, according to multiple media reports.\n\nThe 2015 first-round pick goes to the Giants in exchange for a 2020 third-round draft pick and a conditional fifth-rounder in 2021.

Williams, 25, is set to become a free agent at the end of the 2019 season.\n\n\u2014The Philadelphia Eagles acquired defensive end Genard Avery from the Browns for an undisclosed 2021 draft pick.\n\nAvery, who was selected by Cleveland win the fifth round of the 2018 NFL Draft out of Memphis, recorded 4.5 sacks while playing in all 16 games during his rookie season. The 24-year-old has seen his playing time diminish this season.

Mosley could be done for the year with a groin injury.\n\nDarnold was injured Sunday in a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, head coach Adam Gase announced. Gase said the injury will be a concern the rest of the season, but Darnold will play through the discomfort.\n\n\u2014Miami Dolphins running back Kenyan Drake was traded to the Arizona Cardinals in exchange for a conditional draft pick.

The former fourth overall pick has two years left on a five-year, $66 million deal.\n\n\u2014Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt will have surgery this week to repair the torn pectoral muscle that ended his season Sunday, NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport reported.\n\nWatt, 30, faces a recovery time of approximately four months and should be ready in time for OTAs and minicamp this spring, per the report.\n\n\u2014Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeSean Jackson and running back Darren Sproles are expected to return to practice this week, coach Doug Pederson announced.\n\nJackson has been sidelined since Week 2 with an abdominal injury while Sproles has been plagued by an ailing quadriceps since the Eagles\u2019 31-6 victory over the Jets on Oct. 6.\n\n\u2014Less than two weeks after he was released, Cody Kessler was brought back by the New England Patriots to give the team two backup quarterbacks behind Tom Brady.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy is not making a quarterback change following Mitchell Trubisky's two costly fourth-quarter turnovers on Sunday in a loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446045625&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S03W-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
