Cook in boiling water for approximately 2 mins until just tender. Drain and cool immediately in cold water to stop the cooking process and lock in the colour.\n\nGive the saucepan a wipe clean and return to the heat with 1tbsp cooking oil. Get the oil very hot, add the radishes with a good pinch of salt and fry vigorously for 1 min before adding half the butter, half the vinegar (1tbsp) and 3tbsp water. Cook on a high heat stirring often for 4-5 mins until the liquid has reduced down into a glossy, buttery glaze. The radishes should be partly cooked but still have a slight bite to them. Remove from the heat and keep to one side.\n\nToast the walnuts in a dry frying pan on a medium heat for a few mins, until lightly coloured \u2013 careful not to burn them. Tip onto a board and coarsely chop.\n\nMake the dressing by mixing the mustard and remaining vinegar together. Whisk in 2-3tbsp olive oil, a little bit at a time, until you have an emulsified dressing. Stir in the walnuts and season with salt and pepper.\n\nReturn the frying pan to the heat with 1tbsp oil. Season the steaks with salt and pepper on both sides. Get the oil very hot, fry steaks for 1 min a side. Add the remaining butter halfway through cooking \u2013 they should be nicely browned. Remove the steaks and let them rest for 4-5 mins while you finish the salad.\n\nAdd the cooled beans to the pan of warm radishes and mix in finely chopped chervil leaves.\n\nDivide the salad leaves between two plates, put on the beans and radishes then crumble blue cheese on top.\n\nSlice the steaks into \u00bdcm strips. Scatter the steak across the salad and spoon across the walnut dressing.\n\nRecipe from Riverford.co.uk", "description": "Steak and\u00a0blue cheese salad with green beans, tomatoes and\u00a0walnut dressing Prep and\u00a0cook: 35 mins Serves 2 Lightly cooked radishes retain a satisfying crunch while soaking up richness and\u00a0piquancy from the butter and\u00a0vinegar in this recipe.
