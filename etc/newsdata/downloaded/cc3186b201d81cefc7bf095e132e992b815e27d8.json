Actions count, not words. Members of the Iranian government talk, but have no power. Those who have, like the Revolutionary Guards, don\u2019t want to negotiate,\u201d Jubeir told Liberation newspaper in an interview.\n\nHe was responding to a question about French attempts to bring the United States and Iran together, including by convincing U.S. President Donald Trump to lift sanctions on Iran.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron attempted and failed last month to broker talks between Trump and Rouhani in New York. Prospects of any talks in coming weeks seem slim, with Tehran demanding U.S. sanctions are lifted first.\n\n\u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, maximum pressure is the only way,\u201d Jubeir said.\n\nWhen asked about the status of talks between Yemen\u2019s Saudi-backed government and southern separatists, Jubeir said it was crucial to end their differences to ensure focus could turn to battling the Iran-aligned Houthi group and al-Qaeda militants.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to reach peace between the (separatist) Southern Transition Council (STC) and the Hadi government. I think we are close,\u201d he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has hosted indirect talks between them to rebuild the coalition fighting against the Houthi movement that expelled Hadi\u2019s government from the capital Sanaa five years ago.
