He was rookie of the year during the 2005-06 season, the first of two years he spent in Oklahoma City.\n\nNow he\u2019s 34, a nine-time All-Star who came back to where it all started by way of a trade that sent Thunder cornerstone Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets in exchange.\n\nPaul still has fond memories of the community that welcomed him to the NBA.\n\n\u201cThe people here, the fans here, make this city what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Our life comes full circle. Now I have two kids. To bring them out here - they came out here this weekend to see me, them and my wife - it\u2019s cool to give them perspective because it changes.\u201d\n\nPaul, who averaged 15.6 points and 8.2 assists last season, said he holds no resentment toward the Rockets for trading him. He still feels he has plenty left to offer, and he looks forward to working with coach Billy Donovan and being a major piece of the rebuilt Thunder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because a lot of people try to tell your truth, try to tell your story, say what you want and a lot of different kind of stuff. I\u2019m excited about the opportunity, excited about our team and excited about Billy.\u201d\n\nHere are some things to watch as the Thunder head into training camp Tuesday:\n\nNEW FACES\n\nCenter Steven Adams had played his entire NBA career in Oklahoma City with Westbrook. He said it\u2019s a bit strange not having him around.\n\n\u201cIn terms of personal relationships, like it just affects that a little bit, you know,\u201d Adams said. \u201cStill going to be there, but you\u2019re thinking argh, I don\u2019t get to see them as often, you know. So obviously it\u2019s a bit tough, mate, but you know, you deal with it. Still above ground.\u201d\n\nBACKCOURT DEPTH\n\nPaul has a chance to mentor guards Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander averaged 10.8 points and 3.3 assists as a rookie last season. He joined the Thunder in the deal that sent All-Star forward Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers. Schroder is the top returning scorer after averaging 15.5 points last season.\n\nDonovan said all three could play together at times.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what it comes down to,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cMultiple ball handlers down on the floor. You want to be able to incorporate all those guys so that they\u2019re flowing and playing together.\u201d\n\nNO TANKING\n\nGilgeous-Alexander knows media expectations are low this season after the Thunder traded Westbrook and George. He\u2019s not focused on that.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I try not to worry about everything that the league or the media says in terms of things like tanking and things like that, expectations for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if we\u2019re focus on ourselves, try to get better every day, and play to the best of our ability the best we can, it\u2019ll take us where it takes us. Whether it be the playoffs, not the playoffs, finals run, never know.\u201d\n\nADAMS\u2019 ROLE\n\nAdams\u2019 numbers could jump this season. The 7-foot center averaged 13.9 points and 9.5 rebounds last season while shooting nearly 60% from the field. He heard his name in trade talks this summer, but he\u2019s focused on what he can do this season.\n\n\u201cIt still affects you in some way. You know, because you\u2019re human, and you care,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you care about something - obviously I care about the organization here. But again, we\u2019re here because we\u2019re trying to support the organization itself, and the organization needs to do well, right? So you have to keep that in mind. You\u2019re just here to help.\u201d\n\nROBERSON\u2019S RETURN\n\nForward Andre Roberson, one of the league\u2019s best perimeter defensive players, is expected to play in the preseason after missing the past 1 \u00bd seasons with a left knee injury. He said he learned a lot during his time away.\n\n\u201cA lot of ups and downs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about myself, about my body, just about the game in general and just kind of the effect on my life. It\u2019s just been a great character builder and great to see the game from a different perspective.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chris Paul is happy to be back where his professional career began.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cliff Brunt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/thunder_media_day_basketball_91623_c0-976-2128-2216_s1770x1032.jpg?a616d1838c97d9eaed26612ebff250f2db8c83f3", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
