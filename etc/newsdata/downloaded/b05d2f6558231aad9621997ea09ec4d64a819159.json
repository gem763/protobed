By the time the United States entered World War I, he was leading a Pittsburgh-based, multimillion-dollar international company.\n\nThe empire Henry John Heinz built marks its 150th anniversary this year, with events and special commemorations in Pittsburgh and around the world.\n\nThe son of German Lutheran immigrants \u201cwas wheeling things around in a wheelbarrow\u201d and found that people loved what he was selling, said Andrew Masich, executive director of the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District.\n\nHeinz attended Duff\u2019s Mercantile College in Pittsburgh and was a bookkeeper at his father\u2019s Sharpsburg brickyard. But he continued growing produce and making his own products, namely horseradish.\n\nIn 1869, he parlayed that early success selling food into founding Heinz, Noble & Co., or simply Heinz & Noble, first using the brand name Anchor Pickle and Vinegar Works. He was 25.\n\nFour years later, the company had lines of sauerkraut, pickles, vinegar and horseradish. But it also fell victim to the Panic of 1873.\n\nHeinz filed for bankruptcy and spent time in jail \u201cbecause that\u2019s the way they handled debtors in those days,\u201d Masich said.\n\nThe experience cured Heinz of forming future partnerships, such as the one that soured with brothers Clarence and E.J. Noble.\n\nBy 1876, Heinz was back in the business - working with his cousin and brother, who had formed the F & J Heinz Co.\n\nThat same year, the company introduced Heinz Tomato Ketchup - similar to a fish sauce product the Chinese had made for 1,000 years. Heinz found a way to make it better, Masich said.\n\n\u201cThat was his philosophy - to do a common thing, uncommonly well,\u201d he said.\n\nHeinz introduced concepts like refrigerated railcars, steam pressure cooking and vacuum-packed canning to preserve food longer. He also set his sights on expanding sales internationally.\n\nIn 1886, he traveled to England and cold-called at London\u2019s famed Fortnum & Mason, which supplied groceries to the royal family and other well-heeled customers.\n\n\u201cI think, Mr. Heinz, we\u2019ll take the lot!\u201d the store\u2019s grocery buyer told Heinz, purchasing all five cases he had of ketchup, baked beans, cream of tomato soup and other products, according to company history.\n\nFor its 150th anniversary, Heinz has partnered with Fortnum & Mason for a specially packaged, limited edition line of those same products.\n\nIn 1888, Heinz took sole ownership of the company, which he renamed H.J. Heinz.\n\n\u201cHe never had a partner again,\u201d Masich said. \u201cHe restored his reputation. He built this food empire that was on every continent, except Antarctica.\u201d\n\nBy the time Heinz died in 1919, his company had more than 6,500 employees and 25 factories along with over 150 places around the country to collect cucumbers and tomatoes from farmers along with 85 salting stations to make pickles, according to company history.\n\nIn 2015, H.J. Heinz Co. and Kraft Foods Group Inc. merged to combine some of the most iconic food brands in America - and the world - under Kraft Heinz, a new publicly traded company. Heinz entered the deal with reported sales of $10.9 billion the previous year, the Tribune-Review reported at the time.\n\nCelebrating history\n\nThe 150th anniversary of the founding of the classic Pittsburgh company is being celebrated at the Heinz History Center, which is home to the largest collection of Heinz artifacts and archival material in the world. This month at the museum is dubbed \u201cHeinztoberfest,\u201d which started last week with a 21+ Night and will continue Oct. 19 with a specially themed Hometown-Homegrown food festival, now in its eighth year.\n\nAs for Kraft Heinz, with headquarters in Pittsburgh and Chicago, the company gave away 75,000 gold pickle pins at the local Picklesburgh festival in July. Through Oct. 19, Heinz is involved in a special social media promotion for the 150th anniversary with another Pittsburgh food icon: Primanti Bros. restaurants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been serving Heinz ketchup since the beginning - in 1933,\u201d Toni Haggerty, a Primanti\u2019s sandwich shop employee for more than 40 years, said in a statement announcing the promotion. \u201cFrom the original location all the way to our newest openings. It\u2019s only Heinz. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019ll be for the next 150 years, too.\u201d\n\nThe biggest project the company endeavored for its anniversary was partnering with British pop singer Ed Sheeran - a Heinz ketchup super-fan - for a television commercial and the launch of limited-edition bottles of \u201cEdchup,\u201d featuring a replica of a Heinz tattoo Sheeran has on his arm, said Michael Mullen, a Kraft Heinz spokesman.\n\nLasting legacy\n\nHonoring the century and a half of Henry John Heinz and the legacy he built at the history center that bears his family is appropriate, Masich said.\n\n\u201cHe built the first worldwide food empire. It started here (Pittsburgh),\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ketchup in our veins.\u201d\n\nHeinz was a contemporary of other local giants of business and commerce, both in Pittsburgh and worldwide - Andrew Carnegie in steel; George Westinghouse in electricity and railroad equipment; Henry Clay Frick in coal, coke and steel; and Thomas Mellon in finance.\n\nBut Heinz was a business genius in his own right, Masich said as he stood amid the 2,700-square-foot Heinz exhibit at the history center. He not only sold the products people wanted, but he knew how to package and market them to customers. None other than automobile magnate Henry Ford recognized Heinz as one of America\u2019s innovators.\n\n\u201cThe thing that H.J. Heinz really pioneered was branding and marketing. He was an intuitive marketer,\u201d Masich said.\n\nTo publicize his pickle business, Heinz created a green pickle pin emblazoned with his name. The first pins were distributed as a marketing ploy to get people to visit the Heinz booth at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\n\n\u201cHe gave over a million of those pickle pins in one year,\u201d Masich said of the 1893 World\u2019s Fair.\n\n\u201cHeinz just invented so much of what we know as food marketing,\u201d said Gabriella Petrick, a historian of food and food systems and a visiting scholar in the history department at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. She has written extensively on the industrialization of food and is regarded as an expert on the H.J. Heinz Co.\n\nHe invented free samples and hired young saleswomen - the \u201cpickle girls\u201d - to give food demonstrations to other women.\n\n\u201cIt would be a huge event when they came into town,\u201d said Petrick, a Greater Latrobe High School graduate.\n\nHeinz was particular in the way his food was produced to convince customers who could make their own food that they could rely upon an industrial product that was safe to eat, Petrick said.\n\nWhen it came to selling ketchup, Heinz put it in a distinctive package and patented the shape - an octagonal bottle with a cigar label around the neck to hide any unsightly watery or oxidized ketchup. He put it on a keystone design because Pennsylvania is the Keystone State.\n\n\u201cHe used clear glass bottles instead of the brown glass or green glass,\u201d Masich said. \u201cHe wanted people to see his product. He wanted them to see the purity of it.\u201d\n\nHeinz was spurred on to produce food of high quality, in part, by his strong religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cHe felt he had a moral obligation\u201d to produce quality food, Petrick said.\n\nTo ensure that produced food was safe, Heinz in the early 1900s spurred on the passage of the federal Food and Drug Act, which Petrick said was patterned after stricter regulations already in place in Pennsylvania.\n\nHeinz developed the slogan - 57 varieties - at a time when his company had more than 57 products, Masich said.\n\n\u201cHe liked the look of that number. He said, \u2018I can put that on hillsides and billboards, bottles and signs.\u2019 He branded his company with that 57 variety slogan and the number stuck,\u201d he said.\n\nTo spread his products around the world, Heinz had an army of salesman who traveled with samples because he knew if people would buy his food if they tried it, Masich said.\n\nIn the 1890s, he built a factory complex of 17 building along the north shore of the Allegheny River in Troy Hill, across from Downtown Pittsburgh. Unlike Carnegie and Frick, whose businesses were beset violent labor disputes, Heinz took a far different approach to employee relations.\n\n\u201cHe kind of revolutionized the way factory owners and company owners did business, relative to their employees,\u201d Masich said. \u201cHe was benevolent industrialist.\u201d\n\nMuch of his large female workforce that bottled pickles lived in houses without indoor water or plumbing. Heinz provided them with daily manicures to make certain their hands were clean when they handled the food, Masich said.\n\n\u201cHe built a family business, but on a huge scale,\u201d Masich said. \u201cThese kids would get together and go on baseball outings, boating trips and carriage rides. They would have picnics in the park. They were very proud of their association with the H.J. Heinz Company.\n\n\u201cThey were part of the family, and it was a lifetime commitment. It was career. You stuck with the H.J. Heinz Company.\u201d\n\nSources of historical information contained in this article include: Heinz, Senator John Heinz History Center, VisitPA.com, JohnHeinzLegacy.org and HistoricPittsburgh.org.\n\nSidebar:\n\nRed letter dates in H.J.
