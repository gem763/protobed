CNG\u2019s vehicle fuel division, NGV Gas, gets its gas from Egoli Gas.\n\nFor CNG\u2019s clients it\u2019s not just about cleaner energy, but about competitive prices compared with diesel, paraffin and, over the long term, coal.\n\nCompressed natural gas can halve the fuel bill of vehicles that do a lot of kilometres a month, said Williams.\n\nApart from taxis, about 150 fleet vehicles \u2013 such as trucks and delivery vehicles \u2013 in the province have been modified to use natural gas as fuel.\n\nGauteng has more than 830 000 light delivery vehicles for which gas can be a cost-effective option, said Williams.\n\nCNG is in talks with vehicle manufacturers about importing vehicles that use gas, which are already being sold in other parts of the world.\n\nThe natural gas is compressed at CNG\u2019s facility in Langlaagte and delivered to customers in special cylinders by road.\n\nIf the gas runs out, the vehicle can still be driven using petrol or diesel.\n\nThe modification required for a vehicle to run off these cylinders costs about R26 000.\n\nNo mechanical modifications to the vehicle are made and it still retains its conventional fuel tank because a small amount of petrol or diesel is still used when the engine is turned on.\n\nIf the gas runs out, the vehicle can still be driven using petrol or diesel.\n\nCompressed gas costs about R9.99 a litre, compared with R16 a litre for 95-octane petrol and more than R14 for diesel.\n\nCNG estimates a vehicle that travels 5 000km a month \u2013 such as taxis and delivery vehicles \u2013 can recoup the modification\u2019s cost in about seven months.\n\nCNG has its own gas fuel station in Langlaagte, Johannesburg, as well as gas pumps at four other filling stations in Johannesburg and Pretoria.\n\nIn the near future, it plans to add another four pumps at filling stations.\n\nWilliams said natural gas is a very safe fuel. It does not have to be stored underground, has a very high ignition point and isn\u2019t toxic.\n\nREAD: We want to be the Tesla of Africa \u2013 company planning to manufacture electric taxis in SA\n\nBecause it is lighter than air, it dissipates quickly in the event of a leak, rather than forming a puddle on the ground.\n\nGas is becoming increasingly attractive to other energy consumers.\n\nTen state hospitals in Gauteng have converted their boilers from coal energy to natural gas to save money and cut back on pollution.\n\nWilliams said that although coal costs only about 33% as much as natural gas, which costs about half as much as liquid petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas is still cheaper in the long term if the maintenance that is required is taken into account.\n\nIn the eight years that NGV has been supplying compressed natural gas, there has not been a price increase, said Williams.\n\nThis is because the price of natural gas is stable and does not fluctuate in the way LPG, which is linked to the cost of brent crude oil, does.", "description": "About 1 200 minibus taxis in Johannesburg are using natural gas as fuel and the suppliers of this gas believe that increasing numbers of commercial vehicles will run on gas in the future, instead of on petrol or diesel.", "authors": ["Riana De Lange"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5198/149ec2a0c43b413d86322e076e28eba6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
