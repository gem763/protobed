Her novels are phenomenally popular at home and abroad, and in her columns for the Guardian newspaper she speaks to a Western audience with more authority than any Turkish minister could possibly command.\n\nShe should be a source of national pride \u2014 and she is for the readers of Turkey \u2014 but her courageous advocacy for the rights of women, children and LGBTQ people raises the ire of anti-intellectual nationalists. In 2006, her second novel, \u201cThe Bastard of Istanbul,\u201d was longlisted for Britain\u2019s Orange Prize, but it also got her accused of \u201cinsulting Turkishness.\u201d That case was eventually dismissed, but earlier this year, Turkish prosecutors launched an investigation of her novels going back 20 years. Among her alleged crimes: obscene depictions of sexual abuse.\n\nFor Shafak, now living in London, that\u2019s a bitter irony. \u201cThis is a country in which we have an escalating number of cases of sexual violence against both women and children,\u201d she told a reporter in May. \u201cTurkish courts are not taking action, the laws have not been changed. So in a country where they need to take urgent action to deal with sexual violence, instead they\u2019re prosecuting writers.\u201d\n\nRather than cowering, Shafak is striking back in the most effective way she can. Her new novel, \u201c10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World,\u201d is a deeply humane story about the cruel effects of Turkey\u2019s intolerant sexual attitudes. Better yet, it\u2019s shortlisted for the Booker Prize, which, one hopes, will bring even more pressure on the Turkish government to stop harassing this immensely talented artist.\n\nThe opening of \u201c10 Minutes\u201d is grim. It\u2019s 1990, and our heroine, Leila, is a prostitute stuffed in a dumpster on the outskirts of Istanbul: \u201cShe now realized with a sinking feeling that her heart had just stopped beating,\u201d Shafak writes, \u201cand her breathing had abruptly ceased, and whichever way she looked at her situation there was no denying that she was dead.\u201d\n\nThat weirdly macabre introduction reminds me of Richard Flanagan\u2019s first novel, \u201cDeath of a River Guide,\u201d published 25 years ago. His story transpires in the time it takes a man trapped underwater to drown. Shafak has done Flanagan one better. Much of her story takes place during the 10 minutes and 38 seconds after Leila\u2019s death, during that mysterious period when, as Emily Dickinson put it, \u201cYour breath has time to straighten, / Your brain to bubble cool.\u201d In those liminal moments, alternately lucid and surreal, Leila recalls her life, from her birth all the way to the tragic step that left her body in a dumpster.\n\nShafak is sympathetic to Leila\u2019s point of view, but not constrained by it. She describes the unhappy, polygamous home where Leila\u2019s future mother is expected to be docile and fertile. In 1947, Van \u2014 1,000 miles from Istanbul \u2014 is a city still infused with ancient superstitions and prejudices. These people\u2019s ignorance of the human body would be comical if it weren\u2019t so damaging. (The town pharmacist must deal with one misguided wife who couldn\u2019t get her husband to use condoms, so she swallowed them herself . . .) Leila comes of age in a culture incapable of recognizing a young woman\u2019s potential and, more damning, unwilling to hear her accusations of sexual abuse. Her father\u2019s efforts to rein in Leila\u2019s undisciplined behavior only leads to more intolerable treatment until she finally flees to the capital with nothing.\n\n\n\nThe author Elif Shafak. (Zeynel Abidin)\n\nThese early sections of the novel are a heartbreaking portrayal of the way misogynist social and religious attitudes conspire to crush a girl\u2019s spirit. Shafak demonstrates with piercing insight how young Muslim women in Turkey are caught between religious ideals of purity and male fantasies of debasement. Running away from home to avoid further abuse, Leila inevitably falls into the very dangers her father imagined he was saving her from. The result is a scathing critique of a culture that pretends to protect the honor of women but casts them off with fierce enthusiasm.\n\nThat bleak plotline, though, is repeatedly interrupted by short anecdotes of kindness, countervailing moments of friendship between Leila and other outcasts. A trans woman, a shy boy, a prostitute from Africa: Shafak introduces these reviled people and others until they constitute Leila\u2019s \u201cwater family,\u201d as opposed to the \u201cblood family\u201d that rejected her. This community of radical loyalty exists outside the officially pious culture of Turkey in the penumbra of its sexual hypocrisy.\n\nWith Leila\u2019s fate sealed on the opening page, \u201c10 Minutes\u201d would seem to offer little suspense, but Shafak is a master of captivating moments that provide a sprawling and intimate vision of Istanbul, \u201ca city of scars.\u201d Although we know from the start that Leila is dead, the novel brings us back to her demise only after we\u2019re fully invested in her difficult life, hoping against hope that her fate might somehow be recast. And, in a way, it is.\n\nWhat\u2019s most surprising, though, is the novel\u2019s bright humor, even, at times, its zaniness: Weekend at Byzantine Bernie\u2019s! That could seem jarringly inappropriate from anybody else, but Shafak writes with a kind of tenderness that embraces the divine comedy of these poor souls. Ultimately, \u201c10 Minutes\u201d isn\u2019t really about death, but the persistence of love. Without ever losing her grip on the tragedy of Leila\u2019s experience \u2014 and the experiences of so many Turkish women like her \u2014 Shafak celebrates her brave, compassionate life.\n\nIn that way, this is a novel determined to pay attention to the most alienated, those people discarded in Istanbul\u2019s Cemetery of the Companionless. Leila\u2019s ragtag friends, scorned and mocked by polite society, can\u2019t possibly triumph over the forces of religious and political corruption, but they \u2014 and Shafak \u2014 manage to create something truly subversive: a community of devotion beyond the reach of state or mosque.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.", "description": "\u201c10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World\u201d is a scathing critique of her country\u2019s cultural hypocrisy.", "authors": ["Ron Charles", "Critic", "Book World", "September At Am", "Ron Charles Writes About Books For The Washington Post.
