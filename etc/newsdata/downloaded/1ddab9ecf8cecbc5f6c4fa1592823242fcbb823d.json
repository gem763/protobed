Swiss star-gazers Michel Mayor, 77, and Didier Queloz, 53, both of the University of Geneva, were honored for finding an exoplanet \u2014 a planet outside our solar system \u2014 that orbits a sun-like star, the Nobel committee said.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Nobel laureates in physics have painted a picture of the universe far stranger and more wonderful than we ever could have imagined,\u201d said Ulf Danielsson of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which selected the laureates. \u201cOur view of our place in the universe will never be the same again.\u201d\n\nPeebles, hailed as one of the most influential cosmologists of his time who realized the importance of the cosmic radiation background born of the Big Bang, will collect one half of the 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award. Mayor, who is an astrophysicist, and Queloz, an astronomer who is also at the University of Cambridge in Britain, will share the other half.\n\nThe Nobel committee said Peebles\u2019 theoretical framework about the cosmos \u2014 and its billions of galaxies and galaxy clusters \u2014 amounted to \u201cthe foundation of our modern understanding of the universe\u2019s history, from the Big Bang to the present day.\u201d\n\nHis work, which began in the mid-1960s, set the stage for a \u201ctransformation\u201d of cosmology over the last half-century, using theoretical tools and calculations that helped interpret traces from the infancy of the universe, the committee said.\n\nA clearly delighted Peebles giggled repeatedly during a phone interview with The Associated Press, recalling how he answered a 5:30 a.m. phone call from Stockholm thinking that \u201cit\u2019s either something very wonderful or it\u2019s something horrible.\u201d\n\nPeebles said he told his wife about the award, \u201cAnd of course her reaction was, \u2018Oh my God!'\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a peaceful life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s somehow now totally messed up!\u201d\n\nMayor and Queloz were credited having \u201cstarted a revolution in astronomy\u201d notably with the discovery of exoplanet 51 Pegasi B, a gaseous ball comparable with Jupiter, in 1995 \u2014 a time when, as Mayor recalled \u2014 that \u201cno one knew whether exoplanets existed or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrestigious astronomers had been searching for them for years, in vain!\u201d Mayor quipped.\n\nThe committee said more than 4,000 exoplanets have since been found in the Milky Way since then.\n\n\u201cMayor and Queloz pioneered the path that will allow our generation to address one of the most exciting questions in science: Are we alone?\u201d wrote Avi Loeb, chair of the Harvard University astronomy department, in an e-mail.\n\n\u201cWe now know that about a quarter of all stars have a planet of Earth\u2019s size and surface temperature, with the potential of hosting liquid water and the chemistry of life on its surface,\u201d he said.\n\nQueloz was meeting with other academics interested in finding new planets when the press office at Cambridge University interrupted to tell him the big news: He had won the Nobel. He thought it was joke at first.\n\n\u201cI could barely breathe,\u201d Queloz told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s enormous. It\u2019s beyond usual emotions. My hand was shaking for a long time. I\u2019m trying to digest it.\u201d\n\nSwedish academy member Mats Larsson said this year\u2019s was \u201cone of the easiest physics prizes for a long time to explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there are a hundred billion planetary systems, with maybe 10 billion planetary systems with Earth-like planets, it would be highly unlikely and against all physical theories to assume that life only developed on our planet,\u201d he added.\n\nThe cash prize comes with a gold medal and a diploma that are received at an elegant ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of prize founder Alfred Nobel in 1896, together with five other Nobel winners. The sixth one, the peace prize, is handed out in Oslo, Norway on the same day.\n\nThis was the 113th Nobel Prize in Physics awarded since 1901, of which 47 awards have been given to a single laureate. Only three women have been awarded it so far: Marie Curie in 1903, Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1963 and Donna Strickland in 2018, according to the Nobel website.\n\nOn Monday, Americans William G. Kaelin Jr. and Gregg L. Semenza and Britain\u2019s Peter J. Ratcliffe won the Nobel prize for Physiology or Medicine, for discovering details of how the body\u2019s cells sense and react to low oxygen levels, providing a foothold for developing new treatments for anemia, cancer and other diseases.\n\nNobel, a Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite, decided the physics, chemistry, medicine and literature prizes should be awarded in Stockholm, and the peace prize in Oslo.\n\nThe Nobel Prize for Chemistry will be announced Wednesday, two Literature Prizes will be awarded on Thursday, and the Peace Prize comes Friday. This year will see two literature Prizes handed out because the one last year was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy.\n\n___\n\nJan M.
