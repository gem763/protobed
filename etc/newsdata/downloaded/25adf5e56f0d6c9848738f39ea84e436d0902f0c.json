The report comes as the Democrat National Committee tightened the polling and fundraising requirements for the winter debate. According to Politico, \u201ccandidates must receive 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early-voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) \u2014 or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early-state polls.\u201d Further, White House contenders are required to have 200,000 unique donors and at least 800 donors in 20 states, the District of Columbia, or other U.S. territories.\n\nThe tighter debate requirements will put pressure on struggling and middle-tier candidates to boost their approval ratings and fundraising efforts. Based on Politico\u2019s presidential tracker, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have already qualified for the sixth debate.\n\nFormer Rep. Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke and technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang said they have met the donor thresholds for the December event.\n\nThe debate\u2019s qualification deadline is December 12th.", "description": "PBS and Politico will team up to co-host the sixth Democrat presidential primary debate in\u00a0Los Angeles in December, according to a report.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181314032-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
