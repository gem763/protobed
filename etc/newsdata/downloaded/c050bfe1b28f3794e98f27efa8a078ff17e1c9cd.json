(Marijan Murat/Getty Images)\n\nRussian Angelina Melnikova was in the middle of her qualifying floor routine on Saturday when the unthinkable happened: Her hair came loose.\n\nMelnikova started out her routine at the world championships in Stuttgart, Germany, with her hair up in a bun, like most gymnasts do. Yet after a tumbling pass early in her routine, her hair popped out of the bun \u2014 and could be seen repeatedly hitting her in the face and swirling around her head throughout the rest of her routine.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMid-routine hair change is what we came to #Stuttgart2019 for. \ud83d\udc51 pic.twitter.com/J0HcKMhL2t \u2014 Pamchenko Twist (@Pamchenkova) October 5, 2019\n\n\u201cActually, when I was coming up to floor, I checked my bun and thought about whether I should re-do it, but I decided not to,\u201d Melnikova said. \u201cOn the second pass, it came undone, and the rest of the floor routine I was just thinking about my hair, that it didn't get in my eye or anything because I know how much it can bother you.\u201d\n\n\"If it was in training, I would have stopped and changed it, but here I couldn't stop...\"\n\n\n\nAngelina reacts to her hair coming undone mid flip!

American Sunisa Lee later posted a 14.2, and then Simone Biles came through and grabbed a dominant lead with a 14.833, sending Melnikova to third.\n\nStill, surviving the routine after what could have been an extremely distracting hair malfunction is impressive nonetheless.\n\n\u201cOf course, if it was in training, I would have stopped and changed it,\u201d Melnikova said, \u201cBut here I couldn't stop, so I was just thinking about it. I hoped it wouldn't get in my eye.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Even with her hair coming loose in the middle of her routine, Russian Angelina Melnikova still posted the third best score of the day in Germany.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GL1BD5x.1MfAsRzf3OjMHg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03NzYuNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/O9zx9_RD8l9YwI7UcTU7MA--~B/aD0yMjQxO3c9MzY5NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/44bee170-e7c3-11e9-ba2d-1cd55f952169", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
