Although police said they are investigating these killings, no arrests have yet been made.\n\nIn tandem with moves restricting political activity, Tanzania\u2019s media has seen increasing censorship and scrutiny under a new Media Services Act with at least six media outlets suspended for publishing stories about corruption and human rights violations.\n\nBeyond suspension and threats, journalists in Tanzania have also faced arbitrary arrests and prosecutions. In one extreme case, journalist Azory Gwanda disappeared under mysterious circumstances in November 2017.\n\nIn one of the most high-profile cases earlier this year, police arrested investigative reporter Erick Kabendera. Public statements suggested he had been questioned about the validity of his Tanzanian nationality and later interrogated for alleged sedition and publication of false information in an Economist article he wrote.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Investigative journalist Erick Kabendera was reportedly interrogated over his work for the Economist. Photograph: STRINGER/Reuters\n\n\u201cAs President Magufuli marks four years in office next month, he must carefully reflect on his government\u2019s record of ruthlessly disemboweling the country\u2019s human rights framework,\u201d said Roland Ebole, Amnesty International\u2019s Tanzania researcher. \u201cHis government must repeal all oppressive laws being used to clamp down on dissent, and urgently end human rights violations and abuses.\u201d\n\nOryem Nyeko, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, added: \u201cTanzania should show true commitment to protecting and fulfilling the rights to freedom of expression and association. The authorities need to put a stop to harassment, intimidation and arbitrary arrests of activists, journalists and opposition members.\u201d\n\nThe authorities need to put a stop to harassment, intimidation and arbitrary arrests of activists Oryem Nyeko, Human Rights Watch\n\nBoth Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch found that Tanzanian authorities had undermined the rights to freedom of expression and media freedom by enforcing repressive new and existing laws and regulations governing the media, NGOs and political parties. The reports were researched and documented separately, but their findings were similar.\n\n\n\nJust days after taking office in late 2015, Magufuli cancelled the symbolic independence day fete and used funds for the event to widen a part of a highway notorious for gridlocks in Dar es Salaam. He also fired a number of senior government figures in an anti-corruption crusade. The moves were initially well received.\n\nFast forward to 2019 and opinion about him and his regime is more divided.\n\nMagufuli, who is leader of the ruling Party of the Revolution (Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or CCM) earned his nickname while public works minister, when he removed thousands of ghost workers from the payroll and purged incompetent civil servants.\n\nAlarm over cases of disease with Ebola-like symptoms in Tanzania Read more\n\nSince becoming president he has acquired a reputation for authoritarian and peremptory announcements which have caused friction with international organisations, including the World Health Organization, which was refused data over a suspected case of the deadly ebola virus earlier this year.\n\nEarlier this month he publicly backed an official who sparked outrage and violated the country\u2019s rules by beating more than a dozen students with a stick. Magufuli urged parents and school teachers to do the same in order to build a disciplined nation.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Amnesty and Human Rights Watch raise concerns over rising levels of abuses against activists, opponents and the press", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42e6f9f179312eec4c618a322f7f224ccc388b6b/0_79_3853_2312/master/3853.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=36ea458beba362bbac6f335b6f090ca8", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
