And the teases have already started. Over the past week or so, in the lead-up to season 10, a massive robot has slowly been assembled inside of a now-dormant volcano (the same one that erupted in season 8, drastically changing Fortnite\u2019s island).\n\nIt started with a mysterious metal foot appearing, and for the last few days a giant, headless mech dominated the island\u2019s landscape. Now the mechanical creation is finished and it looks like a cross between Voltron and Fortnite\u2019s iconic Cuddle Team Leader character. You can check out the towering robot in the game right now.\n\nEarlier this season, a giant monster, which had been frozen beneath a castle, began swimming around the island. This, combined with the robot, has led many to believe that a Pacific Rim-style mech-vs-kaiju battle is on the horizon. There have been other small changes around the map as well. The massive power cord that runs from Loot Lake to Neo Tilted has been slightly damaged, and there are various warning signs in the city along with Mega Mall, suggesting a change is on the way for the game\u2019s more futuristic locations.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, we at least know when it\u2019ll be happening. Along with the construction of the robot, a series of countdown clocks have also popped up across the island, at each of the floating sky platforms. According to the countdown, you\u2019ll want to be in the game on Saturday, July 20th, at 2PM ET.\n\nWhatever ends up happening, these kinds of world-changing events are becoming the norm for Fortnite, particularly when it comes time to kick off a new season. Previous events have included a dramatic rocket launch, an in-game Marshmello concert, a rolling purple cube that opened a portal to a different dimension, and a massive snowstorm created by an undead ice king. With giant robots and monsters, the latest is shaping up to be the biggest yet.\n\nFortnite season 9 is slated to end on August 1st, just days after the $30 million Fortnite World Cup in New York.\n\nAlong with the new pink mech, Fortnite has also been updated to version 9.40, which includes a handful of minor changes. The most notable is the addition of new legendary and epic variants of the tactical shotgun.
