So by the end of the drive, Patrick Mahomes already had thrown for 116 yards and the touchdown.\n\n- Dave Skretta reporting from Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n___\n\n1:10 p.m.\n\nThe early games have started off with a burst. Literally.\n\nBrandon Wilson took the opening kickoff in Baltimore 92 yards for a touchdown, giving Cincinnati a 7-0 lead over the Ravens. Wilson and the Bengals made Baltimore pay for a rare kickoff that Justin Tucker didn\u2019t put out of the end zone.\n\nThat\u2019s the first opening kick returned for a touchdown in the NFL in two years. Pharoh Wilson did it with a 103-yard return in a Rams\u2019 win over the Jaguars in Week 6 in 2017.\n\nIn Cleveland, Dontrell Hilliard didn\u2019t reach the end zone on Seattle\u2019s opening kickoff. But Hilliard went 74 yards down to the Seahawks 23, and Nick Chubb scored three plays later with the Browns taking advantage of the big return.\n\n___\n\nNoon\n\nThe New Orleans Saints got an unexpected - and probably unintentional - backer for their game at Jacksonville.\n\nPope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church, included the Saints\u2019 Twitter logo in a tweet Sunday morning - one New Orleans football fans took as a good omen for their team.\n\n\u201cToday we give thanks to the Lord for our new #Saints. They walked by faith and now we invoke their intercession,\u201d the Pope tweeted after canonizing five new saints at a mass at Vatican City.\n\nThe hashtag and capitalization of Saints added the Fleur de Lis, the emblem associated with the Saints and worn on the team\u2019s helmets.\n\nPeople certainly noticed as one person wrote, \u201cWho Dat, father?\u201d At least one Saints player took the tweet as a good sign: \u201cWow, are we blessed or what?!??\u201d\n\n- Mark Long reporting from Jacksonville, Florida.\n\n___\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nCarolina\u2019s Joey Slye missed a 60-yard attempt on a rare free kick for a field goal at the end of the first half against Tampa Bay.\n\nSlye got his opportunity after the Panthers called for a fair catch at midfield with 1 second left in the half. Tampa Bay had false-started three straight times before the punt.\n\nThe Panthers chose the option of a free kick. That allowed Slye to kick from the 50 with the Bucs players forced to remain 10 yards back. The kick went wide right and Carolina\u2019s lead remained 17-7 at the break.\n\nThe Panthers used a franchise-record tying six first-half sacks, three takeaways and two Christian McCaffrey touchdowns to take a 17-7 halftime lead in London against the Bucs.\n\n- Josh Dubow reporting from London\n\n___\n\n10:20 a.m.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers have taken a 10-0 lead over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers thanks to a short drive and a long one.\n\nCarolina\u2019s James Bradberry intercepted Jameis Winston on the first play from scrimmage. The Panthers lost 2 yards before settling for a 49-yard field goal from Joey Slye.\n\nCarolina then drove 99 yards for a touchdown after Bradley Pinion\u2019s punt was down at the 1. Kyle Allen went 5-for-5 for 68 yards on the drive and Christian McCaffrey capped it with a 1-yard run on fourth down.\n\nThat was just the second 99-yard drive for Carolina in the past 12 seasons. The Panthers had one last year against Baltimore.\n\nThe Buccaneers hadn\u2019t allowed a 99-yard drive since Nov. 7, 2010, against Atlanta.\n\n- Josh Dubow reporting from London\n\n___\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers got the NFL off to an early start with their meeting in London.\n\nThe two NFC South rivals are playing Sunday at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the second of four games this season in London.\n\nCarolina made defensive Efe Obada an honorary captain for the game. The Nigeria native arrived in England as a 10-year-old after being trafficked with his sister from the Netherlands. Now he\u2019s back here as an NFL player and a star attraction after first picking up the sport of American football at age 22.\n\nThis marks the Panthers\u2019 first regular-season game outside the United States. That leaves the Green Bay Packers as the only team not to have played an International Series game.\n\nSome of the key games in Week 6 after the early start in London include Deshaun Watson and the Houston Texans visiting Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs and an NFC West showdown between the undefeated San Francisco 49ers and the defending NFC champion Los Angeles Rams.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on the NFL's Week 6 (all times EDT):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/vatican_saints_88735_c0-102-2460-1537_s1200x700.jpg?44718d913bfb29afa136b8791b7fe565ed6b5cfc", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
