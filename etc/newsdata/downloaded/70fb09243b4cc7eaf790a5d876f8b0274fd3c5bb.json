And I agree. A fee of \u00a325 is too expensive.\n\nBut \u2013 and I know this will anger many \u2013 I think a charge of some sort is needed.\n\nThe GPs\u2019 magazine GPonline revealed earlier this year that patients fail to attend an estimated 16.4 million appointments a year booked with GPs or other practice staff.\n\nThat\u2019s the equivalent of 375 average GP surgeries opening every day of the year without their doctors seeing a single patient. The findings come after analysis of NHS Digital data.\n\nIn every clinic I sit in, at least one patient fails to show.\n\nOn Friday, for instance, two of our 18 patients booked in for my morning clinic did not show up. Most shockingly, they\u2019d only booked in for their appointment at 8am that morning.\n\nWe call it a DNA \u2013 did not attend \u2013 and there\u2019s rarely a valid reason. Rather it is laziness, disorganisation and profligacy.\n\nFor every no-show, there\u2019s at least 20 patients who are forced to wait weeks, and even months, for a potentially life-saving appointment (stock image, GP surgery)\n\nMeanwhile, for every no-show, there\u2019s at least 20 patients who are forced to wait weeks, and even months, for a potentially life-saving appointment.\n\nAccording to a report out earlier this month, 15 million patients are waiting at least a month to see their doctor. Where I work, the wait is about three weeks, unless it\u2019s a matter of urgency.\n\nI know in my surgery, we have patients queuing outside at 7.30 in the morning. Others, desperate to see someone, resort to turning up at A&E departments.\n\nThe shortage of GPs, dwindling finances and increasing pressures has GP practices across the country bursting at the seams.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the solution?\n\nIt\u2019s a small price to pay to help the NHS\n\nClearly, a \u00a325 charge per missed appointment is ridiculous. It\u2019s the equivalent of most pensioner\u2019s weekly food budget and would price thousands out of GP surgeries. Readers had other, interesting suggestions. One proposed a deposit system, whereby patients pay a small fee of \u00a310 when booking the appointment, but get it back if they show up.\n\nA few, living in Jersey in the Channel Islands, suggested we copied the system they use there, of charging \u00a349 for a GP visit but offering prescriptions and emergency treatment for free. Alternatively, asked another reader, had I considered the French system, whereby patients pay \u20ac25 (\u00a321.50) to the GP directly, but later, via the healthcare system, receive \u20ac23 (\u00a319.80) back. Another suggestion was to levy an \u00a38 charge \u2013 but only for those aged 16 to 60.\n\nHowever, others pointed out some obvious pitfalls. \u2018What happens if the doctor is late, cancels the appointment or asks you to come back for several follow-ups?\u2019 asked one concerned reader.\n\nWell, I think I have the answer: a fee of just 50p that has to be paid when patients book a new appointment. It\u2019s a charge small enough that\u2019s it\u2019s affordable for most, but large enough to teach patients the value of NHS time.\n\nI\u2019ve posed the idea to colleagues and doctor friends, and many disagree with me. The whole point of the NHS, they say, is that it is free at the point of delivery.\n\nOne was sickened by the idea of asking patients for cash.\n\n\u2018You scupper the doctor-patient relationship once money changes hands,\u2019 she said. Another said there wasn\u2019t any point, telling me: \u2018People will come up with excuses about why they can\u2019t pay.\u2019\n\nI told them dogged principles and defeatist attitudes will do nothing to help our increasingly crippled GP services. But a small charge for missed appointments might just.\n\nSame concept as the 5p plastic bag fee\n\nWhat's the point of charging a meagre 50p, you might think.\n\nThe intention is not to leave patients out of pocket, or stop them from visiting the GP. Instead, it is designed to make people think twice about wasting their doctor\u2019s precious time.\n\nIt\u2019s a charge small enough that\u2019s it\u2019s affordable for most, but large enough to teach patients the value of NHS time\n\nThink of it like the 5p charge on plastic bags, introduced in 2015, which saw usage plummet by a staggering 90 per cent. No one thought twice about using the bags before the minuscule charge was introduced. Now, most of us keep a stock of reusable ones in the car boot, even though we\u2019re saving only 10p or 20p.\n\nThe same logic should be applied to GP appointments \u2013 a price, however small, will remind us of their value.\n\nBut wouldn\u2019t collecting money be a logistical nightmare for surgery staff?\n\nWe already manage to charge patients for writing medical reports for solicitors, insurance companies and employers. Some surgeries have card- payment facilities, just like small businesses, so it would be pretty straightforward.\n\nThere would be no need to waste time chasing payments, either. Patients would pay when they book, either by phone or online.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they\u2019d have to come into the surgery to pay following a number of DNAs.\n\nSome gyms make you pay for the next class in person if you haven\u2019t shown up for several.\n\nAs for what to do with the money, well, my local bakery gives their plastic bag tax to a cancer charity \u2013 GP surgeries could do the same.\n\nOr they could use the money to help patients in other ways.\n\nBut a quarter of British doctors think this fee is the key to solving the problem of missed appointments, according to a poll by the magazine Pulse.\n\nI reckon the number of missed appointments would plummet, saving practices thousands of pounds and reducing waiting times in the process.\n\nIt must be said, I write this piece with a heavy heart. I passionately believe our health service should be free at the point of delivery.\n\nBut I\u2019m sick of watching my patients wait nearly a month before they see me.\n\nSo, I call on politicians to consider my reasonable proposal.\n\nIt might not be a vote winner, but if they genuinely care about the NHS, they will seriously consider it.", "description": "DR ELLIE CANNON: In every clinic I sit in, at least one patient fails to show.
