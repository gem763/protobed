It\u2019s a question that the film and TV industries have been increasingly agonising over in the last few years, and which has now led to the rise of a new job on set: that of the intimacy coordinator.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think there was even a role in the profession when I first started developing this work several years ago,\u201d says Ita O\u2019Brien, a former actor turned movement director who specialises as an intimacy coordinator. \u201cNow I can name at least 20 to 30 intimacy coordinators working around the world \u2013 and we\u2019re training up dozens more to meet the demand.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s job is to make sure that actors are comfortable, that boundaries are discussed, and every step of a scene is mutually agreed and choreographed in the same way as a fight, a dance or an action sequence.\n\nIt was HBO\u2019s The Deuce \u2013 an explicit TV drama about the 1970s porn industry \u2013 that helped set a new industry standard in the wake of #MeToo and the Time\u2019s Up campaign. The show, created by David Simon and George Pelecanos, the team behind The Wire, was among the first to hire an intimacy coordinator.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Intimacy director Ita O\u2019Brien.

Rodis\u2019s impact was so huge that Simon pledged to never work without an intimacy coordinator again. HBO followed suit and adopted a policy whereby all shows with intimate scenes are staffed with an intimacy coordinator.\n\nNetflix and Amazon Prime have been quick to respond and are now hiring coordinators to oversee sex scenes across their sets, but terrestrial broadcasters and major theatres still seem to be dragging their feet on the issue.\n\n\u201cI want to have conversations with the National Theatre, with the RSC, with the Globe,\u201d says O\u2019Brien, who has worked with the BBC for Sally Wainwright\u2019s Gentleman Jack, but says \u201cthere is still such a way to go, [particularly] with older directors where there is resistance.\u201d\n\nMy goal is that you don\u2019t have to feel someone else\u2019s genitals at work if you don\u2019t want to Elizabeth Talbot, intimacy coordinator\n\nElizabeth Talbot, who runs IDI in the UK, has been run off her feet in the last year. \u201cThe last six months has seen a huge uptick,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that our industry was very unsafe for actors. A lot of it wasn\u2019t malicious, but it was uninformed. If you don\u2019t have intentions to keep actors and actresses safe when they\u2019re simulating sex, or info on how to do that, then everyone is sort of winging it. My goal is that you don\u2019t have to feel someone else\u2019s genitals at work if you don\u2019t want to; we make sure we advocate for actors and actresses when they feel too vulnerable or unsure to do it themselves.\u201d\n\nDespite the advantages, not everyone is keen. When Equity adopted safe-sex scene guidelines, the actor Andy Serkis accused the union of \u201ccreative censorship\u201d and suggested that actors and directors should arrive at an agreement together. But it\u2019s because those conversations haven\u2019t happened that makes her work so crucial, says O\u2019Brien. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with quite a few young actresses and they\u2019re so appreciative that there is someone on set advocating for them and establishing boundaries.\u201d\n\nBoth O\u2019Brien and Talbot think their jobs will become standardised across the acting profession within the next five years. \u201cIt was incredibly difficult for people to take us seriously when we were trying to get this off the ground,\u201d says Talbot. \u201cThere was a natural assumption that everyone has sex and actors can coordinate it themselves. The easiest way to equate what we do is to think of a fight on set, where a fight coordinator is hired to make sure everyone is safe while making the most authentic-looking scene possible. Intimacy is in a similar vein.\u201d", "description": "In the wake of #MeToo, scenes are being choreographed like fights or dances to set boundaries for actors", "authors": ["Nosheen Iqbal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/757dca6b6c44e5170462078ed5e5813cb6784587/0_222_4040_2424/master/4040.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=628740e1b9810e23ab6e817d03574513", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
