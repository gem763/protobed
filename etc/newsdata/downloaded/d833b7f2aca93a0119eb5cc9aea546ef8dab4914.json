She died of spinal meningitis .\n\nHe admitted at Glasgow High Court that he had \u201ctotally failed\u201d his wife and wished he was dead.\n\nBut the jury cleared him of culpable homicide by majority verdict, resulting in the sisters confronting him as he left court.\n\n(Image: Jamie Williamson)\n\nKatie Friel shouted at Crilley: \u201cYou evil b******. You killed my sister\u201d as he walked to his car.\n\nKatie, 58, told the Record: \u201cWe wanted to bury our sister in dignity but the legal process and the police investigation meant it was six months before the funeral took place.\n\n\u201cAfter Neil took us to court we were devastated when a sheriff took his side and said he could look after the funeral arrangements.\n\n\"We had already booked our own undertakers and we would have had a regular ceremony that would have people who loved Maureen in attendance.\u201d\n\n(Image: Jamie Williamson)\n\nKatie had booked with Co-op Funeralcare but the funeral director later informed her that Crilley had been in with a legal document to state he had responsibility for her funeral.\n\nThe procurator fiscal was notified of the challenge and a decision was made that Maureen\u2019s body should not be released until the matter was sorted out.\n\nIn a writ, Crilley also sought to compel the Lord Advocate James Wolffe to intervene and rule in his favour.\n\nIn the meantime he bought a headstone which he erected in December 2017 at a plot at North Dalnottar Cemetery in Clydebank.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nThe former BAE Systems worker regularly visited the plot and laid flowers , despite the fact his wife\u2019s body was being held in cold storage at a hospital miles away.\n\nKatie said: \u201cBefore the service, Neil told staff at the hospital, where Maureen\u2019s body was stored, that she had no immediate family. He was determined to have his secret service and to cut us off completely, just as we had been when Maureen was alive.\n\n\u201cWe found out from a source when the graveside ceremony was taking place at the last minute and we were able to turn up.\n\n\"Neil just ignored us but we took our place at the gravestone and we were able to throw earth on the coffin. There wasn\u2019t much he could do about it to be honest.\n\n(Image: Jamie Williamson)\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have been forced to do that. It was like gatecrashing our own sister\u2019s funeral was inhuman to deny us the right to be there.\u201d\n\nKatie claimed Maureen had been cut off from her family by loner Crilley.\n\nThe service at the graveside was only attended by two other people, a couple that Neil had invited along.\n\nKatie said: \u201cWe always believed that Neil was a controlling and manipulative man.\n\n(Image: Iain McLellan/Spindrift Photo Agency)\n\n\u201cWhat kind of man leaves his wife lying on a floor for eight weeks when she is clearly dying?\n\n\u201cWe had to hear the details as they came out and it was appalling to hear what he had allowed to happen.\n\n\u201cNeil also asked an ambulanceman if he was going to get the jail as he finally arranged for Maureen to go to hospital.\n\n\"That doesn\u2019t sound like remorse to me. He was thinking about himself, not Maureen and her suffering. We can hardly believe he got away with this.\u201d\n\nCrilley\u2019s legal case at Glasgow Sheriff Court was based on the fact he had not been convicted of any crime and therefore was Maureen\u2019s rightful next of kin.\n\nHe told Katie he would be seeking to carry out his wife\u2019s wishes to be buried with only him at the graveside.\n\nKatie said sisters Margaret, 68, May, 65, and Helen, 63, earlier told how they were perplexed to see Crilley lay flowers at Maureen\u2019s graveside before she had been buried.", "description": "Neil Crilley refused to call an ambulance for his wife Maureen until she was so ill her brain was infected with puss", "authors": ["Mark Mcgivern", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Daily Record", "Jamie Williamson", "Iain Mclellan Spindrift Photo Agency"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645600.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-sct_JW_52594JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
