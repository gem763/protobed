Thomas Road, at which Pizza Hut will also be testing a pizza with a plant-based \"meat\" topping called \"Incogmeato.\" Incogmeato is an all-new plant-based \"meat\" from Kellogg-owned Morningstar Farms and will be served on a Garden Specialty Pizza.\n\nThe round pizza box and Garden Specialty Pizza will be sold together for $10 in store, while supplies last.\n\n\"This revolutionary round box \u2014 the result of a two year journey \u2014 is the most innovative packaging we've rolled out to date,\" Pizza Hut's chief customer and operations officer, Nicolas Burquier, said in a press release. \"The round box was engineered to make our products taste even better \u2014 by delivering hotter, crispier pizzas.\"\n\nThe box stacks and interlocks, and it's also compostable. Courtesy of Pizza Hut\n\nThe round box uses less space and fewer materials than a traditional square pizza box, and it is also industrially compostable, according to the chain. Boxes stack and interlock in order to simplify the delivery process.\n\n\"When you put pizza on a flat surface, it cools off and the moisture is absorbed into the box. As the pizza gets cold, the moisture is absorbed back into the pizza,\" Zume founder and CEO Alex Garden told Business Insider. \"So we created this box where we have the pizza sitting on a raised cushion and air actually circulates so it stays crispy all the time.\"\n\nAll proceeds from the event's sales will be donated to Arizona Forward, a sustainability organization based in Phoenix. The chain said that after the one-day test, it will be looking into a wider launch of the round box.", "description": "Pizza Hut has partnered with Zume to test a new round pizza box that is supposed to keep pizza fresher and crispier.
