Elsen suffered puncture wounds to her face and arm and lost part of her finger. Rupert suffered a fractured hip after he jumped in to protect his wife but was discharged from the hospital later that day.\n\nAfter the attack, wildlife officials had animal hair found at the scene tested, revealing the attacker was a raccoon, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Wildlife authorities had found it hard to believe the attack could have come from a bobcat, as the animals are typically shy around humans.\n\nUBER DRIVER WHO FATALLY SHOT DRUNKEN PASSENGER NOT GUILTY OF MURDER\n\n\"I have never heard of anything like this,\" said Carole Baskin, founder and CEO of Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, which houses 20 bobcats among other animals. \"Any wild bobcat is not going to walk up to a human.
