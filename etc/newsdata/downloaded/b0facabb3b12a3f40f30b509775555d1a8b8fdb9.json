After his sentence he will be banned from gaming for two years.\n\nViner said he was \"awfully sorry\", that he never intended anything to happen and he thinks of it every day.\n\n\"We impose sentences not only for what people intend, but what happened,\" said US District Judge Eric Melgren.\n\nHow did a prank call kill an innocent man?\n\nA \"swatting\" call is a hoax phone call designed to make special weapons and tactics (Swat) police raid a target's house.\n\nOn 28 December 2017, Barriss told police he had shot his father and was holding the rest of his family hostage.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Tyler Barriss pleaded guilty to a total of 51 charges\n\nHe gave police what he thought was Mr Gaskill's address in Kansas.\n\nHowever, the address provided by Mr Gaskill was not his own but that of Mr Finch, 28.\n\nArmed police went to the property and shot dead Mr Finch, who had no involvement in the video game dispute.\n\nPolice say the responding officer shot Mr Finch after he moved his hands towards his waist.\n\nUS Attorney Stephen McAllister described swatting as \"reckless, dangerous and, as this case proves, potentially tragic\".\n\nThe police officer involved was not charged as there was not enough evidence to show they acted unreasonably considering the context.\n\n\"Swatting is not a prank, and it is no way to resolve disputes among gamers,\" Mr McAllister added, calling on gamers to \"self-police their community to ensure that the practice of swatting is ended once and for all\".", "description": "Casey Viner, 19, ordered the prank call after an argument while playing Call of Duty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05sdfhw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
