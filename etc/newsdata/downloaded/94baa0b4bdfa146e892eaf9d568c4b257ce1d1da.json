Let\u2019s at least have a reasoned and deliberate conversation about some lesser kind of response.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStarr thinks Congress should consider censuring President Trump, and he says Republicans in 1998 should have considered \u201cwhether something short of impeachment would be appropriate.\u201d\n\nNow he tells us? He didn\u2019t mention \u201ccensure\u201d once in his referral to Congress in 1998 laying out \u201csubstantial and credible information that President Clinton committed acts that may constitute grounds for an impeachment,\u201d nor in his November 1998 testimony. Then, Starr argued passionately that Clinton\u2019s actions fit the \u201chigh-crime-and-misdemeanor\u201d standard.\n\nStarr wasn\u2019t finished. During this week\u2019s interview, he also absolved Trump of guilt, both for obstruction of justice in the Mueller inquiry and for wrongdoing in the Ukraine quid pro quo, saying Trump\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d was pure. Starr protested that Trump \u201cis being held to a remarkable standard\u201d in which we are \u201cover-criminalizing the conduct of the business of government.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeriously? From the man who pushed to impeach a president for lying about oral sex in a civil deposition? Back then, Starr rejected the argument that Clinton\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d in lying was to avoid embarrassment, not to perjure himself.\n\nStarr, still going, suggested this week that impeachment is a plot by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to seize the presidency. A \u201cconflict of interest is that the speaker of the House is guiding this process when she is third in succession,\u201d he argued. \u201cShe will do well if she can have the elimination of Donald Trump from office and then Vice President Pence somehow.\u201d\n\nSomehow?\n\nThe brazenness of Starr\u2019s historical revision was largely lost amid a profusion of equally outrageous attempts to excuse Trump.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an Iraq veteran with a Purple Heart who had come to the United States as a 3-year-old Jewish refugee from the Soviet Union, delivered damning testimony to the impeachment inquiry. In a grotesque attempt to discredit Vindman, who now serves on the National Security Council, former Wisconsin representative Sean Duffy questioned Vindman\u2019s loyalty on CNN: \u201cHe has an affinity, I think, for the Ukraine. He speaks Ukrainian.\u201d On Fox News, hosts Laura Ingraham and Brian Kilmeade attempted similar smears, as did guest John Yoo. (A week earlier, the White House slimed another witness \u2014 career diplomat, Vietnam veteran and West Point graduate William B. Taylor Jr. \u2014 as a \u201cradical unelected bureaucrat.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nOthers were just a notch below such calumny. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) alleged that Democrats, not Trump, had held up aid to Ukraine \u2014 because of a border-wall dispute over next year\u2019s defense spending. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), after howling about the need for an impeachment resolution with transparency and due process, condemned Democrats for proposing exactly that. And Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), in the impeachment inquiry, continued his quest to unmask the original whistleblower \u2014 even though most of the information has been corroborated.\n\nTrump himself tweeted that what Pelosi is doing is \u201cjust the oppidite\u201d of good politics and again said \u201cShifty Adam Schiff . . . should be impeached\u201d (a legal impossibility). A day earlier, Trump\u2019s campaign began selling \u201cStop the Witch Hunt\u201d T-shirts with a \u201cHoaxus Pocus\u201d theme.\n\nAD\n\nBut in terms of audacity, it\u2019s tough to top Starr. During this week\u2019s interview, he argued that while the impeachment of Clinton for lying about an affair was a \u201cmatter of conscience\u201d for Congress, the prospective impeachment of Trump for betraying national security and breaking campaign-finance law is not.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRepublicans were, in fact, proceeding in good faith and with a very substantial basis because the president was \u2014 and virtually everyone agreed with this \u2014 guilty of very serious offenses against the rule of law, particularly perjury and obstruction of justice,\u201d said Starr, moments after dismissing the Mueller report\u2019s evidence of Trump\u2019s obstruction of justice.\n\n\u201cEveryone with reason accepted the proposition that Bill Clinton committed crimes,\u201d he added. \u201cThere I don\u2019t think will ever come a point where all persons of good faith agree, let\u2019s call it a consensus, that [Trump] stepped across the line.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis is probably true \u2014 not because Trump\u2019s crimes are less serious, but because Republicans have abandoned good faith.\n\nInterested in following Dana Milbank\u2019s take on the impeachment inquiry?
