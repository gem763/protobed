They spent time with their owners for two minutes in an unfamiliar room, then the owners left for two minutes, and then the owners returned for another two minutes.\n\nINDONESIA FIRES TURN SKY AN EERIE BLOOD RED\n\n45 GOOGLE EMPLOYEES CLAIM RETALIATION AFTER REPORTING HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION AND ABUSE\n\nAccording to attachment theory, the different setting would make some cats stressed out without their humans present.\n\nUpon being reunited with their owners, the scientists then watched how the cats behaved upon seeing their owner again. About 65 percent of the cats and kittens were found to be securely bonded to their owners, according to the study.\n\nThe bonding finding gives the researchers hope for how many cats could be placed in homes in the future, especially given how many cats and kittens are present in animal shelters.\n\nThe study, which was reportedly supported by a Nestle Purina sponsorship for research on the well-being of cats, was published in the journal Cell Press.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Although cats have a reputation for being aloof, a new study says they respond to and bond with humans in a manner similar to dogs.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/cat-getty-images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
