They could have family problems. They might have a parent in prison. And another challenge is the gang culture.\n\n\u201cTraditionally a few years ago what you would have had is a young person would come to you and say \u2018I have got a problem\u2019 and that is it.\n\n\u201cBut now they come to you and say \u2018I have got a problem with a gang. I also have a problem with a family member and I also have a problem with my mental health\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe number of referrals to the college\u2019s safeguarding team more than doubled last year, she said.\n\n\u201cWe are not funded for all the additional staffing and support we need to put in place to deal with complex cases,\u201d Ms McManus added. \u201cIt is a worry.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson recently pledged an extra \u00a3400m of funding for sixth forms and colleges for next year.\n\nBut a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) last month said the extra cash will still leave colleges \u00a31.1bn short of what they need to reverse cuts felt over the past nine years,\n\nSchool sixth forms have faced budget cuts of 23 per cent since 2010-2011 and spending for colleges have declined by 12 per cent over the same period, the economic think tank report shows.\n\nColleges are also facing challenges in meeting the needs of a growing number of students who end up in alternative provision (AP) during their GCSEs and then progress into colleges as current funding gaps means a drop of on average of \u00a36,000 per pupil, according to the report from the AoC.\n\nDavid Hughes, chief executive of the AoC, warned of a real risk of cash-strapped further education colleges not being able to offer bespoke support to all those who need it amid a lack of funding.\n\nHe added that the right resources to colleges can help young people \u201cturn their lives around\u201d and prevent them from \u201ctaking the wrong path to crime or drugs\u201d.\n\nMr Hughes said: \u201cThere are growing challenges for colleges supporting the rising number of young people who were not at school during their GCSE years due to off-rolling, home schooling or exclusion.\n\n\u201cTheir needs can be complex and while colleges offer safe, positive and transformative educational experiences for these young people, they need sufficient funding to keep up with the demand.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTo allow colleges to have the best chance of meeting their needs, which are sometimes combined with mental health and behavioural issues, there needs to be a joined up sharing of data and for local authorities to undertake education, health and care plans when requested.\u201d\n\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said he would not be surprised if the number of pupils out of school at GCSE had increased as he believes austerity has \u201ceroded the infrastructure of support around vulnerable young people and caused disengagement\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe do need to develop better systems for providing colleges with the information they need about this vulnerable group of students.\n\n\u201cIt is challenging because these young people will have been through a turbulent period, there may be an incomplete picture of what contact they have had with mental health services and other agencies, and they may not even have been able to access support due to cutbacks to these services.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Angela Rayner, shadow education secretary, said: \u201cOur colleges have borne the brunt of Tory cuts to our education system, with many pushed to the brink of collapse.\n\n\u201cCollege principals are being asked to do more with less. After billions have been cut from further education and adult education budgets since 2010, funding is urgently needed to enable teachers and support staff to support students.\u201d\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) has been approached for a comment.", "description": "Colleges are struggling to meet the needs of a growing number of students who have been excluded, \u201coff-rolled\u201d or home-schooled during their GCSE years amid \u201cinsufficient\u201d funding, according to a new report.\u00a0 Staff in further education colleges are being given \u201cinadequate\u201d handover information about teenagers who have dropped out of school between 14 and 16 and who arrive with", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/06/15/23/SixthForm-Alamy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
