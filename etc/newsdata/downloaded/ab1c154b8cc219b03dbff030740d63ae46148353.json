Worse still, when they are over-consumed or mixed with alcohol or other legal drugs, they can be lethal.

And there\u2019s no end in sight. Millions continue to suffer from a physical dependence to these drugs, including a large percentage who are addicted. Tens of thousands of these patients will suffer a very untimely demise. Yet a similarly disturbing trend is now emerging in the UK.\n\nThe true extent of Britain\u2019s already entrenched opioid crisis was recently laid bare in a review published last month by Public Health England. It revealed that one in four UK adults are now being prescribed either strong painkillers, antidepressants, sleeping pills or anti-anxiety medication \u2013 totalling 12 million people.\n\nThis includes five million people being prescribed opioids, numbering one in eight adults. In fact, the UK now has the world\u2019s fastest-growing rate of opioid use. Prescriptions have risen by 22 per cent from a decade ago to 40 million per year. And an estimated 540,00 Britons are already addicted.\n\nThe trouble is opioids should not normally be taken for more than a few weeks, according to the NHS guidelines. Yet patients often find themselves becoming dependent on them for years at a time because doctors cannot offer any viable alternatives, especially for chronic pain.\n\nYet withdrawing from opioids can be a physically and psychologically torturous experience akin to withdrawing from heroin abuse. Even the NHS admits that very nasty side effects normally occur during patients\u2019 protracted detoxification process.\n\nUnfortunately, the NHS has yet to come up with particularly successful treatments for opioid dependence and addiction. Hence, the shocking statistics in the Public Health England report.\n\nIn response to its publication, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, went into damage control mode by declaring his intention to fix this broken system: \"I\u2019m incredibly concerned by this new evidence about the impact over-medicalisation is having\u2026I refuse to let this escalate to the level seen in the United States. This review is a wake-up call\u2026\"\n\nSo if Hancock is looking to the US as a cautionary tale, he must also be cognizant of the powerful role that medical cannabis is now playing across the pond as a safer alternative to dangerous opioids.\n\nAs the UK approaches the one-year anniversary of the legalisation of medical cannabis, it\u2019s time for Hancock to acknowledge cannabis's rightful place in Britain\u2019s modern-day pharmacopeia. He can clearly see what it has done to alleviate the opioid crisis in the US. And it\u2019s time for him to throw British medical patients the same lifeline that North Americans are finding to be extraordinarily therapeutic, and even life-saving in many cases.\n\nConsider this: in American states where cannabis is legal for medical uses, prescriptions for opioids and anti-depressants have fallen on average almost 30 per cent. Additionally, government data in the US now suggests that prescribing medical cannabis can prevent around 31 per cent of the deaths associated with opioid addiction each year.\n\nIt bears repeating that medical cannabis is a non-toxic alternative to opioids that is not considered to be physiologically addictive. And no-one has ever died from consuming too much cannabis or from mixing it with other legal or illegal drugs.\n\nWith this in mind, what are you waiting for, Hancock? The \u201cwake up call\u201d that you refer to is for your own government. Give medical cannabis a chance to give opioid-dependant patients their lives back before it\u2019s too late to save them.\n\nMarc Davis is a global cannabis expert", "description": "For much of the 20th century, the UK and much of the developed world have been engaged in an expensive and ineffective war on cannabis \u2013 a psychoactive herbal drug that is not known to have ever poisoned or killed anyone.", "authors": ["Marc Davis"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/07/17/medical-cannabis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
