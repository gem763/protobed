You will be able to read the entire issue if you are an NRPLUS subscriber (there\u2019s a limit if you\u2019re not), and considering the cover pieces alone, we\u2019re confident you wish you were. But about the issue: the primo pieces are excerpts from two long-awaited books, sure to be the instigators of major conservative debate and discussion. There\u2019s the big-and-important selection from Rich Lowry\u2019s The Case for Nationalism: How It Made Us Powerful, United, and Free, and a major slice from Richard Brookhiser\u2019s forthcoming Give Me Liberty: A History of America\u2019s Exceptional Idea (the selection is from Rick\u2019s chapter on the 1785 creation of the New York Manumission Society \u2014 it\u2019s a true history lesson). Both books share the formal publication date of November 5.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom start to finish, every piece in the new issue merits your attention and interest, but we\u2019ll use this opportunity to recommend just three additional articles: Jay Nordlinger\u2019s profile of Tanya Chan, a leader of the Hong Kong freedom movement; Ramesh Ponnuru\u2019s commentary on the declining stock of the First Amendment amongst Democratic presidential contenders; and road warrior Kevin Williamson\u2019s tribute to the SUV. Great stuff.\n\nLet\u2019s recap: Check out the issue, get NRPLUS, and if you want to do a solid for someone who would enjoy all of NR\u2019s fortnightly conservative brilliance, give NR as a gift!", "description": "With book excerpts from Rich Lowry and Rick Brookhiser, plus terrific features from Kevin Williamson and Jay Nordlinger, this is a must-read issue of NR.", "authors": ["Jack Fowler", "Ilya Shapiro", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kevin D.
