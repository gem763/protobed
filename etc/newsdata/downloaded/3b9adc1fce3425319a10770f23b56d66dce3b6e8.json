(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTHE KEY\n\nTop government cybersecurity officials are worried that ransomware, which has wreaked havoc by locking up the computer networks of businesses, schools and police stations, could be used to sow chaos during the 2020 election.\n\nPerhaps most damaging of all would be if hackers used ransomware \u2014 an attack disabling an organization's computers and encrypting its data \u2014 to lock up a state\u2019s voter registration database in the days before an election. That would prevent local election officials from verifying that people are voting where they\u2019re supposed to, Chris Krebs, the top cybersecurity official at the Homeland Security Department, said yesterday.\n\nKrebs\u2019s organization, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is launching a major initiative to ensure those databases are protected against ransomware, which was first reported by Reuters last week.\n\nThe organization is also contacting more than 8,000 election jurisdictions and urging them to take basic cybersecurity measures to ensure their other election infrastructure is as secure as possible, he said.\n\n\u201cWe're not going to let the Russians come back. We're not going to let the Chinese, we're not going to let the Iranians,\u201d Krebs said. \u201cWe're going to be ready. We're working every day on this problem set.\u201d\n\nA ransomware attack could conceivably throw the results of the 2020 presidential election into question and spark deep distrust in the results \u2014 without the attackers hacking any voting machines or changing any votes.\n\nKrebs described that as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in a speech at the Billington Cybersecurity Summit. The danger is particularly grave because voter registration databases were targeted by Russian hackers in 2016, according to the report by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, and are the piece of election infrastructure most likely to be connected to the Internet.\n\nAbout half of states have signed up for DHS to scan their voter registration databases to ensure they\u2019re as secure as possible against ransomware, Krebs told reporters on the sidelines of the cybersecurity conference. In some other cases, those states are getting the same cybersecurity scans but from private security companies, he said.\n\nHe described the initiative as part of a broader DHS effort to evolve from the 2018 election \u2014 when the department focused primarily on helping state and local election agencies achieve basic digital protections against hacking \u2014 to envisioning and protecting against what attackers might do next in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to look at, given what we know today \u2026 what\u2019s the worst-case scenario a year from now?\u201d he said. \u201cHow could things get worse? That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get ahead of.\u201d\n\nHackers that target businesses and state and local government agencies with ransomware have generally unlocked the victims' files after they paid a ransom, but there\u2019s no guarantee that attackers targeting voter registration databases would do the same \u2014 especially if their real goal was to undermine the election rather than to make money.\n\nRansomware attacks have also grown substantially in recent years as hackers see how lucrative they can be. An August report from the cybersecurity company McAfee Labs found the attacks had increased more than 100 percent over the previous year.\n\n\u201cRansomware is not a problem that's going away,\u201d Krebs said. \u201cEvery time a company, an agency or jurisdiction or whatever pays [a ransom] out, it just validates the model.\u201d\n\nDuring a separate cybersecurity conference yesterday, FBI Deputy Assistant Director Tonya Ugoretz urged ransomware victims never to pay ransoms, saying it would encourage more such attacks and could fund other nefarious activities.\n\nHere are details from CBS News\u2019s Olivia Gazis:\n\n\"We do *not* recommend paying the ransom\" in ransomware attacks, says FBI's Tonya Ugoretz - even in cases where costs of not paying begin to exceed ransom amount. Victims don't know where money goes, whether files will actually be decrypted & payouts only encourage the activity. \u2014 Olivia Gazis (@Olivia_Gazis) September 5, 2019\n\nYou are reading The Cybersecurity 202, our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news.

(Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nPINGED: Paige Thompson, the hacker who was charged in a data breach that compromised the personal information of about 106 million Capital One bank customers, has pleaded not guilty to all charges, Jeff Stone at CyberScoop reported.\n\nThompson may have also stolen data from more than 30 other companies, according to court documents, but the documents don\u2019t name those companies. Amazon Web Services, Thompson's former employer that provided cloud storage to the allegedly hacked companies, told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that it was not aware of breaches of any other customers. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).\n\nIn addition to stealing victims\u2019 data, federal prosecutors are alleging that Thompson used the hacks to harness the companies' computing power to mine for cryptocurrency. Thompson could face up to 25 years in prison on one count of computer fraud and abuse and one count of wire fraud.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nPATCHED: A coalition of 26 moderate House Democrats sent leadership in both chambers of Congress a letter yesterday urging them to take immediate action to bring election security legislation up for a vote.\n\nHouse Democrats have passed legislation requiring voting systems to use paper ballots and authorizing $600 million in election security funding to states, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has blocked the measures.\n\n\u201cIn a divided government, the only way we can accomplish this vital task is to put politics aside and pursue bipartisan solutions that can pass a Democratic-led House and a Republican-led Senate, and go to a Republican President\u2019s desk for a signature,\u201d wrote the co-chairs of the Blue Dog Coalition and its task force on national security.\n\nAlso yesterday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) listed \u201cgreater action to deter Russia and secure our elections ahead of 2020, including votes on bipartisan election security legislation and new funding in the 2020 appropriations process\u201d as one of five major priorities for this fall in a letter to colleagues.\n\nHands type on a computer keyboard. (Damian Dovarganes/AP)\n\nPWNED: After failing to negotiate down a hacking group\u2019s ransom request for more than $5 million in bitcoin in exchange for unlocking its computer systems, the city of New Bedford, Mass. reversed course and managed to restore its services on its own, StateScoop\u2019s Benjamin Freed reports.\n\nThe city initially offered hackers $400,000, a number closer to other ransoms the hacking group has collected in recent months. The Ryuk group \u2014 named for the ransomware it uses \u2014 has collected as little as $100,000 from a public school district in New York to as much as $600,000 from Riviera Beach, Fla. The original $5 million demand would have been among the highest-known hacking ransoms ever collected.\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\n\u2014 Cybersecurity news from the public sector:\n\nVoting Machine Makers Give U.S. Access in Fight Against Hackers Companies that make voting machines and election systems have given the Homeland Security Department access to engineering details and operations so the U.S. can identify potential vulnerabilities hackers might exploit heading into the 2020 election, a department official said.
