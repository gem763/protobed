Los Angeles Rams linebacker Clay Matthews and Detroit Lions cornerback Tracy Walker were also fined for criticizing officials after their Week 6 games.\n\nMayfield completed 22 of 37 passes for 249 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions in the 32-28 loss Oct. 13 in Cleveland. After the game, he told reporters the referees were \u201cpretty bad.\u201d He specifically took issue with a blindside block penalty against Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry and a non-call of a face mask committed on running back Nick Chubb.\n\n\u201cThe refs are never an excuse,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cI will probably get fined for saying this, but it was pretty bad today. The guy is squared up with [Landry], running at him and he is lowering his head into Jarvis. What is [Landry] supposed to do? Avoid him? This is not bull fighting. I don\u2019t know. It ticks me off.\u201d\n\nMayfield has completed 56.6 percent of his throws for 1,496 yards, five scores and a league-high 11 interceptions in six starts this season. The Browns have a Week 7 bye before facing the New England Patriots Oct. 27 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass.", "description": "Oct. 19 (UPI) \u2014 Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been fined $12,500 for criticizing officials after a Week 6 loss to the Seattle", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
