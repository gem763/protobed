They are looking at the United States economy because the language, culture, geography, it is super easy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the challenges. Most of the Canadian companies are still struggling at Series A or Series B. After that, the United States companies acquire the (Canadian) companies, if they have good technology.\u201d\n\nThere are currently no Canada-based firms among 82 companies in the fund\u2019s holdings, which include Uber Technologies Inc., WeWork and Slack Technologies Inc. (which had headquarters in B.C. before moving to California).\n\nThe fund was started by SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son in 2017 to focus on late-stage venture capital investments. It invests a minimum of US$100 million, and sometimes much more. In Canada, only three disclosed venture capital deals last year were worth more than $100 million according the Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association.\n\nWhen the fund launched, its single largest investor was the Saudi Arabian government. Son has boasted that he secured US$45 billion from Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in a 45-minute meeting.\n\nSome of its biggest bets, however, have not been performing well.\n\nThe fund put US$7.6 billion into Uber in 2018, and since the company IPO in May, shares have dropped nearly 30 per cent. Slack is down more than 35 per cent since going public earlier this year.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s WeWork, the office-space company that rents out co-working space in urban centres. SoftBank has poured nearly US$11 billion into the company in successive rounds of venture capital investment, raising the startup to a total valuation of US$47 billion.\n\nBut over the summer when WeWork filed paperwork for an IPO, investors got a look at the company\u2019s financials, including disclosure that then-CEO Adam Neumann bought office buildings and rented them back to the company, and that he personally trademarked the word \u201cWe\u201d and then sold it to the company when they rebranded as The We Company.\n\nWall Street guys, or investment guys, or journalist guys are looking at just two or three years' time frame. But AI is changing over three decades, or 300 years Yoshiaki Tanaka, senior director, SoftBank Telecom America Corp.\n\nAfter initially slashing its IPO price and then delaying the investor roadshow, Neumann was eventually forced out of the company he founded, and the company withdrew its plans for a public offering. But since WeWork is losing money and it needed funds from the IPO, the future of the business is still very much up in the air.\n\nA couple of times during his talk, Tanaka mentioned WeWork in passing, prompting awkward laughs from the audience. Speaking to the Financial Post, he said that ultimately people will need to take a longer view of the Vision Fund investments.\n\n\u201cHey, of course WeWork is cash-negative, Uber is still cash-negative \u2026 but they are disrupting an industry, and journalists looking at just two or three years\u2019 time frame,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWall Street guys, or investment guys, or journalist guys are looking at just two or three years\u2019 time frame. But AI is changing over three decades, or 300 years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Vision Fund is particularly controversial among competing venture capitalists, who say it\u2019s warped the whole industry, and inflated valuations by throwing so much money around.\n\n\u201cSoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund has had an impact on the global VC space, simply by its sheer size, given that the majority of VCs invest in smaller cheque sizes,\u201d said Sam Ifergan, founder of Toronto-based iGan Partners, a venture capital fund focused on health tech.\n\n\u201cThe concern is that the fund would end up raising investment valuations for early-stage companies. Unicorns whose business models are predicated on losing $1.50 for every $1 in revenue better retrench very quickly.\u201d\n\nIf people are made happy, then the regulation should follow people\u2019s demand. Yoshiaki Tanaka, senior director, SoftBank Telecom America Corp.\n\n\n\nTanaka said the Vision Fund is disrupting venture capital, and in turn, the investing strategy of Son is to look for companies that can disrupt industries by breaking regulatory structures.\n\n\u201cUber broke regulation. And AirBNB broke regulation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOpportunity is first. If people are made happy, then the regulation should follow people\u2019s demand.\u201d\n\nLooking at the world that way, one of Tanaka\u2019s suggestions to the Toronto audience was that Canadian business might do well to combine two areas of strength \u2014 artificial intelligence and health care.\n\nHe elaborated on that idea after the talk.\n\n\u201cThe key thing I\u2019m looking for is, No. 1, the total addressable market, and how to break the market compared to its incumbent players \u2014 in the health space, in the mobility space,\u201d Tanaka said.\n\n\u201cWe will announce shortly we have health-care companies. It\u2019s not necessarily fitting to the regulation, but (there is) high demand and an aging society and a lot of dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d", "description": "Persistent issue of our startups exiting on foreign buyout before giving themselves chance to grow", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/a1008_biz_jm_visionfund.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
