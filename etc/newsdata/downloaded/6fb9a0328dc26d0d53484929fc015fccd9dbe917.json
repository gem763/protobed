I never thought AI would come for my teeth.\n\nThe toothbrush connects to an app on your phone over Bluetooth. When you start brushing, the app will show a timer of how long you\u2019ve been brushing and guide you to where should brush next. That seems handy.\n\nOral-B says the toothbrush uses sensors to know when you\u2019re applying too much pressure or not brushing long enough in a certain spot, and then sends data from the sensors to the app. The app takes this sensor data and uses the \u201cGenius X AI algorithm\u201d to tell you where you need to brush better and give you a rating on how well you brushed. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d like that feature. It sounds like the toothbrush can brush-shame me.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Oral-B\u2019s first connected toothbrush. The company released a Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush in 2014, which could be \u201cprogrammed with the help of a dentist.\u201d It launched its Genius line of toothbrushes in 2016, but earlier models needed to use your smartphone\u2019s camera to follow your brushing. That meant you had to plop your phone into a smartphone mount on your bathroom mirror every time you brushed, which I would imagine would get annoying after a while.\n\nPhilips Sonicare and Kolibree have offered toothbrushes for years that seem to work similarly to the Genius X. Kolibree\u2019s even turns brushing into a game. Onvi\u2019s toothbrush will stream footage of the inside of your mouth. And they\u2019re all pretty expensive \u2014 a decently affordable option is Kolibree\u2019s, which is available at Best Buy for $149.99, though Kolibree also partnered with Colgate on an even cheaper toothbrush that\u2019s $99.95.\n\nSome people have already gotten their hands on the Genius X, and reviews seem... positive? One reviewer at Forbes praised how well the app tracked the toothbrush\u2019s position in his mouth. If you really want to go deep, the YouTube channel Electric Teeth has a 25-minute review of the toothbrush \u2014 and the reviewer really liked it.\n\nBut I still think I\u2019m going to use the toothbrush I get from the dentist every six months.", "description": "Oral-B has launched its $220 Oral-B Genius X electric toothbrush, which the company says uses AI to help you brush better.
