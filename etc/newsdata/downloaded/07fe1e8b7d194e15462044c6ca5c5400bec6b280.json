Elizabeth Monahan, a flight expert at the SeatGuru airline seat comparison site (seatguru.com), says timing is key.\n\n\u2018If you book in advance, premium economy is generally 85 per cent more expensive than the standard economy fare,\u2019 she reveals.\n\n\u2018But if you book closer to your departure date, premium economy is generally only 10 to 35 per cent more expensive, so remember to ask about premium economy if you have a last-minute economy booking.\u2019\n\nOur survey of four airlines\u2019 premium economy products on the London to New York route shows expectations do need to be managed if you\u2019re booking in this class.\n\nNone offered lounge access with a premium economy ticket. Norwegian cut back on its premium economy offering this year, removing lounge access unless you buy a much more expensive PremiumFlex ticket, and stopping free spirits on board.\n\nStandard premium economy passengers are now limited to complimentary beer and wine.\n\nAir New Zealand won airline and airport ranking consultancy firm Skytrax\u2019s Best Premium Economy Class award last year\n\nEven the size of the seat isn\u2019t a huge improvement with some airlines. BA, for example, offers seats in premium economy (which it calls World Traveller Plus) that are only an inch wider than those in coach.\n\n\u2018A premium economy fare is generally 65 per cent less expensive than a business class fare,\u2019 says Elizabeth at SeatGuru.\n\n\u2018In terms of space and amenities, these two classes are very different, with business class offering up to 50 per cent more legroom, significantly greater recline, more substantial leg rests and head rests, and superior food and wine choices.\u2019\n\nSo if premium economy isn\u2019t quite the fabled middle ground between economy and business class, which airline is the best at emphasising the \u2018premium\u2019 rather than the \u2018economy\u2019 element of your ticket?\n\nAir New Zealand won airline and airport ranking consultancy firm Skytrax\u2019s Best Premium Economy Class award last year. With complimentary drinks you can order from your seatback touchscreen, a huge 41in seat pitch, a 19in seat width and four pieces of baggage (two for the cabin and two for the hold) all included, it\u2019s perhaps the closest an airline has come to a genuine half-way house between economy and business class.\n\nIn theory, premium economy is supposed to appeal to passengers who don\u2019t mind spending a little extra for a more comfortable flight\n\n\u2018When the extra cost of premium economy is 10 to 15 per cent more than standard economy, that\u2019s the point where it represents good value for the comfort-conscious flier,\u2019 concludes Elizabeth Monahan.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s hard not to think that the number crunching you do to work out whether that complimentary pre-flight glass of fizz is worth the extra cost is taking some of the glamour out of \u2018luxury\u2019 flying.\n\nPremium economy may be a slight improvement on cattle class. But trying to figure out just how significant that upgrade really is brings playwright Noel Coward\u2019s remark to mind: \u2018I\u2019ll go through life either first class or third, but never in second.\u2019", "description": "Over the past few years, airlines around the world have come up with a choice pitched between the champagne and flat beds of business class and the pasta and plastic cups of coffee in coach.", "authors": ["Rob Crossan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/20/19899474-0-image-a-48_1571425340493.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
