NBC is facing new questions about the firing -- what they knew and when they knew as well it, as a possible potential quid-pro-quo arrangement with film producer Harvey Weinstein, who is about to come to trial for his own sexual assault case.\n\n\"Today\" brings in more than $500 million a year to the coffers of NBCUniversal and its parent Comcast. Though the headlines may be painful for the show to go through again, Schiffer, who also serves as chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, said \u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s no longer there. They addressed it at that point. Yes, it appears that there wasn\u2019t the transparency that should have happened, but I don\u2019t think that advertisers are going to bash NBC in the teeth and leave in droves over this new revelation.\u201d\n\nBrad Adgate, who was a senior vice president with ad agency Horizon Media for 17 years and is now an independent consultant agrees. \u201cHe\u2019s already gone, so the thing is, once those allegations came to light, NBC got rid of Lauer within 24 hours,\u201d said Adgate. \u201cI don\u2019t really see the advertisers doing anything, at least for now, based on what we know. NBC did the right thing, they compensated the woman who was harassed by Lauer in Sochi.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that advertisers are going to be happy...but I don\u2019t see mass exodus out of NBC because of what was perhaps a poorly managed set of circumstances.\u201d - Eric Schiffer, the CEO of Patriarch Group and Digitalmarketing.com\n\nThere are two other groups of people NBC News will have to answer to -- its staff and the audience.\n\n\u201cDoes it impact NBC\u2019s brand and will it upset employees at the network? Absolutely,\u201d said Schiffer. \u201cBut will they be able to recover with a revised effort on transparency and some tougher rules about how they handle things in the future? Yes. I think it\u2019s going to be fairly painless in the short run because they\u2019ll announce tougher internal rules for vetting these situations and, perhaps, some further transparency on why this wasn\u2019t revealed, and that will put an end to it.\u201d\n\nThe viewers will ultimately decide with the ratings. \"Today\" leads ABC's \"Good Morning America\" in the morning news race of the key audience segment of adults 25-to-54. The show has won 195 out of 197 weeks. However, \"Good Morning America\" leads in total viewers. For the week of Sept. 30 \"GMA\" led with 3.7 million versus 3.6 million for \"Today\" (\"CBS This Morning\" which has dealt with its own sexual assault charges with former anchor Charlie Rose trailed with 2.8 million).\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nWhile NBC is receiving headlines and blame in how they handled Lauer with the new allegations, Schiffer thinks the show, the news division and the network will survive this chapter.\n\n\u201cThe challenge really is one of transparency, and at the same time, where they weren\u2019t transparent, they did exit him,\u201d said Schiffer. \u201cThis is versus a lack of transparency and then a lack of removing him, and that\u2019s going to help them manage this crisis much easier.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "Read about how experts see advertisers reacting to latest Matt Lauer revelations", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/12/0/0/Matt20Lauer20220AP20FBN.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
