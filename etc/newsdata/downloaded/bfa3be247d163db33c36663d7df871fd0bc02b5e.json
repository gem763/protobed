The PM is engaging in a series of phone calls with his European counterparts in a bid to persuade them to at least entertain his blueprint.\n\nMr Johnson is expected to travel to European capitals in the coming days to make his case in person but it is unclear exactly who he will meet and when.\n\nIs the PM going to try to prorogue Parliament again?\n\nYes he is. Mr Johnson is due to ask the Queen for permission to suspend Parliament from next Tuesday.\n\nA Queen's Speech will then be held on October 14 so that the government can set out its domestic legislative agenda.\n\nHow likely is it that this prorogation will be ruled unlawful?\n\nNot very. The PM's original attempt to prorogue Parliament for five weeks was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the amount of time MPs would be away was unacceptable because it would prevent them from scrutinising the government's Brexit plans.\n\nBut the court made clear that a shorter suspension of five or six days would likely be acceptable.\n\nAssuming prorogation does go ahead - and there is no reason to think that it won't - MPs would return to work on October 14 to hear the Monarch set out Mr Johnson's domestic plans.\n\nThere would then likely follow four days of debate with votes likely to be held on October 21.\n\nWhen is the last EU summit before the Brexit deadline?\n\nWhat is Boris Johnson's five-point plan to scrap the Irish backstop? Single market Northern Ireland would leave the Customs' Union with the rest of the UK but stay in the single market. This would constitute an 'all island regulatory zone' that covers trade of all goods. It would mean no checks between the two nations, because Northern Ireland would still have to follow EU rules. Goods from Britain to Northern Ireland would effectively be managed by a border in the Irish Sea, with checks only in that direction, not the reverse. Stormont Lock The 'all island regulatory zone' will have to be approved by the people of Northern Ireland. This means the Northern Ireland Assembly has the right to veto the zone and could hold a referendum on the matter. Customs checks Customs checks would have to be put in place on trade between Northern and the Republic of Ireland. Most checks would be made using technology, but some would still have to be physical. Cash for Northern Ireland A promise of a 'new deal for Northern Ireland' means ministers putting money aside for Belfast and Dublin to help aide economic development and ensure new measures work. Keeping to the Good Friday agreement Freedom of movement between two countries will remain. New deal would confirm commitment to collobaration between UK and Ireland.\n\nIt is due to take place in Brussels on October 17-18. Both Britain and the bloc will be targeting that summit as potentially the last chance for a Brexit deal to be agreed.\n\nHowever, negotiations are rarely actually carried out when European leaders meet - all of the hard work on the nuts and bolts of the deal will have to have been done before the meeting takes place.\n\nThat means the UK and EU have just two weeks to hammer out the terms of a new agreement.\n\nIf the framework of an accord is not in place by October 17 it is unlikely that one would be agreed at the summit.\n\nHowever, there would still be scope for an emergency summit immediately before the Halloween deadline if something changed.\n\nWhat about the anti-No Deal law?\n\nThe so-called Benn Act which was passed by Parliament after rebel MPs took control of the House of Commons requires the PM to ask the EU for a Brexit delay until January next year if the two sides have not agreed a deal by October 19.\n\nThe PM has said that he will abide by whatever is on the UK's statute book but he has also vowed to stick to his 'do or die' Brexit pledge, sparking fears that he could try to ignore or get around the legislation.\n\nWhat happens if the PM breaks the law?\n\nSuch a circumstance would be unthinkable but if it happened it would trigger immediate legal action and the Supreme Court would likely rule that the law must be complied with.\n\nIf the PM refused and potentially resigned it would then probably fall to someone else to have to ask the EU for a Brexit delay.\n\nToday it emerged that EU leaders are reportedly ready to outflank Mr Johnson and approve the three month delay even if he refuses to ask for one.\n\nIt has been suggested that the letter required by the Benn Act requesting the delay might not have to be signed by Mr Johnson and that it could be done by the 'head of government or head of state' - that raises the prospect of the Queen getting involved.\n\nAn EU source told The Times: 'We don't care who it is, whether it is the prime minister or another representative of the executive.\n\nThe chances of the Queen intervening by writing the letter appear slim but it is thought the Supreme Court could ask a senior civil servant to pen the request.\n\nShould the PM refuse to comply with the law and refuse to quit, MPs could table a vote of no confidence to try to oust him.\n\nWhat happens if the two sides do agree a deal?\n\nThe terms struck would be put to a vote in the House of Commons - just like when Theresa May's deal was voted on (and defeated) three times.\n\nThe government is bullish on the prospects of Mr Johnson being able to secure a majority for what he has proposed.\n\nHe would probably be reliant on the support of a handful of Labour MPs in order to win.\n\nSo what exactly is Boris Johnson's offer to the EU on the backstop?\n\nThe PM set out in a letter to Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday how he intends to replace the backstop.\n\nThe government's view is that 'the proposed 'backstop' is a bridge to nowhere, and a new way forward must be found.'\n\nInstead the government is proposing a 'new Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland' that is 'based around five elements'.\n\nThe plan is to create two Northern Irish borders at the end of the Brexit transition period, with the arrangements rolled out in January 2021.\n\nOne of them will be a regulatory border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nEffectively this would amount to a border in the Irish Sea with Northern Ireland remaining aligned with the EU on single market rules for all goods while the rest of the UK could diverge from those rules.\n\nThat regulatory border would come with a proposed four-yearly review mechanism - but it would only go ahead in 2021 if the Northern Irish Assembly agreed to it.\n\nThe PM told Jean-Claude Juncker in a letter yesterday that he is anxious to strike a deal, adding: 'If we cannot reach one, it would represent a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible.'\n\nThe four-page letter proceeds dozens of pages of proposal that outlines the Prime Minister's new Brexit blueprint, including a solution to the Irish backstop\n\n'We are proposing that the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly should have the opportunity to endorse those arrangements before they enter into force, that is, during the transition period, and every four years afterwards,' the PM's letter to Brussels says.\n\nThe second border would be between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and it would be purely relating to customs.\n\nThe UK is effectively asking the EU to grant wide-ranging exemptions on customs rules to make the north/south border as frictionless as possible.\n\nIn simple terms, the backstop would be completely scrapped, Northern Ireland would leave the customs union with the rest of the UK but it would remain in parts of the single market until 2025.\n\nThe plan has been dubbed 'two borders for four years'.\n\nWhat would happen in 2025?\n\nThe Northern Irish Assembly would be asked how it wants to proceed, with two options on the table.\n\nThe first would be for Northern Ireland to continue to stay aligned with EU regulations.\n\nThe second would be to split from EU rules and then realign with the rest of the UK which would be assumed to have diverged from the Brussels regulations book in a number of areas by that time.\n\nIf Stormont opted for the second option it could risk the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\nBut it would be hoped that by 2025 there would be technological solutions which could avoid that eventuality.\n\n'Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory, not the EU customs union, after the end of the transition period. We must do so whole and entire. Control of trade policy is fundamental to our future vision,' the PM said in his letter to Brussels.\n\nWhat else is in the PM's plan?\n\nThe proposals to keep Northern Ireland in the single market for all goods, for the whole UK to leave the customs union at the same time and for Stormont to have a say on whether the borders plan goes ahead are the most eye-catching of the five points put forward by the PM.\n\nBut the final two are also important.\n\nFirstly, Mr Johnson makes clear in his blueprint that he wants the two sides to 'find solutions which are compatible with the Good Friday Agreement' in order to protect peace on the island of Ireland.\n\n'This framework is the fundamental basis for governance in Northern Ireland and protecting it is that highest priority for all,' the PM said in his letter to Mr Juncker.\n\nSecondly, the premier has also recommitted to UK/Irish collaboration in a bid to ensure that Brexit does not harm the current relationship between the two nations.\n\nIn terms of specifics it reaffirms the UK's commitment to maintaining the current Common Travel Area as well as continuing north/south cooperation.\n\nWhat about the customs posts plan we heard about earlier this week?\n\nIt was reported that the UK was proposing establishing 'customs clearance centres' on both sides of the border as part of its plan to replace the backstop.\n\nThose customs posts would be located between five and 10 miles away from the crossing and would see lorries carrying goods check in and check out as they head north or south.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Irish backstop and why is it so divisive? The so-called Irish border backstop is one of the most controversial parts of the existing Brexit deal. This is what it means: What is the backstop? The backstop was invented to meet promises to keep open the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland even if there is no comprehensive UK-EU trade deal. The divorce deal says it will kick in automatically at the end of the Brexit transition period if that deal is not in place. It effectively keeps the UK in a customs union with the EU and Northern Ireland in both the customs union and single market. This means many EU laws will keep being imposed on the UK, restricting its ability to do its own trade deals. It also means regulatory checks on some goods crossing the Irish Sea. Why have Ireland and the EU demanded it? Because the UK is leaving the customs union and single market, the EU said it needed guarantees that people and goods circulating inside its border - in this case in Ireland - met its rules. This is covered by the Brexit transition, which effectively maintains the status quo, and can in theory be done in the comprehensive EU-UK trade deal. But the EU said there had to be a backstop to cover what happens in any gap between the transition and final deal. Why do critics hate it? Because Britain cannot decide when to leave the backstop. Getting out - even if there is a trade deal - can only happen if both sides agree and Brexiteers fear the EU will unreasonably demand the backstop continues so EU law continues to apply in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland MPs also hate the regulatory border in the Irish Sea, insisting it unreasonably carves up the United Kingdom.\n\nSuch an approach would have ensured there was no physical infrastructure built at the border itself but it would have meant physical infrastructure being built somewhere and that would likely have been enough for the the EU and Dublin to reject the plan.\n\nHowever, the plan submitted by Mr Johnson to the EU makes no reference to 'customs clearance centres' or customs posts.\n\nIt makes clear that it wants to monitor customs in a 'decentralised' way far away from the border and with only a 'very small number' of physical checks.\n\nMost of those checks would be carried out at the point of origin of goods with electronic paperwork doing most of the heavy lifting when it comes to keeping track of what is crossing the border.\n\nMr Johnson said in his letter to Mr Juncker: 'All this must be coupled with a firm commitment by both parties never to conduct checks at the border in future.'\n\nIs the EU likely to agree to the UK's new plan?\n\nBrussels will keep its powder dry until it has carefully considered what is set out in the UK's plan.\n\nBut the early noises are not good for Number 10.\n\nIrish premier Leo Varadkar said today that Mr Johnson's Brexit plans 'fall short in a number of aspects'.\n\nHe also said the operation of two different custom zones on the island would create a 'real difficulty'.\n\nHe also risked fury as he said he believed the British people wanted to stay in the EU.\n\nHe said: 'All the polls since Prime Minister Johnson became prime minister suggest that's what the British people actually want, but their political system isn't able to give them that choice.'\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Tusk said following separate phone conversations with Mr Johnson and Mr Varadkar: 'We remain open but still unconvinced.'\n\nElsewhere, the European Parliament's Brexit Steering Group (BSG) said it has 'grave concerns' about Mr Johnson's proposals, which it said cannot be backed 'in their current form'.\n\nIs a No Deal Brexit now more or less likely?\n\nUntil the EU formally responds it is hard to say for certain but it is immediately clear that the plan has not gone down particularly well in European capitals.\n\nHowever, the EU does not want a No Deal Brexit and certainly does not want to be blamed for a chaotic split.\n\nThe question now is whether the bloc believes Mr Johnson's offer can work as a starting point for further negotiations.\n\nIf the answer is no, then the two sides will be heading for a bad break on October 31 - or another Brexit delay.\n\nDonald Tusk said the EU remained 'open' to a deal' but that he was so far 'unconvinced' by Mr Johnson's offer\n\nAre there any other obvious problems with the plan?\n\nThe Northern Irish Assembly would play a key part under Mr Johnson's plan but Stormont has been suspended since January 2017 due to a range of problems and disagreements between the different political parties.\n\nQuestions will inevitably be asked about whether such an unstable institution could be relied upon to be given such a crucial role in the Brexit process - firstly next year when it is asked whether or not to go ahead with the two borders plan and then again in 2025 when it is asked if it wants to continue with the arrangements.\n\nSome of this sounds familiar. Didn't Theresa May suggest something like this?\n\nOne plan Mrs May had looked at when she was in office was called 'Max Fac' - or 'Maximum Facilitation'.\n\nThat essentially suggested that technology could be used to reduce the need for customs checks and to ensure trade could remain as frictionless as possible.\n\n'Max Fac' was eventually put on the back burner but the concepts it is based on were enshrined in the old Withdrawal Agreement in the sense that it committed the two sides to examining potential technological 'alternative arrangements' to the backstop in the future.\n\nMr Johnson's new plan is also heavily reliant on technolog in order for it to work.\n\nRemind me: What's the problem with the backstop?\n\nThe main obstacle to a Brexit deal remains the Irish border insurance policy.\n\nThe protocol is effectively a safety net intended to guarantee there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\nUnder the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by Mrs May, if there is no long-term trade agreement in place that ensures an open border, the UK would remain closely tied to EU rules and its customs union.\n\nMr Johnson has insisted the measure has to be scrapped as being in a customs union would prevent the UK striking trade deals.\n\nMeanwhile, getting out of the backstop would require the agreement of both the EU and UK, something Number 10 views as unacceptable because it means it could last indefinitely.\n\nHow likely is it that the UK will leave the EU on October 31?\n\nThe answer to this question depends entirely on who you ask.\n\nMr Johnson is adamant that he will deliver on his 'do or die' pledge to take the UK out of the EU on October 31 with or without a deal.\n\nHe is also adamant that the proposals he is handing over to the EU represent the UK's 'final offer'.\n\nBut the so-called Benn Act requires the Prime Minister to seek a delay to Brexit if MPs have not approved a deal, or agreed to leave the EU without one, by October 19.\n\nMr Johnson has repeatedly said he will both obey the law and meet the Halloween deadline with or without a deal - but he has not been clear about how he intends to do both things.\n\nIt could all result in yet another constitutional crisis being played out in the courts.", "description": "The UK is braced for two of the most hectic weeks in the recent history of British politics as Boris Johnson races to try to strike a new Brexit deal with the EU.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/17/19261562-0-image-a-40_1570118815832.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
