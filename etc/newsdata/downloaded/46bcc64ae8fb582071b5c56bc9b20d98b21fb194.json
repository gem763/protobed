Sanity at last\u2019.\n\nThe next wannabe seeking her place in social media\u2019s hall of fame by pressing charges of sexual assault, especially against a national treasure like Gazza after a friendly kiss, would surely think again.\n\nFormer England football hero Paul Gascoigne was cleared by a jury of sexually assaulting a woman on a train after \u2018innocently\u2019 kissing her to make her feel better. Pictured leaving Teesside Crown Court\n\nThen, reading the court papers, I thought again. Gazza said he kissed the woman, who can\u2019t be named, to boost her confidence after a passenger called her fat and ugly.\n\nShe claimed he was steaming drunk and drooling, that he tried to sit on her, then grabbed her by the cheeks and kissed her \u2018forcefully and sloppily\u2019 for two to three seconds on the lips in full public view, though he had never met her.\n\nEven if we take his word for it that he wasn\u2019t drunk \u2014 he explained that he was slurring and dribbling only because he didn\u2019t have his dentures in \u2014 the kiss was an outrageous invasion of the poor woman\u2019s privacy. And utterly disgusting.\n\nAs for his defence that he kissed people all the time through sheer exuberance, why should that make her feel any better?\n\nHis lawyers were bent on proving his kiss had no sexual intent. So what? She was publicly humiliated.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I go along with the howls from feminists who claim the verdict was a \u2018green light for gropers\u2019. And with rape case convictions down by 26 per cent in the past year, our courts clearly have more pressing issues of sexual abuse to deal with.\n\nBut I am sickened by those pictures of a gleeful Gazza leaving court, arms artfully draped around his attractive female manager as if he could never upset any woman. This is a man whose ex-wife Sheryl complained of years of mental and physical abuse and claimed he once headbutted her.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t help feeling that the poor woman who complained about his hideous attention on the train has been short-changed of justice.\n\nWhat a woeful specimen Gazza is.\n\nFarewell to an everyday hero\n\nHow overwhelming for PC Andrew Harper\u2019s widow Lissie when more than 800 people attended his memorial service at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. He was killed responding to the burglary of a quad bike.\n\nMrs Harper recalled their last trip together to their favourite place in Cornwall, eating fish and chips on the beach.\n\nIt was a reminder, should we ever need one, of the selfless risks men like her own \u2018fierce and loving protector Andrew\u2019 run for us all, every day.\n\nHomework before catwalks\n\nExplaining her decision to take her eight-year-old daughter Sophia to do her first fashion shoot with mum, the model Abbey Clancy says: \u2018You\u2019ve got to do what you love. If she wants to be a vet . . . doctor . . . I just want her to be happy.\u2019\n\nNot much chance of a career as a doctor if she\u2019s taken away from her studies for shoots and having her head turned by ideas of life as a model.\n\nAbbey Clancy and daughter Sophia Ruby Crouch on ITV's Lorraine explaining her decision to take her eight-year-old to do her first fashion shoot with her\n\nFormula 1 ace Lewis Hamilton, whose car does six miles to the gallon, implores us all to give up meat to save the planet. \u2018Extinction of our race is becoming more and more likely as we overuse our resources,\u2019 he says. OK. I\u2019ll give up steaks when he fuels his 200mph Mercedes on carrot and kale juice.\n\nThe Duchess of York was presented with two double-decker cakes at a charity event that coincided with her 60th birthday. A bit pointed, given Fergie\u2019s struggle with her sweet tooth. Or did they think they\u2019d need one cake for her and one for the other guests?\n\nStrictly supremo Shirley Ballas has had death threats after agreeing with fellow judges to vote off a celebrity we\u2019ve never heard of \u2014 Radio 1 DJ Dev Griffin \u2014 last week.\n\nWhen will viewers realise that now the show can\u2019t attract any celebs, the real stars are the dancers: AJ, Amy, Anton, Gorka.\n\nAnd never would they have booted out their prize asset Aljaz Skorjanec, the finest example of manhood ever to come out of Slovenia, even if his partner Emma Weymouth was less graceful than a one-legged duck out of water.\n\nStop whining and be like Wills, Harry\n\nIn an ITV documentary tomorrow night, Prince Harry reveals the \u2018pain\u2019 he endures conducting his royal duties. Walking in his mother Diana\u2019s footsteps in Africa was like reopening \u2018a wound that festers\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018Being part of this family, in this role . . . every time I see a camera . . . it takes me straight back, so it\u2019s the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best.\u2019\n\nWhile we all sympathise over his loss, compassion for Harry is fast fading because of his whining.\n\nPrince William and Kate, by contrast, after visiting a children\u2019s cancer hospital in Pakistan that Diana helped to fund, then a mosque, were told by honorary consul Fakir Aijazuddin: \u2018If there\u2019s one word to describe your visit it is \u201cjoy\u201d. You have radiated joy wherever you have been.\u2019 A lesson, perhaps, for his little brother.\n\nFormer One Direction heart-throb Harry Styles, once tipped as the next Mick Jagger but now with his star fading into a black hole, has cryogenically frozen his entire wardrobe. Did he mistakenly put his career in the deep-freeze too?\n\nFormer One Direction star Harry Styles arriving for the 2019 Met Gala, who has cryogenically frozen his entire wardrobe\n\nFriends Reunited\n\nJennifer Aniston apologised for \u2018breaking\u2019 Instagram when she launched her first account with a picture of her and the other actors from Friends.\n\nIn doing so she became the fastest person to reach a million followers, in five hours, 16 minutes.\n\nAll Rachel\u2019s original Friends were in the picture \u2014 Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey and Ross \u2014 which says something rather marvellous about megastar Jennifer and her capacity for enduring . . . friendship.\n\nFriends reunited! Jennifer Aniston (centre) brings together all five of her co-stars from the hit show. She posed alongside Courteney Cox (far left), Lisa Kudrow (left), Matt LeBlanc (middle back), Matthew Perry (right) and David Schwimmer (far right)\n\nNot for the first time, Royal Mail workers are threatening to strike in the run-up to Christmas, handing over their most profitable period to cheaper services and forcing us reluctantly to send Yuletide greetings by email. For those of us who still love sending and receiving Christmas cards, it\u2019s like Santa\u2019s reindeer going on strike.\n\nWestminster Wars...\n\nAs the dust settles after Boris\u2019s Braveheart moment and he revels in the backslapping from EU leaders, spare a thought for the two women on whose shoulders he climbed to get there \u2014 Theresa May and his wife Marina.\n\nOdd that priority was given in the PM\u2019s negotiations to removing VAT on tampons, to fulfil a referendum vow. I\u2019d rather Boris had kept his oft-repeated promise to stop the hounding of our Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan military veterans.\n\nBoris compared his Brexit negotiations to The Shawshank Redemption, in which the hero swims through sewers to escape from prison. Let\u2019s hope he wasn\u2019t also seeing himself as Steve McQueen in The Great Escape \u2014 who was foiled just when he\u2019d almost reached freedom.\n\nStanding in the way of Boris\u2019s deal are DUP leader Arlene Foster, the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon, Lib Dem Jo Swinson, Change UK\u2019s Anna Soubry and the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas. He always did have a problem with women.", "description": "AMANDA PLATELL: England football hero Paul Gascoigne was cleared by a jury of sexually assaulting a woman on a train after 'innocently' kissing her to make her feel better.", "authors": ["Amanda Platell For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/00/19907452-0-image-a-45_1571442296147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
