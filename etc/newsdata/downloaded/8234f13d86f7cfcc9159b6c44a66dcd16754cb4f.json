I suspect Green has over-interpreted the meeting. There are many cards left to play in the game before we get to a manifesto.\u201d\n\nJohnson has repeatedly insisted he will take the U.K. out of the EU deal or no deal on October 31, but a cross-party coalition of MPs passed a law last month blocking a no-deal departure from the bloc.\n\nThe prime minister then tried to call a general election, but MPs have refused to back the bid until the current Brexit deadline has been delayed.", "description": "A senior UK government official said no manifesto position has yet been agreed.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174515728-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
