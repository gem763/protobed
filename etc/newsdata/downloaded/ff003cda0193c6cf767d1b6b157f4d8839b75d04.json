An hour before its start, a crowd of several hundred demonstrators was growing.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe $50K nothing burger,\u201d one protest sign read, with \u201cWhopper Junior\u201d written on its back side.\n\nThe event announcement had touted Trump as \u201can innovator and leader in today\u2019s young business world\u201d and Guilfoyle as a \u201csought after national speaker.\u201d Guilfoyle is an attorney and former Fox News host.\n\nAD\n\nDespite the pair\u2019s high profile in the Trump campaign, the students responsible for bringing them to campus said the visit was not about politics. \u201cThis event is a campus speaking engagement, not a campaign event,\u201d said Henry Fair, who is in charge of the \u00adACCENT Speakers Bureau.\n\nTickets to the 843-seat auditorium where Trump and Guilfoyle were to speak were distributed without charge to students and claimed within hours.\n\nAD\n\nBobby Mermer, co-president of Graduate Assistants United at UF, said many students felt they were being forced to support the couple\u2019s appearance. \u201cThese are well-known campaign surrogates traveling the country for a political candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nMermer said he wouldn\u2019t object if Trump and Guilfoyle spoke on campus without payment, as candidates have in the past. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Democratic presidential contender, addressed an outdoor campaign rally on the campus in 2016 that was attended by 8,000. He was not paid.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe would be opposed to the ACCENT bureau using student fees to fund any candidates \u2014 Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Mermer said. \u201cHave the campaigns or private funds pay for it, not mandatory student fees.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn an email, Fair noted that ACCENT had made a similar speech request of Sanders\u2019s campaign. \u201cUnfortunately, Senator Sanders declined.\u201d\n\nThe speakers bureau is part of the university\u2019s Student Government Association, which independently oversees a budget of more than $21 million. The money comes from a fee of $19.06 per hour course credit that students are required to pay. The university has an enrollment of 52,000.\n\nTwo years ago, white supremacist Richard Spencer spoke on the university\u2019s campus \u2014 though not as an invited ACCESS speaker. He had first been denied access to campus by the administration and threatened to sue.\n\nAD\n\nSpencer was not paid for his speech, but security around the event cost the university more than $500,000.\n\nAD\n\nTrump and Guilfoyle spoke at Penn State this year, but that was part of the Campus Clash tour run by the conservative group Turning Point USA.\n\nNancy Thomas, director of the Institute for Democracy and Higher Education at Tufts University, said it\u2019s no surprise the Trump campaign is hitting campuses.\n\n\u201cCollege-age students were really jazzed up for the 2018 election,\u201d Thomas said, and in the midterm elections, voter turnout in that age group rose 21 percent. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see an even bigger jump . . . in the presidential election. The momentum is very strong.\u201d\n\nACCENT has brought hundreds of speakers to campus since the 1970s, usually without much controversy. Last year\u2019s October speaker, rapper Pitbull, was paid $130,000. Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman was paid $56,000 the following month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStudent government president Michael Murphy, who approved allocating funds for the Trump speech, is the son of Republican lobbyist Dan Murphy. The elder Murphy works for the Washington firm BGR Group and has donated to President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nMichael Murphy posted photos of himself at Trump\u2019s inauguration, and the White House invited him to attend a Rose Garden ceremony in March when the president signed an executive order dealing with free speech on campus.\n\nStudents opposed to Thursday\u2019s speech say hosting Trump and Guilfoyle was part of a larger effort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty detailed strategy to pick the bluest area in North Florida and bring him here,\u201d said Emily Hyden, a 20-year-old junior majoring in international studies. \u201cThey knew it would get a lot of attention.\u201d\n\nHyden and a group of student activists started a #ChompTrump movement after the event was announced.\n\n\u201cPolitical interests are clearly being valued above students,\u201d Hyden said. \u201cThis is all about pleasing the donors.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The president\u2019s son and Kimberly Guilfoyle, his girlfriend and a campaign senior adviser, were invited to give a \u201ckeynote presentation\u201d by a University of Florida student organization.", "authors": ["Lori Rozsa"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VRf_Pau88oBoFUPlVxWWbSG8jeQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MB6CMITWSII6TN5OHEG6IJMWME.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
