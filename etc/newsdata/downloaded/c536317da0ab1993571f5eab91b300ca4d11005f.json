He is only the second person to have led the side and been in this office and the first in 65 years.

Because we saw exactly that level of selflessness when he was leading Team India. Time and again Ganguly put the team before himself which prove in hindsight that he will do what is best for Indian cricket as BCCI boss. When he was skipper, he took risks, made bold choices and they paid off. That is why he was the best leader we had. He formed the base on which MS Dhoni was able to build the side. So ler's take a look at when he put the team before self:\n\n1. Getting MS Dhoni into the team\n\nGanguly had never seen Dhoni play but he backed himself because he trusted the Talent Research Development Officers - Raju Mukherjee and Prakash Poddar, who had told him of Dhoni's batting. In late 2004, Dhoni found a place in the side and of course became one of her best keepers, finishers and skippers.\n\nDon't Miss 375 SHARES 506 SHARES 195 SHARES 3.8 K SHARES\n\n2. Promoting Dhoni to No. 3\n\nIn early 2005, Ganguly decided to send Dhoni up the order. The reason was simple, he wanted Dhoni to have the best of the fielding restrctions, even if it meant demoting himself down the order. It worked wonders as Dhoni slammed a brilliant 148 vs Pakistan in only his 5th ODI. It was the first spark in the fire that would light up Indian cricket for the next decade.\n\n3. Pushing up VVS Laxman to No. 3\n\nIn the 2nd Test vs Australia in Kolkata in 2001, India had been asked to follow-on. Laxman had played a brilliant knock of 59 among the ruins and Ganguly swapped him with Rahul Dravid. Laxman came in at 3 instead of 6 while Dravid was slated to come in at 4 down. And the rest as they say is history. Laxman made 281, put on 376 runs for the 5th wicket with Dravid (180) and India won by an innings and 171 runs to end Australia's Test-winning streak.\n\n4. Sacrificing the opening slot for Sachin Tendulkar\n\nJust before the 2003 World Cup, Sachin was batting at No. 4 while Ganguly was opening with Virender Sehwag. But Ganguly realised that Sachin would be most effective if he was sent up the order but at the same time Sehwag needed to stay. Sacrificing his own place, he dropped to No. 3 and sent the Master Blaster up for the World Cup. The result - 673 runs at an average of over 60 and India made it to the final.\n\n5. Took over captaincy in a time of crisis\n\nWhen Ganguly took charge, the ugly shadow of match-fixing was on Indian cricket. Dada took the team out of troubled waters and created a unit where players were fearless. By 2002, we were the best line-up in the world. By 2003 this side could beat the best in the world. When Ganguly's stint ended, India had started to win abroad. All this because he kept calm when he was handed the reins during a crisis.", "description": "On October 23, Sourav Ganguly took charge as the 39th president of the BCCI.
