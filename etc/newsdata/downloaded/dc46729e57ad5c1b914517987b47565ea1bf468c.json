Its lush vegetation absorbs heat-trapping carbon dioxide and the moisture given off by its trees affects rainfall patterns and climate across South America and beyond.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

by Brazil\u2019s financially strapped government. But critics note that he has also complained that environmental regulations hinder development in the Amazon.\n\nIbama staffers say the regional offices are critical to their jobs, giving them closer knowledge of problem areas and faster response times in the country\u2019s most extensive state, which is larger than Texas, California and Montana combined.\n\nBolsonaro told reporters he would attend the upcoming UN General Assembly in September to deliver a speech expected to focus on the Amazon, which he says was \u201cignored\u201d by previous administrations.\n\nHis administration argues that the lack of economic opportunities and cumbersome red tape in the Amazon region contributes to rampant illegal deforestation. It says the region can be protected while allowing far more development than conservationists believe is safe.\n\nBolsonaro has sent troops to aid in fighting the blazes and banned fires to clear land in the Amazon for 60 days.\n\nBut the president has fiercely resisted efforts to treat the Amazon as a global issue, notably clashing with French President Emmanuel Macron, who told his Brazilian counterpart during the peak of the fires: \u201cWe cannot allow you to destroy everything.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro has also accused non-governmental groups of inefficiency and trying to stifle Brazil\u2019s economy by preventing development in the region.\n\nThe president also is no fan of Ibama and its enforcement actions, complaining that an \u201cindustry of fines\u201d has slowed economic development in Latin America\u2019s largest nation.\n\n\u201cI will no longer allow Ibama to distribute fines right, left and centre,\u201d Bolsonaro said before taking office. There is a personal edge to the issue: He was fined by the agency years ago for fishing in a protected area.\n\nBolsonaro and Environment Minister Ricardo Salles have also talked of ending Ibama\u2019s legal authority to burn heavy equipment being used by illegal loggers.\n\nCritics say the top-level scepticism and budget cuts are having an impact in the field. On-the-ground operations carried out by Ibama agents from January through April declined 58 per cent from the same period last year, according to official data obtained by the Brazilian group Climate Observatory. The decline began under the previous government in 2018, when operations were down 23 per cent but accelerated this year.\n\nProsecutors in the northeastern state of Para, which borders Amazonas, are investigating the link between the decline in Ibama\u2019s activities and the rise in fires this year, which have broken out at a pace not seen since 2010.\n\nFederal prosecutor Ricardo Negrini said authorities failed to act when his office warned of reports that farmers in Para had called for \u201ca day of fire\u201d to ignite multiple blazes 10 August.\n\nIbama told prosecutors it wasn\u2019t able to intervene because police forces in the state had been refusing to offer security. Ibama agents have sometimes been met with gunfire when confronting illegal loggers and miners.\n\nNegrini said he found that state police had declined to escort Ibama agents for months despite a longstanding tradition of cooperation between the two bodies. Documents seen by AP show that police forces denied six requests from Ibama in June and July.\n\nIn the documents, police say the lack of an official cooperation agreement prevented them from joining such operations, though Negrini said that had not been an issue in the past.\n\nIbama and the environment ministry did not reply to several requests for comments from The Associated Press. The Independent has also requested comment.\n\nBut in the past months, hundreds of workers from Ibama and another public agency, the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, have signed letters denouncing what they contend is government neglect of the environment.\n\nTen employees of environmental agencies interviewed by AP complained of a growing sense of censorship, intimidation and retaliations from superiors.\n\n\u201cThis is not a problem of difficult transition (from one administration to the other), because people are trying to understand how to do their jobs,\u201d said Andre Barbosa, president of an association of federal environmental employees in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThis is a project to break the system down, so that people no longer have the capacity to work.\u201d\n\nIn response to such complaints from public workers, federal prosecutors issued a statement this month asking government officials to strengthen environmental protection and to refrain from encouraging law-breaking or delegitimizing the work of Ibama agents.\n\nThey also gave officials 30 days to present information that proves they had used \u201ctechnical criteria\u201d to appoint new supervisors, many of whom have a military background.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP", "description": "The Brazilian government has begun legal procedures to remove environment protection employees who work on the ground to defend the Amazon rainforest from deforestation, land grabbing and illegal fires, official documents have revealed.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/30/15/brazil-fire-smoke.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
