The council\u2019s Black Caucus previously tried to hold up the vote over concerns that Black residents aren\u2019t represented among the owners of nearly a dozen existing medical marijuana dispensaries who would get a head start in the city when recreational sales begin Jan. 1.\n\nEleven existing businesses will be allowed to use their current location to sell recreational marijuana in the first year of legalization, according to a plan by the Chicago Department of Planning and Development. These same businesses will also be allowed to exclusively open a second recreational site until late spring of 2020, when other new businesses get a chance to bid. All of the selected business owners are white, according to Alderman Jason Ervin, chairman of the 20-member Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus.\n\n\u201cOf these 11 businesses \u2026 there is zero Black ownership. Let me repeat this: zero Black ownership of the existing lottery,\u201d Ervin said at a news conference before the council meeting, criticizing the current plan. \u201cSocial equity means \u2026 ownership. People who look like the folks standing up here having an opportunity for ownership. Not participating as workers.\u201d\n\nErvin introduced an ordinance Wednesday that would delay the start of recreational sales in Chicago to July 1 so that the council can find more equitable options that boost minority ownership. That proposal was referred to committee.\n\nCHICAGO CITY COUNCIL: Mayor Lightfoot joins aldermen for a meeting of City Council. #ChiCityCouncil https://t.co/RN77SinsbS \u2014 Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) October 16, 2019\n\nAlderman Anthony Beale, a Black Caucus member who has been a vocal critic of Lightfoot, said Wednesday he would vote against the mayor\u2019s zoning rules to influence city officials to correct mistakes in the state law.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the fact that the Black and brown community has been adversely affected by the cannabis industry \u2015 jails have been filled up, people have been locked up \u2015 and now we are being locked out of benefiting from this particular ordinance,\u201d Beale said.\n\n\u201cHow do we start a game already down 22-0? That is a travesty,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have an opportunity to make sure our community can get a piece of the pie. I guarantee you \u2026 when these licenses are rolled out, and the first 22 are people not of color, they\u2019re going to have a 12-month head start before we even start trying to level the playing field. How do we do that?\u201d\n\nAlderman David Moore, also a member of the Black Caucus, agreed with Beale, saying that zoning regulation \u201cis our only leverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis thing only comes once in a lifetime where we can gain some ground finally,\u201d Moore said, recalling memories of friends getting arrested for small amounts of marijuana while growing up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to look at when you look at the lottery piece. They say that\u2019s equal, but it\u2019s not equitable. You put 44 white balls in and one black ball and what\u2019s the probability that a black ball will get chosen?\u201d he continued. \u201cThere is no equity. The zoning is right, but there is no equity.\u201d\n\nErvin still supported voting in favor of the zoning regulations Wednesday, urging his fellow members of the Black Caucus to prioritize zoning and focus on the issue of equity at a later date.\n\n\u201cI agree with you that there are issues of equity in this conversation, there is no question, there is no doubt I stand 100% on it,\u201d Ervin said. \u201cBut what I do not want to see is these places opening at portions of our community or anywhere in the city that the local community, the aldermen and the city of Chicago do not want them to be. \u2026 We will deal with the issue of equity.\u201d\n\nBeale and Moore continued to be two of the 10 council members who voted no on the ordinance.\n\nA spokesperson for the Black Caucus did not immediately answer questions from HuffPost about voting in favor of the zoning regulations despite the lack of minority ownership, as well as what the caucus thinks is the likelihood that the measure introduced Wednesday will pass.\n\nJose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune via Getty Images Mayor Lori Lightfoot has been criticized over the zoning regulations connected to new recreational marijuana law.\n\ns\n\nLightfoot, who was at the council meeting, stressed that concerns about giving Black business owners a fair chance at recreational sales should be taken up with the state, not the city. The mayor said Chicago has very limited movement under Illinois\u2019 recreational marijuana law when it comes to sales and that the main channel the city can control is through zoning rules. Lightfoot\u2019s zoning plan splits the city into seven zones and excludes part of the downtown Loop area.\n\n\u201cI will be your partner in joining and addressing equity issues where they can be addressed, which is in Springfield,\u201d she told the council Wednesday, referring to the state capital. Lightfoot has been under pressure to avoid a delay so that the city could get the much-needed revenue from marijuana sales to help fix Chicago\u2019s debt.\n\nThe Black Caucus said it is willing to work with Lightfoot and state lawmakers to amend the law in favor of social equity and boosting minority-owned businesses, according to CBS Chicago.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we want to see people that look like us in this business profit from it,\u201d Ervin said.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker (D) signed a bill in June legalizing the possession and sale of recreational marijuana, making Illinois the first state to pass a measure on comprehensive legal pot sales through its legislature rather than as a ballot initiative. The state legalized medical marijuana in 2014.\n\nThe law was marketed as equity-focused, with a social equity program meant to help small minority-owned businesses enter the industry through grants and loans, as well as a program that puts a portion of the industry\u2019s revenue back into communities that were disproportionately affected by the drug war. The law also includes expunging marijuana convictions for up to 770,000 cases.", "description": "The City Council passed zoning regulations for recreational marijuana sales, but the Black Caucus is concerned about minority-owned business inclusion.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da8ee442000001f1250606c.jpeg?cache=7b2woe3u86&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
