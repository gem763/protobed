Discussions continue. Needs to be a sensible deal which unionists and nationalists can support. https://t.co/CpugVBfyBZ \u2014 Arlene Foster (@DUPleader) October 16, 2019\n\nI\u2019d say that till any deal is done and dusted there\u2019s almost no point in discussing the latest Brexit shenanigans, let alone in attempting to make any predictions of what will happen next.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the Remainer Establishment \u2014 that liberal elite which is determined to kill Brexit at whatever cost \u2014 is making up the rules as it goes along.\n\nWhen, for example, Boris Johnson thought he\u2019d be able to get Brexit through by proroguing parliament \u2014 a perfectly legitimate measure which has been used plenty of times before by Prime Ministers in a similar bind, including one of Johnson\u2019s most aggressive critics John Major \u2014 the Supreme Court simply declared it unlawful.\n\nHow was the Supreme Court able to do this while providing next to zero precedent for justifying this decision?\n\nBecause, being the Supreme Court, it can. It has arrogated for itself the same powers that, say, Kim Jong-Un has in North Korea or Xi Jinping has in China or Emmerson \u2018the Crocodile\u2019 Mnangagwa has in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis can be summed up as: \u201cWhatever we say goes and there\u2019s not a fat lot you peasants can do to stop us because we are the law.\u201d\n\nDitto, the Speaker of the House, John Bercow. Bercow has simply ripped up the parliamentary rule book, referring to parliamentary precedent when it suits him, ignoring it when he doesn\u2019t, wrested all power from the government and handed over control of parliament to anyone and everyone who supports Remain.\n\nThen, of course, you\u2019ve got the EU itself which has no intention whatsoever of allowing Britain to secure a meaningful Brexit.\n\nYou also have the ghost of Remaindom past in the form of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act engineered by Remainer Nick Clegg and Remainer David Cameron.\n\nThis Act is what is making it impossible for Boris Johnson to call the General Election Britain so badly needs to deliver on the people\u2019s wishes.\n\nGiven all this, I\u2019m slightly puzzled by the comments I read here and elsewhere from angry Brexiteers stamping their feet and saying how disgusted they are with Boris\u2019s negotiations and how convinced they are that Boris is going to betray Brexit.\n\nDo any of the people saying this stuff have any idea what a bind the government is in right now?\n\nIt\u2019s not the government\u2019s fault that the Fixed Term Parliaments Act exists, that the EU negotiators are hostile and unhelpful, that Theresa May spent three years essentially negotiating for Remain, that Bercow is a wrong \u2018un, that thanks largely to Tony Blair Britain now has a left-liberal judiciary fiercely biased towards Remain and with unprecedented powers thanks to the Supreme Kangaroo Court.\n\nAnd it gets worse, much worse. Here\u2019s what the Remainer Establishment in cahoots with the EU has got planned: it wants to negotiate a delay in Brexit till the middle of next summer in order to allow enough time for Britain to hold a Second Referendum whose questions will be so rigged in favour of Remain or Brexit in Name Only that we might as well not have bothered having a referendum in the first place. It\u2019s not even certain that Leave will win this time because Leave voters, especially in working-class constituencies, will already have lost faith in the democratic process and won\u2019t see the point in voting again.\n\nThis is why Boris is trying to get a deal, any deal, through because it\u2019s better than the alternative, which is no Brexit at all.\n\nIs this a happy state of affairs?\n\nNo.\n\nDoes it make one\u2019s piss boil at the vile skullduggery of our cheaty, slimy, antidemocratic, liberal-left, corrupt, mendacious, bullying, scum-sucking Establishment?\n\nOf course.\n\nBut next time you feel like ranting about the betrayal of Brexit, at least direct your righteous fury towards the right targets.\n\nWe have all been victims of an Establishment coup. A narrow, arrogant elite \u2013 unrepresentative of the country they are supposed to serve, utterly contemptuous of British traditions, of fair play or indeed of democracy itself \u2013 has grabbed control of the reins of power and there\u2019s not a damn thing any of us can do to stop them.\n\nNot legally, at any rate. Because these bastards are the ones making all the rules.", "description": "Till any deal is done and dusted there's almost no point in discussing the latest Brexit shenanigans, let alone in attempting to make any predictions of what will happen next.", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1175861063-e1571237149815-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
