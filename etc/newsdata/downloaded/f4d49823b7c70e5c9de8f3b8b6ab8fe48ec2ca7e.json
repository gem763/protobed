To make a point, one in 13 made a habit of ensuring their neighbours could see how much recycling they put out themselves on bin day.\n\nThe research also found 80 per cent of adults take pleasure in recycling while 70 per cent have tried to be more energy efficient over the past two years.\n\nA third of adults said they have considered or are considering cutting back on beef and dairy consumption.
