The Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, the People's Daily, denounced the technology company for approving an app that it says \"helps rioters\".\n\nThe paper did not name the application but the developer for HKmap.live tweeted last week that its app had been listed on the app store, stating that Apple had \"finally made the right decision\".\n\nThe app went live on October 5, its developer wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn an English language commentary piece posted on Wednesday, the Chinese newspaper accused Apple of \"mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts\", calling the move a \"reckless decision\".\n\nThe Hong Kong app crowdsources information about police movements and is used by protesters during what have sometimes become violent confrontations.\n\nThe developer posted on Twitter that Apple initially rejected the application stating that the app contains content that allows users to \"evade law enforcement\". The developer estimated that around 100,000 people used the application.\n\nEuronews reached out to Apple for comment.\n\nApple is the latest of several foreign companies to face criticism over the protests in Hong Kong which have been going on for months.\n\nChinese state media accused the US National Basketball Association (NBA) of endorsing violence on Wednesday after the Houston Rockets manager backed Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests in a tweet over the weekend.\n\nA Chinese service provider said they would stop broadcasting NBA games, and the Shanghai Sports Federation cancelled an NBA fan event on Wednesday after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he supported the manager's right to freedom of expression.\n\nThe league was heavily criticised in the US for an earlier statement released by US national media that apologised for the tweet, recognising that it had \"offended\" the NBA's \"friends and fans\" in China.\n\nOther US businesses have changed their products and advertising for association with the protest movement.\n\nLuxury jeweller Tiffany & Co removed a Twitter advert that showed a woman covering one eye, a pose that people thought referred to protesters. The company's spokesman said that the photograph was not intended to be a political statement and had been taken in May before the protests.\n\nUS sports brand Vans also removed shoe designs that reportedly referred to the Hong Kong protests after inviting the public to vote on new designs last week.\n\n\"As a brand that is open to everyone, we have never taken a political position and therefore review designs to ensure they are in line with our company\u2019s long-held values of respect and tolerance, as well as with our clearly communicated guidelines for this competition,\" the company wrote on their Vans Hong Kong Facebook page.\n\nWatch Euronews' The Cube report on the NBA in the video player above.", "description": "The Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper lashed out at Apple over a Hong Kong police tracking app.", "authors": ["Lauren Chadwick"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/84/02/1000x563_cmsv2_6b6abb1f-07df-53b7-af62-6e8ae0c6c902-4218402.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
