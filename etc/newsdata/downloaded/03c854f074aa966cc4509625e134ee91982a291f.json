REUTERS/Omar Sobhani\n\nThe militant Islamic group in 2001 destroyed artifacts dating from the third century when many Afghans practised Buddhism, including two towering Buddha statues in Bamyan province and scores of smaller ones excavated from monasteries and preserved at the national museum in Kabul.\n\nAfter the Taliban government fell that same year, the museum began restoring remnants of the country\u2019s Buddhist history. The latest U.S.-supported project aims to reassemble thousands of pieces into statues within the next three years.\n\n\u201cIt is very important (work) because it is actually restoration of our heritage, our identity, our past,\u201d said Mohammad Fahim Rahimi, director of the 100-year-old National Museum of Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cBuddhism was practised here for more than 1,000 years. That\u2019s a very large part of our history,\u201d he added.\n\nForty years of war, from the 1980s Soviet occupation to internal fighting and the war against the Taliban, have destroyed much of Afghanistan\u2019s art, artifacts and architecture.\n\nWarlords stole other pieces and sold them abroad.\n\nConservator Sherazuddin Saifi, 62, was working in the museum under the Taliban in 2001.\n\n\u201cThey wanted us to tell them the number of antiquities and we ignored their request, but some days later they came and started breaking the antiquities,\u201d said Saifi, who still works at the museum.\n\n\u201cThese antiquities are the national treasure and the history of our country and show who lived in this country,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a classroom at the museum, Afghan conservators work alongside experts from the University of Chicago\u2019s Oriental Institute. U.S. assistance is invaluable because Afghan conservators lack experience and the necessary chemicals and glues for restoration work, Rahimi said.\n\nSometimes they can work from archived photos that show the statues intact. In other cases, 3-D imaging and imagination are required to sort and reassemble stucco shards of Buddha faces, hands and torsos.\n\nA spokesman for the Taliban, which was until last month in peace talks with the United States, said the group has no plans to destroy antiquities.\n\n\u201cAll antique artifacts will be preserved in their place,\u201d spokesman Suhail Shaheen told Reuters. \u201cThey should be preserved for the history and culture education of the upcoming generations.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told a rally on Thursday American soldiers have been in Afghanistan long enough, but talks with the Taliban on withdrawing U.S. troops, intended as a step toward peace, broke down in September.\n\nThe prospect of reintegrating the Taliban in a power-sharing deal troubles Rahimi, who is looking at options for moving the artifacts if they are threatened again.\n\n\u201cWe cannot let that happen again to our heritage,\u201d he said.", "description": "Restoring Afghanistan's Buddhist artifacts that were destroyed by the Taliban 18 years ago is like working on a 1,500-year-old jigsaw puzzle, say conservators working on the latest restoration project.", "authors": ["Rod Nickel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440672995&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0R0", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
