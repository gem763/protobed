I convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d\n\nWarren responded by ignoring Biden\u2019s role entirely. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama,\u201d she said, speaking slowly and deliberately, \u201cwho fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did a hell of a job in your job,\u201d Biden shot back.\n\nWarren went on to point out that Obama \u201csometimes had to fight against people in his own administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me,\u201d his former vice president interjected.\n\nDemocratic primary voters probably don\u2019t care much who deserves more credit for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But the exchange between Biden and Warren wasn\u2019t a scrape over ideology so much as it underscored the difference between the two rivals over their approach to governing.\n\nFor Biden, the test of success is measured in votes won, colleagues persuaded, deals struck. Warren sees victory in the broader fight for support, in the groundswell among the grassroots that causes legislators to act, and to act boldly. \u201cUnderstand this: It was dream big, fight hard,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople told me, \u2018Go for something little. Go for something small.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe implication was that while Biden champions compromise, the creation of the consumer agency was an example of the \u201cstructural change\u201d around which Warren has centered her campaign. As the newly anointed front-runner in the race, it seems more and more Democratic voters are embracing Warren\u2019s vision.\n\nBut as Biden and Warren separate themselves from the primary field, their debate over the right kind of experience and the size and scope of the party\u2019s ambition is likely just beginning.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
