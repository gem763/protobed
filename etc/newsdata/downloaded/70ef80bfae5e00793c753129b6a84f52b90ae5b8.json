I blame this film for my constant longing for a near-identical twin as well as the Olsen twins\u2019 dominion over my childhood.\n\nThe premise for the movie \u2014 if you never saw the original 1961 Parent Trap, didn\u2019t come of age during the late \u201990s, or were just more of a Hilary Duff stan \u2014 is this: Hallie (played by Linsday Lohan) goes to summer camp, where she meets Annie (played by Lindsay Lohan with a British accent). The identical strangers hate each other at first, as identical strangers are wont to do. While spending forced bonding time in a cabin, they discover they each possess opposite halves of the same torn photo of their parents. (I assume every child whose parents aren\u2019t together carries a torn photo of their estranged parent in the back pocket of their frayed denim shorts.) The identical nemeses realize they\u2019re actually twin sisters, reconcile over peanut-butter-dipped Oreos, and devise a scheme to reunite their divorced parents. Sister-swapping antics and sexual tension between divorc\u00e9s ensue.\n\nIf you boiled down \u201c\u201990s girl nostalgia\u201d into a sparkly, saccharine sauce, you would get this movie. There are matching bomber jackets, hairdos held up with banana hair clips, and a soundtrack that still makes me bust out in hormonal bacne. There\u2019s an ear-piercing scene that\u2019s forever changed how I look at apples and 12-year-old female aggression. There\u2019s a wedding photo shoot in which Natasha Richardson\u2019s character bravely \u2014 and I cannot stress this enough \u2014 suggests putting a top hat under a bridal veil. However, it is the movie\u2019s poker scene that\u2019s stuck with me to this day.\n\nWe see British Lohan counting American dollars, clearly cleaning up at the makeshift poker table splayed out in one of the camp bunks. \u201cSo, that\u2019s it?\u201d she asks with a cheeky confidence I have yet to perfect in my 28 years of life. \u201cNo more takers?\u201d Then, American Lohan walks into the cabin with a career-making line read of, \u201cI\u2019LL take a WHACK at it.\u201d Sunglasses on, sock of quarters swinging, she comes into frame as the intro of \u201cBad to the Bone\u201d plays.\n\nSome teen movies have girls hash out their issues with dance battles or secret three-way calls. \u201cNo, no,\u201d The Parent Trap said. \u201cWe shall show interpersonal tension in a language that speaks directly to 12-year-old girls: poker.\u201d The two Lohans say things like \u201cdeal me in\u201d and refer to each other by their last names, both crucial elements of Cool Girl canon. I still have no idea what kind of poker game they\u2019re playing, but the child actors in the scene make a good show of acting like they do. The campers ooh and ahh and make knowing eyebrows because I guess this is a camp for card-shark child prodigies. Both Lohans bet quarters and dollar bills among a pot of orange scrunchies, purple hair clips, lip gloss, what looks like maybe a bobby pin or two, and metallic-blue nail polish. Yes, 8-year-old me thought to herself, This is Cool Girl currency.\n\nI never went to summer camp. I say this with zero wistfulness or preteen resentment. My childhood summers were for trips to my grandparents\u2019 house, going to the community pool, and hiding in the pool\u2019s bathroom when suburban girls made fun of my too-tanned skin or hairy upper lip. I\u2019d heard tales of sleepaway camps where girls claimed they flirted with cute camp counselors, sang songs I can still recite the words to (I\u2019d learned them just in case I ever found myself at such a camp), and made friends from across the state they\u2019d keep in touch with forever or at least until next summer. The summer-camp scenes in The Parent Trap, especially this poker one, let me sit quietly on a bunk bed above a room of the pretty white girls who would have been far too cool to hang out with me in real life.\n\nAfter assessing their hands, American Lohan and British Lohan decide to \u201cup the ante\u201d or \u201cmake a deal\u201d or some other poker lingo that means \u201cthe loser has to go skinny-dipping in the lake.\u201d\n\nBritish Lohan reveals her hand, a straight flush. (We all know that this is a good hand and didn\u2019t have to Google it just now or anything.) However, American Lohan beats her hand with a royal flush. She shows her cards and employs one of my favorite acting techniques: a character doing the accent of another character whom they also happen to be playing. (See: Vanessa Hudgens in The Princess Switch.) You have a higher likelihood of getting struck by lightning twice, being eaten by a shark, or finding your identical-twin stranger at summer camp (I\u2019m assuming) than both these hands occurring simultaneously in a poker game. I know there are plenty of logical flaws throughout the movie, but this is my favorite.\n\nThe scene cuts to British Lohan fulfilling her end of the bet, diving into the camp lake completely naked. While submerged, American Lohan and the other girls secretly take all her clothes, leaving her to walk back to camp in the nude save for her shoes. Not even a fake British accent will save you from Cool Girl schemes.\n\nSometimes I wish I hadn\u2019t spend so much of my youth wanting desperately to be loved by people I only sort of liked. (My constant desire to be accepted by Cool Girls is likely the reason I\u2019m still kinda scared of and a little bit horny for Meredith Blake, the movie\u2019s hot and mean stepmom-to-be played by Elaine Hendrix.) Other times I wonder if anyone feels like they have a good poker face all the time. I mean, even people with cheeky confidence and British accents end up showing their whole ass sometimes. In the end, maybe it\u2019s fine if I accidentally show all my cards once or twice or every day of my life.
