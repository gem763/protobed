Personally I really love that storyline. But whether it ends up in the film is yet to be seen.\"\n\n(Image: Marvel comics)\n\nThe Thor: Ragnarok director added: \u201cWe\u2019re not sure if we\u2019re going to do a complete lift of that whole storyline. These things change through the shoot and even when we\u2019re editing sometimes.\n\n\"Like, \u2018Let\u2019s get rid of that storyline where she\u2019s got breast cancer. We\u2019ll change it to something else, or maybe she\u2019s fine.'\u201d\n\nHemsworth and Portman will be joined in the cast by Tessa Thompson, reprising her role as Valkyrie, who is now the ruler of Asgard following the events of Avengers Endgame.\n\nThor: Love and Thunder is released in cinemas on November 5, 2021.\n\nAre you excited for Thor: Love and Thunder?
