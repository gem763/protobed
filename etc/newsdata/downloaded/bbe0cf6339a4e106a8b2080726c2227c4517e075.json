The measure garnered support from all Democrats and 129 Republicans.\n\nWhile the resolution breaks with Trump\u2019s decision, Trump is named just once in the measure when it notes he spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Oct. 6.\n\nThe vote on the House resolution comes as lawmakers are crafting sanctions legislation against Turkey. Engel and McCaul have said they plan to introduce a bill to sanction Turkey, and Rep.
