I followed their wins and losses; I believe I learned to read on Shirley Povich\u2019s column on The Post\u2019s sports page. I studied batting averages; my friends and I made hypothetical trades to improve the team. In real life, nothing improved them much. By the late \u201950s, their owner was (Povich told me later), a vile racist, Calvin Griffith. When the team acquired a few good players, he moved his club to Minnesota, which paid him for the pleasure of his company.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWashington, meanwhile, was given a historically awful expansion team. No one much went to see these new Senators, but my friends and I did. You could sit in the stands at RFK Stadium with a handful of others and enjoy a game. If you called out your favorite player\u2019s name, he might turn and look at you.\n\nWe had a great time and kept going back. We even went to doubleheaders. (They lasted about as long as one game does now.) The league moved our team again in 1971; the owner was Bob Short, a promoter with no money to speak of. Offered some dough to move to Texas, he didn\u2019t hesitate. I was in the stands for the last game.\n\nThat was the end of baseball in Washington until 2005. And then, a new experience. Ted Lerner, an owner with even more experience as a fan than I have (Ted celebrated his 94th birthday on the day the Nationals won their first National League Championship Series), built a good team. He hired a baseball man, Mike Rizzo, and let him put together the franchise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, for the first time in my life, Washington plays in the World Series. I can\u2019t believe it. We\u2019ll be huge underdogs, as a Washington baseball team ought to be. Oh, how I hope we play the Yankees, whose regular humiliations of the Senators were a predictable part of my youth.\n\nThe 2019 players \u2014 Anthony Rendon, Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Juan Soto, Ryan Zimmerman, Howie Kendrick, Trea Turner, all of them \u2014 have made summer a joy for D.C. baseball fans.\n\nBut so did the players on the old Senators and the Nationals teams that didn\u2019t go as far. This week, I feel lucky to be a baseball fan. But then, I always have.\n\nI have one thing to say to this year\u2019s team, and to the old-days and more recent players I\u2019ve watched: the good ones, Frank Howard, Roy Sievers, Camilo Pascual, Chuck Hinton, Jayson Werth and the rest of you. And the really dreadful ones, personified by Herb Plews, who once made three errors in one inning. Even to you, Bryce Harper:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThank you.\n\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of fun watching you at work. And we\u2019ll try to have fun again next week, win or lose.\n\nBut after a lifetime of watching losers, here\u2019s hoping the baseball gods choose to give Washington a World Series championship. This group of players seems to deserve it.\n\nAnd so do we.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "We\u2019ve had a lot of fun watching you at work.", "authors": ["Donald Graham"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GBxiZys2pZKxuDIgn12yMZklqBo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PG2MRDXPY4I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
