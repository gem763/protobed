The Warsaw speech was stunning in this way. I\u2019m glad I read it before I read any of the left-liberal comment on it, else I might have thought it had been drafted by Dr. Goebbels.\n\nHere\u2019s a transcript of the entire speech. Go read it yourself. It won\u2019t take long.\n\nI thought it not a bad speech, if somewhat anodyne in the way all such speeches tend to be. It is risible to hear Donald J. Trump talk about how we need \u201cstrong families\u201d and \u201cstrong values\u201d to survive as a civilization, but the hypocrisy of the speaker doesn\u2019t negate the truth of what he has to say, any more than the great personal virtue of a speaker makes his own claims true (see Jimmy Carter).\n\nHere\u2019s the part that some on the left see as Goebbels-gibberish:\n\nAmericans, Poles, and the nations of Europe value individual freedom and sovereignty. We must work together to confront forces, whether they come from inside or out, from the South or the East, that threaten over time to undermine these values and to erase the bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are. (Applause.) If left unchecked, these forces will undermine our courage, sap our spirit, and weaken our will to defend ourselves and our societies. But just as our adversaries and enemies of the past learned here in Poland, we know that these forces, too, are doomed to fail if we want them to fail. And we do, indeed, want them to fail. (Applause.) They are doomed not only because our alliance is strong, our countries are resilient, and our power is unmatched. Through all of that, you have to say everything is true. Our adversaries, however, are doomed because we will never forget who we are. And if we don\u2019t forget who are, we just can\u2019t be beaten. Americans will never forget. The nations of Europe will never forget. We are the fastest and the greatest community. There is nothing like our community of nations. The world has never known anything like our community of nations. We write symphonies. We pursue innovation. We celebrate our ancient heroes, embrace our timeless traditions and customs, and always seek to explore and discover brand-new frontiers. We reward brilliance. We strive for excellence, and cherish inspiring works of art that honor God. We treasure the rule of law and protect the right to free speech and free expression. (Applause.) We empower women as pillars of our society and of our success. We put faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, at the center of our lives. And we debate everything. We challenge everything. We seek to know everything so that we can better know ourselves. (Applause.) And above all, we value the dignity of every human life, protect the rights of every person, and share the hope of every soul to live in freedom. That is who we are. Those are the priceless ties that bind us together as nations, as allies, and as a civilization. What we have, what we inherited from our \u2014 and you know this better than anybody, and you see it today with this incredible group of people \u2014 what we\u2019ve inherited from our ancestors has never existed to this extent before. And if we fail to preserve it, it will never, ever exist again. So we cannot fail.\n\nAnd:\n\nWe have to remember that our defense is not just a commitment of money, it is a commitment of will. Because as the Polish experience reminds us, the defense of the West ultimately rests not only on means but also on the will of its people to prevail and be successful and get what you have to have. The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive. Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?\n\nI\u2019m sorry, duckies, but how is this all that controversial? An American president, standing in the capital of a nation that suffered in the last century the domination of two tyrannies \u2014 Nazi and Communist \u2014 that tried to eradicate its culture, a nation whose Catholic faith kept its spirit alive and led to its rebirth \u2014 proclaims that there are things unique and valuable about Western civilization, and that we should remember those things, affirm them, and defend them.\n\nThe shocking thing here is that this is controversial at all. It shows how decadent we have become.\n\nLet\u2019s sample some of the left-liberal freakout, shall we?\n\nHere\u2019s Peter Beinart in The Atlantic:\n\nIn his speech in Poland on Thursday, Donald Trump referred 10 times to \u201cthe West\u201d and five times to \u201cour civilization.\u201d His white nationalist supporters will understand exactly what he means. It\u2019s important that other Americans do, too. \u2026 The West is a racial and religious term. To be considered Western, a country must be largely Christian (preferably Protestant or Catholic) and largely white.\n\nOh for pity\u2019s sake, this is pants-soiling stuff. Broadly speaking, what we call the West are the countries and peoples formed by the meeting of Greek philosophy, Roman law, and Hebrew religion. There\u2019s a great deal of diversity within the West, but religion, ideas, art, literature, and geography set it apart from other civilizations. One doesn\u2019t have to wonder long to imagine if Peter Beinart would have seen the world this way were he aboard one of the Venetian warships sailing to meet the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto.\n\nFor that matter, has Beinart ever traveled abroad? Go to Istanbul. Turks are heirs to a great civilization; you have to look no further than the religious architecture of the city to know that. But you also would never mistake Istanbul for a city of the West. So what?\n\nEvery descendant of Africa and Asia who lives in the West and broadly affirms the values that shaped Western civilization is a Westerner. Louis Armstrong and Muddy Waters are as much sons of the West as J.S. Bach and Ludwig von Beethoven. I wrote a book about how reading a poem written by a 14th century Tuscan, Dante Alighieri, utterly changed my life. I have no Italian blood in me at all, but I am part of Dante\u2019s civilization in a way that I simply am not part of the civilization that produced, say, the Analects of Confucius. If not for my mind having been shaped by the Christian narrative, and by Greco-Roman narratives, the poem would not have meant at much to me. Again: so what? This is normal human experience the world over. The civilization shaped by Islam have broad diversity too, but they all share a core belief and experience that binds them.\n\nThank God that the deracinated, de-Christianized EU elite plan to integrate Turkey into the European Union did not work. And if I were a Turk, I would thank Allah for preserving my Islamic country from that fate too. Elites in both countries wish to deny the religious basis of their respective cultures, and pretend that we\u2019re all a bunch of universalists. We\u2019re not, and never will be.\n\nMore Beinart:\n\nThe most shocking sentence in Trump\u2019s speech\u2014perhaps the most shocking sentence in any presidential speech delivered on foreign soil in my lifetime\u2014was his claim that \u201cThe fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.\u201d On its face, that\u2019s absurd. Jihadist terrorists can kill people in the West, but unlike Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, they cannot topple even the weakest European government. Jihadists control no great armies. Their ideologies have limited appeal even among the Muslims they target with their propaganda. ISIS has all but lost Mosul and could lose Raqqa later this year. Trump\u2019s sentence only makes sense as a statement of racial and religious paranoia. The \u201csouth\u201d and \u201ceast\u201d only threaten the West\u2019s \u201csurvival\u201d if you see non-white, non-Christian immigrants as invaders. They only threaten the West\u2019s \u201csurvival\u201d if by \u201cWest\u201d you mean white, Christian hegemony. A direct line connects Trump\u2019s assault on Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship to his speech in Poland. In Trump and Bannon\u2019s view, America is at its core Western: meaning white and Christian (or at least Judeo-Christian). The implication is that anyone in the United States who is not white and Christian may not truly be American but rather than an imposter and a threat. Poland is largely ethnically homogeneous. So when a Polish president says that being Western is the essence of the nation\u2019s identity, he\u2019s mostly defining Poland in opposition to the nations to its east and south. America is racially, ethnically, and religious diverse. So when Trump says being Western is the essence of America\u2019s identity, he\u2019s in part defining America in opposition to some of its own people. He\u2019s not speaking as the president of the entire United States. He\u2019s speaking as the head of a tribe.\n\nI don\u2019t know what was in Trump\u2019s mind (or the mind of his speechwriters) when he delivered that line, but I interpret it like this: Yes, the United States is, at its core, Western, because it is a product of the Enlightenment, which is at its core a secularization of Christian values. The United States makes no sense except as a product of Western civilization. I would say that maintaining Judeo-Christian \u201chegemony\u201d \u2014 meaning understanding ourselves as a people through our unity with the story in the Bible \u2014 is vital to maintaining our identity. We no longer do that, which is why I believe we are in decline. (This is a long story; read The Benedict Option for a longer version.)\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: the defense of classical liberal values depends on the Christian religion (which also entails the Hebrew Bible) far more than secular liberals like Beinart wish to concede. Read Glenn Tinder\u2019s long 1989 Atlantic essay on the political meaning of Christianity. More:\n\nIt will be my purpose in this essay to try to connect the severed realms of the spiritual and the political. In view of the fervent secularism of many Americans today, some will assume this to be the opening salvo of a fundamentalist attack on \u201cpluralism.\u201d Ironically, as I will argue, many of the undoubted virtues of pluralism\u2014respect for the individual and a belief in the essential equality of all human beings, to cite just two\u2014have strong roots in the union of the spiritual and the political achieved in the vision of Christianity. The question that secularists have to answer is whether these values can survive without these particular roots. In short, can we be good without God? Can we affirm the dignity and equality of individual persons\u2014values we ordinarily regard as secular\u2014without giving them transcendental backing? Today these values are honored more in the breach than in the observance; Manhattan Island alone, with its extremes of sybaritic wealth on the one hand and Calcuttan poverty on the other, is testimony to how little equality really counts for in contemporary America. To renew these indispensable values, I shall argue, we must rediscover their primal spiritual grounds.\n\nLet\u2019s move on. Here\u2019s a tweet by Slate\u2019s Jamelle Bouie:\n\nImagine being a political writer in this moment and being utterly unable to identify clear white nationalist dogwhistles. \u2014 Jamelle Bouie (@jbouie) July 7, 2017\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nUm, yeah. Here\u2019s Pope Benedict XVI, in 2006, dog-whistling to the alt-right, on the definition of Europe:\n\nThe last element of the European identity is religion. I do not wish to enter into the complex discussion of recent years, but to highlight one issue that is fundamental to all cultures: respect for that which another group holds sacred, especially respect for the sacred in the highest sense, for God, which one can reasonably expect to find even among those who are not willing to believe in God. When this respect is violated in a society, something essential is lost. In European society today, thank goodness, anyone who dishonors the faith of Israel, its image of God, or its great figures must pay a fine. The same holds true for anyone who dishonors the Koran and the convictions of Islam. But when it comes to Jesus Christ and that which is sacred to Christians, freedom of speech becomes the supreme good. This case illustrates a peculiar Western self-hatred that is nothing short of pathological. It is commendable that the West is trying to be more open, to be more understanding of the values of outsiders, but it has lost all capacity for self-love. All that it sees in its own history is the despicable and the destructive; it is no longer able to perceive what is great and pure. What Europe needs is a new self-acceptance, a self-acceptance that is critical and humble, if it truly wishes to survive. Multiculturalism, which is so passionately promoted, can sometimes amount to an abandonment and denial, a flight from one\u2019s own things. Multiculturalism teaches us to approach the sacred things of others with respect, but we can do this only if we ourselves are not estranged from the sacred, from God. With regard to others, it is our duty to cultivate within ourselves respect for the sacred and to show the face of the revealed God\u2014the God who has compassion for the poor and the weak, for widows and orphans, for the foreigner; the God who is so human that he himself became man, a man who suffered, and who by his suffering with us gave dignity and hope to our pain. Unless we embrace our own heritage of the sacred, we will not only deny the identity of Europe. We will also fail in providing a service to others to which they are entitled. To the other cultures of the world, there is something deeply alien about the absolute secularism that is developing in the West. They are convinced that a world without God has no future. Multiculturalism itself thus demands that we return once again to ourselves.\n\nSo, for Jamelle Bouie, a Westerner asserting the value of Western civilization is barely-veiled racism? If that\u2019s true, then the term \u201cracism\u201d is meaningless. In fact, it\u2019s worse than meaningless: it\u2019s dangerous. If you tell people that to love and to want to defend the culture of the West is a racist act, then they will cease to care about your judgment on the matter, because you are requiring them to hate themselves as an act of virtue. In that regard, Jamelle Bouie\u2019s sentiment here is a much greater gift to the racist alt-right than anything Donald Trump said in Warsaw.\n\nI mean, really, how ignorant and provincial do you have to be, Messrs. Beinart and Bouie, to hear Trump\u2019s speech and think of it as a #MAGA version of a Nuremberg Rally Address? Is the degree of self-hatred of the West required to be a virtuous, woke person such that you cannot tell the difference between Handel\u2019s Hallelujah Chorus and the Horst Wessel Song? Do they really think Kenneth Clark\u2019s Civilisation (all of which is available on YouTube, starting here) is a plummy version of Triumph of the Will? If standing against this kind of liberal insanity means I have to stand with Donald Trump, well, okay, I\u2019ll stand with Donald Trump. I won\u2019t like it, but at least Donald Trump doesn\u2019t hate his own civilization.\n\nHere\u2019s James Fallows on the Warsaw speech:\n\nHas Donald Trump ever heard of Leni Riefenstahl?\n\n:::faceplant:::. I give up. This is madness.\n\nActually, Ross Douthat makes a good point about the liberal freakout over the Warsaw speech. He says that Trump\u2019s rhetoric is a response to the failure of liberal democracy as a universal, and universalizing, force \u2014 something that the mainstream, globalizing left and right shared, and still do.\n\nBut it\u2019s not white nationalism. It\u2019s just \u2026 not. It\u2019s a shift responsive to Bush and Obama-era dashings of universal-civilization hopes. \u2014 Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) July 7, 2017\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nIn that tweet stream (thread starts here), Douthat says that conservatives who are not alt-right talk about \u201cthe West\u201d all the time. It does not make them (us) white nationalists.\n\nTrue, and it\u2019s a contemptible slur to say so. But note well that this is how leading lights on the contemporary mainstream left regard cherishing and defending Western civilization and its particularities. It is not Trump who interprets Western civilization in racial terms; it is they. They\u2019re going to call us all deplorables at best, Nazis and white supremacists at worst. They are going to keep waging culture war, and blame us for being the aggressors. We are going to have to fight back, but as Polish Catholic philosopher Ryszard Legutko once told me, it will not be enough for defenders of the West and its traditions to say what we\u2019re against. We also have to be for something \u2014 and I would add, amplifying his point, we have to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.\n\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me here. The West is certainly no utopia, nor ever has been. It is necessary to criticize ourselves constructively, for the sake of growing in virtue. But that is not what these people are doing. By anathematizing any and all who cherish the culture and history of the West, they will ultimately force conservatives to embrace Reaction as the only bastion of resistance to their nihilistic crusade. But they don\u2019t see it anymore than the Social Justice Warriors grasp that their militant illiberalism is calling up and equal and opposite reaction from the people they have demonized.\n\nThere\u2019s something fitting about Trump\u2019s giving this speech in Warsaw. Every conservative should read Legutko\u2019s book, The Demon In Democracy, a reflection on Poland\u2019s post-communist experience with liberal democracy. Here are excerpts:\n\nHaving cast away the obligations and commitments that come from the past, the communist and the liberal democrat quickly lose their memory of it or, alternatively, their respect for it. Both want the past eradicated altogether or at least made powerless as an object of relativizing or derision. Communism, as a system that started history anew, had to be, in essence and in practice, against memory. Those who were fighting the regime were also fighting for memory against forgetting, knowing very well that the loss of memory strengthened the communist system by making people defenseless and malleable. There are no better illustrations of how politically imposed amnesia helps in the molding of the new man than the twentieth-century anti-utopias 1984 and Brave New World. The lessons of Orwell and Huxley were, unfortunately, quickly forgotten. In my country at the very moment when communism fell and the liberal-democratic order was emerging, memory again became one of the main enemies. The apostles of the new order lost no time in denouncing it as a harmful burden hampering striving for modernity. In this anti-memory crusade, as in several other crusades, they have managed to be quite successful, more so than their communist predecessors.\n\nMore:\n\nThe people, structures, thoughts that exists outside the liberal-democratic pattern are deemed outdates, backward-looking, useless, but at the same time extremely dangerous as preserving the remnants of old authoritarianisms. Some may still be tolerated for some time, but as anyone with a minimum of intelligence is believed to know, sooner or later they will end in the dustbin of history. Their continued existence will most likely threaten the liberal-democratic progress and therefore they should be treated with the harshness they deserve.\n\nAnd:\n\nThe only change that one could imagine happening was one for the worse, which in the eyes of supporters meant not a slight deterioration, but a disaster. The communist would say: if communism is rejected or prevented, then society will continue to be subjected to class exploitation, capitalism, imperialism, and fascism. The liberal democrats would say: if liberal democracy is not accepted, then society will fall prey to authoritarianism, fascism, and theocracy. In both cases, the search for an alternative solution is, at best, nonsensical and not worth a moment\u2019s reflection, and at worst, a highly reckless and irresponsible game.\n\nLegutko has the number of these liberal journalists and commenters. I can\u2019t urge you strongly enough to read his eye-opening book.\n\n\u201cDo we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?\u201d Trump asked. Maybe he was thinking about Islamic terrorists. I\u2019m thinking about the educated barbarians who cannot create a living culture, only live off the last vestiges of one they inherited, even as they scatter salt in its fallow fields. Donald Trump may be the enemy of culture in many respects, but he is in no way as potent an enemy as these mad evangelists for the Anti-Culture.\n\nUPDATE: Douthat is right about this:\n\nOne key to understanding Trump, always, is that he appeals to people by attacking the decadence that he himself also embodies. \u2014 Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) July 7, 2017\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nBut it\u2019s also important to know that many on the left offend and repudiate people who dislike Trump by reacting to him like rabid rats got loose in their shorts. Seriously, when I read the transcript of Trump\u2019s speech yesterday, I thought it was pretty ordinary stuff. The American president saying Western civilization is good and worth defending? This is controversial? And as I\u2019ve said a couple of times in this space, it\u2019s eye-rolling to hear Donald Trump talk about the importance of strong families and strong values. Still, if you\u2019re going to go to pieces every time a politician says something hypocritical, you\u2019ll never be able to get out of bed in the morning.\n\nBut then here comes respectable commenters on the left, like Bouie, Beinart, and Fallows, yammering about fascism, Leni Riefenstahl, and racist dog whistles, and you realize that whether he meant to or not, Trump\u2019s speech was clarifying. I don\u2019t think Donald Trump could write ten meaningful sentences explaining why the West matters, but that\u2019s beside the point. The point is, when talking about the worth and the defense of Western civilization makes you into Hitler McGoebbelsface in the eyes of liberal commentators, then you suddenly see the situation in starker relief.\n\nThe thing is, even if they side with him by default, conservatives must never, ever forget that Trump represents a different form of decadence.\n\nUPDATE.2: This is a fair point by David Frum:\n\nYet the most troubling thing about the speech was the falsehood at its core; the problem is not with the speech, but with the speaker. The values Trump spoke for in Warsaw are values that he has put at risk every day of his presidency\u2014and that he will continue to put to risk every day thereafter.\n\nFrum\u2019s full column calls Trump a hypocrite for giving the speech, and offers a detailed explanation for why. You may or may not agree with Frum \u2014 for what it\u2019s worth, I think he\u2019s mostly right \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly a legitimate criticism. But that\u2019s not the criticism many prominent liberal commentators have made. They have criticized the substance of the speech itself, as if standing up for Western civilization was a vicious, racist act. That\u2019s unnerving.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_485256187.jpg", "published_at": "2017-07-07"}
