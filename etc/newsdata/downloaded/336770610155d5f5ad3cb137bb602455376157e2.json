As a rosacea activist and beauty blogger, the app has become her primary tool for sharing her work and connecting with other people who live with skin differences.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody with rosacea in my real life and it was the internet that gave me all of these people who I could speak to and they would understand,\u201d Gillies told The Verge.\n\nBut over the past few days, her relationship with Instagram has strained. Last week, photographer Sophie Harris-Taylor opened an exhibition in London titled \u201cEpidermis.\u201d The show features models with different skin conditions, like rosacea and acne, on full display. Gillies modeled for one of Harris-Taylor\u2019s photos. To draw awareness to the show, Gillies decided to promote her photo on Instagram and put some money behind it to increase its reach beyond her nearly 20,000 followers.\n\n\u201cI want people to go to the exhibition and for people to see the work,\u201d Gillies said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not very often that you get artists wanting to focus on something like skin conditions, people talking about rosacea.\u201d\n\nBut no matter what she did, Instagram wouldn\u2019t approve her promotion. After first submitting it, she was greeted with a pop-up notification in the app that said, \u201cThis ad isn\u2019t running because it uses images that excessively focus on a person\u2019s body or body part, or depict unlikely before-and-after results.\u201d\n\nShe appealed the decision, and in a handful of follow-up emails, Gillies finally received another response. This time Facebook, which owns Instagram, expanded on the ad policy that led to her inability to promote her post.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t allow ads that focus on aspects of a person\u2019s body to highlight an undesirable or idealized body state,\u201d Facebook\u2019s policy reads.\n\nFacebook lists over a dozen \u201cbody depictions\u201d that the platform does not allow to be promoted, including images that focus on \u201cfat/cellulite\u201d or \u201cill-fitting clothing.\u201d Facebook said that it doesn\u2019t allow users to promote close-ups of ears, nostrils, and feet or \u201cexcessive or grotesque food consumption\u201d like \u201ceating live animals.\u201d\n\nThis list also included close-up images of \u201ca person\u2019s skin with the aim of highlighting medical conditions\u201d like \u201cacne, eczema, and dermatitis.\u201d This is likely why Gillies\u2019 post wasn\u2019t allowed to be promoted.\n\nIn theory, the policy is meant to block predatory ads that target people who are overweight or have skin conditions, pushing unusual and often medically dangerous miracle cures. \u201cAds referring to someone\u2019s body or appearance are personal in nature and we don\u2019t want users to feel singled out,\u201d Facebook explained.\n\n\u201cApparently my skin is put in the same \u2018undesirable\u2019 bracket as \u2018eating live animals\u2019... so that\u2019s nice to know.\u201d\n\nBut in practice, the policy isn\u2019t nuanced enough to recognize ads like Gillies\u2019, which are looking to celebrate those same conditions. Gillies responded to Facebook\u2019s policy on her blog, writing, \u201cApparently my skin is put in the same \u2018undesirable\u2019 bracket as \u2018eating live animals\u2019... so that\u2019s nice to know.\u201d\n\nFacebook has been making this same mistake for years. In 2016, an Australian group called Cherchez la Femme attempted to advertise an event focusing on body positivity and feminism. In the group\u2019s post, they included a photo of Tess Holliday, a famous plus-size model. But the photo fell victim to the same \u201cundesirable\u201d tag, resulting in the entire campaign being blocked. After outcry from the body positivity community, Facebook reversed the decision.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until The Verge reached out to Instagram and Gillies\u2019 followers began to post selfies tagged with #UndesirablesofInstagram that the company decided that her rosacea photo did not violate the platform\u2019s rules. \u201cI looked into it and this ad was rejected in error and we are sorry for the mistake,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now up and running.\u201d\n\nBut until the policy changes in some way, Facebook and Instagram will likely continue to strike down ads that aren\u2019t picturing people as \u201cundesirable,\u201d but rather as desirable figures with bodies worthy of being celebrated and not in need of some miracle cure.\n\nAfter her ad was allowed to run, Gillies told The Verge, \u201cThis response from them is so disappointing. Not only have they completely glossed over the fact that they referred to skin conditions as \u2018undesirable\u2019 but they are point blank refusing to comment on their wider disregard and targeting of the skin positivity community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis campaign was never about the ad,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat was just a tangible symptom of their awful and discriminatory behaviour.\u201d", "description": "A vague policy aimed at countering scams keeps snagging body-positive creators.
