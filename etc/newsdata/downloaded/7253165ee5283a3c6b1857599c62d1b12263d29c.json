It will apply to public gatherings of more than few dozen people. But enforcing the ban could prove difficult given their near ubiquity in the movement.\n\nMany protesters wear gas masks and respirators, as do first-aid responders and journalists, to protect themselves from tear gas. Some wear them to protect their identity, fearful they will be captured in photos and by surveillance equipment, then targeted for retaliation.\n\nBut the face masks, and the anonymity they provide, have given cover to more violent protesters, who have beaten police officers and vandalized property. Undercover police officers have also used masks to disguise themselves as protesters and make arrests.\n\nREUTERS,AFP,NYTimes", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] Hong Kong police fired tear gas to disperse protesters in the New Territories district of Sha Tin on Friday, hours after the government imposed emergency laws designed to quell violent unrest that has roiled the city for four months. .
