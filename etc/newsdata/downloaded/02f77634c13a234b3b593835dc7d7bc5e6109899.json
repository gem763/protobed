One of the most infamous true crime cases is that of Fred and Rose West. Shockwaves were sent around the country in 1994, after it emerged they raped and murdered several young women \u2013 including their own daughters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was later revealed they sexually assaulted, murdered and dismembered at least 12 people, with nine bodies later found on their property at 25 Cromwell Street, in Gloucester \u2013 which was later dubbed the \u2018house of horrors\u2019.\n\nAnd Canon Adrian Slade, from the Diocese of Gloucester, explained the city was \u2018deeply traumatised\u2019 when their crimes came to light.\n\nThey buried people in their \u2018house of horrors\u2019 on Cromwell Street (Picture: Rex)\n\nSpeaking about how the case changed the area, he explained: \u2018There was a lot of grief, a lot of feeling of we should have known. And I think a lot of people were anxious that what happened with Fred West and Rosemary was something they should have been on top of.\n\n\u2018And I think that feeling of grief and anger and sadness penetrated into the whole city. I think the city was deeply traumatised.\u2019\n\nDespite occurring 25 years ago, he explained that some people who live there still identify themselves by the ordeal.\n\n\u2018And I think when you talk to people in Gloucester they still self-identify as a city where the West case occurred,\u2019 he told BBC. \u2018I think Gloucester went through a period of mourning. And I think it\u2019s got through it. I think it\u2019s come out the other side.\u2019\n\nDisappearance of Madeleine McCann: Praia da Luz, Portugal\n\nMadeleine McCann disappeared in 2007 (Picture: PA)\n\nThe world came to a standstill when Madeleine McCann disappeared from the bedroom of her family\u2019s holiday apartment, on 3 May 2007, in Praia da Luz.\n\nFor months afterwards, pictures of the Portuguese town were splashed on front pages and rolling news channels, as the search grew for the three-year-old, who is still missing to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, 12 years after that fateful night, Praia da Luz locals are still struggling to come to terms with what happened \u2013 especially following a recent Netflix documentary about the ordeal.\n\nA local cafe worker explained that even now people often come and ask for more information on exactly where Maddie went missing.\n\n\u2018We do get a lot of people asking, \u201cWhere is the place that Maddie disappeared?\u201d We have to show them on maps a lot of times,\u2019 Jessica Geislinger admitted.\n\nPraia da Luz has never been the same since her disappearance (Picture: PA)\n\nWhile fellow local Ana Faria said: \u2018That summer was totally rubbish and then the following seasons were also very weak and nobody can do anything about it.\n\n\u2018We have to pay the price for somebody else\u2019s problems.\u2019\n\nHowever, despite a \u2018massive drop\u2019 in the number of tourists visiting Praia da Luz since Maddie\u2019s disappearance, a holidaymaker told the publication that the ordeal hasn\u2019t \u2018deterred\u2019 him from coming back.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve been coming here every year regardless,\u2019 he said. \u2018We love it here. It\u2019s still not deterred us. It\u2019s a great little resort.\n\n\u2018It seems to be getting back to what it was now but I don\u2019t think it will fully ever get back to the amount of tourism it had before, simply because some families still choose not to come here.\u2019\n\nHolly Wells and Jessica Chapman deaths: Soham, United Kingdom\n\nHolly Wells and Jessica Chapman were killed in Soham in 2002 (Picture: PA)\n\nSoham, a small town in Cambridgeshire, was cast under a huge spotlight in 2002, after 10-year-old girls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman disappeared, after popping out to by sweets during a barbecue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir bodies were found in a ditch near Suffolk two weeks later, as it emerged school caretaker Ian Huntley had killed them in his home, with girlfriend Maxine Carr providing a false alibi for him.\n\nAnd Pauline Williamson, who was close to Holly\u2019s grandmother, explained those living in the area have \u2018never forgotten\u2019 their crimes.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun, she said: \u2018Oh she was a little beauty. Holly was our carnival queen, so whenever it\u2019s carnival you can\u2019t help but think of her. We will never forget, ever. We can\u2019t. It\u2019s always there.\n\nIan Huntley was found guilty of their murders (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t feel we can ever let go of what happened. You want to, but it changed Soham for ever.\u2019\n\n\u2018We hadn\u2019t lived here long when it happened, but I can remember all of it. It was awful,\u2019 friend Christine Palmer recalled.\n\n\u2018The trouble is that Soham is known only for that to people who don\u2019t live here.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve even had it on holiday in Spain, when people ask where you\u2019re from. When you say, they immediately reply, \u201cOh, isn\u2019t that where those girls were murdered?\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019d be nice if Soham became known for something else. But that will come in time.\u2019\n\nMeredith Kercher death: Perugia, Italy\n\nMeredith Kercher died in Perugia, Italy (Picture: PA)\n\nMeredith Kercher\u2019s death is one of the most famous true crime cases in recent years, and had people around the world gripped.\n\nThe British student was found murdered in the home she shared with Amanda Knox, in Perugia, Italy, in 2007.\n\nAmanda was found guilty of killing her roommate, and spent four years behind bars, before being acquitted by an Italian appeals court in 2011.\n\nAnd locals revealed the town \u2018changed overnight\u2019 following the court case and subsequent media attention \u2013 which was the focus of a recent Netflix documentary.\n\nAmanda Knox was acquitted of her murder (Picture: AFP)\n\n\u2018It used to be like any other university town. I swear that Perugia changed overnight \u2013 this story changed how we all saw our own city,\u2019 a resident told Vice.\n\n\u2018Only now it\u2019s starting to get itself back together, but for years the town was reduced to being the backdrop to this trial.\u2019\n\nWhen asked whether the view of Perugia has been \u2018distorted\u2019, another said: \u2018Well, American students have stopped coming here. For years, we had a wonderful exchange between cultures and generations \u2013 that all disappeared.\u2019\n\nA local continued: \u2018Absolutely. I remember, for example, that when I moved to the centre, people warned me to not go out alone because they said it would be dangerous. I heard people talk about nightly fights, shootings, drugs \u2013 and I think that a lot of that kind of talk is linked to the Kercher case.\u2019\n\nSky has launched new channel Sky Crime, with documentaries on some of the biggest real-life investigations that have made the news of late.
