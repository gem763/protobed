Officials told local media the number was closer to 315,000.\n\nThese figures place the Montreal event among some of the most attended environmental marches in history. The September 2014 People's Climate March in New York attracted at least 310,000.\n\nSchools, colleges and universities suspended all or some classes for the day, and the city government and some businesses have encouraged staff to take the day off. City public transit is also free for the event.\n\nThe march was mostly peaceful, though a man was tackled by police and arrested after approaching Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Hundreds of thousands of people are said to have turned out in Montreal alone\n\nL\u00e9a Ilardo, 21, a university student helping to organise the march, told the BBC she hopes it serves as a demonstration of how important it is to take climate action.\n\n\"Why should we study or work when the survival of humanity and the planet is called into question?\" she said.\n\nFriday's march attracted demonstrators of all ages.\n\nRon and Sue Alward, both in their 70s, activists for decades, said popular interest in environmental issues \"waxes and wanes depending on some unsuspected event, like say, Greta [Thunberg]\".\n\nBut Mrs Alward said that the real problem remains: \"How do we get the politicians on board? The whole system needs to change\".\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption These are the latest protests worldwide inspired by Greta Thunberg\n\nThe march takes place in the middle of Canada's federal election campaign - though many of the students expected to take part are not old enough to vote.\n\nLiberal leader Justin Trudeau, Green Party leader Elizabeth May and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet are in attendance. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh is to join a march in Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nConservative leader Andrew Scheer - who has a large base of support in Canada's oil and gas producing regions - is to be the only leader absent.\n\nHe avoided any of the country-wide marches but has said his party will \"always support\" people raising awareness on climate issues, and some Conservative candidates are expected to attend some events.\n\nIn the lead-up to Friday's marches, and amid a global discussion on climate change, all the campaigns have spent the past week laying out their environmental policies, from home energy retrofitting programmes to setting new climate targets.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC Weather examines what effects a warming world could have had on 2019's extreme weather.\n\nAmong the demands by Climate Strike Canada - the network overseeing the various activist and student groups organising the marches - is a call to reject all new fossil fuel extraction or transportation projects, and to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies.\n\nThat would include the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion project, which is backed by both the Liberals and the Conservatives.\n\nClimate Strike Canada is also calling for net greenhouse gas emissions to be cut 75% over 2005 levels by 2030 - higher than those currently being promised by any of the campaigns.\n\nCanada's current target is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030.\n\nMs Ilardo said the students behind this march hope it will help create a \"break from the status quo\".\n\n\"The strike is not the final point,\" she said. \"For us, it's just the beginning.\"", "description": "The demonstrations come after environmental activist Greta Thunberg called for students to strike.", "authors": ["Jessica Murphy", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9FD8/production/_109002904_hi056852242.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
