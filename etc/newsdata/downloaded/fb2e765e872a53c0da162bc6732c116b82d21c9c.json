This is a welcome step in terms of legitimacy.\n\nBefore caving, the speaker\u2019s note to her caucus mulishly maintains that the star chamber which Democrats have been running \u2014 mainly through Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry Top Republicans say impeachment resolution is too little too late Ex-Trump official's refusal to testify escalates impeachment tensions MORE\u2019s (D-Calif.) Intelligence Committee, with its closed hearings and selective leaking \u2014 has been perfectly proper. This throat-clearing is both telling and misleading.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPelosi purports to regard as \u201cbaseless\u201d the Republican claim \u201cthat the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry\u201d has not been authorized by a vote of the House. Ironically, she observes that the \u201cConstitution provides that the House of Representatives \u2018shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\u201d That is the whole point \u2014 the Constitution vests the impeachment power in the House as an institution, not in the speaker or the majority party. The House only acts as an institution when it votes \u2014 exactly what Pelosi has sedulously avoided.\n\nThe speaker relies on a dubious ruling issued last week by the federal District Court in Washington \u2014 specifically, by Chief Judge Beryl Howell, who was appointed to the bench by President Obama after serving for years as a top aide to the hyper-partisan Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.). Chief Judge Howell directed that grand jury materials from the Mueller investigation be made available to Congress despite the fact that the text of the governing rule limits disclosure to investigations attendant to judicial proceedings. The Trump administration is appealing the decision.\n\nAccording to Pelosi, in rationalizing her ruling, Howell \u201cconfirmed that the House is not required to hold a vote\u201d authorizing an impeachment inquiry. That distorts what the judge said. Howell observed that the historical record on the matter was mixed \u2014 there have been inquiries into whether judges should be impeached that have occurred without a floor vote, while impeachment inquiries involving presidents have had them. But the court\u2019s bottom line was that, because the Constitution puts the House fully in charge of impeachment, a court has no authority to tell the House how to proceed. That is not a judicial endorsement of the Democrats\u2019 position; it is an acknowledgment that a judge is powerless in the matter.\n\nInformed commentators do not contend that Democrats lack the raw power to conduct their inquiry. The six standing committees involved in the inquiry have legitimate oversight authority over intelligence matters, foreign relations, the Justice Department, etc. Even if there were no impeachment inquiry, they could demand testimony and documents pursuant to that oversight authority. The game here is that they have labeled those demands an \u201cimpeachment inquiry,\u201d and they are using the information gathered to consider potential articles of impeachment, but they are taking pains to spare their members \u2014 particularly Democrats who hold seats in Trump-friendly districts \u2014 the need to cast an accountable vote that might hurt them in the 2020 election.\n\nThe problem with this legerdemain is that impeachment is a political, not a legal, matter. Democrats may have the raw power to conduct an inquiry without taking a vote, but that does not mean the public will see their investigation as legitimate. Unless Americans are convinced that the inquiry has been conducted fairly and properly, the articles of impeachment that Democrats are hell-bent on lodging against President Trump Donald John TrumpJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry READ: Army officer to tell investigators he twice reported concerns over Trump's Ukraine dealings Murkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution MORE will be seen as a 2020 campaign stunt.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat is Pelosi\u2019s fear. She still does not want to make the Trump-district Democrats cast difficult votes. There are more than 40 such lawmakers. If voters in their districts are angered by the impeachment push, it could cost Democrats control of the House.\n\nOn the other hand, the public grows suspicious about why Democrats are avoiding a vote. If, as Democrats insist, the president has committed egregious misconduct, they should be proud to vote \u201cyea\u201d on an inquiry. Add to this the Democrats\u2019 choice to proceed behind closed doors, and to withhold witness transcripts while leaking selective portions to their anti-Trump media friends. The process oozes political calculation, not good faith.\n\nSo now, for all the chest-beating about how no vote is legally necessary, Democrats have resigned themselves to its political necessity.\n\nIf Democrats really do have a viable impeachment case, endorsing the inquiry by a vote of the full House can only help them \u2014 at least if it is accompanied by guarantees of transparency and due process: public hearings, disclosure of the transcripts of interviews done in secret, an opportunity for the president\u2019s counsel to cross-examine witnesses and present his own evidence.\n\nNaturally, if the Democrats\u2019 impeachment case is thin, sunlight will not help it. The president\u2019s allies are thus cheering a vote that will put Democrats on record. But it\u2019s a two-edged sword.\n\nPelosi would not hold a vote if the Democrats\u2019 tactics had not had the intended effect of moving public opinion in their direction. According to the Real Clear Politics national average, Americans now favor an impeachment inquiry by a comfortable margin of 51 percent to 42 percent \u2014 and, ominously for the president, the number favoring removal from office is increasing, even among independents (RCP average: plus 2.5 percent in favor). Speaker Pelosi figures that, at this point, a vote to endorse the inquiry will not damage too many Democrats\u2019 electoral prospects, even though the polls are still hostile to the inquiry in pro-Trump districts.\n\nIn addition, President Trump and his allies have relied on the House\u2019s failure to vote as a justification for the administration\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the inquiry. If the House now votes to endorse the inquiry, the pressure will be on the White House to produce the information demanded. If the president fails to comply, the Democrats will look more justified in adding an article of impeachment that accuses the president of obstructing the House.\n\nIt only takes one such article to impeach and remove a president. It is highly unlikely that 20 Republican senators will ever join the Democrats to form the two-thirds\u2019 Senate supermajority that the Constitution requires for removal. Yet, while Republican senators generally do not believe any presidential missteps on Ukraine are serious enough to warrant removal, they might feel differently if the White House obstructs the House after a floor vote has legitimized the impeachment inquiry.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Andrew C.
