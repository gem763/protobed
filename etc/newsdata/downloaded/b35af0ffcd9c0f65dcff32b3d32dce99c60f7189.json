There, it stabilizes for approximately three weeks before being released into the Northumberland Strait.\n\n\n\nThe closure of Boat Harbour is mandated by the Boat Harbour Act passed in 2015. The controversial story of the pulp mill, and what may happen when the effluent stops being pumped into the harbour, is told in the new CBC Docs POV documentary The Mill.\n\n\n\nFor 52 years, the polluted lagoon (see photo above), located in the backyard of Pictou Landing First Nation (PLFN), has significantly impacted the Mi\u2019kmaq community\u2019s way of life. Its members are now counting down the days until Boat Harbour\u2019s closure, changing out numbered tags affixed to a large painting in front of the PLFN Band Council office. The painting depicts Boat Harbour as it was before it became a receptacle for the pulp mill\u2019s effluent, back when it was a pristine tidal estuary the Mi\u2019kmaq First Nation knew as A\u2019se\u2019K or \u201cthe other room.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOn January 31st, when the pulp effluent stops flowing, we\u2019re planning the biggest celebration ever,\u201d says Michelle Francis-Denny, community liaison for the Boat Harbour Remediation Project. But, she adds, there will also be recognition of all the elders they have lost over the years on that day, including all the chiefs they have laid to rest who did not live to see Boat Harbour closed.\n\n\n\nFrancis-Denny grew up listening to elders telling stories of what life and A\u2019se\u2019K were like before the mill was built. \u201cThey tell stories of the white rock that people used to swim to, of being able to hunt and fish and bring food home, to be healthy and live off the land. And the moment that was taken away \u2026 the devastation. When you look at the elders and they talk about that devastation, you can feel the hurt, their pain.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrancis-Denny wonders how different life would be today if her community hadn\u2019t lost A\u2019se\u2019K. \u201cWould our suicide rates be so high? Our drug and alcoholism rates? Our unemployment rates?\u201d she asks. \u201cWe were deprived of a chance to live in a healthy environment. We\u2019ve adapted to just surviving.\u201d\n\nMi'kmaq chiefs protest against pulp waste in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. Photo: K. Knight\n\nFor the past three years, Francis-Denny has been taking information about the remediation project to community members. At first, she says, there was a great deal of skepticism. Even Francis-Denny herself never believed the group would be at the stage they are at now, with their remediation project currently undergoing a federal environmental assessment and set to begin after that.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo me, it was a big dream,\u201d says Francis-Denny. \u201cThe motto for the first year or so was \u2018I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u2019\u201d Then slowly, both Francis-Denny and her community began to believe that Boat Harbour really would be closed and remediated.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so close to it we can touch it. We\u2019ve never been this close before,\u201d she says.\n\nHow it came to this: The story of Boat Harbour\n\nThe story of Boat Harbour\u2019s contamination began in 1965, when a Nova Scotia government official met with the PLFN community to discuss signing over the rights to the estuary so it could be used as a receptacle for pulp mill effluent.\n\nIn The Mill, current PLFN Chief Andrea Paul says community members were led to believe that even with the effluent, the water would remain clear.\n\nBut just days after the effluent started flowing into Boat Harbour, elders recall that the water turned putrid and brown, and all the fish died.\n\n\n\nFor decades, PLFN struggled to regain its rights over Boat Harbour so that it might close the facility and restore the estuary. And for decades, members say their efforts were either thwarted or ignored. Former Nova Scotia environment minister Iain Rankin has called the situation one of the worst cases of environmental racism in Canada.\n\n\n\nThen in June 2014, the mill\u2019s pipeline ruptured, spilling 47 million litres of toxic untreated effluent over sacred Mi\u2019kmaq burial grounds. Led by Chief Paul, PLFN set up a blockade. They refused to allow the mill to repair the pipe and resume operations until they had a guarantee from the Nova Scotia government that it would legislate a closing date for Boat Harbour so a cleanup could begin.\n\n\n\nThe result was the Boat Harbour Act of 2015.\n\nA \u2018small step\u2019 to start the \u2018healing journey\u2019\n\nPart of her job, says Francis-Denny, is to try to maximize the benefits the cleanup will bring \u2014 to try to get PLFN back on track. She says that PLFN has gained a lot of allies in the last two years. The federal government has already allocated $100M to restore the harbour back to its natural state.\n\n\n\nWhen PLFN launched the 365-day countdown to the closing of Boat Harbour in a local school, more than 600 people attended, including many non-Indigenous supporters and fishers. Chief Paul says it was heartening \u201cto see the Indigenous and non-Indigenous fishers come together because they want to protect their waters so much, whatever differences we may have had in the past,\u201d adding that \u201cthe protest brought people together \u2026 [it was] such a healing time.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the gathering, Chief Sidney Peters, the co-chair of the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi\u2019kmaq Chiefs, read out a letter of support from the Assembly to Chief Paul and PLFN. It thanked them for their work on Boat Harbour, something that \u201cwill impact the entire Mi\u2019kmaq nation.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrancis-Denny also sees the remediation of Boat Harbour \u2014 like the new school going up on the reserve and the flourishing fishing industry \u2014 as a positive for the whole community. \u201cWhen we look at the remediation project, we look at it as a place to start to heal, and we aren\u2019t going to be able to start to heal until that water stops flowing into Boat Harbour,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI always think of the quote that says, \u2018You can\u2019t heal in the same environment that made you sick.\u2019 So we look forward to this small step to start our healing journey.\u201d\n\nWatch The Mill on CBC Docs POV.\n\nJoan Baxter is the author of The Mill: Fifty Years of Pulp and Protest, a book on which the documentary The Mill is based.\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Joan Baxter"], "top_image": ""}
