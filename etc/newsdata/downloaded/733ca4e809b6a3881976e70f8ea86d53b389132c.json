Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) on Sunday became the latest prominent Democrat to back Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-Vt.) 2020 presidential bid.\n\n\u201cWe deserve a president who understands that the corporate assault on our lives existed before Trump and it will exist after Trump,\u201d she said at a fiery rally held in her Detroit district. \u201cSomeone who will never back down from a fight with the wealthy and the powerful; who will call them out and bring our movement to their front yards; someone who looks at a problem and finds the most transformative solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe deserve someone who writes the damn bills,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe deserve Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\n\"I am endorsing Amo Bernie Sanders because he's not gonna sell us out. He understands that it's not just about policies and about words, but it's going to be also about completely transforming the structures in place.\" -@RashidaTlaib pic.twitter.com/3SaGZeOUT7 \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 27, 2019\n\nThe endorsement comes one week after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), another member of the House\u2019s \u201cSquad\u201d (a group of young first-year Democratic women of color), publicly threw her support behind Sanders at a massive rally in Queens, New York.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who credits Sanders with inspiring her to run for office, and fellow Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), both announced their plans to endorse Sanders after the Oct. 15 debate. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) is the only Squad member who has not yet endorsed Sanders.\n\n\"When you talk to Bernie, he doesn't talk about making a movement so that he can get elected. He talks about his campaign as part of a mass movement in America. And that's the kind of leadership that I think we need right now.\" -@AOC pic.twitter.com/xaF1WAaw0j \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 19, 2019\n\nTlaib\u2019s formal endorsement adds yet another jolt of momentum to Sanders\u2019 campaign, which faced scrutiny following the 78-year-old\u2019s heart attack earlier this month.\n\nSanders has downplayed critics\u2019 fears that a recent heart attack survivor would not be able to take the White House from President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Sanders said during the Democratic debate in Ohio. \u201cI just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening.\u201d\n\nThe senator was energized Sunday in his speech to supporters, who appeared to mostly be part of the younger voter base he\u2019s known to attract.\n\n\u201cI am begging you, don\u2019t believe anyone who tells you that moving toward a society of justice is impossible. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that our vision is radical or extreme,\u201d Sanders told the crowd after Tlaib\u2019s endorsement. \u201cJustice is not a radical idea. Justice is what we are entitled to as human beings.\u201d\n\nThe rally was held in Detroit\u2019s Cass Technical High School, where alumus and musician Jack White opened the event with a performance.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders is telling the truth and I trust him,\u201d White told the crowd in between songs.\n\nJack White opens with \u201cIcky Thump\u201d at the @BernieSanders rally in Detroit:\n\n\n\n\u201cWhite Americans, what\n\nNothing better to do\n\nWhy don't you kick yourself out\n\nYou're an immigrant too\u201d pic.twitter.com/hE5ZzVOjiK \u2014 Cara Korte (@CaraKorte) October 27, 2019\n\nIn her endorsement video, Tlaib discussed the lack of public school funding, and how that dearth disproportionately affects people in lower-income areas.\n\n\u201cFor me, representing the third poorest congressional district in the country, [Sanders] is in many ways pushing back against this really painful oppression and it\u2019s been incredibly inspiring to see his unwavering support for the same ideals that I have about people over profits,\u201d Tlaib said.\n\nSanders mentioned Detroit\u2019s lack of federal funding for public education when he spoke on Sunday.\n\n\u201cRashida took me around the art district here in Detroit, and I met with beautiful young people who are going to schools in which they don\u2019t have adequate textbooks,\u201d Sanders told the crowd. \u201cThey are going to schools where their teachers are forced to work two or three jobs just to make a living. I don\u2019t think it is too much to ask that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we pay our teachers a living salary.\u201d\n\nPrior to the rally, Sanders and Tlaib visited the Brightmoor Connection Food Pantry in Detroit, the Young Turks\u2019 Emma Vigeland reported.\n\nBernie Sanders and Rep. Rashida Tlaib are currently visiting the Brightmoor Connection Food Pantry in Detroit, talking about poverty, food and water scarcity, and corporate greed. pic.twitter.com/dFuy3NGmuK \u2014 Emma Vigeland (@EmmaVigeland) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cRashida said this better than I can, but today we are saying loudly and clearly to Trump and the corporate elites that this nation belongs to all of us, whether they like it or not, and we are going to end their greed and corruption,\u201d Sanders told supporters on Sunday. \u201cAnd we are going to create an economy that works with the children of Detroit, the children of Vermont. Not a handful of billionaires.\u201d", "description": "The Michigan Democrat is the third member of the \"Squad\" to publicly support the Vermont senator's 2020 bid.", "authors": ["News Editor", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db614f4200000cc27506ed9.jpeg?cache=doh95zebfv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
