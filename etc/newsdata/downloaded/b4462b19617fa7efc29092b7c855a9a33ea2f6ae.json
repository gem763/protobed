In certification documents that Boeing submitted to the F.A.A., MCAS was not evaluated as \u201ca complete and integrated function\u201d on the new plane.\n\nThe report also said Boeing had failed to inform the F.A.A. as the design of MCAS changed during the plane\u2019s development. A New York Times investigation revealed that the system changed dramatically during that process, making MCAS riskier and more powerful, and that key F.A.A. officials were unaware of major changes to the system.\n\nThe task force said the certification documents that Boeing provided to the F.A.A. \u201cwere not updated during the certification program to reflect the changes\u201d made to MCAS. It added that two critical documents that describe the potential dangers of a system like MCAS, the system safety assessment and the functional hazard assessment, \u201cwere not consistently updated.\u201d\n\nBoeing also failed to thoroughly stress-test the design of MCAS, according to the report, which found that \u201cthe design assumptions were not adequately reviewed, updated or validated.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the report criticized Boeing for not adequately assessing the extra effort pilots might have to make to deal with MCAS, and it noted that Boeing had removed mention of MCAS from a draft of the pilot\u2019s manual. As a result of that decision, some key F.A.A. officials were not fully aware of MCAS and were \u201cnot in a position to adequately assess training needs,\u201d the report found.\n\nTo address some of these shortcomings, the report recommends that the F.A.A. update the certification process to allow the agency to be more involved in the design process early on.", "description": "A task force found that Boeing did not adequately describe the system that contributed to two crashes, and that the F.A.A. failed to understand much of what it did share.", "authors": ["David Gelles", "Natalie Kitroeff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/world/11boeing-1/11boeing-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
