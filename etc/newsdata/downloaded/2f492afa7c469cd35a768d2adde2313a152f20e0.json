The home affairs ministry, paraphrasing Shah\u2019s speech, said he was satisfied with the \u201ctimely completion of the process\u201d.\n\nOver the past four years, about 33 million people in Assam have been forced to prove they are citizens by demonstrating they have roots in the state dating to before March 1971. Shah, prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s right-hand man, has previously said India must act against \u201cinfiltrators who were eating the country like termites\u201d.\n\nIndia: almost 2m people left off Assam register of citizens Read more\n\nLawyers have raised serious concerns over the process, which they say has wrongly excluded people on the basis of minor clerical errors in decades-old documents. There are fears that Muslims, women and the poorest communities could be the worst affected.\n\nSenior figures in the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) had so far shied away from commenting on the list, published on 30 August.\n\nModi\u2019s government had backed the National Register of Citizens (NRC), saying it was aimed at weeding out \u201cforeign infiltrators\u201d.\n\nDuring his visit, Shah was expected to be urged by the local BJP leadership to pass legislation to protect the rights of people it says are genuine citizens excluded from the list.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Minister Amit Shah during his visit to Assam.

Those left off the register have 120 days to appeal at foreigners tribunals, and if they fail, they can appeal against that decision through the courts.\n\nThe national government has stressed that those omitted will not become stateless.\n\nTouching on New Delhi\u2019s contentious move on 5 August to strip autonomy from Kashmir, Shah said his government would not revoke another constitutional clause for several states \u2013 most in the northeast.\n\nThe Article 371 clause, which also covers Assam, is aimed at preserving the local culture of those states. \u201cI have clarified in parliament that this is not going to happen and I am saying it again today in Assam,\u201d he said.\n\nOpposition politicians had questioned Modi\u2019s government on whether those special rights would also be scrapped after the Kashmir move.", "description": "Threat comes after controversial project in border state that forced 33 million residents to prove their heritage", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dea9f7761faab00b0ce414c8ed0cab8e99e97129/0_163_5760_3455/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=27f285c980d7fb4238e5190faab12674", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
