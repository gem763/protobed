Sometimes people leave aged care but return later that year or many years later.\n\nPeople leave aged care for a number of reasons, including moving to another facility, going to hospital or returning to the community. The most common reason for leaving permanent care is death, with the proportion rising from 72 per cent in 2008-09 to 83 per cent in 2017-18.\n\nIf you are not permanent, then you may be in care on temporary respite \u2013 for instance, to recover from a procedure or incident, give a carer a break or just to check out a residential care facility before either accepting a permanent bed or returning home.\n\nOnce approved for government-funded respite by the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT), you are entitled to 63 days a year where you pay the equivalent of 85 per cent of the single rate of the age pension, or the basic daily fee which is currently $51.63 a day.\n\nThe average stay in respite care was about 26 days in 2017-18. The average length of stay for permanent residential aged care was almost 30 months, or around two years and six months.\n\nIn the same period the proportion of people moving from one residential care facility to another decreased by a similar share, from 19 per cent to 10 per cent.\n\nA move to hospital from residential care accounted for about three per cent of exits 10 years ago compared to about 1.6 per cent last year.\n\nThe proportion of people moving home from residential care has remained relatively steady for the past decade at about 3 to 3.2 per cent a year, rising to 3.5 per cent in 2017-18.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReturning home\n\nWith a number of innovative home care solutions, including home-based palliative care and the increase in home care packages now operating within a household, it is not unusual to find people taking their loved ones home after a stint in residential care.\n\nUnfortunately once you accept a place in residential care, your home care package will stop. Getting it back, should you decide to go home, could take a while. But there are other care options available.\n\nUnder the Aged Care Act, once you have accepted a \"permanent\" bed you are entitled to 52 days \"social\" leave a year before questions are asked about whether you really need the subsidised bed. The daily charges continue while you are away.\n\nThat makes regular overnight stays at your previous home or holidays with family or friends a feasible option.\n\nLeave, under the Act, is considered to be overnight leave, which means that you can come and go from the facility each day as freely as you like, just as you would in your own home. Visitors are also allowed at any time, as often or for as long as you like \u2013 so long as it\u2019s not interfering with the facility's operations.\n\nThere are plenty of residents who still drive their own car and remain independent even though they are living in aged care. They just notify the facility that they are heading out and may or may not be in for lunch.\n\nWhile some people will dislike the idea of leaving their own home for aged care, for others permanent care will give them living options they may never have experienced. This includes security of tenure, endless hot water and electricity, warmth, regular meals and company. This is particularly relevant to the increasing number of older homeless women in this country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can even run out of money in aged care and, provided it is for reasons beyond your control (like living longer than you anticipated), you will not be kicked out. You can apply for financial hardship and the government will pay the costs.\n\nNot everyone has a choice about a move to aged care. Often it is the only and best care option available.\n\nYou are not a prisoner. Nor can you be thrown out on the street. A permanent bed in aged care can be as comfortable as you want to make it.\n\nBina Brown is a director of aged care solutions company Third Age Matters.", "description": "You are free to pack your things and relocate if you move in and don\u2019t like the place, or your health improves and you can return home.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4425%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_336%2C$y_136/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/52a629ea5922c5e5f148eec2e0635b0982fee236", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
