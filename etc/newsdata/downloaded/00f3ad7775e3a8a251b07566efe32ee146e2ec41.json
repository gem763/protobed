The organization gave 20 SUVs its \"top safety pick\" designation. Of those vehicles, nine were included in the organization's highest tier, \"top safety pick+.\"\n\nTo earn \"top safety pick+,\" a vehicle must perform well in a variety of crash tests. The vehicle must receive a \"good\" rating in tests related to its front, side, roof, and head restraints, an \"advanced\" or \"superior\" rating for front crash prevention and a \"good\" rating for its headlights. (The requirements to earn \"top safety pick\" are similar, though the vehicle can receive an \"acceptable\" rating for a test involving its front passenger-side small overlap and an \"acceptable\" rating for its headlights.)\n\nHyundai had four SUVs on the list, more than any other automaker.
