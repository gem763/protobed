A ruling in favor of Louisiana would give President Donald Trump something to show for his 2016 pledge to appoint \"pro-life justices.\"\n\nThe high court temporarily blocked Louisiana's abortion limits last February, when Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's four liberals in a preliminary skirmish. The law therefore is on hold until the court rules, most likely in the spring.\n\nAbortion rights advocates had complained that the law was virtually identical to the one struck down in 2016. But that Texas decision required the vote of Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired last year and was replaced by Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Roberts dissented in that case, preferring to let the Texas restrictions stand.\n\nAbortion cases are among the most controversial to come before the court, which may be why they don't get there very often. It took almost 20 years after the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide before the justices reinforced both the right to abortion and states' justification in imposing some restrictions.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the court struck down a state law banning late-term abortions, then upheld a similar federal law.\n\nThe court last term upheld an Indiana law requiring the burial or cremation of fetal remains following an abortion. But it refused to consider that state's effort to ban abortions based on sex, race or disability. And in June, it refused to hear Alabama's effort to reinstate its ban against a particular second-term method of abortion.\n\nMore abortion restrictions are headed the high court's way at a time when Roberts and some of his colleagues would prefer a lower profile. Many of those would ban abortions after a certain number of weeks of pregnancy, posing a more direct challenge to the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.\n\nHeading their way: Abortion cases are heading toward the Supreme Court. Can the justices avoid them for long?\n\nEven with a 5-4 conservative majority, the court has not shown much interest in overturning Roe v. Wade. Roberts prefers a more incremental approach, and during his confirmation hearings last year, Kavanaugh referred to a series of Supreme Court rulings affirming the abortion right as \"precedent on precedent.\"\n\nThe question in Louisiana is whether the state can require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Three years ago, the court ruled 5-3 that the hardships for Texas women would be greater than any possible benefits of such hospital affiliations.\n\nDemonstrators protested outside the Supreme Court in 2016, when the justices struck down Texas restrictions on abortion clinics and providers. More\n\nThe Texas restrictions had threatened to close all but nine clinics capable of complying with the new standards, leaving the state unable to handle an estimated 65,000 to 70,000 abortions a year. Proponents of the Louisiana law argued that the impact there would not be as great, but critics said it threatened to leave just one abortion clinic and provider in business to serve an estimated 10,000 women.\n\n\u201cLouisiana is openly defying the Supreme Court\u2019s decision from just three years ago, in which they found an identical Texas law unconstitutional,\u201d Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. \u201cWe are counting on the court to follow it\u2019s precedent. Otherwise, clinics will needlessly close, and there will be just one doctor left in the entire state to provide abortion care.\u201d", "description": "The justices agreed to consider state restrictions on abortion despite their reluctance to become a partisan target.", "authors": ["Richard Wolf", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gchOmaHoK4ef8PENnqNHhQ--~B/aD0yODAwO3c9NDIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/734ce367736673a46028c20af8da0b34", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
