Smith/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe planet is dying, and novelist Jonathan Franzen thinks it\u2019s time to move on. \u201cYou can keep on hoping that catastrophe is preventable, and feel ever more frustrated or enraged by the world\u2019s inaction,\u201d he writes in a recent issue of The New Yorker. \u201cOr you can accept that disaster is coming, and begin to rethink what it means to have hope.\u201d But hope, as Franzen defines it, is a small and fragile thing. He endangers it further with his own pessimism. We cannot stop climate change, he writes, and activists who say otherwise perform a disservice. He compares them to \u201creligious leaders,\u201d who promise hellfire to goad the masses into line. \u201cIf you persist in believing that catastrophe can be averted, you commit yourself to tackling a problem so immense that it needs to be everyone\u2019s overriding priority forever,\u201d he warns. \u201cFalse hope,\u201d as he puts it, can be dangerous. To survive, we must be realists.\n\nThere is no devil and no hellfire except what we create. Activists know this, and here they have the edge on prophets. Just last week, researchers concluded that China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, an infrastructure project that connects developing nations to the superpower like spokes to a carbon-devouring hub, may raise global temperatures. Participating countries could account for 66 percent of the world\u2019s emissions by 2050, Reuters reported, unless China decarbonizes its economy. The U.S., meanwhile, lacks the political will to address its own significant contributes to climate Armageddon. So Franzen is probably correct about one matter: We will not stop climate change. The window for preventing it passed us long ago. But his broader points \u2014 that optimism lulls us into \u201ccomplacency,\u201d that we should aim for smaller, more achievable goals \u2014 fall short of what the times require.\n\nFranzen is not the first person to tell the left that its dreams are too lofty for the world. It\u2019s a familiar enough argument, applied not just to the Green New Deal but to any left-wing bid to avert disaster in the making. Extreme wealth inequality, for example, lacks the specific timetable of ecological collapse, but it is a global problem that brings us closer to social breakdown as it worsens. There are solutions \u2014 radical ones, which would require governments to drastically reconsider their financial priorities \u2014 but the sensible classes in the U.S. and abroad dismiss them as frivolities. But rejection of the radical cures hasn\u2019t led to bipartisan adoption of incremental policy. The notion of raising taxes on the rich to fund public services does not, in isolation, lay out the road to revolution, but that hasn\u2019t prevented its critics from calling it an unworkable plan that would block the wealthy from creating jobs. The U.S. government hasn\u2019t raised the federal minimum wage since 2009, but it\u2019s taken years of organizing work for mainstream Democrats to concede that it may perhaps be time to raise it to $15 an hour. In Europe, centrists and conservatives alike sold austerity as pragmatism, and railed against welfare spending, despite clear evidence that cuts to public funding exacerbated poverty and widened inequality.\n\nWithout hope, there\u2019s no reason to fight, and without imagination, there\u2019s no future to plan. Our solutions have to scale to the problems they\u2019re designed to address. With climate change threatening the stability of our civilization, optimism is a meaningful survival strategy \u2014 the antidote to nihilism, which is a paralyzing state.\n\nClimate disaster is not a one-off, binary proposition. It occurs on a gradient, and so too will its consequences. Our actions will help determine the severity of our dystopia. We can blunt the effects of climate change, but the work will be difficult, and will be made more difficult by people like Franzen, who look toward the future and shrug. One cannot build a political movement on helplessness. Even the incremental solutions he sets forth in his essay require a degree of imagination that he does not appreciate; the post-collapse world he envisions can\u2019t exist without some measure of optimism. He is right to say that our societies must become more resilient if they\u2019re to endure the times to come, and he\u2019s right, too, to point out that we\u2019ll have to distribute wealth more equitably, build more functional democracies, and root out the violent prejudices that tip them closer to collapse. But this \u201cmovement toward a more just and civil society,\u201d as he describes it, demands just as much work as a Green New Deal. It is not an accident that many of the Green New Deal\u2019s most committed backers are socialists, who understand that the planet, and the creatures who live on it, can only survive if we reorder the world.\n\n\u201cIf your hope for the future depends on a wildly optimistic scenario, what will you do ten years from now, when the scenario becomes unworkable even in theory? Give up on the planet entirely?\u201d Franzen asks the void. He writes as though we\u2019ve ever been anything but doomed: We will die and the planet will die and the sun will die. The only uncertainty is the order of events. If we can\u2019t convince ourselves that we are capable of moral evolution, there is no reason to continue. Even if we found new worlds to colonize, our future will be damaged by our nature; our descendants will destroy places we\u2019ll never see.\n\nPolicies like the Green New Deal are ambitious, but the proposal is more than a prevention strategy. It also lays the groundwork for the same post-collapse future that so concerns Franzen. If the Earth is going to remain not just inhabitable, but tolerable, for anyone but a select few, the way we live must radically and permanently change. That\u2019s only possible as long as we believe in our own capacity for progress.
