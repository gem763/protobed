Trump/Twitter\n\nLook, there\u2019s no easy was to say this, so \u2026 actually, yes there is. Donald Trump, the leader of the free world, tweeted a Nickelback meme today. More specifically, a \u201cPhotograph\u201d meme where the photo in the music video has been replaced with a photo of Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and what the video claims is a \u201cUkraine oil exec.\u201d (Trump, amidst the ongoing whistle-blower scandal, is peddling a mostly debunked story that Vice-President Biden interfered in Ukrainian politics to help his son.) \u201cLOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH,\u201d Trump, posting from his personal account, tweeted earlier Wednesday. President Trump\u2019s previous online and IRL behavior should have prepared me fully for this tweet, but, still, when the beat dropped \u2026 reader, I gasped.\n\nLOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH! pic.twitter.com/QQYTqG4KTt \u2014 Donald J.
