At the end of the day, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business and he saw an opportunity to take the biggest leaders from around the world, and he wanted to put on the absolute best show, best visit that he possibly could, and he was very comfortable doing that at Doral,\" Mulvaney said on on \"Fox News Sunday,\" apparently referencing Trump's work as a real estate mogul.\n\nFox News host Chris Wallace Christopher (Chris) WallaceBaier, Bream, Hemmer, Hume, Wallace among interim anchors to fill Shep Smith's 3 PM slot Trump hits Fox News's Chris Wallace over Ukraine coverage White House officials stand by Syria withdrawal, sanctions delay amid bipartisan pushback MORE immediately pushed back, saying bluntly, \"You say he considers himself to be in the hospitality business.

I don\u2019t know what you used to do before you were in media.... He wanted to put on a show. He\u2019s in the hotel business.\"\n\nAsked by Wallace if Trump understood that the optics looked \"lousy,\" Mulvaney insisted the administration could have put on an \"excellent\" G-7 at Trump's Miami-area resort.\n\nMulvaney sparked widespread alarm last week when he announced that the 2020 G-7 summit would convene at one of Trump's properties, with many arguing that the move violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. The clause bars federal officeholders from from receiving gifts or benefits from foreign governments.\n\nSen.

He also pushed back against the appearance of a conflict of interest, stating that the site was chosen after a careful search throughout the U.S.\n\nHe echoed those arguments on Sunday, adding that the administration would put on a formidable G-7 summit someplace else in wake of recent events.", "description": "White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday said President Trump was \"honestly surprised at the level of pushback\" against his decision to host the Group of Seven (G-7) summit at one of his resort properties, adding that Trump\u00a0s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101619upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
