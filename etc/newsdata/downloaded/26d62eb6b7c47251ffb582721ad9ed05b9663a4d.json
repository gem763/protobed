Safiya Nygaard and her fiance Tyler Williams decided to get fake married at a McDonald's in Hong Kong after discovering the ceremony\n\nHer comes the bride: In a YouTube video, Safiya showed all that went into getting married at a McDonald's. Some of the locations provide specific wedding packages\n\nLady and the Tramp style: The wedding package includes a moment where the bride and groom split one French fry between them before kissing\n\n'I figured that during our trip to Hong Kong this year, we had to swing by a Mickey D\u2019s and get not married there,' she continued. 'We\u2019re gonna be trading in golden rings for golden arches.\n\n'I\u2019m lovin\u2019 it, and my husband.'\n\nFun: Safiya also brought in balloon rings she and her fiance could use for the ceremony\n\nThe couple purchased the McDonald's Happiness Party package for $380 \u2014 which includes renting an area of the restaurant for two hours, employee's to run the event, balloon decorations, and other fun activities.\n\n'I was pretty pleased with our spread,' Safiya said about the balloon decorations, 'Besides our decorations, we did have a few people there. As well as Tyler\u2019s parents.'\n\nIn total, the couple had about six guests. Two of whom were Tyler's parents and then four other people they knew through YouTube.\n\nThe wedding started with first dinner with the bride, groom, and all of their guests.\n\n'It was in the end, though appetizing, still normal McDonald\u2019s food,' Safiya said about that portion of the evening.\n\nEveryone picked what type of food they wanted before the actual ceremony. Then after dinner, it was time for the couple to exchange rings and get married.\n\nSafiya revealed how McDonald's used to supply balloon wedding rings for people to wear during the ceremony, but it no longer offered the amenity. So she instead had someone make similar rings for the moment.\n\n'They then directed us to exchange them, which, I think, if there had been a lawyer there, would\u2019ve been the actual marriage part,' Safiya said.\n\nCelebration: The couple got engaged in December after Tyler popped the question during a trip to Disneyland in Los Angeles\n\nSweet surprise: Another fun moment during the ceremony is when employees wheel out a tower of apple pie boxes\n\nYum: The couple was then advised to place two apple pies on top of the tower as the McDonald's way of cutting the cake\n\nEnjoy: Safiya filmed the entire experience of getting fake married in Hong Kong for her followers to witness\n\nMcDonald's will provide a lawyer for the couple to make the nuptials official. But Safiya and Tyler are planning on getting married for real later in the fall, so they decided for the fast food-themed wedding to remain unofficial.\n\nNext during the ceremony involved the couple sharing a single French fry.\n\n'Essentially, they wanted to Lady and the Tramp and \u201ciconic\u201d McDonald\u2019s French fry and kiss in the middle,' the YouTuber detailed.\n\nThe traditions went on with the couple then each drinking out of cups together before they were officially declared not married.\n\nThat was when Safiya's favorite part happened involving the McDonald's staff wheeling out a platter of apple pies, which was described as a 'Jenga tower of apple pie boxes shaped like a wedding cake'.\n\nSafiya and Tyler were then told to place two apple pie boxes on top of the tower as part of the ceremony.\n\nFriends and family: The couple had six guests at their fake nuptials, including Tyler's parents\n\nFirst we feast: Before the ceremony, the bride and groom plus their guests are treated to a meal at McDonald's of whatever they want from the menu\n\nDecor: Employees also take time to decorate the rented space for the couples\n\n'I am still not sure why we did this exactly because it is then the opposite of cutting a wedding cake,' she said.\n\nGuests were then invited to join the bride and groom in wedding games before Safiya tossed her balloon bouquet to end the fast food-themed ceremony.\n\n'I really enjoyed how the inserted fast-food themes into traditional wedding rituals, which made it feel more like a unique experience and not just like a wedding that happened to be a McDonald\u2019s,' Safiya said about the entire event.\n\nAlthough it was an interesting and fun time for the couple, they did not think a McDonald's-themed wedding was actually right for them for their real ceremony.\n\nThe couple is planning to get married later in the fall.", "description": "Safiya Nygaard and her fiance Tyler Williams decided to get fake married at a McDonald's in Hong Kong after discovering the ceremony.", "authors": ["Danielle Zoellner For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19512182-0-image-a-71_1570656053032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
