Hong Kong Leader Slammed for Radio No-Show", "language": "en", "text": "Hong Kong\u2019s number two official met with a dismal reception Friday when he went on radio, in place of the enclave\u2019s embattled leader Carrie Lam, to explain how the government planned to tackle five months of civil unrest.\n\nTwo morning news presenters at government-funded radio station RTHK demanded to know why Lam had not appeared on the show to explain policies herself, asking if she was \u201cscared.\u201d One presenter asked: \u201cWhat is she doing now, that she can\u2019t be on the show?\u201d\n\nTraditionally, Hong Kong leaders appear on the program after giving their annual policy speeches. Lam attempted to give her speech on Wednesday but unruly legislators forced her to abandon the attempt within minutes. She fled the legislature to streams of invective and calls for her ouster, and was forced to deliver the speech later on video.\n\nIn a stark illustration of the administration\u2019s growing isolation, both presenters and callers to the public broadcaster then attacked Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, accusing the government of ignoring demands for democratic reform and the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality.\n\nPresenters poured scorn on Cheung\u2019s suggestion that the government was actively reaching out to the community, saying that the claim \u201cstrains credulity\u201d and pointing out that \u201cin the thousands of hours\u201d that had elapsed since Lam had made such a pledge in August, her dialogue sessions with the public amounted to \u201ctwo and a half hours in reality.\u201d\n\nCheung replied, \u201cWe can\u2019t spend every single minute talking to the community.\u201d\n\nThe chief secretary also said that the establishment of an judicial commission to look into the police force\u2019s handling of the unrest\u2014a key demand of protesters\u2014would duplicate the work of the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), which was working to deliver an initial report by the end of the year. He brushed aside a caller\u2019s concerns that the IPCC had no power to summon witnesses or compel them to testify.\n\n\u201cWe take the view that the IPCC provides an already established and independent mechanism for the task,\u201d he said.\n\nCheung evaded questions on whether an independent commission should look into the government\u2019s culpability in the unrest, which began as opposition to a detested (and now withdrawn) extradition bill but has since snowballed into an increasingly violent push for greater political freedom and self-determination for the former British possession\u2014retroceded to China in 1997 after 156 years of colonial rule.\n\nPresenters excoriated Cheung for the administration\u2019s failure to come up with political solutions to the protests and its continued reliance on the police to bear the brunt of public discontent. \u201cYou\u2019ve left the police exposed in the front line and they have borne the anger,\u201d one presenter said. \u201cYou\u2019re throwing the police to the wolves.\u201d\n\nCheung said that officials were \u201clending our every support\u201d to the police. He emphasized that the government\u2019s \u201cprime task is to restore law and order,\u201d and said that there were no plans to introduce more emergency regulations\u2014besides a ban on masks\u2014\u201din the short term future.\u201d But, he added, \u201cmuch depends on the situation.\u201d\n\nCallers were unanimously hostile during the uncomfortable, hour-long program. One compared the unrepresentative composition of the Hong Kong administration to the apartheid regime and asked if Cheung was prepared for an insurgency as long as the one South Africa went through.\n\nThe chief secretary\u2019s appearance on air caps a disastrous week for the Hong Kong government. Besides Lam\u2019s failed policy address, a question-and-answer session with lawmakers on the following day also broke up amid chaotic scenes.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The Hong Kong administration's claim to be engaging the public \"strains credulity,\" listeners to government-funded radio were told Friday.", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1176176291.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
