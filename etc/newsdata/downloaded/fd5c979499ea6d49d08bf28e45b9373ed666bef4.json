Rick Scott: China Shouldn\u2019t Host 2022 Winter Olympics", "language": "en", "text": "A partial transcript is as follows:\n\nREBECCA QUICK: You are somebody who wants to see negotiations take place and some sort of deals get struck on some of these [U.S.-China trade talks]. What do you think of what we\u2019ve heard so far, because what sounded like a deal feels like it\u2019s not necessarily there yet, but maybe progress has been made?\n\nSEN. RICK SCOTT: You can\u2019t believe there\u2019s ever going to be a deal. This is a government that doesn\u2019t comply with anything. Remember how they agreed to buy stuff earlier this year and they didn\u2019t comply with it? A couple of weeks ago they said they were going to do something and then they changed there mind. They don\u2019t comply with the WTO. Look at Hong Kong, in 1997 they agreed to give basic rights to citizens and oh gosh, that\u2019s gone. For me, this is way bigger than a trade deal. This is a communist Chinese government that doesn\u2019t comply with anything. They don\u2019t let the NBA players speak if they take a chance and say something anti-Xi. I don\u2019t believe there is ever going to be a deal.\n\nQUICK: We shouldn\u2019t believe anything that\u2019s happened to this point? What would you be telling the government to do?\n\nSEN. SCOTT: Be very specific about what we need. One, China has to start showing up and acting responsibly. Open up your markets, you agreed to it when you signed the WTO, so do it. Make sure you stop stealing our technology. Release the million Uyghurs that are in prison, just for there religion. We have American citizens detained now, release them. Give the Hong Kong citizens their rights back. I\u2019m furious with the NBA. They\u2019ll stand up for human rights when it\u2019s convenient, maybe they can sell more jerseys, but gosh, don\u2019t stand up for human rights in China because that might impact there jersey sales or shoe sales. This stuff is ridiculous.\n\nQUICK: [NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver is not welcome in China right now, from what we heard yesterday. Just by saying he will not apologize or force the general manager of the Houston Rockets to apologize.\n\nSEN. SCOTT: He didn\u2019t say that stuff when he was in China\u2026 and now we shouldn\u2019t be doing the 2022 Winter Olympics there. Are they going to tell all the American and world-wide athletes that they can\u2019t you can\u2019t say anything anti-Xi?", "description": "Sen.
