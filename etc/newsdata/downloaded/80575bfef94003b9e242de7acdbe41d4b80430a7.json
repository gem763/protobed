Unlike South Korea, the South Asians are unlikely to progress to the next stage but there is still much at stake.\n\nAfter the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in Colombo that left over 250 dead, first round opponent Macau refused to travel to the island for the return leg of their first-round qualifier in June and forfeited the tie. Sri Lanka is keen to show that life has returned to normal.\n\n\u201cTerrorists have attacked many developed countries in the past and this does not affect carrying out the affairs of any sport,\u201d the country\u2019s football federation declared in a statement. \u201cSri Lanka shall enjoy its right to host the home game in Sri Lanka and every county shall respect each other\u2019s right to host similar games.\u201d\n\nSoutheast Asia also has plenty to play for. The biggest crowd this week will likely be in Jakarta as Indonesia takes on rival Malaysia in front of what is expected to be 80,000 fans.\n\nFeelings between the two neighbors can run high. According to reports in Malaysia, Football Association of Malaysia president Hamidin Mohd Amin has requested that an armored personnel carrier be on standby.\n\n\u201cWe are not worried about the situation at the stadium itself as there are a lot of security personnel from both Malaysia and Indonesia guarding the perimeter,\u201d Hamidin told local media. \u201cBut there is a risk of provocation and chaos en route.\u201d\n\nThailand hosts Vietnam in the same group while Mongolia plays its first ever game in the second round of World Cup qualification and faces Myanmar.\n\nElsewhere, 2022 World Cup host Qatar is placed in Group E and kicks off against Afghanistan. Regardless of how the Asian champion performs, it will not progress to the next stage of World Cup qualification. Qatar is involved as the path to the 2022 World Cup has been combined with qualification for the 2023 Asian Cup which will take place in China.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The 'Korean Derby' may be the most eagerly-awaited game in the second stage of Asian 2022 World Cup qualifiers but before that October meeting, North Korea must first navigate a potentially tricky opening fixture against Lebanon in Pyongyang on Thursday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Duerden"], "top_image": ""}
