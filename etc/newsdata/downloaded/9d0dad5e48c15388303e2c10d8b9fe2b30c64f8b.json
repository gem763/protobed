(Universal Images Group via Getty)\n\nAstronomers have shown the violent flaring at the centre of a black hole using state-of-the-art cameras.\n\nThey used the technology to create a high-frame rate movie of a growing black hole system at a level of detail never seen before.\n\nLed by the University of Southampton, they also uncovered new clues to understanding the immediate surroundings of these enigmatic objects.\n\nBlack holes can feed off a nearby star and create discs of material \u2013 accretion discs \u2013 such as gas, dust and other stellar debris that has come close to it but not quite fallen in. Here, the effect of a black hole\u2019s strong gravity and the material\u2019s own magnetic field can cause rapidly changing levels of radiation to be emitted from the system as a whole.\n\nThis radiation was detected in visible light by the HiPERCAM instrument on the Gran Telescopio Canarias (La Palma, Canary Islands) and in X-rays by Nasa\u2019s NICER observatory aboard the International Space Station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society studied a black hole system called MAXI J1820+070, which was first discovered in early 2018. It is about 10,000 light years away, in our own Milky Way.\n\nA black hole at the center of galaxy M87, outlined by emission from hot gas swirling around it under the influence of strong gravity near its event horizon (Getty Images)\n\nScientists say it has the mass of about seven suns, collapsed down to a region of space smaller than the City of London. The distances of the systems usually make them too faint and small to see, but the HiPERCAM and NICER instruments let the researchers record \u2018movies\u2019 of the changing light from the system at more than three hundred frames per second, capturing violent \u2018crackling\u2019 and \u2018flaring\u2019 of visible and X-ray light.\n\nLead author John Paice, a graduate student at the University of Southampton and the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics in India, said: \u2018The movie was made using real data, but slowed down to one tenth of actual speed to allow the most rapid flares to be discerned by the human eye.\n\nAn artist\u2019s impression of a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.
