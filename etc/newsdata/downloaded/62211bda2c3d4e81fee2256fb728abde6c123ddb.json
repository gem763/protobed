Le Maire wrote:\n\n\u201cI cannot countenance one of a sovereign state\u2019s most powerful tools, monetary policy, falling under the remit of entities not subject to democratic control.\u201d\n\nFrance has taken a hardline stance on Libra, which continues to face pressure from governments around the world.\n\nPreviously, Le Maire announced France as a jurisdiction could not permit its development, due to perceived risks regarding the European Union\u2019s financial structures among other problems.\n\nHis latest piece furthers those arguments. Facebook, the logic goes, cannot gain the same trust as the traditional financial system of governments and central banks.\n\nLe Maire concluded:\n\n\u201cFrance\u2019s position is clear: we want financial innovation to respect the sovereignty of states. Neither political nor monetary sovereignty can be shared with private interests.\u201d\n\nPredictable irony for Bitcoiners\n\nAs Cointelegraph recently noted, Bitcoin (BTC) proponents have largely laughed off objections to Libra by politicians.\n\nFor Saifedean Ammous in his popular book, \u201cThe Bitcoin Standard,\u201d it is in fact governments and central banks that are responsible for the manipulation and destabilization of currencies they now consider under threat.\n\nDivorce from the gold standard beginning in 1914, following Keynesian economics and allowing central banks to intervene in currency performance have all but guaranteed the instability of fiat currency, Ammous argues.\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, removes such control from centralized authorities altogether.", "description": "A Financial Times opinion piece continues Bruno Le Maire\u2019s harsh criticism of Facebook\u2019s unlaunched digital currency, Libra", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvY2EwOTI5ODRhYWI2ZDY3YzQzOTU1MTg0YmY4YzNhMjIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
