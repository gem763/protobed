David Cicilline, the Democratic chair of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the lawmakers the requested documents from Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon included financial materials submitted to the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.\n\nPatrick Semansky/AP\n\n\u201cWe made it clear when we launched this bipartisan investigation that we plan to get all the facts we need to diagnose the problems in the digital marketplace. Today\u2019s document requests are an important milestone in this investigation as we work to obtain the information that our Members need to make this determination,\u201d Cicilline said in a statement. \u201cWe expect stakeholders to use this opportunity to provide information to the Committee to ensure that the Internet is an engine for opportunity for everyone, not just a select few gatekeepers.\u201d\n\nIn one example, the lawmakers want Google to turn over documents about its advertising rules and its acquisition of YouTube.\n\nJeff Chiu/AP Photo\n\n\u201cThe Judiciary Committee is investigating the relationship between big tech and market competition,\u201d said Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga. \u201cWe are continuing to hold hearings and roundtables, but we need more information. This information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, attorneys general from 48 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico announced they were investigating Google and other tech companies.", "description": "A House Judiciary subcommittee on Friday demanded internal documents from Big Tech companies in probe into whether they're stifling competition.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/david-cicilline-ap-jt-190722_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
