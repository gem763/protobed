This is the life of the young black footballer in 2019, who, like young black footballers in generations past, is still likely to be the victim of racism, and still obliged to make the point politely and rationally that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable.\n\nEvery England player nominated for media duty by the Football Association was asked at some point about the issue as they prepare for their games in Prague and then Sofia on Monday night, when there are well-founded fears that Bulgaria fans could again turn on black players. Gareth Southgate has talked his squad through the process should it happen, there has been intensive discussion among the players and there has probably never been an England squad better prepared for that possibility.\n\nEven so, the shadow hangs over another England international and the question once again begs itself: why are black footballers in 2019 still having to formulate a response to the possibility of being racially abused?\n\nAbraham is one of the elite new generation of players scouted by Chelsea in South London and developed from a young age in the most prolific talent-production academy in club football. He won consecutive FA Youth Cups and back-to-back Uefa Youth Leagues in Chelsea\u2019s junior teams and joked that one of the new experiences he had on loan at Bristol City and then Swansea City was being on the losing side more than once in a blue moon.\n\nHe was a schoolboy goal machine, a player whose talent matched his natural physique for the game and meant that, as he grew, the club made sure that he was always challenged by playing one or more years ahead of his peer group. Along the way Chelsea turned down the chance to sign other teenagers in his position to ensure that his path was not blocked. It was always Abraham\u2019s destiny, one felt, to be sat in St George\u2019s Park, surrounded by pictures of England footballers past, discussing his graduation to senior international.", "description": "His first senior England squad since November 2017, and Tammy Abraham will have realised from the initial team meeting on Monday at St George\u2019s Park that the week ahead was going to be dominated by much more than just the football.", "authors": ["Sam Wallace", "Chief Football Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212437311-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq2Mm0MDLB_Hri0Ac4jJl6BA3n25of82S9Yu9u2cMTqdQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
