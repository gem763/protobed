I didn't feel like I should have been the one to approach the club - they should have been telling me what was happening.'", "description": "Chelsea supporter Jerome Bailey, 20, said he was the target of horrific slurs about his skin and hair during the Europa League quarter-final first-leg back in April last season.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/14/20036856-0-image-a-87_1571751211139.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
