He tried to buy a firearm in May but was denied during a background check; Gilreath allegedly left a phone that displayed child pornography when unlocked on a bus that month.\n\nThe search warrants for Twitter and Gab are intended to find out whether Gilreath shared child porn on the sites. The warrant served to Gab (embedded below), however, asks for much more information associated with Gilreath\u2019s account there, such as logs of his activity, all of his communications with other users via the site, financial data, and anything pertaining to possible co-conspirators.\n\nPrior reporting by Fox 31 indicated that the police are using the child pornography charges as the basis to keep Gilreath in custody while they investigate \u201cconcerns over potential terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe charges don\u2019t mention Gilreath sharing child porn on Twitter or Gab, the Daily Beast noted, but other Twitter users reported a now-suspended account run by Gilreath for pedophilia in May. The Daily Beast reported that archives of Gilreath\u2019s deleted Twitter accounts show a highly active and \u201cvirulently anti-Semitic web presence, where he shared content from the leader of a now-defunct white supremacist terror ring.\u201d\n\nGab, run by Andrew Torba, has earned a reputation as a major hub for white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and other bigots due to its racist-friendly \u201cfree speech\u201d policies (though in the past it\u2019s floated conspiracy theories that the racists on there are actually left-wing infiltrators paid to make them look bad \u2014 a theory that makes even less sense when you consider its primary function is to be a place for users who\u2019ve been kicked off of other platforms).\n\nAfter one of its users, vitriolic anti-Semite Robert Bowers, killed 11 people at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life Synagogue in October 2018, Gab\u2019s accounts on payment processors PayPal and Stripe, cloud host Joyent, and domain registrar GoDaddy were terminated.\n\nThe month before, Microsoft had terminated its Azure cloud hosting contract over rampant threats of anti-Semitic violence on the site.\n\nGab later managed to find a payment processor called \u201cSecond Amendment Processing\u201d, whose CEO is reportedly a convicted felon.\n\nGab also found a new web host in a company called Epik, which was booted from internet services company Voxility in August for hosting 8chan, the website where a white supremacist gunman posted a manifesto before killing 22 people and wounding 24 others in El Paso.\n\n\u201cThis account was banned as soon as it was brought to our attention,\u201d Gab told The Daily Beast. \u201cGab has zero tolerance for illegal conduct of any kind. We communicated and fully cooperated directly with federal law enforcement, as required by law, to identify this individual and bring them to justice. As this is an ongoing investigation we have no further comment.\u201d", "description": "U.S. federal authorities have served search warrants to social network and white supremacist haven Gab, as well as Twitter, in an investigation into a neo-Nazi arrested for child pornography in Boulder, Colorado....", "authors": ["Tom Mckay", "Aaron Gordon"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/akyup6p2yi2ywj0g2t1y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
