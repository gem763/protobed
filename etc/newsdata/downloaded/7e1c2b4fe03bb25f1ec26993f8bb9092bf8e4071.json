REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nOn the day that young people around the world staged protests demanding action on climate, the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington was the first round in a legal battle that many expect will outlast Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cMr. President, we\u2019ll see you in court,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.\n\nThe legal fight pits a Democratic majority state that has become the U.S. environmental champion against a Republican president who wants to boost the economy by cutting regulation. The debate already is playing out ahead of the presidential election next year.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s latest move is bad for our air. Bad for our health. Bad for our economy,\u201d said California Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nFor decades, California has played a national role in influencing what Americans drive. The state\u2019s vehicle emissions rules, more stringent than the Trump EPA\u2019s rules, are followed by a dozen other states that account for more than 40% of U.S. vehicle sales.\n\nTrump has said looser tailpipe emissions rules would make vehicles cheaper. Environmentalists argue Trump\u2019s rules will hasten climate change, and that emissions rules improve fuel economy, lowering consumer costs.\n\nFriday\u2019s lawsuit takes aim at a determination unveiled Thursday by the U.S. Transportation Department and its agency the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency concluded that federal law preempts state and local regulation of vehicle fuel economy, including California\u2019s rules.\n\nThe states, led by California and joined by the District of Columbia, Los Angeles and New York City, sued the Transportation Department seeking a court order blocking the determination.\n\nThe states suing include New York, Michigan, Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Washington State and Massachusetts.\n\nThe Transportation Department declined to comment.\n\nThe legal challenge does not address a parallel decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to revoke a 2013 waiver California received under the Clean Air Act to set emissions standards. That does not take effect until late November.\n\nBecerra said the Transportation Department\u2019s determination was unlawful, and that the administration misread federal law and ignored the intent of Congress.\n\n\u201cThe administration insists on attacking the authority of California and other states to tackle air pollution and protect public health,\u201d Becerra said.\n\nThe Trump administration has been waging a multi-pronged battle to counter the state\u2019s efforts to fight climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses from vehicles.\n\nIn August, the Justice Department launched an antitrust probe of Ford Motor Co (F.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), BMW AG (BMWG.DE) and Honda Motor Co (7267.T) that struck a voluntary agreement with California to vehicle reduce emissions.\n\nFILE PHOTO: California Attorney General Xavier Becerra speaks about President Trump's proposal to weaken national greenhouse gas emission and fuel efficiency regulations, at a media conference in Los Angeles, California, U.S. August 2, 2018.
