CNN and the New York Times say those fears stemmed at least in part from President Trump\u2019s loose lips. So who was our man (or woman) in Moscow and why did the since retired agent turn up at the center of yet another political feud over the 2016 election?\n\nWelcome to Rabbit Hole.\n\nWho can it be? The New York Times reported late Monday that the source in the CNN story was the same source that the Times had previously hinted at\u2014a Russian official who wasn\u2019t among Putin\u2019s intimates but was close enough to his decision-making to offer the U.S. a rare glimpse into what the most senior levels of the Kremlin were thinking. After the source had served as a U.S. agent for decades, the CIA offered to extract them. The informant, not wanting to flee home, initially refused, leading to fears that the informant might have been a double agent.", "description": "Russia never managed to find the CIA\u2019s source inside the Kremlin, but the continuing fight over the 2016 election is now catching up with the agency\u2019s Russian superstar spy.", "authors": ["Adam Rawnsley"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568080361/190909-rawnsley-putin-tease_g4089t", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
