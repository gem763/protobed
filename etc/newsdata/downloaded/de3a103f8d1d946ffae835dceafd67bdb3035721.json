That market is dominated by Amazon, Microsoft and Google, with Microsoft Azure taking a strong second-place position against Amazon Web Services.\n\nA new trend, called hybrid cloud, has also emerged for businesses that choose to move some segments of their network to the cloud, while also maintaining huge chunks of their data and applications in private data centers.\n\nMicrosoft's strong presence in the two realms \u2014 private data centers and the cloud \u2014 is giving the company an edge in this market, particularly with businesses that are unable or reluctant to complete move to the cloud, Weiss said.\n\n\"Customers have varying plans and timelines for their digital transformation initiatives,\" he said. Many Microsoft customers \"can confidently invest\" in the company's products geared to private data centers, while exploring options to use Azure, he said.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud momentum was underscored in July when, for the first time since it launched in 2015, its cloud business posted more revenue than its other key businesses, including Office and Windows.\n\n\"We are more confident in the durability of growth, as we were consistently reminded [that] we are in the early days of the large opportunity,\" Weiss said.\n\nMicrosoft's flagship Office 365 business, combined with Windows 10 and and its enterprise mobility and security unit, also remains strong, Weiss said. Those products are packaged together into one subscription-based business, called Microsoft 365.\n\nThe growth of the Microsoft 365 business was highlighted by expanding average revenue per user for Office 365, Weiss said.\n\nWeiss also cited gains from the tech giant's suite of business applications, which includes LinkedIn, the professional social networking platform, Linkedin; Microsoft Dynamics, its line of enterprise business applications; and Power Platform, which enables businesses to build customized software in the cloud with a minimum of coding required.\n\nWeiss highlighted the potential gains from these products which said are \"one of the most important parts of the Microsoft story.\"\n\nThe $1.1 trillion company's shares have climbed more than 35% year-to-date. It was last up nearly 2% on Wednesday at $139.53.\n\nGot a tip about Microsoft or another tech company?
