These include restrictions Moscow imposed on certain observation flights over Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania, and flights near the disputed border between Russia and Georgia.\n\nIn response, the United States in 2016 restricted Russian observation flights over the Pacific Fleet in Hawaii and missile defense interceptor sites at Ft. Greeley, Alaska.\n\nA former Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the treaty was outdated because the United States can share satellite imagery that is not overly sensitive with other countries. The former official also said countries now have access to high-quality commercial satellite photographs. \"We can share satellite overhead depending on how sensitive it is,\" the former official said. \"A lot of this you can get from commercial satellites too.\"\n\nAccording to the Arms Control Association nonprofit group, 34 states are party to the treaty while a 35th, Kyrgyzstan, has signed but not ratified it.
