Mandatory Credit: Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\nThe California rapper, whose songs include \u201cMurder Was the Case\u201d and \u201cSexual Eruption,\u201d appeared in Lawrence, Kansas, on Friday night at an annual event dubbed Late Night in the Phog, which ushers in the school\u2019s basketball season.\n\nVideo posted online showed Snoop Dogg sporting a KU jersey while women in blue shorts and midriff tank tops twirled around poles and a mascot in a dog costume held up a giant marijuana blunt prop.\n\n\u201cI take full responsibility for not thoroughly vetting all details of the performance and offer my personal apology to those who were offended,\u201d KU Athletic Director Jeff Long said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe strive to create a family atmosphere at Kansas and fell short of that this evening,\u201d he said.\n\nA representative for Snoop Dogg did not immediately return a call or email seeking comment.\n\nMany social media users who commented on the performance wondered what school officials had expected from a show by the Grammy-nominated musician, who is known for expletive-laden lyrics and his enthusiasm for marijuana.\n\n\u201cWhat type of morons think there\u2019s anything family friendly about snoop dog? Dummies,\u201d Justin Termine, the host of \u201cNBA Today\u201d on Sirius XM Satellite Radio, wrote on Twitter.\n\nLong posed with Snoop Dogg in a pair of photos that KU\u2019s athletics department posted on Twitter ahead of Friday\u2019s performance, showing them back-to-back and scowling in one and smiling in the other.\n\nLong\u2019s apology came less than two weeks after he had to respond to a notice from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) alleging KU\u2019s men\u2019s basketball and football programs violated the association\u2019s bylaws.\n\nThe school had a \u201clack of institutional control,\u201d the NCAA said.\n\nLong responded that the university self-reported football programme violations that have since been presented by the NCAA. He also said KU officials \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d with the allegations against its basketball programme.", "description": "The University of Kansas has apologised for a performance by rapper Snoop Dogg that featured drug references and dancers on stripper poles, saying the show fell short of creating a \"family atmosphere.\"", "authors": ["Alex Dobuzinskis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437487514&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940K1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
