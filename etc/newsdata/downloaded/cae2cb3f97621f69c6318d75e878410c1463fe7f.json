REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\nOcado and M&S completed the 1.5 billion pound joint venture deal in August, creating Ocado Retail and signalling the end of Ocado\u2019s supply contract with upmarket supermarket chain Waitrose in September 2020.\n\n\u201cThere is a chance we might bring forward, at least partially bring forward, that transition date,\u201d Ocado finance chief Duncan Tatton-Brown told reporters.\n\nBut he said that would require the agreement of all three parties.\n\n\u201cIt may well be in the interests of Waitrose, some of Waitrose\u2019s suppliers and ourselves and M&S for that transition to be slightly more spread out,\u201d he said.\n\nM&S declined to comment while Waitrose, part of the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership [JLPLC.UL], had no immediate comment.\n\nOcado also reported an acceleration in retail sales growth in its third quarter, helped by additional capacity from its fourth automated warehouse.\n\nFor the 13 weeks to Sept. 1, Ocado retail revenue rose 11.4% to 386.3 million pounds, compared with first half growth of 9.7% and guidance of 10-15% growth for the second half.\n\nAverage orders per week rose 12.1% to 314,000 as more slots became available, though average order size fell 0.8% to 105.42 pounds, reflecting a slightly higher frequency of purchases.\n\nIn February Ocado warned that sales growth would be dented until it increased capacity elsewhere after a fire devastated its flagship robotic warehouse in Andover, southern England.\n\nThat extra capacity was secured through a deal with Morrisons (MRW.L), Britain\u2019s fourth-biggest supermarket group, in May to allow Ocado to take back sole use of its fourth robotic warehouse in Erith, southeast London.\n\n\u201cThis first set of results from the joint venture between Ocado Group and M&S show the resilience of Ocado following the Andover fire and the momentum the business now has,\u201d said Ocado Retail CEO Melanie Smith.\n\nShares in Ocado were up 1.2% by 0845 GMT, taking year-on-year gains to 50%.\n\nWhile Ocado\u2019s retail business holds only a 1.4% share of Britain\u2019s grocery market, its warehouse technology has powered the group\u2019s 9.5 billion pound stock market valuation.\n\nOcado has technology deals with eight major retailers, including U.S. group Kroger (KR.N) and France\u2019s Casino (CASP.PA).", "description": "British online supermarket Ocado could start home deliveries of the full Marks & Spencer range before next September, ahead of their joint venture's original deadline, it said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430741583&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0F6", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
