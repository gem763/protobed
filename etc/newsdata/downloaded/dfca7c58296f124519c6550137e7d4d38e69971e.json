Artem Dzyuba scored twice from corners and Magomed Ozdoev thumped home from long range. Aleksandr Golovin then scored from 10 yards in the 84th minute to make it a second consecutive four-goal defeat for Steve Clarke\u2019s side.\n\nWales\u2019s Kieffer Moore keeps Euro 2020 hopes alive against Slovakia Read more\n\nClarke had handed debuts to Michael Devlin, John Fleck and Lawrence Shankland, the latter from the bench, but he is still left seeking a way to turn around Scotland\u2019s form after conceding 13 goals in four successive defeats. The latest ended Scotland\u2019s remote hopes of a top-two finish and left them fifth in Group I, four points behind the third-placed Cyprus.\n\nThey can still qualify for their first major tournament since 1998 via the Euro 2020 play-offs, which begin in March, having earned the chance to progress by winning their Nations League group last year.\n\nClarke felt Scotland\u2019s \u201cfragile confidence\u201d was apparent as they crumbled following the opener.\n\n\u201cWe conceded a soft goal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first goal is soft, from a corner. Man on man we have to do better. From there we quickly found our way out the game. We allowed the game to run away from us. I have to put it down to fragile confidence. The players seemed to lose heart very quickly.\u201d\n\nThe manager urged his squad to make sure that they had hit a low point and start on an upward progression with three games left before the play\u2011offs in March.\n\nWhen asked what was needed, he said: \u201cHard work, maybe one or two different selections in terms of squad as well as starting 11. We can\u2019t keep conceding goals. For us it\u2019s trying to make sure this is the very, very bottom of the lowest and then build from here and make sure come March we are able to be very competitive and get through the play-offs and give ourselves the chance to be in the same championships.\u201d", "description": "Scotland can qualify only via the Nations League play-offs after their miserable campaign continued with a 4-0 defeat in Moscow", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77c748c26a905e89028463d1fe4fbd2917f2022f/0_92_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a6ac3ed833f42ce2f6ccd7568063181", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
