Mr. Maguire is set to testify before Congress this week.\n\n\u201cWe must be sure that the president and his administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the president\u2019s personal or political interest,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said in a rare \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter that she sent to both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\u201cI am calling on Republicans to join us in insisting that the acting DNI obey the law as we seek the truth to protect the American people and our Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower complaint reportedly centers on whether Mr. Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son\u2019s business ties in the country.\n\nDemocrats are worried the president used $250 million in pending aid as leverage in seeking dirt on his main Democratic rival, ahead 2020, though Mr. Trump says he did nothing wrong.\n\nMrs. Pelosi hinted at drastic action if the administration continues to stonewall, as fellow Democrats push for impeachment.\n\n\u201cIf the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
