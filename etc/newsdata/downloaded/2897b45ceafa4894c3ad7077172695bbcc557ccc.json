Local mental health charity Mind HK surveyed 1,048 adults aged 18 and up using the World Health Organisation's Well-being Index, and found that 61 per cent of respondents fell into the \u201cpoor\u201d mental health category, up from 48 per cent last year.\n\nThe campaign is a response to the continued declining trend of mental well-being in Hong Kong. \u201cIt has been a very difficult time for Hong Kong over the last few months, however Hong Kong\u2019s mental health problem has been recognised by the professional community as an issue for several years,\u201d said Cheng Po-wan, the charity's Chief Operating Officer.\n\nA second study released yesterday by Chinese University revealed Hongkongers\u2019 mental health has deteriorated to its worst level in eight years, with ongoing anti-government protests adding to the stress experienced by residents. A total of 1,009 residents aged 15 years old or above on how 10 indicators \u2013 which included work, study, family and social disputes \u2013 affected respondents\u2019 mental health.\n\nSCMP reports the researchers set a mental health index between 0 and 100, with 52 as the passing score. An acceptable mental health level was between 52 and 68, and over 72 showed a good status. The average score this year was 46.41, the lowest ever since the annual survey on Hongkongers\u2019 mental health was launched in 2012. The score was 50.20 last year.\n\nSure there are downsides, but there are ways social media can be beneficial for your mental health\n\nMind HK today launched a campaign to inspire Hongkongers to confront the stigma of discussing mental health, and pledge to change their related behaviour. The #HowOkayAreYou campaign encourages people to talk more openly and honestly about their feelings and emotions, with a dedicated website offering a digital guide on \u201cHow to Ask\u201d and a new language for having important conversations \u2013 in the form of WhatsApp Stickers created by local Hong Kong illustrators.\n\nCheng said: \u201cThe first step to reducing stigma around mental health is to increase the conversation around it. The #HowOkayAreYou campaign aims to inspire people in Hong Kong to engage with each other about their mental well-being and reduce the stigma around the topic of mental health. Informed by local culture and behaviour, the campaign provides tools that help people approach what many in Hong Kong feel is a difficult conversation.\n\n\u201cBy understanding the channels that Hongkongers most commonly use to communicate, and their preferred language for difficult conversations, the campaign is relatable and easy to incorporate into everyday living.\u201d", "description": "Two surveys reveal concerning results but a local charity has launched a campaign aimed at removing the stigma of discussing emotions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/hkharboursept2019martinchan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
