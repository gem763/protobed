On Wednesday, he was honored with a statue representing the state of Nebraska in the U.S. Capitol\u2019s National Statuary Hall.\n\nStanding Bear was born sometime between 1829 and 1834 in the Ponca tribe\u2019s native lands in northern Nebraska. A natural leader, he became a chief at a young age, according to the Nebraska History Museum.\n\nBy 1858, the Poncas were forced to cede most of their land except for a small area by the Niobrara River, where they became farmers rather than buffalo hunters. But they did well, growing corn and trading with white settlers often.\n\nTen years later, as described by Dee Alexander Brown in the classic \u201cBury My Heart at Wounded Knee,\u201d the remaining Ponca land was mistakenly included in a treaty between the United States and the Sioux tribes.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Poncas protested over and over again to Washington, officials took no action. Wild young men from the Sioux tribes came down demanding horses as tribute, threatening to drive the Poncas off the land which they now claimed as their own,\u201d Brown wrote.\n\nThe U.S. government finally took action in 1876 but not in the way the Poncas had hoped. Congress declared that the Poncas would be moved to Indian Territory in Oklahoma in exchange for $25,000. Though the bill stated clearly this would all happen \u201cwith the consent of said band,\u201d when the Poncas declined the inferior land they were offered in Oklahoma, they were forced to leave anyway.\n\n\n\nChief Standing Bear in his formal attire in 1877. (National Anthropological Archives/Smithsonian Institution)\n\nBy the time they arrived in Oklahoma in 1878, it was too late in the season to plant; they also didn\u2019t get any of the farming equipment the government had promised them. More than a third of the Poncas died of starvation and disease \u2014 including Standing Bear\u2019s sister and his beloved son.\n\nStanding Bear and his burial party evaded capture while they traveled home but were caught and detained after visiting relatives at the Omaha reservation.\n\nThe man who caught them, Brig. Gen. George Crook, had been fighting Native Americans for decades, Brown wrote, but he was moved by Standing Bear\u2019s reasons for leaving the Indian Territory and promised to help him.\n\nCrook went to the media, which spread the story of the plight of Standing Bear and his fellow prisoners nationwide. Then two lawyers offered to take up their case pro bono, and asked a judge to free the Poncas immediately.\n\nThough Crook was sympathetic to Standing Bear, since he was the official carrying out the federal government\u2019s orders to detain them, the civil rights case that resulted was called Standing Bear v. Crook.\n\nThe U.S. attorney argued that Standing Bear was neither a citizen nor a person, and as such did not have standing to sue the government.\n\nOn the second day, Chief Standing Bear was called to testify, becoming the first Native American to do so. He raised his right hand and, through an interpreter, said: \u201cMy hand is not the color of yours, but if I pierce it, I shall feel pain. If you pierce your hand, you also feel pain. The blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. The same god made us both. I am a man.\u201d\n\nThe judge agreed, ruling for the first time in U.S. history that \u201cthe Indian is a \u2018person\u2019 \u201d and has all the rights and freedoms promised in the Constitution. The judge also ordered Crook to free Standing Bear and his people immediately.\n\nDespite the landmark decision from the judge, his opinion still drips with prejudice, calling Native Americans a \u201cweak, insignificant, unlettered, and generally despised race.\u201d\n\n[George Washington owned slaves and ordered Indians killed. Will a mural of that history be hidden?]\n\nStanding Bear returned to the land by the Niobrara River and buried his son alongside his ancestors. When he died there in 1908, he was buried alongside them, too.\n\nA few decades later, in 1937, the state of Nebraska sent two statues to the U.S. Capitol. Each state is allowed to pick two historical figures to represent them in National Statuary Hall, and Nebraska chose politician William Jennings Bryan and Arbor Day founder Julius Sterling Morton.\n\n(This provision is also why there are at least eight statues of Confederates in the Capitol. Neither Congress nor the Architect of the Capitol has the power to remove them; it must be done by the states that sent the statues.)\n\nIn recent years, Nebraska lawmakers voted to replace both statues. Bryan was replaced by Chief Standing Bear; soon, Morton will be replaced by a statue of author Willa Cather.\n\nAt the dedication ceremony Wednesday, which included Ponca tribal leaders and members of the House and Senate, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts said it was an honor to recognize \u201cone of the most important civil rights leaders in our country that almost nobody knows about.\n\n\u201cAnd we hope to be able to correct that today and tell his story,\u201d Ricketts said.\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nHow statues of Robert E.
