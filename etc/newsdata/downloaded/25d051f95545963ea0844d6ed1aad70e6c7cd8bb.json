REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nFor Nurse, a roughly 20-hour trek to Canada from Australia one month into the Canberra Capitals\u2019 Women\u2019s National Basketball League season is a small price to pay if it improves her chances of leaving Tokyo with a medal around her neck.\n\n\u201cFor us, we didn\u2019t reach our goal of getting on the podium in Rio (2016 Olympics) and that\u2019s what we want to go after again,\u201d Nurse told Reuters after an event just outside Toronto where Empire Company and its family of brands were announced as the first official grocer of the Canadian Olympic team.\n\n\u201cOur team is really, really different than what we had in Rio. Everybody is really developed... so it\u2019s all about continuing to work towards that goal.\u201d\n\nNurse, who is the face of Canadian women\u2019s basketball, was part of the squad that fell in the quarter-finals in Rio and feels that loss will prove a learning experience for a team comprised of both veteran and well-developed younger players.\n\nThe 23-year-old guard was not with the national team last month in Puerto Rico for the FIBA Women\u2019s AmeriCup \u2014 the first of a three-stage qualification process for Tokyo \u2014 where Canada lost in the final to the United States.\n\nNurse said that run, where fifth-ranked Canada reached the podium for the eighth time in their last nine editions of the AmeriCup despite missing key players, was a testament to the team\u2019s depth.\n\n\u201cIt just shows that our team has always been a team that is more than the sum of its part,\u201d said Nurse, who this year was named a Women\u2019s National Basketball Association All-Star after being the second-leading scorer on the New York Liberty.\n\n\u201cFor us it\u2019s never been a one-man show or a two-man show. We\u2019ve been really good across the board.\u201d\n\n\u2018GREAT TOURNAMENTS\u2019\n\nThe result secured a ticket to Edmonton for a Nov. 14-17 Olympic pre-qualifying tournament where Canada, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Puerto Rico square off with two spots in February\u2019s final global qualification event up for grabs.\n\nThese are the types of tournaments Nurse lives for after having heard many times before from older players about the struggles the national team used to endure, and she refuses to consider a return to those days.\n\n\u201cThey have told us all of the horror stories about how people never really wanted to play against them because it wasn\u2019t worth it for them,\u201d said Nurse.\n\n\u201cBut now we are at this place in the world where we can go to great tournaments all the time and people want to play us in exhibition games just so that we can have a friendly and it\u2019s a great opportunity for both sides.\u201d\n\nBasketball fever swept across Canada in June when the Toronto Raptors won the country\u2019s first National Basketball Association championship and in doing so gave the nation some added swagger.\n\nBut while Nurse said the Raptors\u2019 triumph bodes well for the future of Canadian basketball, it did not give the national team any more pride than they already had.\n\n\u201cWe always knew that we belonged and I don\u2019t think that really ever depended on a men\u2019s team winning a title,\u201d said Nurse. \u201cFor us it was always just a matter of continuing to get better each year so that we could be on the world stage.\u201d", "description": "Canada's Kia Nurse wants to step onto an Olympic podium so badly that she plans to take a break from an Australian league title defence next month to return home and compete in a qualifying event for the 2020 Tokyo Games.", "authors": ["Frank Pingue", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438889859&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981JC-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
