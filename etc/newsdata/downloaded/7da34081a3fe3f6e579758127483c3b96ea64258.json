REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File Photo\n\nGermany\u2019s ruling coalition in September agreed a package worth more than 50 billion euros of measures through to 2023 to protect the climate and boost its green credentials.\n\n\u201cThe recycling economy thinks ecology and economy together like no other branch of industry and must be considered accordingly in this expert council,\u201d Petra Zieringer, president of the German Metal Traders Association (VDM), told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe problem with the debate is that it is almost always about sanctions and hardly ever about rewards. Psychologically, it is not a very good approach.\u201d\n\nUnder the plan, Germany will introduce a carbon dioxide emission price for transport and heating in buildings from 2021, starting at 10 euros a tonne. It will double to 20 euros in 2022 and then rise by 5 euros each year to reach 35 euros in 2025.\n\n\u201cRecycling saves raw materials, energy and also CO2,\u201d Zieringer said, adding that German industry could use more recycled materials and provide a better \u201cecological balance\u201d.\n\nThis would improve CO2 savings, which in 2017 for recycling copper, aluminium and zinc totalled between 6.5 and 8 million tonnes, according to data from the VDM.\n\nClimate-harming emissions in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, fell 4.2% last year to 869 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent, according to data from the federal environment agency, UBA (Umweltbundesamt).\n\nGermany abandoned a self-imposed target of cutting emissions by 40 percent by 2020 as it cannot rein in coal power generation and automotive pollution fast enough.\n\nThe German power sector and energy intensive industries such as aluminium production are already covered by Europe\u2019s Emissions Trading System, where benchmark carbon permits are currently trading around 25 euros a tonne.
