In 1969, the United States was riven violently by an endless war abroad and racial strife at home. President Richard Nixon\u2019s middle-aged \u201csilent majority\u201d stared across a chasm at a mass counter-culture of protest and pot. In Australia, after Gough Whitlam lost the \u201cDon\u2019s Party\u201d election, youthful revolt channelled into the anti-Vietnam War moratorium protests. Globally, a variety of forces spilled over into the economic breakdown of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1989, crowds in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Berlin tore down the Iron Curtain barbed wire, then pushed over the Berlin Wall and a communist monolith with it. In Beijing, a student protester sought to stare down a tank in Tiananmen Square. It seemed to confirm the triumph of Western liberalism and free markets.\n\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall is an example of a popular protest that became a turning point. Hulton Archive\n\nThree decades later, Santiago, Beirut, London, Barcelona and Jakarta have all erupted in different sorts of discontent in recent weeks. Almost everywhere, Extinction Rebellion activists have blockaded cities demanding that capitalism be scrapped before it brings the end of the world, uniting everyone from anti-globalisation Occupy veterans to vegans in a Millennial doom cult. In Hong Kong, with a more immediate cause, a generation barely born when China reclaimed the territory is threatening to overturn one of the world\u2019s financial capitals. Privileged as they often are, Hong Kongers are disenfranchised by the failure of reforms, and locked out of a rigged property market. Just as young Americans once flew Viet Cong flags to enrage their elders, they taunt the Beijing authorities with Catalan independence and British colonial flags. Like Extinction Rebellion, the Hong Kong protesters use civil disobedience to create a tipping point into radical changes \u2013 and with unknown consequences.\n\nThe connection is generational change, economic uncertainty, and new technology \u2013 television then, and social media now \u2013 that spreads the demonstration effect and allows practical organisation. The late historian Robert Conquest said that there was no force like well-educated, underemployed and angry youngsters. He was thinking of Tsarist Russia, though it applies to Islamist radicals in the Middle East or secular Indonesian students protesting at official corruption. But many of the revolts are much greyer. France\u2019s middle-aged yellow jackets made a youthful centrist President Macron look terminal for a while. As always, such movements are simultaneously right, and wrong, and overshoot the mark. Climate change needs to be taken seriously. But the globalisation loathed by the Extinction Rebels and Trumpers alike is still going on as the world\u2019s greatest-ever program of poverty alleviation.\n\nPurely economic\n\nSome of the discontent with globalism seems purely economic. Yellow jackets in hollowed-out France have to drive a long way to a job, so a well-intended fuel tax to combat climate change was disastrous for them. They crankily demanded both lower taxes and more services, underscoring how hard it is to give answers to the left-behind. Across the Channel, Brexit-voting Teesside car workers and wealthy South Coast retirees alike cite identity or sovereignty ahead of their own potential economic self-interest. Perhaps that\u2019s another political strand, one of post-prosperity politics where low inflation and plentiful jobs lets voters take risks to make symbolic points. And Donald Trump has taken all these forces and channelled them inwards to a new patriotic American nationalism \u2013 his own rebellion against any kind of global solution, whether sought by climate radicals or centrist free traders.\n\nIt\u2019s these attacks from both left and right on the same issues that makes governing hard. Australia has not really experienced this, though the Lowy Institute\u2019s Sam Roggeveen has cautioned on these pages that Europe was once a tenth-order concern for British voters, and that sleeper issues \u2013 such as immigration \u2013 could take Australia by surprise. Twenty-eight years of economic growth have brought measures of security, prosperity and complacency. China was only an economic gain for us, and the benefits have been spread evenly. Immigration has created a successful multicultural society, but partly because the borders have been controlled. Australia does not suppress national or regional identities. Opinion polls repeatedly show strong majority support for globalisation. Most of all, we are still an opportunity-based, frontier society. Climate, trade wars and strategic rivalry are global problems that Australia must help resolve, co-operating with others. But we don\u2019t need to import the rest of the world\u2019s angst in doing so.", "description": "Australia shares in the world's problems, but it does not need to import the rage of others with it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2009%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_106/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3c44dc35060fe7bb7e789bc5ade2bb573b47c953", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
