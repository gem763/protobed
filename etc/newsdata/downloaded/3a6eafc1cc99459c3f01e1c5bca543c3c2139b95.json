And that was far from the only great news in Friday\u2019s jobs report.\n\nConsider the Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers for minorities: Hispanic unemployment dropped to 3.9%, setting a new record, while African American joblessness remained at a record low 5.5%.\n\nAnd the rate for adults without a high-school diploma dipped to 4.8% \u2014 the first time it\u2019s gone below 5% since BLS started collecting the data in 1992.\n\nPlus: \u201cWages are up by almost 3%\u201d for the year, noted President Trump, \u201ca fantastic increase for everybody out there working.\u201d\n\nNot all the news was as good: Wages barely grew for September, and the total number of employed Americans grew less than expected, at least in this initial report. (Then again, this BLS release did raise the prior number for job growth in August.)\n\nThe economy is a winning message for Trump, which is why Democrats are desperate to find any negatives. New York\u2019s own Rep. Carolyn Maloney, vice chair of the Joint Economic Committee, claimed that \u201ceconomic growth is clearly starting to slow,\u201d even as \u201ctoo many Americans have yet to fully recover from the recession and enjoy the benefits of the decades-long expansion.\u201d\n\nThis, Maloney charged, shows that \u201cthe president\u2019s economic policies are causing more harm than good.\u201d Tell that to all the folks who are back to work, ma\u2019am.", "description": "After months of unemployment holding at 3.7%, the rate dropped to 3.5% in September \u2014 its lowest since 1969.
