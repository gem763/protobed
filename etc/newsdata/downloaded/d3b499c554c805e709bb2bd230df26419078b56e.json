So it\u2019s apropos that Farrow, in attempting to expose the media\u2019s practice of suppressing information, is facing a lawsuit from a powerful publisher attempting to do exactly that.\n\nDylan Howard, an executive at the mega-tabloid publisher American Media Inc., is suing Farrow and his publisher Little Brown Book Group Limited in an attempt to prevent Catch and Kill from being published. According to the book description, Catch and Kill tells the story of \u201csurveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability and silence victims of abuse.\u201d\n\nHoward has retained attorneys in New York, London, and Sydney to reportedly send threatening letters to the publisher, as well as to stores that plan to stock the book when it comes out on October 15th, according to the Daily Beast. In a letter sent to the British bookstore chain Hive Store Limited, a representative for Howard alleged that Catch and Kill contains \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d allegations about Howard. \u201cWe have put the publisher, Little, Brown Book Group Limited on notice that, if the offending content is included in the book, we are instructed to take such legal action as may be appropriate,\u201d the letter said, advising the bookseller \u201cthat the offending references to our client [be] removed prior to distribution by your company.\u201d\n\nSo who, exactly, is Howard, and why is he so worried about Farrow\u2019s book? Howard is the vice president and chief content officer at American Media Inc., the company that owns US Weekly, In Touch, and a number of other tabloids, including the National Enquirer. Much of Farrow\u2019s reporting on powerful men\u2019s attempts to silence, discredit, and intimidate survivors of sexual assault has been focused on AMI, particularly its alleged efforts to \u201ccatch and kill\u201d stories containing incriminating information about the company\u2019s allies.\n\nIn 2017, Farrow reported in the New Yorker that Howard had sent a reporter to discredit sexual assault allegations made by the actress Rose McGowan against Harvey Weinstein, the now-disgraced Hollywood mogul. In one 2016 email, Howard informed Weinstein about an interview one of his reporters did with the ex-wife of director Robert Rodriguez, who briefly dated McGowan after their divorce, which supposedly contained information that could discredit McGowan. \u201cI have something AMAZING . . . eventually she laid into Rose pretty hard,\u201d Howard said in a 2016 email to Weinstein about the interview.\n\nIn a statement to the New Yorker, Howard said that he had asked the reporter to collect information on Weinstein as part of the due diligence process, as AMI had a (now-defunct) production agreement with Weinstein at the time. Howard denied that he had violated journalistic protocol by providing \u201c\u2018off the record information to Mr. Weinstein,\u201d and said that he \u201cresisted Mr. Weinstein\u2019s repeated efforts to have AMI titles publish favorable stories about him or negative articles about his accusers.\u201d\n\nHoward\u2019s name surfaced again in Farrow\u2019s 2018 New Yorker reporting about David Pecker, the CEO of AMI and a longtime friend of Donald Trump. In the piece, Farrow alleged that AMI paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claimed she had an affair with Trump, a six-figure sum for exclusive rights to her story, offering her the opportunity to pen almost one hundred columns for the company and potentially collaborate on a skincare line, neither of which came to fruition. Farrow reported that the company regularly engaged in such \u201ccatch and kill\u201d agreements, and that AMI did not publish any stories critical of Trump without Pecker\u2019s permission. When another New Yorker journalist attempted to interview McDougal for a separate story about AMI, Howard was allegedly dispatched by AMI to keep her happy, engaging her in discussions about potentially hosting AMI\u2019s future awards show coverage (which also did not come to fruition).\n\nIn a separate 2018 New Yorker story, Farrow reported that AMI had similarly paid off a former Trump Tower doorman who alleged that Trump had fathered a child with one of his employees in the 1980s. When the Associated Press tried to report on the National Enquirer buying and burying the story, Farrow reported that AMI dispatched a legal team led by Howard to discredit the source and successfully prevent the AP from running the story.\n\nIn addition to more information about AMI and Howard, Farrow\u2019s book also reportedly contains new details about NBC\u2019s handling of its investigation into Matt Lauer, the former Today Show anchor who was fired after a former staffer accused him of sexual misconduct. Farrow\u2019s book will reportedly publicly identify Lauer\u2019s accuser for the first time, as well as reveal more allegations against Lauer from former NBC staffers. (Lauer has denied the allegations against him, referring to them as \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d)\n\nPage Six also reports that Catch and Kill will contain more information about the reporting process behind Farrow\u2019s initial Weinstein expose, for which he won a Pulitzer prize. In 2017, Farrow brought the story to his former employers at NBC News before ultimately taking it to the New Yorker, where it was published. Farrow and his producer Rich McHugh have maintained that NBC News went out of its way to kill the story, presumably as a result of pressure from Weinstein, a claim that NBC has long denied.", "description": "Music, Film, TV and Political News Coverage", "authors": ["Ej Dickson", "Ej Dickson'S Most Recent Stories", "Synagogue Shooter Uploaded Terror Video To Twitch Prior To Attack", "Matt Lauer Accused Of Rape According To New Ronan Farrow Book", "The Writer Of The", "Golden Girls", "Theme Is Blowing Up On Tiktok For Being Spooky", "View All"], "top_image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RonanDylan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
