This year's theme is \"don't skip\", encouraging people to appreciate \"the benefits of taking time out to listen to an album from start to finish\".\n\nThe idea is to challenge the cherry-picking approach to music listening that first took hold with the advent of the iPod in 2001.\n\nA recent study by streaming service Deezer found 15% of people below the age of 25 had never listened to an album all the way through.\n\nThe survey of more than 2000 UK-based adults, found that 42% of people simply opted for playlists - either their own, or ones curated by streaming services - rather than playing albums in full.\n\nHowever, a separate study revealed that listening to an album is one of the best ways to de-stress - beating activities like gardening, exercising or taking a nap.\n\nAccording to a survey of 2,019 adults, listening to an album was the third most-popular activity for improving mood and mental well-being, after comfort-eating and reading (which came first).\n\nBear in mind the research was commissioned by music industry body the BPI and the Entertainment Retailers Association to mark National Album Day, so treat the findings accordingly.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
