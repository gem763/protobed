Nor has the State Department. Whether Netanyahu can or will do this is certainly an open question, but it\u2019s a pretty big deal!\n\nOF COURSE, the U.S. has long proposed land swaps between Israel and the Palestinians as part of any peace deal. But that\u2019s not what Netanyahu\u2019s talking about -- he\u2019s proposing officially absorbing relatively large swaths of territory into the state of Israel. That would have been a non-starter with past administrations. It would also go down like a lead balloon with America\u2019s Arab allies -- whose support would presumably be critical to any sustainable solution to the conflict.\n\nBACK IN APRIL, when the annexation question came up at a congressional hearing, Secretary of State MIKE POMPEO declined to say what the administration would do if Netanyahu went ahead with the idea. As the NYT noted at the time, that\u2019s pretty unusual for the U.S. government, which would typically say \u2026 something. We\u2019ve asked both the NSC and State what\u2019s up.\n\nONE THEORY: The U.S. doesn\u2019t want to weigh in ahead of the elections Tuesday in Israel. But that\u2019s lending the impression that the administration tacitly supports the idea, possibly helping Netanyahu as he fends off the centrist Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz. President DONALD TRUMP hasn\u2019t been shy about supporting Bibi\u2019s reelection, so his silence is interesting.\n\n-- REMINDER: Back in June, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said this in an interview with the NYT: \u201cUnder certain circumstances, I think Israel has the right to retain some, but unlikely all, of the West Bank.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t clear if he was speaking for the president.\n\nTODAY IN LAWSUITS BEING RESURRECTED \u2026 JOSH GERSTEIN: \u201cAppeals court revives foreign corruption suit against Trump\u201d: \u201cOn Friday, a panel of the New York-based 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, 2-1, that a district court judge erred in 2017 when he dismissed a lawsuit challenging profits Trump has received from foreign officials doing business with his Washington, D.C., luxury hotel and other Trump-branded properties. The suit also took issue with Trump Organization licensing arrangements approved by foreign governments.\n\n\u201cThe new 2nd Circuit decision sharply rejected a ruling two months ago from another federal appeals court, the Richmond-based 4th Circuit, which tossed out a similar emoluments suit filed in Maryland. Second Circuit Judge Pierre Leval said the 4th Circuit and his dissenting 2nd Circuit College Judge John Walker regarded the suits with too much skepticism because they appeared to be politically motivated.\u201d POLITICO \u2026 The ruling\n\n-- \u201cAppeals Court Revives Seth Rich Lawsuit Against Fox News,\u201d by HuffPost\u2019s Marina Fang\n\nHappy Friday afternoon. SPOTTED: Ric Grenell and Robert O\u2019Brien -- close friends from California, both said to be candidates to be the next national security adviser -- having breakfast at the Trump hotel in D.C. this morning. \u2026 GRENELL was spotted leaving the West Wing around noon.\n\nTRADE WAR COOLING? \u2026 \u201cChina to exempt U.S. pork and soybeans from additional trade war duties, in response to Trump\u2019s tariff delay,\u201d by South China Morning Post\u2019s Zhou Xin\n\nA message from Business Roundtable: Twenty-five years ago, we didn\u2019t have smartphones and the Internet was in its infancy. Today we have new technologies and industries, but North American trade is stuck in a decades-old agreement. USMCA modernizes trade with Canada and Mexico and will create more U.S. jobs.\n\nIMMIGRATION FILES -- \u201cTrump's plan to pay for border wall with Air Force funds risks national security, report says,\u201d by NBC\u2019s Courtney Kube: \u201cPresident Donald Trump's plan to pay for his proposed border wall by taking funds from more than four dozen Air Force military construction projects poses various national security risks for the U.S. armed forces, according to a report compiled by the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\u201cThe report, obtained by NBC News, details the importance of each of the 51 military projects chosen by the Trump administration to lose their funding, including construction of a new gate to address a growing security concern at an overseas U.S. base, projects to build facilities to safely store more than $1 billion in munitions overseas, and even replacing a boiler whose failure is \u2018imminent\u2019 and could cause the evacuation of an entire base in Alaska.\u201d NBC\n\n-- \u201cTrump official urges end to medical exemption for deportations,\u201d by Ted Hesson: \u201cAn internal memo prepared by a top Trump immigration official recommends that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services be stripped of its authority to delay deportations for undocumented immigrants receiving treatment for serious medical conditions. The Trump administration in August quietly halted its processing of such requests, which are known as \u2018deferred action.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cThe memo, obtained by POLITICO, clarifies that the agency would prefer to see its authority removed altogether to grant relief from deportation in such cases. In the memo, USCIS Policy and Strategy Chief Kathy Nuebel Kovarik lays out six options for acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan to take. These range from removing the agency\u2019s deferred action authority to reverting to the earlier status quo.\u201d POLITICO\n\nPOLITICO GETS RESULTS -- \u201cState IG Set to Recommend Discipline for Trump\u2019s Top Iran Hand,\u201d by The Daily Beast\u2019s Erin Banco: \u201cThe State Department is preparing to recommend that the Trump administration\u2019s top representative for Iran policy receive disciplinary action for his role in politically motivated firings of employees at the department, according to two government sources involved in carrying out the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe department\u2019s inspector general has been investigating Brian Hook and other State Department officials for their involvement in layoffs and other personnel decisions that impacted individuals who were thought to have perceived loyalty to the Obama administration. Several whistleblowers raised allegations against Hook and others, prompting the inspector general to analyze emails and other documents as part of the probe. \u2026 Hook is reportedly in the running for national security adviser following [John] Bolton\u2019s departure earlier this week.\u201d Daily Beast \u2026 Halley Toosi\u2019s original 2017 story\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

Bolton, in release, announces \u2018the resumption of the John Bolton PAC and the John Bolton Super PAC.\u2019 Endorses Cotton, Gardner, Tillis, Kinzinger, Zeldin.\u201d\n\nHOW WASHINGTON WORKS, PART 1 -- ANITA KUMAR: \u201cInside the gun lobby\u2019s push to sway Trump\u201d: \u201cAdvocates bombarded the White House with calls and petitions. Representatives scored meetings with senior officials. And the industry even has a former staffer working in the West Wing on legislation. Meanwhile, groups pushing for more restrictions on gun purchases haven\u2019t been able to get in the door.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an all-of-the-above strategy that is helping to shape the package of gun proposals that Trump is expected to release soon. In addition to possible changes to the background check system, Trump will likely include gun lobby-approved offerings meant to address violent video games and mental health treatment, according to several people familiar with the situation. The red flag bill \u2026 may not make the cut.\u201d POLITICO\n\n\u2026 AND PART 2: OPIOID INVESTIGATION -- \u201cInside the drug industry\u2019s plan to defeat the DEA,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Scott Higham, Sari Horwitz, Steven Rich and Meryl Kornfield: \u201cThe industry enlisted members of Congress to limit the powers of the Drug Enforcement Administration. It devised \u2018tactics\u2019 to push back against the agency. And it commissioned a \u2018Crisis Playbook\u2019 to burnish its image and blame the federal government for not doing enough to stop the epidemic.\n\n\u201cThe new information is emerging through the efforts of lawyers in the massive federal lawsuit against two dozen drug companies in Cleveland who have obtained depositions from high-ranking company officials, internal company emails and confidential memos.\u201d WaPo\n\n2020 WATCH -- JOANNE KENEN and DAN DIAMOND: \u201cFrom vaping to opioids: Trump redefines health care for 2020 run\u201d: \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s assault on e-cigarettes is the latest move by the White House to salvage Donald Trump\u2019s health care agenda ahead of the 2020 elections. Turning away from the bitter Obamacare debates that have been a disaster for Republicans, Trump\u2019s been building his disease-by-disease agenda all year, aimed at suburban voters who may be put off by the Democrats\u2019 left turn on health care. His 2020 campaign strategists say this is all intentional. \u2026\n\n\u201cSome of Trump\u2019s initiatives have received qualified support from Democrats and public health experts. But Democrats are flabbergasted by the White House efforts to paint Trump as President Health Care. \u2026 Yet more White House-driven health care policies are coming, and several current and former administration officials described a dual-track effort going into 2020. Keep attacking Obamacare for the base, while carefully constructing a more comforting health care narrative for the center.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cSlow Growth Hasn\u2019t Hurt Trump in Key Midwest Counties,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Aaron Zitner and Dante Chinni: \u201cMore than two years into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, employment growth and other measures of economic robustness in these politically important counties have lagged behind the national trend, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows.\n\n\u201cAnd yet, Mr. Trump\u2019s job-approval rating in the blue-collar counties has risen since he took office, polling shows. Together, the data suggest that even growth below the national rate could be enough to satisfy many voters that Mr. Trump has fulfilled his promises.\u201d WSJ\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Nearly 4 in 10 now say climate change is a \u2018crisis,\u2019 up from less than a quarter five years ago. \u2026\n\n\u201cThough Americans are increasingly worried about climate change, fewer than 4 in 10 say they believe that tackling the problem will require them to make \u2018major sacrifices.\u2019 And most are unwilling to pay for it out of their own pockets.\u201d WaPo \u2026 The poll\n\n-- \u201cAmericans Would Pay \u2014 A Little \u2014 To Save The Planet, A Poll Shows,\u201d by BuzzFeed\u2019s Ben Smith: \u201cYouGov asked people if they\u2019d back new restrictions on fossil fuel infrastructure, like pipelines, and tightening rules around drilling.

A Republican political action committee paid for the provocative advertisement, which aired during the Democratic primary debate on Thursday night. \u2026 The group that paid for the ad, New Faces GOP, states on its website that its mission is to \u2018help elevate the next generation of Republicans\u2019 and recruit more diverse candidates.\u201d NYT\n\nBOOK WATCH \u2026 NYT REVIEW: \u201cIn Edward Snowden\u2019s New Memoir, the Disclosures This Time Are Personal,\u201d by Jennifer Szalai: \u201c\u2018Permanent Record\u2019 is a riveting account and a curious artifact. The book is unlikely to change anyone\u2019s mind about Snowden, but when it comes to privacy and speech and the Constitution, his story clarifies the stakes. \u2026\n\n\u201cWithout belaboring his points, Snowden pushes the reader to reflect more seriously on what every American should be asking already.

What he\u2019s been reading: \u201cI think Tim Alberta\u2019s \u2018American Carnage\u2019 is essential reading for anyone trying to understand the Trump era. It explains how Trump seized the moment in 2016 in the Republican Party and then among the broader electorate. He tapped into the economic desperation felt by many in the working class. Much as \u2018What It Takes\u2019 was the seminal political book of the 1980s and 1990s, I believe Alberta\u2019s book will have similar staying power and resonance for this decade.\u201d Playbook Plus Q&A\n\nA message from Business Roundtable: USMCA modernizes trade with Canada and Mexico and will create more U.S. jobs.
