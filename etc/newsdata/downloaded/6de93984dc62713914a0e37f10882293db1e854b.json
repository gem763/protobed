That doesn\u2019t mean ISIS is.\n\nSDF leader Gen. Mazloum Abdi elaborated on the claims in an interview with NBC Monday, saying the intelligence source, described as one of Baghdadi's security advisers, had also provided U.S. intelligence with a sample of the ISIS leader\u2019s blood, after first obtaining his underwear. A Kurdish official said the underwear was stolen about three months ago, and the blood sample taken a month ago.\n\nAbdi said the intelligence source had been motivated to give up Baghdadi out of a sense of revenge, and had been present at the leader\u2019s compound when the raid took place.\n\nThe description of the critical role played by Kurdish assets in the operation differs from Trump\u2019s account, in which he gave a fleeting acknowledgment of the Kurds for providing \u201csome information that turned out to be helpful,\u201d alongside others including Russia, Syria, Iraq, and Turkey \u2014 which is currently waging a brutal offensive against the Kurds in northern Syria.\n\nAccording to Can, Turkey\u2019s assault on the Kurds \u2014 which was triggered by Trump\u2019s sudden decision two weeks ago to withdraw U.S. military support for the Kurds, a longstanding ally in Syria \u2014 caused the raid on Baghdadi to be delayed.\n\n\u201cMore than a month ago, the decision was made to eliminate al-Baghdadi. However, the U.S. withdrawal and the Turkish invasion prompted us to stop our special operations, including the pursuit of al-Baghdadi. The Turkish invasion caused a delay in the operation,\u201d Can said.\n\nThe latest ceasefire in the offensive, brokered by Russia and Turkey last week, is due to end Tuesday, at which point Russian and Turkish troops will begin joint patrols of a buffer zone along the border that Kurdish forces have withdrawn from.\n\n\n\nREAD: Baghdadi blew himself up \u201cwhimpering and crying,\u201d says Trump\n\nAmid sporadic violence Tuesday, the UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Syrian government forces and the Turkish military had clashed for the first time since Ankara launched its invasion three weeks ago.\n\nAt least six Syrian soldiers were wounded in clashes near the village of Assadiya, south of the border town of Ras al-Ain, the monitoring group said.\n\nCover: People look at a destroyed houses near the village of Barisha, in Idlib province, Syria, Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019, after an operation by the U.S. military which targeted Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the shadowy leader of the Islamic State group.
