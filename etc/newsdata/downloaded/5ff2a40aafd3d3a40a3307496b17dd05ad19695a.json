This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the year Reuters\n\nThe UK is set to leave Europe on 31 October, 2019, though this date could be delayed if parliament votes to block the possibility of a no-deal exit.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said he plans to take the UK out of Europe in time for the Brexit deadline, with or without a deal. If plans to block a no deal are passed then Johnson will likely call for a general election before the Brexit deadline.\n\nSuch uncertainty has seen the pound fall to its lowest level against the US dollar since January 2017. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: \u201cThe outlook for sterling may well worsen if there is an election and will certainly deteriorate if it\u2019s a no deal.\u201d\n\nThe price of bitcoin is notoriously volatile but has seen a steady increase in its price throughout 2019. It has nearly trebled in price since the start of the year but still remains a long way of its record price of close to $20,000, which it hit in late 2017.\n\nThe prospect of an economically damaging Brexit, together with increased trade tariffs between the world\u2019s two largest economies, has helped contribute to bitcoin\u2019s resurgent price.\n\nSome investors are even beginning to see the cryptocurrency as a safe-haven asset, similar to gold.\n\nThis is thanks to its finite supply \u2013 only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist \u2013 and the fact it relies on a borderless and decentralised infrastructure that is less prone to the effects of a single country or market.\n\nNicholas Gregory, CEO of blockchain firm CommerceBlock, recently told The Independent that bitcoin had \u201crediscovered its mojo\u201d in 2019 thanks to an increasingly unstable global economy.\n\n\u201cA no-deal Brexit could see a massive and unprecedented breakout,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNot only will a no-deal departure from the EU create turmoil and volatility across two major fiat currencies, it will also trigger an identity crisis for the global system as the contingency and vulnerability of major global fiat currencies is laid bare.\u201d", "description": "The price of bitcoin has shot up over the last 24 hours amid global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.
