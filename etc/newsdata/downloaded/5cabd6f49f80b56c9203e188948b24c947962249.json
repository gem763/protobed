He is one of our own, he is family, and if it takes all of us piling into a van and driving to the hospital to make sure he got taken care of then that\u2019s what we will do.\u201d\n\nMoore makes himself accessible to supporters via social media and while that has led to some difficult situations, particularly in relation to the club\u2019s failed attempt to trademark the word Liverpool for footballing purposes, he insists it is worth it.\n\n\u201cYou owe people answers, you can\u2019t always provide the answers they are looking for but you owe engagement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf I get some abuse as a result of it then so be it but the benefit of being able to explain situations, particularly ones which are controversial at times, to push information as quickly as you possibly can, outweighs the negatives of the abuse you sometimes get.\n\n\u201cThat is the nature of what we need to be as a modern football club, accountable to our supporters.\u201d", "description": "The Red Neighbours programme has impacted 20,000 people in the L4 and L5 postcodes in terms of foodbanks.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/09/wire-19729616-1571126629-94_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
