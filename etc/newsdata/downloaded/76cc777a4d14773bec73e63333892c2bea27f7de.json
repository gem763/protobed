A 3.5-magnitude earthquake shook the Bay Area, jangling nerves but not resulting in reports of damage or injuries.\n\nThe quake struck at 8:41 a.m. PST, centered 3.7 miles west-southwest of the Bay Area enclave of Colma, the U.S. Geographical Survey reported. But area residents taking to Twitter indicated it was felt from Sunnyvale, in California's Silicon Valley, to Berkeley in the East Bay.\n\n\"Wow that was a good shake, rattle and roll!\" wrote KRON-TV reporter Maureen Kelly on Twitter.\n\nNothing like a little earthquake to get you out of bed in the morning! #colmaquake \u2014 Michael Roy (@mikeroySoft) October 5, 2019\n\nResidents mostly talked about how the shaking struck while they were in bed or in the bathroom, or they talked about how their pets reacted.\n\n\"My cats were not amused,\" said Edie Schaffer, who works in emergency management in the area, also on Twitter.\n\nDefinitely felt this one! Almost ran to the curb in my PJs! https://t.co/V3BovZa6JR#colmaquake \u2014 Timmy Reilly (@timmyreilly) October 5, 2019\n\nSome agencies also used nature's wake-up call to remind residents to take preparations against the far bigger quakes that are expected in California.\n\nSan Francisco was devastated by a 1906 earthquake and fire that killed hundreds. In 1989, sections of the Bay Area were crippled by the Loma Prieta quake, which measured a magnitude of 6.9.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/05/san-francisco-earthquake-strikes-near-colma/3880579002/", "description": "The damage from the earthquake in San Francisco resulted in no reports of damage or injuries \u2014 but people's pets took notice", "authors": ["Chris Woodyard", "Published P.M.
