He complained in anonymous messages on TripAdvisor and Booking.com after viewing two portraits in the hotel entrance of a younger and older man, both apparently members of the German armed forces, with one also wearing an eagle and swastika badge with his uniform, the newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cAt the entrance they display a picture of a Nazi grandpa,\u201d the tourist reportedly wrote in English on one of the sites. \u201cThis made us wonder what the hotel owners are trying to tell us with this image. This incident speaks volumes about the current state of affairs in this region of Austria. Sadly, our desire to visit this mountain region has disappeared completely.\u201d\n\nThe hotel owners demanded both sites remove the reviews. They claimed the label \u201cNazi grandpa\u201d was libelous and defamatory because the two men \u2014 both late relatives \u2014 had been members \u201conly\u201d of the Wehrmacht united armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945, Deutsche Welle reported. Conscripted soldiers could be defamed as Nazis, they argued.\n\nBooking.com removed the review, but U.S.-based TripAdvisor did not. The hotel managed to trace the identity of the reviewer, however, and sued.\n\nThe kicker? Both men had, in fact, joined the Nazi Party, \u201cK\u201d discovered after a search of the German Nationals Archives, according to Deutsche Welle.\n\nThe hotel owners said they had \u201cno idea\u201d \u2014 but the case is pending. The still-unidentified owners are now complaining that their own reputation may be under attack \u2014 and K has countersued in Germany.\n\nThe review has been removed from TripAdvisor, and the portraits have been removed from the hotel lobby.", "description": "The bad online review was \"defamation\" of soldiers in the Nazi armed forces, the hotel owners charged.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d730aa92300002302512699.jpeg?cache=npzughcmrb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
