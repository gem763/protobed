Second-row Dean Budd has that honour today. Tyler Ardron is alongside him at the front of the Canadian line as the two sets of players stride out to the beating of the drums. We will soon be underway in Fukuoka. Today's stadium is, to steal World Rugby's description, \"surrounded by green, verdant forest and on the very doorstep of the wonderfully cosmopolitan yet laidback southern city of Fukuoka\". Nice. A capacity of just over 21,000. And Polledri and his back-row cohort's ability to suck in defenders could tee this Azzurri backline up nicely. It looks one of varied threat and real speed, with Callum Braley providing an injection of pace at scrum-half. Tommaso Allan is a much-improved distributor and with Jayden Hayward starting at 12 for his adopted country for the first time, Italy have two playmaking distributors to get the ball wide and feed a potentially devastating group of outside backs. Michele Campaganro thrives outside of structure and should get plenty of touches with Italy likely to dominate the ball, while the return of Wasps-bound Matteo Minozzi after a serious knee injury adds stardust at full-back. He's quick as a hiccup and Canada can't afford to kick loosely. This is a hugely exciting Italian team. His battle with Italy's back row is hugely intriguing. The Azzurri may be missing the talismanic figure of Sergio Parisse but there is an argument to be made that this trio is better balanced, and with Parisse moving on from the international game at the close of this tournament this looks to be the three to take Italy forward in the future, along with Giovanni Licata who disappointingly isn't in Japan. Jake Polledri is a gainline winning machine, with legs like tree trunks and an almost unparalleled ability to churn them through contact. He uses his upper body really intelligently to make ground in the tackle area, and has the ability to put the toe down. Gloucester have found that he is perhaps best suited to a cameo role, but I'm excited to see Polledri go from the start today. It normally takes two or three to bring him down... Advertisement Canada's key man will be Tyler Ardron, who is a familiar face to fans of Super Rugby as one of the best glue-men in the competition, doing the basics superbly to lend balance to his Chiefs side in New Zealand. Versatile across the back five of the pack, Ardron is strong in the lineout and a busy body around the rucks, but he plays a slightly different role internationally, more the focal point of this Canadian team.\n\nThere are plenty around him who can grit their teeth and grind but Ardron is the potential game-breaker. Expect to see him prominent in attack and defence, and he's got supple hands, too - look out for his offloading game. Japan has really embraced the World Cup so far, and this video of school children singing the Italian national anthem is simply superb: TEAM NEWS - Canada If Canada are to produce a shock it will come without two of their best - Evan Olmstead and his flowing locks are absent due to a lower leg injury and flying France-based wing Taylor Paris is similarly ailed. They will therefore look to captain Tyler Ardron to lead their efforts from number eight and vastly experienced wing DTH van der Merwe to provide the potency out wide. TEAM NEWS - Italy Italy have opted to rest captain Sergio Parisse and make a raft of changes to the side that bested Namibia. Parisse's absence sees an exciting back-row named of power and dynamism, with Sebastian Negri and Gloucester's Jake Polledri flanking Braam Steyn. Callum Braley, also of Gloucester, is inserted at scrum-half, while Jayden Hayward is shifted forward from full-back into a new look and rather exciting midfield with the unpredictable Michele Campagnaro. That accommodates buzzing bumblebee Matteo Minozzi at full-back. Dean Budd captains from the second row alongside former England youth representative David Sisi. Advertisement Italy got underway in solid-enough fashion against Namibia, moving past a potentially tricky opponent with seven tries. But Conor O'Shea's men showed some defensive vulnerability in that game, and Canada are no walkovers, as they proved at the last World Cup, pushing the Azzurri all the way but falling to a 23-18 defeat. They'll be looking for revenge today. Spookily, that game occurred exactly four years ago at Elland Road - can Canada follow Uruguay's lead from yesterday and knock-off a more fancied opponent? To Fukuoka the Rugby World Cup ventures for the first time as the tournament continues with an intriguing Pool B clash, with Canada (the last team to qualify for this tournament via the repechage) entering the fray.
