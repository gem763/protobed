He\u2019s just turning into an old white lady.\n\n\u201cI mean, he used to be, like, one of the coolest black dudes on earth,\u201d Che continued. \u201cNow he\u2019s showing up to events in sweatpants and orthopedic sneakers, listening to Kenny G and trying to get black people to like Trump. It\u2019s like, how long before this guy changes his name to Kathy?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe audience laughed until Che\u2019s final joke, which was met with silence, aside from a few groans. Beginning with, \u201cNow, you might think I\u2019m crazy,\u201d he went on to refer to Caitlyn Jenner \u2014 the reality star and former Olympian who was married until 2015 to West\u2019s mother-in-law, Kris \u2014 as another \u201cfella\u201d who moved to Calabasas, Calif., turning the joke about West into one mocking and misgendering the transgender woman. (Che also deadnamed Jenner, or called her by the birth name she no longer uses.)\n\nThe debate over where the line is between provocative and offensive humor has become more prevalent in recent years, and comedians have defended themselves by pointing out that the remarks in question were made in jest. That defense is often fair on its own, as jokes don\u2019t necessarily reflect the personal views of the people who make them, but it can also fall apart when placed in a larger context.\n\nTake Dave Chappelle, who set his target on \u201ccancel culture\u201d in his newest Netflix special, \u201cSticks & Stones.\u201d Though the popular comedian built a career out of irreverent social commentary, the special\u2019s largely negative reviews suggest that in some cases, he made jokes solely for the sake of provoking \u2014 among them, a bit where he does a stereotypical impression of a Chinese man after claiming that if trans people were born in the wrong body, then the same logic should apply to race.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChe responded to the criticism of Chappelle\u2019s special in a since-deleted Instagram story, writing that the comments seemed \u201cto be about the take, and very little about the actual art.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just \u201cthe take\u201d that people took issue with, though, but the pattern Chappelle has recently displayed of punching down at this specific community. In a July review of his Broadway show, the New York Times noted that after taking flak for mocking trans people in past sets, he \u201cseems to have become fixated on the subject.\u201d\n\nPlaced in context, Che\u2019s misgendering and deadnaming of a trans woman \u2014 which, to be clear, is what most people have taken issue with, as Jenner has been the subject of other edgy jokes in the past \u2014 represents SNL\u2019s latest misstep in joking about gender identity. Any show that has aired for multiple decades is bound to fumble at times, whether due to changing social norms or the sheer volume of material put out. But SNL has grown since the days of, say, Julia Sweeney\u2019s Pat, an androgynous character introduced in the early 1990s whose comedic value came from other characters\u2019 inability to determine Pat\u2019s gender. (In 2017, \u201cTransparent\u201d creator Jill Soloway referred to \u201cIt\u2019s Pat\u201d as a \u201chateful, awful thing to do to nonbinary people.\u201d)\n\nThis might explain the uproar after, as recently as November 2016, just days after the election, \u201cWeekend Update\u201d co-anchor Colin Jost jokingly blamed those who support trans and nonbinary people for the result: \u201cThe dating app Tinder announced a new feature this week which gives users 37 different gender identity options,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018Why Democrats lost the election.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFive years prior, a sketch called \u201cOnce Daily Estro-maxx,\u201d which spoofed pharmaceutical commercials and featured male-identifying cast members in drag as trans women, angered GLAAD enough for the LGBTQ advocacy organization to issue an online petition asking NBC to apologize for the segment. Others argued that the segment parodied drug advertisement tropes more than it did trans people.\n\nSNL has more successfully addressed gender identity in other cases. Take the viral 2015 sketch \u201cA Thanksgiving Miracle,\u201d in which the only thing that can keep a family from fighting at dinner is the act of singing Adele\u2019s \u201cHello.\u201d Upon sitting down at the table, the grandparents mention that they saw trans people at the airport. \u201cVery interesting trend, this,\u201d says the grandfather, played by episode host Matthew McConaughey, to which Jay Pharoah\u2019s character responds, \u201cTransgender is not a trend, Mr. Paul.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any around when I was younger,\u201d the grandfather claims. Cecily Strong\u2019s character snaps, \u201cYeah, they were there, but they couldn\u2019t say anything, so they lived sad lives and died.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a frank statement, but one that, unlike Che\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d joke, leans in favor of trans visibility. If social media is any indication, many at-home viewers were as disappointed as the studio audience over the reference to Jenner, calling it \u201chacky, lame\u201d and, in several cases, transphobic. Some Twitter users also delivered what, for Che, might be the ultimate creative blow: calling the bit \u201cunfunny.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The joke fell flat with the studio audience and immediately sparked backlash online.", "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YbrW1_9hJdO_WqmpoN-RMayVk8Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2MQFYOE6L5E55NEFLXE3Y2RPJM.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
