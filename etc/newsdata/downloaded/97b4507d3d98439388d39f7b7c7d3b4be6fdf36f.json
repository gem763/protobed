But, as any Hollywood executive can tell you, he\u2019s entering a dangerous line of work that often backfires.\n\nInsult comedy is a tried-and-true genre that can provide a valuable social function. Even in less politically correct times, it\u2019s hard work to stay inside the accepted customs of daily living.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWe know we have to, in order to get along at home and to get ahead at work \u2026 But everyone, since childhood, also experiences the secret thrill that comes with breaking the rules \u2014 like sticking your hand in the cookie jar when mom told you not to. It\u2019s a way of asserting yourself, especially in a society like ours that places a premium on individuality.\n\nThat\u2019s where insult comedy comes in: A dark night club is a safe place to experience the titillation of seeing someone else step over the line, saying all those things you know you can\u2019t say if you want to remain a member-in-good-standing among friends and family.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of what Trump is doing at his rallies \u2014 and he knows it. He plays to the audience like the notorious Andrew Dice Clay at his height, riffing the way Don Rickles once did in top Las Vegas rooms during his Rat Pack-era glory days. As cameras pan a Trump venue, you can sense that half the crowd is there for the pure entertainment value of watching him shatter acceptable behavior and simply not care.\n\nThat can be electrifying. But it also can be a difficult, dangerous way to get attention.\n\nInsult comics face enormous pressure to keep ratcheting up the noise level or risk becoming irrelevant. If your entire act is based on breaking rules, then the transgressions need to get more and more outrageous to keep people shocked.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThink of Rickles in his later years, when he had become a beloved comedy legend: People in the audience begged him to make fun of them; it was something to be proud of, a moment to share with everyone you knew. The sting was gone.\n\nTrump is fully aware of this. That\u2019s what sparked his infamous Minneapolis performance, cresting with a Biden zinger about kissing Obama\u2019s backside. The crowd roared and Trump soaked up the reaction like a seasoned comic enjoying his best \u201cdrop the mike\u201d moment.\n\nBut how does he outdo that \u2014 and when he does, what happens? The frightening dilemma insult comics face, as the jokes get harsher, is that some people forget it\u2019s all an act. They think it\u2019s a call to action.\n\nThat reaction is even more alarming when you aren\u2019t actually a comedian but, say, the president of the United States.\n\n\u201cShifty Schiff\u201d may be a cute use of alliteration. But the joke wears thin when Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffWhite House staggers after tumultuous 48 hours Trump embarks on Twitter spree amid impeachment inquiry, Syria outrage House Republicans 'demand the release of the rules' on impeachment MORE (D-Calif.), head of the House committee leading the impeachment inquiry, starts receiving death threats. Barking at the \u201cfake news\u201d media always gets a laugh \u2014 until someone sends bomb threats to CNN or creates a \u201chumorous\u201d video of the president leading a bloody anti-media massacre.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMost comedians and shock jocks, like Clay and Trump-favorite Howard Stern, eventually move on from pure insult. Clay essentially was forced to stop his act when it went too far \u2014 but he now earns accolades for nice-guy supporting roles in hit movies like \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201d Stern these days displays a more sympathetic, self-aware persona, the result of years in therapy and coping with a cancer scare.\n\nBut Stern doesn\u2019t expect his old friend to dial back. \u201cI feel that Donald is caught up in getting the love of the masses,\u201d he told Rolling Stone magazine. \u201cWhich is unobtainable and leads to no good.\u201d\n\nEvery entertainer knows it\u2019s hard to step out of the limelight \u2014 too many do whatever it takes to keep the applause coming. Trump has more rallies lined up, right until Election Day 2020. Along the way, voters will find out just how far he\u2019s willing to go to stay on top.\n\nJoe Ferullo is an award-winning media executive, producer and journalist and former executive vice president of programming for CBS Television Distribution.
