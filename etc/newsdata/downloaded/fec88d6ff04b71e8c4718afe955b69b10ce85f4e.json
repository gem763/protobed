Shocking refereeing.'\n\nAnother Orient fan slammed: 'That's ridiculous from the ref, sack him', while another tweeted: 'Thought we'd left crap refs behind.'\n\nAnd finally, one fan said: 'I'm in shock what on earth have I just seen. The referee should have every single qualification or license he has taken away, that is without doubt one of THE WORST footballing decisions ever.'\n\nThis fan called for the referee to be sacked during the League Two encounter on Tuesday\n\nThe frustration kept flooding in on Twitter following the hugely controversial opener", "description": "Plymouth thrashed Orient 4-0 during the League Two encounter at Home Park but the hosts' opening goal was met by somewhat more than a hint of controversy.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/13/20082120-0-image-a-48_1571832162291.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
