I really do think that. I don\u2019t see a way in for him at the moment.\n\n\u201cFifty-eight million, a lot of money to spend and it would be interesting to ask Frank now if he would sign him at this moment in time if he hadn\u2019t signed him before? The answer to that, I think, is pretty obvious \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBut, there\u2019s a reason Chelsea spent the money on him, he\u2019s still a young man and got enormous talent, he has to go out and show it. It\u2019s good for Frank in terms of strength in depth.\u201d\n\nPulisic has been restricted to just seven appearances so far and only three Premier League starts.\n\nHe did come back into favour for a trip to Southampton on Sunday and offered Lampard a reminder of his talent, with an assist provided for Michy Batshuayi after stepping off the bench to wrap up a 4-1 win at St Mary\u2019s.", "description": "The ex-Blues striker feels a highly-rated playmaker struggling for game time at Stamford Bridge faces a battle to find the minutes he craves and needs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RkaGHbC6p2JA6LcPFMEeeQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bVCEBYYFL6ho4KZfxWJyfQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/90aee1d9587e7287573d0dc87ca874f3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
