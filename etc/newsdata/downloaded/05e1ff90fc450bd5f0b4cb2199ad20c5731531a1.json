The clubs felt that, in a difficult situation, this approach maintains fairness for all members and upholds the principle of the football pyramid.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the clubs have backed the proposed appointment of former Liverpool and Premier League chief executive Rick Parry as the new EFL chairman.
