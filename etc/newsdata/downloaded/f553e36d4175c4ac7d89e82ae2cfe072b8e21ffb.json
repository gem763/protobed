We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nStory Highlights Diablo winds are fueling the Kincade Fire, now raging in California's wine country.\n\nDiablo winds originate hundreds of miles inland in the desert regions of the Great Basin.\n\nFall is the most dangerous time for Diablo winds.\n\nJust as southern California has its notorious Santa Ana winds, northern California's most infamous winds are known as \"Diablo\" winds. These are the winds that are fueling the Kincade Fire, now raging in California's wine country.\n\nBut what are they?\n\nLike Santa Ana winds, Diablo winds originate hundreds of miles inland in the desert regions of the Great Basin, according to the Los Angeles Times. There, circulation of air around a strong area of surface high atmospheric pressure flows over the Sierra Nevada, heading toward lower pressure at sea level.\n\nThe resulting flow from high pressure inland to lower pressure off the California coast is warmed and dried by compressional heating as the air sinks from the Great Basin, which is 4,000 to 5,000 feet in elevation, down to sea level, according to meteorologist Jan Null of Golden Gate Weather Services.\n\nFirefighters survey Soda Rock Winery as it begins to burn during the Kincade fire in Healdsburg, California, on Oct. 27, 2019.

The winds will \"generate critical fire weather conditions when combined with very low humidity,\" the weather service said.\n\nLatest news from the fire zone: Earthquake rattles area near California's Kincade Fire; new blaze by L.A. drives more evacuations\n\nFall is the worst time\n\nThe seasonal timing of Diablo and Santa Ana winds is extremely important in regard to wildfire danger, Null said. One of the chief characteristics of California\u2019s predominantly Mediterranean climate is its extended dry period from about May through October.\n\nConsequently, in the fall, these strong, warm and dry winds occur after months of very little, if any, precipitation and when fuels (such as grasses, shrubs and forests) are at their driest.\n\nWhat about the name?\n\nThe term \u201cDiablo Winds\u201d dates to shortly after the 1991 Tunnel Fire, which devastated a large area of the Oakland and Berkeley hills, according to Null, a former National Weather Service meteorologist.\n\nNull said that \"myself and another forecaster (John Quadros), working at the National Weather Service office in Redwood City (California) at the time, found that after the 1991 fire, calling offshore wind events in the Bay Area as 'the northern California version of Santa Ana winds' was awkward at best, and meteorologically fuzzy at worst.\n\n\"We somehow fell upon the name Diablo Winds as a double entendre, because they generally blow from the direction of Mt. Diablo in the far East Bay, and 'diablo' translates from Spanish as 'devil;' thus, devil winds.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/28/what-are-diablo-winds-kincade-fire-wildfires/2484711001/", "description": "Just as southern California has its notorious Santa Ana winds, northern California's most infamous\u00a0winds are known as \"Diablo\" winds.", "authors": ["Doyle Rice", "Published P.M.
