The biggest concern is the fighting between the two parties. I\u2019m sure he will address this,\u201d she said.\n\nFrancis, who is expected to talk about peace when he meets Mozambique\u2019s leaders on Thursday, mentioned his concern in a video message to the country ahead of the seven-day trip, which will also take him to Madagascar and Mauritius.\n\n\u201cI think he is going to give a forceful message to the country\u2019s leaders about their responsibility to bring about peace and reconciliation, but also about addressing the root causes of the conflict,\u201d said Erica Dahl-Bredine, Mozambique country representative for Catholic Relief Services.\n\nClimate change is expected to be a topic in Mozambique and Madagascar. Deforestation, along with soil erosion, made Mozambique more vulnerable when two cyclones hit the country this year.\n\nFrancis, making his second trip to sub-Saharan Africa, will not be able to visit the city of Beira because of the devastation.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Mozambique has lost 8 million hectares of forest, about the size of Portugal, since the 1970s.\n\nAides say the trip is a key opportunity for the pope to renew appeals enshrined in his 2015 encyclical \u201cLaudato Si\u201d on environmental protection.\n\n\u201cCLIMATE EMERGENCY\u201d\n\nFrancis challenged governments on Sunday to take \u201cdrastic measures\u201d to combat global warming and reduce the use of fossil fuels, saying the world was experiencing a climate emergency.[nL5N25S07P]\n\nIn Madagascar, the world\u2019s fourth-largest island, about 44% of forests have disappeared over the past 60 years, according to the French agricultural research centre CIRAD. The environmental danger there is aggravated because 80% of its plant and animal species are not found anywhere else.\n\nPoverty and corruption will also loom large.\n\nAccording to the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP), 80% of Mozambique\u2019s population of about 30 million cannot afford the minimum costs for an adequate diet.\n\nThe WFP says more than 90% of Madagascar\u2019s population of 26 million live on less than $2 a day and that chronic child malnutrition is widespread.\n\nFrancis has called for a fairer distribution of wealth between prosperous and developing countries, and defended the right of countries to control their mineral resources.\n\nHe has branded corruption \u201cone of the most decimating plagues\u201d in society.\n\nMozambique and Madagascar rank in the lowest quarter of Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index.\n\n\u201cCorruption is huge. Many Mozambicans have lost faith completely in their political leaders,\u201d said Dahl-Bredine.\n\nFrancis makes an eight-hour stop in Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean that is relatively rich compared Madagascar and Mozambique.\n\nBut anti-poverty campaigners say Mauritius\u2019 tax treaties and financial services industry facilitate tax avoidance, draining desperately-needed revenues from poor countries.", "description": "Pope Francis heads to Mozambique on Wednesday to encourage the country's fragile peace, starting a three-nation African tour where climate change, poverty and corruption will also be high on the agenda.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426055354&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830JF-OZATP"}
