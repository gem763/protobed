For example, some of my projects have even pursued weight and opacity to greater degrees.\u201d\n\nThe weight and opacity Ishigami is referring to are manifest in the house and restaurant he devised in the Yamaguchi prefecture not far from Hiroshima. This labyrinthine underground complex was created by pouring concrete into holes in the ground, which acted as a semi-porous mould. The surrounding earth was then excavated to reveal a globular matrix of grotto-like spaces.\n\nJunya Ishigami's Japanese Pavilion in the Giardini della Biennale in Venice.\n\n\u201cIn order to realise experimental construction, a space may deviate from the general values we understand to represent \u2018architecture\u2019,\u201d says Ishigami. \u201cHowever, if there is no comfort then there is no architecture. In that sense, in order to realise experimental construction, a primary need must be to pursue innovation and meet comfort anew.\u201d\n\nOdile Decq, whilst inhabiting another point on the creative spectrum, agrees on the importance of comfort \u2013 even when devising uncompromising architectural gestures.\n\n\u201cArchitecture is about creating contexts within which people can forget about the harshness of their lives outside,\u201d she says. \u201cNo matter how bold, it has to have a humanistic approach, whether housing or offices or a public structure.\u201d\n\nOdile Decq's GL Events building in Lyon appears gauzy thanks to a photographic cladding. Roland Halbe\n\nIn Decq\u2019s deft hands, form doesn\u2019t slavishly follow function.\n\n\u201cThere always has to be something in addition to the functional program in order to provide people with something better, more comfortable, more engaging.\u201d\n\nHer buildings are at once industrial, tough, but strangely effervescent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor all its robust I-Beam structural composition, Decq\u2019s GL Event building in Lyon is virtually transparent, almost gauzy \u2013 its entire facade is covered by ethereal black and white photographs by Swiss artist Felice Varini.\n\nThe recently opened Le Cargo building for business startups, on the north-eastern outskirts of Paris, features a four-storey parapet which appears to bubble up the fa\u00e7ade. An oversized, globular red volume floats above the reception area, creating a dramatic mezzanine. (Black and white offset by red are an identifiable Decq palette.)\n\nOdile Decq is both architect and educator. Franck Juery\n\nDecq, who has been a practising architect for some 40 years and an educator for 20, recently set up her own school to combat the conservatism and sexism of the architecture system. With 35 students from around the world \u2013 \u201c60 percent male to 40 percent female, we\u2019re not there yet\u201d \u2013 Confluence holds no courses but teaches students to research, analyse and express opinions. \u201cThen we repeat the process each semester for five years until they know how to do it by themselves,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cSometimes it feels like a crazy undertaking, but I was tired of always having the same conversations about how the profession is broken,\u201d she says, \u201cso I decided to do something about it instead of just talk.\u201d\n\nSou Fujimoto, who is a member of the advisory board at Confluence, is also a professor of architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. Open-ended, porous, sometimes vitally wall-less, his buildings manifest new ways of being in the city.\n\nThe installation by Junya Ishigami in London's Kensington Gardens.\n\nFujimoto designed the Serpentine Summer Pavilion in 2013, creating an ethereal, cloud-like structure from a white lattice of steel poles. Ishigami\u2019s Serpentine Pavilion \u2013 a swooping wing composed of 61 tonnes of Cumbrian slate \u2013 is installed in Kensington Gardens until next Monday, six days before he delivers his keynote address as part of SCCI\u2019s 2019 Architecture Hub.\n\nDr Gene Sherman (the doctorate is in early 20th-century French literature) launched the SCCI think tank last year with a focus on architecture and fashion. (The next Fashion Hub will take place next April.) This trio of keynote speakers was selected by herself and two advisory curators for various reasons.\n\n\u201cI am attracted to the combination of playfulness and precision in Fujimoto-san\u2019s work,\u201d says Sherman.\n\n\u201cIshigami is a poet at heart and a deeply imaginative artist.\u201d\n\nDecq, Sherman notes, is a trail-blazing female architect in a profession where women rarely rise to the top.\n\n\u201cHer vision is clear, idiosyncratic and opinionated. She has chosen provocation as a stance rather than conciliation or compromise,\u201d says Sherman.\n\nNEED TO KNOW\n\nSCCI Architecture Hub features 50 thinkers in architecture. The 10-day program will be held at various venues across Sydney from October 10.", "description": "Three keynote speakers at next week\u2019s Architecture Hub share a common purpose: coexistence with the landscape.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2119%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a4940ca219c0027e9bcb60d3d7c08a8e1964c4b3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
