It's more like \u201cfight to live another day.\u201d There's too many imponderable permutations and sequels in Britain's tortuous path to leave the European Union.\n\nWhen Boris Johnson took over Downing Street in July, he blustered about taking Britain out of the EU by an October 31 deadline. No ifs, no buts. Just do it. He said \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d the United Kingdom was leaving the bloc. The prospect of a crash-out, no-deal \u201chard Brexit\u201d loomed.\n\nBut bumptious Boris has rowed back considerably. He is putting a draft deal hatched this week with the EU to a vote today in the British Parliament in an extraordinary weekend sitting. Johnson's departure arrangement with Brussels marks a significant climbdown.\n\nHe's no longer telling the EU \u201cto go whistle.\u201d His proposal, which Brussels has signed off on, concedes aligning Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland under EU customs regulations. That avoids the return of a physical border on the island of Ireland, which would have been politically explosive to the peace process in that country with a recent legacy of conflict.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Britain now wants to remain\u2019: Anti-Brexit campaigners\u2019 POWERFUL VIDEO set in English countryside goes viral\n\nIn that way, Johnson's draft deal is not too dissimilar to that of his predecessor Theresa May, who also sought to avoid an Irish border with her \u201cbackstop\u201d formula. The net result is that Ireland will, in practice, be in economic unity, while customs controls for maintaining the EU's single market will be drawn between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nIt's another high-wire act for Johnson's cabinet to get the latest Brexit episode past parliament. This prime minister's record of success is dismal, having been defeated several times already in House of Commons votes.\n\nJohnson's Conservative government is betting on a long shot in a topsy-turvy numbers game. With 287 Tory MPs, he doesn't have an outright parliamentary majority since he kicked out 21 rebel MPs who defied him in a vote last month. That means to get his draft Brexit deal through, he needs those renegade lawmakers to come back into the party fold. With such bad blood, that's far from certain.\n\nEven if the Tory rebels forgive Johnson, that's still not enough to get over the line of a 320-vote majority. Johnson will require some opposition MPs from Labour, Lib-Dems, Scottish Nationalist Party and others to join his ranks to vote Yes. The opposition parties have said they don't approve of the latest deal. So, Johnson is going to have to rely on a handful of rebels within Labour to back him.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Mr Brexit\u2019 Farage says \u2018no\u2019 to Brexit right now & calls for extension and election after rejecting BoJo\u2019s deal\n\nWithout a deal being passed in parliament, the hapless Johnson will be obliged to seek a three-month extension from the EU for more negotiations. A new law passed last month by the British Parliament forbids a no-deal Brexit. If Johnson decides to crash out, he could then be embroiled in a court battle for defying the law. That's unlikely because he has recently cast off his previous gung-ho attitude to seek a deal with other EU leaders. In the event of another parliamentary defeat, Britain's ongoing political impasse over Brexit will probably trigger a snap general election. That's another whirl of the Brexit wheel of fortune, or misfortune.\n\nIf a deal somehow squeezes through parliament this weekend, Britain will be able to officially leave the EU by October 31. But the departure is still subject to more years of negotiating the transition for trade and regulations between Britain and Brussels.\n\nThe exceptional status being bestowed on Northern Ireland is unknown regulatory territory. It's unclear how the new regulatory border between the British mainland and the island of Ireland will work in practice with controls and checks being imposed on trade trafficking across the Irish Sea.\n\nAlso on rt.com Closing the Brexit curtains: It's either Boris' Deal or No Deal\n\nBut the crucial deal-breaker for Johnson lies with the small Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) from Northern Ireland. The Conservative Party has traditionally relied on the unionists to help pass legislation in the Westminster parliament by voting with the London government. In the current parliament, the Tory government's precarious majority has made it even more reliant on the DUP votes. Currently, the DUP has 10 MPs. Johnson needs them to vote for his deal otherwise it won't pass. The DUP thus wields a de facto veto over Brexit proceeding. However, the party has adamantly stated this week that it will not support Johnson's draft deal, which they view as a betrayal. They perceive the proposed Brexit arrangement as a diminution of Northern Ireland's status as part of the United Kingdom. In practical economic terms, the two Irish states are moving towards a united coexistence. To avoid that outcome, the DUP are willing to vote down Johnson's deal which will inevitably throw the Brexit process into even more tortuous uncertainty.\n\nA possible \u201cunited Ireland\u201d has always been the b\u00eate noire for hardline pro-British unionists in Northern Ireland over the past century and more. Their constituency is a minority in Ireland as a whole. Most people in Northern Ireland voted to remain within the EU during the 2016 referendum on Brexit. Yet here we have die-hard unionists effectively pushing for a Brexit in the hardest terms.\n\nAlso on rt.com Like a \u2018greased piglet\u2019 BoJo will win his Brexit vote \u2013 former UK PM Cameron\n\nHistorically, it was the Conservative Party that fomented the cause of unionism in Ireland. More than a century ago, Tory leaders like Winston Churchill and Bonar Law coaxed unionists based mainly in the north of the country \u2013 through centuries of British colonization \u2013 into armed insurrection in order to defy a majority Irish population demanding full independence from Britain. That led to the eventual partition of Ireland in 1920-22 into a small northern state dominated by unionists under British jurisdiction and a nominally independent southern Irish state. It was classic gerrymandering by Britain to create the \u201cdemocratic\u201d mandates it required to continue interfering in Irish national affairs.\n\nUnionism in Northern Ireland \u2013 a minority constituency in Ireland as a whole but then a majority in the partitioned northern state \u2013 was cynically used by the British establishment to wield a veto over Ireland's democratic rights and national sovereignty.Ironically, the intransigent unionists have now ended up holding Britain's politics hostage with their defiance over Brexit. It all comes down to the fact that Britain's never-ending Brexit debacle stems in large part from past and ongoing British violation of democracy in Ireland. Britain's establishment is reaping what it sowed.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
