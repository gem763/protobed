But since the 1970s, California was given permission to set its own rules because it has the most cars on the road of any state and struggles to meet air quality standards.\n\n\"The Oval Office is really not a place for on-the-job training. President Trump should have at least read the instruction manual he inherited when he assumed the presidency, in particular the chapter on respecting the rule of law,\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who sued the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration a day after the regulation was unveiled.\n\nThe decision was intended to block the state from working with automakers to keep the market standard for automobile emissions stricter than the Trump administration's rules. Those rules, however, will let manufacturers \"produce far less expensive cars for the consumer, while at the same time making the cars substantially SAFER,\" Trump tweeted Wednesday. \"This will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety advantage, and also due to the fact that older, highly polluting cars, will be replaced by new, extremely environmentally friendly cars.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe changes won\u2019t take effect for another 60 days, giving state officials time to prepare a lawsuit. But the litigation will be complex and could last for years.\n\nIn the meantime, California regulators in charge of reducing pollutants are considering toughening limits on refinery emissions and imposing \u201croadway pricing\u201d \u2014 which includes charging higher tolls during rush hour in the hopes of keeping cars off the road.\n\nThe Trump administration's decision does not just affect California. Thirteen other states, plus the District of Columbia, have adopted California's emission rules for cars and trucks. States joining California in the lawsuit are attorneys general from: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe cities of New York and Los Angeles also joined the lawsuit.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.", "description": "A group of 23 states, including California, are suing to block the determination by the U.S. Transportation Department and its\u00a0National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u00a0that federal law bars California from setting stricter rules.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/california-emissions-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
