The index had rebounded in August from July's negative 12. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a reading of zero for the September period.\n\nPositive readings signal expansion, while negative readings indicate contraction.\n\nFirms reported a decrease in backlog of orders, the index for which dropped to negative 11 from negative 9 in August, as well as weakening local business conditions but were optimistic of improvement in coming months, according to the report. The measure of local business conditions slid to negative -15 from -3 in August.\n\nThe volume of new orders declined to negative 14 in September from 2 in August. Manufacturing shipments fell to negative 14 in September from 5 in August.
