They were awarded $5000 or Rs 3,50,000 for their innovation.\n\nThe team included Siddama Tigadi, Siddamma Tigadi, Ganesh Kadam, Sangeetha Nair and Shreyas Kulkarni (from left to right)\n\nYoutube/Purva Suchak\n\nIndia has various low-lying areas close to dams or water bodies that are in constant danger of being flooded upon extensive rain, resulting in rise of water levels.\n\nDon't Miss 44.1 K SHARES 6.9 K SHARES 5.1 K SHARES 1.6 K SHARES 903 SHARES\n\nTeam working on Purva Suchak have taken help of IBM services like Watson IoT, AI, Weather Data API as well as Blockchain. Purva Suchak constantly checks reservoirs, dams and bodies of water with the help of sensors (thus applying IoT) and keeps a track of its levels (with the help of AI-based water-body monitoring that is done through images captured using a drone).\n\nAll this data (stored on blockchain) is then sent to an AI application which predicts the rise of water levels and any immediate actions if necessary.\n\nReuters\n\nIt also simultaneously collects weather forecast information that helps them to make effective flood prediction data which is also stored on blockchain. This data can be shared by anyone who needs the data including, government agencies and disaster management teams, NGOs etc.\n\nThe reason they've used blockchain for this is because it offers data integrity and secure sharing of information, preventing tampering.\n\nAnother Indian-origin team helping simplify lives of people affected by disasters is Sparrow, who won the first runner-up position at the Call for Code 2019 with a cash prize of $25,000 (approximately Rs 17,73,250). The team also included people from the US and China.\n\nIBM\n\nThe Sparrow as a platform is a split into two parts-- the first one connects the victims to all the apps across the globe to aid in disaster management, whereas the second one is a section where victims can connect with doctors online to tackle health-related issues during disasters.\n\nThe app is designed to work even without network or internet. Sparrow converts a smartphone into a mobile tower, and other people's smartphones that are close to it are turned into mobile towers, allowing for communication with the people nearby-- creating a sort of mesh network.\n\nEventually the messages in these disconnected areas reach smartphones that are within the range of internet and then the messages reach the rest of the world.", "description": "Two Indian origin teams bagged awards for their innovative solutions to disaster management to help not just the victims but also government bodies and disaster management teams to get in touch with the victims promptly and safely.
