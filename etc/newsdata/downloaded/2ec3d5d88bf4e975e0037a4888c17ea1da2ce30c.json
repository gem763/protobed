And slowly people are becoming more and more adventurous,\" Abdilahi Hassan, the co-owner and manager, said. \"It's the best time for us to open a Somali restaurant because people are really appreciative of the Somali community here in Columbus.\"\n\nJanet Weinstein/ABC News\n\nColumbus\u2019 Somalian community is the second-largest in the U.S., only behind Minneapolis. Hoyo\u2019s Kitchen opened its first location in Westerville, Ohio, a Columbus suburb, almost five years ago with the aim of becoming a \"window to the continent of Africa.\"\n\n\"It's our duty as a Somali community to bridge those gaps and to educate people on who we are and where we come from,\" Hassan said.\n\n\"Hoyo\" translates to \"mother\" in Somali, and Hassan opened the family-run restaurant with the goal of paying homage to his mother by cooking with her recipes. He is a first-generation American, and his parents immigrated to the U.S. more than 20 years ago.\n\nJanet Weinstein/ABC News\n\nAlthough anti-immigrant rhetoric has increased on a national scale, Hassan said he hasn\u2019t \"seen anything negative\" from people in central Ohio.\n\n\"Everyone represents themselves and your job is to represent yourself and ultimately your community the best you can,\" he added.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
