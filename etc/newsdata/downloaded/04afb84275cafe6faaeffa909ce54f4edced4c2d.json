But he stressed that military retaliation was not yet on the table in response to the strike against a key U.S. Mideast ally.\n\nOil prices soared worldwide amid the damage in Saudi Arabia and fresh Middle East war concerns. But Trump put the brakes on any talk of quick military action \u2014 earlier he had said the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d \u2014 and he said the oil impact would not be significant on the U.S., which is a net energy exporter.\n\nThe Saudi government called the attack an \u201cunprecedented act of aggression and sabotage\u201d but stopped short of directly pinning blame on Iran.\n\nIran denied involvement.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Pompeo said Saturday, \u201cIran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d\n\nTrump, too, had talked more harshly at first. But by Monday afternoon he seemed intent on consultations with allies.\n\n\u201cThat was an attack on Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an attack on us, but we would certainly help them,\u201d he said, noting a decades-long alliance linked to U.S. oil dependence that has lessened in recent years. The U.S. has no treaty obligation to defend Saudi Arabia.\n\nTrump said he was sending Pompeo to Saudi Arabia \u201cto discuss what they feel\u201d about the attack and an appropriate response.\n\nOne U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the U.S. was considering dispatching additional military resources to the Gulf but that no decisions had been made. The U.S. already has the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier battle group in the area, as well as fighter jets, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and air defenses.\n\nTrump, alternating between aggressive and nonviolent reactions, said the U.S. could respond \u201cwith an attack many, many times larger\u201d but also \u201cI\u2019m not looking at options right now.\u201d\n\nAmerican officials released satellite images of the damage at the heart of the kingdom\u2019s crucial Abqaiq oil processing plant and a key oil field, and two U.S. officials said the attackers used multiple cruise missiles and drone aircraft.\n\nPrivate experts said the satellite images show the attackers had detailed knowledge of which tanks and machinery to hit within the sprawling Saudi oil processing facility at Abqaiq to cripple production. But \u201csatellite imagery can\u2019t show you where the attack originated from,\u201d said Joe Bermudez, an expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who examined the images.\n\n\u201cWhat the photos indicate is that someone planned a sophisticated, coordinated attack that really impacted the production of oil at this facility,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. alleges the pattern of destruction suggested Saturday\u2019s attack did not come from neighboring Yemen, as claimed by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels there. A Saudi military alleged \u201cIranian weapons\u201d had been used.\n\nThe Saudis invited United Nations and other international experts to help investigate, suggesting there was no rush to retaliate.\n\nJon Alterman, the chief Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Saudi caution reflects the kingdom\u2019s wariness of taking on Iran.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a great independent Saudi capability to respond,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to start a war with Iran that you don\u2019t have an idea how you\u2019re going to end.\u201d\n\nIn New York, the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, condemned the attack and said that \u201cemerging information indicates that responsibility lies with Iran.\u201d\n\nAt the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Mark Esper suggested Iranian involvement, too. In a series of tweets after meeting with Trump and other senior national security officials, Esper said the administration was working with partner nations \u201cto address this unprecedented attack and defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran.\u201d\n\nIran rejected the allegations, and a government spokesman said there now is \u201cabsolutely no chance\u201d of a hoped-for meeting between Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Trump at the U.N. General Assembly next week.\n\n\u201cCurrently we don\u2019t see any sign from the Americans which has honesty in it, and if the current state continues there will be absolutely no chance of a meeting between the two presidents,\u201d spokesman Ali Rabiei said.\n\nDownplaying any talk of imminent U.S. military action, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, told reporters at the White House that Trump\u2019s \u201clocked and loaded\u201d was \u201ca broad term that talks about the realities that\u201d the U.S. is \u201csafer and more secure domestically from energy independence.\u201d\n\nThe new violence has led to fears that further action on any side could rapidly escalate a confrontation that\u2019s been raging just below the surface in the wider Persian Gulf in recent months. There already have been mysterious attacks on oil tankers that Washington blames on Tehran, at least one suspected Israeli strike on Shiite forces in Iraq, and the downing of a U.S. military surveillance drone by Iran.\n\nThose tensions have increased ever since Trump pulled the U.S. out of Iran\u2019s 2015 agreement with world powers that curtailed Iranian nuclear activities and the U.S. re-imposed sanctions that sent Iran\u2019s economy into freefall.\n\nThe weekend attack halted production of 5.7 million barrels of crude a day, more than half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s global daily exports and more than 5% of the world\u2019s daily crude oil production.\n\nThe U.S. and international benchmarks for crude each vaulted more than 14%, comparable to the 14.5% spike in oil on Aug. 6, 1990, following Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait.\n\nU.S. stocks were down but only modestly. Major stock indexes in Europe also fell. Markets in Asia finished mixed.\n\nAt a news conference, Saudi military spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki said, \u201cAll the indications and operational evidence, and the weapons that were used in the terrorist attack, whether in Buqayq or Khurais, indicate with initial evidence that these weapons are Iranian weapons.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry, while expressing \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the attack, warned against putting the blame on Iran, saying that plans of military retaliation against Iran would be unacceptable.\n\n___\n\nAP Writers Jon Gambrell and Aya Batrawy contributed from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
