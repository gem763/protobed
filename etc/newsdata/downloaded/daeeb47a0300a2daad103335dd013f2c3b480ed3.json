REUTERS/Baz Ratner/File Photo\n\nThe death in neighbouring Uganda of a 9-year-old girl who had tested positive for the virus after entering the country from Congo underscored the challenge medical teams face containing the disease in border territory with a highly mobile population.\n\nThe government team overseeing the response said the number of confirmed and probable cases had also hit a milestone of more than 3,000 in what has become the second-worst epidemic of the virus on record.\n\nDespite the development of an effective vaccine and treatments, health workers have struggled to stop the virus spreading in remote and conflict-hit areas of eastern Congo, where many locals are wary of the response effort.\n\nNevertheless, the World Health Organization said the latest Uganda case highlighted the border authorities\u2019 skill at detecting and isolating potential sources of transmission.\n\n\u201cThis case was picked up at the border,\u201d WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said at a briefing in Geneva. \u201cThe people who are at the borders have the expertise.\u201d\n\nThis is Congo\u2019s 10th Ebola outbreak, but it is the first in the densely forested hillside provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, where militia-led violence and ethnic killing have undermined security in certain areas for decades.\n\nThe WHO declared the epidemic an international health emergency in July - only the fifth outbreak to warrant this status since the system was introduced in 2005.\n\nThe authorities have since come up against new fronts in their fight to contain the virus, testing the reach and flexibility of responders.\n\nHealth workers confirmed the first cases in South Kivu province on Aug. 16. Soon after, a woman contracted the virus in a remote, militia-controlled territory in North Kivu, hundreds of kilometres away from other known cases.\n\n\u201cThe response is being spread too thin chasing new cases at the expense of the longer-term community engagement that is crucial if we\u2019re ever to hope of being Ebola free,\u201d Oxfam\u2019s Congo Director Corinne N\u2019Daw said in a statement.\n\nDespite the virus spreading to new areas, the past week\u2019s transmission rate was little changed from that of the past month and a half, which has seen an average of 77 new cases per week, according to the WHO.\n\nLast week the WHO voiced concern about the widening geographic reach of the disease, but confirmed the virus had not gained a foothold in the major city of Goma, even after four cases were recorded there in July and early August.\n\nGoma, a lakeside city of nearly 2 million people on the Rwandan border, had been on high alert for weeks after a gold miner with a large family infected several people with Ebola before dying himself.\n\nThe latest government data showed Ebola deaths reaching 2,006 and cases at 3,004.\n\n\u201cTwo thousand deaths means that there is a problem,\u201d said Timoth\u00e9e Buliga, a priest, returning home from his church in Goma. \u201cWe need to reach the point where we reject Ebola, say no and eradicate it definitively.\u201d\n\nOnly the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been deadlier than the current outbreak. More than 11,300 people died then out of the 28,000 who were infected.", "description": "The death toll from Democratic Republic of Congo's year-long Ebola outbreak has climbed above 2,000, government data showed on Friday, as responders battle to overcome community mistrust and widespread security problems.", "authors": ["Djaffar Al Katanty", "Aaron Ross", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424316583&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7T0GQ-OZATP"}
