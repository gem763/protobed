In the 21st century, however, the process is usually subtler.\n\nAuthoritarianism is on the march across much of the world, but its advance tends to be relatively quiet and gradual, so that it\u2019s hard to point to a single moment and say, this is the day democracy ended. You just wake up one morning and realize that it\u2019s gone.\n\nIn their 2018 book \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d the political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt documented how this process has played out in many countries, from Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, to Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Turkey, to Viktor Orban\u2019s Hungary. Bit by bit the guardrails of democracy were torn down, as institutions meant to serve the public became tools of the ruling party, then were weaponized to punish and intimidate that party\u2019s opponents. On paper these countries are still democracies; in practice they have become one-party regimes.\n\nAnd the events of the past week have demonstrated how this can happen right here in America.\n\nAt first Sharpiegate, Donald Trump\u2019s inability to admit that he misstated a weather projection by claiming that Alabama was at risk from Hurricane Dorian, was kind of funny, even though it was also scary \u2014 it\u2019s not reassuring when the president of the United States can\u2019t face reality. But it stopped being any kind of joke on Friday, when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a statement falsely backing up Trump\u2019s claim that it had warned about an Alabama threat.", "description": "Sharpies, auto emissions and the weaponization of policy.", "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/opinion/09krugman/09krugman-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
