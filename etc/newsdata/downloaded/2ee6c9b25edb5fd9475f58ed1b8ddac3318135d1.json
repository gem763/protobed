Much to his staff\u2019s alarm, Trump reportedly asked why he couldn\u2019t give Gulen over to \u201cmy friend\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nEvery day, there\u2019s another devastating story or desultory interview that seems to reveal shady foreign interloping on the part of President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. But instead of backing down after the damaging headlines air, Giuliani keeps holding court\u2014and there might actually be a method to his madness.\n\nErdogan wants Gulen because he accuses him of attempting a coup in 2016. Gulen denies any involvement in the putsch and lives in exile in Pennsylvania. There is a good chance he will be left to rot in a prison, if not executed, if he is returned to Turkey.\n\nGiuliani reportedly brought up Gulen so often that a former official called the subject his \u201chobby horse,\u201d while another official described Giuliani\u2019s conversations as \u201call Gulen.\u201d According to the Post, White House aides report that Giuliani seemed to be working on behalf of the Turkish government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat possibility is particularly troubling in light of the fact that Trump\u2019s first disgraced national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had reportedly been offered $15 million to kidnap Gulen and deliver him to Turkey.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s work for Trump is unpaid, and it\u2019s unclear how he makes an income.\n\nBut we know that investigators have been looking into his ongoing paid work for foreign clients (while he\u2019s served as the president\u2019s personal lawyer), including wealthy Ukrainian businessmen and the Mujahidin e-Khalq (MEK), an anti-Iranian militant group that has paid millions to American politicians and celebrities over the years\u2014including Giuliani\u2014to lobby and give speeches on their behalf. Giuliani is credited in part with helping to get the MEK taken off the State Department\u2019s list of world terrorist organizations in 2012.\n\nWrote former ambassador Daniel Benjamin in late 2016:\n\nGiuliani has been speechifying at hyperspeed for years, collecting $11.4 million for 124 appearances in just one year\u2014and that was before signing up for the MeK gravy train around 2011. Perhaps he just didn\u2019t have time to consider the character of his paymaster.\n\nGiuliani is not registered as a foreign agent and claims that he is not working on behalf of Turkey. Or at least that\u2019s what he said on Monday. On Tuesday, he texted the Washington Post that he \u201ccan\u2019t comment on it\u201d because \u201cthat would be complete attorney client privilege but sounds wacky.\u201d\n\nTwo of the men Giuliani was working with on the Ukraine issue were arrested this week as they attempted to leave the country. They are accused of being part of a conspiracy to funnel foreign money into U.S. elections. On Wednesday, the FBI arrested a fourth defendant in the campaign finance case. The FBI and criminal prosecutors in Manhattan are also conducting a counterintelligence probe against Giuliani that has been underway for months.\n\nGiuliani has often gotten ahead of a damaging news cycle by going on TV to spin a different narrative. If he\u2019d gotten wind that he and his associates were under investigation, it may explain some of his more bizarre television antics over the past month.\n\nGiuliani kicked things off by alleging that Hunter Biden had profited from corrupt dealings in the Ukraine. In the ensuing media blitz, he gave a series of contradictory, bizarre, and seemingly unhinged interviews. State Department, Pentagon, and National Security Council officials, as we know now from recent testimony and interviews, were unhappy with Giuliani\u2019s \u201cshadow diplomacy\u201d to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens. They were were angered by his \u201ccircumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nHow did Giuliani respond? He went on TV and implicated them in his schemes. He posted screenshots of text messages he\u2019d exchanged with State Department official Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, that implied the State Department was helping to orchestrate his Ukraine meetings.\n\nThe message seems pretty clear: if Giuliani is going down, he\u2019s taking the whole Trump administration with him.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Giuliani.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
