It is an agreement between the Snakeheads and their customers.\n\n(Image: Humphrey Nemar)\n\n(Image: Peter Macdiarmid/LNP)\n\n\u201cThere is a pride that they get out of Fujian and have a chance of a good life with good money in places like Northern Ireland, England, Scotland where there are good benefits.\n\n\"Yes the journey is difficult, it is uncomfortable and it is frightening, but the gamble is normally worth it. The chances of a good life is worth the risk. In this case it didn\u2019t work. Something went wrong but the Snakeheads will just go again.\n\n\u201cThere will be no tears. In Fujian there is little employment, little money or opportunity, so we get it elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThese customers get paid as little as \u00a3200 a month in China and live in horrible conditions. In the UK, they can get \u00a32,000 a month in a job with no responsibilities, get benefits, get married and live a decent life.\n\n\u201cThese people who died in this container had hopes of a future in a good country. Another group will be waiting for their chance to get on a lorry now somewhere in Europe.\n\n\u201cThis will not put them off. The plan normally works. The Snakeheads have contacts everywhere. They are \u00adpractical people, not emotional. They have lost \u00a31.2million in \u00adearnings in this. So they will go again.\u201d\n\nThe source claimed migrants who make it to the West start paying back the Snakeheads the moment they get a job, over three years. If they cannot pay, the gangs will put pressure on their families back in China to hand over the cash.", "description": "Police are reportedly probing whether some of the 39 Chinese migrant were being sent to work as prostitutes in the UK, along with slave labour jobs in nail salons, massage parlours and restaurants", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Pa", "Skty News", "Humphrey Nemar", "Peter Macdiarmid Lnp"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20721711.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bodies-found-in-lorry-container.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
