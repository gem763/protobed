Irving, dead at 93 | CBC News", "language": "en", "text": "Prominent New Brunswick philanthropist Jean Irving died Tuesday morning.\n\nThe 93-year-old died peacefully at her home in Rothesay, according to Mary Keith, a spokesperson for J.D. Irving Ltd.\n\nIrving will be remembered by many for her contribution to communities and social issues across the province.\n\n\"She was just a great human being,\" said former Saint John mayor Shirley McAlary, now the deputy mayor.\n\nIrving was married to J.K. Irving, chair of J.D.Irving Ltd.\n\n\"Yes, she had the means financially to do whatever she wanted, but she spent a lot of that time and a lot of her resources helping a lot of people,\" McAlary said. \"And not everybody does that when you're in a position like that.\"\n\nShe always 'gave herself'\n\nMcAlary always viewed Irving as a role model. The two women met in the early 1990s and worked on a number of projects together, including the creation of First Steps, a pregnancy centre for young, single mothers.\n\nShe said they renovated and furbished the entire house where the mothers could stay.\n\nIrving always made a point of providing a few extra little touches for each project, such as making sure the young women had a supply of books and magazines to read at the house.\n\nShe was also adamant the entire kitchen be painted in red and should include red countertops and a red table.\n\n\"She felt that red was a colour that would be nice for young women,\" she said. \"I think it's red to this day. I don't think they've changed it at all.\"\n\nMcAlary described Irving as a loyal and enthusiastic person, who was well-connected.\n\n\"She was just so committed and she gave herself. She gave her time.\"\n\nRestored hospital dome\n\nShe also worked on restoring and refurbishing the old Millennium Dome, one of the few remaining relics from the old Saint John General Hospital.\n\nThe dome was part of the Saint John skyline from 1931 until the hospital was demolished in the 1990s. The dome now sits on Garden Street.\n\nThat particular site was selected because it sits near a former boarding house for nurses, which is where she met J.K. Irving.\n\n\"They picked that spot together,\" McAlary said.\n\nThe restoration of the old Millennium Dome, part of the former Saint John General Hospital, was one of the many projects Jean Irving took part in. (Robert Jones/CBC)\n\nIn 2000, Jean and J.K. Irving started PALS, or Partners Assisting Local Schools, at Prince Charles School in Saint John.\n\nThe K-8 school in the core, in what the city calls a priority neighbourhood, is just a few hundred metres from the headquarters of J.D. Irving Ltd.\n\nThe program brings in volunteers to be mentors for the students, including many employees of the company.\n\nHands-on approach\n\nThe principal, Lori Doyle, said Jean Irving always took a hands-on approach at the school.\n\n\"She's dug in gardens, she's planted flowers with kids, she's read with children, she's flipped burgers and she wasn't someone we didn't see.\"\n\nDoyle said Irving also showed a keen interest in what else could be done to help.\n\n\"Just good questions and good insight into learning and children and wanting to do whatever she and Mr. Irving could do to support that.\"\n\nDoyle taught at Prince Charles in the '90s, then left to continue her career. She said coming back showed her how much the program has helped.\n\nLori Doyle, the principal of Prince Charles School in Saint John, looks at a photograph of Jean and J.K. Irving taken during a school event. (Steven Webb/CBC)\n\n\"The difference in this building was palpable, absolutely. \u2026 I could feel it when I came into the building, the difference in having that community piece.\n\n\"Everything we do in education is a puzzle, and that's a huge piece to the puzzle, and that wasn't there when I left but it was when I returned.\"\n\nIrving was born in Petitcodiac and was a mother of four.\n\nShe received the Order of New Brunswick in 2013 for her commitment to \"bettering the quality of life of communities\" across the province.\n\nJ.K. Irving was married to Jean Irving. (Connell Smith/CBC)\n\nIrving was a volunteer Red Cross nursing instructor. She sponsored a swimming program for more than 1,500 children at her summer home in Bouctouche.\n\nShe was the founder of the Netherwood Chapel Kids Club Foundation and played a key role in the creation of Saint John's first autism centre.\n\nShe also contributed her time and effort to Beulah Camp and Caton's Island on the St. John River.\n\n\"Mrs. Irving's generosity was instrumental in creating many parks and playgrounds throughout our province,\" read her description in the Order of New Brunswick.", "description": "Prominent New Brunswick philanthropist Jean Irving has died Tuesday morning.", "authors": ["Reporter Editor", "Elizabeth Fraser Is A Reporter Editor With Cbc New Brunswick Based In Fredericton.
