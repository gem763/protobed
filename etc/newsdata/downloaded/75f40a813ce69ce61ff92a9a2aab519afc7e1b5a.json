You\u2019re essentially a nun, devoted to your religion for that period of time,' she told The New York Post.\n\nAdams, who has not shared her real name, grew up in the Pacific Northwest in what she describes as a small town. She did not specify which state she calls home.\n\nAged 17, she was able to choose which church she wanted to join.\n\nShe had already had sex once, but decided to recommit herself to abstinence once she was formally part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n'The church took me in, was so welcoming, and wanted to do well by me,' she said.\n\nShe then spent 18 months converting then stayed committed to the religion until she had sex again aged 26.\n\nAdams then left the church for good in 2017 after being told that she could not be a bridesmaid in her sister's wedding because the dress she would have to wear was too revealing.\n\n'The problem is not just that premarital sex is denied but that they make it out to be a very serious sin and shameful thing to do.\n\nAdams, 30, said she was 'sexually repressed' for years when she was in the church\n\nAdams worked as a stripper for a time and that is how she came into contact with porn agents\n\n'The deeper I got into the religion, the farther from my own identity I got,' she said.\n\nThe 30-year-old is now on the cover of Penthouse magazine as its 'pet of the month'\n\nShe moved to L.A. with hopes of becoming an actress but struggled to find work and ended up working as a stripper.\n\nIn that job, she was contacted by porn agents.\n\nShe partnered with one in January and is now working in the porn industry. She was named Penthouse magazine's 'Pet of the month' this month.\n\nAdams says that her religious family are supportive of her career.\n\n'I knew that they\u2019d be a little shocked when I told them about my adult work,\u201d she says. 'While they\u2019ve been open-minded about her new career, they\u2019re also averting their eyes.\n\n'My brother said, \"I will definitely never watch your porn, but you seem happier than ever, so I support your decision.\"'", "description": "Addie Adams, 30, joined the church when she was 17 after growing up in\u00a0 a religious household and spent nine years observing its ruled until moving to Los Angeles to try to become an actress.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/20089172-0-image-a-49_1571843843672.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
