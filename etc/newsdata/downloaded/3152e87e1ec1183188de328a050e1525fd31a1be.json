So I can't understand my life without The Godfather or without Dracula,\" said Mexican film director and actor Gael Garcia Bernal.\n\n\"He's a huge director and on top of that, he's a great man in life,\" said French actor Nathalie Baye.\n\nThe Lumi\u00e8re Prize takes its name from the Lumi\u00e8re brothers, Auguste and Louis, who lived in Lyon where they invented the cinematograph, the first motion picture film camera in the 1890s. The festival and its prizes focus on preserving the memory of the world's cinema.\n\nThe Lumi\u00e8re award has been ambitiously described as the Nobel Prize for cinema with previous recipients including Clint Eastwood, Pedro Almodovar, Ken Loach, Milos Forman, Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese.\n\nJust a decade on the festival has established itself as one of the most important, attracting around 185,000 people last year.", "description": "Cult US filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola  has received the prestigious Lumi\u00e8re Award at the Lumi\u00e8re festival, which ends on Sunday in Lyon.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/48/90/1000x563_cmsv2_3d3ff7e2-830e-5b90-99da-3bf48cfc0fe5-4244890.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
