I just adore him.\n\nIn the Seventies, he happily joined in when we gave ourselves drag names: I was Sharon, my manager John Reid was Beryl and Rod was Phyllis.\n\nThen, when the Press started speculating about my hair falling out, he sent me one of those helmet-shaped hairdryers that old women used to sit under in salons. Keen to reciprocate his thoughtfulness, I sent him a Zimmer frame covered in fairy lights.\n\nEven today, if Rod's got an album out that's selling better than mine, I know it's only a matter of time before he emails me: 'Hello, Sharon, just writing to say I'm sorry that your record's not even in the Top 100, dear. What a pity when mine's doing so well. Love, Phyllis.'\n\nPals: Elton and Rod Stewart in 1978\n\nThis kind of thing reached a peak in the Eighties. Rod was playing Earls Court, and the promoters advertised the gig by flying a blimp with his face on it over the venue.\n\nI was staying in London and could see it from my hotel room. It was too good an opportunity to miss. So I called my management, who hired someone to shoot it down: apparently it landed on top of a double-decker bus and was last seen heading towards Putney.\n\nMe: Elton John Official Autobiography by Elton John is published by Macmillan on October 15, \u00a325\n\nAn hour later, the phone went. It was Rod, spluttering: 'Where's my f***ing balloon gone? It was you, wasn't it? You cow! You bitch!' A year later, when I was playing Olympia, the promoters hung a huge banner across the street. It was mysteriously cut down immediately after it was put up.\n\nI learned this had happened from Rod, who seemed curiously well-informed. 'Such a shame about your banner, love. I heard it wasn't even up five minutes. I bet you didn't even get to see it.'\n\nAfter I came out of rehab, I didn't appear on stage for 18 months. But I made an exception for Rod's gig at Wembley Arena. I unexpectedly turned up on stage in full drag, then sat on his lap while he tried to sing You're In My Heart.\n\nI'd been told I shouldn't do any work, I should concentrate on getting well. But spoiling things for Rod has never felt like work, more a thoroughly enjoyable hobby\n\nMe: Elton John Official Autobiography by Elton John is published by Macmillan on October 15, \u00a325. \u00a9 Elton John 2019.\n\nTo order a copy for \u00a312.50 (50 per cent discount) call 01603 648155 or go to mailshop.co.uk\n\nFREE delivery on all orders.
