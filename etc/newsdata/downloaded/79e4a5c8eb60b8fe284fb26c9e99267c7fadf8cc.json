A few of them hurled insults at the activists. One woman shouted, \u201cThe world is not coming to an end!\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion begin their planned disruption of the tube on the Jubilee Line at Canning Town \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd pic.twitter.com/oN8LDO1G0o \u2014 Holly Collins (@HollyJoCollins) October 17, 2019\n\nBut eventually the crowd grew restless\u2014no doubt because most of them were trying to get to work\u2014and forcefully pulled the activists off the train. One of protesters appeared to be kicked and beaten after he was dragged off the train into a throng of bystanders.\n\nThere were similar disruptions at other stations throughout the city, where some activists glued themselves to a train, just as protesters had glued themselves to the ground earlier this week at Trafalgar Square as police tried to clear the area.\n\nExtinction Rebellion vows to \u201cpeacefully occupy the centres of power and shut them down.\u201d The group, which promised similar demonstrations in other cities across the world, began staging Occupy-style protests in London last week, and by Monday more than 1,400 had been arrested. Authorities have issued a blanket ban on Extinction Rebellion protests and on Thursday London Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned the group for disrupting public transportation.\n\nCommuters drag Extinction Rebellion protesters off Tube trains https://t.co/o60kj16B9w pic.twitter.com/c8PFQfWaDg \u2014 ITV London (@itvlondon) October 17, 2019\n\nLet\u2019s Get Realistic About Climate Change\n\nSo far, the protests have been extremely unpopular. A YouGov poll on Thursday found 63 percent sympathized with the commuters who pulled the protesters off the train. Just 13 percent said they support the protesters.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why. Even if one believes in catastrophic man-made climate change and supports policies to limit or reverse it, there\u2019s only so much the average person is going to do. Skipping work to indulge extremists demonstrating on top of a train simply isn\u2019t an option for most people. Neither is going without electricity or forgoing air travel.\n\nIn fact, most people are increasingly of two minds about climate change. On the one hand, they fear it and want something to be done. On the other hand, they\u2019re not willing to do anything extreme. That\u2019s what a recent poll by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation found.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 said climate change is man-made, about half said urgent action is needed, and nearly 4 in 10 said it\u2019s a crisis. At the same time, fewer than 4 in 10 said they were willing to make to make \u201cmajor sacrifices\u201d or pay for it out of their own pockets.\n\nIn that sense, the scene at that train station in London on Thursday morning is really the entire climate change debate in microcosm. When extremist climate change ideology conflicts with the facts of everyday life, like commuters needing to get to work, most people choose the latter.\n\nIf people aren\u2019t willing to give up relatively minor things, they\u2019ll never support the radical emissions cuts and structural changes to the economy espoused by advocates of the Green New Deal like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Maybe that\u2019s because most people know these changes would wreak economic devastation across the world and condemn millions of people to poverty.\n\nConsider the aims of the group behind the London protests. Extinction Rebellion wants the U.K. government to declare a climate emergency, reduce carbon emission to net zero in six years, and form a citizen assembly to oversee the changes. Whether the group will admit it or not, reducing carbon emissions to net zero in six years would devastate the economy of the United Kingdom and plunge it into a pre-industrial dystopia. Simply put, most people aren\u2019t on board with that.\n\nClimate Change Hysteria Is an Insult to Working People\n\nThe visceral reaction of these London commuters exemplified one other aspect of the climate change debate, which is the disdain environmentalist elites have for ordinary people, especially for the world\u2019s poor. The protesters believed, implicitly, that the commuters should suffer what they must for the sake of raising awareness about climate change\u2014and they should have no say in the matter.\n\nHere again, the scene at the train station was the climate change debate in microcosm. Those people were going to get on that train, climate activism be damned. In the same way, people without electricity in China and India and the Middle East will do anything to get it. They don\u2019t care whether it contributes to global carbon emissions, their priority is being able to turn on the lights.\n\nIndeed, the only way to reduce emissions on a scale that will appease climate change ideologues is if poor people stay poor. Not only that, but plenty of working and middle class people will have to become poor, whether they like it or not.\n\nNo wonder they pulled those guys off the train.", "description": "The protesters dragged off the top of a train in London by angry commuters exemplified the disconnect between climate change ideologues and ordinary people.", "authors": ["John Daniel Davidson"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/45872719192_badf5cebbb_k.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
