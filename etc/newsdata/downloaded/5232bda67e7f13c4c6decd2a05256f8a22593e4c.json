The Hong Kong protests began as a pushback against Beijing's proposed extradition law but have grown into calls for American-style elections on the island province of China.\n\nBlizzard banned Ng Wai Chung, who plays under the name \"Blitzchung\" from competing for a year and stripped him of any prize money he had coming in the 2019 Hearthstone Grandmasters Official Competition. Blitzchung typically earns between $500 and $3,000 per tournament.\n\nBlitzchung ended an interview by donning a mask and saying \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!\"\n\nBlizzard used its discretion to determine that Blitzchung's actions had brought him \"into public disrepute,\" offended \"a portion or group of the public,\" or otherwise damaged Blizzard's image, according to Kotaku.com.\n\nThe gaming company's move was met with harsh criticism online.

I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life.\u201d\n\nBlitzchung is from Hong Kong where protesters routinely hide their faces and conceal their identities for fear of reprisal from the Chinese communists on the mainland.\n\nBlizzard joins the NBA, Tiffany's, Mariott and a raft of airlines in bowing to China's demands by curbing their speech.", "description": "The gaming company's move was met with harsh criticism online.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/hearthstone-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
