(Image: Jace Downs, AMC)\n\nIt\u2019s the question that philosophers in the zombie apocalypse have asked for ages: What makes a person cut off the face of a corpse and wear it as a mask in order to hang out with dozens, if not hundreds, of the dead? We have our answer, and it\u2019s very, very Walking Dead.\n\nMuch as in the second episode of the second half of season nine, \u201cWe Are the End of the World\u201d wants to give more background to the zany new threat faced by the colonies in the present. But while \u201cOmega\u201d examined the moment that Alpha went from being part of civilisation to abandoning it, this episode focuses on the first meeting between Alpha and the very tall, gravelly-voiced man who would become Beta, which is effectively the origin of the Whisperers, too.\n\nThe flashbacks are set seven years ago (which should mean three years or so after the events of \u201cOmega,\u201d based on the 9 or so years in total that have passed since the zombie apocalypse began). The woman who would become Alpha (Samantha Morton) has learned the trick of walking among the dead, which is shambling while growling and wearing a dark hoodie. Young Lydia is shambling too, but she\u2019s looking pretty much straight down while wearing over-the-ear earphones to keep her from constantly hearing the growls of the undead. It\u2019s pretty damn smart, and only stops working when a zombie bumps into her and knocks them down, right as a nearby woman is getting eaten alive and screaming. The terrified Lydia screams, forcing Alpha to drag her into a nearby sanitarium.\n\nInside they find, uh, Jason Vorhees \u2014 well, a reasonable facsimile. It\u2019s a very tall man wearing a ski mask and wielding a giant machete, which is a lovely TWD-style twist. But the man hesitates to kill her and her daughter, even allowing them to stay the night, and Alpha knows she can dominate him. She even rifles through his food supplies, humming a song even when he orders her to stop.\n\nBeta (Ryan Hurst) before he became Beta. (Image: Jace Downs, AMC)\n\nIt turns out the two of them have a lot in common, which is to say they\u2019re both bonkers. \u201cThe dead are free,\u201d pre-Alpha tells him reverently. \u201cI like the song of the dead,\u201d pre-Beta says. \u201cIt\u2019s the only song I never want to end.\u201d When the two go on a small zombie murder spree later, she dubs him B \u2014 not a name, since the dead don\u2019t have names, but a letter \u2014 and herself A. Then she explains her post-apocalyptic philosophy, as she cuts out the zombies\u2019 guts to save for later (to cover herself with to safely walk among the dead). \u201cThere\u2019s only two kinds of people left in this world: Ones brave enough to walk with the dead, and everybody else.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, A also \u201ccomforts\u201d Lydia, telling her if she doesn\u2019t get brave she\u2019ll be abandoned, and then demanding her kid stop referring to her as \u201cMama.\u201d The very young Lydia does her best, first refusing to sleep with her bunny doll and then coating herself with the zombie guts her mother had collected to try to hang out with some zombies all by herself. A worried A tries to find her \u2014 clearly full of more maternal feelings than she\u2019s letting on \u2014 and finds B\u2019s room, where the walls are covered with photos he\u2019s scratched the faces off of, as well as walls covered in graffiti of various sanity levels. B arrives just in time to see A kill a zombie that shambles into the room, and screams, \u201cNo!\u201d\n\nAlpha, uh, after she became Alpha, I guess. (Image: Jace Downs, AMC)\n\nAll this is of course intercut with the very recent past (more or less concurrent with the first episode of the season), where Alpha also ends up wrestling with her maternal instincts. It begins when she tells Beta to gather more zombies for their mega-herd and to bring the sisters with him. One is named Frances (well, someone who was called Frances before she abandoned her name to join the Whisperers) and the other is unnamed, so I\u2019ll just call her Sister for the moment.\n\nWhile wandering among the zombies they\u2019ve collected, Frances starts hearing an imaginary baby cry because it turns out she\u2019s the one who was forced to abandon her own baby last season during the Whisperers\u2019 confrontation with Hilltop. She\u2019s still traumatized by her loss and has a small breakdown. The sobbing attracts the attention of the zombies, forcing Beta and the sister to escape and leave the herd they collected behind.\n\nBack the Whisperer camp, Beta is very much about to murder Frances when Alpha stops him and grabs the girl for a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. The terror of what Alpha is going to do to her snaps Frances out of her funk, and she screams, but all Alpha ends up doing in holding her as she cries and repents. Later, when Beta realises she let Frances live despite her weakness, he confronts Alpha, demanding to know why the girl wasn\u2019t punished, why haven\u2019t they destroyed Alexandria and the other colonies yet, and why Alpha keeps leaving the camp at night. He gets no real answers.\n\nThe next day, the Whisperers are on the move when they see the burning satellite streak through the air, agitating the zombies something fierce. This problem is compounded when Frances, despite last night\u2019s claim she\u2019s fine and super-glad she abandoned her baby to die, sees a zombie wearing an empty baby carrier \u2014 a pretty chilling sight \u2014 and freaks out. Screaming, she leaps onto the zombie\u2019s back for some unfathomable purpose, and the zombies realise there\u2019s food hiding among them. A few Whisperers get eaten, and Alpha is grabbed by zombies trying to get to the wailing Frances until Sister runs into the crowd, throws Frances to the ground to be killed/silenced/eaten, and pulls Alpha out of danger.\n\nGamma (Thora Birch) either before or after she became Gamma. Look, there was a lot of zombie shambling this episode. (Image: Jace Downs, AMC)\n\nKilling your own sister to save the pack leader is exactly what the Whisperers are all about, and Alpha could not be more thrilled with Sister and dubs her Gamma, which makes her the third-ranking member of the group. (This is probably the time to mention she\u2019s played by Ghost World\u2019s Thora Birch.) Afterward, Beta is genuinely mad at Alpha for being so calm about all the mayhem and goes to confront her, only to discover she\u2019s gone to their old camp \u2014 where he finds Alpha holding Lydia\u2019s bunny doll. Beta realises several things at once: Not only did Alpha not kill her daughter, as she\u2019d sworn she\u2019d done, but she still wants Lydia back in defiance of the Whisperers\u2019 code.\n\nAlpha, for the very first time, looks weak \u2014 she is weak. She pleads with him not to tell the others her daughter is alive. \u201cShe was dead to me the minute she was born,\u201d she yells, trying to convince herself as much as Beta. It all builds to a frenzy where she destroys the camp, which is intercut with an equally upset pre-Beta in the past, destroying his room in grief and anger. \u201cI know you better than you know yourself,\u201d A tells him just as he\u2019s about to kill her. \u201cYou are not broken. You were made for this world.\u201d\n\nWhen Lydia (who survived her jaunt) bursts in, yelling to B that her mum is trying to save him, he collapses by the corpse, moaning how he can\u2019t leave him. It\u2019s clearly the other guy from the faceless photo A saw, someone B cared about. That\u2019s when A and B make a fateful decision together. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to,\u201d A tells him enigmatically, and B begins to cut off the deceased loved one\u2019s face. The camera cuts to the present, indicating it\u2019s the half-rotted skin-mask Beta is wearing even now.\n\nAlpha, once she collects herself, tells Beta it\u2019s time to go back and destroy the colonists, to teach them a lesson about how their civilisation is a mere fantasy. All that\u2019s left is for Alpha, on the return march, to peel off and spot Carol across the chasm, syncing up with the end of last week\u2019s episode.\n\nAlthough I wish we\u2019d gotten a little more momentum on the season\u2019s main conflict before a full-episode flashback, \u201cWe Are the End of the World\u201d is a very good episode of The Walking Dead. Samantha Morton does a particularly fantastic job as Alpha, somehow finding the perfect middle between her previous flashback as a domineering matriarch and the brutal, charismatic leader she is in the present. The evolution is distinct and fascinating.\n\nBeta after he became Beta and a snappy dresser. (Image: Jace Downs, AMC)\n\nIt\u2019s also very nice to see there\u2019s more to Alpha than we\u2019ve previously been shown, and that she\u2019s wrestling with very real emotions even as she mercilessly leads her people as a sort of mega-Darwinist who kills, or allows to be killed, anyone she considers weak, including babies. (Those weak, weak babies. Get your shit together, babies!) Her powerful maternal feelings in the past still haunt her in the present, despite the years of trying to convince herself that her daughter was dead to her \u201cthe minute she was born,\u201d as she told Beta. It\u2019s echoed by her relationship with Frances. When Lydia was captured but not \u201cofficially\u201d abandoned last season, Alpha had zero problems commanding Frances to abandon her baby in a zombie-populated field. Now, with Lydia having chosen the colonists over the Whisperers, Alpha can\u2019t help but empathise with the equally mourning Frances, despite everything Alpha\u2019s said, built, and done over the last seven years.\n\nLast but not least, there\u2019s Beta. Even though there\u2019s not a lot of depth to his character \u2014 he\u2019s unable to move on from the shambling corpse of someone he loves, standard Walking Dead procedure \u2014 the figurative and literal writing on the wall compares him to Morgan in TWD\u2019s best episode ever, \u201cClear.\u201d Both Morgan and Beta are broken when Rick and A found them, going crazy in isolation, scribbling their obsessive thoughts on every surface. Interestingly, it\u2019s Morgan who was too far gone for Rick to reach, while A was able to \u201csave\u201d Beta, who\u2019s has found purpose and a bizarre sort of stability among the Whisperers. Yet when Morgan found his own peace, he wasn\u2019t strong enough to maintain it (thanks to that darned cantaloupe).\n\nAll in all, it was a surprisingly thoughtful Walking Dead, but also a very special one, because it gives us something we arguably haven\u2019t seen since the Governor in season three \u2014 a conflicted primary antagonist. Negan, the nihilistic Wolves, the cannibals of Terminus, all of them were completely secure in their villainy. Alpha was as well until Lydia abandoned her, but now she\u2019s showing weakness and mercy in the society where she effectively outlawed both. We\u2019ll see if Alpha has truly moved past it as she tells Beta, or if it will come into play as the war between the Whisperers and the colonists begins. But even if it doesn\u2019t, The Walking Dead will be richer for showing us that it\u2019s there.\n\nOut of the zombie apocalypse, into the sanitarium with the machete-wielding masked man.
