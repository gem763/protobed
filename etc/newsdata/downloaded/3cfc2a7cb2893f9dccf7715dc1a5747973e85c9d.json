Isis claimed she died in a Jordanian airstrike in Raqqa. Her body has not been recovered.\n\nOn Sunday her father, Carl Mueller, told the Arizona Republic: \u201cWhat this man did to Kayla \u2013 he kidnapped her. She was held in many prisons. She was held in solitary confinement. She was tortured. She was intimidated. She was ultimately raped by al-Baghdadi himself.\n\n\u201cHe either killed her or he was complicit in her murder. I\u2019ll let people who read this article make up their own mind how a parent should feel.\u201d\n\nWhen Kayla\u2019s death was confirmed, Mueller\u2019s family released a letter she sent from captivity.\n\n\u201cI have been shown in darkness, light,\u201d she wrote, \u201c[and] have learned that even in prison, one can be free. I am grateful. I have come to see that there is good in every situation, sometimes we just have to look for it.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday her mother, Marsha Mueller, said: \u201cI still want to know, \u2018Where is Kayla?\u2019 and what truly happened to her and what aren\u2019t we being told. Someone knows, and I\u2019m praying with all my heart that someone in this world will bring us those answers.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe finally brought justice to a man that beheaded the three Americans, two journalists and a humanitarian worker.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to James Foley and Steven Sotloff, both freelance journalists, and Peter Kassig, a humanitarian worker, who were all killed in 2014.\n\nWhen she was captured, Mueller had been visiting a hospital run by the international aid group M\u00e9decines Sans Fronti\u00e8res. O\u2019Brien said she was \u201ca humanitarian, great young American, idealistic, young girl\u201d.\n\nO\u2019Brien added: \u201cOne of the things that Gen Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, did was named the operation that took down al-Baghdadi after Kayla Mueller, after what she had suffered. And that was something that people should know.\u201d", "description": "Aid worker kidnapped in 2013 was imprisoned and tortured by Isis, and repeatedly sexually abused by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8fd0db9eaf390145f702920b6a4d9e2b5d6d204/0_125_2480_1489/master/2480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0f49ca2c91f79aabfc192dafbb7cc91", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
