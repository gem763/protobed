Companies like IBM and Oracle also competed for the contract since the bidding process opened up in July. In April, IBM and Oracle were eliminated from the race, while Google dropped out in late 2018 over concerns that it would be unable to fulfill the terms of the contract.\n\nPreviously, President Donald Trump reportedly wanted to \"scuttle\" the bidding process for JEDI. Experts previously speculated that Trump's public feud with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos \u2014 who also owns The Washington Post, which has published coverage critical of the president \u2014 might have worked against Amazon Web Services in the bidding process.\n\nTrump had demanded more information about JEDI after hearing about complaints on the bidding process, and he promised to look into the deal after receiving letters on the matter from lawmakers, including Sen. Marco Rubio. In August, the deal award was delayed for furthe review, reportedly because the White House was concerned that Amazon would win.\n\n\"The National Defense Strategy dictates that we must improve the speed and effectiveness with which we develop and deploy modernized technical capabilities to our women and men in uniform,\" DOD Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy said in a statement. \"The DOD Digital Modernization Strategy was created to support this imperative. This award is an important step in execution of the Digital Modernization Strategy.\"\n\nIndustry analysts predicted that Amazon Web Services was the frontrunner to win the contract, although others have said that Microsoft Azure has grown quickly as well and invested significant resources in improving its government cloud.\n\n\"We're surprised about this conclusion,\" an AWS spokesperson said. \"AWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion. We remain deeply committed to continuing to innovate for the new digital battlefield where security, efficiency, resiliency, and scalability of resources can be the difference between success and failure.\"\n\nAlthough analysts saw the bid as a two-horse race, the competition was still fierce, to the point that even an anti-Amazon smear campaign, apparently linked to Oracle, spread around Washington, DC.\n\nOracle and IBM also filed official protests about the contract, and Oracle filed a lawsuit saying that Amazon was favored to win JEDI and had conflicts of interest in the process.\n\nMissing from the bid is Google, which dropped out of the bid last October.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to Microsoft for comment.", "description": "The battle was long and fierce, but Microsoft scored the upset.
