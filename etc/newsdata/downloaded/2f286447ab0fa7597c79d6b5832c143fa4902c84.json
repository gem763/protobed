The sales were executed at an average price of around $19.15 per share.\n\nSee Also: Ex-Overstock CEO Byrne Talks Timing Of Resignation With Fox, 'Political Espionage'\n\nBackground\n\nByrne is credited with spearheading Overstock\u2019s aggressive push into cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Overstock was one of the earliest online retailers to accept bitcoin back in 2014, and shares of the company\u2019s stock soared more than 400% during the cryptocurrency boom of 2017.\n\nIn recent years, Byrne has been vocal about his efforts to sell Overstock\u2019s e-commerce business and focus entirely on its cryptocurrency and blockchain investments. Unfortunately, Byrne never found a buyer for the e-commerce business, and Overstock\u2019s share price crashed from near $90 in early 2018 to under $9 earlier this year.\n\nShares spiked over the summer when Byrne said there were multiple buyers interested in the e-commerce business, but they cooled when no subsequent deal was announced.\n\nIn August, Byrne confirmed he had been involved romantically with Russian spy Maria Butina, tweeting that he had been \u201cthe notorious \u2018missing Chapter1\u2019 of the Russian investigation.\u201d\n\nOverstock shares tanked, and Byrne stepped down as CEO 10 days later.\n\nThe Crypto Dividend Plan\n\nByrne has often butted heads with Overstock short sellers, even going so far as to claim short selling efforts were being led by an unidentified \u201cSith Lord,\u201d a person whom he claimed to be \u201ca master criminal from the 1980s.\u201d\n\nPrior to leaving his position as CEO, Byrne implemented a plan to put short sellers in a difficult position by issuing an Overstock dividend paid in an obscure digital security. Since short sellers are responsible for paying dividends on their borrowed shares, many simply covered their positions prior to the Sept. 23 record date rather than deal with the dividend ordeal.\n\nThe mass of short caused Overstock shares to roughly double from around $15 per share to open September to above $29 per share by Sept. 13. Byrne seemingly took advantage of the opportunity to unload his position this week.\n\nSee Also: 12 Most Expensive Stocks To Short\n\nOverstock shares dropped 16% on Wednesday and Thursday morning on reports of Byrne\u2019s exit and a New York Post report that brokers such as JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were allowing short sellers to pay the cash equivalent to the digital dividend.\n\nByrne commented on the situation on his DeepCapture blog on Thursday:\n\n\u201cI started receiving detailed messages saying that since the morning of last Friday (13th), major prime brokers on Wall Street (e.g., JP Morgan, Morgan, and Goldman) were telling clients that the SEC had let them know last Thursday night and Friday morning that they going to do something special to let short-sellers off the hook (and incidentally, I can easily trace back the names of the people at the primes saying that). These prime brokers were, in short, promising clients that the SEC would call \u2018Bazoomba!\u2019 for them.\"\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take\n\nThe Overstock crypto dividend is set to be paid on Nov. 15 and will mark the end of the Patrick Byrne era at Overstock. Investors will now be able to return their attention to the company\u2019s plans for the future, which may or may not include the sale of its e-commerce business.\n\nInvestors should get a clearer picture of the company\u2019s path forward when it reports third-quarter earnings in November.\n\nDo you agree with this take?
