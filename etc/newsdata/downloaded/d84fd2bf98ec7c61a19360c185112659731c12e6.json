And that worldly wiseness, if you like, showed tonight. Incredibly mature performance, you could hear his communication on the pitch I\u2019m sure from where you were sat.\n\n\u201cAnd I said to him last night [the eve of the game], the level of opponent often isn\u2019t the issue with playing for England. It\u2019s being able to handle wearing an England shirt. I didn\u2019t think he would have to go through everything tonight that he did, but he\u2019s a very impressive young man and, even after the game, he\u2019s spoken brilliantly as well. So, I couldn\u2019t be happier with him or for him.\u201d\n\nIt was Southgate himself who presented Mings with the jersey, joking that it was quite a drop-off from Trent Alexander-Arnold, who had Prince William.\n\nThe England manager however generally praised the resilience of his players.\n\n\u201cThe way they dealt with everything because a lot of our young players haven\u2019t experienced, from Friday night, the fallout of a difficult, poor England performance which is unique, compared to the clubs. So, managing the group through that; their response to that was excellent. Their focus and preparation for the game was excellent.\n\n\"Then, tonight [there was] something completely different for them all to deal with but we knew tonight was enough experience for a multitude of reasons. So, again, the response, their focus, the way that they played throughout the stoppages in the game and back into it was remarkable. So, bizarrely, I think they\u2019ve actually gained strength from the experience.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have had to go through that. But I think in terms of the way they dealt with it, I don\u2019t think they could have done it in a more impressive manner.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate praised the \u201coutstanding leadership\u201d of Tyrone Mings in what must have been one of the most challenging debuts possible, amid the racist abuse of the 6-0 win over Bulgaria.", "authors": ["Miguel Delaney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/14/Tyrone-Mings.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
