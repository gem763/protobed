Well, it\u2019s a tale as old as time, with Aiman accusing the doctor of having inappropriate relations with his wife while he was working abroad.\n\nLocal Malay-language daily mStar details that the man\u2019s wife is a nurse.\n\nHaving returned home from working abroad in Dubai, Aiman is said to have become suspicious of his wife\u2019s comings and goings, and decided that his next most logical step would be to spy on her, tracking her movements.\n\nAccording to the report, he accessed different CCTV recordings that showed his wife going out with the doctor. He also claims that he had evidence of damning access card entries and exits, and a hotel receipt.\n\nIt seems that that was all of the evidence that Aiman needed, and he decided to take matters into his own hands, attacking the doctor while he was at work. In the violent clip, he can be seen kicking and stomping on the doctor, who fell to the ground. Eventually, a woman comes between the doctor and attacker.\n\n\n\n\n\nInilah Gambar nurse yg curang pada suami kerja Oversea\u2026Kedapatan Doktor masuk rumah semasa Suami bekerja luar\u2026 \u7531 Wan Azri \u53d1\u5e03\u4e8e 2019\u5e7410\u67085\u65e5\u5468\u516d\n\nThe entire incident was recorded on camera by another individual who is unknown. Confused, the doctor told them that the issue between Aiman, his wife and himself had already been discussed and resolved.\n\nAccording to an interview after the clip went viral, Aiman acknowledged that it was wrong to attack the doctor, as he was very angry at the time. He alleges that the affair had been going on over the last eight months, and that his wife had previously asked him for a divorce. At the time, he says he was unaware that the doctor was in the picture.\n\nHowever, family members of Aiman\u2019s wife allege that he was a jealous husband, and had been accusing his wife of sundry indiscretions over the last two years. Her family spoke to the doctor, and advised him to stop being friends with the Aiman\u2019s wife, to avoid further disagreements prior to the attack.\n\nThe doctor has since lodged a police report, and the case is now being investigated.\n\nThis article, [VIDEO] Doctor attacked in clinic by man accusing him of committing adultery, originally appeared on Coconuts, Asia's leading alternative media company.
