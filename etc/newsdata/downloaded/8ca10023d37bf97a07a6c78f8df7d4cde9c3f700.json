For Trump, it is easy to imagine an entire year on the campaign trail spent denouncing the numberless iniquities of some rando FBI agent, who will be presented as if he were the Palpatine-like mastermind behind a vast and rather sinister conspiracy to undermine the administration and the republic itself. He will spend 20 minutes rehearsing the details in Ohio and Pennsylvania; the crowds will shout \u201cTREASON! TREASON!\u201d or \u201cLOCK THEM UP!\u201d or \u201cCOMPLYING WITH FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY, YOU GODLESS COMMIES!\u201d or some such. A splendid time for all, I\u2019m sure.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats will be able to follow the template established for them by Republicans in recent months. These, we will be told, are insignificant crimes in themselves, ones that would not have been prosecuted in the first place if their opponents were not grossly abusing their authority by carrying out a pointless investigation of things that happened four years ago now. Who cares what a few meaningless bunglers were or were not getting up to? All of this is a distraction from the real issue, which is the unspeakable corruption of Trump and his cronies, who are using the present inquiry as a smokescreen.\n\nBoth of these competing narratives \u2014 which are not really mutually exclusive \u2014 would find cheerleaders in the relevant corners of the media. The journalists who have spent Trump\u2019s entire first term discussing the sacrosanct nature of federal probes would explain away the casual nature of the offenses; the president\u2019s fans would insist that nothing could be more appalling than \u2014 gasp \u2014 lying to a bona fide Justice Department investigator.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matthew Walther", "Theweek.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
