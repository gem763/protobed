The great thing about our boys is they don\u2019t give up,\u201d Wales coach Warren Gatland said.\n\nTwo tries in three minutes got France off to a flying start as Sebastien Vahaamahina and then Charles Ollivon, in glorious style, both crossed inside the first 10 minutes of a helter-skelter first half.\n\nWales\u2019 Aaron Wainwright pounced on a loose ball and Dan Biggar stroked the conversion and then a penalty to make it 12-10, but Virimi Vakatawa dived over after several phases to put France 19-10 up at the break.\n\nBut in the 49th minute, Vahaamahina saw red for his elbow to Wainwright\u2019s face in a maul \u2014 echoing then Wales captain Sam Warburton\u2019s sending-off in the 2011 semi-final, won 9-8 by France.\n\nA Biggar penalty reduced the arrears but France bravely held out until six minutes from time, when Moriarty bundled over and Biggar knocked over the vital conversion to snatch it for the Welsh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the last time we met in a World Cup was very similar in a one-point game as well,\u201d said Gatland, who kept his counsel on Vahaamahina\u2019s elbow to the jaw of Wainwright.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could complain about that \u2014 the officials dealt with it appropriately. Unfortunately that\u2019s what rugby is about,\u201d he added.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 South Africa broke Japanese hearts with a 26-3 quarter-final victory on Sunday to set up a Rugby World Cup semi-final against Wales,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/443a27_south-africa-scrum-faf-de-klerk-scored-try-in-south-africa-end-japanese-dream-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
