And I could see the officer walking up to the mail van and discharging his weapon into it.\n\n\"And I believe that was when the shooter was killed.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted that he had been briefed by Attorney General Bill Barr.\n\nThe latest incident came after the early August mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart, where many victims were Hispanic.\n\nIn that case, officers arrested Patrick Crusius, 21, a white Texan, who told police that he was targeting \"Mexicans,\" according to an arrest warrant published by US media.\n\nThe tragedy in El Paso was committed on the basis of \"racist\" anti-Mexican rhetoric, Jesus Seade, Mexico's foreign ministry undersecretary for North America, said during a memorial after that shooting.\n\nCritics of Trump have accused him of stoking such hatred.\n\nA series of mass shootings\n\nThe shooting in El Paso came hours before a gunman in Dayton, Ohio killed nine people, reigniting calls for gun control in the United States where firearms were linked to nearly 40 000 deaths in 2017.\n\n\"We need to end this epidemic,\" former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke reacted on Twitter after the latest killings.\n\nO'Rourke, a Democratic presidential hopeful, expressed sympathy with \"everyone in West Texas who has to endure this again.\"\n\nAnother Democratic contender, former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, appealed on Twitter to the Republican-controlled Senate \"who refuse to move on gun reform.\"\n\n\"What is the number? How many Americans are you willing to sacrifice to the NRA?\"\n\nAfter a series of mass shootings since late July Trump had expressed provisional support for implementing universal background checks.\n\nThe president's position is crucial, because congressional Republicans, who count on gun rights supporters for votes, cannot move on tougher firearms legislation without his support.\n\nHowever, US media including The Washington Post and The Atlantic in late August quoted White House sources as saying Trump promised National Rifle Association head Wayne LaPierre he would not pressure Congress for a stringent, universal, pre-sale review of all gun buyers.", "description": "A gunman hijacked a US postal truck and opened fire at random in the US state of Texas, shooting dead at least five people and wounding many others before dying in a shootout with officers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/323/d109d307b647415c8b56c878358b1933.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-01"}
