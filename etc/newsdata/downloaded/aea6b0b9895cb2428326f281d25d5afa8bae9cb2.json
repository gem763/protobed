But he said the market was heading somewhere very different today, and the years ahead could be a lot different.\n\n\"My guess is, next five years, leadership is going to be a very elusive,\" he told Business Insider in a recent interview. \"It's very unlikely to be as unidimensional in the next five to 10 years as it has been in the last five to 10 years.\"\n\nUnlike the past decade \u2014 which was marked by a steady global recovery, rapid technological innovation, and consistently low interest rates \u2014 Doll said it was difficult to identify trends that made any particular industry, region, or investing style look like clear winners.\n\nIn its place, he instead sees a churning market where leadership flits from one style or area to another, limiting the performance of most assets.\n\n\"The returns on stocks, bonds, and cash in the next five years are going to be lower than long-term returns,\" Doll said.\n\nIn other words, Doll is all in on the theory that selectivity is going to be much more important in the years ahead. He laid out four themes that he was using to find successful stocks in that more difficult environment.\n\nThe economic cycle\n\nDoll said he didn't see any signs that a recession would arrive before 2021, and he thinks investors who are in a rush to position themselves defensively ahead of that eventual downturn are making a double mistake. They're missing out on actual growth and overvaluing defensive stocks in the process.\n\n\"I want to own those companies that do benefit from the cycle because the cycle is not over, and I want to be underweight [or] short those 'recession-proof' stocks that have gotten way ahead of themselves,\" he said.\n\nCompanies that could fit that description include Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Apple, all significant holdings for Doll's Nuveen Equity Long/Short I fund.\n\nWhile Doll says he's not overwhelmingly positive on the US economy today, he's still betting on the strength of its consumer segment, and the trends in spending and entertainment that have developed over the past two decades.\n\nRead more: A $60 billion investing firm breaks down why a force that's helped the market's biggest companies for 30 years is headed for a reckoning\n\nFree cash flow\n\nDoll said that if he had to decide whether to invest in a stock based on just one piece of data, he would want to know the company's cash flow.\n\n\"I love a company that has massive free cash flow, is trying to reinvest in their business for growth, but still has more money left over where they can increase the dividend and buy back some stock,\" he said. \"There aren't enough of those.\"\n\nThe top holdings of Doll's Nuveen Large Cap Core I might fit that description, however. Its biggest investments are in Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.\n\nPricing power\n\nDoll said that wage growth in the US has picked up slightly, putting corporate profits under some pressure just at the same time revenue growth is slowing. He said he was looking for companies that are either boosting their sales or have the ability to increase their prices, describing that as an important edge as growth declines.\n\n\"You've got differentiate yourself in a world that is slowing,\" he said. He said consumer discretionary companies, slower-growing tech companies, and healthcare-services companies all had promise in that area.\n\nDoll added that the healthcare-services sector offered upside because investors have overestimated the political risk to most of those companies.\n\n\"The chance of 'Medicare for All,' which has damaged the healthcare-services companies, is close to zero\" in 2020, he said. Doll described it as a pretty remote possibility even if Democrats end up with control of the presidency and both houses of Congress.\n\nTo that end, Nuveen's Equity Market Neutral I fund has a string of investments in health care companies such as Exelixis, Cardinal Health, and Biogen.\n\nRead more: The president of a $4.7 billion firm told us where he's investing and why he's staying calm in a time of 'escalating panic' in markets\n\nStay US-focused\n\nDoll said threats to multinational companies were rising. Populism remains politically strong, and countries simply aren't using trade for a source of growth, as they did in decades past.\n\n\"Because trade as a percent of GDP for virtually every country in the world is shrinking, suddenly domestic growth becomes more and more important,\" he said.\n\nAll of that makes the US more appealing, both because of its growth potential and lesser vulnerability to catastrophic trade disruptions.\n\n\"We are the most isolated economy on the planet,\" he said. \"Imports and exports mean less for us than any other country.\"", "description": "Bob Doll, the chief equity strategist for Nuveen Asset Management, shares his top investment themes as the stock market's top winners weaken.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/53c689b86bb3f78776259bc2-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
