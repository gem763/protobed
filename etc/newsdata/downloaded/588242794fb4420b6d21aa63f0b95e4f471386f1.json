The United States, wrote James, \u201cwill never be free of racial prejudice for the same reason that it will never enshrine racial prejudice in anything like the Nuremberg Laws: it\u2019s a free country.\u201d He pithily concluded that \u201cthe insuperable problem with The Plot against America is that America is against the plot.\u201d\n\nBari Weiss, a staff writer and editor for the opinion section of the New York Times, used to hold the same iron conviction that the United States would never succumb to the plague of anti-Semitism. In her slim new book, How to Fight Anti-Semitism, Weiss confesses she is no longer so sanguine about the status of the \u201cJewish question\u201d in the land of the free, even if the symptoms of a resurgent anti-Semitism aren\u2019t as acute as they are in the Old World. A fair reading of the times suggests that her newfound anxiety is prudent.\n\nNot so long ago, sounding the alarm about the Jewish place in American life would have been dismissed as hyperbolic or hysterical. By the standards of Jewish history, the asylum discovered in the United States after the Shoah was an almost unimaginable gift. Weiss recounts that growing up on American soil around the turn of the 21st century, members of her community knew they were \u201cthe lucky ones.\u201d The faint echoes of anti-Semitism were at a safe remove in this secular republic so profoundly shaped by its confrontations with both the Nazi abattoir and the Soviet gulag. \u201cSurvival had no longer been our concern,\u201d she writes. In America, the sons and daughters of Abraham and Sarah managed to flourish \u201clike no other diaspora in history,\u201d even if ample evidence of the vehemence ranged against their tribe could be found in the foreign press: pictures of buses blown apart by suicide bombers in Jerusalem, the YouTube video showing Daniel Pearl\u2019s gruesome beheading in Karachi, firebombed synagogues in Stockholm, Jewish cemeteries desecrated in Paris, or attacks on those wearing a kippah in Berlin.\n\nWeiss suspects that the failure of anti-Semitism to take hold on this side of the Atlantic can be credited to the American regime\u2019s early efforts to inoculate the country against this venomous mania. In 1790, George Washington gave his assurance to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, R.I., that American Jews would \u201cpossess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship.\u201d In the same letter, America\u2019s first president promised that the new republic would give \u201cto bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\u201d As a nation founded on the universalist claims of the Declaration of Independence, the United States has seemed, for all its flaws, particularly ill-suited to federally sanctioned prejudice. In addition, the \u201cspecial nature of America,\u201d in Weiss\u2019s telling, includes an attachment to the Hebraic tradition as reflected in the dizzying array of biblical place names that dot its landscape. This, in turn, has nourished America\u2019s long-standing alliance with the State of Israel. All of this has predisposed America to be \u201ca New Jerusalem for the Jewish people.\u201d\n\nThis is not to deny that American Jews occasionally found themselves (as the author did, growing up in Pittsburgh) on the receiving end of rancid jokes about \u201cpicking up pennies,\u201d along with creepy \u201cquestions about horns.\u201d More often than not, however, these insults didn\u2019t escalate into injuries, in large part because this ill-concealed prejudice was understood by mainstream society to be anathema to American politics and philosophy. It was tempting, therefore, to write off these churlish anti-Jewish outbursts as nothing more than \u201cvestiges of an uglier, more violent past.\u201d Any suggestion that they were harbingers of a resurgent chauvinism threatening Jewish life and limb would have been greeted with mirth.\n\nWeiss\u2019s visceral confidence that Jews (along with other religious minorities) would continue to enjoy the fruits of an apparently eternal American exceptionalism was shattered when her kehilla, or community, was visited by evil. In October 2018, eleven Jews were murdered in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh where Weiss became a bat mitzvah. In that event, her hometown temple earned the awful distinction of suffering the deadliest attack on Jews in American history. The perpetrator of this heinous act was decidedly \u201chomegrown,\u201d to use the contemporary argot, attacking a synagogue that had opened its doors to persecuted people of all faiths as part of National Refugee Shabbat, a project of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.\n\nThose who insisted that this was a singular episode of mass murder would be proved wrong a few months later when another white supremacist struck a synagogue in San Diego. The roots of anti-Jewish violence (if not yet anti-Jewish pogroms) that had long found infertile soil in the United States at last discovered a more hospitable patch of terrain.\n\nAnyone familiar with the sordid record of fear and loathing toward Jews knows that severing these roots will be a task fraught with difficulty. (If you are not familiar, procuring a copy of How to Fight Anti-Semitism would be a very good place to start.) The first problem in understanding this complex phenomenon is that Judaism itself is properly understood not merely as a religion or an ethnicity, but as a people and a civilization. It follows, as Weiss succinctly explains, that there is no single reason for anti-Semitism.\n\nConsidering this hatred, one cannot fail to be struck \u2014 as Jean-Paul Sartre was in his essay \u201cAnti-Semite and Jew\u201d \u2014 by its lack of any recognizable logic save \u201cthe logic of passion.\u201d Call me unlucky, but in the past year alone, in places as diverse as Dubai, Beirut, and Istanbul, your obedient servant has encountered this fit of illogic at close range. Over dinner or drinks, elite members of these societies (anti-Semitism frequently infects the pseudo-intellectual) unburdened themselves of the opinion that the official narrative about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks is a cheap ruse, and al-Qaeda\u2019s holy warriors were not responsible for this obscenity. (No prizes for guessing which intelligence service of a certain Levantine nation was fingered instead.)\n\nThis ancient animosity would not have proved so dynamic and durable down the centuries if it weren\u2019t essentially protean. Though it\u2019s often thought of as a neurosis, Saul Bellow insisted that it was a psychosis. It involves no exaggeration to say that the Weltanschauung of Jew-hatred is so replete with contradiction as to be schizophrenic.\n\nAfter originating in Egypt, Judeophobia has been maintained as a fashion by such discrepant forces as medieval Christianity and modern Islam. In the 20th century, virulent forms of the virus broke out in the Roman Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church (the former being in sympathy with fascism and the latter blessing the execrable Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion that is the source of many conspiracy theories relating to the Jews, which were later reproduced in Hamas\u2019s charter). In its various permutations, anti-Semitism has conscripted the Jew as a nefarious partisan and practitioner of capitalism and, alternately, of Bolshevism. (As Marx proved, not even being born a Jew according to the strict matrilineal principles of Jewish law is a guarantee against indulging this primitive stupidity.) Jews have been portrayed as vicious race contaminators as well as an all-powerful tribe standing apart from society. Anti-Semitism is not, in other words, a run-of-the-mill prejudice akin to racism against, say, \u201cblack\u201d Africans. Rather, in the words of the historian Peter Hayes, it is \u201ca kind of superstition\u201d that conceives of a universal conspiracy in which the Jews are the sinister vanguard.\n\nHow to Fight Anti-Semitism focuses more on present than past manifestations of this \u201cdisease of the mind,\u201d as Weiss dubs it, in echo of the historian Paul Johnson. The primary targets of her sharp pen are not the Gospel of John or even Marxist revolutionaries (it\u2019s not for nothing that the German socialist August Bebel described anti-Semitism as the socialism of fools). Anti-Semitism has spread and mutated, appearing in the guise of a modern theocratic fascism while also poisoning diverse political movements in the West.\n\nAs Weiss is fully aware, her book is most apt to court controversy by providing a political guide to these fresh outbreaks of anti-Semitism. She begins rather dauntingly by noting that Jews in the West, especially in Europe, are confronted by a \u201cthree-headed dragon.\u201d First, there is an antagonistic environment for Jews, thanks in large measure to the rapid growth of Islamism on the Old Continent. Second, there is ideological vilification by the political Left, which increasingly regards Israel as an illegitimate state serving no other purpose than as a bastion of Western (read: white) colonialism. Third, there is a recrudescence of reactionary populism on the political right that, while often professing sympathy for Israel, evinces a fervent commitment to blood-and-soil politics that seldom ends well for Jews.\n\nNot everybody will agree with Weiss\u2019s portrait of the hydra-headed enemy, which itself points to part of the problem. The tribal impulse in our political life has grown so pronounced that it has overwhelmed a common civic culture, rendering many classical liberals politically homeless. There is a well-oiled habit among the political class and in the press of excusing obvious, often deplorable, transgressions by one\u2019s \u201cown\u201d side. The acid test for fighting anti-Semitism, as with so many other derangements, is to face it down with equal enthusiasm and commitment when it flares up on one\u2019s team \u2014 or, better yet, to be more discriminating about which team one belongs to in the first place.\n\nThe Left\n\nThe true anti-Semite is easy enough to spot on the lunatic fringe, but it\u2019s another matter if you\u2019re not aware of the existence of plural lunatic fringes. Most children of the Enlightenment have been trained to discern this toxic ideology when religious fanatics inveigh against the Jews\u2019 supposed responsibility for the murder of Christ or when voices of the \u201calt-right\u201d curse the Jews for deriving from the racial gutter. But symptoms of the toxin are no less definitive when one hears of an occult world government whose \u201clobby\u201d distorts U.S. foreign policy and global financial markets, or is treated to the filthy argument that, in its methods of warfare against Hamas \u2014 a terrorist organization as well as a regime based in large measure on the desire to stamp international Jewry out of existence \u2014 the Israel Defense Forces have taken a leaf from Hitler\u2019s book.\n\nAs the Democratic party\u2019s center of gravity has moved sharply to the left in recent years, the anti-imperialist mindset has gained traction, attributing the ills of the Middle East to British and French (and, latterly, Israeli and American) power. This political evolution has been exemplified by the now-famous freshman congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, who have brought critical (if maladroit) scrutiny to bear against the U.S.-Israel alliance. Another member of \u201cthe Squad,\u201d Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has openly consorted with Jeremy Corbyn of Britain\u2019s Labour party, a fellow traveler with Islamist movements whose tenure as Leader of Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition has been marred by one anti-Semitic scandal after another.\n\nAt its worst, this mindset is prone to detecting arcane Jewish manipulations behind all earthly power. More commonly, the insurgent progressive perspective masquerades as merely anti-Zionist, conceiving of Jews as part of the coalition of the oppressor while Israel, \u201cthe Jew among the nations,\u201d is treated with frenzied derision. In addition to being indicted as the sole party responsible for the conflict with the Palestinians, and therefore almost entirely to blame for their miserable plight, Israel is portrayed as a uniquely malevolent force in the world. The dramatic rise of the BDS movement (deemed by the German Bundestag, not unjustifiably, as anti-Semitic) across the West today capably demonstrates that these vicious and extreme detractors of the Zionist entity are on the march.\n\nThis palpable and supercharged hostility has taken by surprise many liberal Zionists \u2014 as appears to have been the case for Weiss \u2014 who are given to assuming that the Left instinctively takes the side of the underdog, the immigrant, and the outsider. Although the Left has largely come by this reputation honestly, it does little good for Jews, who, despite being the principal target of hate crimes in the United States and most of Europe, scarcely qualify as an oppressed minority in the eyes of today\u2019s Left. Weiss is keen to announce and decry progressives\u2019 evolving hierarchy of privilege, whereby Zionists (i.e., the vast majority of worldwide Jewry) generally occupy the top rung as defenders of a colonial state embodying the \u201cwhite man\u2019s burden.\u201d (This narrative seldom accounts for the Mizrahi Jews, more than half of Israel\u2019s population, whose roots lie in the Middle East.)\n\nThe progressive temper does not merely direct suspicion and ire toward Israel and all its works but shows every sign of failing to recognize an enemy even when it meets one. The mainstream Left is proving increasingly blind to the clear and present danger posed by Islamist ideology and, worse, often lends aid and comfort to its cause. This vile tendency crops up regularly, but two prominent examples include the Southern Poverty Law Center (which designated the liberal Muslim reformer Maajid Nawaz an \u201canti-Muslim extremist\u201d and was later compelled to pay damages) and the Women\u2019s March (whose unscrupulous leaders Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour embraced the anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan).\n\nWeiss does not make the common mistake of conflating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism. This has always been a self-refuting standard, since, as Weiss reminds us, the earliest anti-Zionists to scorn Theodor Herzl\u2019s dream of der judenstaat were themselves Jewish (not only the left-wing critics of Palestinian-Arab dispossession but the Orthodox sects that regarded Jewish political sovereignty prior to the arrival of the messiah as blasphemous). Incidentally, some Zionists have also been quite nasty anti-Semites, including British foreign secretary Arthur Balfour whose famous 1917 declaration \u201cviewed with favor\u201d a Jewish home in the mandate of Palestine in order to empty Britain of its Jewish population.\n\nNor does Weiss argue that stinging dissent from the Israeli government, let alone a harmlessly critical HBO mini-series, constitutes anti-Semitism, or even anti-Zionism. Nonetheless, it has become difficult in practice to disentangle anti-Semitism from anti-Zionism, given that manifestations of both often share the purpose of demonization and delegitimization of the only Jewish state. (By contrast, try to imagine, if you can, a movement of similar breadth and depth aimed against another \u201cfaith-based\u201d state, Pakistan, that was similarly cobbled together out of rival ethno-religious nationalisms amid the collapsing British imperial order in 1947.)\n\nWeiss shrewdly analogizes modern anti-Zionism to the situation of a young couple weighing whether to have a child. All of the credible and practical concerns fall away once they have the baby, or else the parents are behaving immorally. Such is the case today, when the State of Israel is an established fact. To have questioned or opposed the project of building a Jewish state in the Jews\u2019 ancestral homeland before the U.N. Partition Plan of 1947 is one thing. It is quite another to endorse tearing down that living, breathing state today, in full knowledge of the enormity that would ensue. The offense here is compounded when those agitating to make Israel a pariah state demonstrate little knowledge or concern about formulating and executing a strategy to confront bellicose regimes and militant Islamist groups that imperil the Jewish state and the civilized world.\n\nThe Right\n\nIn addition to being more diffuse than many imagine, the lunatic fringe is also thicker than is generally understood. Weiss is justly concerned by the spike in violence against Jews and other minorities from the identitarian right and about the grisly ideology behind it. After some years of dormancy, in August 2017 it flared into the open in Charlottesville when a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally of white supremacists gathered at the University of Virginia to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Carrying tiki torches, these doughy goons shouted the slogans: \u201cBlood and soil,\u201d \u201cWhite Lives Matter,\u201d and, in a nod to the ancient anti-Semitic notion of the Jew as the evil puppeteer, \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d Lest we forget, President Trump\u2019s reflexive response to this wicked nonsense was to put in a good word for such \u201cvery fine people.\u201d\n\nWeiss\u2019s handling of the ugly movement known as the \u201calt-right\u201d is fairly comprehensive, and the reader emerges on guard against this ethno-religious movement in our midst. She is also alert to the threat posed by unsavory authoritarian populists across the West who, though generally willing to dispel any impression of being motivated by racism, aim to turn their societies away from the liberal tradition. In either of these guises, the chauvinist Right tends to regard Muslims as the \u201cother\u201d and casts Israel (in Weiss\u2019s wry description) as a \u201ckind of anti-Muslim Sparta\u201d rather than a pluralist democracy preserving its Jewish character even under existential threat.\n\nThe longer Israel and America remain in the saddle of populist nationalism, the more this crude description of Israel risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. (As Weiss must know, Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank will eventually become all but irrevocable, at which point the Zionist project will cease to be recognizable as a democratic Jewish state.) Stuck in a defensive crouch, Israel\u2019s conservative partisans in both countries tend to dismiss liberal scruples about the Israeli government\u2019s innumerable follies and injustices. They cheer Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s no-holds-barred posture against the Left, and the actions taken in self-defense against a militant Sunni gang in Gaza and a swelling \u201cShiite crescent\u201d across Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. These conservatives also cite the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, among other items, as reason to embrace Trump for being in the running for \u201cthe best friend Israel has ever had in the White House.\u201d\n\nAmong Zionists, Weiss helpfully distinguishes between \u201cthe David people and the Goliath people.\u201d The former think that Zion is always under siege, that any Israeli weakness will be exploited by its enemies, and that most other considerations are secondary. The latter think that Israel has accumulated such a preponderance of power that its vulnerability has been greatly diminished, and that illiberal aspects of Israel\u2019s character (consider last year\u2019s Jewish nation-state law that privileges Israel\u2019s sectarian features over its secular pluralist claims) are sapping precious legitimacy at home and abroad. Weiss\u2019s conclusion that each of these tendencies contains partial truths is fair enough as far as it goes, which is not far enough. In reality, the difference cannot be so evenly split.\n\nAs long as the political Right believes Israel\u2019s society and government require an unqualified defense, the David people cannot be acquitted on the charge of loving the Jewish state \u201cnot wisely, but too well.\u201d By refusing to hold Israel to its own standards as an exemplar of liberal democracy, such ostensible friends are rendering a grave disservice to the Zionist cause. Weiss can hardly be counted among them. She posits that \u201csupporting Israel . . . means demanding that Israel live up to its ideals,\u201d but never gets around to spelling out just what those ideals dictate in relation to the pressing need to reach a decent accommodation with the Palestinians. To be fair, Weiss does mention in passing the settlement enterprise as a valid point of criticism of Israel, and not a species of the phenomenon that is her subject. What\u2019s more, she registers a genuine sense of \u201cdespair\u201d when observing Palestinians waiting at checkpoints, and says that Palestinian suffering in the course of occupation constitutes a \u201cstain\u201d on her Jewish soul.\n\nNonetheless, the dogma of a \u201cchosen people\u201d has enabled a strident intolerance among many of Weiss\u2019s coreligionists that demands a more thoroughgoing critique than it receives in How to Fight Anti-Semitism. This is not because anti-Semitism is a response to the behavior of Jews (it absolutely is not). Rather, Israel\u2019s \u201caccidental empire\u201d of systematic land seizure in biblical Judea and Samaria is premised on a \u201ccivilization state\u201d model of nationalism profoundly at odds with the liberal ideal that will render the case for Israel increasingly toxic.\n\nMany years ago, Yehoshua Leibowitz, the editor of the Encyclopaedia Hebraica, warned of a \u201cJudeo-Nazi\u201d tendency among the messianic settlers who moved onto the occupied West Bank after 1967. One need not go that far to recognize that Israel\u2019s defensive occupation of the post-1967 territories has unloosed a xenophobic current that not only serves to deprive Palestinians of their rights and sovereignty, but also cements sectarian and racist feelings within Israel proper. (To instance one example, courtesy of the Israel Democracy Institute, 70 percent of Jewish Israelis now oppose appointing Arab Israelis to cabinet posts.)\n\nWeiss appears more panicked by the related matter of Israel\u2019s new nationalist allies (e.g., Victor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government in Hungary) who are self-proclaimed illiberal democrats and give off more than a whiff of anti-Semitism. Weiss also passionately criticizes the rabbinate\u2019s suffocating influence among Israeli Jews, and scorches Netanyahu\u2019s unfathomably crude move to pull the racist party Otzma Yehudit into his governing coalition. This is all to the good, but the failure to offer a straightforward denunciation of Israel\u2019s occupation of land claimed and inhabited by Palestinians is a baffling omission in a book about fighting anti-Semitism \u2014 again, not because Jewish settlement beyond the Green Line is in any way related to anti-Semitism, but because it weakens Israel\u2019s moral defenses when it needs them most.\n\nIf the populist-nationalist view of Israel continues to dominate the right side of the ballot in both Israel and America, and if that view continues to command electoral majorities, it will help vindicate the Left\u2019s suspicion that Israel is in essence an ethnocracy, or will soon evolve into one. As progressive politics lurches to the left, the Israeli Right will find new support in subverting democratic institutions and entrenching the occupation. In place of a smaller, plucky Israel punching above its weight against fearsome enemies while upholding a laudable multiethnic democracy, the cycle of dueling left and right populisms risks helping to foster a Greater Israel that loses sight of the liberal Zionism that birthed it. If this comes to pass, it will be a moral and political catastrophe, no matter where America\u2019s embassy in Israel is situated.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs I turned the final page of How to Fight Anti-Semitism, my mind returned to a vignette that Weiss had earlier extracted from Joachim Fest\u2019s memoir of growing up in interwar Berlin, Not I. Fest recalls his father, a pious Catholic and adamant anti-Nazi, begging his Jewish friends to leave Hitler\u2019s Germany before it was too late. Fest\u2019s father heaped praise on those in this dark time who resolutely persisted in classifying themselves \u201cGerman citizens of Jewish faith\u201d: \u201cIn their self-discipline, their quiet civility and unsentimental brilliance, they had really been the last Prussians.\u201d They had \u201conly one failing,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich became their undoing: being overwhelmingly governed by their heads, they had, in tolerant Prussia, lost their instinct for danger, which had preserved them through the ages.\u201d\n\nOnly a small number of Jews in the Third Reich lived up to the Jewish reputation for pessimism and understood what lay in wait for them. Victor Klemperer was one of them: The German-Jewish diarist whose writings eerily predicted the Holocaust said that the fate of the Jews was to be a \u201cseismic people.\u201d It would be rash for Jews anywhere, even in America, to allow this premonitory instinct to atrophy, and Weiss deserves credit for keeping it alive.\n\nThe most mournful realization generated by How to Fight Anti-Semitism involves the fantastic resilience of this disease and its protean nature, which augurs a fight that is decidedly unlikely to culminate in a decisive victory. To the contrary. Anti-Semitism is a plague whose latent tenacity ensures that Jews will not enjoy a quiet life anytime soon, but are rather condemned to live in a kind of exile \u2014 even if they happen to reside in the \u201csafe haven\u201d of the Jewish state.\n\nAs this malignant disease is confronted and engaged, the ability of Jews and philo-Semites to hold a tension within themselves between vigilance and realism is vital. Weiss\u2019s book is unbeatable at showing that \u201cnever again\u201d is a necessary but insufficient responsibility of Zionism. \u201cJews did not sustain their magnificent civilization because they were anti-anti-Semites,\u201d Weiss sagely observes. There is a growing peril in allowing an imagination of disaster to disorient Jews and obscure their duties and interests in the world beyond mere survival.\n\nIt has been said that Jews must have a bag mentally packed, ready to flee. This paranoia is deeply embedded in the Jewish psyche, and for understandable reasons. Although past generations of Jews could be forgiven for harboring that mental luggage and little else, in fact their achievements proved to be more formidable and enduring; for modern Jews, even while they attend to their perennial fears \u2014 and their fanatical enemies\u2019 designs \u2014 of a world without Jews, it is important also to bear in mind that Hitler is dead, and there is work to be done outside the realm of security. Modern Jewish power has furnished the moral space to advance and vindicate modern Jewish values.\n\nThe peculiar coincidence of great power but also abiding vulnerability demands the acknowledgement, after Jewish fashion, of a rich irony. In his essay \u201cWhy We Remain Jews,\u201d the philosopher Leo Strauss laid great emphasis on the tenuousness of existence as well as the illusion of salvation. He argued that \u201cthe Jewish people and their fate are the living witness for the absence of redemption. This, one could say, is the meaning of the chosen people; the Jews are chosen to prove the absence of redemption.\u201d The absence of redemption should recommend to Jews (and their well-wishers) a vigorous pursuit of self-defense and self-respect that recognizes ultimate security as a mirage.\n\nAs the political center gives way to the ethno-nationalist Right and the anti-colonialist Left, which feed off of and reinforce each other, Weiss and many Jews have begun to ask the breathless question: Could it happen here? Gentiles should by all means join them, though \u201cit\u201d will not be a totalitarian future replete with book burnings and goose-stepping soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division. It is safe to surmise that America remains firmly against that \u201cplot,\u201d even as the erosion of trust in the institutions of free government, at home and abroad, is well under way. If this cycle persists or accelerates, it will be a striking historical anomaly if the Jews do not suffer grievously, though this time their suffering may not be appreciably greater than the rest of ours.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "In the course of a review of The Plot against America,\u00a0Philip Roth\u2019s\u00a0dystopian novel that has the United States adopting a form of Nazi rule after the election of America-Firster Charles Lindbergh,\u00a0the Australian writer Clive James confessed to never quite suspending his disbelief in this lurid alternative", "authors": ["Brian Stewart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ExGvKZT7KzXfmMqOYFYeFA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/11603c29280e36eb9f01a2b071c46e01", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
