The recall involves nearly 2,300 cases and two bulk bins of fresh apples, according to North Bay Produce of Traverse City.\n\nThe recalled apples were shipped between October 16 and October 21 to distributors and retailers in Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin, according to a statement posted Monday by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nApples purchased before October 16 are not part of the recall, and health officials are not aware of any illnesses linked to the recall, the company and FDA said.\n\nThe variety of recalled apples include McIntosh, Honeycrisp, Jonathan, Fuji, Nonamac and Red Delicious, all sold in plastic bags under the brands Great Lakes and North Bay Produce Pure Michigan. The recall also involves apples sold unbranded in clear plastic tote bags, white paper tote bags and individually from retailers' display trays. (See full list below.)\n\nListeria monocytogenes can cause serious and at times fatal infections in the young, frail and elderly, as well as those with weakened immune systems. It can cause short-term symptoms including fever, headache, stiffness and abdominal pain in healthy people, and miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women, the FDA cautioned. The recall was initiated after a test indicated the presence of the organism, prompting the company to stop production at the facility that processed the product.\n\nConsumers were urged not to eat the recalled apples, and are advised to throw them away or return them to the place of purchase. Consumers with questions can call 1-231-929-4001 (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. \u2013 5 p.m. ET), or visit www.northbayproduce.com.\n\nApple recall list", "description": "McIntosh, Honeycrisp, Jonathan and Fuji are among the varieties recalled after test reveals possible contamination", "authors": ["Kate Gibson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/29/36e8dd6f-b685-4bd6-bd5c-82c98e19be4d/thumbnail/1200x630/833a990f8d48f134b14aca66ab9279a0/image-9-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
