Trump\u2019s successful 2016 bid for the Republican nomination a monumental intra-party shift. In one respect, this holds merit. Trump\u2019s unique modus operandi did set him apart, as he gained popularity by neglecting to use a politician\u2019s filter, and \u201ctelling things how they were.\u201d He said (and still says) whatever he wants, whenever he wants. His policy prescriptions, however, do not wield the same pristine originality. In fact, his political orientation resembles that of Patrick J. Buchanan, a wildly influential former Nixon aide (among other accolades), and lifelong \u201cPaleocon.\u201d Paleoconservatism is a political stance that posits the importance of strong borders, economic protectionism, and vehement anti-interventionism. Does this sound familiar? That\u2019s because it\u2019s made a return of Lazarus-scale proportions.\n\nFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This is, of course, an axiom of Newtonian physics \u2014 but also an oddly consistent phenomenon in the political sphere. Moderation and polarization have mirrored each other across party lines for decades, and our current predicament follows suit. The contemporary political scene is one of partisan dipoles in gladiatorial combat, both seeking to reinvent themselves in a time of identity crisis and contention. For the Democrats, this (so far) involves careening towards sinistral madness. Hollow promises of \u201cfree everything!\u201d fused with deafening shrieks for impeachment are just two elements of the Left\u2019s rhetorical cacophony. Even Barack Obama, Messiah not long ago, is an anachronism in the eyes of the emergent radical faction. Obamacare? Why not do away with private insurance altogether, as Senator Warren (D-MA), Senator Sanders (D-VT), and NYC Mayor de Blasio have all suggested? Deportation of illegal immigrants? No, no, Barry, per Julian Castro. That\u2019s how fascists operate a country! In fact, ICE needs to be abolished, pronto, as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asserts.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the mirroring effect mentioned earlier is a clear chicken vs. egg dilemma, one thing arises as certain: the Democratic Party\u2019s leftward skid is being catalyzed in the face of an unfamiliar beast that had been dormant for over forty years pre-Trump \u2014 a refined resurgence of Paleoconservatism headed by the blunt and unapologetic 45th President. The Republican votership has abandoned the failed doctrine of John Bolton and Bill Kristol for a rejuvenated Pat Buchanan-style philosophy. Neoconservatism is in the midst of a long-overdue swan song. Gone are the days of shortsighted yet perpetual intervention; of mindless adherence to globalism under the appeasement guise of Laissez-Faire capitalism; of timid behavior in the face of career liars and charlatans. The time is optimal for conservatives, and all Americans for that matter, to embrace the patriotism, peace, and prosperity that Trump\u2019s distilled Paleoconservatism strives to offer. These are ideals worth protecting, and long-standing pillars of the American identity, all of which serve to combat the dismal dogma of the modern Left.\n\nThe American Left of today is hellbent on monopolizing the past, present, and future. They revise and scrutinize our history, reminding us constantly of our nation\u2019s past moral missteps. Yet, somehow, the present is also worse than ever! Ideologues like Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) tell us that we are currently living under \u201cthe most corrupt president in modern American history.\u201d Not even the future is spared from the Democrats\u2019 doomsday outlook. Remember, if we don\u2019t fork over more of our income, the planet will implode in 12...10...5...1 year(s)! The pigtailed prophet, Greta of Stockholm, warned us! Were Bill Nye\u2019s propaganda clips not enough to sway you stubborn fools? Alas, it\u2019s time to trust the folks who brought you San Francisco and its feces-paved boulevards with saving the planet!\n\nSpare me\u2026 I\u2019d sooner trust Edward Scissorhands to give me a back massage.\n\nThis all-tense-encompassing negativity corrodes our national pride and cohesion, blow by blow. If our Founding Fathers are presented as nothing but racists and subjugators, then why are the nation\u2019s founding documents even worth reading? If our president is a despotic traitor, then why should anyone be satisfied with the present state of affairs? And if our planet is on the brink of catastrophe, then what\u2019s the point of raising children? Aren\u2019t they destined to drown in a tidal surge, or be burned to a crisp by a raging solar flare?\n\nThis is nothing but a coercion effort \u2014 one which the Left hopes will convince us to cede freedoms in exchange for vaguely defined progress, and \u201cdisaster prevention.\u201d President Trump, despite his crude nature and Twitter addiction, offers a fresh brand of Paleoconservatism that lacks the religious sanctimony and fundamentalist undertones of prior decades, countering this power grab in utero. It is a philosophy which allows us to take pride in our country\u2019s history; to recognize and appreciate the timeless values enshrined in our Constitution; to cherish our many freedoms; to realize our potential, and contribute confidently towards our nation\u2019s economic might; to enjoy peace through strength while avoiding costly foreign conflicts; to perhaps create, love, and care for a family without imposed guilt; and finally, to look into the future with wide-eyes and the internal assurance that things will turn out just fine.", "description": "Most people considered Donald J.
