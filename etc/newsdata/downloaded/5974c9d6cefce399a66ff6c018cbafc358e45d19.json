One only need to look at leftist reaction to the El Paso and Dayton shootings last month, both of which took place within 13 hours of each other, to illustrate the point. Because the El Paso shooter was seemingly at least in part motivated by, as Ann Coulter brilliantly noted, the \u201cvital importance of ethnic chauvinism and territorial sovereignty for your own ethnic group\u201d displayed by many immigrant groups, supposed \u2018white nationalism\u2019 is now the greatest threat to America since Nazi armies were plundering Europe, or something.\n\nAs far as Dayton is concerned, why it\u2019s another matter entirely. CNN and the mainstream media in general are careful to hold back, to not attribute a motivation behind a clearly left-wing shooter, and even tried to fact check Trump for using the same tactics they use when it\u2019s a supposedly \u201cright-wing\u201d killer: \u201cPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested a left-wing political motivation behind the massacre in Dayton, Ohio, despite police statements that say there's a lack of a clear motive.\u201d\n\nNote the oh so careful differentiation between the two shootings, lest readers get the impression that leftist ideology can motivate killers too: \u201cIn contrast, investigators say \u2026 the El Paso suspect, left behind a manifesto filled with white supremacist language and racist hatred aimed at immigrants and Latinos.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the tactics media types generally use with criminals even tangentially aligned with right-wing extremism is shockingly deceptive. As I pointed out in this piece I wrote for The Federalist last month, a significant percentage of \u201cextremist violence\u201d examples are simply people, who at some point might have identified with a group or ideology the Southern Poverty Law Center considers extremist, committing a crime that, in many cases, had nothing whatsoever to do with said group or ideology. For example, Joshua Daniel Miller killed a man at his ex-wife\u2019s house during an argument, but still managed to make the ADL\u2019s \u201cMurder and Extremism in the United States in 2018\u201d list because he was \u201cinvolved with militia and Three Percenter groups.\u201d\n\nThe CNN article does acknowledge the truth about the Dayton shooter\u2019s politics, that he \u201cretweeted messages supporting Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as extreme left-wing and anti-police posts, as well as tweets supporting Antifa, or anti-fascist, protesters.\u201d And there were other red flags: The very day of the shooting, the murderer tweeted a post that said, \u201cMillennials have a message for the Joe Biden generation: hurry up and die.\u201d He also at some point wrote, \u201cI want socialism, and I\u2019ll not wait for the idiots to finally come round to understanding\u201d and \u201cThis is America: Guns on every corner, guns in every house, no freedom but that to kill.\u201d He once tweeted \u201cKill every fascist\u201d in response to a story about Charlottesville in 2017.\n\nYet, to CNN, there was \u201cno clear motive behind the attack,\u201d and the killer\u2019s writings \u201cdid not indicate any racial or political motive,\u201d instead pointing to \u201can apparent fixation ... on violence and killing.\u201d Since leftists consider leftism itself to be the very epitome of morality, something else, such as mental illness or another factor, must have caused the Dayton shooter\u2019s killing spree.\n\nWhile I would call leftism as an ideology the exact opposite of any sort of objective morality, I would also agree that the Dayton shooter himself, not leftism, is to blame for his actions. The difference between my position and that of leftists, of course, is that I would use the same logic for the El Paso killings.\n\nNational Review\u2019s Alexandra DeSanctis agrees: \u201cNone of this is to suggest that the shooter\u2019s left-wing sympathies explicitly motivated his massacre, or that the trendy Twitter accounts he followed and the Democratic politicians he supported were in any way culpable for what he did. He was a madman, and only he is personally responsible for his decision to slaughter innocents.\u201d\n\nDeSanctis calls \u201cdeeply grotesque\u201d the \u201crush to attribute responsibility for mass atrocities to one\u2019s political opponents.\u201d But that\u2019s exactly what leftist media and politicians do. Instead of blaming killings on the killers, they want to somehow get inside their heads \u2013 those of the \u2018right\u2019 kind of killers, of course \u2013so they can go after some ideologies while leaving their own intact.\n\nCase in point: Notre Dame professor Ernesto Verdeja called the El Paso shooting a \u201cpolitical terror attack,\u201d but labels attempts to draw similar conclusions about the Dayton shooting \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of a false equivalence \u2014 that one killer is on the right, another killer is on the left, and that the problem is really hateful, divisive discourse from across the political spectrum,\u201d Verdeja said, according to the Los Angeles Times. Then, predictably, Verdeja went on to blame Trump.\n\nIn truth, Elizabeth Warren is no more to blame for the Dayton shooter\u2019s crimes than immigration hawks are responsible for the El Paso killer. To further illustrate the absurdity of the blame game as well as hate crime legislation in general (that\u2019s a whole other column), the majority of the Dayton killer\u2019s victims were actually African American. Would they be any more victimized had the killer engaged in some form of racial discrimination at some point in his life?\n\nShould we counter hateful ideologies on both the left and the right side of the political spectrum with facts, reason, and common sense? Of course. But the Orwellian road we seem to be traveling down, a Minority Report-style \u2018precrime\u2019 nightmare where authorities try to predict and even potentially punish crimes that haven\u2019t even occurred, is one no freedom loving person wants to live in.", "description": "When it comes to the politicization of mass shootings, the .09/09/2019 2:49:49AM EST.", "authors": ["Scott Morefield", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/216/4f78eff4-6f3b-4b6d-850e-2586f00d299a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
