Turbine blades are one of the most critical components of an airplane, determining a jet engine\u2019s safety, power and endurance.\n\nEngineers in China have developed new processes that can make lighter and stronger blades using a hollow structure as well as single-crystal alloys that can withstand high temperatures and a special coating to facilitate cooling. These advances mean Chinese-made turbine blades are able to withstand temperatures several hundred degrees Celsius higher than the melting point of metallic alloys.\n\nRecommended: 5 Places World War III Could Start in 2018\n\nRecommended: How North Korea Could Start a War\n\nRecommended: This Is What Happens if America Nuked North Korea\n\nThese advances are at the center of a possible sale to Germany along with manufacturing equipment that uses lasers to drill ultra-fine holes in turbine blades to keep blades cool by increasing air flow.\n\n\u201cOur machine has outperformed [Germany\u2019s] on some benchmarks,\u201d an anonymous source involved in the negotiations told the South China Morning Post. \u201cThe Germans have seen and grown interested in our technology.\u201d\n\nDiscussions for the sale are still in the early stages, but even the possibility of an agreement with Germany, which created the world\u2019s first production-ready jet engine and has long been revered for its design and manufacturing prowess, is a major victory for China as it seeks to shift its reputation away from cheaply made knockoffs to high-end innovation.\n\nAerospace is one of the key sectors of the \u201cMade In China 2025\u201d initiative, which calls for massive government investment to create thriving self-sufficient domestic industries. But long before the initiative was announced, China has been hard at work developing domestically-produced military aircraft.\n\nIn 2011, China stunned the world with the J-20, the nation\u2019s first stealth fighter meant to rival America\u2019s F-22 Raptor. With the J-20, China became only the second nation after the United States with a tactical stealth jet in service.\n\nJust three years later, China unveiled the J-31 stealth multirole fighter jet, which looks remarkably like the American-made F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Analysts believe the Chinese built the J-31 using stolen F-35 blueprints.\n\nChina\u2019s fifth-generation fighters currently rely on Russian engines, but recent breakthroughs have given the nation the ability to manufacture their own. In September, images revealed China had built a stealth engine for the J-20 equipped with serrated afterburner nozzles and interior flaps to help minimize its radar signature.\n\nAs China turns its attention to commercial airliners, it is only a matter of time before it begins to produce jet engines for commercial use.\n\nIn China\u2019s rapid rise, it has previously turned to German aerospace companies to gain intellectual property and industrial know-how. In 2013, China acquired Germany\u2019s Thielert Aircraft Engines after it filed for bankruptcy. The agreement included Thielert\u2019s technology as well as their manufacturing facilities and equipment.\n\nMore recently, China has set its sights on purchasing Cotesa, an innovative German aerospace manufacturer that supplies parts for Airbus and Boeing. But the deal is currently on hold pending a review by the German government under new rules that grant the state more authority to block foreign takeovers.\n\nThe rules were passed in the midst of growing concerns of Chinese companies acquiring German and other EU companies operating in sensitive industries like aerospace, robotics and computer chips.\n\nChina\u2019s plan to supply Germany with jet engine turbine blade technology is likely to face similar hurdles as Germany partners with Pratt & Whitney, General Electric and other American engine manufacturers. Even if German authorities approve the deal, the sale could still be blocked by the U.S. government which considers jet engine manufacturers as strategic domestic companies.\n\nRegardless of whether this deal succeeds or not, it is apparent that China is quickly becoming an elite player in the Jet Age.\n\nEugene K.
