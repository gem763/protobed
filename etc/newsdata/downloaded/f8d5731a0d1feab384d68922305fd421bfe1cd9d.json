The 19st prop forward's first international try exemplified the team's spirited victory.\n\nKyle Sinckler breaks clear to score England's third try during Rugby World Cup 2019 Quarter Final match between England and Australia\n\nSinckler holds off Australian player Kurtley Beale as he touches down to score his team's third try\n\nA young Sinckler pictured with his mother, Donna Sinckler in an old family photo. Of the mother who raised him singlehandedly, he said: 'I saw her in the crowd. She was pretty emotional. It's been a long, long journey for me and her'\n\nBall clamped to his side, determination etched on his face, the 26-year-old powered over the line. Afterwards, he lay on the ball, arms outstretched in celebration. 'It was very special,' he said later.\n\nAnd of the mother who raised him singlehandedly, he said: 'I saw her in the crowd. She was pretty emotional. It's been a long, long journey for me and her.'\n\nMuch of the credit for England's success has gone to coach Eddie Jones \u2013 who admiringly likened Kyle to a runaway rhino, but as his star player observed: 'You think Eddie's a tough taskmaster? Mama Sinckler, mate. I tell you, she put me in my place.'\n\nProfiles of Kyle frequently suggest he could easily have fallen into a life of crime. The truth is that Donna \u2013 who Kyle says 'made me the person I am today' \u2013 would have never let it happen.\n\nOf his background, Kyle once said: 'On the estate there was that sort of [gang-related] environment.\n\n'But those guys respected me because they knew I was trying to be the best I could be with rugby and I just let them get on with whatever they were doing. My mum always taught me to stay clear of trouble and surround myself with positive people.\n\n'I worked hard, found a love for rugby and did my schoolwork to keep mum happy.'\n\nSinckler celebrates after scoring a try during the Rugby World Cup quarter-final match\n\nSinckler as an 8-year-old boy playing for Battersea Ironsides\n\nIn a recent magazine article he spoke of 'one guy from school... and only the other day he died. He opened his front door, got shot in the face. It's just crazy. If you surround yourself with the wrong kind of people, you can go down a very bad path.'\n\nKyle's quarter-final try in Japan followed a brace from winger Jonny May, who had been given the honour of leading England out at the Oita Stadium to mark his 50th international cap.\n\nAnthony Watson added a fourth try, with captain Owen Farrell kicking 20 points.\n\nEarlier, Kyle, who has a reputation for having a short fuse, resisted Australian efforts to bait him. After conceding an early penalty, he turned away when Australia's Tolu Latu patted him on the head.\n\n'That's something I've really tried to own... my discipline and just being cool in the moment,' said Kyle afterwards.\n\nAbout 20,000 white-shirted England fans descended on the southern Japanese city of Oita in the hope of seeing their team extract revenge for the defeat to Australia four years ago that dumped them out of the tournament on home ground. This time round, a rousing rendition of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot, heralded celebrations in bars and ramen shops.\n\nThe 24-point margin of victory \u2013 England's biggest in a World Cup knockout game \u2013 raised hopes of a famous victory next Saturday, although the All Blacks looked ominous during their 46-14 thrashing of Ireland.", "description": "The mother of England Rugby player Kyle Sickler could feel justifiable satisfaction after he steamrolled through flailing Australians like a 'runaway rhino' to score a vital try for his team on Saturday.", "authors": ["Ian Gallagher", "Jonathan Bucks For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19937516-0-image-a-8_1571519567648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
