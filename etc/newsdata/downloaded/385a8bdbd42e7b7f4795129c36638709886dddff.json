The regionals were stuck with average risk weights of 35 per cent.\n\nOver the past month, the regional banks have stepped up their lobbying of government to have risk weightings changed for banks using the standardised approach. The regionals have lobbied Frydenberg\u2019s office, Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nAt the top of their list of complaints is risk weights on mortgages. They claim the risk weight on a low risk loan offered by a major bank can be as low as 5 per cent, compared to 35 per cent for a standardised bank.\n\nThe regionals claim APRA\u2019s proposed changes to risk weights, which is part of the implementation of another FSI recommendation that our banks be \u201cunquestionably strong\u201d, will result in the lowest risk weight for a standardised bank of 20 per cent.\n\nThere is no indication that APRA will alter its existing position in relation to regional banks.\n\nAPRA is conducting a multi-year consultation for these proposed changes to risk weights with a start date of January 1, 2022.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of APRA\u2019s first round of consultations on risk weight changes, there is no indication that APRA will alter its existing position in relation to regional banks.\n\nAPRA has recently done some analysis to quantify the impact of the capital difference between the advanced and simpler approaches for residential mortgages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe regulator estimated that the difference in the current cost of writing a mortgage because of differences in regulatory capital requirements was about 5 basis points. Also, it does not expect this to change materially under the proposed reforms.\n\nAs part of APRA\u2019s reforms and in line with international proposals, APRA is proposing to limit the capital benefit that advanced banks can obtain relative to all other banks.\n\nBut the regional banks are not convinced their customers will be better off.\n\nAs one regional banker told Chanticleer: \u201cIf I think about your standard mortgage, where the bulk of the business is, and you have two individuals in their 30s or 40s who are both employed and want a mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio of 80 or less, the differential between a regional bank and the majors should be very little because basically that risk is the same for both of us.\n\n\u201cBut the majors can actually spread the risk weights across their whole book and on the very low risk ones they could be holding capital as low as five per cent. It means that your standard, what I would call low risk mortgages, will more likely drift to the majors and we're left with the more non-standard mortgages which doesn\u2019t seem the right way around.\u201d", "description": "Not much has happened in the four years since the Turnbull government agreed to improve competition between the big four and regional banks.
