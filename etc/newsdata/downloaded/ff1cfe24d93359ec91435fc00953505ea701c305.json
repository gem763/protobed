REUTERS/Louis Nastro/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Virgin Atlantic is hoping to add over 80 new routes to its network after a third runway is built at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport including short-haul and domestic flights, the British airline said on Wednesday.\n\nHeathrow\u2019s expansion is due for completion in 2026 after lawmakers voted strongly in favour of the third runway in June 2018, although environmentalists and local groups are challenging the plans in court.\n\nVirgin Atlantic said it could serve up to 84 new locations from the expanded airport compared to its current 19.\n\nThe plans would depend on Britain changing how it allocates slots to airlines. Currently Heathrow is dominated by British Airways owner IAG but rules governing the allocation of slots are under review by the government.\n\n\u201cHeathrow has been dominated by one airline group for far too long,\u201d said Shai Weiss, chief executive at Virgin Atlantic.\n\n\u201cThe third runway is a once in a lifetime opportunity to change the status quo and create a second flag-carrier,\u201d he added in a statement. \u201cThis would lower fares and give real choice to passengers.\u201d\n\nIAG holds more than 55% of take-off and landing slots at Heathrow, with no other airline holding more than 5% of the remainder, Virgin Atlantic said.\n\nThe airline, part of Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Group, currently operates long-haul routes to destinations such as New York, San Francisco, Johannesburg and Hong Kong.\n\nBut under the plans, it would add domestic routes such as Liverpool and Edinburgh, short-haul flights to Germany, Spain and France as well as long-haul flights to cities such as Jakarta and Panama City.", "description": "Virgin Atlantic is hoping to add over 80 new routes to its network after a third runway is built at London's Heathrow Airport including short-haul and domestic flights, the British airline said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1431013689&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G20Z", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
