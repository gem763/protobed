California wineries, already battling tough global competitors, rising costs and labour shortages, are increasingly fearful the US-China trade war will exact irreversible damage after years of cultivating China's market as carefully as their vines.\n\n\"California wine exporters are worried they may never be able to recover market share in China,\" said Jock O'Connell, international trade adviser with Beacon Economics, \"which they naturally have long seen as a huge opportunity for profit.\"\n\nMerlot grapes being harvested in California.

The Golden State accounts for some 95 per cent of US wine production and exports, with China sales set to hit US$30 million this year, down from US$78.7 million in 2017.\n\nEven as Chinese taxes and punitive tariffs on US wine have doubled to 98 per cent, a free-trade agreement Australia signed with Beijing has given that country tariff-free access to China's giant market.\n\nWine is hardly the only California agricultural export suffering a hangover. California almond exports have fallen by a third and US dairy exports, another major California product, fell 54 per cent in the first half of 2019.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has handed out subsidies to compensate farmers for economic harm resulting from the trade war, some here say they are disadvantaged relative to Republican-leaning Midwestern wheat and soy farmers.\n\nAccording to US Department of Agriculture data acquired by Associated Press, California has received some US$76.3 million in federal subsidies, a fraction of the US$8.5 billion doled out nationwide, despite being the nation's top agricultural exporter.\n\n\"We all get penalised on an equal percentage, but relief goes to other farmers,\" said Pete Przybylinski, Duckhorn Portfolio's senior vice-president of sales and strategy. \"Trump is no big fan of California, so the likelihood of him helping us was very small.\"\n\nAdding to frustration among wineries is concern that the trans-Pacific chest thumping hit just when years of hard work were starting to pay off. Their fear: growing suspicion of US brands will shape lifelong habits among Chinese consumers at a time when many are taking their first sip.\n\nDuckhorn started selling to China in 2006, gradually growing its customer base and learning the market. But at Shanghai's ProWine trade conference in late 2018, an attendee shouted that he would never buy California wine given his dislike of Trump, Przybylinski said. \"That was a year ago. You can imagine what it's like now.\"", "description": "Dylan Wang and Sherry Duan hold their glasses up to the light before tasting the Atlas Peak merlot and Howell Mountain cabernet at Duckhorn Winery's tasting room, overlooking acres of ripe grapes.Wang, 39, an investment fund manager, and Duan, a 32-year-old lawyer, came here to California's famed", "authors": ["Mark Magnier"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Q1wMUZSzfEpEuHfZvz0PXg--~B/aD01NDg7dz05NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_us_228/7dc068e436ffd2fe62ac145f4e2a3baf", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
