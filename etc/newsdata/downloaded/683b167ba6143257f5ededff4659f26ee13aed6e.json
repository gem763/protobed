After Epstein committed suicide in federal prison last month, the business columnist James Stewart wrote in the Times that Epstein had once asked Stewart if he wanted to have dinner with him and Allen. (Allen\u2019s publicist didn\u2019t respond to Stewart or to my request for comment.) These reports and allegations\u2014of older men preying on underage girls\u2014swirled together in the media ether and the public imagination. The journalist Richard Morgan read through 56 boxes of Allen\u2019s personal archive in a Princeton library and said the through line was Allen\u2019s \u201cvivid obsession with young women and girls.\u201d\n\nAnd so there wasn\u2019t exactly an air of samizdat intrigue around the sold-out Paris premiere, which was organized by a Woody Allen fan club at the Christine 21, a theater run by the actress Isabelle Huppert\u2019s partner and their son. But the fact that this movie, at turns charming, banal, and problematic, could become subversive simply by being screened tells you something about the disparate cultural moments in America and in France.\n\nSo far, everyone\u2019s playing to type. America\u2014that is, Amazon\u2014in its righteous moral stance (a stance rife with hypocrisy, though; Amazon won\u2019t distribute A Rainy Day but still sells Allen\u2019s DVDs and streams some of his films on Amazon Prime). France in its cult of the auteur, its ambivalence about #MeToo, its total commitment to free artistic expression, its high-minded belief that the art transcends the artist. And Allen in his tendency to produce hollow, throwback, pre-feminist-movement fantasies.\n\nRead: France, where #MeToo becomes #PasMoi\n\nChalamet stars in the film as Gatsby\u2014get it?\u2014a rich Upper East Side kid who plays poker and piano, and has been sent upstate to college by his parents. There, he\u2019s taken up with Ashleigh (Fanning), an excitable blonde and aspiring journalist from Arizona. Ashleigh lands an interview for the school paper with one of her idols, the film director Roland Pollard (Liev Schreiber, in sunglasses), and guess what? The interview will take place in Manhattan! Fanning is all exclamation points in this film. She overacts her underwritten role, as if in a permanent state of OMG OMG OMG.\n\nThe young couple boards a Greyhound bus to the city, where Gatsby has booked them a hotel suite overlooking Central Park with $20,000 he\u2019s won at poker. What American audiences will really miss out on in A Rainy Day is Chalamet. His wordless scene in Luca Guadagnino\u2019s Call Me By Your Name marked the arrival of a star, and as Gatsby, Chalamet is far more interesting to watch than anyone else in the film. He seems to be analyzing his role while playing it and also creates the only moment in the film with genuine emotion, even beauty, when he sings the old Chet Baker standard Everything Happens to Me at the piano.", "description": "The Paris premiere of A Rainy Day in New York highlighted the tension between American morality and France\u2019s high-minded belief that the art transcends the artist.", "authors": ["Rachel Donadio"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_17319075188424/facebook.jpg?1569349033", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
