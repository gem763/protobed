Hernandez, 41, faces from five years to life in prison.\n\nThe US government argued that Hernandez was a large-scale drug trafficker who worked from 2004 to 2016 with others in Colombia, Honduras and Mexico to import cocaine into the US by plane, boat and submarine.\n\nThe prosecution also said Hernandez, who served as a member of the Honduran Congress from 2014 to 2018, was involved in at least two murders of rival drug traffickers in 2011 and 2013.\n\nSome of the cocaine he was transporting was labeled with his initials \"TH,\" prosecutors argued.\n\nThe trial also featured compromising allegations against the president himself.\n\nThe prosecution claimed that several candidates from Honduras' ruling National Party accepted campaign funding from Tony Hernandez, including former president Porfirio Lobo and the current president, who was elected first in 2013 and again in contested elections in 2017.\n\nThe Manhattan prosecutor's office filed a motion in August alleging that President Hernandez received at least $1.5 million in drug money from one of the prosecution's cooperating witnesses for his first campaign, and $40,000 for the second.\n\nPresident Hernandez and Lobo have both rejected the accusations, and neither has been formally charged by the US judicial system.\n\nThe high-profile trial lasted just under two weeks.\n\nUS prosecutors have aggressively pursued current or former Honduran public officials and their relatives over drug trafficking allegations.\n\nThe verdict comes after Mexican kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, the 62-year-old former co-leader of Mexico's feared Sinaloa drug cartel, was convicted in New York in February of smuggling hundreds of tons of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and marijuana into the United States.\n\nHe has been jailed for life, a sentence he is appealing.", "description": "A New York court found the brother of the president of Honduras guilty of drug trafficking Friday, in a blow to the leader of the Central American country.
