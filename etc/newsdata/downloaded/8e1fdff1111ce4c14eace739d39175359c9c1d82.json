It will be interesting to continue to watch the impact of WeWork on the New York real estate market. In NYC and London, WeWork is the largest private sector office tenant. What would it mean for the city's commercial real estate market if WeWork were to go away?\n\nReaders, would love to hear your thoughts!\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nOlivia\n\nWe talked to 24 people about the hedge-fund wunderkind at Elliott who wants to shake up AT&T. Here's why management should be terrified.\n\nThe latest campaign for the Wall Street hedge fund Elliott Management is a big one, taking on the well-known American staple AT&T.\n\nThe man in charge of pushing the massive company to make the changes the $38 billion fund sees fit is 39-year-old Jesse Cohn, the billionaire Paul Singer's right-hand man.\n\nOther than Singer himself, Cohn is the person most responsible for the transformation of Elliott from a distressed-situations specialist to the sprawling institutional behemoth it is today, with a separate private-equity arm and billions ready to be deployed for a new activist campaign.\n\nCohn's tactics have included shrewdness and aggression in the 100-plus campaigns the Long Island, New York, native has run for Singer. Business Insider talked to more than two dozen of his colleagues, competitors, detractors, and friends, who said Elliott's rise mimicked Cohn's own personal rise in the firm and in corporate America.\n\nREAD MORE HERE \u00bb\n\nBlueMountain is shuttering its flagship hedge fund, and cofounder Stephen Siderow is leaving. The struggling firm will be almost entirely out of the hedge-fund game.\n\nBlueMountain is winding down its 16-year-old flagship fund, the $2.5 billion BlueMountain Credit Alternatives Fund, to focus on its collateralized-loan-obligations business for its new corporate owner, Assured Guaranty.\n\nBlueMountain cofounder Stephen Siderow will also leave the firm at the end of the year, the firm said in a statement.\n\nThe manager, which just a year ago was running several different hedge-fund strategies, has pulled back from the space in just 10 months.\n\nREAD MORE HERE \u00bb\n\nJPMorgan has a complex relationship with WeWork. Here's a sneak peak at what Wall Street analysts will be asking when it reports earnings.\n\nEarnings season for big banks kicks off next Tuesday, with JPMorgan among the firms turning in third-quarter results.\n\nJPMorgan has worked with WeWork and its co-founder Adam Neumann in several capacities, including would-be lead underwriter on a recently failed IPO.\n\nNo analysts we talked to called out specific expectations for JPMorgan writedowns on WeWork. Some said questions about the IPO are expected given its high profile.\n\nWeWork-related topics that could draw attention include JPMorgan's lending situation with the company, and how it's valuing WeWork investments. Other issues like rate cuts and net interest income are also in the spotlight. .\n\nREAD MORE HERE \u00bb\n\nMeet 2019's Rising Stars of Wall Street shaking up investing, trading, and dealmaking\n\nMeet the 2019 class of Wall Street's rising stars.
