Find Aniah,\" while another added \"I hope they find her soon and pray for her.\"\n\nHarris, who is nicknamed the Big Ticket, has been professional since 2011, and his professional mixed martial arts record stands at 13 wins and seven losses.", "description": "The 19-year-old has not been heard from since Wednesday and her car was discovered on Friday in Montgomery, Alabama", "authors": ["Alex Milne"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20746459.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Aniah-Blanchard-31.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
