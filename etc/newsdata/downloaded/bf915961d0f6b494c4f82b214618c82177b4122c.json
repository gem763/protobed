In 2005, when John Evans, the American ambassador to Armenia, said that \u201cthe Armenian genocide was the first genocide of the 20th century,\u201d he was recalled and forced into early retirement. Stating the truth was seen as an act of subordination.\n\nWhen I became ambassador to the United Nations in 2013, I worried that I would be asked about the Armenian genocide and that when I affirmed the historical facts, I could cause a diplomatic rupture.\n\nSecond, when bullies feel their tactics are working, they generally bully more \u2014 a lesson worth bearing in mind in responding to threats from China and Saudi Arabia. The Turkish government devotes millions of dollars annually to lobbying American officials and lawmakers: more than $12 million during the Obama administration, and almost as much during the first two years of the Trump presidency. Turkish officials and lobbyists have threatened to respond to genocide recognition by suspending lucrative financial ties with American companies and even preventing resupply of our troops in Iraq.\n\nOn Friday, the Turkish ambassador warned that passage of the \u201cbiased\u201d House resolution would \u201cpoison\u201d American-Turkish relations, and implied that it would jeopardize Turkish investment in the United States which provides jobs for a \u201cconsiderable number of American citizens.\u201d\n\nIt is easy to understand why any commander in chief would be leery of damaging ties with Turkey, an important ally in a turbulent neighborhood. But Turkey has far more to lose than the United States in the relationship. The United States helped build up Turkey\u2019s military, brought it into NATO and led the coalition that defeated the Islamic State, which carried out dozens of attacks on Turkish soil. Over the past five years, American companies have invested some $20 billion in Turkey.\n\nIf Mr. Erdogan turns further away from a relationship that has been immensely beneficial for Turkey in favor of deepening ties with Russia or China, it will not be because the House voted to recognize the Armenian genocide. It will be because his own repressive tactics are coming to resemble those of the Russian and Chinese leaders.", "description": "For too long, Turkey bullied America into silence.
