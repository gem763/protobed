Henry Slade is set to play a bigger role providing there are no after-effects from the bang to the knee he took in Sapporo, while the likes of Lewis Ludlam, Piers Francis and Joe Cokanasiga are expected to come into the matchday squad.\n\nYet flanker Sam Underhill, lock Courtney Lawes and fly-half George Ford could all be asked to go again after being replaced early in the second half against Tonga, while props Joe Marler and Dan Cole will have to feature in some capacity due to the lack of alternatives \u2013 though Jones is likely to swap in Ellis Genge and Dan Cole to start.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Though his side maintained control of the game for the entire 80 minutes, they struggled to take their chances as chance after chance went begging \u2013 Underhill and Ben Youngs both being held up over the line while Slade and Elliot Daly butchered a late opportunity through miscommunication.\n\nIt left England chasing the bonus-point try until the 77th minute, with replacements Jonathan Joseph and Luke Cowan-Dickie combining to ease English nerves and secure a maximum haul of five points. But Jones believes that is all he could ask from his team, given he would be concerned if they were peaking now.\n\nAsked if he wants his side to peak towards the end of the pool stage \u2013 when England play Argentina and then France \u2013 Jones responded: \u201c100 per cent that\u2019s part of the plan. The closer we get to Tokyo, the more important the games are, but the next most important game is the USA so that is the only thing we are focusing on.\n\n\u201c\u201cLook, the World Cup is about building up, about progressing. There is a certain game at the end of the tournament that we would like to be in and we want to be at our best in that game. Along the way you have to keep improving.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the win. We came to Sapporo and we wanted five points. We have got everyone fit, we have got no tries on the board for two games in a row, we couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\n\nJones put a lot of England\u2019s late fighting spirit to seal the bonus point down to an inspiring visit from Sir Alex Ferguson in the summer, with the former Manchester United manager making an unexpected trip to Bristol to give the squad a pep talk after Jones announced the final 31-man squad in mid-August.\n\n\u201cWhenever you get great people in they make an impact,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you pick up one or two things. And that particularly resonated with me more so. I\u2019m sure the players picked up on it. They\u2019re just little tidbits of advice that help.\n\n\u201cNaturally there\u2019s some urgency about what you want to do. But the fact is you don\u2019t need to do anything different. You\u2019ve got to be patient and just do the simple things over and over again. That showed today.\u201d\n\nThat was apparent in the way that England ground their way to a bonus point, and lock Maro Itoje \u2013 who could well be one of those rested for Thursday\u2019s match \u2013 echoed his coach\u2019s thoughts on Ferguson\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cSometimes when you hear of and see figures when you are growing up, they almost don\u2019t feel real,\u201d Itoje said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell us when he was coming in, so he walked into the room and everyone almost swallowed some spit. It was: \u2018it\u2019s actually him\u2019.\n\n\u201cJust being able to meet him and talk to him \u2013 the stories he had were amazing. I think we took a lot out of it.\n\n\u201cA lot of the time when the pressure\u2019s on \u2013 with Fergietime - he [Fergie] said: \u2018Don\u2019t shoot. When the pressure\u2019s on, don\u2019t shoot, you\u2019ll find a way to get into a better scoring position\u2019. He didn\u2019t like guys shooting from outside the box when the pressure is on.\n\n\u201cI think we can take a lot out of that. When the pressure is on, it\u2019s not about the elaborate play, it\u2019s not about the 50-50; it\u2019s about doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cI am an Arsenal fan, so he made me cry a few times in my life!
