REUTERS/Stringer\n\nCuliacan\u2019s central Tres Rios neighbourhood, with its gated communities, upscale shopping centres and exclusive golf course, was victim to some of the most intense firefights last Thursday, concentrated on the street where soldiers attempted to arrest Ovidio Guzman, a son of jailed drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman.\n\nWhile El Chapo\u2019s Sinaloa Cartel successfully pinched off access at various points in the city, they trained their focus on Tres Rios, where Ovidio Guzman was briefly found and detained, but later released after officials realized they were outmatched.\n\nMexico\u2019s foreign minister admitted on Saturday that the government feared upwards of 200 civilian casualties if the operation to extract the young narco had continued.\n\nJust off the entrance of a Tres Rios seafood restaurant that found itself at the heart of the hours-long siege, workers scrubbed away dried blood from the steps.\n\nThey said the spot marked the final resting place of a cartel gunman following what officials described as 14 separate, armed attacks launched by the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s convoys of pickup trucks against Mexico\u2019s overwhelmed military at different points in the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a struggle to open back up, but we have to do it,\u201d said the restaurant\u2019s owner, declining to provide his name, but ticking off his immediate priorities: \u201csweeping up the debris, cleaning up everything and calling for help to repair the damages.\u201d\n\nAs workers assessed the few windows that had not been pierced by the flurry of bullets, the owner acknowledged it will take time to lure customers back.\n\n\u201cRight now, everyone here is in a state of panic, but Tres Rios will still be the best part of Culiacan,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, workers at the car wash next door to the restaurant focused on repairing metal vacuum cleaners ripped open by bullets.\n\nUpon finding out that authorities sought to capture Ovidio Guzman and extradite him to the United States, the cartel\u2019s heavily armed gunmen strategically erected 19 blockades during a roughly four-hour stretch in the afternoon, preventing additional military and police from responding as terrorized locals scurried for cover.\n\nOne of the most intense firefights took place on the block behind the restaurant where local residents said several military vehicles had stopped along a non-descript building with tall, white walls, in a bid to extract El Chapo\u2019s son from a residence inside.\n\nNow the walls stood covered with hundreds of bullet holes, as if the building had broken out in a rash.\n\nThe soldiers in the vehicles came under heavy fire from a hill across an adjacent drainage canal, separating Tres Rios from the Tierra Blanca residential neighbourhood, and several homes there were caught in the crossfire.\n\n\u201cThey destroyed my bedroom windows. The walls, they\u2019re filled with bullet holes,\u201d said taxi driver Jose Manuel Uriarte, whose home is located just below the hill where he said gunmen had taken up positions to fire upon the military vehicles.\n\nHe pointed out, with fingers stained with paint from the repairs he had started, where his mattress had been covered by a blanket of broken glass.\n\nAn avocado tree in the lush garden outside his bedroom had been split open by the gunfire and Uriarte estimated that he had already found around 500 bullet casings nearby.\n\nHe spotted another on the ground, squatted down to pick it up and then handed it over like it was a souvenir.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nLike other locals, he wonders about the possible infiltration of the cartel into local and state police, but said there is no doubt that the cartel proved itself to be the stronger force, at least for one violent afternoon last week.\n\nAnd then his face turned angry and he pursed his lips.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s infuriating,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you have to ask yourself, \u2018Who\u2019s really in charge?\u2019\u201d", "description": "The trendy bars and restaurants along the main strip of the Mexican city overwhelmed late last week by an army of cartel gunmen slowly began their recovery over the weekend even as many traumatized residents still shied away.", "authors": ["David Alire Garcia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443126428&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0PQ", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
