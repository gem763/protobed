He was 79. New Yorker reporter Jane Mayer first tweeted news of his death on Friday morning. Details of his death are not yet known, but it\u2019s been reported that the younger Koch brother had been in poor health.\n\nLast year Koch had stepped away from his role at Koch Industries, the multinational corporation run by his older brother Charles in Kansas. He also left the board of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, a conservative political advocacy group funded by the Koch brothers.\n\nAccording to Forbes, David Koch was the 11th richest man in the world with a net worth of some $42 billion. But despite holding leadership roles at the massive global conglomerate Koch Industries, David was best known for his political activism supporting conservative and libertarian policies since the 1980s. He\u2019s used his billions throughout the years to support policies, foundations, and think tanks that promote small government and free market ideals.\n\nKoch himself launched an unsuccessful bid in 1980 for Vice President on the Libertarian Party ticket as running mate with Ed Clark. They received roughly 1% of the vote. Koch has been targeted by Democratic politicians like President Obama for his involvement in politics, accusing Koch of buying elections and having too much influence on American policy and legislation.\n\nAhead of 2018\u2019s midterm elections Koch aides pledged to spend an eye-popping $400 million to help secure victory for Republicans, including a $20 million pledge to shore up support for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nDavid Koch was also known for his philanthropy, with the brothers donating over $1 billion throughout the years to causes including medical research, higher education, and public television, among other initiatives. In 2014, Koch pledged to donate $1 million to the September 11 Memorial and Museum.\n\nBusinessman David Koch arrives at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala Benefit celebrating the opening of \"Charles James: Beyond Fashion\" in Upper Manhattan, New York May 5, 2014.

And it\u2019s not just the size of the company, I think, that makes it important; it\u2019s the scope of what it does.\u201d\n\nWith a valuation of roughly $140 billion, the sprawling conglomerate controls subsidiaries in the manufacturing, refining, and distribution of various energy resources, such as petroleum and chemicals. Its prodigious reach has ensured that, for nearly four decades, Koch Industries has entered the lives of countless Americans.\n\n\u201cThis company specializes in the kind of stuff that underpins civilization,\u201d said Leonard. \u201cFuel, fertilizer, building materials; it really touches everybody\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nAn entrepreneurial spirit\n\nBorn in 1940 in Wichita, Kansas, David is the third of four sons born to Fred C. Koch and his wife Mary. He followed in his father\u2019s footsteps, becoming an engineer, earning both a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He joined Koch Industries under his older brother Charles in 1970, opening their New York office and later becoming president of its engineering division.\n\nBoth David and Charles Koch \u2013 known colloquially as the Koch brothers \u2013 shared an entrepreneurial spirit, fostered by their father, after whom the company is named.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about the business and how it became what it is today, this is a company that, back in even the \u201870s and \u201880s, realized the most important resource they dealt with wasn\u2019t gas, or coal, or cattle \u2013 it was information,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThis is a company that\u2019s big into trading, and their strategy is to try to know more about the world than their competitors and to trade on that advantage.\u201d", "description": "Billionaire industrialist David Koch has died at 79.", "authors": ["Kristin Myers"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FZ_B2TNoDGDeoQjQDzuShg--~B/aD0xODM2O3c9Mjc0MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/decd24a0-c5a6-11e9-bd37-debf3ebe9622", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
