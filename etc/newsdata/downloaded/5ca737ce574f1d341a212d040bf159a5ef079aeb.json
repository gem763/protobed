However, the cancellation means England will now top the group, with France second. Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals.\n\nWhen is it?\n\nIt would have been played on Saturday, October 12, at 9.15am in Yokohama.\n\nWhy has it been cancelled?\n\nDue to the approach of Super Typhoon Hagibis on one of the most extraordinary days in 32 years of World Cup history.\n\nEach team will take two points from the abandoned Pool C showdown at International Stadium Yokohama. New Zealand's encounter against Italy in Toyota City has shared the same fate.\n\nStill under review, however, is the critical meeting between Scotland and Japan which is also being staged in Yokohama.\n\nIf that game does not go ahead, the Scots will be automatically eliminated while the tournament hosts reach the quarter-finals for the first time. The Scottish Rugby Union has released a statement demanding the match be played under contingency plans.", "description": "What is it?", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Paul Hayward", "Mick Cleary"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212571670-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bquhm-8k55P1cg4FdiiMqgFsovQcNMm2OzFoz8CWWJ9-Q.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
