But it has now relaxed its requirements in a bid to boost numbers.\n\nOne UTC has begun taking students from age 11 and two more are set to change from 2020-21.\n\nAltering the entry age is likely to help recruitment but it is unclear at this stage whether it will be enough to keep many struggling UTCs afloat.\n\nUltimately, parents and students need to believe that technical education will be regarded as being on par with academic education before they take the gamble and opt for a more specialist route.\n\nThe government is hoping to beat Germany in technical education provision in just 10 years but the NAO findings on UTCs show just how far they still have to go.", "description": "Hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent on specialist free schools that prioritise technical education since 2010, and yet the majority of them are still struggling to attract enough students. The latest report from the National Audit Office reveals that nearly three in five of the University Technical Colleges (UTCs) that are still open are operating at less than half", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/23/16/apprentice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
