Others point them downwards to ensure they don't slice off a finger when it comes to unloading, which is actually pretty wise now we think about it.\n\nOthers throw it all in with cutlery going both ways. We call those people psychopaths.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nBut Ashley has finally given us a definitive answer, and much like the Jay Sean classic, it's down, down, down.\n\nAlthough he admits there are valid arguments for cutlery facing both ways, he believes there are three main reasons why down is king.\n\nThe first, as mentioned above, is safety. There's no point ruining your clean utensils by bleeding all over them because you stabbed yourself with an upward-facing knife.\n\nThe second is that it makes unloading the dishwasher easier at the end, with the handles ready to be grabbed and thrown into the cutlery drawer.\n\nAnd finally, it means fewer germs and smudges. Facing them up means your grabbing the eating ends, treating everyone to a few of your hand germs the next time they tuck into a meal.\n\nAshley explains: \"Your fingers are covered in germs and bacteria, so obviously you want to minimise touching any surface that's going to come into contact with your food if you can.\n\n\"On a more benign level, your fingers could also leave smudges on the shiny blades of knives, which isn't a good look if you have guests over.\"\n\nBut what of our argument that facing up gives the knives, forks and spoons a better clean?\n\nAshley admits that although this may be true, the difference is marginal and certainly 'not worth the risk of injury'.\n\nSo there we go. Finally an answer to the most debated question on the planet.", "description": "Choice expert Ashley Iredale has finally settled a major dishwasher debate", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13584570.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Woman-unloading-dishwasher-in-kitchen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
