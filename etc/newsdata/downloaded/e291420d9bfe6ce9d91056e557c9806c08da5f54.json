Ilhan Omar accused President Trump on Wednesday of endangering her life by \u201ccontinuing to spread lies\u201d that she \u201cpartied\u201d on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\nTrump shared a since-deleted tweet on Wednesday morning that purported to show the Minnesota congresswoman dancing to hip-hop star Lizzo\u2019s hit song \u201cTruth Hurts.\u201d Terrence K. Williams, a conservative actor and comedian who posted the video, misled his followers by saying the footage was shot on the 18th anniversary of the attacks.\n\nPresident Trump and Rep. Ilhan Omar.

She said the organization \u201cwas founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\u201d\n\nThe New York Post lambasted Omar\u2019s \u201cSome people did something\u201d phrasing, and Trump tweeted a selectively edited video of Omar\u2019s remarks spliced together with footage of the Sept. 11 attacks. Supporters of Omar condemned the president\u2019s actions as Islamophobic and noted that the congresswoman required heightened security after the tweet\u2019s circulation.\n\nIn his retweet of the post by Williams, who thanked the president for sharing his video, Trump said, \u201cIlhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!\u201d Trump has attacked the freshman lawmakers often in recent months, telling the women to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d The group consists of four Democratic congresswomen: Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts.\n\nOmar said the video of her dancing was taken during the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) Foundation\u2019s Annual Legislative Conference, which took place Sept. 11-15 in Washington, D.C. Original video shows Omar dancing at the conference reception on Sept. 13.\n\n\u201cThis is from a CBC event we hosted this weekend to celebrate black women in Congress,\u201d she wrote, responding to Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cThe President of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk. What is Twitter doing to combat this misinformation?\u201d\n\nA few days earlier Omar defended herself against criticisms from a family member of a 9/11 victim who during a memorial reading of victims\u2019 names at Ground Zero called out her controversial remarks.\n\n\u201c9/11 was an attack on all Americans,\u201d Omar, one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cIt was an attack on all of us, and I certainly could not understand the weight of the pain that the families of the victims of 9/11 must feel.\n\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s important for us to make sure that we are not forgetting the aftermath of 9/11,\u201d she added. \u201cMany Americans found themselves now having their civil rights stripped from them, and so what I was speaking to was that as a Muslim, not only was I suffering as an American who was attacked on that day, but the next day I woke up as my fellow Americans were now treating me as suspect.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Rep.
