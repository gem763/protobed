Ron Johnson Loses It on \u2018Meet the Press\u2019: I Do Not Trust the FBI or CIA", "language": "en", "text": "In an extremely contentious and heated interview with Meet the Press anchor Chuck Todd on Sunday, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) declared that he does not trust the CIA or FBI while launching into a series of conspiratorial attacks on Democrats and intelligence officials regarding the Ukraine scandal.\n\nJohnson\u2014who last week said he was told about a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian investigation into the 2016 election and that President Trump blocked him from telling Ukraine military aid was coming\u2014immediately began his interview on the defensive, complaining that Todd was biased and the president was being sabotaged.\n\nThe Republican senator then proceeded to accuse former members of the FBI and CIA of conspiring to set up the president after his election, claiming this has \u201ceverything to do with Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy a Fox News conspiracy propaganda stuff is popping up on here, I have no idea,\u201d an exasperated Todd noted at one point.\n\n\u201cIt is not, that is exactly, because this is going over the line, exactly why President Trump is upset and why his supporters are upset with the news media,\u201d Johnson shouted, to which Todd exclaimed back: \u201cCan we please answer the question that I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you are not criticizing him?!\u201d\n\nEventually, Johnson would tell Todd that the reason he \u201cwinced\u201d when he heard about military aid being attached to Ukrainian investigations into the 2016 election is he didn\u2019t want to see those two things connected, adding that Trump \u201cadamantly denied\u201d to him that was occurring. He would then go on to support a probe by Ukraine into the Democrats surrounding the last presidential election.\n\n\u201cUkrainian officials reportedly helped Clinton allies research Trump\u2019s advisers,\u201d he huffed. \u201cThere is potential interference in the 2016 campaign. That\u2019s what Trump wants to get to the bottom of. But the press doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nJohnson added: \u201cI\u2019m being called a conspiracy theorist, John Solomon is, because the press is horribly biased and Trump and his supporters completely understand that.\u201d\n\nTodd confronted Johnson on whether or not he believes former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort was framed and if the Russians interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Trump. After saying he doesn\u2019t think Manafort was framed and the Russian \u201cabsolutely\u201d meddled in the election, Johnson pivoted back to supposed Ukrainian involvement during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of unanswered questions,\u201d the senator exclaimed. \u201cChuck, I just want the truth. The American people want the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo do you not trust the FBI? Do you not trust the CIA?\u201d Todd wondered, causing Johnson to yell back: \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t. Absolutely not. After Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, after James Comey?!\u201d\n\nAfter Johnson said he didn\u2019t trust anyone from the Obama administration, Todd asked him if he trusted the organizations now.\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t trust them back then,\u201d Johnson replied before listing off a series of former officials who have become favorite targets of the president's supporters.\n\nTodd, clearly out of patience with Johnson at the end, suggested Johnson was only interested in the truth that was \u201cpolitically comfortable\u201d for him before getting in one final parting shot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you chose to come on this way, senator.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWhy a Fox News conspiracy propaganda stuff is popping up on here, I have no idea,\u201d and exasperated Todd noted at one point.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570372090/meet-press_9_gvkaez", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
