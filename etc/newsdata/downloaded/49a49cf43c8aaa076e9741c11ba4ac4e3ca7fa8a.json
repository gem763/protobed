The International Space Station and weather and Earth-observing satellites have detected their massive smoke plumes and, in some cases, their flames.\n\nMost available space-based imagery shows the Kincade Fire, which has been dominating headlines since last Thursday when it broke out in the foothills of Sonoma County, Calif. Fanned by winds gusting over 90 mph at times and humidity plummeting to desert-like dryness, the inferno grew rapidly, now having scorched more than 75,000 acres.\n\nBy Sunday, the blaze was expanding at the average rate of 32 football fields per minute, blasting south and east and swallowing an area half the size of Washington, D.C., in just 12 hours.\n\nTODAY: NOAA's #GOES17, from 22,300 miles in space, captures the thick smoke plumes streaming from the massive #KincadeFire. @NWS: \"Potentially historic fire weather conditions expected in the northern Bay Area.\"\n\n#CaliforniaFires #CaWx #CAFireWX pic.twitter.com/u4Aqxwhr3k \u2014 NOAA Satellites - Public Affairs (@NOAASatellitePA) October 27, 2019\n\nThe Kincade Fire is the largest of several blazes that were ignited amid a string of strong California windstorms, leading this week to the third major fire weather event in barely 10 days.\n\n[What\u2019s driving the historic California high-wind events, and worsening the wildfires]\n\nOn Sunday, damaging winds blew through the slopes of central and northern California, cascading and accelerating down mountains and buffeting valleys with 40 to 60 mph winds.\n\nThe Sonoma County Airport saw humidity plummet 80 percent on Sunday night, with winds roaring to 33 mph within two hours\u2019 time, thanks to the sudden onset of dangerous tinderbox conditions that have been sweeping across the Golden State. The airport\u2019s weather station was \u201ctricked\u201d into logging rainfall reports, with ash and particulate matter likely spurring the sensor\u2019s errors.\n\nFrom space, \u201chot spots\u201d showed up where the GOES West satellite detected fledgling fires.\n\nThe explosive growth of the #KincadeFire, which now covers more than 75,000 acres, is visible in this Fire Temperature RGB imagery from #GOESWest.
