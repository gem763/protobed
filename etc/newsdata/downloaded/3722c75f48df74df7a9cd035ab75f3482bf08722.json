I can only hope that he was sincere enough to consider doing that for us.\"\n\nShe added that her son would have been \"a little blown away\" by the meeting with Trump.\n\nShe also said: \"He's the one in control here, but we are in control of our situation as much as we can be.\n\n\"And we still want justice for Harry. And we will take it as far as we possibly can to ensure that that's done.\"\n\nOfficials sitting in on the talks insisted that Sacoolas would not be returning to the UK to face justice.\n\nThe President told the family that \"his good friend\" Boris Johnson called him to see if anything could be done about their son's case.\n\nMr Dunn said after the meeting: \"I think the President was very graceful and spoke very well to us.\n\n\"Obviously we've just met the President and we never thought we'd get this far, but I don't know whether we're any further along.\"\n\n(Image: SKY NEWS)\n\nHe added: \"The President was very professional and he spoke very well to us. He listened to Charlotte very well.\n\n\"She spoke excellent to him, and he was understanding. And I think he generally will look to try and resolve this is a way to help us.\"\n\nIn a post on the Justice 4 Harry GoFundMe page, Ms Charles and Mr Dunn said of the meeting at the White House: \"We are grateful for the invitation, which we hope represents a positive development in our fight for justice.\n\n\"Our priority, as any parent will understand, is justice for our child.\n\n\"We believe this can only be achieved if Anne Sacoolas returns to England and engages properly with the justice system, where she will be treated fairly in a proper investigation of what happened to our son on that day - an investigation that cannot happen without her co-operation.\n\n\"Friends tell each other the truth. If Britain and America are friends then we believe there should be no possibility of a citizen of one country hiding from justice in another while falsely claiming a privilege such as diplomatic immunity.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe GoFundMe had raised almost \u00a360,000 as of Wednesday morning.\n\nBefore arriving at the White House, dad Tim Dunn told Mirror Online: \"We are surprised we have been invited to the White House - we are not sure exactly who we are seeing yet.\"\n\nThe parents recently urged the authorities to bring Mrs Sacoolas back to the UK after she fled to the US.\n\nSacoolas, 42, has admitted driving on the wrong side of the road when she hit Harry on his motorbike.\n\nHer lawyer urged his family to ask media to stop trying to reach her as she claimed diplomatic immunity.\n\n\"Somewhere, somebody has made a decision to give this lady immunity,\" Mr Dunn said.\n\n\"She's not entitled to immunity as it's been said and we've known that from the start.\n\n\"They made a mistake, someone has made a mistake.\n\n\"On that night there was an accident, a lady made a mistake, she killed our son, she didn't mean to kill him, she didn't mean to have an accident, but you cannot walk away from that and just leave and expect nothing to happen.\n\n\"Our boy died and he deserves to have some justice.\n\n\"That's all we want.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump offered Harry Dunn's parents a chance to meet Anne Sacoolas in a shock twist at the White House, telling them the US spy's wife was waiting in the next room", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Andy Lines", "Image", "Internet Unknown", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Sky News", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587413.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_US-envoys-wife-left-UK-after-accident-killing-motorcyclist.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
