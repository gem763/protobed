But when we are afraid, we can sometimes feel very cold. If we get a sudden, terrible fright, we say our blood ran cold. This is a biological reaction to danger. When we are stressed, our heart beats faster, we stop digesting food, our blood pressure increases and our brain redirects blood to other parts of our body to prepare us for an attack or to flee.\n\nWhat kind of things would make your blood run cold?\n\n20 idioms about people and places to make your writing better\n\nWitch-hunt\n\nYou might have heard this term in politics if you follow US President Donald Trump. Long ago, if things went wrong, people would blame it on witchcraft. This would cause people to panic. Some lowly member of the village would be sniffed out by the witch doctor (the person tasked with finding the witch), and usually killed by the villagers.\n\nWhile a witch can technically be male or female, most often they were women who were unprotected by their families. In some countries, this practice still happens today.\n\nThe modern use of \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d is to describe situations where people in power bully those with no power.\n\nCan you think of any witch-hunts you have read about in the news?\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nDevil\u2019s advocate\n\nIt is a rule in Western law that anyone accused of a crime should have a lawyer or \u201cadvocate\u201d to defend them, no matter what they are accused of \u2013 even if they are the devil himself.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, the advocatus diaboli was a person who would argue against someone being made a saint. They would make it their job to find out any dirt on the person who was going to be canonised (made into a saint).\n\nIn modern times, someone may take on the position of \u201cdevil\u2019s advocate\u201d when they agree with a statement but argue against it anyway.\n\nWould you want to be a lawyer for the devil?\n\n20 time idioms to spice up your writing\n\nLook like you have seen a ghost\n\nIf you were to see a ghost, you would be very shocked. Your skin might be pale, your eyes wide and your mouth hanging open.\n\nYour muscles might be stiff and you might not move for a few seconds.\n\nToday this saying is used to describe someone who has had a bad shock.\n\nWhat would make you look like you had seen a ghost?\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nSkeleton crew\n\nNo, this is not a ghostly pirate crew \u2013 although we like how your mind works.\n\nThis is the least amount of people needed to keep something running.\n\nUsually over public holidays or weekends, businesses do not make everyone work as normal. Instead, they may decide to only have a skeleton crew to take care of things for a day or two, so that as many people as possible get to enjoy the holiday.", "description": "Spice up your writing with these frightfully useful phrases.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/skeletonincloset.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
