REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - President Sebastian Pinera faced new protests on Monday after he replaced eight cabinet members including his interior and finance ministers, a house-cleaning aimed at taming the biggest political crisis since Chile\u2019s return to democracy in 1990.\n\nProtests last week that spun out of control had already prompted Pinera to pledge worker-friendly changes. The center-right billionaire who trounced the leftist opposition in 2017 elections vowed to boost the minimum wage and pensions, lower the prices of medicines and public transportation and assure proper health insurance.\n\nOn Monday Pinera sacked interior minister Andres Chadwick, his cousin and longtime confidant who came under fire last week for calling protesters \u201ccriminals.\u201d He replaced Chadwick, a right-wing politician, with Gonzalo Blumel, a 41-year-old presidency minister and liaison with the legislature.\n\nPinera also appointed Ignacio Briones, an economics professor, to replace finance minister Felipe Larrain.\n\n\u201cChile has changed, and the government must change with it to confront these new challenges,\u201d Pinera said in a televised speech from the La Moneda presidential palace.\n\nThe shake-up followed a week of riots, arson and protests over inequality that left at least 17 dead. Thousands were arrested and Chilean businesses lost $1.4 billion. With Pinera\u2019s popularity at an all-time low, Chileans were calling for new protests and the United Nations was sending a team to investigate allegations of human rights abuses.\n\nAs Pinera spoke, protesters had already begun to gather outside the presidential palace in downtown Santiago, waving flags, honking horns and calling for his ouster. They were quickly dispersed by security forces with tear gas.\n\nLater in the day, hundreds had begun to gather again for a rally at Plaza Italia, one of the city\u2019s central squares.\n\nChile, the world\u2019s top copper producer, has long boasted one of Latin America\u2019s most prosperous and stable economies, with low levels of poverty and unemployment.\n\nBut anger over entrenched inequality and spiraling costs of living had simmered below the surface. The protests that broke out last week resembled similar scenes around the world in recent months, with demonstrators from Hong Kong to Beirut to Barcelona angry at ruling elites.\n\nCHANGE OF TONE\n\nA Cadem poll published on Sunday found 80% of Chileans did not find Pinera\u2019s proposals adequate, which he acknowledged in his speech on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe know these measures don\u2019t solve all the problems, but they\u2019re an important first step,\u201d Pinera said.\n\nThe protesters do not have any one leader or spokesperson. Chile\u2019s fractured opposition parties have supported the demonstrations but have not led them.\n\nThe void has lent itself to increasingly extreme proposals from fringe groups, said Guillermo Holzmann, a political analyst with the University of Valparaiso.\n\n\u201cThe power vacuum is allowing the political agenda to be overtaken by these demands, and this is where the government must take control,\u201d he told Reuters, adding that Pinera\u2019s cabinet changes were \u201cnecessary, but not sufficient.\u201d\n\nLast Friday, a million Chileans of all stripes marched through downtown Santiago demanding a change to the social and economic model. It was the largest protest since Chile\u2019s return to democracy.\n\n\u2018NOT OVER YET\u2019\n\nOn Monday morning, people in Santiago returned to school or work to find traffic jams, a hobbled metro, graffiti and trash and broken glass littering streets from days of riots.\n\nJorge Sepulveda, a 33-year old truck driver, said the continuing unrest had hurt his bottom line.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dispute that people have the right to protest, but this is beginning to affect us all,\u201d he said as he smoked a cigarette on a street corner downtown. But, he said, Pinera\u2019s announcements had yet to satisfy him.\n\n\u201cHe needs to listen to the people,\u201d Sepulveda said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d\n\nSupport for Pinera has plunged to just 14%, the lowest approval rating for a Chilean president since the return to democracy, the Cadem poll showed.\n\nChilean President Sebastian Pinera delivers a speech during a cabinet reshuffle at the government house in Santiago, Chile October 28, 2019. REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nMany have critiqued Pinera\u2019s decision to place Santiago under military control, saying it hearkened back to the grim rule of dictator Augusto Pinochet. Pinera lifted the state of emergency at midnight Monday.\n\nU.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, a Socialist and former president of Chile, sent a fact-finding mission to the South American nation to conduct an independent investigation into allegations of abuse by security forces.\n\nPinera said on Monday he welcomed their visit, saying \u201cwe have nothing to hide.\u201d", "description": "President Sebastian Pinera faced new protests on Monday after he replaced eight cabinet members including his interior and finance ministers, a house-cleaning aimed at taming the biggest political crisis since Chile's return to democracy in 1990.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Natalia A.
