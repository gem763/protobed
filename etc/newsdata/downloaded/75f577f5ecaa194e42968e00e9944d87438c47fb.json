(AP) - Confirmed cases in a Legionnaires\u2019 disease outbreak in western North Carolina have grown to over 50, but health officials still aren\u2019t sure whether the illness originated from this month\u2019s Mountain State Fair.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services says 53 laboratory-confirmed cases of the disease have been reported as of Thursday. One death was previously reported this week, and most of the patients have required hospitalization.\n\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease is a bacterial pneumonia that develops when someone breathes in mist or water that contains the bacteria into their lungs.\n\nMany patients attended the fair. DHHS said on Friday that health officials visiting the Western North Carolina Agricultural Center - where the annual fair ended Sept. 15 - couldn\u2019t locate any mist or water vapor source to pose a bacteria risk.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Confirmed cases in a Legionnaires' disease outbreak in western North Carolina have grown to over 50, but health officials still aren't sure whether the illness originated from this month's Mountain State Fair.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
