He was at No 8 for Waikato on the Springboks\u2019 1994 New Zealand tour.\n\n\u2018We got belted and I got belted, too,\u2019 Mitchell said. \u2018It was a guy called Adrian Geldenhuys.\n\n\u2018He had octopus arms, I think. Then the final whistle went and it was just me and their man Mark Andrews, laughing. That was the game in those days.\u2019\n\nEngland's defence coach John Mitchell will have an important job in the World Cup final\n\nSouth Africa's brand of rugby isn't pretty, and England will have to fight fire with fire\n\nAnd now? Well, different. But not so much. Modern rugby doesn\u2019t have quite the same levels of off-the-ball viciousness \u2014 and check out footage of Geldenhuys against France in 1992 for some real vintage violence \u2014 but any match against the Springboks is going to be tough. More than tough, really. Probably the toughest.\n\nSouth African rugby has a brand and, while successful, it is not always pretty.\n\nBig men, running in straight lines. Big men, making big hits. Some of the most memorably brutal encounters of recent years have involved the Springboks, too.\n\nA year before the 2003 World Cup final, when red cards were much harder to come by, a gratuitously late hit on Jonny Wilkinson by Jannes Labuschagne saw the lock sent off after 22 minutes at Twickenham. \u2018A mile over the line,\u2019 was England coach Phil Larder\u2019s summing up of South Africa\u2019s play that day.\n\nThen there was the Battle of Pretoria in 2009, the second Test of the Lions tour that many claim is still the most savage rugby match of recent times.\n\nA brief lowlight? In a game that saw several players hospitalised, Schalk Burger was banned for eight weeks for gouging the right eye of Lions wing Luke Fitzgerald.\n\nSome of England's most brutal games throughout history have been against the Springboks\n\n\u2018This is sport, this is what it\u2019s all about,\u2019 said South Africa coach Peter de Villiers, defending his player.\n\nHe suggested later that those who disapproved should don tutus and join the ballet.\n\nThere has been nothing as extreme in South Africa\u2019s play at this World Cup, and nothing to suggest nefarious tactics are planned. They have earned a reputation as spoilers, though, as a team not afraid to use kicking and slow ball and the brute strength of their pack and some hefty replacements to crush the life out of opponents.\n\nAs the England coach responsible for defence, Mitchell will be a hugely important influence as Eddie Jones prepares his players for this latest war of attrition.\n\nIf nothing can top the challenge of defeating the All Blacks last Saturday, the physical test of beating South Africa is the most intense in that specific sphere. No nation plays rugby quite like the Boks. They are not the flair team of this competition, they are certainly not its entertainers, but if England are unable to match the intensity of their opponents in Yokohama, they are at risk.\n\nIn World Cup history, only 11 matches ended without a try, two of them in South Africa finals\n\nIn World Cup history, only 11 matches have ended without a try being scored \u2014 and two of them were South Africa\u2019s victorious finals. This is a team who will not be fazed by winning ugly. \u2018When I watched the Springboks as a kid, when I played against them, when I played against any South Africa team and when I coached them, what their rugby has been built on is the ability to create pressure,\u2019 said Mitchell.\n\n\u2018It is very forward-dominated rugby. They love their scrum, they love their lineout drive and they love the physical nature of the game. There are so many ways you can play this game and they play a particular style, and it works for them. For instance, they always seem to have an intimidator at No 4. It is just their way.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve just got to be aware and be ready for anything that\u2019s chucked at you, which is kind of what we\u2019re expecting.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve got running threats, kicking threats, huge carry threats and in that Test against Wales the other night they went to their scrum, they went to their lineout when it mattered.\n\n\u2018I used to look at them and think they create pressure like no other team in the world. But what is great about rugby now is that there is another team who can do that \u2014 and it\u2019s us.\u2019\n\nBilly Vunipola plays in Mitchell\u2019s old position and will be responsible for some of the bigger hits on Saturday.\n\nThe 'kamikaze kids' Tom Curry and Sam Underhill will be among those dishing out the hits\n\nHe takes his lead, he says, from Maro Itoje, but also from England\u2019s flankers, the Kamikaze Kids, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, who contributed bone-shaking tackles against the All Blacks that set the tone of the game.\n\nSouth Africa having promised already to fight fire with fire, Vunipola says England will respond the only way they know how. It is a message similar to the one sent when the players fanned out to accept the challenge of the haka last week.\n\nIt was there in the cold stares, or the flicker of a smile playing across the face of Owen Farrell. And it will be there again to face down the Springboks. Bring it on, England will say. Hit us with your best shot. We can take it.\n\nVunipola said: \u2018A lot of people talk about it, and it\u2019s easy to sit here and say we want to be brutal, but when coaches throw words like that at you, it\u2019s down to you to back them up.\n\n\u2018Those guys \u2014 Underhill, Curry, Maro \u2014 are probably the best at leading in that area. When you see a big hit, the effect is unmeasurable, but I think the best way to explain it is that it\u2019s quite contagious. It becomes easier to do once you\u2019ve seen it. So we\u2019ve been challenged to bring the same intensity this weekend because they have some big players on their team. It\u2019s a similar threat to New Zealand, but we have a few big blokes with us, too.\u2019\n\nEngland are favourites for the match, but Mitchell is well aware of the threats of South Africa\n\nWhen the idea that South Africa represent the biggest physical test was put to Vunipola, however, he was close to incredulous.\n\n\u2018Is that a trick question?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Look, the All Blacks have been the best in the world for ever and that physicality has helped them get to that stage.\n\n\u2018So, we set out wanting to be the best in the world and now we have to back up what we did last week. It can\u2019t just be a one-off, a fluke.\n\n\u2018The challenge has been laid out by South Africa because we saw them taking Japan apart, and Wales, and the challenge is going to be up front and we are going to have to be there, both mentally and physically.\n\n\u2018They have already come out and said they want to fight fire with fire and I guess we return that by saying: bring it on. It is a final and one of those things you have to front up to.\n\n\u2018They have many different threats and one of the biggest is their forward pack, none more so probably than their second-rowers and Duane Vermeulen.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve played against them a few times and Vermeulen\u2019s got one up on me lately. He\u2019s such a big player for them and last summer he was monumental in getting them two victories. So, I\u2019m going to try my best to win that little battle.\u2019\n\nHe smiled at the irony.
