These are problems that can only be solved by significant structural and cultural changes at MSNBC, NBC News, and its parent company, Comcast,\u201d she added.\n\nWhile NBC News continues to claim it is guilty of absolutely nothing, this just doesn\u2019t pass the smell test.\n\nIn his book (which I\u2019m about 70 percent through), Farrow casts a damning spotlight on a supposed news network that had a major story on its hands, a consequential story others had been trying to bring home for more than ten years, and literally told Farrow to shop it elsewhere.\n\nFarrow makes a very convincing and credible claim that two things kept NBC News from running with his Harvey Weinstein bombshell: 1) Weinstein knew about the alleged predations of disgraced former Today Show anchor Matt Lauer, NBC News/MSNBC Chairman Andrew Lack, and others, and threatened to go public; and 2) there were major business conflicts of interest with NBC News President Noah Oppenheim (a sometimes screenwriter) and NBCUniversal, the entertainment wing of the NBC family.\n\nNothing else makes sense.\n\nAnd it was not just that NBC sent Farrow down the road with a story that would eventually win a Pulitzer; NBC also ignored and downplayed the bombshell story after it broke wide open.\n\nNBC is currently circling the wagons, hoping this will all go away, but already a local women\u2019s group is calling for Lack to resign from a state board over Catch and Kill\u2019s revelations about his alleged sexual harassment of subordinates.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Farrow\u2019s claim that NBC News knew about Lauer\u2019s alleged misbehavior long before he was fired in 2017 just received a boost with Wednesday\u2019s news about NBC forcing an unnamed woman to sign a nondisclosure agreement to cover up her extramarital affair with Lauer, which she says put her in a terrible position due to the imbalance of power between the two.\n\nLauer denies any wrongdoing. NBC denies any wrongdoing. But unlike Fox News, which brought in an outside law firm to investigate numerous harassment allegations (which resulted in top heads being rolled out the door), NBC has only ever investigated itself and issued denials.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
