The other included cars used by Biegun when he met Swedish Foreign Ministry officials on Friday.\n\nThe delegation from North Korea, also known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which is under sanctions banning much of its trade due to its nuclear programme, arrived in Sweden on Thursday after Pyongyang unexpectedly said talks would take place on Oct. 5.\n\nNewly-appointed Foreign Minister Ann Linde gave Sweden's first acknowledgment of the negotiations, while a foreign ministry spokesman also confirmed the working-level talks.\n\n\"I am encouraged that US and DPRK working level delegations are currently in Sweden to hold talks. Dialogue needed to reach denuclearization and peaceful solution,\" Linde said on Twitter.\n\nAnalysts have said the leaders of both countries face growing incentives to reach a deal, although it is unclear whether common ground can be found after months of tension and deadlock.\n\nOnly a day after announcing the resumption of talks, North Korea said it had test-fired a new ballistic missile designed for submarine launch, a provocative gesture that also underscored the need for Washington to move quickly to negotiate limits on Pyongyang's growing arsenal.
