The Seahawks traded him to the Philadelphia Eagles in March 2018, and he posted nine sacks for them.\n\nDespite that solid season, the Eagles traded him to the Patriots in March, and in six games with the Pats, he managed just 2.5 sacks and five tackles, starting just one game. And now he's in Dallas.\n\nRecent issues in New England may have contributed to his short stay with the organization. Bennett was suspended last week for conduct detrimental to the team, reportedly stemming from a verbal confrontation with defensive line coach Bret Bielema.\n\n\"It's America. You can voice your opinion about how you feel about certain situations. That's what I did,\" Bennett told reporters about his \"philosophical disagreement\" with Bielema, per Mike Reiss of ESPN.\n\nBennett was getting fewer snaps than perhaps he was accustomed to, however.\n\n\"It's always an adjustment when you're not playing, just getting used to it,\" he said. \"But we're winning, and that's the most important thing for me as a teammate. But I think as an individual, you always want to play more and make some more plays. So it's always that great balance between both.\"\n\nNonetheless, the Pats decided to part ways, a move that also has financial benefits for the team:\n\nAs for the 4-3 Cowboys, it gives the team quite the fleet of defensive ends, with Bennett joining starters DeMarcus Lawrence and Robert Quinn and backups Kerry Hyder and Dorance Armstrong. Bennett also has the ability to play in the interior in passing downs, giving the Cowboys some versatility in that regard.\n\nWhether he wears out his welcome in Dallas will be another story entirely.", "description": "Michael Bennett is on the move again.
