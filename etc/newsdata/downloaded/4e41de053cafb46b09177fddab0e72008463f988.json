It may be the last one. Please make the best use of this time,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe election bill will now go to the unelected upper House of Lords for debate on Wednesday, but peers are expected to back the plan, paving the way for parliament to be dissolved early next week.\n\nJohnson took office in July promising to end the wrangling over Brexit which has bitterly divided the country, but a rebellion over his hard-line strategy left him without a majority in parliament.\n\nUnable to win MPs' support for new divorce terms he struck with Brussels, he was forced by law earlier this month to ask EU leaders for a delay.\n\nAfter three failed attempts to pass a normal election motion, which requires the support of two-thirds of MPs, Johnson on Tuesday took an alternative path.\n\nHe introduced a bill to legislate for an election - a method which required only a simple majority, and passed by 438 votes to 20.\n\nCorbyn had sought to amend the government's bill to hold the election on December 9, but this was defeated by 315 votes to 295.\n\nThe veteran socialist had been torn between rival camps within his own party over whether to proceed with the vote.\n\nBut the smaller Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats wanted a vote, making it hard for Labour to stand in their way.\n\nCorbyn had publicly argued that he would not allow an election until Johnson's threat to leave the EU without a divorce deal was removed.\n\nThe EU's decision to delay Brexit meant that \"for the next three months, our condition of taking no-deal off the table has now been met\", he announced.\n\n", "description": "British MPs have agreed to hold an early election, backing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call to try to break the crippling political deadlock that has seen Brexit delayed three times.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7849/a756efc7cc3e467c96f9b1f54510fbac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
