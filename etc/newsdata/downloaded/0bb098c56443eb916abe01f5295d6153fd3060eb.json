The open letter, obtained by The New York Times, has been signed by more than 250 employees who believe the platform is being weaponized by politicians and threatens what the company stands for \u2014 allowing people to express their voice.\n\n\u201cMisinformation affects us all. Our current policies on fact checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for. We strongly object to this policy as it stands. It doesn\u2019t protect voices, but instead allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy.\u201d\n\nCourageous workers at Facebook are now standing up to the corporation\u2019s leadership, challenging Zuckerberg\u2019s disturbing policy on allowing paid, targeted disinformation ads in the 2020 election: https://t.co/jDJE7WplVy \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 28, 2019\n\nSince the Cambridge Analytica Scandal last year, where 50 million profiles had their data breached, Facebook\u2019s reputation plummeted resulting in a wave of global distrust. Employees of Facebook believe the social network\u2019s stance on political ads will only further add to this:\n\n\u201cAllowing paid civic misinformation to run on the platform in its current state has the potential to increase distrust in our platform by allowing similar paid and organic content to sit side-by-side \u2014 some with third-party fact-checking and some without. Additionally, it communicates that we are OK profiting from deliberate misinformation campaigns by those in or seeking positions of power.\u201d\n\nThe letter offered the social network \u2018proposals for improvement,\u2019 including: hold political ads to the same standards as other ads, restrict audience targeting for political ads, and provide a stronger visual design for political ads.\n\nAccording to Facebook, they\u2019ve \u201cmade significant investments since 2016 to reduce the spread of viral misinformation and fake accounts.\u201d\n\nThis comes after a study by the Oxford Internet Institute found that since 2017, organized social media manipulation has more than doubled with at least 70 countries known to be using online propaganda to manipulate mass public opinion, and in some cases, on a global scale. Despite there being more social media platforms than ever, Facebook remains the most popular choice for online manipulation with propaganda campaigns found on the platform in 56 countries.\n\nWith election campaigns being directly affected by technological advances,, social platforms like Facebook must take responsibility for preventing the spread of misinformation. While the number of signatures on the open letter represents just a fraction of Facebook\u2019s overall 35,000-plus workforce, the action taken by the tech giant\u2019s employees is a rare sign of resistance against the corporation.\n\nRead next: CHEAP: Fear me, neighbors \u2014 there's $100 off this Samsung Harman Kardon soundbar and subwoofer", "description": "Facebook employees issued an open letter urging Mark Zuckerberg to rethink the company's strategy for regulating paid political ads on the platform.", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2F200-calories-12.png&signature=880c9e1678c162b026e77fd0ebd5ea40", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
