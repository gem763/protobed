The Bahamas Prime Minister, Dr Hubert Minnis, said that the damage is \u201cunprecedented.\u201d A reporter present described the scene as \u201cpure hell.\"\n\nThe world hasn\u2019t closed its eyes and ears when it comes to the harrowing circumstances faced by the islands of the Bahamas. India too has now joined in the relief effort.\n\nOn September 8, the country announced a disaster relief aid of USD$1 million to help those affected by the hurricane.\n\nRaveesh Kumar, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson, announced the news on Twitter. He wrote that India is standing \u201cin solidarity with the friendly people of The #Bahamas.\u201d\n\nIndia and the Bahamas have been friends for a while now. In a 2018 report released by the Ministry of External Affairs, the government spoke of a \u201cconvergence of views of various important contemporary issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bahamas has consistently supported Indian candidates, unilaterally or reciprocally, to various UN and other international bodies,\u201d the report read.\n\nThey also noted strong bilateral trade between the two countries. The highest recorded total \u2013 $2.8 billion in 2012-13 \u2013 included the trade of minerals, chemicals, ships, and aircrafts.\n\nWhen it comes to Hurricane Dorian, the numbers speak for themselves. At least 45 people have been declared dead and over 70,000 residents are in need of food and shelter. According to the BBC, over 90 percent of the infrastructure in the Abaco Islands, located in the northern Bahamas, is destroyed.\n\nThe extent of the damage has come to the United States, where at least two people have died and thousands have faced a power-cut. Canada, too, has felt the destruction. CBS News reports that winds reached Nova Scotia as of September 8, and hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses have lost power.\n\nBut there are some who find the relief aid to be problematic. Several Indians replied to Kumar\u2019s tweet pointing out that there are several domestic problems within the country, for which the government is allegedly not doing enough for. The criticism comes as Kashmir continues to be a contentious point, with violence in the region on the rise after India revoked the country\u2019s special status. In other parts of India, severe flooding and droughts have ravaged infrastructure and homes.\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "India and the Bahamas have had a notably friendly political relationship for years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d760ed6d412b700085a4dd6/lede/1568018277548-hurricane-dorian.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.9980769230769231xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
