Ito is said to have let Epstein\u2014who had already spent a year in jail after a sex-trafficking investigation\u2014handle the discussions with donors. \u201cGates would like a write up on our one science program for tues next week,\u201d Epstein allegedly wrote to Ito at one point. The donation from Gates was later described as having been \u201cdirected\u201d by Epstein, according to the report.\n\nOnce the donations were made, the lab reportedly went to great lengths to keep Epstein\u2019s involvement secret. Documentation filed with the university did not mention Epstein by name, stating instead: \u201cGates is making this gift at the recommendation of a friend of his who wishes to remain anonymous.\u201d A spokesperson for Gates told The New Yorker: \u201cAny claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grantmaking for Bill Gates is completely false.\u201d\n\nTHE LAB WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO HIDE EPSTEIN\u2019S INVOLVEMENT\n\nThe Media Lab\u2019s efforts to keep Epstein\u2019s involvement under wraps was so well-known among staffers that some employees in Ito\u2019s office referred to the convicted sex offender as Voldemort, \u201che who must not be named\u201d from the Harry Potter series, Farrow reported. In MIT\u2019s official donor database, Epstein was listed as \u201cdisqualified\u201d\u2014and the lab took pains to make sure his dealings were kept secret.\n\nAs recently as September 2014, Ito is said to have emailed Epstein seeking \u201canother $100K\u201d so the lab could extend a researcher\u2019s contract. When forwarding the email to a staffer, Ito allegedly wrote, \u201cMake sure this gets accounted for as anonymous.\u201d The then-director of Development and Strategy, Peter Cohen, wrote, \u201cJeffrey money, needs to be anonymous. Thanks,\u201d according to the report. Cohen is said to have echoed that language in a message about Gates\u2019 donation, writing, \u201cFor gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey\u2019s name as the impetus for this gift.\u201d He later reportedly said future records on donations involving Epstein should be made only \u201cif there is a way to do it quietly.\u201d\n\nEPSTEIN VISITED WITH \u2018FEMALE ASSISTANTS\u2019\n\nEpstein was reportedly invited to the Media Lab in 2015 to provide \u201cinput\u201d on the projects his money was funding. Signe Swenson, a former development associate and alumni coordinator at the Media Lab, told The New Yorker she had pushed back against the visit in vain. Swenson said she ultimately resigned in 2016 partly because of the lab\u2019s ties to Epstein. \u201cI don\u2019t think he should be on campus,\u201d Swenson recalled saying at the time. \u201cAt that point it hit me: this pedophile is going to be in our office.\u201d\n\nSwenson said Cohen conceded that Epstein was \u201cunsavory\u201d but told her \u201cwe\u2019re planning to do it anyway\u2014this was Joi\u2019s project.\u201d The visit was marked on Ito\u2019s calendar without any mention of Epstein by name, Swenson said. \u201cThere was definitely an explicit conversation about keeping it off the books, because Joi's calendar is visible to everyone,\u201d she was quoted as saying.\n\nMedia Lab staffers were told to expect Epstein to bring his \u201ctwo female \u2018assistants,\u2019\u201d without whom he \u201cnever goes into any room.\u201d Ito is said to have explicitly informed Cohen that Epstein would have two women in tow. When Epstein arrived, Swenson said she saw the two young women in question. \u201cThey were models. Eastern European, definitely.\u201d All of the female staffers at the lab \u201cmade it a point to be super nice to them,\u201d Swenson said. \u201cWe literally had a conversation about how, on the off chance that they\u2019re not there by choice, we could maybe help them.\u201d", "description": "The New Yorker\u2019s Ronan Farrow says paperwork indicates the accused sex trafficker \u201cdirected\u201d a $2 million donation from Bill Gates to the lab.", "authors": ["Allison Quinn", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567831130/190716-epstein-mug4_1_l3mxys", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
