In a clever move, PresidentTrump\u2019s campaign will take advantage of the Labor Day holiday and use flyover banner ads in beach areas.\n\nNot just any beach areas, mind you. The campaign is targeting cities that went blue in 2016 in hopes of gathering about 30,000 phone numbers to add to its list of supporters. The cities include Milwaukee, Wisconsin., Erie, Pennsylvania., Cleveland, Virginia Beach, Va., Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale and South Beach, Florida. All of them delivered Hillary Clinton with the majority of their votes. It will cost about $20,000 to do. Planes will fly the banners for a total of 21 hours.\n\nOn Labor Day, President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign plans to fly banners urging beachgoers in cities that largely went blue in 2016 to add their phone numbers to the list of supporters the campaign has been cultivating. That list already has contact information for more than 33 million voters or about half of the number of Americans who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, and campaign manager Brad Parscale expects to have at least 50 million by Election Day.\n\nTrump won these states, except Virginia, but not the cities in the 2016 presidential election. Much to the chagrin of bitter Hillary voters, she lost the electoral college and the election over her neglect of three states in particular \u2013 Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. She concentrated on the urban areas, and won them, but failed to win the rest of the states\u2019 voters. She didn\u2019t even bother to go to Wisconsin at all. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have 75 electoral votes altogether.\n\nIncluding Detroit, a solid Democrat stronghold, in the operation is a show of the level of seriousness the campaign has for going into unfriendly areas.\n\nDetroit backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with 95% of the vote in the 2016 presidential election, while Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes or two-tenths of a percentage point. The ads are expected to be towed over the Detroit area after the scheduled conclusion of the annual Labor Day parade \u2014 roughly from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday. Trump made inroads with union households during the 2016 election.\n\nAs I wrote Saturday, the Trump campaign is thinking outside the box and using unorthodox advertising to capture the attention of voters. Just as holding big-dollar fundraisers in California during Emmy week in September will take attention away from celebrities patting themselves on the back, flyover banners over the beaches of swing states is a smart move. It\u2019s cheap and will certainly garner attention by the local press. Who doesn\u2019t look up to read the banner when one flies overhead?\n\nThe Trump campaign has already targeted these areas with digital advertising.\n\nThe Trump campaign has already focused much of its digital advertising on Facebook on the swing states the flyovers are targeting, according to analysis of Facebook ad data by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic digital firm that tracks spending in the 2020 presidential race. Between March 30 and Aug. 24, the campaign spent the second-most amount\u2014$484,467\u2014 on Facebook ads in Florida and the fourth-most\u2014$276,421\u2014in Ohio, followed by $266,853 in Pennsylvania and $211,490 in Michigan.\n\nFlyover banners aren\u2019t the campaign\u2019s most unconventional advertising, either. That title is safe with the campaign\u2019s use of plastic straw sales to raise funds. Remember the hubbub over the Trump straws when some cities began to ban plastic straws in restaurants and other public venues? The campaign is laughing all the way to the bank, having raised about $750,000 from the straw sales.\n\nSo, if you are planning to head out to one of these spots for Labor Day and see a plane in the sky with a banner trailing behind it, just wave. Some pilot is working while you are enjoying a day at the beach \u2013 a wave is a friendly thing to do. We know the kind of hand gestures that the Trump deranged beach-goers will make.", "description": "Swing state voters targeted", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/TrumpBanner2020KeepAmGrt715.png"}
