It's a fascinating period to be playing cricket for England.\n\n\"There's some very, very talented guys that have played a lot of cricket now for England that are all together and have the experience of going through the ups, the downs and everything in between.\n\n\"I think if you look at the All Blacks in the two previous World Cups, the amount of caps they had leading into those tournaments, there's a reason why they were successful.\n\n\"Vice versa, there's a reason why we have the processes we have implemented and the way in which we\u2019re going about our training, our fitness levels and everything like that is heading in the right direction.\"\n\nAs for England's semi-final victory over the All Blacks in Yokohama, Bairstow added: \"We all watched it at the team hotel and it was amazing to see.\n\n\"To say you've watched the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand when England were playing New Zealand is pretty cool.\"\n\nBairstow is undaunted by the prospect of only 12 months of preparation for the T20 World Cup as opposed to the meticulous four-year planning that went into the 50-over success.\n\nHe added: \"You've got guys playing T20 in competitions around the world whether that be the Indian Premier League, Big Bash (in Australia) or whatever it may be, so I'm not too sure it's going to make too much of a difference.\n\n\"Then you've got the Hundred that's starting next year so that's an even shorter format that will allow people to put their skills on show to potentially push for that squad.\"", "description": "Jonny Bairstow believes England are following a similar blueprint to the one that allowed the New Zealand rugby team to flourish.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9530/1177c96d1298454496b31d1daaa3aced.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
