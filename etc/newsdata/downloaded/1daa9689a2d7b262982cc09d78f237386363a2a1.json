But it means the time MPs have to pass laws to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October would be cut. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said it was a \"constitutional outrage\". The Speaker, who does not traditionally comment on political announcements, continued: \"However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of [suspending Parliament] now would be to stop [MPs] debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country.\" Three Conservative members of the Queen's Privy Council took the request to suspend Parliament to the monarch's Scottish residence in Balmoral on Wednesday morning on behalf of the prime minister. It has now been approved, allowing the government to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday 9 September and no later than Thursday 12 September, until Monday 14 October. While it is not possible to mount a legal challenge to the Queen's exercise of her personal prerogative powers, BBC legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman said a judicial review could be launched into the advice given to her by the prime minister - to determine whether that advice was lawful.\n\nGuardian Live\n\nThe Guardian Live Blog has more details.\n\nCan MPs Stop Prorogation?\n\nNo. Parliament is due to go on a three-week conference recess anyway in the second week of September and there had been suggestions MPs would vote against holding this recess, or any attempt to extend it. However, proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in this way.\n\nLabour Leader Jeremy Corbyn Comments\n\n\u201cWhat the prime minister is doing is a sort of smash and grab on our democracy in order to force through a no-deal exit from the European Union. What is he so afraid of that he has to suspend parliament in order to prevent parliament discussing these matters? Corbyn said the first thing Labour would do was to put forward legislation to prevent the suspension, and than there would be a challenge in the form of a vote of no confidence. Asked about plans by a cross-party group of MPs to hold an alternative parliament, and calls by some Labour MPs for people to take to the streets, he replied: \u201cWe will do everything that we can. We will join everybody else in doing that.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson Confirms Queens Speech on October 14\n\n\"As I said on the steps of Downing Street, we\u2019re not going to wait until 31 October before getting on with our plans to take this country forward. This is a new government with a very exciting agenda ... We have to be bringing forward new and important bills. That\u2019s why we are going to have a Queen\u2019s speech and we are going to do it on 14 October.\"\n\n\n\nStop the Coup\n\nIncredible scenes tonight as thousands of protestors pour onto the streets in Westminster shouting \u201cSTOP THE COUP\u201d.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2019\n\nBoris Will Likely Call For Elections\n\nBoris will likely call for elections, but two-thirds of parliament has to agree.\n\nIs Boris\u2019s real aim to invite on a no confidence vote next week and force a general election on his preferred battle ground? Also high risk, as a majority with the Brexit Party still alive is v unsure, and a pact with Farage will mean having to govern with him. \u2014 Tom Newton Dunn (@tnewtondunn) August 28, 2019\n\nParliament Efforts\n\nThe articles discuss parliamentary legislation but such talk is useless.\n\nParliament can vote all it wants to prevent No Deal but such votes are not binding.\n\nBoris Johnson set a date of October 14 for the Queen's Speech. Parliament can only amend legislation at that time. It will be too late to stop Brexit.\n\nThe one and only option on the table that could work is if on September 3 parliament passes a motion of No Confidence and simultaneously comes up with a candidate that has a majority.\n\n?? No.10 threatening an election ??\n\n\n\n\"If MPs pass a no confidence vote next week then we won\u2019t resign. We won\u2019t recommend another government, we\u2019ll dissolve parliament, call an election between November 1-5 and there\u2019ll be zero chance of Grieve legislation,\u201d says senior official. \u2014 Sebastian Payne (@SebastianEPayne) August 28, 2019\n\nAny Tories who vote against the government will be outed and lose their seats in the next election.\n\nEven then, Boris Johnson could refuse to stand down as the above Tweet suggests, but that would likely trigger a court challenge.", "description": "At Boris Johnson's request, the Queen agreed to suspend parliament .09/02/2019 3:20:27AM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/275/18070c07-7b31-4ac3-9b96-a1d77e837649.jpg"}
