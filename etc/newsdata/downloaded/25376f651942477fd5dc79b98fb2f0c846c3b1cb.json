Dianne Feinstein, a former mayor of San Francisco, and Sen. Kamala Harris, former district attorney in the city, have shared deep political roots in one of the country\u2019s most liberal cities. But those ties apparently didn\u2019t bind when it came to the 2020 race for the White House.\n\nThis week, Feinstein, California\u2019s senior senator, made it official when she bypassed Harris and delivered her plum endorsement for the Democratic presidential nomination to former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cDuring my time in the Senate, I have been dedicated to finding common-sense solutions,\u2019\u2019 Feinstein said in a statement. \u201cIn a Congress dominated by ideological polarization, we need a President that will deliver real solutions and has that same steadfast dedication to results. The current administration has not only exacerbated the existing divisions in Congress, but has divided the nation with hateful rhetoric and harmful policies \u2014 making it impossible for this country to move forward.\u2019\u2019\n\nBiden, she said, \u201cwill continue the fight to restore the soul of the nation from the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nWhile Harris rolled out her White House run before a crowd of 22,000 supporters earlier this year and has managed to land a slew of big-name California endorsements \u2014 including from Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 her failure to snag the endorsement of Feinstein, who's been a fixture in the state's politics for generations, is seen by many as another blow to her 2020 campaign, which has lagged in recent polls.\n\nStill, in California, where many have long viewed the two as having an uneasy relationship, few were surprised \u2014 especially because Feinstein and her husband, Richard Blum, hosted Biden at a fundraiser in their home last week.\n\n\u201cDianne has known Joe longer than Kamala\u2019s been alive,\u2019\u2019 one high-profile Democratic strategist who knows both said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nHarris\u2019 team, including her longtime adviser Debbie Mesloh, downplayed the differences and said the two share much common ground, having \u201cworked together over the years on issues that are important to Californians.\u201d\n\n\u201cKamala served as D.A. of Sen. Feinstein\u2019s hometown of San Francisco and was supported by the senator when she ran and won to be California\u2019s first female attorney general,\u2019\u2019 Mesloh told POLITICO. \u201cIn the Senate, they have worked together on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\u201d\n\nMesloh said Feinstein, as one of the longest-serving members of the Senate, naturally has many long-term relationships in that body, but \u201cwhat will be important is that we are all united after the primary to beat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nOthers said Feinstein\u2019s endorsement is the result of a longtime political relationship \u2014 and a pragmatic view of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cFeinstein endorsing Biden is mostly about Biden,\u2019\u2019 said Rose Kapolczynski, a veteran Democratic strategist who has advised former Sen. Barbara Boxer and Tom Steyer, a billionaire activist who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cThey served together for 15 years in the Senate, which is a very small, collegial body.\u2019\u2019\n\nFeinstein and Biden, who represented Delaware in the Senate, have worked side by side on key issues, and he was at her side in some of her toughest battles.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Feinstein got elected to the Senate and was facing a tough reelect, her assault-weapons ban got incorporated into Biden\u2019s crime bill \u2014 and they worked together on that,\u2019\u2019 Kapolczynski recalled. \u201cIt was one of her signature accomplishments and crucial to her politics.\u2019\u2019\n\nThrough the years, Feinstein and Biden \u2014 the key link to the Senate of President Barack Obama, who regularly reached to the chamber \u2014 developed a political relationship \u201cthat is long and deep,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nStylistically, too, there\u2019s an affinity, Kapolczynski said: \u201cBoth Dianne and Joe are pragmatists. They want to hammer out the details, bring people together and get it done. \u2026 So it\u2019s very natural that she would choose Joe out of this field of candidates.\u2019\u2019\n\nPrivately, some California Democrats say there has long been a gulf between the 85-year-old Feinstein\u2019s formality and centrist politics and Harris, who at 54 is a generation younger.\n\nTheir political differences played out in the headlines early in Harris\u2019 career when, as San Francisco district attorney in 2004, Harris said she would not seek the death penalty for a gang member who fatally shot a 29-year-old police officer, Isaac Espinoza.", "description": "Sen.
