If you like dropping someone online, then you'll find plenty of company this week.\n\nEverything's about knocking heads one way or another, from blockbusters like the Modern Warfare reboot to Skullgirls on the Switch and games like Doorkickers. If that's not enough, PS4 fans can pick up Castlevania again for cheap through the Arcade Archives program, and then you've got games like The Outer Worlds, MediEvil's retro bonking, and naturally, WWE 2K20.\n\nHere's the scoreboard. As always, note that this is what's available to Australians as of this morning - some games will be available on some platforms overseas on the EU or US storefronts, but not the Australian one.\n\nMonaco (Switch)\n\nWWE 2K20 (PC, PS4, XBO)\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare (PC, PS4, XBO)\n\nMediEvil (PS4)\n\nThe Outer Worlds (PC, PS4, XBO)\n\nPixel Gladiator (Switch, XBO)\n\nStreet Outlaws: The List (XBO)\n\nBeholder 2 (PS4)\n\nArcade Archives: Castlevania (PS4)\n\nDoor Kickers: Action Squad (Switch, PS4)\n\nMoons of Madness (PC)\n\nLonely Mountains: Downhill (PC)\n\nNanotale Typing Chronicles (PC)\n\nCrossroads Inn (PC)\n\nSkullgirls (Switch)\n\nSea Salt (Switch)\n\nTangle Tower (Switch)\n\nDay and Night (Switch)\n\nSecret Neighbour (PC)\n\nSpace Company Simulator (PC)\n\nBorderlands 2 VR (PC)\n\nFarming Simulator 19: Platinum Expansion (PC)\n\nLaser Arena Online (PC)\n\nAilment (PC)\n\nVortex Attack EX (PC)\n\nAfterparty (PC)\n\nCat Quest 2 (Switch, XBO)\n\nDark Devotion (Switch)\n\nDusk Diver (Switch)\n\nLet's Sing 2020 (Switch)\n\nXenocrisis (Switch)\n\nCreepy Brawlers (Switch)\n\nOnto the trailers! Let's remind ourselves how creepy Mars can be with Moons of Madness.\n\nCertainly plenty to keep people occupied this week. We're already playing through a couple of games, although one I'm looking forward to knocking some time out with is Modern Warfare, at least the ray-traced version of it anyway. I've always got a soft spot in my heart for classic COD. We'll have plenty to say about all the big games this week \u2014 most have or are under embargo already.\n\nSee anything you like this week? See anything that's interesting that you'd like us to cover?", "description": "Swords, shotguns, assault rifles, flying elbows.
