The architect of the alliance making this triumph possible was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose goal was not only to prevail over the Axis but, as Nigel Hamilton writes in his history of FDR as war leader, \u201cto form a worldwide international organization\u201d to secure the peace.\n\nThat organization became the United Nations, which later this month will hold the 74th session of its General Assembly. Although Roosevelt did not live to see it, he considered the UN his crowning achievement, providing in Hamilton\u2019s words, \u201cideals that men and women could fight for, not simply against.\u201d For FDR, establishing an international authority that would guarantee the postwar peace was a pivotal war aim.\n\nIn Donald Trump we have a different man. Whereas Roosevelt sought to attract such ideological foes as the Soviet Union in the hope of sufficiently reconciling rivalries to achieve common goals, Trump seeks to inflame differences as he did at the recent G7 conference in Biarritz where he baited our allies on tariffs and global warming.", "description": "Labor Day reminds us of our great domestic progress that Trump attacks daily. And the upcoming UN Summit remind us that Trump's destruction doesn't end at our borders.", "authors": ["Jack Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567362599/190901-schwartz-fdr-tease_lqxkmc"}
