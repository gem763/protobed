CLICK HERE to see why Richie McCaw will make history for New Zealand at the Millennium Stadium\n\nGoing up against the All Blacks is always an exciting challenge \u2014 especially when you face guys like Julian Savea. He is a fantastic winger and some people have said he is even better than Jonah Lomu . . . but Jonah will always be the man in my opinion!\n\nSavea is an exceptional athlete who gets himself in the right place at the right time. He takes his chances very well and pops up where people don\u2019t want to see him. His scoring record speaks for itself but it\u2019s unfair to compare him to Lomu, because who knows how good Lomu could have been with all the facilities we have in the modern game?\n\nThe New Zealand squad is oozing quality and Savea is just one example. Sonny Bill Williams is a player I love to watch and he\u2019s shown his quality by switching straight back from rugby league to international rugby union.\n\nGeorge North cannot wait to face New Zealand at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday\n\nNorth (third right) and team-mates react after a poor performance against Fiji in their previous Autumn Test\n\nThen there\u2019s Richie McCaw, the face of the All Blacks. He will captain the side for the 100th time on Saturday and that sums up the man \u2026 most players don\u2019t get up to 100 Tests, let alone as skipper.\n\nThey do have an aura about them because they are the world\u2019s best team. It\u2019s the same with any sports team who are at the top of their game. We just have to go in with confidence and belief in our own abilities, which is something we all have. Over the past few games they have shown they\u2019re human and they do make mistakes. I guess what sets them apart is that even when they\u2019re on the back foot, they still manage to grind out the results. Hopefully we can push them over the edge.\n\nOn a personal note, I can\u2019t wait to face the haka again. Some people say it gives New Zealand an unfair advantage and should be banned, but it\u2019s a tradition of the game and I think it should carry on.\n\nIt\u2019s supposed to be intimidating, but if you can\u2019t handle it then you\u2019re probably not going to be able to manage a game of international rugby either.\n\nI first faced it in 2010 \u2014 it was quite daunting as an 18-year-old lad but it\u2019s just part of the game.\n\nJulian Savea has been compared to New Zealand rugby legend Jonah Lomu\n\nRichie McCaw will make history by captaining the All Blacks for a 100th Test on Saturday\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland (right) leads a training session after the 'disappointment' of the Fiji win\n\nFiji had their own war dance last weekend, but the less said about that game the better. It was a tough day for everyone involved and we know we didn\u2019t perform well. Warren Gatland was like a disappointed dad in the changing room afterwards. It was one of those \u2018I\u2019m not angry\u2026 I\u2019m disappointed,\u2019 moments. Our basic skills weren\u2019t there and we got turned over 22 times. That\u2019s not acceptable in international rugby; it was schoolboy level and we let ourselves down. Now we pick ourselves up and get ready to raise our game against the All Blacks.\n\nWe had a funny quiz on Monday night that was organised by Gethin Jenkins.\n\nIt was a chance to get all the boys together and have a laugh. I was put in a team with Rhys Webb, James Hook and Dan Biggar. On paper we should have won it but we only managed fourth place. The team captained by Bradley Davies took the trophy in the end . . . I\u2019m not quite sure how that happened!\n\nJamie Roberts and Nemani Nadolo, the huge Fijian centre, swapped shirts after the game on Saturday.\n\nJamie likes to think he\u2019s the big man but Nadolo beat him there . . . he was massive! It\u2019s safe to say Nadolo\u2019s shirt might be a bit baggy on the Doc!\n\nNorth is a massive fan of New Zealand's war dance the haka, performed here against Scotland\n\nJamie Roberts (right) met his match when he swapped shirts with Fiji's Nemani Nadola (left)\n\nWe\u2019ve been following the progress of the Wales football team in camp.\n\nThey\u2019re doing really well at the moment \u2014 drawing 0-0 with Belgium on Sunday \u2014 and that\u2019s good to see. I\u2019m not the biggest football lover but if I had to pick a team then it would probably be Liverpool. Justin Tipuric and Dan Biggar are the biggest fans in the squad and I\u2019m sure they would love it if Gareth Bale came to visit one day.\n\nSome of the lads have got together to create a cookbook for charity.\n\nSam Warburton tried making \u2018James Hook\u2019s Thai Green Curry\u2019 the other day and the feedback was pretty good. I\u2019m not much of a cook myself but my special recipe is carrot cake. We get most of our food provided for us but Liam Williams thinks he is a bit of a Jamie Oliver . . . really he\u2019s more of a Happy Meal job!", "description": "The Northampton wing and Sportsmail columnist gives his views on Wales'  showdown with 'the world's best team' New Zealand at the Millenium Stadium on Saturday.", "authors": ["George North For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/11/20/2332640F00000578-0-image-50_1416524228423.jpg", "published_at": "2014-11-20"}
