Every consumer has the right to know exactly what is in their food and how it might affect their bodies. Only with a clear label will consumers be able to make informed choices when they buy food. What\u2019s more, many young children eat junk food every day. If there were warnings on the wrappers, like those on cigarette packets, children would be able to see how junk food can negatively impact their health, and that might help them make healthier snack choices. On a lighter note, junk food is not all that bad, as long as people eat it in moderation. Health warnings would serve as a reminder to make good and balanced food choices.\n\nNatividad Angelica Rubianes, 16, Lai King Catholic Secondary School\n\nWhile junk food in general is hazardous to the human body, everyone should have the human right to freely decide on what they are eating, healthy or not. Putting warnings on junk food would imply that it\u2019s \u201csinful\u201d to taste it. Imagine having the statement \u201cWarning: Despite its enticing flavour, it causes chronic diseases\u201d imprinted on the box of chicken nuggets you newly ordered. Any starving customer would just lose their appetite in a split second and leave the front door.\n\nTalking points: do schools offer enough healthy lunch options?\n\nChoi Nok-him, 12, SKH Tang Shiu Kin Secondary School\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think so. Whether they are teens or adults, those who consume junk food do know it is high in calories and can cause people to become obese or to suffer heart diseases. However, people don\u2019t stop eating junk food because they think it is delicious. Just like smokers don\u2019t give up smoking despite the frightening graphic health warnings on cigarette packages. Instead of adding health warnings, educating students, especially young ones, about making healthy food choices is a more effective method of reducing the consumption of junk food. It is easier for children to get rid of bad food habits and develop healthy ones than adults. Children will also bring home to their parents\u2019 information on the harmful effects of junk food on health, which in the long run can convince adults to eat less junk food.\n\nTommy Cheung, 16, Fung Kai No.1 Secondary School\n\nI think junk food should come with health warnings. Hongkongers seldom spend time on checking the ingredients label, so adding some health warnings is a great way to alert them about some diseases, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, caused by eating junk food. Therefore adding heath warning labels can improve Hong Kong citizens\u2019 health.\n\nTalking points: Should contraception be free for all Hongkongers?\n\nYoonjung Choi, 14, Hong Kong International School\n\nYes, junk food should come with health warnings. Although some junk food companies will be disappointed with this decision, in some cases, it will even help save many lives. I personally enjoy eating candy bars but if the packaging of the candy bar had a picture of decaying teeth or a diseased heart, I would definitely think twice about eating it. These days, new research suggests that just like warnings on cigarette packaging, if there is a negative message on junk food it can prevent people from eating it.\n\nWhile junk food in general is hazardous to the human body, everyone should have the human right to freely decide on what they are eating, healthy or not.
