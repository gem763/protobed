While it was expected, given that the Diwali is celebrated with much fervour since time immemorial, and has historically involved lighting and bursting of firecrackers on a massive scale.\n\nWith the awareness of pollution and growing concerns, strict legislations as well as prohibitions have been put in place to discourage people from causing an adverse impact on the environment, which in turn has almost fatal impact on human beings.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE IMAGE. BCCL\n\nIn this regard, the Supreme Court in 2018 banned polluting firecrackers and ordered that only green firecrackers, which is said to cause 30 per cent less pollution, can be manufactured and sold. Further, the Delhi government headed by its Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also organised a mega laser show in Connaught Place so that people could celebrate the festivities together and refrain from bursting crackers that pollute the atmosphere.\n\nBut despite everything, rules were broken and people did what they wanted and there was perhaps nobody to prevent them from doing so.\n\nDon't Miss 929 SHARES 233 SHARES 779 SHARES 2 K SHARES\n\nNews agency PTI reported violation of the two-hour window in Malviya Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, Kailash Hills, Burari, Jangpura, Shahdara, Laxmi Nagar, Mayur Vihar, Sarita Vihar, Hari Ngar, New Friends Colony, Dwarka among others places. Residents in Noida, Gurgaon and Ghaziabad also reported extensive fireworks much beyond the time-frame. The people could also be seen bursting crackers before 8 PM, however, the intensity remained low.\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE. BCCL\n\nAs a result the air quality in Delhi plummeted to dangerous levels in and around the national capital on Monday. Stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana also doubled in the last 48 hours, adding to the woes of Delhiites.\n\nAnd this set in motion a chain reaction of sorts as people expressed their outrage over the rampant use of firecrackers despite the ban. Some regretted that the pollution has become uncontrollable and demanded stricter punishment for the offenders. At the same time, the social media is also abuzz with everything related to pollution and people seem to be putting the entire blame on the festival whereas we could not be further from the truth.\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE. BCCL\n\nThere is no denying that Diwali witnesses one of the most toxic days in the year and that a lot of hazardous gases are released into the atmosphere from the firecrackers but at the same time we should also remember that Diwali occurs only on one day of the year.\n\nWhat do we do on the other 364 days? Travel in luxurious vehicles that run on diesel and petrol? Fly high in jets that release even more harmful elements into the atmosphere? And our air conditioners, the blessing to mankind that releases tons and tons of CFCs?\n\nFrom our construction industry to the automobile and food processing, pollution is a steady force all through them and it spikes furthermore in military exercises and practises. With every bullet that is fired into the air or shot at in practise, we are releasing equally, if not more dangerous elements, into the atmosphere.\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE. BCCL\n\nAt the end of all the hustle and bustle, we shouldn\u2019t forget that the planet we call home is one and that there is no boundary that the atmosphere respects. All our actions have an impact and whereas going eco-friendly on Diwali is a good thing that needs to be promoted more aggressively, we should also sit back and ask ourselves once whether we really obey eco-friendly norms all through the year or not.\n\nOnly a concerted effort by all and over a prolonged period of time can help reduce the threats of pollution and selective outrage will potentially derail us from looking at the larger picture. This will also be an obstacle in the fight against pollution.", "description": "The residents of India\u2019s national capital, New Delhi, as also of its surrounding areas, woke up on Monday with pollution levels touching severe mark in many locations.
