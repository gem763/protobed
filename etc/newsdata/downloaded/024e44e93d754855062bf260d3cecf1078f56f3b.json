That would allow Germany to boost spending on infrastructure and climate protection up to limits set by the European Union, rather than its national debt brake.\n\nGermany's 10-year Bund yield rose to a one-month high at -0.565%, while longer-dated 30-year bond yields were 10 basis points higher on the day at -0.02% -- within striking distance of positive yield territory.\n\n\"The German story is of some significance,\" said Lyn Graham-Taylor, fixed income strategist at Rabobank.\n\n\"It looks like it (extra spending) will be by a public body not the state directly. Also if you get big fiscal stimulus from Germany, that could make QE (quantitative easing) less likely.\"\n\nMarkets expect the ECB to deliver easing steps that include rate cuts to boost weak growth at Thursday's meeting. But expectations for a fresh round of QE have been tempered by comments from ECB officials in the past two weeks.\n\nThe position adjustment in bond markets continued amid slightly positive signs from economy data, with most longer-dated bond up 10 to 12 basis points .\n\nGerman exports unexpectedly rose in July, suggesting the euro zone's biggest economy may be withstanding some of the impact of tariff disputes and Brexit uncertainty.\n\nA euro zone business sentiment survey also indicated that investor morale improved slightly in September.\n\n\"If there are net new purchases, the ECB would spread these out over the curve, possibly buying more duration. This is why the ultra-long end is more affected (by lowered quantitative easing expectations),\" said Commerzbank rates strategist Rainer Guntermann.\n\n\n\n\n\nEYES ON THE ECB\n\nOverall trade was expected to remain subdued as investors wait to see just what stimulus the ECB delivers this Thursday.\n\n\"With the European Central Bank on tableau for this week I don't expect any significant market movements ahead of the meeting,\" said Rene Albrecht, rates strategist at DZ Bank.\n\nAt the very least, money markets show investors expect a 10 basis point cut in the deposit rate to -0.50% in what would be the first cut since 2016.\n\nSome investors are betting on a bigger 20 bps cut; nearly a quarter of economists polled by Reuters anticipate this too.\n\nNearly 90% of economists polled by Reuters also expect the ECB to announce a return to quantitative easing, starting with monthly asset purchases of 30 billion euros from October.
