Their tickets will be fully refunded, Gilpin said.\n\nJapan, whose capital Tokyo hosts the Olympics next year, is battered by around 20 typhoons per year and is one of the world\u2019s most seismically active countries.\n\nBut Gilpin stressed he had \u201cno regrets at all\u201d about bringing the World Cup to Japan, the first Asian country to host the tournament.\n\n\u201cI think what you\u2019ve all seen over the last three weeks absolutely in every respect vindicates the right decisions to be hosting a World Cup here in Japan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe always knew there were going to be risks. It\u2019s rare for a typhoon of this magnitude to cause this impact this late in the typhoon season.\u201d\n\nHe added that World Rugby had looked \u201cpretty exhaustively\u201d at other options for the games, including switching venues, but \u201cwe couldn\u2019t guarantee consistent contingency plans across all those games safely for all the teams and fans involved\u201d.\n\nSeven games were slated for the final weekend of the pool stage, when matches are tightly packed and cannot be rescheduled. Cancelled games are recorded as 0-0 draws, with both teams awarded two points.\n\nEngland and France have already qualified from Pool C, with Eddie Jones\u2019s men top of the group, but Pool A hangs in the balance ahead of Japan\u2019s final game against Scotland in Yokohama on Sunday.\n\nIf that game were abandoned, Scotland would be eliminated and Japan would qualify for their first quarter-final as shock group winners, with Ireland runners-up.\n\nAustralia\u2019s game against Georgia on Friday will go ahead, as will Saturday\u2019s match between Ireland and Samoa, which is in Fukuoka in Japan\u2019s southwest, out of the predicted path of the storm.\n\nHagibis, packing maximum gusts of up to 270 kilometres (168 miles) per hour, is currently projected to batter the Tokyo and Yokohama area on Saturday.\n\nThe storm \u201cis predicted to be the biggest typhoon of the 2019 season and is highly likely to cause considerable disruption\u2026 including likely public transport shutdown and disruption\u201d, said Gilpin.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Very disappointed\u2019 \u2013\n\nJapan\u2019s Meteorological Agency said Hagibis was currently \u201ca large and violent typhoon\u201d and while it will weaken before hitting the mainland, it will \u201cremain very strong\u201d and have a \u201csignificant impact over large areas\u201d.\n\nHagibis is currently forecast to clip the southeastern corner of Japan near Tokyo and Yokohama but given its size, the impact will be felt across wide swathes of the country.\n\nFormula One organisers also said they were \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d the potential impact of Hagibis ahead of this weekend\u2019s Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, southwest of Tokyo.\n\nIn 2014, Marussia driver Jules Bianchi crashed in bad weather conditions caused by a typhoon, and remained in a coma until his death the following July.\n\nMany people in Chiba, east of Tokyo, are still recovering from Typhoon Faxai, which struck Japan in early September and caused widespread disruption, leaving two people dead and cutting power to half-a-million homes.\n\nHagibis is taking a similar trajectory to Faxai but is nearly three times bigger in terms of area.\n\nOrganisers received immediate criticism for the cancellations, with former World Cup winner Francois Pienaar telling Sky Sports: \u201cEverybody has worked so hard. Why, if you work that hard and prepare yourself, let weather influence the outcome of the match? It shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSimon Learey, a British fan here, said he had flown out for the England-France game after getting the tickets as a birthday present.\n\n\u201cVery disappointed, we\u2019re only here four days, only to see that game,\u201d said Learey.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Rugby World Cup organisers took the unprecedented step Thursday of cancelling two games \u2014 England v France and New Zealand v", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/c8ab62_it-is-time-in-tournament-32-year-history-game-has-cancelled-two-world-cup-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
