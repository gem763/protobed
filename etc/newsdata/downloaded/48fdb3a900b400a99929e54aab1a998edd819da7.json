It was crumbling when one final star added his name to the list of legends.\n\nLegend is too strong a word to describe Juan Soto, the left fielder for the Washington Nationals, at least for now. Soto does not turn 21 until Friday, when his team will host the first World Series game in Washington since 1933. He helped lead the Nationals there with one of the best seasons ever for a player his age: 34 homers, 110 runs batted in and a .949 on-base plus slugging percentage.\n\nHe signed with Washington when he was 16, in 2015, agreeing to a $1.5 million deal in a musty old batting cage at Fort Lauderdale Stadium, the former spring home of the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles. He had been playing in a showcase event at the park, and the Nationals \u2014 who had already seen Soto in the Dominican Republic , his home country \u2014 pulled him away for a private evaluation.\n\n\u201cIt was really nasty in there,\u201d said Johnny DiPuglia, the Nationals\u2019 vice president for international operations. \u201cIt smelled like urine.
