At just $200, it\u2019s much cheaper than the flagship $350 Galaxy Watch and the Apple Watch Series 4. Saving money often means sacrificing features, but the Active doesn\u2019t lose out on much; it\u2019s fast, swim-proof, has built-in GPS, includes a slew of fitness modes, and lasts a long time on a charge. However, it does give up a beloved piece of hardware that\u2019s become a signature of Samsung\u2019s other smartwatches: the rotating bezel. But the Galaxy Watch Active still strikes a very appealing balance for its price. I\u2019d already call it one of the better options for Android users who understand its limitations, which I\u2019ll get into below.\n\nThe Active\u2019s design is fairly generic. It comes in nicer colors than the black variant I reviewed, but all of them share the same understated style that almost looks like something Pebble would have made. It\u2019s not flashy, but it works. The 20mm bands are easy to replace, as well.\n\nThe Galaxy Watch Active\u2019s most shining attribute is comfort. Its aluminum case is far lighter than the stainless steel Galaxy Watch or the Apple Watch Series 4, and it\u2019s thin enough to not get caught up on shirt cuffs or outerwear. The watch rests flat on my wrist, and I quickly forget that I\u2019m wearing it, whereas I never really \u201cforget\u201d that my stainless steel Series 4 is on. It\u2019s such a pleasant fit that I\u2019ve been able to sleep wearing the Active without any discomfort. The watch automatically switches into sleep-tracking mode when it detects that you\u2019ve gone to bed. It breaks down the quality of your sleep based on how long you spent in each phase. None of this is unique among fitness wearables that offer sleep tracking (like a Fitbit), but it\u2019s something the pricier Apple Watch still can\u2019t do natively.\n\nThe trade-off for that comfort is a smaller screen, especially compared to the monstrous 46mm Galaxy Watch. The Active has a 40mm case with a significant bezel running around its 1.1-inch OLED display. I wouldn\u2019t call it cramped, per se \u2014 content on-screen is perfectly legible, and you can tap where you need without many mistakes \u2014 but whereas the latest Apple Watch can sometimes feel like a computer on your wrist, the Galaxy Watch Active doesn\u2019t leave that same impression. Some people might actually prefer that, and Samsung clearly cared more about fit than screen real estate this time around. Speaking of fit, the company includes two sizes of its silicone sport strap in the box; I immediately had to swap for the larger one.\n\nThe rotating bezel is sorely missed\n\nBut Samsung took something very important away from the Galaxy Watch Active: it lacks the rotating bezel that has proven to be an intuitive, natural, and fun control mechanism on the company\u2019s other smartwatches. The Tizen Wearable OS 4.0 software is designed to put the display\u2019s circular shape to good use, but navigating the Galaxy Watch Active can feel more finicky without the rotating bezel and its satisfying clicks.\n\nFor one, the watch\u2019s software doesn\u2019t really take into account this significant change in how you interact with it. The user experience is largely identical to that of the Galaxy Watch, and it\u2019s clearly meant to work best with a rotating bezel that can quickly scroll through menus.\n\nRelying only on taps and swipes (plus the physical back and home buttons) isn\u2019t the end of the world, but it undeniably feels like more work. If the app you tap on in the apps drawer isn\u2019t already highlighted, for example, you\u2019ve got to tap a second time to open it. The Active is at least a pleasure to swipe across with its smooth glass top and curved edges. Your finger won\u2019t be knocking into a raised bezel as with the Galaxy Watch. (Of course, that also means you run a higher risk of a shattered screen if you drop it.)\n\nTizen OS 4.0 runs very fluidly on the Active, which is powered by the same processor as the Galaxy Watch. From the main watchface, you can swipe down from the top for quick toggles / settings, swipe right to view your notifications, or swipe left to move between any widgets (alarms, calendar, music controls, sleep tracking, etc.) you want fast access to. Hold down on the main screen to switch to another watchface or download more; there are thousands of watchfaces available, which, frankly, seems hopeless to navigate through. But at least you\u2019ve got options.\n\nGalaxy Watch Active specs Casing: 40mm\n\nStrap: 20mm\n\nDimensions: 39.5mm x 39.5mm x 10.5mm\n\nWeight (without strap): 25g\n\nDisplay: 1.1-inch OLED (360 x 360)\n\nProcessor: Dual-core Exynos 9110 1.15 GHz\n\nStorage: 4GB\n\nRAM: 750MB\n\nBattery: 230mAh\n\nOS: Tizen OS 4.0\n\nBluetooth: 4.2\n\nNFC: Yes\n\nGPS: Yes\n\nWater resistance: 5ATM and IP68\n\nRuggedness: MIL-STD-810G\n\nWireless charging: Yes (limited compatibility)\n\nWorks with Android, iOS\n\nThe built-in watchfaces were fine for my tastes. You can change the color of some, and others offer customizable complications to display the information most important to you. Samsung\u2019s watchfaces don\u2019t feel quite as data-rich as some of those on the Apple Watch Series 4, but, again, that probably has to do with the modest display. Pit this against a Fitbit Versa, and the comparison swings in Samsung\u2019s favor.\n\nSamsung does a good job of optimizing its wearable apps for a round display, but I still think some of the icons and user interface elements are ugly compared to the Apple Watch or Google\u2019s revamped Wear OS. The company says there have been some visual tweaks inspired by its One UI design guidelines, but they\u2019re barely noticeable. Plus, since Tizen is its own separate operating system, sometimes you\u2019re required to install a \u201ccompanion\u201d app on your Android phone if you download watch apps such as Uber. That feels like unnecessary clutter. Many apps send basic notifications without any useful response actions, but you can customize which ones you want to reach your wrist.\n\nThird-party app selection, in general, on the Active is dismal compared to Apple Watch and Wear OS, though Samsung has a few popular fitness apps like Strava on board. And the included Spotify app lets you download music for offline listening, which the Apple Watch version can\u2019t yet do. That\u2019s good news for runners, and it might be enough to sell some people on the Active. But there\u2019s no such thing as Google Maps or Google Messages for Tizen.\n\nJust as with Samsung\u2019s phones, Bixby is a weak point on the Active. It sometimes fumbles the accuracy of dictated messages, and it will frequently steer you back to your phone for many questions if you go deeper than asking for the weather or telling it to fire off a text. At least Bixby is easier to just ignore when there\u2019s not a dedicated button for it. I don\u2019t foresee people using apps beyond those for music and fitness tracking on the Galaxy Watch Active very often. When you get notifications from messaging or email apps, you can choose from a list of canned responses or add your own custom reply. Failing that, you can scribble out a message letter by letter a la the Apple Watch if you really have no other option.\n\nSamsung Pay is included for wireless payments, but only at terminals that support NFC; Samsung doesn\u2019t include the MST technology found in flagship Galaxy phones that can mimic the magnetic stripe on credit / debit cards, allowing Samsung Pay to be used in many more situations.\n\nIt\u2019s worth underlining that owners of Samsung phones get the best experience from the Galaxy Watch Active. It has versions of the company\u2019s stock email and messaging apps on board, but no such luck for Gmail or Google\u2019s Messages app. That\u2019s disappointing for those using another Android device (or who dislike Samsung\u2019s software). In either case, you\u2019ll need the Galaxy Wearable app installed to get set up and adjust the watch\u2019s settings.\n\nUnfortunately, the watch\u2019s main new health-related feature \u2014 blood pressure detection \u2014 wasn\u2019t yet ready to test at press time. When it does launch, it\u2019ll be in beta. Allow me to reiterate that you shouldn\u2019t trust a consumer gadget to serve as your doctor or a miracle device that can sense all ailments. The Active\u2019s sleep tracking seems fairly on point, automatic workout detection was surprisingly quick to recognize activity, and my daily steps lined up closely with an Apple Watch on my other wrist. So it hits the fundamentals and also has a water resistance rating of 5ATM, meaning even a deep swim won\u2019t damage it.\n\nSamsung\u2019s Health app offers a ton of functionality; aside from collecting your workout totals and showcasing your progress, it can log your nutrition (food, water, and caffeine intake) if you\u2019re willing to consistently input that data. Rounding out fitness, Samsung includes breathing / relaxation apps and a brand-new widget for tracking your weight. And if you\u2019re still for too long, the Active will nudge you to do a set of torso twists rather than stand up.\n\nI\u2019ve been happy with the Galaxy Watch Active\u2019s endurance so far despite the small 230mAh battery inside. Samsung claims it can go for 45 hours on a single charge, but that\u2019s only a realistic number if you\u2019re using GPS rarely (if at all) and keep the always-on display option disabled. Turning that on is a major hit to battery life. With default settings, I\u2019ve been able to get through two work days before needing to charge. The Active can be juiced up when placed on the back of a Galaxy S10 through Samsung\u2019s new PowerShare feature. Plopping it onto my Samsung wireless charging stand didn\u2019t charge it, though, so you\u2019ll need the Duo Dock if you want to go that route.\n\nVery few iPhone owners are going to give much thought to buying a Galaxy Watch Active. For them, the Apple Watch is the objectively better choice. It\u2019s got more apps, the software is nicer and more coherent, and its integration with iOS allows for richer notifications and easy one-tap actions when those notifications warrant a response. You\u2019ll feel a lot more constrained using the Active with iOS than with Android.\n\nSamsung\u2019s real competition is Fitbit with its Versa and products like the Fossil Sport that run Wear OS and are at par with most of the Galaxy Watch Active\u2019s features, albeit for a slightly higher price. At $200, the Galaxy Watch Active is a strong value that I'd probably consider before both of those, assuming you can go without the rotating bezel and won't envy other smartwatches and their bigger screens. Using the Galaxy Watch Active might be less fun than Samsung's other watches, but it's still a good time overall.\n\nPhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge", "description": "The new Galaxy Watch Active from Samsung lacks the company\u2019s signature rotating bezel, but it still strikes a very appealing mix of features for the price.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Mar"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3SCYV3xMDSO0EdsLzyz6Mq_dlU=/0x248:2040x1316/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15944637/DSCF1360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-07"}
