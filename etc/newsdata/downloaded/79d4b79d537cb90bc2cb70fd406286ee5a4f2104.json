I\u2019ve mostly ignored it, but disgust at my own attachment to the device led me to give it a shot. It wasn\u2019t particularly useful for controlling how much I used Twitter. But it did do one thing: It helped me see how hopeless that effort really is.\n\nFifteen minutes. That\u2019s the daily limit I set up for Twitter. I thought this would accommodate just enough time to scan for trends (and calamities), see what people were saying to (or about) me, and then get the hell out again.\n\nJust getting Screen Time set up to do this is not easy. Apple introduced the feature in iOS 12, about a year ago, in an apparent attempt to help curtail the attention-sink hellscape to which its devices largely gave rise. By default, it tracks app usage in the background, presenting a weekly summary in the form of a complex chart that tells you that you look at your phone too much.\n\nTo do something about it, you have to go to the phone settings and create an \u201capp limit.\u201d The phone makes it easy to control usage by app category\u2014social media, or games, or entertainment, for example, though the categories are broad: If you use Twitter or WhatsApp for work, for example, a \u201csocial media\u201d limit will curtail your ability to do so. Not too much, though\u2014you still have the option to \u201cignore limit,\u201d either for 15 minutes more or for the rest of the day. It\u2019s possible to set limits on a single app. But the process is so unintuitive, I can\u2019t remember how I did it (this way, apparently).\n\nI took Twitter off my phone to read more. This morning I re-read T.S. Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land on the train. It\u2019s a panoply of random voices collaged together, impossible to follow, and fills you with dread and despair. And I realized it\u2019s sort of a perfect replacement. \u2014 Paul Ford (@ftrain) August 29, 2019\n\nOnce Screen Time is enabled, the device will dutifully police your session with Twitter (or your chosen poison). First a notification: \u201c5 minutes remaining today.\u201d Then, when the bell tolls, a dour, white screen appears: \u201cTime Limit. You\u2019ve reached your limit on Twitter.\u201d Above it, an hourglass animates to empty. No more Twitter for you today. Once their time is expended, the relevant app icons darken on the home screen, the sad hourglass flanking the app name. It\u2019s as if a severe professor were staring sternly down half-rim spectacles at the device, and then you, and then it, and then you again.\n\nScreen Time was always going to be a punitive matter\u2014the feature was meant to set and enforce boundaries, after all. But all this austerity romanticizes an idea of deliberate focus long gone. The hourglass, for example, is a relic from maritime, clerical, and mercantile life that was mostly replaced more than 500 years ago by the mechanical clock. Historically, Apple has deliberately avoided this icon: The first Macintosh interface used a stylish-looking wristwatch to clock away time while the computer worked (Susan Kare, who designed it, thought people would be familiar with a watch but not an hourglass, which the earlier Apple Lisa had used). Now it uses that infuriating beach ball. It was Windows, Microsoft\u2019s operating system, that popularized measuring delays by hourglass. Putting one on the sleek, black rectangle of your iPhone thus concocts a syrupy m\u00e9lange of lithe modernism and ascetic medievalism.", "description": "It didn\u2019t go well.", "authors": ["Ian Bogost"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/IMG_3301_1/facebook.jpg?1567621705", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
