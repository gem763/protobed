He is now devastated, sad. We spoke yesterday and Sunday night and this morning.\n\n\"He trained normally with the group but he is devastated. He is sad about that situation.\n\n(Image: Visionhaus)\n\n\"His commitment is great every time. He wants to help. His behaviour was perfect in training, with the group and club. Really he knows he was wrong.\n\n\"He feels inside, very deep. It's normal as a human. Every player needs the supporters' support.\"\n\nXhaka has received both criticism and support following Sunday's match.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nSenior Gunners players have reportedly visited him at his house to offer him comfort, while Emery spoke to him on the phone.\n\nBut pundits including former Arsenal stars Ian Wright and Charlie Nicolas have hit out at the midfielder's actions.\n\n\"Players getting booed is not the best, but this is the captain,\" said Wright on Match of the Day.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"They are frustrated that he hasn't run off the pitch. I've seen him before bolt off when he's substituted. He's walked off and then he goads them.\n\n\"We're talking about fans who have watched him play a handful of good games in three years. And he's treating them like that.\"", "description": "The Arsenal midfielder had a run-in with the Gunners supporters during Sunday's draw with Crystal Palace", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Etienne Laurent Epa-Efe Rex", "Visionhaus", "Reuters", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20738518.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-FC-pre-match-press-conference-and-training-in-California-Los-Angeles-USA-16-Jul-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
