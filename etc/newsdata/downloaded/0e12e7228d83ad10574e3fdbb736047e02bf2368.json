Joe Biden, a Man, Tried to Take Credit for Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Work", "language": "en", "text": "From ELLE\n\nAfter Tuesday's Democratic primary debate, there's no doubt that the 2020 presidential candidates perceive Elizabeth Warren as a threat. Throughout the night, candidates were coming at the Senator full force, clearly reacting to recent polls that show her climbing to the top of the pack.\n\nBut one incident in particular left some voters reeling. Toward the end of the debate, Warren started to speak about her work opening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in response to the financial crisis of 2008, one of her signature achievements.\n\nIn a remarkable confrontation, Biden repeatedly told Warren, \"I got you votes\" after she spoke about opening the CFPB, one of her signature achievements.\n\n\n\n\"I am deeply grateful to President Obama,\" Warren replied, \"who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" pic.twitter.com/Ik5aplt0D9\n\n\n\n\u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) October 16, 2019\n\nShe explained, \"Following the financial crash of 2008, I had the idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, \u2018Don\u2019t even try because you will never get it passed.\u2019 And sure enough, the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law.\"\n\nBut when she was finished with her statement, Biden cut in and said: \"I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes! I got votes for that bill! I convinced people to vote for it! So let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\"\n\nAnd with all the calm and aplomb of a woman who knows what it's like to have a man take credit for her work, Warren responded, \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law.\" It was then that Biden interrupted her to say, \"You did a hell of a job at your job,\" to which Warren paused and said, \"Thank you.\"\n\nThe moment did not go unnoticed on Twitter, and many were simply stunned at the exchange. Others couldn't help but relate to Warren's deft handling of a man trying to overshadow her accomplishment. Below, some of the best reactions:\n\nAt a stunning moment during Tuesday's debate, former Vice President Joe Biden interrupted Sen.
