Reporting to Freddie Mac Chief Executive David Brickman, Mr. Nazzaro will lead the information-technology division while setting an overall technology strategy. He joined Freddie Mac last year as chief technology officer.\n\nThe challenge for the mortgage industry is the need to balance aggressive IT modernization efforts with minimizing the impact to customers and end users, Mr. Nazzaro said. \u201cAnd, of chief importance, it must be done in a secure way,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe overarching goal of this work is to improve velocity, reduce cost and increase quality throughout the mortgage process,\u201d Mr. Nazzaro said.\n\nHe said Freddie has a range of digital initiatives under way, including the use of advanced analytics, machine learning and other emerging tools aimed at making processes more efficient and better managing risk.\n\nThe nearly 50-year old company, whose full name is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., isn\u2019t a mortgage lender. Instead, it buys and repackages loans as mortgage-backed securities, competing with other loan-pooling groups such as banks, insurers and Fannie Mae, its larger cousin.\n\nFannie and Freddie were seized by the government during the financial crisis for taking on too much risk without a sufficient cushion for potential losses. The Trump administration is seeking to return them to private hands.\n\nBy boosting the supply of money available for mortgages, Fannie and Freddie can help increase loan approvals, leading to more home sales.\n\nFreddie Mac\u2019s ability to quickly and accurately gauge lending risk is critical, both for its own health and for the U.S. economy. Mortgage-backed securities played a key role in the financial crisis.\n\nMr. Brickman said in a statement that Mr. Nazzaro\u2019s appointment comes at \u201cthe right moment to deliver technology solutions that make us faster, smarter and more efficient.\u201d\n\nFreddie Mac has ramped up its use of digital tools in recent years. It has also experimented with a tech strategy known as agile, a streamlined approach to software development popularized by Silicon Valley firms. Its digital assets include decades of lending data.\n\nMr. Nazzaro said he wants to empower small teams across the company\u2019s business and technology divisions to work more collaboratively and efficiently, including by integrating agile practices.\n\nAmong other projects, a few years ago Freddie developed a mobile app designed to make it easier for its staff to buy apartment loans in the secondary mortgage market, in part by combining loan data with Google Maps tools. The app replaced the manual process of printing out pages of maps and cross-referencing property listings.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal Reported that earlier this year, Freddie began testing software from ZestFinance, a financial-technology firm. The software is aimed at improving the accuracy of risk-prediction models by parsing a wider range of a mortgage applicant\u2019s financial history, including income and borrowing data, beyond a standard credit report.\n\nPeople familiar with the discussions between Freddie and ZestFinance said the aim isn\u2019t to loosen lending standards but to approve applicants who are more financially responsible than stand-alone factors like their credit scores or down-payment amounts suggest.\n\nWrite to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com", "description": "Freddie Mac\u2019s acting chief information officer, Frank Nazzaro, is taking on the role permanently as the mortgage-finance company looks to digital technology to increase loan approvals for a wider group of qualified home buyers.", "authors": ["Angus Loten", "Angus.Loten Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FG598_Nazzar_SOC_20191021155649.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
