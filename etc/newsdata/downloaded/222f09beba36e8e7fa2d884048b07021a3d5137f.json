He\u2019s a real leader and he\u2019s shown that again on Thursday.\n\nJohnny Sexton with head coach Joe Schmidt (Getty)\n\n\u201cYou know just during the week all the micro chats he\u2019ll be having, and not just with the same players over and over again, he goes and seeks players out.\n\n\u201cHe gets what he wants out of them. He has so much experience and knowledge of the game that you have to take on board whatever he says.\n\n\u201cWhen you reflect on what he says you sometimes end up looking back at the video and realising he\u2019s dead right.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so accurate in what he says to you. And he can make you a better player just by you talking to him.\u201d\n\nPA\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Ireland made to work for bonus-point victory over Russia", "description": "Johnny Sexton\u2019s ability to predict what happens next on the pitch has ensured the World Player of the Year is peerless, according to teammate Chris Farrell.The Leinster fly-half remains the talisman on whom Ireland hang their Rugby World Cup ambitions, with boss Joe Schmidt confident the 34-year-old", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Gj2jcZdXnbe_yJWAXBcMLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03OTA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gh1jK80l5KBSvmm264p3aA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/852aa9e8aedef14c383cb6f112d35b9c", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
