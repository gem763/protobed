General manager Jim Nill said Perry wouldn\u2019t skate for two weeks, and the Oct. 3 season opener at home against Boston is less than three weeks away.\n\nThe 34-year-old spent his first 14 seasons with Anaheim before signing a $1.5 million, one-year contract with Dallas. Perry was limited to a career-low 31 games last season because of a knee injury.\n\nPerry said he didn\u2019t have any issues with the knee in the offseason. He said the foot injury was \u201cfrustrating, obviously, two days before camp.\u201d The four-time All-Star is third in Anaheim franchise history with 776 points (372 goals, 404 assists) in 988 games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dallas Stars forward Corey Perry has a broken foot that could sideline him for the opener with his new team.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
