REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will lease a quarter of its strategic petroleum reserve in Padur to Saudi Aramco to store about 4.6 million barrels of oil, a government official said on Wednesday, as New Delhi seeks global investment in its expanding energy infrastructure.\n\nGlobal oil producers are eager to gain a foothold in India, where fuel demand is expected to keep rising as the country\u2019s economy grows.\n\nIndian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd, a government company charged with building oil storage, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Saudi state firm for its participation in the 2.5-million-tonne facility in Karnataka state.\n\n\u201cAramco has signed an MoU for only one compartment,\u201d said HPS Ahuja, chief executive of the Indian company.\n\nThe Padur storage facility has four equal-sized compartments.\n\nSo far, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co is the only foreign company storing oil in India\u2019s strategic reserves, at Mangalore, also in Karnataka. Last year it signed a preliminary agreement to use half of the Padur reserve.\n\nAhuja said Aramco would have to keep some of the 4.6 million barrels for India\u2019s strategic needs, but could sell the rest to Indian refiners.\n\nIndia, which relies on imports for about 80% of its oil needs, has underground emergency storage in three locations to protect against any supply disruption. The reserves can hold 36.87 million barrels.", "description": "India will lease a quarter of its strategic petroleum reserve in Padur to Saudi Aramco to store about 4.6 million barrels of oil, a government official said on Wednesday, as New Delhi seeks global investment in its expanding energy infrastructure.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446470129&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0KP", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
