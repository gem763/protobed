Why Political Influence in Foreign Policy Matters", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A July 25 call between President Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine is the basis for an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump withheld U.S. military aid until Ukrainian officials investigated former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nLast week, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, effectively acknowledged the quid pro quo, although he said the aid was in part contingent on Ukraine\u2019s investigating Trump\u2019s widely debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for hacking Democratic Party emails in 2016. The theory is politically helpful to Trump because it would show he was elected president without that Russian help.\n\nMulvaney was unapologetic in his remarks. \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters at the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d (He later reversed himself and has said his comments were misconstrued.)\n\nReaders have asked The New York Times to explain why, exactly, another nation\u2019s interference in the democratic process is such a serious issue.\n\nHere are some answers.\n\nWhy don\u2019t we want foreign countries involved in our elections?\n\nOther countries have their own interests, and those interests don\u2019t always match ours, said Trevor Potter, the founder of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group that works to ensure fair elections.\n\n\u201cMany countries are rivals of ours and of our democratic system,\u201d Potter said. He listed as two chief examples China and Russia, countries that Trump has publicly suggested could help him achieve his political aims. \u201cIn some cases, they\u2019re going to want policies that help them and therefore hurt us. In other cases, though, they just want us to fail.\u201d\n\nTrump administration officials \u2014 but not the president himself \u2014 have publicly and repeatedly warned foreign governments not to meddle in U.S. elections.\n\nAre protections against this kind of thing in place?\n\nYes. The ability of a foreign nation to gain access and influence over the U.S. democratic process has been a concern since the early days of the republic.\n\nDuring the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787, delegates debated what kind of behavior should merit a president\u2019s removal from office. George Mason suggested the standard of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which holds to this day. One of the high crimes the framers had in mind was accepting money from a foreign power, or what Alexander Hamilton said was giving in to \u201cthe desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.\u201d\n\nIn short, the authors of the Constitution saw few bigger threats than a president corruptly tied to forces from overseas.\n\nWhat was the quid pro quo on the Ukraine call?\n\nTrump has denied any explicit quid pro quo \u2014 a favor or advantage granted or expected in return for something \u2014 in his call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He has repeatedly referred to it as a \u201cperfect\u201d conversation.\n\nBut several elements of the call could conceivably have been used as bargaining chips by Trump.\n\nOne was the U.S. military aid, which came to nearly $400 million for security assistance to help Ukraine fight Russian aggression on its eastern border. The other was a proposed Oval Office meeting between Zelenskiy and Trump, highly desired by Zelenskiy as a powerful show of U.S. support at a time when Ukraine is under threat from Russia.\n\nAccording to a summary of the call released by the White House, Trump raised two matters after Zelenskiy spoke of his need for U.S. help. \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though,\u201d Trump said, shifting the conversation to ask Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens as well as the conspiracy theory.\n\nZelenskiy responded that his prosecutor general would look into those issues, and asked Trump to provide any additional information that could aid in the investigation.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem?\n\nAt its most basic level, asking another government for help \u2014 whether a quid pro quo existed or not \u2014 means that Trump would find himself indebted to another country.\n\nDoing this in private is especially alarming, Potter said, because the Trump administration\u2019s decision to even temporarily withhold military aid for a country that needs to arm itself against Russia goes directly against U.S. national security interests.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- A July 25 call between President Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine is the basis for an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump withheld U.S. military aid until Ukrainian officials investigated former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Last week, the acting White House chief", "authors": ["Katie Rogers"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3eF2QY5FBt58BNQkV81dWA--~B/aD0yMjAwO3c9MzMwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/56c0ded27720df738120109434e15a4a", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
