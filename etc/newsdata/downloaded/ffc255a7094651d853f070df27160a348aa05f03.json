Comey, who oozes sneering self-righteousness, is brazenly claiming vindication while lashing out at his critics. Sadly, this sort of unseemly unprofessionalism is not unexpected at this point:\n\nDOJ IG \"found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.\" I don\u2019t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a \u201csorry we lied about you\u201d would be nice. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) August 29, 2019\n\n\n\nThe little lecture wasn't over:\n\nAnd to all those who\u2019ve spent two years talking about me \u201cgoing to jail\u201d or being a \u201cliar and a leaker\u201d\u2014ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) August 29, 2019\n\n\n\nIt's certainly true that some critics went too far in their attacks and conjecture; confidently predicting legal outcomes can often backfire. But pretending as if the IG findings debunk the notion that he's a leaker is effectively a lie unto itself -- so \"liar and a leaker\" sounds about right:\n\nFinal lines of IG report on Comey, on page 61:\n\n\n\n\"What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment...\"\n\n\n\n\"...in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.\" pic.twitter.com/zeKitNFRwp \u2014 Andrew Clark (@AndrewHClark) August 29, 2019\n\nIG report details how Comey, after he was fired, leaked (via text message) a memo he personally believed was evidence of obstruction on the Flynn investigation to the New York Times.\n\n\n\nThe NYT published a story that same day. pic.twitter.com/GtgaIb4tYD \u2014 Andrew Clark (@AndrewHClark) August 29, 2019\n\n\n\nAn \"unauthorized disclosure\" is official speak for a leak. And as the IG points out, Comey's leaking was undertaken to \"achieve a personally desired outcome.\" A political agenda and/or personal vendetta. That seems healthy coming from the guy who ran the FBI for years. Comey surely views his actions as heroic, truth-telling endeavors -- but that's how he seems to view all of his own conduct. Despite being weary and beleaguered, I shall heroically press on, which is what heroic heroes such as myself do in pursuit of heroism:\n\nTonight, I told a former colleague that I\u2019m tired of being a Trump critic. He responded with encouraging words that apply to all of us: \u201cWhere you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country.\u201d He\u2019s right. Keep speaking out. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) August 28, 2019\n\n\n\nInsufferable. As he omits, glides over and downplays his own demonstrable misconduct, in favor of a self-serving narrative, Comey will undoubtedly cast himself as a guardian of truth and justice. As he does so, please recall his early and vocal (later rocky) support for Andrew McCabe. McCabe was fired for repeatedly lying under oath to federal investigators...about leaking. That firing was spurred by previous findings from the nonpartisan Inspector General, and was recommended by career nonpartisan ethics officials at DOJ. McCabe, much like Peter Strzok, was not a victim. Neither is Comey. In case you missed it, I'll leave you with this:\n\nCNN reports on \u201cdamning\u201d IG report on Comey violating FBI policeshttps://t.co/zTHFc6JQt4 pic.twitter.com/vMqYMttIia \u2014 RNC Research (@RNCResearch) August 29, 2019\n\n\n\nThey're going to hire him soon, aren't they?", "description": "Agenda Driven, Self-Righteous..09/02/2019 3:25:59AM EST.", "authors": ["Guy Benson", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/355/72e025ae-19d4-4007-886f-9044f6089bb1.png"}
