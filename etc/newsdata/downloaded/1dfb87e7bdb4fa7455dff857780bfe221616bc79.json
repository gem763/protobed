To save money on legal costs, the NHS needs to focus on reducing the number of medical errors so there are fewer innocent victims needing our help.\n\n\u2018All the costs and damages in our cases were approved by either the NHS and its solicitors or the courts.\u2019\n\nNHS Resolution told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018Sometimes it is necessary to defend cases or challenge the amount claimed in the interests of the taxpayer.\n\n\u2018We take a robust approach to excessive legal costs and fully support the work under way to tackle this issue so that access to justice can be delivered at a reasonable and proportionate cost.\u2019\n\nThe spokesman added that cases going to mediation now outnumber those going to trial by six to one.", "description": "The \u00a3411 million bill - an average of \u00a31.1 million a day - would pay for 17,000 new nurses or 24,000 kidney transplants.
