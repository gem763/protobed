She\u2019s left a family in complete ruin. We\u2019re broken.\u2019\n\nLondon and Washington were locked in an extraordinary standoff last night over the issue. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has been urging US ambassador Woody Johnson and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to reconsider their protection for Mrs Sacoolas.\n\nMrs Sacoolas, who had her 12-year-old son in the car when the crash happened, was spoken to by police the following day \u2013 August 28 \u2013 and said she had no plans to leave the UK.\n\nOfficers became aware immunity was an issue because her husband was a diplomat and applied to the US embassy for a waiver to allow them to question her.\n\nBut they were later informed the waiver had been refused and Mrs Sacoolas had left the country.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Official Spokesman said: \u2018The Foreign Secretary spoke with Secretary of State Pompeo last night and reiterated our position that we want the US to reconsider their decision.\n\n\u2018The Prime Minister\u2019s view is that it is not right that diplomatic immunity can be used for this purpose and we hope than Anne Sacoolas will come back to the UK and engage properly with the processes of law.\n\n\u2018The Prime Minister has said that if this issue is not resolved he will take it up with the president. That remains the case.\u2019\n\nHe would not give a firm timescale in which that might happen but added: \u2018This is clearly a pressing matter for the UK.'", "description": "A lawyer has claimed that the husband of an American woman who was granted diplomatic immunity after Harry Dunn was killed in a car crash in Northampton, isn't actually on the official list.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19446676-0-image-a-25_1570545171672.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
