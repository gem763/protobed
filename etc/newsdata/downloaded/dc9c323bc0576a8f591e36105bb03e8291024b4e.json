The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to take a stand on minimum seat room in the next few weeks, and the ability to safely evacuate an aircraft will be an important factor.\n\nIt won\u2019t be the only factor, of course. Personal space on planes is more scarce than ever. The FAA will also have to decide when a seat is too uncomfortable, in accordance with a congressional mandate.\n\nBut how, exactly, do you evacuate a plane? It turns out the answer is pretty simple and involves staying informed, following the crew\u2019s instructions, and moving fast. Really fast.\n\nThe odds of you having to flee a burning plane are remote, at least in the United States. Most evacuations are orderly and anticlimactic. This year, for example, authorities evacuated a Norwegian Air Shuttle plane after receiving a bomb threat. Passengers disembarked in small groups.\n\nBut in an emergency, the evacuation is rushed. For instance, passengers used all available exits and the emergency slides to flee an Air Transat flight that made an emergency landing in Newark after a fire was reported in the cargo hold.\n\nAnd unfortunately, sometimes the evacuation will be a life-or-death situation. That was the case when an Aeroflot jet made an emergency landing in Moscow in May, bursting into flames. The passengers in the rear of the aircraft couldn\u2019t escape the fire, and 41 people died.\n\nWhat\u2019s the likelihood of that repeating itself in the United States? Greater than you would think, says Greg Raymond, a retired airport rescue firefighter and battalion chief. It\u2019s not just that passengers don\u2019t know what to do during an emergency. They also don\u2019t know where to go.\n\n\u201cMost people have no idea that the overwing exit exists,\u201d Raymond says. \u201cThey think they are just going to go to the nearest cabin door, pull the handle, deploy the slide and then exit the plane.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a little more to it.\n\nYou\u2019ll find emergency evacuation instructions on a card in your seat pocket. Take a look at the card, and find the exit near you. It might be behind you. As Raymond notes, it might also be an overwing exit, which you can reach from the emergency exit row.\n\nThat brings me to one of the complaints I hear most often from airline crew members. Hardly anyone pays attention to the preflight briefing, which contains important safety information. It\u2019s gotten worse since airlines relaxed their rules on in-flight use of electronic devices. Now it\u2019s too easy to continue checking emails and text messages.\n\n\u201cCount the rows between you and the nearest exit,\u201d advises Mateusz Maszczynski, a flight attendant who publishes Paddleyourownkanoo.com, a blog for airline crew members. \u201cIf visibility is seriously reduced, you\u2019ll need this information to get to an exit quickly.\u201d\n\nSo what happens if there\u2019s an emergency landing? Again, the crew will give you instructions. There probably will still be time to count the number of seats between you and the nearest exit. Experts say you should have that exit in your sights. But in some situations, the cabin fills with smoke, and you\u2019ll have to feel your way toward the exit.\n\nLeave all your belongings behind. A video of the survivors in the Moscow crash shows them fleeing the burning plane with their carry-on luggage. Some observers have speculated that time spent retrieving luggage may have contributed to passenger deaths.\n\nFederal regulations require that it must be possible to evacuate an airplane with more than 44 passenger seats within a certain amount of time, usually 90 seconds. The simulated emergency conditions used for testing evacuation procedures assume that passengers can walk and aren\u2019t carrying luggage.\n\nAs soon as you receive crew instructions to exit, get out \u2014 quickly. Every second counts, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe ability to evacuate an airplane, by federal standards, is predicated upon people moving out of the aircraft swiftly, moving toward the closest exit,\u201d says Jason Harris, an international airline pilot. \u201cThe more time each person takes to move, the less time folks behind them have to exit the aircraft. The more time it takes to exit the aircraft, the more intense and dangerous the situation becomes.\u201d\n\nIt seems a successful aircraft evacuation may depend, in equal parts, on alertness, compliance and speed. But what happens to the carry-on you left behind? And what about your checked luggage?\n\nThere are no special provisions for luggage destroyed in a crash. For domestic flights, the government caps an airline\u2019s maximum liability at $3,500. That\u2019s the most that airlines have to pay a passenger for a lost bag. They may pay more, but they don\u2019t have to.\n\nIn short, always pack light and leave your valuables at home. You won\u2019t be able to take them with you in case of an evacuation, and the airline probably won\u2019t compensate you for them.\n\nThen again, maybe legendary test pilot Chuck Yeager said it best. When I asked him about evacuations, he repeated one of the best one-liners in aviation.\n\n\u201cIf you can walk away from a landing,\u201d he told me, \u201cit\u2019s a good landing.\u201d", "description": "An emergency evacuation takes alertness, compliance and speed.
