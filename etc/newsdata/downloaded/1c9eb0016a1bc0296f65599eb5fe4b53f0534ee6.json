And it\u2019s winning.", "language": "en", "text": "Ben Sasse, a Republican, represents Nebraska in the U.S. Senate.\n\nIf you want to understand what\u2019s happening in the National Basketball Association, turn off SportsCenter and pick up \u201cThe Art of War.\u201d More than 2,000 years ago, the Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote that \u201cthe skillful strategist defeats the enemy without doing battle, captures the city without laying siege, overthrows the enemy state without protracted war.\u201d That\u2019s how the NBA lost its recent battle with China, and it\u2019s how China has been beating Americans the past few years.\n\nLet\u2019s back up.\n\nOn Oct. 4, Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests. Of course, almost no one in China saw this tweet given that the country\u2019s ban on Twitter keeps Chinese citizens in dark. Nevertheless, this small, symbolic gesture of solidarity with human rights-seekers landed the NBA in the middle of the war between Chinese techno-authoritarianism and U.S. democracy.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party mobilized immediately. The Chinese Basketball Association severed ties with the Houston Rockets, Chinese corporations canceled lucrative deals, and CCTV (Beijing\u2019s state-run media company) and Tencent (the tech giant that\u2019s in bed with Beijing) declared that they\u2019d be blacklisting Rockets games. Millions of viewers and billions of dollars were on the line.\n\nThe NBA quickly surrendered. The league pushed Morey to apologize, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver followed suit. Even worse, Joe Tsai, the owner of the Brooklyn Nets and co-founder of the quasi-state enterprise Alibaba, parroted Beijing\u2019s Orwellian spin that Hong Kong protesters are less pro-democracy than they are a \u201cseparatist movement.\u201d\n\nThe NBA has prided itself on free expression. Its players and owners have a well-earned reputation for speaking out on social justice in the United States. Sadly, it seems woke capitalism stops at the water\u2019s edge. And this goes way beyond basketball; it is part of Beijing\u2019s strategy of corporate encirclement straight out of Sun Tzu.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party and the American people are locked in conflict. We have been for years. Recently, we have fought with cyberweapons and cyberespionage, but the biggest share of this war has been waged with businesses. That\u2019s part of the problem.\n\nWith a population of 1.4 billion, China is a lucrative market. But getting into that market isn\u2019t cheap. At best, the price of doing business in China is silence; at worst, it\u2019s reading talking points straight from the Chinese Communist Party. Beijing is not subtle about it.\n\nChina is making an example out of the NBA. The Global Times, the government\u2019s propaganda newspaper, warned Western businesses that \u201cglobal brands better stay away from politics.\u201d In its typical threatening tone, the Communist Party laid it all bare: \u201cThe biggest lesson which can be drawn from the matter is that entities that value commercial interests must make their members speak cautiously.\u201d\n\nThe message is inescapably clear: If you\u2019re a U.S. company, the only acceptable position is the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s position:\n\nThe kid in Hong Kong they shot at point-blank range? Don\u2019t mention it. The Muslims they torture in \u00adre-education camps? Don\u2019t object. The threat to Taiwan? Tread carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The NBA\u2019s surrender is nothing new. American businesses have been silent for years as C-suite executives chased Chinese markets for higher profits. But, like Sun Tzu\u2019s enemies, we\u2019ve found ourselves encircled, playing by China\u2019s rules and struggling to keep up.\n\nCommunists aren\u2019t seizing businesses; they\u2019re co-opting them. Just last week, Apple took HKmap.live off its App Store after Beijing complained that Hong Kong protesters were using it to organize. ESPN not only warned its employees to avoid talking about the Hong Kong protests but also described the pro-democracy protests as \u201canti-government.\u201d Even worse, the network used a propaganda map of China that includes the South China Sea as Chinese territory, despite the fact that U.S. sailors are patrolling there to prevent that annexation. Clothing manufacturers, hotels and airlines have been forced to adopt the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official talking points about its supposed ownership of Tibet and Taiwan.\n\nWe\u2019ve lost the opening battles, but we\u2019re not fated to lose the war.\n\nU.S. businesses must step up to the plate and aggressively confront China\u2019s intimidation campaign. And if they don\u2019t have the courage and integrity to fight back, American consumers should demand that our companies put basic human rights above profit margins. The U.S. government has a role to play, too; Washington needs to stem the rising tide of Chinese intellectual property theft and cyberattacks so that we can empower American businesses to take a tougher stand. If free and open societies don\u2019t wake up to this geopolitical reality, we\u2019re going to be encircled before there\u2019s time to fight back.\n\nSun Tzu\u2019s ancient maxims don\u2019t command our destiny. We\u2019re not going down without a fight. We ought to have the courage of our convictions and confidence in our own ingenuity.\n\nAfter all, that\u2019s what America is all about. Either that, or learn Mandarin.", "description": "The Communist Party isn\u2019t seizing our companies.
