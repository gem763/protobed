Earlier on Wednesday, Facebook rejected a plea from Biden to take down a 30-second Trump campaign ad that CNN refused to air because it made false claims about the former vice president. Biden made a similar request to Twitter, which has yet to respond.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s near-daily attempts to tie Biden to corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China are at the center of that battle \u2014 and both allegations have roots in Schweizer\u2019s work. Schweizer, who is also president of the Government Accountability Institute, a nonprofit founded by former Breitbart executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon, helped push the Uranium One allegations against Hillary Clinton.\n\nSchweizer\u2019s 2018 book is also the source of repeated claims by Trump that Hunter Biden made $1.5 billion in corrupt dealings with China, which The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker called \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Times op-ed on Wednesday, which identifies Schweizer as \u201can investigative journalist,\u201d ran under the headline \u201cWhat Hunter Biden Did Was Legal \u2014 And That\u2019s the Problem.\u201d He argues that the vice president\u2019s son used his father\u2019s influence to make money in Ukraine and China, and that Washington should pass tougher financial disclosure laws for politicians\u2019 relatives.\n\nIn his letter to the Times, Biden\u2019s campaign complains that the piece makes \u201cmore malicious claims about the Biden family.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite voluminous work done by the independent press and fact-checkers \u2014 including some by The Times \u2014 to refute the heinous conspiracy theory that Donald Trump attempted to bully Ukraine into propping-up for him, the paper ran an op-ed by none other than Peter Schweizer, making more malicious claims about the Biden family,\u201d Bedingfield wrote in the letter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the statement, the Times spokesman defended the decision to run the op-ed, which also takes aim at alleged profiteering by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) through his own ties to China.\n\n\u201cIt was published by Opinion where their mission is to invite intelligent discussion on a range of opinions and ideas,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe op-ed makes an argument that nonpartisan government watchdogs would make, arguing in favor of a law that would prohibit self-dealing by those with government connections.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Joe Biden's campaign cried foul over the Times\u2019s decision to run an op-ed by Peter Schweizer, a conservative author behind many of President Trump's unsubstantiated claims of corruption against the former vice president.", "authors": ["Tim Elfrink", "Editor Of The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GWh4QLtgy8NInnOdi3AdVWtJvAQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BHFB25FZFUI6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
