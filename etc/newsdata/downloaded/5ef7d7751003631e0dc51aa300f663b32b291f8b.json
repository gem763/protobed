Max Boot tries to pretend he didn\u2019t totally suggest that al-Baghdadi was courageous for blowing himself and his kids up", "language": "en", "text": "As Twitchy told you earlier, Max Boot took a beating for suggesting that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was not, in fact, a coward as Trump had described him because al-Baghdadi opted to blow himself (and three of his kids) up rather than be taken alive.\n\nWe had to use Mandel\u2019s tweet because it contains a screenshot of Boot\u2019s now-deleted hot take. So, why\u2019d Boot delete it, anyway? Well, as it turns out, Boot had made a mistake. You see, he had \u201cwrongly conveyed the impression that [he] considered Baghdadi courageous.\u201d Yeah, can\u2019t imagine why people would\u2019ve gotten that impression from this:\n\n\u201cThe assertion that Baghdadi died as a coward was contradicted by the fact that rather than be captured he blew himself up.\u201d\n\nMax just wants to set the record straight:\n\nAn earlier version included a sentence questioning whether Trump was right to call Baghdadi a coward. That was removed b/c it wrongly conveyed the impression that I considered Baghdadi courageous. As I wrote Sun: Baghdadi was \"a sick and depraved man.\" https://t.co/R77v7ef0GR \u2014 Max Boot (@MaxBoot) October 28, 2019\n\nLet the record show that Max Boot continues to be an idiot.\n\nPerfect.\n\nLOLOLOLOLOL \u2014 Dr. Kankokage (@kankokage) October 28, 2019\n\npic.twitter.com/XQwCPScSnD \u2014 Neva the #1 American elbow doctor of New Jersey (@pipandbaby) October 28, 2019\n\nLooks like you also deleted this tweet, which made it clear exactly what you were trying to convey. https://t.co/JoOPIkTjEG pic.twitter.com/h6CulwGLfO \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) October 28, 2019\n\nNo, we understood you quite well the first time. \u2014 Mark C, austere BBQ scholar \ud83e\udd53\ud83e\udd53 (@UntraceableMC) October 28, 2019\n\nIf anything, they\u2019ve both proven that they can\u2019t be killed with conventional weapons \u2014 The H2 (@TheH2) October 28, 2019\n\nEmbrace this ratio you coward pic.twitter.com/a2JarbkLO4 \u2014 ConservativeBlackMan \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@NevilleD35) October 28, 2019\n\nThe amount of rot in punditry is so obvious.
