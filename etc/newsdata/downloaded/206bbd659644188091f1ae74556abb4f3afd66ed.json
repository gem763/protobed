He also expects RB Salzburg to discover why, as Barcelona and many others can testify, Liverpool represent \u201cthe most uncomfortable opponent you can face\u201d.\n\nKlopp mentioned Barcelona without prompting as he savoured the prospect of Liverpool\u2019s first home game in the Champions League since that unforgettable semi-final second leg on 7 May. The soon-to-be European champions turned Anfield wild that night by making the seemingly impossible possible. Salzburg\u2019s visit may be tame in comparison but the arrival of the free-scoring Austrian champions promises to create another frenzied occasion.\n\nJesse Marsch\u2019s team have averaged over 4.5 goals per game this season \u2013 a remarkable 55 in 12 games \u2013 and possess one of the most promising young strikers in Europe in Erling Braut Haaland, who has missed their last two matches through illness. But they have not faced a rearguard containing the best defender in the world, as Klopp described Virgil van Dijk on Tuesday, nor an opponent with the intensity of Liverpool at Anfield. \u201cWith our home ground,\u201d the Liverpool manager said, \u201cwe can do a few things that not everyone else on the planet can do.\u201d\n\nOf Salzburg, who opened their Champions League campaign with a 6-2 defeat of Genk, Klopp said: \u201cThey remind me of what I did years ago at Mainz, a clear 4-4-2 and you make life pretty uncomfortable for each opponent. If any team thought: \u2018It\u2019s [only] Mainz,\u2019 we were there. But we don\u2019t think that. Not at all. We are not like this.\n\n\u201cWith the system they play it is possible to cause each team in the world problems. They played in pre-season against Madrid and lost but I am sure Madrid were surprised. They played Chelsea and Chelsea won but it was like: \u2018Wow.\u2019 They are really intense, it will be intense, and it will be wild in moments. I could talk for two hours on what they do well but what is really important is that they never played us. For me that is the most important message, and what they hopefully think about as well when they go to bed tonight is that it is Anfield and it is us.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp admits Liverpool could face trouble over ineligible player Read more\n\n\u201cWe respect each opponent. That is in our DNA. When you come here we respect you and we show that with our attitude and the effort we put in the game. We are the most uncomfortable opponent you can face if we are spot on. We don\u2019t want to play against their 4-4-2 with this pressing idea and thinking we can outplay them with a pass here and a pass there. It is about physicality as well. It is about the right level of aggressiveness. There will be challenges and we need to be there. We will defend them with all that we have. We want to win this football game.\u201d\n\nDefeat in Naples, on the night Haaland was scoring his fourth hat-trick of the season against Genk, has left Liverpool with the familiar pressure of having to maximise home advantage in the Champions League. Klopp, who is without Jo\u00ebl Matip after the defender suffered a slight knee injury at Sheffield United on Saturday, added: \u201cWhen you saw the group, before you started thinking about what Salzburg is exactly, you would have thought: \u2018Good group \u2013 Napoli, Liverpool \u2026 and the other two.\u2019 But you go into detail about an opponent and you realise it is impressive what they do.\n\n\u201cBut the 6-2 against Genk was not a 6-2. Four counterattacking goals, Genk not that bad for the first half an hour. Just like our 2-0 defeat against Napoli was not a 2-0. The group started two weeks ago and now there is the next game for all of us. Let\u2019s make it as positive as we can because it is the first game since Barcelona that we play at Anfield. It is like a reunion with the European crowd. Okay, we have played Premier League games but these European nights are based on the performances of all of us. I really hope we can create that atmosphere again and see what it is good for.\u201d\n\nLiverpool have two former Salzburg players in Sadio Man\u00e9 and the fit-again Naby Ke\u00efta. Man\u00e9 admits the reunion will be \u201ca special game for me\u201d but sentiment only runs so far. \u201cI love the city, I still love the club and I will be really happy to meet my ex-teammates,\u201d the Liverpool forward said. \u201cAt the same time, I would love to win against them.\u201d", "description": "Austrian champions arrive in dazzling scoring form but German is confident a \u2018European reunion\u2019 will buoy his Liverpool side", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bb7816508e0326be8869caab82274ea650d0889/0_26_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=29b643d874645e257c7ebeb68ff09a58"}
