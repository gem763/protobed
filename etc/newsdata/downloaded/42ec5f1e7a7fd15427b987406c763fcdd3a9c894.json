Since she wore a custom waist-cinching corset and knee-length shapewear beneath the form-fitting dress (which required two people to help her get into!), the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star knew it would be nearly impossible to remove any layer to enable her to use the bathroom throughout the night.\n\n\u201cIf I have to pee, it\u2019s a problem. Honestly, if it\u2019s an emergency, I think I pee my pants and then have my sister wipe my leg up,\u201d Kardashian West said. \u201cI\u2019m not even joking. She can wipe my leg up.\u201d\n\nUsing the toilet wasn\u2019t the only challenge Kardashian West faced with her most recent Met Gala dress. The intricate water droplet beading was also incredibly painful for her to wear throughout the night.\n\n\u201cNot only is this silicone [and] 500 hours of beading and making, but every little piece is itchy on the inside. It\u2019s pokey. So it pokes me,\u201d she explained.\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians/E! More\n\nOnce she slipped the dress on during the fitting, Kardashian West discussed how she planned on posing once she hit the red carpet.\n\n\u201cKanye [West] can come in and take some with me but I definitely want solo [shots],\u201d she said. \u201cThe first year he was holding my hand and I was wearing a floral glove and they just cropped me out.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians/E! More\n\nWhile she ended up with show-stopping photos of the final look on the night of the Met Gala, Kardashian West said her corset left her with serious indentation marks on her body.\n\nKarwai Tang/Getty Images More\n\n\u201cI have never felt pain like that in my life,\u201d Kardashian West, 38, told the WSJ Magazine for a digital cover story.\n\nShe added, \u201cI\u2019ll have to show you pictures of the aftermath when I took it off \u2014 the indentations on my back and my stomach.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on E!.", "description": "Kim Kardashian's Met Gala Dress Was So Tight, She Considered Peeing Her Pants 'If It's an Emergency'", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Frey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/33E9i9B_8Dpk6qDnpe_EcA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/5d2dd3177b1d834e408a7d3da9c04beb", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
