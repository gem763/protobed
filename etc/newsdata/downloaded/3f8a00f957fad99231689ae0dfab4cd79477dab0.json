Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at Queensbridge Park in Long Island City, New York, on Saturday alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and declared that Hillary Clinton \u201cbeat\u201d Trump in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe polls will show you that there are four or five Democrats \u2014 consistently it shows head to head \u2014 [who] can beat Trump,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut beating him isn\u2019t enough. Hillary beat him. That\u2019s not enough. We need not only to crush Trump at the polls, afterwards we need to fix this rotten, corrupt economic system that gave us Donald Trump and everything else we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\nDespite Moore\u2019s claims, Clinton did not \u201cbeat\u201d Trump in 2016, as Trump surpassed the 270 Electoral College threshold with 306 electoral votes (later reduced to 304 due to two faithless electors) compared to Clinton\u2019s 227. Trump won, in part, due to victories in key swing states \u2014 such as Florida \u2014 and his ability to flip Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan red.\n\nMoore also lamented the existence of the Electoral College, calling it \u2014 not Sanders \u2014 \u201ctoo old.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell here\u2019s what\u2019s too old. The Electoral College is too old. That\u2019s what\u2019s too old,\u201d the Fahrenheit 11/9 director said. \u201cA $7.25 minimum wage\u2013 that\u2019s too old. Women not being paid the same as men\u2013 that\u2019s too old.\u201d", "description": "Left-wing documentary filmmaker Michael Moore declared that Hillary Clinton \"beat\" President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/michaelmoorehillarybeat1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
