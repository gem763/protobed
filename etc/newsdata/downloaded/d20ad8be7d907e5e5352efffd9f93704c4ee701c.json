USA TODAY\n\nIn comments that surely won't rile up #NBATwitter, Michael Jordan said that Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry is \"not a Hall of Famer yet.\"\n\nWait, what? Let us explain:\n\nHis Airness was featured in a segment on the \"Today\" show that was posted on YouTube on Monday. In a wide-ranging interview with Craig Melvin, Jordan spoke about being a new grandfather, giving back, tequila and much more. At the close of the piece, Jordan was asked about comments he made several years ago where he said he would select Scottie Pippen, Magic Johnson, Hakeem Olajuwon and James Worthy to play with him in a pickup game.\n\nHe stands by those choices six years later, saying: \"I'm going in the trenches. I played against and with all these guys. I'm going with who I know. Every single night, their responsibility to go out there and represent greatness, every single night.\"\n\n\"So Steph Curry shouldn't be offended when he watches this?\" Melvin asked.\n\n\"I hope not. He's still a great player. Not a Hall of Famer yet, though,\" Jordan said with a smile, which was greeted by laughter by Melvin.\n\n\"He's not.\"\n\nMJ says Steph Curry isn\u2019t a Hall of Famer. pic.twitter.com/diQyNi75dk \u2014 TheWarriorsTalk (@TheWarriorsTalk) October 22, 2019\n\nYou can watch the full piece below, with the pickup-game segment and his comments on Curry beginning at the 3:40 mark.\n\nIt certainly seems like Jordan was joking with his Curry comments, given his delivery and Melvin's reaction. He could have also been referring to the fact that Curry is not literally a Hall of Famer yet (Jordan was inducted in 2009 and everyone on his hypothetical pickup team is in the Hall).\n\nCurry, of course, will 100% make the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame when his time comes. The 31-year-old is already a two-time MVP, a three-time champion and seems likely to hold every meaningful 3-point record in league history by the time he hangs 'em up (he's already third all-time in made threes).\n\nJordan, now 56, is regarded by many as the greatest basketball player of all time. A six-time champion and six-time Finals MVP, MJ is also currently the owner of the Charlotte Hornets. Both Jordan and Curry grew up in North Carolina, and Curry's father, Dell, played for the Hornets from 1988-1998.\n\nSo again, this all seems a joke on Jordan's part.
