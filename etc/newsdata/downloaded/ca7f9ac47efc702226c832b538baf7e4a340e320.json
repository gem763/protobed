The judge, Alistair MacDonald QC, also ruled that she could be taken to Italy for treatment.\n\nAt a press conference at the Gaslini on Wednesday, Tafida\u2019s mother, Shelina Begum, thanked the hospital for \u201cbelieving in my daughter\u2019s recovery\u201d and said the transfer by chartered plane was \u201cextremely smooth\u201d.\n\nBegum said: \u201cI visited Tafida this morning, she is stable, she was awake, fully awake, turning her head from side to side. I told her that mummy and daddy are here and the whole family are coming.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The parents of Tafida Raqeeb, Shelina Begum and Mohammed Raqeeb, in Genoa, Italy.

Begum claimed the doctors were wrong to say her daughter had no awareness and had been consistently wrong about her prognosis.\n\nBegum, an immigration lawyer, and her husband, Mohammed Raqeeb, wanted to take Tafida to Italy because hospitals there usually keep patients on life support until they are brain dead. They also expressed a hope that the Gaslini would perform a tracheotomy, enabling Tafida to be ventilated at home.\n\nBegum told the court that even if the judge ruled her daughter could not be withdrawn from life support, she wanted her to be treated in Italy as there had been a breakdown of trust with the Royal London.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the family had only raised just over \u00a350,000 of the \u00a3400,000 target to cover legal and treatment fees but Begum said at the press conference that the money \u201cshould not run out\u201d as \u201cfinancial sponsors\u201d would step in if donations were insufficient.\n\nIt emerged during the high court hearing that a Saudi prince had offered to help pay for Tafida\u2019s treatment and that her transfer to Italy was being funded by the conservative community platform CitizenGO, which intervened in other end-of-life cases involving children, including those of Charlie Gard, Alfie Evans and Isaiah Haastrup.\n\nBegum declined to say how much the Gaslini was charging, but on the crowdfunding page she estimated the cost of continuing life-sustaining treatment at \u00a3280,000.\n\nShe said: \u201cMy hope for Tafida would be to see her improve every day, something that she has been doing in the last eight months.\u201d", "description": "Tafida Raqeeb\u2019s mother says it is wise for her to become citizen after transfer to Genoa hospital", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f2ab7922958f902aad39e48e302f1409350d472/0_243_2524_1515/master/2524.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4cb0d201420ea63e7e71f33da70d023f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
