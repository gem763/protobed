But, whatever happens, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union on 31 October with or without an agreement. That is why the risk of a no deal is palpable.\"\n\nHe said the European Commission was prepared to work \"day in day out, morning until night\" to find solutions but warned he was \"not sure that we will get there.\"", "description": "Johnson's negotiators have so far only presented the EU with a draft of the withdrawal agreement with the backstop scrubbed out.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d81f9142e22af6742628fd8-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
