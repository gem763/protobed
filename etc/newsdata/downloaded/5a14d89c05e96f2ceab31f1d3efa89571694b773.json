It sounds good in theory, but there is a cost involved.\n\nTo pay it, individuals like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recommend progressive tax rates of up to 54% and 70%, respectively. This is justified, proponents say, by the increasing income inequality in the United States. The argument tends to be that the rich are obtaining an ever-increasing slice of the pie and, therefore, the poor are consequentially getting poorer.\n\nThere are numerous problems with these tax plans. First, they do not offer a solution for our growing deficit, let alone the proposed entitlements. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tax plan would raise only an additional $72 billion each year, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Noah Smith. As Smith notes, \u201cWealthy people have eye-popping incomes, but there really aren\u2019t that many of them.\u201d When you consider that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal could cost anywhere between $51.1 trillion and $92.9 trillion over a nine-year period, it\u2019s clear our deficit would be going in the wrong direction. And indeed, it already is.\n\nOur national debt is now more than $22 trillion. It is projected to balloon to $28.7 trillion by 2029. Just 20 years ago, it was under $6 trillion. Continuing to pile entitlements upon entitlements will not solve our problem, it will worsen it.\n\nI wrote recently about Sweden and its Nordic neighbors, and the generous government entitlement programs they offer. So how do these countries pay for these programs? Simple\u2026everyone pays high taxes. As set forth in a 2015 article by the Tax Foundation, these countries raise a significantly higher percentage of their GDP than the United States, even though their marginal tax rate is close to (or in some cases lower than) that of the United States. Again, this is because their tax rates are fairly flat. The Tax Foundation provides this example:\n\n\"Sweden\u2019s top marginal tax rate of 56.9 percent applies to all income over 1.5 times the average income in Sweden. Norway\u2019s top marginal tax rate of 39 percent applies to all income over 1.6 times the average Norwegian income.\n\n\"Compare this to The United States. The top marginal tax rate of 46.8 percent (state average and federal combined rates) kicks in at 8.5 times the average U.S. income (around $400,000). Comparatively, few taxpayers in the United States face the top marginal rate.\"\n\nYou can probably imagine why Bernie Sanders and AOC would shy away from telling the electorate that everyone would need to pay higher taxes in order to fund their ambitious entitlements. After all, a \u201cfree\u201d lunch doesn\u2019t sound so good if you have to pay for it.\n\nAside from the mathematical difficulties, there is a philosophical issue to consider. Do those with the most wealth have an obligation to fund entitlements for all and help \u201credistribute\u201d that wealth? Politicians like Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez answer in the affirmative, arguing that a small percentage of individuals should pay a significantly greater share of taxes. Bernie Sanders has decried the fact that \u201cthe top 1 percent\u201d possess 40 percent of the nation\u2019s total wealth, and suggests that they therefore owe a duty to \u201cpay their fair share.\u201d\n\nWhat Bernie often fails to acknowledge, as noted by Lee Edwards, is that the top 1 percent already pay nearly 40 percent of the individual income taxes.\n\nWe also should consider a more fundamental issue: should we focus on \u201credistributing\u201d the existing wealth of this nation \u2013 that is, re-slice the pie we have \u2013 or should we focus on baking a bigger pie? Data demonstrates that our economy is dynamic, not static. In other words, free markets allow the entire pie to grow.\n\nHow else can we explain the reality, noted by Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, that between 2000 and 2012, \u201cthe rate of absolute poverty in the world fell by 50 percent.\u201d Kay Cole James, the president of the Heritage Foundation, adds that \u201cover the last 25 years, the spread of policies that promote economic freedom has cut the global poverty rate by two thirds.\u201d Peterson adds, \u201cthe poor in the world are getting rich at a rate that is absolutely unparalleled in all of human history.\u201d Accordingly, what it means to be poor in 2019 is very different than what it meant to be poor in 1919.\n\nIn other words, the rich are getting richer\u2026but so is everyone else.\n\nBut the outcomes are unfair, some say. It\u2019s true that our economic system allows for unequal outcome. But our founders did not endorse equal outcomes in this life, only equal opportunity. And while some have levied legitimate criticisms in regard to America\u2019s historical fulfillment of its promise of equal opportunity, its elimination is not the solution. Rather, the continued promotion of equal opportunity must be our goal, for that is, as Winston Churchill said, \u201cthe strong and willing horse\u201d that pulls America along.", "description": "Socialism will cure the ills of society, or so the .09/16/2019 1:33:23AM EST.", "authors": ["James", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/207/2b15e07f-ab31-4f66-af06-6f9fbc4920ed.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
