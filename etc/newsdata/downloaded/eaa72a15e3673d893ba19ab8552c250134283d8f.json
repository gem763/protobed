It was the 2020 presidential candidate\u2019s first big campaign event since he suffered a heart attack earlier this month.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nMoore told the crowd that age and health are not factors for Sanders (I-VT). Instead, the Sicko director blamed political pundits and the media for making the 78-year-old politician\u2019s age an issue by recycling tired \u201ctropes.\u201d\n\n[Watch the video below]\n\n\u201cThey are doing everything they can to throw everything they can come up with, to get people to think differently about Bernie,\u201d Moore told the massive crowd. \u201cSo what do they say? Bernie\u2019s too old.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Well, here\u2019s what\u2019s too old,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe electoral college is too old. That\u2019s what\u2019s too old. A $7.25 minimum wage, that\u2019s too old. Women not being paid the same as men, that\u2019s too old. Thousands and thousands of dollars of student debt. What is that? Too old.\u201d\n\nMoore went on to say Sanders\u2019 age and experience are benefits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a gift that we have a 78-year-old American running for president of the United States,\u201d the left-leaning director stated. \u201cBernie has seen the things many of us have never seen \u2014 a pay raise! How about that?\u201d\n\nAfter the crowd erupted in laughter, Moore added, \u201cA 78-year-old knows what a pension is. Remember that? Look it up. A 78-year-old knows what it looks like to defeat fascism and white supremacy.\u201d\n\nMoore then told attendees it\u2019s time to dump President Trump.\n\n\u201cWe need to not only crush Trump at the polls, afterwards, we aim to fix this rotten, corrupt, economic system that gave us Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nThe director also endorsed Sanders in the race for the White House in 2016.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
