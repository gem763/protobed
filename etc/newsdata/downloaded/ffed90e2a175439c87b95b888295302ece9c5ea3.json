He had watched Lord Keen seemingly crash and burn in the supreme court the previous day as he had fumbled and mumbled against the Scottish ruling that the government had acted unlawfully in proroguing parliament. He was anxious not to embarrass him further.\n\nSo Eadie, representing the government, deliberately chose to make a virtue of his own mediocrity as he appeared to spend the morning doing everything other than explain why the English courts had been right to find the prorogation lawful. Quite how the government chooses its advocates is something of a mystery. Would a lawyer chasing PPI claims have made a better fist of it?\n\nNot that Eadie wasn\u2019t a huge improvement on Keen. He spoke slowly, each sentence a dull monotone fading into silence. Much like a broken clockwork toy. Um, everything was basically in order, er, because it was. The judges should trust the government. Even when it was lying through its teeth. Because if we couldn\u2019t trust the government then ... Then something.\n\nAs they had with Keen, the Lords Reed and Carnwath tried to come to Eadie\u2019s rescue with some helpful interventions, but most of the other judges were far more hostile in their questioning than they had been on the first day. They weren\u2019t in the mood to be pushed around by the government or its flunkeys. They were sentient beings in their own right and they would rule on what they liked. Something that came as a bit of a shock to Eadie, who had just argued it wasn\u2019t for the court to decide what was relevant and rational. Presumably he imagines most legal decisions are made with the help of a Ouija board.\n\nEadie struggled on, each argument weaker than the last. If parliament hadn\u2019t wanted to be prorogued, why wasn\u2019t it doing something to stop being prorogued? He still hadn\u2019t quite grasped that parliament can\u2019t do anything when it is prorogued. Fairly basic stuff, you\u2019d have thought. The time-sensitive legislation could be dealt with when parliament returned. Apart from the bits that were time sensitive. He didn\u2019t even seem entirely sure of the difference between recess and prorogation. This isn\u2019t a supreme court episode that Eadie will want to watch on iPlayer.\n\nWith half an hour to go, Eadie started looking at the clock, willing the hands to move round to 1pm so that his ordeal would end. Keen stood up to pass round some bundles \u2013 he might as well make one useful contribution to proceedings \u2013 in the hope Eadie might find some inspiration somewhere. He couldn\u2019t.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t explain why the Incredible Sulk had not signed a witness statement giving the reasons for the prorogation. In fact, he didn\u2019t even bother to pretend that the pretext for suspending parliament had been the Queen\u2019s speech. No one believed a word Boris Johnson said. Not even him. Especially him. The longer he spoke the more it seemed everything in the government\u2019s argument was probably false. It was all he could do to prevent himself making a full confession.\n\nThe afternoon session was something else. Making the case for the Scottish ruling to be upheld, Aidan O\u2019Neill had clearly decided Lord Pannick had already won the case on the facts \u2013 though to give them their due, Keen and Eadie appeared to have already lost it on the facts \u2013 and that enough judges had already made up their minds on the justiciability of the proceedings, so he was free to let rip with his own unique brand of oratory. This was the courtroom as proper primetime TV drama.\n\nHe began by going full-on Braveheart for 30 minutes, making an impassioned plea for the importance of all things Scottish, daring the judges to insult them. Robbie Burns, John Buchan, Walter Scott, Macbeth. That carpet with a thistle on it. They all got a mention. All that was missing was the Proclaimers. Then they were part-timers only walking 500 miles.\n\nHaving captured his audience \u2013 some against their will: Eadie looked as if he wanted to throw up \u2013 O\u2019Neill then took aim at the government. You couldn\u2019t trust the Incredible Sulk further than you could throw him. Boris lied and he lied and he lied. He couldn\u2019t help himself. That very day he had even denied there were TV cameras there as he was filmed visiting a hospital. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely no press,\u201d the liar had lied.\n\nLord Reed appeared vaguely upset that anyone might question the prime minister\u2019s probity, but O\u2019Neill just went for him. \u201cDon\u2019t be sceptical, be upset\u201d, he said. Reed wisely kept quiet. No one else dared interrupt him. Indeed, it rather felt as if most of the judges were taking some kind of masochistic pleasure in being talked at in this way. It made a difference from their usual dusty hearings. And in their heart of hearts, they probably suspected O\u2019Neill was on the side of the angels.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just some academic legal exercise, O\u2019Neill continued. This was a prorogation with a purpose to hijack democracy. And the judges and the courts shouldn\u2019t take it lying down. Though a good lie down was just what they needed come the close. It had been an exhausting two hours for everyone. A session that would resonate on both sides of the border.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s counsel failed to explain why the Incredible Sulk had refused to explain his reasons", "authors": ["John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2577696c7a23b385dd2b3daededd491825e70972/0_72_2032_1219/master/2032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fdb4263f5235a80e01a1b44279769595", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
