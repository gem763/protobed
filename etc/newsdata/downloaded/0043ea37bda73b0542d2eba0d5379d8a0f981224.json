(Screenshot: Apple)\n\nApple\u2019s premium game subscription, Apple Arcade, hits the App Store on Friday, September 20. If you can\u2019t bear to wait, though, I have good news. Apple Arcade hit the iOS 13 beta version App Store on Tuesday, so you can sign up for the service now and start playing a couple days early if you\u2019re so inclined.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t signed up for the iOS 13 Beta, go to the Apple Beta Software Program website on your iPhone, sign in with your Apple ID, and follow the instructions. (Don\u2019t worry, we have a slightly more in-depth walkthrough if the process seems daunting.)\n\nOnce you\u2019ve installed the beta, simply go to the App Store. There\u2019s a new tab on the guide bar at the bottom of the screen for Arcade. (Look for the joystick logo.) From there, all you have to do is sign up. Note that, even in the beta, signing up for a subscription requires you to have an active credit card attached to your App Store account. From there, peruse the games and download whatever looks good.\n\nScreenshot: Mike Epstein\n\nApple has advertised that Arcade will offer users \u201cover 100 games,\u201d but it seems that\u2019s a goal Apple plans to work towards. According to MacRumors, the current library includes 53 games, with more coming to the service every week. There are some interesting looking games from exciting developers on the list, though, so don\u2019t let the number dissuade you.\n\nApple Arcade costs $7.99 per month, following a one-month trial period. The service will be available on iOS Friday, iPadOS on October 1, and MacOS Catalina when it launches later in October. If you can't access the beta, there isn't long to go for the full release! Once it\u2019s up and running all of the games will be playable across all compatible Apple Devices.", "description": "Apple\u2019s premium game subscription, Apple Arcade, hits the App Store on Friday, September 20.
