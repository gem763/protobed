Downing Street said that \u201cif this represents a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever.\u201d How people and goods will move across the Irish border is the main sticking point to a deal.\n\nThe German government confirmed that Merkel and Johnson had spoken but declined to comment on the substance of \u201cconfidential conversations.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said \u201cthe EU position has not changed. We want a deal. We are working for a deal with the U.K.\u201d\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk tweeted testily that \u201cwhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people,\u201d he said, addressing Johnson. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\u201d \u2014 a Latin phrase meaning \u201cwhere are you going?\u201d\n\nDespite the grim mood music, British officials insisted they still hope to strike a deal before Britain\u2019s scheduled Oct. 31 departure date \u2014 although Johnson has also said the U.K. will leave even if one is not struck.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved \u2014 it is now time for the EU to move too,\u201d said Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit preparations. \u201cIf it does, then there is still every chance we can leave with a new deal.\u201d\n\nDowning Street said Johnson spoke by phone to Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Tuesday afternoon, and \u201cboth sides strongly reiterated their desire to reach a Brexit deal.\u201d It said the two leaders hoped to meet in person later in the week.\n\nEU leaders have demanded more \u201crealism\u201d from Britain in response to a Brexit plan proposed by Johnson. The bloc says the proposals \u2014 which would require customs checks on some goods moving between Northern Ireland and Ireland \u2014 don\u2019t fulfill the U.K.\u2019s commitment to a frictionless Irish border.\n\nAn open border is key to both the regional economy and the peace agreement that ended 30 years of conflict between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is part of the U.K. but shares an island \u2014 and a land border \u2014 with the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about trade, it\u2019s about so much more than that, and anybody who understands Ireland and the politics of this island understands that,\u201d said Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said the EU will assess by Friday whether a deal is possible.\n\nJohnson\u2019s opponents in Britain accused the government of deliberately undermining the Brexit talks.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit,\u201d said Keir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the main opposition Labour Party.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain published more details of its plans for leaving without a divorce deal. The government says those plans will minimize any resulting economic shock.\n\nEconomists and business groups warn that no amount of preparation can eliminate the pain of new barriers with the EU, which accounts for almost half of U.K. trade.\n\nThe government\u2019s \u201cno-deal readiness report\u201d shows significant British preparation but also acknowledges its limits. Britain says it will try to keep goods flowing by not immediately imposing border checks on imports from the EU. But the government acknowledges there will be new tariffs on 60% of British exports to the EU, including levies of more than 50% on beef and lamb.\n\nMany in the EU \u2014 and in Britain \u2014 are skeptical that Britain will leave the bloc on Oct. 31 because the U.K. Parliament has passed a law compelling the government to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit if no deal is agreed upon by Oct. 19.\n\nJohnson says he will obey the law but will not ask for a delay. It\u2019s not clear how those two statements can be reconciled \u2014 but it\u2019s clear Johnson wants to pin the blame for any delay on Parliament and the EU, so that he can campaign as a champion of Brexit in an election that\u2019s likely to be called soon.\n\nBoth the government and the opposition see a national vote as the only way to break Britain\u2019s Brexit deadlock, though they disagree on the timing.\n\nParliament is set to be suspended Tuesday evening so that a new session can begin next week with a major policy speech from Johnson\u2019s Conservative government.\n\nAn earlier attempt by the government to shut down Parliament for five weeks was ruled illegal by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court because it had the effect of preventing legislators from scrutinizing the government\u2019s Brexit plans. This week\u2019s shorter suspension is more routine.
