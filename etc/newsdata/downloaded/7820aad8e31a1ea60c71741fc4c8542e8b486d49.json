They are very active and pose a security risk to the U.S. and our allies,\" read a statement provided to Business Insider by the FBI on behalf of Alan E. Kohler Jr., a special agent in charge of the FBI Washington Field Office's Counterintelligence Division.\n\n\"Russia has long been a counterintelligence threat to the U.S. and election interference is certainly an important concern, but it's not the only one,\" the statement reads. \"The FBI uses a variety of means to gather information, including the use of sources. The FBI will use all legal means available to locate individuals with information that can help protect the United States from threats to our national security.\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nOnce clicked, these ads direct to the website of the FBI's Washington Field Office Counterintelligence Program.\n\n\"The mission of the counterintelligence program at the FBI's Washington Field Office is to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States through the detection, identification, and neutralization of hostile foreign intelligence activities,\" the website reads.\n\n\"The FBI obtains the best intelligence to combat this threat through information provided by the public.
