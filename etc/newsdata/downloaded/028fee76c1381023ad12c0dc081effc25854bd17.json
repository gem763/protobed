Why, moderator and CRS executive director RJ Curtis asked, do many modern country singers frequently refuse to discuss politics today?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter hailing Johnny Cash as one of country\u2019s few truly outspoken artists, Gill added, \u201cI stuck up for the Dixie Chicks 20 years ago when they buried them.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cthey,\u201d he clearly meant the industry response after Maines, during a March 2003 concert in London, famously said, \u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re on the good side with y\u2019all. We do not want this war, this violence, and we\u2019re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.\u201d\n\nMaines\u2019s quote went viral, and there was a furious response from the country music world. Even though the trio (also made up of Emily Robison and Martie Maguire) was one of the most successful acts in the genre\u2019s history, country radio stopped playing their songs; fans destroyed their CDs; they got death threats.\n\nAD\n\nAs for Gill, he was indeed one of the few high-profile figures who came to their defense.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s political leaders that said a lot worse things about George Bush than Natalie did. Nobody rips them for it, you know?\u201d Gill said in April 2003 at the CMT Flameworthy Awards in Nashville, according to TheBoot.com. \u201cI kind of feel like she\u2019s been bashed enough.\u201d\n\nThe next week, Gill clarified to the Tennessean that he held \u201cthe completely opposite view of Natalie Maines\u201d because \u201cthe troops and the president don\u2019t have a bigger supporter than me.\u201d Still, he believed in freedom of speech. A month later at the Academy of Country Music Awards, the audience booed when the Dixie Chicks were mentioned. While onstage presenting the entertainer of the year prize, Gill admonished the crowd.\n\n\u201dStop it, stop it,\u201d he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. \"You know who gets blessed when you forgive: you.\u201d\n\nGill said that Natalie\u2019s father, steel guitar player Lloyd Maines, saw him a few years ago and told him, \"I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you this for many, many years, but you and Roseanne [Cash] were the only two people that stuck up for my kid. And as a father, I just wanted to thank you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n(In 2003, Cash told Salon she was concerned about Maines: \u201cWhat can we do to help this poor girl? I could not believe when I was in Nashville last week what they are doing to her: tractors running over the records, insisting that she go on TV to recant.\u201d)\n\nGill is still struck by how the situation unfolded. \u201cI found it pretty astounding that they kind of buried them for just making a probably not-so-polite comment,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut all I said was, \u2018Man, I hear people say a lot worse things about him every day up on Capitol Hill and nobody gets barbecued for that. Why are you going to take their career away from them?\u2019 \u201d\n\nIncidentally, getting \u201cDixie Chicked\u201d in Nashville is still a real fear, and it\u2019s why some artists fear speaking out about anything controversial. Gill himself doesn\u2019t hold back: His new album, \u201cOkie,\u201d (which he calls \u201cpretty edgy\u201d) covers topics from teen pregnancy to sexual abuse.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to make a statement and say \u2018Believe what I believe,\u2019 \u201d Gill said. \u201cI just think if you can have a fair and decent and graceful conversation about any subject, nobody has to get completely unwound to the point of all that division.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The singer brought up the controversy during a discussion about the Ken Burns \u201cCountry Music\u201d documentary.", "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2QjWjf8sssItuoUbLSTaCyp20hc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JSYAEHHLUFB6TFX2FYZXUW5WRY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
