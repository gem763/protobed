He had managed last week to work out an agreement on the terms of Brexit with E.U. leaders.\n\nJohnson was forced, as a result of the Tuesday vote, to ask E.U. leaders to delay the departure deadline until January 31, 2020. However, in the Thursday interview the Prime Minister indicated he will call a general election before that date.\n\n\u201cIf Parliament genuinely wants more time to study this excellent deal, they can have it \u2014 but they have to agree to a general election on Dec. 12,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nUnder a 2011 law, Johnson must obtain the support of two-thirds of Parliament in order to call elections, meaning he would need the agreement of the opposition Labour Party.\n\n\u201cI have written to [Labour head] Jeremy Corbyn: this Parliament must get Brexit done now or a NEW Parliament must get Brexit done so the country can move on,\u201d Johnson posted on Twitter, including an attachment of his letter to Corbyn.\n\nJohnson has previously stated he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit.\n\nNo comment was immediately available from Corbyn or the Labour party, although Labour had posted on its Twitter account urging citizens to register to vote.\n\n\u201cThere could be a General Election around the corner and your voice needs to be heard,\u201d the post read. \u201cMake sure you have a say in your future and register to vote today.\u201d", "description": "Johnson will call for a general election on December 12 after his latest push to exit the EU was stymied by Parliament.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
