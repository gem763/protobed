But it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.'\n\nTom asks her: 'And the answer is, would it be fair to say, not really OK, as in it's really been a struggle?' Meghan, visibly upset, then replies: 'Yes.'\n\nThe hashtag was trending in less than an hour after British author Greg Hogben urged people to share their support\n\nThe couple will be taking six weeks off from their royal duties over the Christmas period.\n\nA Royal source told The Sunday Times: 'The Duke and Duchess have a full schedule of engagements and commitments until mid-November, after which they will be taking some much-needed family time.'\n\nThe couple are expected to spend their first Christmas with their son Archie, who was born in May, with the Queen and other members of the Royal Family at Sandringham in Norfolk.\n\nIt is understood they will fly to Los Angeles next month to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland.\n\nHarry & Meghan: An African Journey is due for broadcast tonight at 9pm on ITV.", "description": "In the hour-long documentary with Tom Bradby, Prince Harry voices his desire to leave the UK and considers living in Africa, saying Cape Town would be an 'amazing place' to live.", "authors": ["Isabella Nikolic For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/13/19955186-0-image-a-11_1571573406604.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
