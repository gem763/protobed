My name is James South. I am a proud WWII veteran! I will be turning 100 on October 7th, 2019. I would like to receive 100 birthday cards,\u201d the sign read.\n\nOn Monday, Breitbart News reported that South had received more than 60,000 cards from people as far away as Australia and India.\n\nHowever, reports said that as of Friday, that number has climbed to over 100,000.\n\n\u201cTo go to a store in town and pick out a card and send it to me, that\u2019s almost more than I can handle I\u2019ll tell ya,\u201d the veteran said. \u201cIt touches my heart.\u201d\n\nSouth\u2019s daughter-in-law, Debbie, said the family has been emotional as they read each of the heartfelt birthday wishes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just crying everyday because we\u2019re just reading all these beautiful cards,\u201d she commented.\n\nOn Thursday, Alex Rozier, a reporter with WFAA, tweeted photos of South will all the birthday greetings he received.\n\nIn late September I did a story on World War II Vet James South. For his 100th birthday he wanted 100 cards. It\u2019s his birthday this week\u2026.so I followed up. I was greeted by James and 100,000 cards. If you need a reminder of the good in this world\u2026.this is it. pic.twitter.com/4dUMWx0zBx \u2014 Alex Rozier (@RozierReports) October 10, 2019\n\nSouth\u2019s son, Jim, noted that many of the cards have come from places such as Great Britain and China. He said schools hoping to teach their students about World War II also sent cards.\n\nHe even received a special birthday greeting from President Trump.\n\n\u201cOur nation owes your generation, the greatest generation, a tremendous debt of gratitude,\u201d the letter from the president read.\n\nSouth was born into a family of Texas sharecroppers and joined the United States Army in 1940. He was deployed to Normandy, France, only a week after the D-Day invasion took place.\n\nHis son said it means a lot to their family that people would take time out of their day to wish his father a happy birthday, even from thousands of miles away.\n\n\u201cThe people that have gone to the store for cards, and the people who have taken the time to pen out their thoughts and their feelings, it\u2019s just been an overwhelming and an amazing response,\u201d he said.\n\nSouth told reporters that he is grateful for having lived such a good life for so many years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just thanking God for watching over me and keeping me healthy. There\u2019s no telling where I\u2019ll go from here,\u201d the veteran concluded.", "description": "The birthday surprises have not stopped pouring in for a World War II veteran in Watauga, Texas, who turned 100 years old on Monday.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/James-South-WWII-veteran-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
