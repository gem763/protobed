(AP) - A new master plan for a South Carolina city focuses on growth and strengthening the city\u2019s downtown as the \u201ceconomic and cultural heart\u201d of the community.\n\nThe plan is for Travelers Rest. Mayor Brandy Amidon said it will serve as a guide for growth and development and \u201chelp the city be more intentional about what we want to come,\u201d The Greenville News reported.\n\nThe City Council approved the 36-page document during its September meeting. City Administrator Eric Vinson has said the plan was initiated this past spring as an effort to take a closer look at the city\u2019s downtown core and how residents want that area to grow.\n\nSome of the projects in plan are already under way, including beautification and landscaping along edges of the city and plans to market the city for the first time. Other initiatives will be done as funding becomes available, Amidon said.\n\nA new city website - www.TravelersRestSC.com -is among the projects completed. It will serve as a focal point to the city\u2019s communications efforts, said a news release announcing the launch of the site.\n\nThe projects in the master plan are styled as action plans under the headers of business vitality, promotion and image building, and design.\n\nUnderneath the design element, the city addresses a need to develop a parking strategy, a public art master plan, and the re-imagining of Gateway Park as Travelers Rest\u2019s Falls Park.\n\nThe latter recommends studying the feasibility of developing a central lake in Gateway as a green infrastructure feature for park stormwater management and downtown redevelopment.\n\nAdam Kelley, owner of Leopard Forest Coffee, said he hopes the plan will focus on pedestrians by improving intersections and driving more traffic away from the Swamp Rabbit Trail, which runs alongside Main Street.\n\nA main draw to the city\u2019s Main Street is the trail, which helps give the downtown a unique environment, Vinson said.\n\nResidents deemed the trail as one of the city\u2019s top assets during a survey for the master plan, Amidon said. It\u2019s currently the asset the city is working hardest on, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very intentional about making sure that everything is connected to the trail, that it\u2019s treated as a linear park and that we put money to it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe city\u2019s main concern though is growth.\n\nTravelers Rest is targeted for more growth partly because it is listed by the federal government as an opportunity zone for investment. The downtown master plan will give city leaders the ability to tell potential developers that whatever it brings into the city will need to be within in the plan.\n\nMore than 2,000 people responded to an online survey soliciting input about the master plan.\n\nThey shared their thoughts on a variety of issues, including the city\u2019s most important assets and attributes, the biggest challenges facing the city and, if they could, what changes they would make to positively affect the future of Travelers Rest over the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nWhat stood out for Amidon was \u201cpeople care and they want to be involved in what happens in TR.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat (2,200) people took the time to fill out a survey and say what they want and what they think is kind of powerful,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Greenville News, http://www.greenvillenews.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new master plan for a South Carolina city focuses on growth and strengthening the city's downtown as the \"economic and cultural heart\" of the community.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
