He said that Facebook\u2019s lack of presence in China meant it was able to make decisions more freely and that people having a voice was crucial to the success of democracy.\n\nIronically, the live stream of Zuckerberg\u2019s address was cut off before students at the university, members of the press or anyone else had a chance to actually question him about his views.\n\nFacebook and its founder have been under scrutiny for their approach to moderation \u2013 Mr Zuckerberg was earlier this week accused of trying to appease the US government to avoid potential future sanctions by holding informal meetings with supporters of President Donald Trump and right-wing media and political figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Mark was adamant that his products are being used for good.\n\n\u2018While our services like WhatsApp are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy practices, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these same protests are censored, even here in the US,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Is that the internet we want?\u2019 he asked rhetorically.\n\nMark Zuckerberg was speaking at Georgetown University (Getty Images North America)\n\nIn his address, Mr Zuckerberg said that among the biggest threats to free speech online was the use of laws in countries such as China to \u2018undermine free expression and people\u2019s human rights\u2019.\n\n\u2018These local laws are especially troubling when they shut down free speech in places where there isn\u2019t democracy or freedom of the press,\u2019 he said. \u2018But it\u2019s even worse when countries try to impose their speech restrictions on the rest of the world. This raises the larger question about the future of our global internet.\n\n\u2018China is building its own internet, focused on very different values, and it is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries.\n\n\u2018Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside of China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. But there is no guarantee that these values will win out. A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top 10 are Chinese.\u2019\n\nMr Zuckerberg also argued that allowing free speech on social media was crucial for social progress and democracy around the world, that discourse and debate were vital and that everyone should \u2018confront ideas that challenge us\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the issue of where to draw the line when it comes to moderating content, he said that while freedom of expression has never been absolute, most people agree with the principle that no one should say something that puts others in danger.\n\nChinese social media is taking over from American social media, Zuckerberg reckons (iStock Editorial)\n\nHe added that the focus when considering removing content should be on the authenticity of the speaker rather than judging the content itself and that platforms should target fake accounts rather than trying to moderate discourse.\n\nHe argued that social media users should still be able to say controversial things but have to stand behind those ideas by showing their true identity. He said he was concerned about the erosion of truth, but that he did not believe anyone wanted to live in a world where users can only post \u201cwhat a tech company judges to be 100% true\u2019.\n\nMr Zuckerberg also reiterated his stance that Facebook supports the introduction of more regulation of the tech sector. He said the company and wider society would benefit from more \u2018democratic processes and new institutions\u2019.\n\n\u2018The future depends on all of us, and whether you like Facebook or not, I think we need to recognise what is at stake and come together to stand for voice and free expression at this critical moment,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I believe in giving people a voice because at the end of the day, I believe in people, and as long as enough of us keep fighting for this, I believe that more people\u2019s voices will eventually help us work through these issues together and write a new chapter in our history \u2013 where from all our individual voices and perspectives, we can bring the world closer together.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can watch Zuckerberg\u2019s speech below:", "description": "The Facebook boss has strong words for TikTok", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90337928_1571383976.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
