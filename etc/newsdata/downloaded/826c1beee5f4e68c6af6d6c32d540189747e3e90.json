Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nAfter two mass shootings in Texas this month left 28 victims dead and 46 injured, state lawmakers responded \u2014 the day after the rampage in Midland and Odessa \u2014 by passing multiple laws loosening firearm restrictions, making it easier for owners to carry guns in churches, schools, and after disasters are declared. Despite a brief flirtation with stricter background checks following the shooting in El Paso, President Trump said after the shooting this weekend that he doesn\u2019t consider an expanded check process to be a viable solution to curbing gun violence \u2014 despite research that suggests such laws bring about a 40 percent decline in gun homicides and a 15 percent reduction in suicides.\n\nOn Monday, Bloomberg reported of another failure on the national stage to treat America\u2019s epidemic of gun violence with an acute gun-control solution.\n\nA little over a month since the administration announced the return of federal executions, Vice-President Mike Pence is now reportedly working with Attorney General William Barr and other Justice Department officials to draft legislation that rushes the execution of convicted mass murderers as a deterrent to future mass shooters. Though the idea was first announced earlier this summer and the details are few, former Vice-President Joe Biden described the proposal aptly on Monday on the campaign trail in Iowa: \u201cWhat you do when you can\u2019t get something done that\u2019s rational \u2014 you increase the penalty for the irrational.\u201d\n\nBut irrationality is the norm in the Trump administration, from the trade war with China that dampens the economy, to the apparent blaming of Puerto Rico for the government\u2019s underwhelming hurricane response on the island. Letting the Second Amendment run rampant over all other American liberties, despite the deaths of 346 Americans in mass shootings in 2019, forms to the logic of the administration \u2014 even if it didn\u2019t already fit with the Republican Party\u2019s staunch order not to enact gun reform. As New York\u2019s Eric Levitz put it after the August shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, Trump\u2019s non-reform efforts do not approach the problem in a linear fashion:\n\nThe president demanded unspecified measures to eliminate \u201cgruesome and grizzly video games.\u201d He called for reforming \u201cour mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment but, when necessary, involuntary confinement.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Trump proposed restricting freedom of expression, locking up anyone who strikes law enforcement as egregiously mentally ill for pre-crimes, and curtailing the due process rights Americans can assert before their government executes them.\n\nThe reported plan to expedite the execution process for mass shooters rather than enact gun reform is made more irrational by the fact that there is no evidence that the death penalty serves as a deterrent for potential capital offenders. There appears to be no deterrent effect on capital crimes between states with and without the death penalty. One study from 2009 found that 88 percent of criminologists did not consider the threat of execution as a deterrent, a level of consensus that matched the scientific consensus on human involvement in global warming. \u201cIt\u2019s the certainty of apprehension that\u2019s been demonstrated consistently to be an effective deterrent,\u201d Carnegie Mellon criminologist Daniel Nagin told the Washington Post. \u201cNot the severity of the ensuing consequences.\u201d", "description": "Mike Pence is reportedly working with AG William Barr and Justice Department officials to draft legislation that rushes the execution of mass murderers to deter future mass shooters, despite there being no evidence that such deterrence works.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/02/william_barr.w1200.h630.jpg"}
