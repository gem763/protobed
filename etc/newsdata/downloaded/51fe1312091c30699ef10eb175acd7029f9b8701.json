And the Chinese government has asked the Trump administration to extradite him.\n\nBannon declined to comment.\n\nThe first contract, signed between Bannon and Guo Media, gives Bannon $1 million for one year of consulting services beginning in August 2018.\n\nBannon is specifically contracted to introduce Guo Media to \u201cmedia personalities,\u201d and advise the company on \u201cindustry standards.\u201d\n\nBannon has made China one of his top issues since leaving the White House in the summer of 2017.\n\nThe second contract, which was set to begin in August 2019 and is unsigned, offered Bannon $1 million for consulting and set more specific expectations.\n\nIn addition to the services requested in the first contract, the second would have required Bannon to serve as senior editor for G News \u2014 Guo Media\u2019s news arm \u2014 and help to elevate G News as a credible source of news on China.\n\nGuo Media is owned by Saraca Media Group, a company incorporated in Delaware, according to the contracts. Per a March 2019 tax filing, the president and director of Saraca was an individual named Han Chunguang.\n\n\u201c[I]t is my understanding that given Mr. Bannon's cross-border financial expertise at Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale, Saraca previously retained him for strategic advisory work regarding media investments, M&A, joint ventures, and cryptocurrencies,\u201d Daniel Podhaskie, a spokesperson for Guo, tells Axios in an email statement.\n\n\u201cMr. Bannon's work in these areas was complete and he is currently not retained. Mr. Guo had no involvement in him being retained or his work for Saraca.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Guo has no financial interest in Saraca Media Group or its media platform known as \u2018Guo Media.\u2019 Mr. Guo is merely the face of Guo Media and was requested by Saraca to act in this capacity given Mr. Guo\u2019s outspoken criticism of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Guo agreed to work with Saraca, but insisted that he not be compensated given his prior emphasis that his fight against the CCP is not about money. His entire goal has been to take down the CCP and free his fellow countrymen in China.\u201d\n\nAs to China's allegations, \"the reality is that Mr. Guo is the most wanted person in China because of his outspoken criticism of the Chinese Communist Party; desire to eliminate the CCP\u2019s stranglehold on the Chinese people and bring the rule of law to China,\" Podhaskie said.\n\nThe backstory: Guo and Bannon first met in October 2017, and the two have had numerous meetings since then, the New York Times\u2019 David Barboza reports. Last year, they announced the joint launch of a $100 million \u201cRule of Law Fund\u201d to investigate the deaths and disappearances of Chinese public figures.\n\nGuo told Barboza, \u201cWe both naturally despise the Chinese Communist Party. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve become partners.\u201d\n\nBannon also told the Hill he has recorded a radio show out of Guo\u2019s New York apartment.\n\nAlthough Guo\u2019s spokesperson says the billionaire has no financial stake in Guo Media, Guo has a pervasive presence that dominates the platform.\n\nRead the contracts:", "description": "The mystery of who's funding his work has been at least partly solved.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/h-gueDCcNt3zBdw30MrUJyWMNlY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/28/1572299164401.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
