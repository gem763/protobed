The New York Knicks forward rallied his fan base with a shot back at Kevin Durant after he explained why the Knicks aren\u2019t a hot attraction for players.\n\n\u201cThe cool thing right now is not the Knicks,\u201d said Durant, who passed up the Knicks \u2014 where most thought he\u2019d land \u2014 for the Brooklyn Nets in free agency.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMorris, 30, did ultimately sign with the New York squad in free agency and gave his own stance.\n\nNever was a fan of doing what was cool! I love being a Knick!!! Feeling right at home \u2014 Marcus Morris (@MookMorris2) October 10, 2019\n\nNot cool kids, unite!\n\nThe former Boston Celtics player is with his fifth franchise in nine seasons. He started his career with the Houston Rockets as their 14th overall pick and went to the Phoenix Sun and Detroit Pistons before landing in Boston. What level of \u201ccool\u201d these franchises are is up for debate.\n\nJulius Randle, another free agent signing, also defended his new team this week after the Durant call-out.\n\nVia SNY:\n\n\"S\u2014, I feel cool in blue and orange. I don't know about everybody else but I feel pretty cool wearing my Knicks gear every day. It's a dream come true for me. Everybody has their own opinion.\"\n\nNo one on the roster has an all-star nod, a large hit when taken in the context of superstars teaming up for titles. Durant\u2019s assessment is fair, given the Knicks last NBA Finals appearance was in 1999. The league\u2019s rookies were babies at the time and even those under 30 would have been quite young. New York hasn\u2019t been to the playoffs since 2012-13 and has won only one postseason series since 2001.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are not a lot of accomplishments or current holdings for players to get on board.\n\nMarcus Morris: Un-cool.
