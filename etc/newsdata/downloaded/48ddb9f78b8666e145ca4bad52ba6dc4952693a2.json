Previous Indian governments even began preliminary discussions with Pakistan over access to the shrine.\n\nIt was first discussed in 1998 and then again in 2004 and 2008, but these talks never led to anything concrete.\n\nSince partition, Indians have had limited access to the shrine, often struggling to obtain visas to visit, says BBC Punjabi's Dalip Kumar.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Sikh community in India has long demanded access to the shrine\n\nA historically tense relationship between India and Pakistan - who have fought three wars since 1947 - has made it difficult for a deal to be made.\n\nCorrespondents say the project signals a thaw in relations, although tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours have soared this year.\n\nIn February, India launched air strikes against militants in Pakistani territory in response to a suicide attack in Kashmir which killed 40 Indian soldiers. The Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) group said it had carried out that attack.\n\nIn August, India stripped the part of Kashmir it administers of its partial autonomy, sparking sharp criticism from Pakistan. Since then Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been lobbying for international support against the move, which he has described as \"illegal\".\n\nDelhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption India and Pakistan's 'war-mongering' media\n\nThe signing of the Kartarpur deal itself was delayed by a day, with officials citing \"logistical issues\". On Monday, India said it was \"disappointed\" with Islamabad for insisting on charging pilgrims a $20 (\u00a315) service fee to cross the border - but then said it would still go ahead and sign the deal.\n\nWhat is the significance of the shrine?\n\nThe present shrine was built in 1925 after the original one was destroyed by floods.\n\nThis was later restored by the Pakistani government in 2004.\n\nThe shrine was built to commemorate the site where Guru Nanak spent the last 18 years of his life.\n\nIt is considered to be the second holiest site for Sikhism after Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Pakistan, which was built at the site where Guru Nanak was born.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nPakistan is set to open the corridor early next month, just in time for the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak on 12 November. Devotees from all over the world, including the UK and Canada, are expected to visit for the celebrations.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Construction on the gurdwara's expansion is in its last stages\n\nIt is not yet clear when registration for the permits will open, but many Sikh pilgrims in India have been waiting to visit the shrine for years.\n\nOfficials have said that the corridor will be able to accommodate up to 5,000 pilgrims per day, and up to 10,000 will be able to visit the shrine every day.\n\nAnalysts have said that the Kartarpur border crossing is a significant development and an instance of rare cooperation between the two countries - but they have also said that it would be wrong to suggest that what lies ahead is a peace process.\n\nThey describe it as a confidence building measure but point out that at the end of the day, India and Pakistan are still at loggerheads.", "description": "The new border entry point will allow Indian Sikh pilgrims visa-free access to a shrine in Pakistan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/03B9/production/_104535900_gudwara1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
