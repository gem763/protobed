The maximum guaranteed amount will not exceed 240 baht per kg for each 1,600 sq m per year, and will be limited to 40,000 sq m per farmer.\n\nWhile many see this measure as an attempt by the coalition government to fulfil its campaign promise, the short-term guarantee of income is one of only a few things that Thai rubber growers can count on\n\nSuranee, a rubber farmer in northeastern province of Srisaket, said many have \u201cchanged jobs or diversify income by growing other crops too\u201d.\n\nSuranee is one of the many people in Thailand\u2019s northeast who began rubber farming in the mid-2000s following the government\u2019s bid to tackle poverty by expanding rubber farms at a time rubber prices were flourishing, partly due to China joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001.\n\nBefore that, rubber farming was concentrated in southern Thailand for almost a century. Its warm climate and shorelines ensured Thailand\u2019s competitiveness both in terms of quality and quantity of rubber produce.\n\nIn recent years, China has begun to directly source rubber in Southeast Asia, mostly through partnership with local producers in several countries. Chaiya Kongmanee, economist\n\n\u201cThailand\u2019s annual rubber production is five million tonnes a year,\u201d said Chaiya Kongmanee, an economist at Thailand\u2019s Prince of Songkla University.\n\n\u201cThis makes Thailand the biggest rubber producer. Indonesia\u2019s annual production figure is 3.5 million tonnes, and Vietnam\u2019s is 1.1 million tonnes, China\u2019s is 840,000 tonnes, India\u2019s is 750,000 tonnes and Malaysia\u2019s is 650,000 tonnes,\u201d Chaiya said.\n\nSoutheast Asia \u201cHowever China\u2019s strategy to stabilise and source its rubber supply has changed during the years, and in recent years, it has begun to directly source rubber in, mostly through partnership with local producers in several countries,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is grim news for farmers like Yot in Songkhla.\n\n\u201cWe have read that China has rented out large areas of land in Laos to grow rubber,\u201d Yot said with concern.\n\nSunan Nuanpromsakul, acting head of the Rubber Authority of Thailand, said the government is working to find emerging markets for Thai rubber and expand existing export markets to places such as India, Europe, Japan and South Korea.\n\nJapan South Korea But \u201crubber consumption in these places is still not very high, withand\u2019s demand at 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes a year\u201d, he said.\n\nIndia \u2019s demand is 800,000 tonnes and the country already produces about 700,000 tonnes of rubber annually,\u201d Sunan added.\n\nOther government measures to address plunging rubber prices include loan schemes, programmes to increase processed rubber manufacturing, and upcoming electronic auctions that will allow international traders to offer prices non-dependable on futures trading, according to Sunan. Once these measures are launched, \u201cthe situation should be more reliable by year\u2019s end\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Yot said he and other Songkhla farmers in the local rubber cooperative would hold out for as long as they could.\n\nHe had earlier transferred some 16,000 sq m of land to each of his two children, so they could continue the trade that the family has been carrying out for at least a century.", "description": "Thailand, the world\u2019s largest rubber producer, has seen its exports plummet as the tariff war between Washington and Beijing rages on.", "authors": ["Chaiya Kongmanee"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/24/323ea2c0-f64f-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_195327.JPG?itok=tKzPTf-h&v=1571918016", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
