REUTERS/Kemal Aslan\n\nUnder an accord between Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin a week ago, Syrian border guards and Russian military police were meant to clear all YPG forces and their weapons from a 30 km (19 mile) \u201csafe zone\u201d south of the border by 6 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Tuesday.\n\nIn the next phase of the plan, Russian and Turkish forces are due to conduct joint patrols of a narrower, 10 km strip of land on the Syrian side of the border. Talks on how those patrols will work are continuing, Erdogan said.\n\nTurkey views the YPG as a terrorist organisation because of its links to Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey and attacked the U.S.-allied YPG following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt withdrawal of 1,000 American forces from northern Syria in early October.\n\n\u201cRussia has conveyed to our relevant authorities that terrorist organisations have been fully taken out from (the border area),\u201d Erdogan said in a speech at a celebration in Ankara marking the anniversary of the Turkish Republic.\n\nHe said Turkey\u2019s talks with Russia would continue on Wednesday.\n\nEarlier, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the YPG had completed their withdrawal ahead of the deadline, but a top aide to Erdogan said Turkey would now see through its planned joint patrols with Russia whether the militia had truly left.\n\n\u201cThe time is up. We will establish, through joint patrols, whether or not the terrorists have actually withdrawn,\u201d said Fahrettin Altun, Erdogan\u2019s communications director.\n\nForeign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, speaking at a joint news conference in Geneva with his Russian and Iranian counterparts, said Turkey will eliminate any remaining YPG fighters it sees in the \u201csafe zone.\u201d\n\nThe Putin-Erdogan deal reinforced an existing U.S.-brokered ceasefire that had halted Turkey\u2019s offensive against the Kurds.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry, citing Major General Yuri Borenkov, a senior military official working on Syria, said 68 Kurdish defence units comprising 34,000 people had left the \u201csafe zone\u201d with their weapons and equipment by the deadline.\n\nBorenkov also said the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad - a close ally of Moscow - had set up 84 border outposts on the Syrian-Turkish border. Russia has emerged as the key foreign power in Syria, its influence in the more than eight-year-long war boosted by the U.S. troop withdrawal.\n\nThe Turkish defence ministry said later on Tuesday that 18 people, suspected of being part of Syrian government forces, had been captured in the northern Syrian town of Ras al Ain, which Turkey targeted in its offensive, and added that the issue was being coordinated with Russian officials.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Turkey-backed Syrian rebels said they had arrested an undisclosed number of Syrian army soldiers near Tel Hawa, in the Ras al Ain countryside. A spokesman for the rebels said that the YPG had not fully withdrawn from the border area and that a new round of clashes were expected.\n\nTALKS CONTINUING\n\nA Russian delegation is in Turkey for talks on how the patrols will work and on the wider security situation in northeast Syria.\n\n\u201cJoint patrols will start soon,\u201d Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said on Tuesday evening, without elaborating.\n\nReconnaissance flights and mine clearing operations had begun in the 10 km strip of land where the joint patrols are set to take place, the Turkish defence ministry said. It did not say when the patrols would start.\n\nIn an interview in Tuesday\u2019s edition of the Sabah newspaper, Akar had complained that some Kurdish YPG forces remained in the area of the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\nHe said around 1,000 YPG fighters remained in the border town of Manbij and a further 1,000 in nearby Tel Rifaat. The two towns are to the west of the strip of territory that Turkey wants to turn into a \u201csafe zone\u201d but Syrian and Russian forces are also meant to clear them of YPG forces.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nLater on Tuesday, the Turkish defence ministry said that Russia had informed Turkey that the YPG had been taken beyond 30 km from the Turkish border and out of Manbij and Tel Rifaat, along with their heavy weapons within the deadline.\n\nTurkey\u2019s NATO allies, including the United States, have criticised Ankara\u2019s actions, fearing it will undermine the fight against Islamic State. The YPG is the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that fought alongside Americans to oust Islamic State.\n\nThe United States Special Envoy for Syria Joel Rayburn voiced concern at what he said was the \u201ccontinuing dangerous situation in northeast Syria\u201d and urged all sides to work toward stabilising the region.", "description": "Russia told Turkey that Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters have left a strip of land near the Syrian-Turkish border within a 150-hour deadline set by Ankara and Moscow, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Tuvan Gumrukcu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446279064&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1F0", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
