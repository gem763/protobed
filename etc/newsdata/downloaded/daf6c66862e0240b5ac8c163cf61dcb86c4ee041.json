Between the mileage earned from both, your miles will add up quicker.\n\nAlso, airline credit cards come with various perks specific to that airline that can save you a ton of time and money. Things like complimentary checked bags, priority boarding, and even day passes to airport lounges will have you feeling like you're flying first class even when you're in basic economy.\n\nEach of the three major US airlines (American, Delta, and United) offer a few different credit cards, but among the most popular are the \"mainstream\" cards. These products have annual fees between $95 and $99 \u2014 often waived the first year \u2014 and feature benefits that appeal to everyone from casual fliers to road warriors.\n\nWhile they all have similar features and benefits and all offer a great value to cardholders, we've compared them and found that one stands out above the rest. Read on to see which one it is.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on earning rewards and perks, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards or benefits.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards or take advantage of travel benefits, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back \u2014 or spending more than you would otherwise. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.", "description": "We compared the most popular credit cards from the big US airlines: American, United, and Delta.
