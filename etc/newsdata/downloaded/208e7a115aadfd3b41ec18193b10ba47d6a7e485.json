The Senegal striker reclaimed the ball six yards out, obliging Albrighton to concede a penalty.\n\nSchmeichel and the Leicester players protested furiously but VAR upheld the decision and James Milner struck a last-gasp winner from the spot. It is debatable whether Albrighton would have been penalised had he allowed Schmeichel to gather, though doubt must have existed in his mind. Given his time again he would probably choose the safer course of clearing for a corner.\n\n\u201cWhen you come to the European champions and show resilience like we did, to lose in the 95th minute is hard to take,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cI thought it was a soft penalty, Man\u00e9 has made the most of the contact, but strikers now are clever.\u201d\n\nKlopp was happy to agree with the referee, though he did feel that the cynical challenge by Hamza Choudhury that forced Mo Salah off late in the game was too leniently punished by a yellow card. \u201cI don\u2019t want to cause the boy any problems but he needs to calm down,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cSalah was at full sprint, the ball was far away, there is only one card for that in my eyes. It was as dangerous as hell.\u201d\n\nThough Liverpool led for much of the game Klopp was right to feel the encounter might prove difficult. Leicester are third in the table for a reason, and Liverpool were pushed all the way by a side playing a similarly high-energy, in-your-face sort of game. While Rodgers\u2019 players never did quite enough to look like winning the match they were never out of it either.\n\nLiverpool were in front at the interval thanks to Man\u00e9\u2019s typically confident strike, though the lead could have been greater had Milner shown a little more composure from close range after Trent Alexander-Arnold had tricked Ben Chilwell on the right with a little help from the corner flag. Man\u00e9 shot straight at Schmeichel when the referee played advantage after Wilfred Ndidi upended Milner, and when another Alexander-Arnold cross reached Roberto Firmino at the far post after half an hour the Brazilian could not direct his effort on target.\n\nWhile Leicester probably expected a first-half battering they were just beginning to show some attacking enterprise of their own when they went behind, the ever-reliable Milner sending Man\u00e9 clear down the left with a pass from half way. Momentary hesitation from Jonny Evans saw the Liverpool forward overtake him on the inside, and once he reached the area unchecked a goal was inevitable, Man\u00e9 steering a low shot into the bottom corner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The players lock horns after the final whistle.

In between shots from Firmino, Andy Robertson and Georginio Wijnaldum at Schmeichel\u2019s end Jamie Vardy got just the one sniff at the other, staying onside but showing Adri\u00e1n too much of the ball. The introduction of Ayoze P\u00e9rez made a difference for Leicester \u2013 it was the substitute\u2019s short pass that allowed Maddison to beat Adri\u00e1n with a shot on the turn.\n\nLeicester looked all set for a happy journey home until the drama in stoppage-time turned the afternoon on its head, with P\u00e9rez clearly miffed after the whistle at the exuberance of some of the Liverpool players\u2019 celebrations.", "description": "A stoppage-time penalty for James Milner proved decisive as Liverpool edged to a 2-1 win against Leicester, who had equalised through James Maddison", "authors": ["Paul Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b68885b47c43b7b7eabe5cfe335389c5e3d90dc/0_295_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fcab239a26b1d457f425e70ff709e533", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
