A Reuters poll had forecast a decrease to 51.\n\nMore big price swings are likely as the battle over Brexit enters another crucial phase. Possible outcomes range from a turbulent no-deal exit to abandoning the whole endeavor.\n\nThe British currency is the second worst performing major currency year-to-date, according to Refinitiv data.
