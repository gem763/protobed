To celebrate, Google added a ton of Easter Eggs to search centred around the show\u2019s main characters.\n\nTo find them, simply search a character of your choice and the word \u2018friends.\u2019 For instance, you might search for \u201cRoss Friends\u201d or \u201cPhoebe Friends.\u201d If you remember a character\u2019s full name you can search for that as well.\n\nOn the search results page, you\u2019ll want to go to the knowledge panel for the character on the right side of the page. Below their name, there will be an icon. For instance, when you search for \u201cJoey Tribbiani\u201d you\u2019ll see this knowledge panel with a slice of pizza below his name.\n\nMake sure you have your sound on and click on the pizza to make the Easter Egg appear. I won\u2019t spoil it for you, but if you\u2019re a fan of the show they\u2019re all pretty fun.\n\nThe trick also works for all of the show\u2019s characters, and each one has its own unique character-based easter egg.\n\nAnd for the final surprise, a search for \u201cFriends glossary\u201d will bring up a show-specific glossary with memories from the show. You know, in case you forgot what \u201cunfloopy\u201d means over the past 25 years.", "description": "Friends is turning 25.
