They are just effectively going to be put out of business with a tariff schedule \u2026 [that the government] are not even prepared to look at again. And this is a party that proposes to represent rural Britain?\u201d\n\nOn Sunday the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, insisted the government would \u201cwalk away\u201d from negotiations with Washington if a deal was not \u201cright for Britain\u201d.\n\nShe told John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 Live the government was \u201cnot going to alter domestic standards for the sake of trade deals\u201d.\n\nBut the NFU argues that the trading environment for egg and wheat farmers will change even if there is no trade deal with the US.\n\n\u201cIf you have 0% tariffs on eggs, how are you going to stop eggs, particularly liquid and dried egg, coming into the UK that has been produced in systems that are illegal in the UK?\u201d said Batters.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to see deregulation on animal welfare. The general public don\u2019t either, but do they realise this is happening?\u201d\n\nThe Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said tariffs would only be imposed for 12 months before new deals were struck, but the NFU said that would be too late for some egg producers, who risked going out of business in the face of cheap competition.\n\n\u201cWe have driven one of the safest food systems in the world \u2013 food traceability, farm-assured red tractor, RSPCA and others \u2013 and where is the democracy in making this decision? Parliament hasn\u2019t discussed this. There has been no Panorama programme on it. How do you hold the PM to account?\u201d said Batters.\n\nEgg production is a hugely successful business in the UK, with 90% of the 12bn eggs consumed a year laid by British hens, and the NFU cannot understand why a British government does not want to protect it.\n\n\u201cFarmers feel betrayed. If this is what is going to happen, it is going to put some people out of business, as simple as that \u2013 the simple law of markets and economics,\u201d Batters said.\n\nThe government is legally obliged to publish a tariff schedule under World Trade Organization trading and revealed what rates it had settled on in March with a draft schedule for every potential import from cars to agriculture.\n\n\ufeffDefra said in a statement: \u201cWe will make sure that Brexit works for farmers across the whole country and will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards when we leave the EU.\n\n\u201cOur temporary tariff regime will also balance support for British jobs, protect sensitive farming sectors and avoid consumer price increases should we leave the EU without a deal on 31 October.\u201d", "description": "NFU says government has ignored call for tariffs on cheap US imports from caged hens", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Will Case"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b89604b4437d794c3e16487486d0ece88ac1a54b/0_311_4670_2802/master/4670.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b1bdd9316f8543b6bb19f8f39a11d7a5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
