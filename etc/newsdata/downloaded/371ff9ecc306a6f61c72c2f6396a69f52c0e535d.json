Mattis vowed to speak out on policy issues when the time is right but needs more time away from his most recent role as Pentagon chief before he goes public.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll come a time when I speak out on strategic issues, policy issues, that I do not have a question about,\u201d he said at a Tuesday event hosted by the Center on Foreign Relations. \u201cBut I need to give some period of time to those who have to carry out the responsibility to protect this country in a very, very difficult age.\u201d\n\nThe four-star general abruptly departed the Pentagon at the end of 2018 following disagreements with President Trump over withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nMr. Mattis\u2018 comments come in the midst of negotiations between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Afghanistan\u2019s militant Taliban movement to end the 18-year-long war. It has been reported that roughly 5,000 U.S. troops could leave the country as part of a deal now on the table.\n\nThe former Pentagon chief would not comment on the ongoing situation \u201cbecause I\u2019m not fully aware of the negotiations.\u201d He said he will instead \u201cdefer to those who are trying to carry this out, the State Department and our diplomat there and it wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d\n\nMr. Mattis has largely refrained from commenting on or directly criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s policies since his December resignation.\n\nAlthough the former Marine includes his pointed resignation letter in the new book, he takes greater aim at former President Barack Obama for various foreign policy decisions he disagreed with while serving as the commander of U.S. Central Command under his administration.\n\nMr. Mattis said Tuesday that his latest book, \u201cCall Sign Chaos,\u201d was intended to be about his time in the Marine Corps and published before he was tapped to be secretary of defense.\n\nHe did clarify, however, that he would speak his mind about current events and policy decisions \u201cwhen the time is right.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll know it when it\u2019s right \u2026 when the time\u2019s right to speak out about policy or strategy,\u201d Mr. Mattis said. \u201cWhen a general retires his uniform, he should retire his tongue about political assessments.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
