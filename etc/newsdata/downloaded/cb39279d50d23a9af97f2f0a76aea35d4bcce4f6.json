No times.\u201d\n\nHe expressed anger at Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff for continuing the impeachment inquiry based on lies.\n\n\u201cMaybe we just impeach them because they are lying,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they are doing is a terrible thing to our country.\u201d\n\nTrump also drew cheers after he praised Justice Brett Kavanaugh as a \u201cgood man,\u201d and that Republicans did not back down.\n\n\u201cImpeachment,\u201d Trump says at Values Voter Summit. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d hear that word with regard to me.\u201d\n\nThe president also criticized Republicans for failing to stay united when Democrats attacked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one trait that I do respect and even admire \u2014 they stick together,\u201d he said, referring to the Democrats.\n\nTrump spoke about protecting the First Amendment of free speech, the Second Amendment, and rebuilding a strong military and the right to free speech. He criticized Democrats running for president for pursuing radical leftist policies without consideration for the right to religious freedom.\n\n\u201cSocialism is obsessed with the pursuit of power because it has replaced religion in their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president received a standing ovation when he reminded them that America stood for freedom of religion and the right to life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re under assault, very simple,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn America, we don\u2019t worship government, we worship God,\u201d\n\nWithout naming him, Trump referred to former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke for threatening to remove tax exemption from religious groups who oppose same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cYou know why, you know who it is, he\u2019s a whacko,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president touted his efforts to protect the unborn, ending fetal tissue research, repealing the Mexico City policy, excluded abortion providers from receiving Title X funding and appointing 150 judges to the federal courts.\n\n\u201cIn this administration, we believe that every child born and unborn is made in the holy image of God,\u201d Trump said.", "description": "Donald Trump rallied supporters on Saturday during a speech to Value Voters, as the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry continued.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1175479584-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
