Reeves was born with a left arm that stopped growing just above the elbow.\n\nReeves, with support from her mom, Jen Lee Reeves, has become an advocate for others with limb differences.

In fact, her limb difference inspired her to become a designer, as well as a role model for other kids with physical differences. That's why today is honoring her as a Groundbreaker for International Day of the Girl.\n\nReeves rose to fame in 2016 when she designed a 3D-printed prosthetic arm with a special superpower: it shoots biodegradable glitter in honor of her alter ego, Glitter Girl.\n\nHer nifty prosthetic shoots biodegradable glitter! Courtesy Jen Lee Reeves\n\nShe got the idea at Superhero Cyborgs 2.0, a San Francisco camp for kids with upper limb differences.\n\n\u201cThey told us that we could design anything that we wanted to off of our disability. I decided that I wanted to shoot glitter,\u201d Reeves told TODAY. \u201cIt was just really in the moment, like, \u2018This would be really cool.\u2019\u201d\n\nReeves hard at work on a prototype of Project Unicorn Courtesy Jen Lee Reeves\n\nAfter the camp, Reeves returned home to Columbia, Missouri, and continued working on her prosthetic design, aka Project Unicorn, via weekly calls with a professional designer.\n\nShe worked with a designer to perfect her Project Unicorn prosthetic. Courtesy Jen Lee Reeves\n\nHer mom, Jen Lee Reeves, posted about Project Unicorn online and Reeve\u2019s inspiring story soon went viral.\n\nBefore long, Reeves was everywhere: She made national headlines, gave multiple TEDx talks and even had the chance to pitch Project Unicorn to the \"Shark Tank\" investors during an episode of \"The Rachael Ray Show.\"\n\nThis is a lot for anyone to handle, but Reeves said she\u2019s never felt too nervous in the public eye.\n\nThe 13-year-old has given plenty of public demonstrations of her custom prosthetic. Courtesy Jen Lee Reeves\n\n\u201cI've always been really public about everything, and I've grown up to be confident about myself,\u201d she told TODAY.\n\nReeves has always had a fiercely independent streak, which her parents encouraged as she grew up. Even though she sometimes needed to do things differently because of her arm, her mom and dad allowed her to figure things out by herself.\n\nIn Reeves' eyes, this has made her a great problem solver.\n\n\u201cI like to do stuff on my own,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cI appreciated (my parents\u2019 approach) a lot because I feel like I'd be more needing help with everything and I wouldn't be confident in my ability to do things. I appreciate them doing that.\u201d\n\nReeves has turned her limb difference into a source of strength, but she admits it can still be frustrating when people stare at her arm in public.\n\n\u201cI feel like the hardest part about having a disability is judgment,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really just want to blend in at some times. At some points, you just want to stand out and I get that. But when you do stand out, the stares can really hurt sometimes. I know, personally, I'd like to be seen as my personality and not by my disability because I think I have a good personality.\u201d\n\nFighting for representation\n\nIn 2017, Reeves and her mom co-founded Born Just Right, a nonprofit foundation that brings together families and kids dealing with limb differences and similar challenges.\n\nThe organization also helps kids learn the design and STEM tools they need to find their own creative solutions to living with a physical difference, like Reeves did with Project Unicorn.\n\nNow an author, Reeves signs a copy of \"Born Just Right\" Courtesy Jen Lee Reeves\n\nBuilding on the work of their foundation, the mother-daughter duo recently wrote a book together, \u201cBorn Just Right,\" about Reeves' empowering story.\n\nBoth mother and daughter and fighting to increase awareness and representation for people living with physical differences, including in the toy industry. Reeves petitioned American Girl to create a doll with a limb difference, and she recently worked with Mattel to help them develop a Barbie with a prosthetic leg.\n\nMattel consulted Reeves when designing a Barbie with a limb difference. Courtesy Jen Lee Reeves\n\n\u201cI'm super proud of her,\u201d Jen Lee Reeves told TODAY. \u201cWhat I think people don't realize is this was years and years of work that Jordan has put in \u2026 she's proved that time and energy can really lead to big things if you just keep believing.\u201d\n\nReeves says her mom is one of her biggest female inspirations.\n\n\u201cMy mom (is my role model) because she's always been there for me, and she's confident and amazing, and I love her,\u201d she said.\n\n\"It's magical ... to be her mom,\" Jen Lee Reeves said. Courtesy Jen Lee Reeves\n\nReeves has become a role model herself for other girls living with a disability. She says kids sometimes write to her online or approach her at events to tell her how much she\u2019s inspired them.\n\n\u201cI think it's really cool,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't think I see myself as someone that big, and just knowing that kids are inspired by me just blows my mind.\u201d\n\nNow in the eighth grade, Reeves is busy as ever. She and three other young members of Born Just Right just launched a new youth consultancy, Make Just Right. The idea is that companies will consult them when they need input on inclusive designs, like Mattel sought Jordan's expertise as they designed a Barbie with a prosthetic limb.\n\n\u201cThey're trying to expand the knowledge that they have in design, so more kids can do what she's doing, and give that kind of input to companies that need it,\u201d her mom explained.\n\nThe middle-schooler said she's honored to be an inspiration to other kids with physical differences. Courtesy Jen Lee Reeves\n\nLooking ahead, Reeves' career options seem pretty much limitless. Right now, she\u2019s dreaming of becoming a designer.\n\n\u201cI think I want to be a designer and design cool stuff for accessibility, but also just cool stuff overall,\u201d she said. \u201cWe'll see.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Jordan has some advice for other young girls living with a physical difference.\n\n\u201cMy advice would be just believe in yourself even when times get hard,\u201d she said. \u201cBe confident in your personality no matter how annoying the stares may get \u2026 You can do amazing things, and don't let anyone hold you back.\u201d", "description": "Jordan Reeves, who was born with one full arm, turned her physical difference into a source of strength and inspired countless others in the process.", "authors": ["Lindsay Lowe"], "top_image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_40/1488229/groundbreakers-jordan-today-main-191001_ed56596bcbe74afee5e37a669891cc9e.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
