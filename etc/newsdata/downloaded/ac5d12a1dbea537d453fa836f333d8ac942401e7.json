The device was previously used by MPs to make Theresa May publish the government\u2019s legal advice on Brexit.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s address was designed to force Johnson to say that he would abide by the rule of law, amid suggestions that the prime minister could try to get around legislation mandating him to request a three-month delay to Brexit if there is no deal in place by 19 October.\n\nJohnson\u2019s official spokesman insisted on Monday that he would abide by the rule of law but, at the same time, the prime minister has said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for an extension to article 50. The government accepted that Corbyn\u2019s address had been heard and there was no division for MPs to vote.\n\nThe aim of the Grieve motion was to prove that Johnson and his administration had misled MPs with their claim that the move to shut down parliament for five weeks was not to frustrate debate over Brexit. Grieve said he had asked for the information relating to prorogation because public officials had informed him that \u201cthey believed the handling of this matter smacked of scandal\u201d.\n\n\u201cI can only say that I believe those sources to be reliable and also in my experience it is extraordinarily unusual that I should get such approaches with individuals expressing their disquiet about the handling of this matter,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, senior government aides suggested No 10 would refuse to comply with parliament\u2019s demands for their correspondence, potentially putting Johnson and senior members of his administration in contempt of parliament and creating a fresh clash between the executive and MPs.\n\nCummings has already been found in contempt of parliament once before after failing to appear before a select committee investigating fake news. One government source said the vote was \u201can abuse of parliamentary procedure and would never have been allowed under an impartial speaker\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf MPs want to seize the private texts of advisers to their friends, families, colleagues and journalists then they can speak to people\u2019s lawyers,\u201d they said.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said the scope of information requested was \u201cdisproportionate and unprecedented\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe government is committed to sharing appropriate information with parliament, but we must balance this obligation with the broader public interest, our legal duties and the assurance that ministers can receive full and frank advice that will remain confidential. The scope of the information requested in the [Grieve] humble address is disproportionate and unprecedented,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nAccording to memos from Downing Street read out in a Scottish court last week, Johnson had secretly decided to suspend parliament nearly two weeks before asking the Queen to do so. The court in Edinburgh later ruled that the move was legal, saying it was not a matter for the courts to decide.\n\nHaving lost his fifth vote in parliament in just over a week, Johnson was due on Monday evening to suspend sitting in the House of Commons and House of Lords until 14 October \u2013 a move condemned by opposition parties and anti-no-deal Tories. He was then expected to lose yet another vote on his request for a general election.\n\nCriticising the prorogation, Corbyn, said it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and accused Johnson of wanting to run away from questions.\n\nSpeaking at the Trade Union Congress on Tuesday, Corbyn is expected to stress that he will not allow Johnson to dictate the terms of a forthcoming general election, warning that \u201cno one can trust the word of a prime minister who is threatening to break the law to force through no deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur priority is, first, to stop no deal, and then to trigger a general election,\u201d Corbyn will say, after Labour refused to back Johnson\u2019s demand for an election in mid-October, while a no-deal exit is still possible at the end of that month.\n\n\u201cAmber Rudd\u2019s resignation confirmed that the government is not serious about trying to get a deal in Brussels. As the prime minister\u2019s top adviser reportedly said, the negotiations are \u2018a sham.\u2019\n\n\u201cNo one can trust the word of a prime minister who is threatening to break the law to force through no deal. So a general election is coming. But we won\u2019t allow Johnson to dictate the terms.\u201d", "description": "Fresh setback for PM as he moves to shut down parliament for five weeks", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/978b3a87aa79a109e46d75e567b31eb725386d02/1149_68_2436_1461/master/2436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb4f6887576e03868becac539347be61", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
