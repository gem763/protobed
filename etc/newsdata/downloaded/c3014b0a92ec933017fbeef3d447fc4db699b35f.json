Republicans staged a protest over the secretive nature of the proceedings and stepped up their demands for the probe to be conducted in the open.\n\nRep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.) said Democrats would move the investigation into a public setting \u201cas soon as we have completed the gathering of evidence and that we are ready to make a presentation.\u201d He said he expected that within weeks, not months\u2014and before the introduction of any articles of impeachment\u2014already-given testimony would be made public or witnesses would openly testify.\n\n\u201cThe commencement of public hearings before Thanksgiving is a reasonable objective\u2014as it\u2019s important for Americans to begin seeing the evidence as soon as possible,\u201d said Rep. Dean Phillips (D., Minn.).\n\nMessrs. Cicilline and Phillips are members of the foreign-affairs committee, one of the panels running the impeachment inquiry.\n\nNearly all of the witnesses who have testified in front of the committees have done so behind closed doors in the basement of the U.S. Capitol building. Democrats describe the interviews as part of the investigation\u2019s early, fact-finding stage. Republicans on the committees are invited to participate and can ask as many questions as they like, according to members of both parties.\n\nRepublicans argue that the process isn\u2019t fair to Mr. Trump and say the interviews should be open to all lawmakers. On Wednesday, several dozen Republicans stormed into a secure meeting room and delayed by several hours the testimony of a Pentagon witness. The protest drew praise from the White House.\n\n\u201cDems have been doing everything behind closed doors and in secret, and so it\u2019s about time somebody made a very bold stand,\u201d Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said Thursday on Fox News.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced a resolution Thursday condemning the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. The resolution calls for the House to take a formal vote on opening an inquiry and for lawmakers to allow Mr. Trump to confront accusers. On Twitter, he listed 44 co-sponsors to the resolution, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.).\n\nMr. Graham was among a group of Senate Republicans who went to the White House on Thursday for lunch with the president and said Mr. Trump repeated that he was focused on clearing his name.\n\n\u201cThe bulk of the lunch, about 40, 45 minutes, was the president saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u2019 and senators saying, \u2018Mr. President, we agree that the process is flawed, but the best thing you can do is keep governing the country,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Graham said.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has said there is no need for a vote authorizing the impeachment probe but hasn\u2019t ruled it out. On whether to hold public sessions, Democrats have argued that closed-door initial interviews are needed to prevent witnesses from coordinating their testimony.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a former prosecutor,\u201d said Rep. Ted Lieu (D., Calif.), who sits on the foreign-affairs committee, one of the panels conducting the inquiry. \u201cWe would never do witness interviews in public. And so, what the Republicans are asking for is insane.\u201d He said public hearings would take place once the committees finish their investigation.\n\nConducting witness interviews behind closed doors has been a common tactic in recent high-profile investigations. For instance, the House, then controlled by the GOP, conducted an inquiry into the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, largely behind closed doors.\n\nPast impeachment efforts have been conducted in differing ways. Independent counsel Kenneth Starr conducted his probe of President Clinton using a grand jury behind closed doors. In the Watergate investigation of President Nixon, a grand jury was used to collect evidence that was eventually sent to Congress. Several key players in Watergate testified publicly in front of a Senate panel, in an investigation separate from the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe GOP protest this week came a day after Bill Taylor, a top U.S. diplomat in Kyiv, said in his prepared testimony that Mr. Trump made nearly $400 million in aid contingent on the Ukrainian president investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The issue of why the Ukraine aid was held up is a central focus on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr. Trump has denied any quid pro quo and has called the impeachment inquiry a witch hunt.\n\nDemocrats called Mr. Taylor\u2019s testimony damning and said the GOP protest was intended as a distraction from it. Some Republicans argued that they heard nothing new in the testimony and that because of the closed nature of the testimony, the public wasn\u2019t getting a full picture.\n\nOn Saturday, Philip Thomas Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, is scheduled to appear. Mr. Reeker is expected to be asked about what other witnesses have described as dual foreign policy channels regarding Ukraine, and about the ouster of Marie Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nLate Wednesday, Democrats also announced two new witnesses for next week. Former Deputy National Security Adviser Charles Kupperman is expected on Monday. Mr. Kupperman was on the July 25 call between Messrs. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, The Wall Street Journal has reported, and he would be the first witness with firsthand knowledge of the call to testify in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAlexander Vindman, the director of European affairs at the National Security Council, is expected to appear in closed session next Tuesday, an official working on the impeachment inquiry said late Thursday. Mr. Vindman was one of a handful of Trump administration representatives who attended Mr. Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May.\n\nKathryn Wheelbarger, the acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, is expected Wednesday, according to the official. Along with Laura Cooper, a career Pentagon official who testified on Wednesday, Ms. Wheelbarger would have likely been involved in discussions about the freeze on military aid to Ukraine this summer, according to former Pentagon officials. Ms. Wheelbarger would be the second Pentagon official to testify in the impeachment inquiry despite efforts by the Defense Department to not comply with the investigation.\n\nA current White House official, Timothy Morrison, who is a special assistant to the president, is scheduled for Thursday.\n\nMr. Morrison was described in testimony by Mr. Taylor as a person who informed Mr. Taylor of a conversation between Mr. Trump and Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union. In that conversation, Mr. Taylor said he was told that Mr. Trump insisted that Mr. Zelensky publicly say he was opening investigations of Mr. Biden and his son, as well as 2016 election interference.\n\nCommittee staff is in ongoing discussions with witnesses to schedule more testimony, according to an aide working on the investigation.\n\nIf the House, controlled by the Democrats, impeaches Mr. Trump, the matter then would move to the Republican-led Senate for a trial, but the two chambers haven\u2019t set any agreement on timing. Republican senators, including Mr. McConnell, have speculated that a trial could happen between the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. But Mrs. Pelosi hasn\u2019t committed to a time frame. She has said that she would like the probe conducted expeditiously but that the calendar would depend on what the investigation finds.\n\nMany lawmakers have indicated they would like to finish the process before the presidential primaries. Asked if he sees the impeachment inquiry wrapping up before the end of the year, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said: \u201cThat would be my hope.\u201d\n\n\u2014Dustin Volz and Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com", "description": "House Democrats plan to move ahead with more closed-door interviews in their impeachment inquiry despite stepped-up demands from Republicans to conduct the investigation in public.", "authors": ["Natalie Andrews", "Jesse Naranjo", "Natalie.Andrews Wsj.Com", "Jesse.Naranjo Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-120409/social", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
