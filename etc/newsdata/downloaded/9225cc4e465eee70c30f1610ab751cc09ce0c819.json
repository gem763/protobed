(Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)\n\nWaiters Island is going to be embargoed to open the 2019 NBA season.\n\nThe Miami Heat announced Saturday night that guard Dion Waiters had been suspended for the team\u2019s season opener for \u201cconduct detrimental to the team.\u201d Heat president Pat Riley was quoted as saying the suspension stemmed from \u201ca number of unacceptable incidents this week, culminating with his unprofessional conduct on the bench last night.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHeat president Pat Riley's statement on Dion Waiters one-game suspension: pic.twitter.com/wGFYMP9PTK \u2014 Al Butler (@ALaboutSports) October 20, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s currently unknown what specific instances caused Waiters\u2019 suspension, but what we definitely know is that what some hoped could be a resurgent year for the mercurial guard will have to wait a few more days to get started.\n\nThe Heat are scheduled to begin their season at home on Wednesday against the rebuilding Memphis Grizzlies. They\u2019ll face a stiffer test next Saturday with Waiters back, facing the Milwaukee Bucks on the road.\n\nWaiters averaged 12.0 points on .530 true shooting last year, with 2.8 assists and 2.6 rebounds per game.\n\nWith Waiters out, a starting spot for the Heat\u2019s first game could be opened up for rookie Tyler Herro. The 13th overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft has looked like a steal in preseason action between his sharpshooting and playmaking, though he has drawn some (mock) disapproval from star Jimmy Butler.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Heat are embargoing Waiters Island to open the 2019 NBA season.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HehLPgv.J3DCQONFkXuqNQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MTcuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/78773BAgFlYBGg08GfOLHQ--~B/aD0zMDg0O3c9NDgyOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/935db470-f2f2-11e9-b677-ba65194d2a34", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
