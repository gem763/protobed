Forget the pleas that his team still have to work to do to match the traditional top six.\n\nBrendan Rodgers believes Leicester can have a glorious season and there will no allowances made for those who do not join him on the journey.\n\nWhen he left the field to a standing ovation 11 minutes from time, the impressive Harvey Barnes might have expected warm words from his manager.\n\nBrendan Rodgers believes his Leicester team can have a glorious season in the Premier League\n\nThe 21-year-old created the equaliser for Jamie Vardy with an insidious left-wing cross and had grown into the game, causing Burnley problems in the second half with his direct running.\n\nHe was also involved in Youri Tielemans\u2019 winner.\n\nBut Rodgers has no time for one good performance, followed by a couple of average ones.\n\nHe knows he has a squad capable of reaching the Champions League next season and is demanding Champions League standards to get there.\n\nJamie Vardy rose highest to head in Leicester's equalising goal against Burnley\n\n\u2018Our wingers need to do more, both in terms of goals and contributions,\u2019 he said. \u2018The problem is that they are better when they come off the bench.\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t go through the season as a winger with one goal or two goals. There is potential there but there needs to be greater efficiency if we want to be at the top end of this league.\n\n\u2018We cannot always rely on the same players to score the goals \u2014 Jamie Vardy, Youri Tielemans. These guys work very hard but it\u2019s about producing and that takes time as well. This is a big level and, if we want to be up there, there\u2019s a price.\n\n'There\u2019s a big demand on them to press, to be aggressive, but also to create chances and score goals. There needs to be a will as well, to run towards the ball, not be static.\n\nYouri Tielemans celebrated after scoring the winning goal at the King Power Stadium\n\n\u2018Can you coach that? Yes, absolutely. You can open up the idea of scoring and creating.\n\nTime is on Barnes\u2019 side. This is his first full Premier League season after spending the first half of 2018-19 on loan at West Bromwich Albion, though he has now been served notice that there is little margin for error under Rodgers.\n\nLeicester\u2019s start to the season has drawn deserved attention but Burnley\u2019s opening two months merit equal praise.\n\nThe Foxes have now benefited from three tight VAR calls \u2014 against Wolves on the opening weekend of the season, against Tottenham on September 22 and again here.\n\nRodgers says Harvey Barnes must become more efficient if he is to succeed at Leicester\n\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche was outraged that a potential second goal, bundled into his own net by Jonny Evans under pressure from Burnley\u2019s goalscorer Chris Wood, was overturned by referee Jon Moss after VAR adjudged a deliberate trip by Wood on the former Manchester United defender.\n\nWood said: \u2018There\u2019s no way of him clearing it so in my opinion it should stand.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a clear and obvious foul to over-rule. A little bit of contact can be accidental. We have seen challenges in the box where there has been contact and penalties haven\u2019t been given. Not every contact is a foul.\u2019\n\nChris Wood had an equaliser disallowed after he was deemed to have tripped Jonny Evans\n\nNaturally, Evans took the opposite view but was thankful for a victory achieved under difficult circumstances.\n\nThe first anniversary of the death of former Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who was killed when his helicopter crashed near the King Power Stadium on October 27 last year, is now six days away.\n\nThis was the closest home game to the anniversary and the club and its supporters paid a fitting tribute.\n\nEvans said: \u2018Once the whistle is blown, you have to try to focus but it\u2019s hard to put your emotions to one side. It was obviously a very tough time for the club and the club have handled it exceptionally well.\u2019", "description": "TOM COLLOMOSSE AT THE KING POWER STADIUM: Forget the public caution.
