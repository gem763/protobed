And Lizzo and Prince blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\n\nBut others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support.\n\nSaturday\u2019s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event\u2019s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day.\n\nMany of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.\n\nPolk County Democrats' chairman Sean Bagniewski said organizers had sold more than 12,000 tickets, purchased more than 10,500 steaks (plus vegan options for vegan candidates U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii) and counted roughly 18,000 candidate signs scattered across the park.\n\n\"This is the biggest steak fry in history,\" he said.\n\nEach candidate was given 10 minutes to speak. The only major candidate not in attendance was former U.S. Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who was attending his daughter's wedding.\n\nRaindrops began falling ahead of the event, but Iowa Democratic Party chair Troy Price appeared relaxed about the potential for a downpour. Iowa Democrats have fared well in both rain and heat at previous steak fry events, he said.\n\n\u201cThey have endured all weather,\u201d Price said. \"And they still come because they know this is a great opportunity to see the candidates and a great opportunity to show just how committed we are to the democratic process.\u201d\n\nThe rain held off for almost the entire event, but the skies opened up as the final candidate, U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, spoke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m prepared for this,\" Ryan said, pausing as it began to rain harder. \"I\u2019ve got my Progress Iowa hat.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad joined Ryan on stage, holding an umbrella over the congressman\u2019s head so he could finish, even as most attendees headed for the exits.\n\nTom Vilsack, a former Democratic Iowa governor and former U.S. agriculture secretary under President Barack Obama, said the Steak Fry can send a message to Iowans.\n\n\u201cWe are giving them an opportunity to make the case \u2014 to make a strong, passionate, enthusiastic and thoughtful case \u2014 for their candidacy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat separates them, what\u2019s unique, about their campaign. This is a great forum.\u201d\n\nSign wars\n\n\"The speeches are certainly important. That's one part of it,\" Bagniewski said Saturday. \"... The most important thing, I would say, are the rallies.\"\n\nEach of the candidates had space outside the event where they rallied their supporters, and many of them organized marches into the venue to showcase their organizational strength and volunteer enthusiasm.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, when he was a candidate in 2007, set the standard for those marches when he arrived with more than 1,000 people and wowed the crowd, Bagniewski said. Since then, other campaigns have attempted to replicate that moment.\n\nOn Saturday, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Biden and U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California appeared to have the largest and most energetic supporter groups.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s rally began in the early morning with a performance by Relaxed Fit, a jazz band from Cedar Rapids. And the campaign bused in the Clay High School Marching Band from South Bend to hype the crowd. Later, in a mass of golden T-shirts and signs, Buttigieg and his supporters marched toward the Steak Fry, chanting \u201cI-O-W-A, Mayor Pete all the way!\u201d as the crowd crawled down the narrow street.\n\nLeading the crowd was Sam Ingersoll, a 47-year-old supporter from Iowa City, clad in an inflatable dinosaur costume.\n\n\u201cMy daughter says I\u2019m \u2018extra,\u2019\u201d Ingersoll said, his voice emanating from deep within the dinosaur\u2019s neck.\n\nBiden\u2019s pre-Steak Fry rally had a block party feel, complete with a bouncy castle, lawn games, pancakes and an ice cream truck. The campaign bused in supporters from around the state and said they have contacted more likely caucusgoers in the week leading up to the Steak Fry than in any other one-week period this year.\n\nBiden\u2019s march into the event was led by a fire truck and the Union Crusaders drill team from Waterloo, who danced, chanted and played drums.\n\nThe former vice president promised supporters that if he got the nomination, he would beat President Donald Trump \u201clike a drum.\u201d He also urged them to get involved in his campaign.\n\n\u201cThis is how we move to Iowa,\u201d Harris said as she greeted her supporters ahead of the Steak Fry after marching in with SEIU members and the Fight for 15 movement.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m kind of moving to Iowa. But in my heart \u2014 I mean, I did actually pack my stuff up,\u201d she added, referencing her plans to double her staff in the state and spend more time here.\n\nHarris\u2019 energetic supporters prepared for her arrival with dances and chants of \u201cKAM-ALA, Kamala Harris all the way.\u201d The Isiserettes drumline led her supporters on a march into the main event.\n\nHarris also struck a note of unity.\n\n\u201cWe know that we are fighting for the best of who we are as a nation, and we know the greatest power in our fight is the people and the fact that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us,\u201d she said.\n\nVoter contact\n\nTwo others, Sanders of Vermont and Warren of Massachusetts, opted to focus on voter outreach and organizing rather than big visual displays.\n\nSanders built a small tent at his rally site staffed by just a couple of people. There, the team leaned a wooden door against the tent and posted a sign that said \u201cOut door-knocking. Be back later.\u201d The sign kept a running tally of the number of voters the campaign had contacted throughout the day, building to a total of 27,000 phone calls and more than 7,500 doors knocked, the campaign said.\n\n\u201cThis is how we'll win the election,\u201d Sanders\u2019 Iowa state director, Misty Rebik, tweeted.\n\nWarren\u2019s team adopted a similar approach, but focused its organizing efforts on the more than 12,000 Democrats who attended the Steak Fry.\n\nInstead of a large rally or march, volunteers fanned out to speak with Iowa Democrats about her story and the issues she's running on. The campaign used its rally spot as an \u201cOrganizing HQ\u201d to train volunteers on canvassing, including tips on how best to approach potential supporters.\n\nVolunteers were easy to spot as they canvassed the crowd with \u201cliberty green\u201d clipboards and balloons \u2014 the color of the Statue of Liberty and the signature tint of the Warren campaign. Many wore buttons that said, \u201cAsk me about Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nWarren and Sanders both addressed supporters, but they did not march into the event. Afterward, Warren stayed for her signature \u201cselfie\u201d line, taking 1,050 photos in two hours, according to her campaign.\n\nCrowd-pleasers\n\nMany of the campaigns purchased tickets in bulk and distributed them to volunteers, helping to ensure friendly crowds.\n\nAccording to event organizers, Biden purchased the most, at 1,800. Buttigieg purchased 1,500 tickets, Harris had 1,000 (though she turned out an additional 200 people who attended her non-ticketed rally), and Warren bought 750. Booker and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke each purchased 500 tickets, and Klobuchar bought 325. Sanders, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Castro all purchased 200. Activist Tom Steyer bought 100, and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado bought 80.\n\nButtigieg seemed to generate the most raw enthusiasm from the crowd \u2014 much like he did at the Democratic Wing Ding event in Clear Lake last month.\n\n\u201cBecause when I\u2019m your nominee, this president will have to compete with an American war veteran on the subject of who would make a better commander in chief,\u201d he said.\n\nWarren also drew an enthusiastic response as she took the stage. As she said \u201cI have a plan,\u201d the crowd erupted, and when she talked about her proposed wealth tax, the crowd chanted \u201cTwo cents! Two cents!\u201d back at her.\n\nBiden, who also was well-received, drew cheers when he spoke about climate change.\n\n\u201cFolks, as president, the first thing I will do is rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and, within 100 days, within 100 days, call a meeting of all the major nations in the world to come to Washington to up the ante. Because they are responsible for 85% of all the pollution.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar was applauded for going after Trump.\n\n\u201cWe have a guy that would rather lie than lead,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026 He gloats about an economy he didn\u2019t create \u2026 then, when anything goes wrong from his own making \u2014 from his trade war, from his ethanol waivers, from how he handles the farm economy \u2014 what does he do? He whines.\u201d\n\nBooker on the ropes\n\nThough the event had the air of a festival, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey took some time before the event to speak frankly about the state of his campaign.\n\nBooker, speaking with reporters in the back of his campaign van before the event, said he needs to see more \u201cfundraising success\u201d if he wants a better chance at becoming the Democratic nominee.\n\nEarlier in the morning, his campaign issued a memo to supporters announcing an ambitious fundraising goal: raising $1.7 million over the next 10 days.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t raise that, we do not have what we need to grow this campaign to win,\u201d he said.\n\nBooker has more than 50 staff working in the state along with more than 50 endorsements, including the largest stable of state lawmakers in the Democratic field.\n\nBut he said he doesn\u2019t want his campaign to become a \u201cvanity project.\u201d When asked if he would drop out or cut staff if he doesn\u2019t raise the money, he said the campaign would have to make \u201ctough\u201d choices.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t raise that money, we\u2019ll have to have a serious moment of introspection,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral of those lawmakers, state Reps. Amy Nielsen, Kenan Judge, Heather Matson and Jennifer Konfrst, spoke at Booker\u2019s pre-Steak Fry rally, hyping the red-shirted crowd before the march to the event.\n\nBooker led about 200 supporters down the path to the event, standing next to a full-throated organizer with a bullhorn leading chants like \u201cHope. Hype. Hustle.\u201d and \u201cI believe that we will rise.\u201d\n\nDuring his speech, he echoed his campaign\u2019s \u201cnow or never\u201d memo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call to you right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI need everyone\u2019s help with my campaign because we\u2019re not running an individual campaign. We will win this election not by dividing Democrats but (having) people that unite us and bring us together.\u201d\n\nBooker stayed around for a couple of hours after his speech to take photos with attendees and mingle with the crowd.\n\nDemocrats talk impeachment\n\nAs she took the stage, Warren called for Trump's impeachment \u2014 a message she\u2019s renewed in the wake of reports that Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate the business dealings of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, in that country.\n\nWarren called for Trump\u2019s impeachment in April, when the Mueller report was released, saying the findings proved Trump welcomed the help of a foreign government that had attacked the country\u2019s election system, and tried to obstruct justice when the government investigated.\n\n\u201cI read all 448 pages, and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump,\u201d she said to raucous cheers Saturday. \u201cCongress failed to act, and now Donald Trump has shown he believes he\u2019s above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system. It is time for us to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now.\u201d\n\nHarris, too, addressed Trump, drawing cheers for a line that has become common in her stump speeches: \u201cDude\u2019s gotta go!\u201d\n\n\u201cDude\u2019s gotta go!\u201d some in the crowd chanted back at her.\n\nAfter listing a series of examples where Harris said Trump took the word of a foreign dictator over the word of the U.S. intelligence community, Harris referenced the news reports about Ukraine.\n\n\u201cJust in the last 48 hours, yet again we find that he is in cahoots with a foreign government to manipulate the outcome of this election for president of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cIowa, we need a new commander in chief. And we need to, absolutely, by the way, begin impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\nBiden also addressed Trump when taking questions from reporters. He called Trump \u201ca serial abuser\u201d of power and accused him of bullying a foreign leader and violating presidential norms. Biden has resisted calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment, but said the House should investigate the president\u2019s actions to see if impeachment is warranted.\n\n\u201cDepending on what the House finds, he could be impeached, but I\u2019m not making that judgment now,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe House should investigate it. The House should investigate it. This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power, to get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things \u2014 if that\u2019s what happened. That appears to be what happened.\u201d\n\nFrom the stage, Castro addressed \u201cmy House Democratic friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time for you to do your job and impeach Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many crimes does this president have to do before Congress will act and impeach him?\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke leans into gun control message\n\nO\u2019Rourke made news when he said on a presidential debate stage that \u201chell, yes,\u201d he would support a mandatory buyback of assault-style weapons, and he seemed to embrace the phrase as an unofficial rallying cry at the Steak Fry.\n\nHis supporters, at their rally site ahead of the event, held signs with each letter, spelling out \u201chell, yes.\u201d\n\nAnd when O\u2019Rourke took the stage, he recalled the debate stage moment.\n\n\u201cThe people of El Paso, Texas, are the ones who gave me voice to say, \u2018Hell, yes, we are going to buy back every AR-15 and AK-47 in this country,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cGet those off the streets and out of our homes so that no one ever has to fear that again.\u201d\n\nHe said gun control advocates should not let corporations, the National Rifle Association, political action committees \u201cor even our fellow Democrats\u201d tell them what is possible.\n\n\u201cWe the people decide what is possible in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd ladies and gentlemen, that is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020. That is how we bring a deeply divided country back together again. Are you with me on this? Let me hear you say, \u2018Hell, yes!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe crowd shouted back, \u201cHell, yes!\"\n\n\u201cYou with me on this?\u201d he asked again.\n\n\u201cHell, yes!\u201d they answered.\n\nRegister reporters Kim Norvell, Austin Cannon, Barbara Rodriguez, Stephen Gruber-Miller, Katie Akin, Shelby Fleig and Robin Opsahl contributed to this report.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is Chief Politics Reporter for the Register.
