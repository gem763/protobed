Sorry, but they do.\n\nThe fourth Democratic presidential primary debate opened by asking all 12 participants about impeachment. Once the round-robin was finished, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper turned to Joe Biden and asked this carefully phrased question:\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump\u2019s attempts to get political dirt on Vice President Biden and his son. President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there\u2019s no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you. Having said that, on Sunday, you announced if you are president, no one in your family will be involved in any foreign businesses. My question is, if it\u2019s not okay for a president\u2019s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it okay for your son when you were vice president?\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cI did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. That\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d\n\nChastened, the moderators moved on to ask Elizabeth Warren about whether she\u2019d raise taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all. But even that, apparently, had been too much. A few minutes later, asked his views on a federal job guarantee, Sen. Cory Booker denounced the moderators for subjecting Biden to such humiliating scrutiny. \u201cI saw this play in 2016\u2019s election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are ... elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. The only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nA few things are true about the Hunter Biden story. One is that there\u2019s no evidence Joe Biden did what Donald Trump has accused him of doing: pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect his son from investigation.\n\nBut another is that Hunter Biden poses real problems for Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, and if Democrats pretend otherwise, they\u2019re making a mistake.\n\nMany Democrats consider raising the Hunter Biden question unfair to Joe Biden. Why should he have to answer for the legal actions of his adult son? But no one said politics was fair. And if Democrats avoid the issue, they can be certain Trump will not. Biden\u2019s vulnerability here needs to be tested in the primary, when Democrats have other choices, rather than in the general, when they won\u2019t.\n\nThe problems Hunter Biden creates for Joe Biden\n\nHunter Biden isn\u2019t a natural gas expert, and he\u2019s not a Ukraine expert. But he was son of the then vice president of the United States. And that\u2019s why he was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on Burisma\u2019s board \u2014 among others. The New Yorker\u2019s investigation, which predates the revelation of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, put it well:\n\nSeveral former officials in the Obama Administration and at the State Department insisted that Hunter\u2019s role at Burisma had no effect on his father\u2019s policies in Ukraine, but said that, nevertheless, Hunter should not have taken the board seat. As the former senior White House aide put it, there was a perception that \u201cHunter was on the loose, potentially undermining his father\u2019s message.\u201d The same aide said that Hunter should have recognized that at least some of his foreign business partners were motivated to work with him because they wanted \u201cto be able to say that they are affiliated with Biden.\u201d A former business associate said, \u201cThe appearance of a conflict of interest is good enough, at this level of politics, to keep you from doing things like that.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t illegal for Hunter Biden to take that job. But Hunter Biden himself has admitted it was \u201cpoor judgment.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of nothing so much as the $675,000 Hillary Clinton took for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs: not illegal, but a kind of soft corruption that voters find loathsome.\n\nClinton and Biden both make the same argument: The money \u2014 in Clinton\u2019s case direct, in Biden\u2019s case to his son \u2014 didn\u2019t affect their decisions. I believe Biden on this. But these are huge sums and represent a kind of DC back-scratching and influence-trading that voters dislike. Getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for doing basically no work is a rare gift, and the cost of accepting that gift or of letting a family member accept it is it can be used against you in a future election.\n\nNone of this is news to Biden. As the Intercept\u2019s Ryan Grim documented, Biden has faced attacks for decades over not just Hunter\u2019s work, but his brother James\u2019s efforts to cash in on his name, so he knew this was a vulnerability long before Burisma. Biden\u2019s answer here seems to have been to create a personal firewall about the topics he\u2019d discuss with Hunter. \u201cI never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one has indicated I have. We kept everything separate.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s unusual about this case is Hunter Biden appears to have inadvertently done his country a great service: He lured Donald Trump into openly extorting a foreign country to investigate the son of a domestic political rival. It\u2019s an important revelation that has launched an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump and may help Democrats win back the White House. But is Joe Biden going to be the strongest Democratic contender in this conversation? Or will his ability to make the case be compromised, as every time he attacks Trump for soliciting foreign assistance, Trump will counter with allegations about why exactly Hunter Biden was being paid so much money by a Ukrainian natural gas giant?\n\nHere is a list of people who have criticized Hunter Biden of Nepotism in the last 24 hours:\n\n\n\nPresented to you by 23andMe.\n\n\n\nMeghan McCain\n\nAbby Huntsman\n\nDonald Trump Jr.\n\nIvanka Trump\n\nJaren Kushner\n\nRand Paul\n\nMs. Romney (Ronna) \u2014 YS (@NYinLA2121) October 15, 2019\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s exploits also make it hard for Biden to launch what should be a broader, and damning, attack on Trump: that he\u2019s compromised and corrupted the government through nepotism and self-dealing. Twitter is full of liberals mocking the hypocrisy of the Trump children for attacking Biden, but the money Hunter Biden made trading on the Biden name weakens Joe Biden\u2019s ability to make the case against Trump\u2019s nepotism and corruption, even though it\u2019s clearly one of Trump\u2019s core vulnerabilities.\n\nHunter Biden and Hillary\u2019s emails\n\nBooker, like other Democrats I\u2019ve heard, analogized talking about Hunter Biden\u2019s job in Ukraine to talking about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u2014 an unfair smear that is legitimized when raised by the media or other candidates. \u201cI am having deja vu all over again,\u201d he said.\n\nMe too, but for a different reason.\n\nIn 2016, Bernie Sanders famously refused to attack Clinton\u2019s emails in the debates. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails,\u201d he said to applause. The result was that rather than Democrats realizing how damaging that story was \u2014 and how ineffective Clinton was at putting it to rest \u2014 during the primary, they found that out in the general election. And yes, the media deserves the blame for the coverage decisions, but Democrats can\u2019t simply assume the media won\u2019t make the same mistakes in 2020. The lesson of Clinton\u2019s emails is that unfair smears can help Donald Trump get elected.\n\nI\u2019m not arguing that any of this disqualifies Joe Biden. He may yet prove the strongest Democratic candidate. But it would be unwise for Democrats to refuse to scrutinize him out of some misplaced sense that admitting the vulnerability is playing into Trump\u2019s hands or is unfair to Biden. What would be playing into Trump\u2019s hands is ignoring an obvious vulnerability so that he can exploit it later.\n\nListen to Today, Explained\n\nIn the fourth Democratic debate, the candidates treated Elizabeth Warren as the frontrunner.
