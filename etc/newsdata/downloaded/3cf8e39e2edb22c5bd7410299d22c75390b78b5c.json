An in-game menu that was being used to list new downloadable tomb levels suddenly listed an eighth slot. The game\u2019s publisher had only ever promised seven.\n\nAt the time, there was still one more of the game\u2019s seven announced bonus tombs to come. Those tombs had been released more or less once a month since the game launched. The final one went live on April 23. Since then, that eighth spot has remained a mystery, and the people behind Shadow of the Tomb Raider won\u2019t say anything about it.\n\nFans have wondered: Why is there an eighth tomb listed when the game\u2019s $44 season pass was only hyped to offer seven? Would this eighth tomb be released for all players for free? Or cost money? Would it be an extension of the season pass?\n\nShadow Of The Tomb Raider's Piecemeal Season Pass Ultimately Improved The Game Last year\u2019s Shadow of the Tomb Raider had a season pass with a packed lineup that must have sounded great in its publisher\u2019s boardroom and maybe in the ears of some fans: seven expansions, one a month, adding a new tomb each time. Can\u2019t miss, right? Read more\n\nUnfortunately, publisher Square Enix and the game\u2019s development studios have been silent. A rep for the publisher didn\u2019t comment on this when we asked in April, nor when we asked again in August and a third time earlier this week.\n\nAt the unofficial Tomb Raider Forums, there\u2019s a 536-page thread dedicated to the mystery of the eighth tomb slot. There, fans speculate about the possibility that data-miners detected evidence of a tomb based on Croft Manor. It is a timeline of a community\u2019s anticipation and disappointment. About 100 pages in, it\u2019s June and the game\u2019s fans are typing live reactions to Square Enix\u2019s E3 press conference. Once a trailer for the marquee Avengers title, which will presumably close the show, starts airing, the Tomb Raider fans realise they\u2019re not getting any news about the eighth tomb. \u201cSqeenix can take that 8th DLC and cram it,\u201d one user writes. \u201cThey could have at least said not to expect anything, but they must live for us being disappointed.\u201d Over the next 400 pages, the cycle repeats. August\u2019s Gamescom show becomes similarly deflating for this loyal group.\n\nFans aren\u2019t forgetting. Recent Tweets from the official Tomb Raider account about topics unrelated to the eighth tomb get replies about them. An August 30 Tweet about fan art elicited: \u201clol NO. we want DLC8.\u201d A September 9 Tweet confirming the production of a new Tomb Raider movie garnered a \u201dYay!!! DLC8 announced soon? :D\u201d\n\nTomorrow marks the one-year anniversary of Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u2019s release. At the Tomb Raider Forums, fans peg that as the last best chance to get news of the eighth tomb. Maybe they\u2019ll announce it. Maybe Square Enix will announce a whole compilation re-release of the whole game and all its DLC and throw in an eighth tomb as a bonus. Maybe, maybe, maybe.\n\nOr, as one user writes on page 534: \u201cI think it\u2019s time to move on, for real this time. It\u2019s healthier to just assume it\u2019s cancelled and if it ever comes, surprise, it finally came.\u201d", "description": "Back in April, players of the most recent Tomb Raider noticed something surprising.
