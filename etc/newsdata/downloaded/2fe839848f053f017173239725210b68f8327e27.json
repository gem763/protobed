Many are available for lease.\n\nRick Faulk, chief executive of Wilmington, Mass.-based Locus Robotics Corp., said demand for what he calls \u201csurge robots\u201d to bolster the armies of seasonal warehouse workers has grown this year, and the company is sending more than 500 of them to its logistics and e-commerce customers.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing customers taking delivery earlier, and keeping the bots longer,\u201d Mr. Faulk said, as retailers look to the machines for help in filling online orders and restocking the shelves at their brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nFrance-based Geodis SA is boosting its robotic workforce by 75% to help workers at its U.S. warehouses fulfill fast-fashion orders during the holiday peak. This year the company, which plans to bring on between 6,000 and 7,000 human workers for the holiday period, is placing a total of 281 Locus units at five locations.\n\nXPO Logistics Inc., which is hiring 20,000 human workers for the seasonal rush, is advancing its purchase of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of robots the company expects to need next year so it can use them now to manage the spike in e-commerce orders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strategy for holiday peak that worked so well in 2018 that we\u2019ve ramped it up this year and bought 30% more,\u201d said company President Troy Cooper.\n\nThere aren\u2019t broad industry figures on the numbers of robots in logistics operations, and most warehouses still rely largely on people pulling carts\n\nor driving forklifts.\n\nBut scarcity of labor and the push for faster delivery are accelerating automation at warehouses. By 2025 about 27.6% of warehouses globally will deploy commercial robots, compared to around 3% in 2018, market advisory firm ABI Research estimates.\n\nThe companies are looking for help in the labor-intensive business of storing, sorting and packing goods for shipment, especially around the holidays, when retailers and logistics providers add tens of thousands of extra workers.\n\nDelivery giant United Parcel Service Inc. expects to hire about 100,000 seasonal employees to support the anticipated increase in package volumes from November through January 2020. FedEx Corp. plans to add more than 55,000 workers, mostly in its FedEx Ground network.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAutomation companies say most of the seasonal demand for robots comes from customers that already use their units. That can make setup a matter of minutes or hours rather than weeks for new operations.\n\n\u201cNobody is changing their operations the day before peak,\u201d said Lior Elazary, chief executive of inVia Robotics Inc., which this holiday season is supplying about 200 robots to Rakuten Super Logistics, a division of Japanese online retailer Rakuten Inc. that used 40 units during last year\u2019s peak.\n\nThe aging workforce is contributing to interest in warehouse robots, said Melonee Wise, chief executive of Fetch Robotics Inc., especially as companies look to fill gaps with temporary workers.\n\nMany seasonal warehouse workers are over 55, she said. \u201cThey have back pain and knee pain, and not everyone is up for walking.\u201d This year about 10 customers are using the company\u2019s autonomous mobile units to fulfill peak-season orders for apparel, consumer electronics and heavy appliances such as dishwashers, she said.\n\nOthers say robots aren\u2019t a universal panacea for peak-season pressure.\n\nE-commerce logistics company Radial, which counts Cole Haan Inc. and World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. among its customers, uses robotics and automation at several of its fulfillment centers but says it isn\u2019t ramping up those tools for peak. The company plans to hire more than 21,000 seasonal workers this year and says it has found scaling up the workforce is more efficient.\n\nBut with the U.S. unemployment rate at a 50-year low and businesses vying with Amazon.com Inc. and other big employers for workers, some operators hope robots can ease the hiring crunch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed this collaborative model \u2026 because we just can\u2019t find people,\u201d said Mike Honious, chief operating officer for the Americas at Geodis.\n\nA robot picks up a tote containing product at an Amazon Robotics fulfillment center .
