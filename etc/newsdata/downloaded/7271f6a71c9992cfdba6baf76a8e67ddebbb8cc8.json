one has always followed some 24 hours after the other, ever since inception of the tournament in 1987.\n\nWhat is, will be \u2026 perhaps that\u2019s the philosophical way to look at it.\n\nBesides, to what extent is the tighter time frame to the final for the Springboks at this year\u2019s World Cup really an impediment?\n\nFor one thing, professional rugby players worldwide are more than used to, by now, six-day turnarounds between certain matches, even if they are so seldom truly premier-tier fixtures like this one.\n\nIt happens in Super Rugby, and the major club competitions north of the equator, and tweaks/alterations to the lead-up regimes by the brains-trusts are duly made accordingly.\n\nAs Bok World Cup-winning lock from 1995, Kobus Wiese, mentioned in his anchoring capacity on SuperSport\u2019s SuperRugby television chat show on Monday, the week leading up to a RWC showpiece is never going to be characterised by intense physical activity in either camp - it is much more about mental and tactical preparation.\n\nThe World Cup final is the culmination of months - and even years - of diligent, dedicated pre-planning, and if teams aren\u2019t in the correct physical shape by then, a couple of days of ill-advised \u201ckoppestamp\u201d in the immediate build-up will hardly enhance readiness.\n\nThere is also just a chance, in that context, that the England players\u2019 extra day to mull over the red-letter final isn\u2019t that constructive mentally; it might be branded 24 extra hours to fret/obsess about it.\n\nIn some ways, too, the nucleus of Erasmus\u2019s Bok first team may be chomping at the bit for Saturday, rather than lamenting the compressed turnaround, considering how prudently he has deployed them in game-time terms during the event, frequently in pool play empowering an entire \u201csecond team\u201d to do the business (usually consummately) against lesser foes.\n\nIn addition, his forward-heavy benches - the area of play where there is naturally more in the way of bruising, violent contact - have ensured that key pack members have seldom fallen prey to over-play.\n\nThere is also no special pattern in RWC history of the team with the shorter turnaround playing second fiddle in the showpiece.\n\nWhile in the 2015 tournament the All Blacks won the final after an agreeably longer gap from the semi (won 20-18 against SA) than opponents Australia, in 2011 they did it the other way around: they\u2019d played the Wallabies seven days before the final, whereas beaten foes France had advantageously played Wales eight days ahead.\n\nJust as encouragingly, if the current Boks are to avoid falling into any trap of excessive consternation over the limited turnaround, the 2007 event - when they last hoisted the Webb Ellis Cup after a showpiece against Saturday\u2019s very foes England - provides a very pleasing omen.\n\nThen under the Jake White regime, they did it, you see, with the six-day turnaround (semis opponents Argentina, thumped 37-13) to the English seven, from seeing off France 14-9 \u2026\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "The unfancied Springboks\u2019 tighter lead-up to the RWC final is another impeding factor to them \u2026 but there\u2019s a good SA omen to chew on, writes <strong>Rob Houwing</strong>.", "authors": ["Comment", "Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7966/8cdc00e096ea43ca86bf33e4f091249f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
