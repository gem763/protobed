Xbox All-Access also includes a monthly subscription to the Xbox Live Gold online service for multiplayer games and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass Ultimate gives subscribers a library with more than 100 digital games on both Xbox and PC, including many of Microsoft's newest exclusive titles.\n\nMicrosoft first debuted the program in August 2018, but it sunset it a few months later at the end of 2018. Now, 10 months later, it's coming back.\n\nThe return of the Xbox All-Access program is another move to make the Xbox ecosystem more accessible for gamers of all-types. Jeff Gattis, Microsoft's General Manager of Platform and Devices Marketing, likened the all-access program to the payment plans used by cell phone carriers to help customers adopt the latest smartphones.\n\nPricing starts at $19.99 per month for the Xbox One S All Digital Edition, the disc-less console released in May. The Xbox One X, Microsoft's most powerful console, is available for $30.99 per month. The traditional Xbox One S with a disc drive is $22.99 per month. There's no interest on the monthly payments and Xbox All-Access is $100 cheaper than buying the console and paying for Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at the monthly rate.\n\nWhile the original Xbox All-Access program was limited to Microsoft Stores in the United States, Microsoft is expanding it to the United Kingdom and Australia and has formed new retail and technology partnerships in each region. The Xbox All-Access will be available through Amazon in the U.S., Clarena in the United Kingdom, and Telstra in Australia. The program's financing partner is Citizen's Bank, which has worked with Apple's iPhone upgrade program.\n\nXbox All-Access will be available in Australia on October 29, November 5 in the United Kingdom, and November 18 in the United States.", "description": "Microsoft has revived the lease-to-own Xbox All-Access program, and subscribers will be able to upgrade to Project Scarlett when its released in 2020.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db6f699dee01947ba55e14a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
