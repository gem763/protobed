(Genevieve de Manio/\u201cA Great Party: Designing the Perfect Celebration\u201d)\n\nThe Obamas\u2019 purple and chartreuse English garden-themed state dinner for the British prime minister at the time, David Cameron. A lavish wedding in a sultan\u2019s palace in Istanbul under arches of hanging wisteria. A magical Winnie the Pooh storybook ball featuring a giant beehive and hundreds of bottles of honey. Event designer Bryan Rafanelli is behind some of the most fabulous parties of the past two decades.\n\nMore than a dozen of those bashes \u2014 many with A-list clients and major budgets \u2014 are featured in his new book, \u201cA Great Party.\u201d (The introduction is by Chelsea Clinton, whose romantic wedding in Rhinebeck, N.Y., he planned.)\n\n\n\nBryan Rafanelli and his team produce events around the world. (Joel Benjamin Photography)\n\nRafanelli\u2019s new book is \u201cA Great Party: Designing the Perfect Celebration.\u201d (Rizzoli)\n\nRafanelli, who founded Rafanelli Events in 1996, has offices in Boston, New York and Palm Beach, Fla., where he and his staff produce more than 100 events a year. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about how pretty a party is,\u201d Rafanelli says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about making people feel special.\u201d\n\n[A linens expert\u2019s rules for dressing your table]\n\nMany of his parties can take a year to plan. Yet he and his longtime partner Mark Walsh got married last month in Cape Cod in a ceremony and a lunch that was planned in 30 days.\n\nOne little tidbit from the book: Michelle Obama loved the color purple, and she and Rafanelli were drawn to the 1861 Lincoln state china service, which is a reddish-purple color, but there is so little of it that curators don\u2019t let it be used for large events. Obama was hoping her own official china could be purple but discovered that apparently modern purple dyes don\u2019t work well on fine china. The Pickard China that Obama eventually selected was teal \u2014 they call it Kailua blue \u2014 inspired by the waters surrounding the president\u2019s home state.\n\n\n\nAt one of the Kids\u2019 State Dinners (really lunches) inspired by first lady Michelle Obama's \"Let's Move\" campaign, Rafanelli created vegetable topiaries made of cherry tomatoes, brussels sprouts and radishes. (Jennifer Domenick/Love Life Images/\u201cA Great Party: Designing the Perfect Celebration\u201d)\n\nRafanelli staged a number of events for the Obamas at the White House, including seven state dinners and five kids\u2019 state dinners, which featured towering topiaries of fresh vegetables. He also decorated it for the holidays twice.\n\nThough most of us can\u2019t afford to decorate with hundreds of blossoming cherry branches and black crystal candelabras, some of Rafanelli\u2019s best party tips can be adapted to just about any gathering.\n\n\n\nA Kids\u2019 State Dinner at the Obama White House featured a towering arrangement of kale, corn on the cob, eggplants, pomegranates, peppers and apples. (Jennifer Domenick/Love Life Images/\u201cA Great Party: Designing the Perfect Celebration\u201d)\n\nThrow in an element of surprise. Stage a \u201cwow\u201d moment. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean bringing in a marching band,\u201d Rafanelli says. Surprise people by removing the furniture from your living room, installing a table and having the dinner party in there. Take steps that say, \u201cLook what I took the time to do for you because you are very important to us and we wanted to make you feel special.\u201d\n\nOne of his favorite ideas for a birthday party: Put a different old photo of the person being honored under every dinner plate. When the plates come off the table, the photos spark conversation.\n\nKeep it simple for table decor. Fruits, flowers or vegetables can be arranged with style. You don\u2019t have to have a giant floral arrangement. A half-dozen small bud vases holding single stems marching down the table is an elegant and easy look. Don\u2019t overthink it; sometimes just a cluster of votive candles around the table can be enough. Vintage salt and pepper shakers are a nice touch.\n\nCreate a sense of occasion. A toast totally turns any event into a celebration. Often evenings go by without acknowledging why you\u2019ve all gathered, he says. State the reason you\u2019re there with friends or family, whether it\u2019s just to be together or to celebrate a special milestone. \u201cIf you host a party in your home, there should be an opening and a closing,\u201d he says. \u201cWelcome people after you all sit down to eat. I think it\u2019s gracious if you are getting up from the dining table to go into another room to just simply thank everyone for coming.\u201d\n\n\n\nHundreds of plastic honey bears cast a glow on the MassGeneral Hospital for Children's Storybook Ball celebrating Winnie the Pooh. (\u201cA Great Party: Designing the Perfect Celebration\u201d)\n\nEmbrace the bold statement. There is strength and power in numbers, Rafanelli says. The abundance of multiples of the same item makes an impact. In his book, there is a party where 1,000 wine bottles are lined up behind a bar and 250 vintage books form a backdrop for a book signing. Rafanelli often sends his staff to CVS or Duane Reade to see what cool items they might be inspired to incorporate into a festive setting. The 10,000 tiny red drugstore bows that decorated columns at one of the Obama White House Christmas celebrations made a strong yet inexpensive statement.\n\n\n\nGreen goblets add a splash of color and depth to the table setting at a Manhattan wedding. (\u201cA Great Party: Designing the Perfect Celebration\u201d)\n\nTrick out your glassware selection with color. Cobalt blue water glasses, pink tumblers or green goblets can do a lot to dress up your table. Everyone seems to think that, at a nice dinner, the clear crystal glasses for wine and water should all match, he says. That isn\u2019t the case. Rafanelli says he often chooses a jewel-toned glass for water at parties. Vintage wine goblets and tumblers in great colors can often be picked up inexpensively at thrift shops or flea markets.\n\n\n\nA Western-themed wedding included placecards, kraft-paper placemats and red cowbells, which guests rang during toasts. (Philip Anema/\u201cA Great Party: Designing the Perfect Celebration\u201d)\n\nDon\u2019t pooh-pooh place cards. Place cards should not just be reserved for formal affairs, Rafanelli says. You can use them to shake up the vibe of a gathering. \u201cYou are rearranging the conversation by deciding who will sit next to who,\u201d he says. \u201cPut people of different ages next to each other and it creates connectivity and conversation, and that\u2019s what a dinner party is all about.\u201d Hand-write the place cards to show how personally you are taking all the details of the gathering.", "description": "A new book offers a peek into more than a dozen A-list events, plus the event guru\u2019s best tips.", "authors": ["Jura Koncius", "Home", "Design Writer Reporting On Interiors", "Decluttering", "Organizing", "Jura Koncius Covers Interiors", "Lifestyle For The Washington Post.
