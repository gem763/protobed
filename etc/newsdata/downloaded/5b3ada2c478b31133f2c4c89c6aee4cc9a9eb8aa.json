But one of my favourite creators is uniquely capable of making me forget that what I\u2019m playing is technically still a Mario game.\n\nJapanese level creator Yuzuriha started uploading Mario Maker 2 courses to the Nintendo servers the day the game launched back in June. Their first level, Karakuri Castle, is a clever demonstration of the game\u2019s new mechanics, such as seesaws, cyclones, and icicles.\n\nIt also introduces players to some of Yuzuriha\u2019s usual tendencies, like separating levels into bite-sized chunks and crafting elaborate ending screens. It\u2019s still very much Mario, but with a few novel ideas that indicate the creator was likely experimenting with the updated tools for future concepts.\n\nYuzuriha always wants to make sure players know the level is over (Gif: Mario Maker 2 via Kotaku)\n\nThanks to Mario Maker 2 allowing players to keep tabs on their favourite creators, it\u2019s easy for me to keep track of Yuzuriha\u2019s uploads, and that\u2019s often the very first thing I do after booting up the game.\n\nI immediately added them to my queue after stumbling upon one of my favourite Mario Maker levels thus far, Mario Arcade NEO. As the name suggests, this course is a collection of mini-games meant to mimic a real-world arcade. These include a pusher, a crane game, and a rhythm game, just to name a few. Mario Arcade NEO is by far Yuzuriha\u2019s most popular level, with over 200,000 plays and 82,000 likes.\n\nThe rhythm game utilises basic Mario elements to create an entirely new experience. By locking the player between two Bullet Bill launchers and scrolling blocks above their head, Yuzuriha challenges players to keep up with the music they chose for that portion of the level. If the player misses just one, a key item won\u2019t drop at the end and they\u2019ll be asked to repeat the process to proceed.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for Mario Maker 2 players to recreate other games within the Mario framework, but Yuzuriha went above and beyond with their Mega Man level.\n\nIn addition to making an opening menu and level select, Yuzuriha managed to build ingenious replicas of the iconic boss doors and power-up cutscenes. Although there\u2019s only one boss to choose from, it\u2019s easy to see how these concepts could be expanded in the future with follow-up courses.\n\nMany Mario Maker 2 levels are all about trying to frustrate the player, but Yuzuriha went the opposite direction with De-Stress Land, which is meant to reduce fatigue from a day of work or school.\n\nDe-Stress Land utilises some oddly satisfying scenarios, from sliding down a hill and taking out a huge line of enemies to crushing a tower of ice blocks with a giant stiletto. There\u2019s always been something very calming about Mario to me, and Yuzuriha cranks up some of the most satisfying aspects of the series.\n\nYuzuriha has also tried their hand at story-based levels. Virtual Multi tasks the player with navigating through a level alongside a Koopa. Don\u2019t have any friends you can invite to a round of laggy multiplayer?\n\nThen jump into this level and cooperate with a virtual friend! There\u2019s a small twist at the end that I don\u2019t want to ruin, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a shocking turn of events after everything you and your Koopa buddy go through.\n\nNothing better than taking down Bowser with a friend, even if that friend is a Koopa (Gif: Mario Maker 2 via Kotaku)\n\nAs shown above, the section right before the end of Virtual Multi pits the player and the Koopa they\u2019ve escorted through the level against Bowser. The player can\u2019t shoot Bowser with their fiery clown car until the Koopa, who fires automatically with their own clown car, clears Munchers out of the way with POW blocks in its section of the screen.\n\nIt\u2019s not too challenging, but it\u2019s probably the most engaging portion of the level and makes great use of Mario Maker 2\u2019s artificial intelligence to mimic a co-op battle.\n\nDespite all the tools provided to creators in Mario Maker 2, even the most inventive levels still end up feeling like Mario. The franchise, with its iconic mushrooms, pipes, Goombas, and Koopas, is so ubiquitous to the gaming experience that the Mario essence becomes nearly impossible to shake. Yuzuriha, however, is among the few that craft levels with such creativity and care that it\u2019s easy to forget that they were developed within the framework of a Mario game.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to check out Yuzuriha\u2019s courses for yourself \u2014 and I highly recommend you do \u2014 their user ID is DN7-11P-JKG.
