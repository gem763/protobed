Prior to FSG, Prince founded Blackwater, a private military contractor that was mired in controversy for its actions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars -- specifically when its employees were convicted of killing unarmed civilians.\n\nFSG plans to spend approximately $15.4 (HK$120.8) million in Pakistan and Xinjiang, China by May 2020, according to a recent financial disclosure. The Trump administration announced sanctions this week against multiple Chinese entities tied to Xinjiang, citing the alleged human rights violations taking place in the region.\n\nEarlier this year, Prince told Al-Jazeera that FSG \"has zero footprint in Xinjiang, China. Period.\" However, this new financial disclosure reveals that FSG has been planning to spend millions in Xinjiang since 2018.\n\nThe recent disclosure does not specifically outline what these funds would be used for, simply stating the money is for \"setting up businesses in Pakistan and Xinjiang, China.\" Nor does the document disclose how much money has been spent in these areas to-date. A spokesperson for FSG said the company won\u2019t comment beyond what is in the financial disclosure.\n\nHowever, according to a press release signed by the company\u2019s board in Mar. 2018, FSG planned to spend the same amount ($15.4 million) to establish \"training facilities\" and buy \"security equipment and vehicles\" in Pakistan and Xinjiang. Prince told Al-Jazeera the information in this release was incorrect and that the money was for \"construction services.\"\n\nThe recent disclosure, issued by FSG\u2019s board of directors on Sept. 23, provides \"supplementary information\" to FSG\u2019s 2018 annual report, which was published in April of this year. The company\u2019s original 2018 annual report did not disclose any intended funding for projects in Pakistan or Xinjiang, China. FSG\u2019s 2019 interim report also does not disclose any such funding for Xinjiang projects.\n\nSeveral outlets reported earlier this year that FSG intended to build training centers in Xinjiang, based on another press release from the company -- which has since been removed from its website. Reuters reported in February that, according to this statement, FSG planned to invest 6 million dollars in the Xinjiang training center, which would have had the capacity to train 8,000 people a year.\n\nThat same week, a spokesman for FSG told Reuters that the statement was \"published in error by a staff member in Beijing\" and had been taken off FSG's website. A Prince spokesperson later told Reuters that Prince had no knowledge of the alleged project.\n\nAccording to company filings, FSG lends its services to companies associated with China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a $1 trillion global development strategy implemented by the Chinese government to extend its political and economic influence across Asia and into Africa and Europe. Xinjiang and countries neighboring the province, such as Pakistan, are major economic junctures for the BRI.\n\nThe Chinese government has faced international scrutiny for its actions in Xinjiang -- specifically for detaining up to a million people from its Muslim population in what human rights experts are calling \"re-education camps,\" while others call them \"internment\" or \"concentration\" camps.\n\nReports also claim that Xinjiang has become a surveillance state, with the government specially targeting the country\u2019s Muslim population.\n\nIn May of this year, a FSG spokesperson responded to questions from ABC News regarding the company\u2019s alleged plans to build training centers in Xinjiang, stating \u201cWe have no business in Xinjiang and are not building training centres there.\u201d\n\nIn an early September interview with Recoil, a firearm and lifestyle magazine, Prince reiterated that FSG was \u201cnot building a training center in Xinjiang, China,\u201d adding that the company does not provide training to any Chinese police or military.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nHowever, in 2017, FSG acquired a 25% stake in Beijing\u2019s International Security Defense College (ISDC), which claims to be the largest private security training school in China. The press release added that FSG would provide \u201cworld-class training courses\u201d to those enrolled at ISDC.\n\nOn its own website, FSG refers to ISDC as \u201cOur Facility,\u201d and offers classes to \u201cregular and reserve law enforcement officers\u201d and \u201cmilitary personnel,\u201d as stated on its enrollment form.\n\nISDC offers both military and police training, as well as \u201ctraining and security solutions\u201d for several Chinese entities, including China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and China Customs, according to ISDC\u2019s website.\n\nFSG declined to answer questions about discrepancies between Prince\u2019s statement and the company\u2019s policies on training Chinese police and military.\n\nPrince last made headlines in April when the Mueller report claimed he provided some funding for a secretive effort to obtain Hillary Clinton\u2019s private e-mails from \u201cdark web\u201d operatives. ABC News learned earlier this year that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was particularly interested in a 2017 meeting between Prince and a Russian financier with ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe Chinese government acknowledges the existence of camps located throughout its Xinjiang Province, but dubs them \"vocational centers\" -- aimed at combating \u201cextremist thoughts,\u201d according to officials who work in the centers.\n\nABC News has reported on several accounts of torture taking place within some of these facilities. The Chinese government has denied all allegations of torture within these facilities.", "description": "Prince stands to profit as his security company expands operations into a Chinese province described as a modern-day police state by human rights activists.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/erik-prince-getty-aa-191008_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
