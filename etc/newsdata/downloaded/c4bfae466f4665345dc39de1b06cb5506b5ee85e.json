Remember, the key difficulty around alternative backstop proposals has always been coming up with arrangements that respect, if not resolve a key conundrum: how to maintain trading standards and regulations the lightest of quasi-customs arrangements that are acceptable to both the EU and UK.\n\nAs ever, it\u2019s all too easy to see how even the promising progress that\u2019s emerged from reports could evaporate, as has happened in the past. Unsurprisingly, none of the key protagonists are entirely giving in to unanchored optimism.\n\nReferring to earlier in the afternoon, Ireland\u2019s Varadkar noted that the gap in agreement over customs remained \u201cquite wide\u201d\n\nThe latest talks have been \u201cconstructive\u201d, though there\u2019s more work to do, the PM Johnson\u2019s chief spokesman, James Slack noted\n\nThat anticipates the its next challenge, where any deal will have to win over the DUP, the unionist Irish party that lends conditional support to Britain\u2019s Conservative government. Johnson is said to be \u201cconfident of getting the deal through\u201d Parliament, if it can be agreed with the EU, with \u201congoing dialog\u201d between the prime minister and the DUP conveyed by his spokesman. Under the circumstances, the EU\u2019s informal midnight deadline for deciding whether a viable deal is in the offing might be allowed to slip somewhat. Markets in their current state of excited anticipation would probably react favourably.\n\nTuesday\u2019s key market reactions so far\n\nShares extended gains across the EU, though the Irelands ISEQ All-Share rose most, with a 2.5% rise\n\nThe laden with groups dependent on the UK for most of their revenue tacked on 1.3%\n\nThe rose more than 1% to its highest since August 2018; the broad reached its best levels since May 2018\n\nEven the threatened to erase small losses in favour of small gains. sterling gains due to the drag on its global exporter shares\u2019 revenues\n\nFX markets have expressed resurgent optimism via both the pound and the euro. Sterling has advanced as much as 0.8%, with the single currency getting as high as 0.5% off lows\n\nClearly, the market reaction itself puts even more at stake should talks look like they might falter. Even if the deal gets across the line in Brussels it will then face a Parliamentary vote, after MPs voted down former Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, before defeating Boris Johnson many more times. For sterling in particular, perhaps Wednesday\u2019s inflation figures may turn out to be the least of its problems, regardless of how far away they are from expectations. Overall, the pound is no less volatile this week. Short-term volatility indicators have risen for four straight sessions\n\nOn the charts, the pound has pierced its closely watched 200-day moving average for the first time since late April. However a key level we have been watching as a gauge of how convinced sterling buyers really are\u2014$1.278, a failure high from June, has been tested though not sustainably breached. Like deal prospects, sterling\u2019s chances of a lasting recovery are buoyed, though still quite in the balance.\n\n\u2013 daily [15/10/2019 17:09:44]\n\nGBP/USD \u2013 daily [15/10/2019 17:09:44]\n\nDisclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
