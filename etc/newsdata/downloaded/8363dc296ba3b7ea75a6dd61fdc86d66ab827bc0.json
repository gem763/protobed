When it comes to 14-year-old Jackson Oswalt, his time is spent in a laboratory working on a nuclear fusion reactor.\n\nThe Memphis teen finished his reactor and achieved fusion at the age of 13. He\u2019s regarded by experts as the youngest in America \u2013 maybe even the world \u2013 to accomplish it. Jackson built a steel machine made up of vacuums, pumps and chambers that is capable of smashing atoms together through force in a smoking hot plasma center that releases a burst of fusion energy. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how the sun and other stars are powered, the process within Jackson\u2019s nuclear fusion reactor is comparable.\n\nHe began working on the fusion reactor at 12 years old, after concluding that he didn\u2019t want to dedicate his leisure time solely to playing games like Fortnite. He began scouring the Internet for nuclear-related things because that\u2019s what he says held his interest. Yes \u2014 at 12 years old.\n\nDuring his research, Jackson came across Taylor Wilson, who in 2008 at 14 years old garnered international recognition as the youngest person to achieve fusion after building a nuclear fusion reactor in his parents\u2019 garage in Texarkana, Ark.\n\nJackson, like any 12-year-old would, thought he could at least try to beat the record set by Wilson. From there he got to work.\n\n\u201cThe start of the process was just learning about what other people had done with their fusion reactors,\u201d explained the mild-mannered teen. \u201cAfter that, I assembled a list of parts I needed. [I] got those parts off eBay primarily and then often times the parts that I managed to scrounge off of eBay weren\u2019t exactly what I needed. So, I\u2019d have to modify them to be able to do what I needed to do for my project.\u201d\n\nSCIENTISTS SAY THE DREAM OF UNLIMITED CLEAN ENERGY IS ABOUT TO COME TRUE\n\nBuilding the nuclear fusion reactor was no game for Jackson. He converted an old playroom in his Memphis home into a functioning lab. With the financial support of his parents \u2013 he spent between $8,000 and $10,000 over the course of a year collecting the parts he needed to build his nuclear fusion reactor \u2013 that was apparently the easy part.\n\nPutting the fusion reactor together and testing to see if it worked was the real challenge. Since there isn\u2019t exactly a manual on how to build something like that he relied on trial and error and the Open Source Fusor Research Consortium, an online forum for amateur physicists, to ensure that he was taking the proper steps toward successfully building a fusion reactor and hopefully achieving fusion.\n\n\u201cAfter a while, it became pretty simple to realize how it all worked together, but at the start it was definitely figuring out one aspect of it, memorizing what that actually meant and then moving on to a different aspect of it,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cEventually all those pieces of the puzzle came together to make a good project.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJackson\u2019s father, Chris Oswalt, had no real understanding of what his son was working on. To make sure Jackson was safe he had experts speak to him about the dangers involved with working on a potentially deadly fusion reactor, like being exposed to high levels of radiation or being electrocuted by the 50,000 volts of electricity he uses to warm the fusion reactor\u2019s plasma core.\n\nOutside of his safety concerns, Chris Oswalt was astonished at what his son was attempting to do.\n\n\u201cBeing a parent of someone that was as driven as he was for 12 months was really impressive to see. I mean it was everyday grinding; Everyday learning something different; everyday failing and watching him work through all those things,\u201d he said.\n\nThroughout the process, Jackson posted his results to the Open Source Fusor Research Consortium up until the point when he was able to achieve fusion on Jan. 19, 2018 \u2014 hours before his 13th birthday. In Jackson\u2019s case that meant combining two atoms of deuterium gas in the fusion reactor\u2019s plasma core which ejected a neutron into a device that slowed it down and detected nuclear fusion.\n\n\u201cYou have to jump through the right hoops, and we have to believe you and see what you\u2019ve done,\u201d said Richard Hull, 72, a verifier with the research consortium and an administrator for its website Fusor.net.\n\nHull, a retired electronics engineer from Richmond, Va., verified both Jackson\u2019s and Wilson\u2019s results. He now regards Jackson as the youngest in America \u2013 possibly the world \u2013 to achieve fusion.\n\nTHE NUCLEAR BATTLE BETWEEN THE EARTH AND SUN\n\nOn a larger scale, scientists have yet to figure out how to produce a nuclear fusion reactor that, like the sun, is able to release more energy than it takes in to power things like homes and buildings.\n\n\u201cWe are still far away from making a working nuclear fusion reactor to produce electricity so you can think about how challenging it is to make a fusion reactor,\u201d said Dr. Jingbiao Cui, professor and chair of the Physics department at the University of Memphis.\n\nWith a young mind like Jackson interested in becoming a \u201cnuclear engineer working on more projects like this,\u201d scientists could work out the kinks of fusion reactors sooner rather than later.", "description": "Some kids spend their time on social media.
