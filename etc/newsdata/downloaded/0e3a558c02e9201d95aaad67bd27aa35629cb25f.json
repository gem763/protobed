If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of great reasons to install a dash cam in your vehicle: providing video evidence of a car accident, bearing witness to your ride getting backed into or doored in a busy parking lot, or snagging footage of your next cross-country road trip, to name a few. After weeks of research and driving 2,230 miles from the Mexican border to Calgary, Canada\u2014recording dash cam footage all along the way\u2014we can tell you that the best dash cam is the Garmin 65W (available at Amazon for $189.99). It\u2019s a feature-packed, easy-to-use device that provided us with high resolution, wide-angle footage of our journey and offers more useful features than any driver could ever hope for.\n\nThat said, the Garmin 65W is pretty expensive. If you\u2019re interested in a basic dash cam that\u2019ll capture footage adequate for insurance reporting purposes, you\u2019ll want to consider the inexpensive CrossTour CR300 (available at Amazon for $37.99).\n\n1. Best Overall: Garmin Dash Cam 65W\n\nGarmin Dash Cam 65W (Photo: Reviewed / S\u00e9amus Bellamy)\n\nWere you to sum up what makes the Garmin Dash Cam 65W such a great device, it would be competency and scalability. The 180-degree field of view afforded by its wide-angle lens and its capacity to capture beautifully clear 1080p video footage at a smooth 30 frames per second makes it a fine choice for anyone looking to secure time-and-GPS-location-stamped footage to back up an insurance claim, help themselves to get out of a traffic ticket, or capture all of the beautiful moments of a cross country road trip.\n\nWhen compared against the photographic hardware now jammed into smartphones, the Garmin's 2.1-megapixel camera might not sound like much. But we found the footage that it captured during the day, at night, or even in the middle of a freak rainstorm, to be consistently viewable. It\u2019s even capable of taking still photos. In order to ensure constant recording as you drive, Garmin designed their dash cam to automatically record over the oldest footage stored on its included 8GB microSD card (if you want to keep a record of your entire trip, the 65W can accept higher capacity microSD cards, up to 64GB in size). Recording over older footage, in this fashion, ensures that your camera will always has space in its memory to record an important incident. That said, if the Garmin 65W\u2019s accelerometer detects what it perceives as a crash or the sudden deceleration of your vehicle, loop recording will stop, and instead save the current, last and next recordings that it captures, in order to ensure that footage of a potential incident is secured. Footage can be reviewed either on the 65W\u2019s three-inch color display, using Garmin\u2019s free VIRB smartphone app, or by shuttling the video files off of the 65W\u2019s memory card to your computer.\n\nThe Garmin 65W comes packing the best user interface of any of the devices we tested. Four analog buttons run up the right-hand side of the device, allowing you to navigate the various function menus and options via a series of on-screen prompts. Want to keep both hands on the wheel? No problem: many of the camera\u2019s functions can be controlled with your voice. I spouted requests for the Garmin to take photos, start a time-lapse video of our drive or to start recording audio of my wife and I bantering back and forth at each other, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my commands were acted upon, without error.\n\nThis dash camera comes packed with a number of desirable options that can augment your daily commute or a cross country trip. A driver alertness alarm can be set on the 65W to occasionally make sure that you\u2019re not drifting off behind the wheel on long treks. Collision avoidance and lane departure alarms will help you to keep on top of what the drivers sharing the road with you are doing. My favorite feature of the bunch is Garmin\u2019s \u2018Go\u2019 alert: when stopped at a red light, the camera will notify you, via audio, that the traffic in front of you is on the move again. For those who prefer to drive distraction-free, all of these perks can also be switched off, leaving the 65W to act as a silent co-pilot on your journeys.\n\nThe camera\u2019s design also lends itself to providing you with distraction-free wheel-time as well: It takes up so little space on your windshield that you\u2019re bound to forget that it's even there. The Garmin 65W comes with a ball and socket mounting arm that mates to your windshield with a magnet-and-sticker mount. Two mounts are included, making it easy to switch out the Garmin 65W between two different vehicles. During testing, we found that, through five days of highway driving and hours of wheeling through backroads, the camera didn\u2019t budge from where we pointed it.\n\nThe Garmin 65W can be powered via USB or a 12-volt car charger (included with the camera). Even when disconnected from a power source, Garmin\u2019s got your back: The 65W comes packing a battery backup that can provide the device with 30 minutes of power.\n\nGet the Garmin Dash Cam 65W from Amazon for $189.99\n\n2. Best Value: Crosstour CR300\n\nCrosstour CR300 (Photo: Reviewed / S\u00e9amus Bellamy)\n\nThe CrossTour CR300 lacks the bells and whistles of many of the other dash cams we tested, but for the money, you won\u2019t find a more dependable device. Unlike our best overall pick, the CR300 attaches to your windshield with a suction cup, making it easy to stow away or move to a different vehicle. During a week\u2019s worth of testing, the suction cup only failed once when I went to push one of the camera\u2019s physical buttons to change a setting. The ball-and-socket assembly that attaches the CR300 to its suction cup mount proved tight enough that I didn\u2019t have to adjust it, even after days of subjecting it to near-constant road vibration.\n\nWhile the CR300\u2019s 1080p video quality can\u2019t match the visual fidelity of the footage captured by the Garmin 65W, video captured during the day proved clear enough to use for insurance purposes. Despite not being nearly as crisp when shooting in low light conditions, I could still see everything within range of my ERV\u2019s headlights with very few digital artifacts in darker areas of the recording. In other words, what it continuously records is likely good enough, for most people. You should know that the plastic housing on this camera feels flimsy: I\u2019m concerned that it could easily be damaged if it was dropped the wrong way. However, provided you make sure to check its suction cup from time to time and treat it gingerly when pushing any of its buttons, you should be OK.\n\nAnd hey, if it does break, it\u2019s inexpensive enough that purchasing another one is no big deal.\n\nGet the Crosstour CR300 from Amazon for $37.99\n\n3. Nextbase 522GW\n\nNextbase 522GW (Photo: Nextbase Dash)\n\nI have a lot of kind things to say about the Nextbase 522GW dash cam. It\u2019s a well-made, handsome looking piece of hardware. Its suction cup mount adhered to our windshield and kept the camera in place throughout our five-day journey north. As with the Garmin 65W, I found that I didn\u2019t have to adjust its orientation to compensate for road vibration. The wide-angle 1440p HD/30fps that the 522GW shot looked great (as full HD should). The 522GW doesn\u2019t offer the same area of coverage as the Garmin 65W does. However, what this dash cam did capture was recorded in fabulous detail. It could be a great choice, not only for keeping a record of your no doubt careful, conscientious driving habits, but also for anyone interested in logging their travels for use on YouTube or a travel blog.\n\nUnfortunately, there were a number of problems with this device that kept me from giving it top marks. For starters, for a dash cam it\u2019s huge: about the size of a compact point-and-shoot camera. The more real estate taken up by anything on your windshield, the less of the road in front of you you\u2019re bound to see while driving. The Garmin 65W is significantly smaller and more capable. While this device\u2019s generously sized display was crisp and easy on the eyes, I found that its touch interface wasn\u2019t always responsive. On several occasions, I found myself stabbing at the 522GW\u2019s screen a number of times in order to get it to carry out a command. This frustration was piled on top of the fact that the camera\u2019s user interface isn\u2019t as user-friendly as I\u2019d like it to have been. While I eventually learned my way around, I\u2019d recommend that buyers of this dash cam spend some time playing with it before they mount it in their vehicle. Nextbase\u2019s iOS app (also available for Android) felt just as unintuitive to use as its on-device counterpart\u2014when I was able to get it to connect to the camera at all. While trying to link the app to the 522GW via Wi-Fi, I was repeatedly rewarded with connection errors. This dash cam does not come equipped with parking mode\u2014which captures any physical movement near your car while parked\u2014while other Nextbase models do.\n\nGet the Nextbase 522GW from BestBuy for $209.99\n\n4. Anker Roav DashCam S1\n\nAnker Roav DashCam S1 (Photo: Roav)\n\nI loved the design of this feature-packed, high-resolution camera when I first unboxed it. Unlike the other cameras in this roundup, which dangle from a mount attached to your windshield, the ROAV\u2019s sleek, flat body hugs up flush against your vehicle\u2019s windshield glass. It looks great! Sadly, I quickly discovered that the design has a serious flaw: while the camera\u2019s lens can be tilted up or down, the ROAV\u2019s design doesn\u2019t allow for side-to-side articulation. This means that once the dash cam\u2019s backplate is fixed to your windshield, what you see is what you get. If it\u2019s crooked or your car isn\u2019t framed quite to your liking, too bad. The camera does come with two mounting plates, so you could have a second chance at lining it up correctly\u2014provided you\u2019re not planning on using the camera in more than one vehicle. There is an upside to this design, however: During testing, I never had to worry about the ROAV moving due to road vibration.\n\nI found that the ROAV\u2019s capacitive touch controls were hard to landmark and use unless I was giving the device my undivided attention. However, despite an initially rocky setup period, Anker\u2019s companion iOS app for reviewing your ROAV camera\u2019s footage is well designed and a pleasure to use.\n\nGet the Anker Roav DashCam S1 from Amazon for $95.99\n\n5. Magellan MiVue 420\n\nMagellan MiVue 420 (Photo: Magellan)\n\nFor years, Magellan was one of the biggest names of in-car navigation. While the company has largely shifted its focus to providing navigation and built-in GPS-tracking hardware for commercial transport vehicles, they still offer a few devices aimed at general consumers. The Magellan MiVue 420 is an example of this. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not a good example.\n\nThe MiVue 420 offers a relatively broad 140-degree field of view and captures 1296p video at 30 frames per second. When reviewing the footage for the MiVue 420, I found that the video stuttered on a regular basis. Despite this, the action captured, no matter the lighting conditions, was still quite viewable. Unfortunately, this dash cam had enough unforgivable deficiencies that I had no choice but to give it poor marks early on during testing.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about its mounting system. The MiVue 420 uses a suction cup in order to adhere to the window of your vehicle. Unfortunately, whether it was due to the south Texas heat, the vibration of traveling up the Interstate or the chilled air we enjoyed once we\u2019d driven far enough north, the suction cup refused to stay stuck to our windshield. Having it fall off, potentially into your footwell while you\u2019re driving, could cause an accident. When the suction cup did stay in place, I found that the ball and socket assembly of the arm that the 420 hung on needed frequent adjustment.\n\nI wasn\u2019t thrilled with the dash cam\u2019s display either: No matter what lighting conditions I viewed it in, the display always looked washed out. Finally, the 420 comes packing impact avoidance functionality\u2014when a vehicle in the camera\u2019s view gets too close to your car or truck, an alarm will sound. I ended up having to turn it off because every time we stopped at an intersection with a vehicle in front of us, the alarm would sound, even while we idled a car\u2019s length away. It was more of an irritant than a help.\n\nGet the Magellan MiVue 420 from Amazon for $116.92\n\n6. Aukey DR01\n\nAukey DR01 (Photo: Aukey)\n\nThe Aukey DR01 is an inexpensive dash cam that captures 1080p video with a wide, 170-degree field of view. The quality of footage you\u2019ll get from this device is middling, at best, but it should be adequate for insurance reporting under most circumstances. That said, we\u2019re unable to recommend it for a number of reasons.\n\nDuring testing, we found that the DR01 refused to remain in place in the face of road vibration: its flimsy plastic mount wasn\u2019t up to the job of securing in position. I had to readjust the camera\u2019s orientation at least once every hour. This issue wasn\u2019t helped along by the fact that all of the physical interface buttons for the camera are located along the bottom edge of the DR01\u2019s fuzzy-looking two-inch display. Pushing one of the buttons, without using my other hand to hold the device in place, resulted in the camera tipping upwards without fail.\n\nGet the Aukey DR01 from Amazon for $59.99\n\nHow We Tested\n\nWe drove from south Texas to the Canadian Rocky Mountains, testing dash cams along the way. (Photo: Reviewed / S\u00e9amus Bellamy)\n\nThe Tester\n\nMy name\u2019s Seamus Bellamy. I\u2019m Reviewed\u2019s Updates Editor and, handily for this guide, a full-time nomad. For the past four years, my wife and I have lived full-time in a 40-foot long motorhome, migrating between Canada, Texas, Mexico and back again in an effort to never see a flake of snow, ever again. It\u2019s not a lifestyle for everyone, but we love it. Given my decade-long career as a tech journalist and editor, along with the amount of time that I spend on the road, I\u2019m arguably one of the best individuals you could ever hope to find to test a product like dash cams.\n\nThe Tests\n\nEntering the term \u201cdash cam\u201d in the search field of an online shopping site will land you thousands of results\u2014that\u2019s more cameras than I could hope to test in a lifetime. Before I could begin to fathom what to test, I had to narrow this field of hardware down considerably. So, I decided to keep things simple.\n\nWhile there are dash cams that can monitor both the interior and exterior of your vehicle and camera systems designed to what\u2019s in front of and behind your car, I decided to focus only on models that take forward-facing footage for several reasons. They\u2019re easy enough to install that most people can do it themselves; they present less of an intrusion into the privacy of you and your passengers than devices with an inward-facing cameras can, and despite offering more video coverage of your vehicle, a forward-facing dash cam can still do its primary job well\u2014capturing footage of any accident that you\u2019re involved in. Next, having narrowed the field, I turned to a number of trusted online sources, such as Tom\u2019s Guide, The Wirecutter, and New York Magazine to see what my colleagues had to say on the subject. A number of brands and devices kept coming up in their research\u2014for better or worse. I took note of what writers at other publications liked and which dash cams they felt that folks should avoid. From here, I collected 10 of the top picks from my list of trusted websites and winnowed my group of dash cams down even further, leveraging user reviews, price and whether or not the dash cam in question was old enough that it might be replaced by a new model in the near future, as metrics. In the end, I was left with six different dash cams to test.\n\nYou couldn't ask for a better platform for testing dash cams with than this house and test lab on wheels. (Photo: Reviewed / S\u00e9amus Bellamy)\n\nIn order to test these six contenders, I set them up in the huge front window of our class A motorhome: a 40-foot long, 2004 Newmar KountryStar diesel pusher. As my wife wheeled our rig out of McAllen, Texas to start on the 2230 mile trek to Calgary Canada, I turned the cameras on and started testing. During our five-day drive, I looked for the following:\n\nHow easy it was to mount and remove the camera from my windshield\n\nWhether the cameras would remain attached to the windshield for the duration of the trip\n\nWhether road vibration would shift the focus of the cameras away from the points that I had fixed them upon\n\nThe quality of video captured during the day and in low-light driving conditions\n\nWhether the camera recorded parking security footage while our vehicle was not in motion\n\nThe visibility of the camera\u2019s display in all lighting conditions\n\nHow easy it is to review footage on the camera itself or, where applicable with a smartphone app or on a laptop\n\nSome of the cameras in my test group came packing useful extras such as proximity alerts to warn of an impending collision, a driver alert system that randomly beeps loudly to keep one from nodding off behind the wheel, or lane departure warnings. For the right drivers, these tools could be incredibly useful\u2014but they have the potential to be huge distractions or cause unneeded stress, too. Where such features existed, I made sure that they could easily be turned off. Along these same lines, as distracted driving has shown to be just as effective a killer as driving while intoxicated, I rated each dash cam on how well it faded into the background. I awarded higher marks to devices with easy-to-use user interfaces; that needed to be physically adjusted less often. If I forgot that it was even there until it was time to review my video footage, I considered it a win.\n\nFinally, after reviewing all six dash cams together, I did a second round of objective testing on my top performers, just to be sure that I hadn\u2019t missed anything. For this second round of tests, the finalists were mounted in my Jeep and taken on a four-hour drive.\n\nWhat You Should Know About Dash Cams\n\nIs a dash cam right for you? It's not necessarily a simple question. Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhy Own a Dash Cam?\n\nThe most obvious reason to invest in a dash cam is that it acts as an impartial witness to your travels. If you're involved in a car accident that wasn't your fault, having this kind of video footage that proves you weren't to blame could keep your insurance rates from rising, save you thousands of dollars in the event of a civil suit, or possibly even keep you out of jail.\n\nDepending on the model of dash cam you buy, the hardware may be capable of monitoring your vehicle while it's parked, too. So, should someone back their mini-van into your car while you're in the grocery store picking up some milk, you'll have a record of what happened, waiting for you when you come out.\n\nFinally, if you love creating videos of your travels to share online, a high-definition dash cam is a great way to record a road trip. Some, like the Garmin 65W, even come packing the ability to create time-lapse videos of your journey.\n\nWhat About Rear-Facing Cameras?\n\nIt's possible to get your hands on dash cams that come with a secondary camera that peers in on you and your passengers, as well as ones that come in a kit with a second camera that's designed to be mounted in your vehicle's rear end. If you're looking for the best rear camera, we may address these devices in their own guide at a later date. However, for simplicity's sake, we wanted to stick to forward-facing cameras for this guide.\n\nA forward-facing dash cam can be installed in minutes, by just about anyone. That's not the case with camera systems designed to cover both the front and the rear end of a vehicle. Installing an aftermarket back-facing camera often requires a higher level of technical skill than many folks have, or may necessitate a trip to a specialist to have it installed correctly. We prefer not to recommend products that people can't pick up and start using on their own, right out of the box. What's more, chances are, a forward-facing camera will be all you need to cover your bases, from an insurance point of view.\n\nWhile a forward-facing camera won't collect footage of a car slamming into you from behind, many dash cams now come with features like GPS logging and accelerometers. This makes it possible to record your vehicle\u2019s speed of travel and, in many cases, register an impact. With the other evidence collected during a police or insurance investigation, if you weren\u2019t to blame for an accident, the video your dashcam captured could be enough to get you off the hook.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
