Lysette tells EW Scafaria\u2019s script \u2014 about a band of club employees who band together to scam money out of their Wall Street clientele \u2014 spoke to her experience as a survival sex worker dancing for tips at a New York City club prior to her Hollywood debut. Below, the star opens up about how her past as an exotic dancer informed her role in Hustlers, how a single tweet landed her the gig, and the importance of trans visibility (as well as the fact that the gender identity of her character, Tracey, is never discussed in the film) in mainstream movies. As told to Joey Nolfi.\n\nMotion Picture Artwork \u00a9 2019 STX Financing, LLC. All Rights Reserved More\n\nI danced at Scores on and off for over eight years, during the time that the movie is set, and it was too close to home to only take the proper Hollywood channels. I told my agent, but I was so excited that I blurted on Twitter that I used to work there, and I wanted to help, whether that meant as a consultant or somehow getting a part. I wasn\u2019t quite sure; I was just happy that this story was finally getting told, because I know so many courageous women who stripped \u2014 some of the most amazing women I\u2019ve ever met in my life were strippers while raising kids or going to school. They\u2019re hustlers through and through.\n\nThis is such a redemptive story, because we\u2019ve revered powerful, wealthy men throughout film history, so I was ecstatic about seeing that flipped on its head and seeing that through a woman\u2019s lens. It shows strippers and women who work in strip clubs from a different point of view, because usually when there\u2019s a stripper or sex worker on TV or in film, it\u2019s usually in passing, and they\u2019re usually the aide to whatever male lead or character. But, this is the opposite. It\u2019s from the point of view of the dancers, and I love that.\n\nLorene Scafaria ended up seeing my tweet, and we went to lunch. I told her a bunch of old stories about working there and crazy things that happened. She ended up writing me a role! We didn\u2019t discuss [the character\u2019s gender] at all, and I think that\u2019s fine, because when I worked in the club, I didn\u2019t discuss it at all in real life. The character isn\u2019t specifically trans, so it\u2019s up to the audience to determine whatever they want about Tracey. She\u2019s a woman getting her money and juggling her insecure boyfriend, the perils of that kind of life, and the financial crash and what that did to the cash flow.\n\nFor me, as a trans woman, dancing was deeply affirming, because I didn\u2019t disclose my business to anyone (except for a select few confidantes) when I was dancing. It kind of validated my womanhood in a way at that time when I was a youngster. Over the years, I grew not only as a woman, but intellectually, and understood that we were there to make money, but also as a toy for these rich, powerful men. It took a minute for that to set in for me. It\u2019s that duality that you juggle in that line of work, and you have to keep your wits about you and remain in your power at all times, because it\u2019s a slippery slope. I\u2019d never suggest anyone go into a line of work unless they felt like they could handle it and probably have no other options. For me, I had no other options. It was about survival. The circumstances in my life led me there and I made the most of it. It\u2019s important to talk about Tracey\u2019s identity, but it\u2019s also important to give the audience their own takeaway. I\u2019ve played non-trans-specific roles and I\u2019ve played outwardly trans roles, so I welcome something like this, where it\u2019s not the focal point of the character. But, I\u2019m a well-known trans actor, so I suspect if people watching don\u2019t know me, they\u2019ll look me up and say, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know! Maybe I know someone who\u2019s trans now, through a movie!\u201d", "description": "Hustlers star Trace Lysette on trans visibility", "authors": ["Joey Nolfi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NI5GUhBBJcC5xev5heE6LQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/68b427b707147b9147f8cd433de11501", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
