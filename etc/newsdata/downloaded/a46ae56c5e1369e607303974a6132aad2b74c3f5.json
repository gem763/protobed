The babies contained in the goo usually don't hatch until the mass reaches about 500 feet.\n\nIn 2015, divers off the coast of Turkey captured their own video of a similar floater which they hypothesized was created by red flying squid.\n\nA massive blob (pictured above) was found floating in the fjord by researchers from Norway's Research Expedition Vessel which helps monitor ocean health\n\nThe orb was a massive 13-feet wide and contained millions of squid eggs according to National Geographic, who highlighted the find at the time.\n\nResearchers aren't sure how exactly the orbs grow to be so large, but have posited that the jelly likely starts out much smaller and grows as more eggs are deposited.\n\nThe gel is thought to protect the nascent squid from bacteria and infections and researchers have noted that attempts to grow squids in a lab setting without the gooey formation have been plagued with disease.\n\nSince 2015, scientists have only witnessed a handful of the blobs in the wild and there are only a few published examples on record.", "description": "The phenomenon is a rare find for marine biologists since the egg sacs are rarely found beyond the bounds of the deep sea and usually only last for several days before dissipating into the ocean.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/20/19456884-0-image-a-4_1570561321647.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
