Not only do we know we've done nothing wrong, but we've got a ton of hard evidence and a bunch of corroborating witnesses that proves it.'\n\nHe goes on to say 'when all is said and done we trust in God' before citing a bible verse and concluding the long post.\n\nBack in August, news broke that the couple were set to be arrested by the United States Marshall as warrants were issued.\n\nA federal court official had issued two warrants for the arrest of the reality stars according to court documents obtained by The Blast at the time.\n\nOuch: Todd and wife Julie face 12 counts of fraud and tax evasion including faking financial documents to obtain million dollars in loans\n\nThe publication reports the warrants were issued and received by the US Marshal, as they have been ordered to take the reality stars into custody immediately.\n\nThe couple, along with their Roswell, Georgia-based accountant Peter Tarantino, 56, were named as defendants in papers filed this afternoon with the US District Court of Northern Georgia.\n\nIn the 12-count indictment, the Chrisleys are accused of bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud conspiracy and tax evasion.\n\nTarantino is accused with them of conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts of aiding the filing of a false tax return.\n\nIf convicted Todd and Julie could face up to 30 years in prison, according to federal guidelines\n\nThe main evidence comes from emails Todd Chrisley sent to a business partner in his Georgia-based company Chrisley Asset Management (CAM) asking to falsify financial documents.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2012, CAM managed and sold foreclosed properties.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Chrisley tricked banks into giving him and his wife large loans by convincing them they were personally worth millions.\n\nIt states the Chrisleys and their unidentified business partner, only named in papers as Co-conspirator A 'conspired to submit false materials, such as fabricated bank statements and false personal financial statements, to financial institutions to obtain millions of dollars in loans, much of which they used for their own personal benefit.'\n\nA grand jury at the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia Atlanta Division also accuses their accountant Peter Tarantino of falsifying tax returns\n\nThe lawsuit gave an example, from November 5, 2007, how the trio tricked a bank into believing the Chrisleys had $4 million in an account with financial institution Merrill Lynch to obtain a loan.\n\nThe suit states, 'When the bank employee requested account statements, Co-conspirator A sent Todd Chrisley and Julie Chrisley a fabricated bank statement showing that Todd and Julie Chrisley had $776,509.52 on deposit at Merrill Lynch.\n\n'In response, Todd Chrisley told Co-conspirator A, 'you are a f****** genious [sic]!!!
