Yes I'm being judgmental, I had kids and I like to shop and eat without having to put up with kids like yours.\"\n\nAnother wrote, \"Children are a product of their environment so how you've raised them to behave is how they will behave.\"\n\nHewitt told \"GMA\" the negative comments won't change the way she parents.\n\n\"This is who I am, an honest person who doesn\u2019t sugarcoat everything,\" she said. \"If telling my kids I love them but they are annoying me is the worst thing I ever say to our girls, then I think I\u2019ve won motherhood.\"\n\nAlexandra Sacks, M.D., a reproductive psychiatrist and the host of the Gimlet Media podcast Motherhood Sessions told \"GMA,\" \"Asking another mom if and how you might be able to help is much more supportive than critically commenting from the sidelines. And, unless you're worried about safety, it generally is viewed as intrusive to comment on the behavior of strangers or even acquaintances in public settings. Trust that if someone wants your input they can always ask for your advice.\"\n\nSo what do the experts say? Is it OK to call your kids annoying?\n\nFirst, there's a big difference between telling your kids they are annoying and telling them their behavior is annoying, said Dr. Stephanie Samar, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute.\n\n\"Telling your child that their behavior is annoying will not cause long-term issues,\" she told \"GMA.\"\n\n\"With that said, it is important to distinguish between evaluating behavior and evaluating the whole person when providing feedback \u2013 saying 'this behavior is annoying to me' can be constructive while saying 'you are annoying' is not and leads to all or nothing thoughts like 'I did a bad thing which means I\u2019m bad'. Providing corrective feedback is an incredibly important parenting tool; however for it to be effective you need to notice and provide feedback on what your child is doing well.\"\n\nFor example, she said, try catching them the 30 seconds between bickering among siblings to say \u201cI love how quiet you both are being.\u201d\n\nSamar also suggested parents look at where their own frustration is coming from.\n\n\"If you find your child is 'annoying' all of the time, that could mean you are burnt-out,\" she said. If that's the case, it's time to find time for self-care.\n\nOne thing both experts and Hewitt agree on is that judging parents isn't helpful.\n\n\"Parenthood is hard enough. Most moms are so tough on themselves, they may not have the bandwidth to productively use outside unsolicited advice from others,\" said Sacks. \"Before you judge another parent because you think you know better, remind yourself that there's no way to know what any other family's circumstances and emotional experience are, even if it looks like yours from the outside.\"\n\nSamar told \"GMA\" that judgmental comments usually have the opposite of the intended effect.\n\n\"Judgments often leave parents feeling unsupported and misunderstood which then gets in the way of them being effective parents,\" she said. \"If we want to help each other be better parents then offering support or validation is more likely to lead to 'better' parenting than criticism.\"\n\nHewitt hopes that parents who have been in a similar situation to the one she found herself in at the grocery store will feel encouraged by her post.\n\n\"I want people to know that it\u2019s OK to not love every single part of motherhood,\" she said. \"It\u2019s OK to not be the perfect parent. You can be angry at your kids and love them at the same time. There is no one-size-fits-all kind of parenting, we all are walking life in different shoes, on different paths to different destinations. What works for me may not work for you, and that\u2019s OK. Let\u2019s offer more kindness and less judgment to parents.\"\n\n\"And also,\" she added, \"it would be great if grocery stores could offer daycare like at the gym.\"", "description": "Kristen Hewitt's Facebook post has been shared almost 30,000 times.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190910kristenhewittmain_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
