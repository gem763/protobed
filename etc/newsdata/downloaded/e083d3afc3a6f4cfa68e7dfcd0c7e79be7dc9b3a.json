A leftist bloc garnered 11.9% of votes in the poll.\n\n\u201cWe have victory,\u201d jubilant PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told party members at the party\u2019s headquarters in central Warsaw.\n\nOpposition groups and Poland\u2019s EU partners say that during its four years in power, PiS has undermined the independence of the judiciary, forced public media to promote its agenda and taken other steps to quell dissent.\n\nThe party has cast the election as a choice between a society rooted in traditional Catholic values and a liberal order that promotes a chosen few and undermines family life.\n\nCritics accused it of fomenting homophobia during the election campaign, with PiS officials calling lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights an invasive foreign influence that threatens Poland\u2019s national identity.\n\nThe EU has launched unprecedented legal action against PiS over its justice reforms, which PiS says are needed to make courts more efficient and fair.\n\nUnder Poland\u2019s complex election rules, PiS\u2019 result from Sunday\u2019s exit poll would translate into 239 seats in the 460-member lower house of parliament, calculations by private broadcaster TVN showed.\n\nElection officials are expected to start announcing partial results on Monday.\n\nDIVIDED SOCIETY\n\nPiS has drawn support from poorer Poles who feel they have missed out on prosperity since the collapse of communism in 1989. The party has mixed nationalist rhetoric with a vast welfare programme financed by an economic boom.\n\nIt has depended on close links with Poland\u2019s dominant Catholic Church, with senior officials frequently attending religious ceremonies and events, and the party has espoused stronger religious values in public life.\n\nPoland's ruling party Law and Justice (PiS) leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski waves after the exit poll results are announced in Warsaw, Poland, October 13, 2019.
