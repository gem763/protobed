Companies like Starsky Robotics hope they can address the shortage by making the jobs less taxing.\n\n\"The problem is there aren't enough people willing to spend a month at a time in a truck.\"\n\n\u2014 Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starsky co-founder\n\nTo make the job more appealing, self-driving truck start-up TuSimple even helped create an autonomous driving certificate program at Tucson's Pima Community College to teach truck drivers how to train, operate and monitor autonomous truck systems closer to home.\n\nInstead of aiming for an AV moonshot \u2014 an autonomous truck that makes all the driving decisions without any human intervention \u2014 Starsky says it's taking a more practical approach that combines highway automation with teleoperation, allowing remote drivers to navigate trucks between distribution centers and the highway.\n\nDetails: With no one inside, the Starsky truck navigated a rest area near Orlando, merged onto the highway from the left, kept a speed of 55 mph, changed lanes, and exited the highway on the right through a toll booth.\n\nThe remote driver \u2014 sitting behind 3 computer screens in an office 2 hours away in Jacksonville \u2014 used a steering wheel, buttons and foot pedals to maneuver on and off the highway.\n\nAfter he set the speed to 55 mph, the automation took over, with the driver intervening only to order the lane change.\n\nIn all, the human driver operated the truck for just 0.2 miles, or 2% of its journey, says co-founder Stefan Seltz-Axmacher. \"It got pretty boring,\" he says.\n\nYes, but: Teleoperation relies on ordinary cellular networks that occasionally lead to communication glitches that could potentially delay remote decision-making.\n\nFor now, Starsky Robotics trucks are accompanied by chase vehicles in case something goes wrong and a human driver needs to jump into the cab to steer a stopped truck off the highway.\n\nThe bottom line: Automated trucking is getting closer, but the instincts and knowledge of human drivers are still needed, even if the humans themselves aren't in the vehicle.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "Last week, for likely the first time, a heavy-duty commercial truck drove 9.4 miles on the Florida Turnpike with no one inside.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/TKJ-rWFfVFOlq-oLVGdlVNCvMHM=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/06/25/1561493244855.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-26"}
