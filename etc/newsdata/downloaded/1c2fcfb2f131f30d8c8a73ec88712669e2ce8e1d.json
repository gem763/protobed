The honeymoon is long gone. Civil society is much more alert.\n\nThis time is also different because the country\u2019s economy has its back against the wall.\n\nEconomic growth has slowed down to a snail\u2019s pace. The impact of all this is that jobs are scarce, pushing unemployment higher.\n\nGovernment finances are at their weakest \u2013 debt has more than doubled as a percentage of the size of the economy since 2007, tax revenue isn\u2019t growing and government is being sucked deeper into the quagmire of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\n\nWhen looked at purely from the view of government debt, South Africa\u2019s situation is not too dissimilar to the mid-1990s. There are differences though.\n\nThen government debt as a percentage of GDP was below 50% and government didn\u2019t have Eskom and other SOEs to bail out.\n\nSo, economic reform this time around isn\u2019t a luxury. It\u2019s more urgent than it\u2019s ever been as our country\u2019s economic situation is quite dire.\n\nTherefore the package of measures proposed by the ministry of finance deserves the country\u2019s support.\n\nGovernment should implement immediately all those reforms that are less contested. Debates can then continue as the country's political leadership seeks to bring on board those sections of our society that are opposed to some of the reforms\n\nThe document Economic transformation, inclusive growth, and competitiveness: Towards an Economic Strategy for South Africa, proposes a wide range of measures. None are new. They have been served before us, albeit as part of a different menu of economic reform proposals.\n\n\n\nThis doesn\u2019t make them any less valid.\n\nTreasury\u2019s proposed reform menu covers the following themes Modernisation of network industries (including telecommunications and transport);\n\n\n\nLowering of barriers to entry and fixing the distorted patterns of business ownership;\n\nPrioritisation of labour intensive sectors such as agriculture and services;\n\nImplementation of flexible and focused industrial and trade policies; and\n\nPromotion of export competitiveness and regional growth opportunities.\n\nBut bearing in mind that good economics doesn\u2019t make good politics, government must tread carefully in driving the economic reform agenda.\n\nGovernment should not seek to implement the entire package at once.\n\n\n\nRather, it should implement immediately all those reforms that are less contested.\n\nDebates can then continue as the country\u2019s political leadership seeks to bring on board those sections of our society that are opposed to some of the reforms.\n\nGovernment should bear in mind that often it\u2019s the small changes that cumulatively have the biggest impact.\n\nBut government should also start the reform process with the uncontested elements of the reform package so that economic reforms can gather momentum.\n\nAiming at the highly contested reforms at the beginning will stall the reform agenda as the political leadership gets bogged down in street battles.\n\nIn this, South Africa can learn from India\u2019s economic reform experience in the early 1990s.\n\nThen, the Indian government successfully introduced economic reforms that would lift the country\u2019s growth rate above 5%, a rate India has sustained over the years.\n\nAt the same time as India successfully implemented some reforms, it made very little, if any, progress on others.\n\nIndia\u2019s experience in the 1990s is particularly instructive because the successful implementation of reforms was done by a minority government when a majority government, which was led by the same political party, had five years earlier failed to drive through the reform agenda.\n\nIndia and South Africa have a lot of similarities but they also have huge differences too. The use of India\u2019s experience here is purely illustrative.\n\nWhat we learn from India\u2019s economic reforms in the 1990s is that there are major differences between reforms that affect the elites versus those that impact on the masses in any society.\n\nReforms that are likely to affect the masses always run the risk of getting large numbers of people on to the streets in protest, the very thing any sensible politician doesn\u2019t want.\n\nIn his analysis of India\u2019s reforms of the 1990s, Ashutosh Varshney suggests a very simple test of whether a reform measure will attract the attention of the masses.\n\nVarshney is Sol Goldman professor of international studies and the social sciences and professor of political science at Brown University in the US, where he is director of the Centre for Contemporary South Asia.\n\nMass politics often translates into mass protests\n\nVarshney\u2019s test is simply: how many people will be affected by the policy; how organised are they; and, lastly, will the effect of the policy be direct, obvious, and brief, or indirect, subtle and lasting.\n\nThe more direct the impact of an economic reform measure, the more people are affected by it; and the more organised those affected by it are, the greater the chance that such reform will enter mass politics.\n\nMass politics often translates into mass protests.\n\nThe other lesson from India is about taking advantage of opportunities for driving through economic reforms.\n\nIt helps to have an issue \u2013 the more emotive the better \u2013 that keeps the electorate focused elsewhere, away from economic reforms.\n\nWhen there\u2019s an issue that preoccupies an electorate for some time, that creates political room for pushing through some of the reforms.\n\nThis applies in particular to an issue that grabs the emotive imagination of the electorate.\n\nIn India\u2019s case in the 1990s, the emotive issue related to ethnic conflict.\n\nPolitical leadership in South Africa will have to keep its ear to the ground so it can pick up on the issues that preoccupy the emotional imagination of the majority.\n\nBusiness leaders often argue, naively, that politicians should pay greater attention to economic issues so that economic reforms would be much easier to drive.\n\nAs Varshney points out, such an approach is possible under authoritarian regimes, not in democracies.\n\nThe Treasury document mentioned earlier contains a good mix of reforms that will not agitate the masses and those that will most likely get the masses into the streets.\n\nThe document proposes, for example, that government invests in innovative market linkages to assist small-scale farmers achieve scale and ultimately graduate into emerging and commercial farmers.\n\nIt also calls for a greater and more stable budget allocation for tourism promotion agencies as well as special measures to cushion their budgets, specifically marketing budgets, against fluctuations in the value of the rand against major currencies.\n\nI am not aware of any constituency, worthy of worry to politicians, that will oppose these measures.\n\nThe lesson therefore from India\u2019s economic reforms of the 1990s is simply this: To get the economic reform train moving, start with those reforms that are not going to arouse the emotions of the masses.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean giving up on the reforms that will most likely get the masses on to the streets.\n\nSuch an approach gets the agenda off the conference venues into where it runs the risk of making a big difference over time.\n\nGiven all the pressures government, the economy and the people of South Africa are facing, government has to implement the reforms contained in the Treasury document in earnest.\n\nHlengani Mathebula is a former senior executive at the Reserve Bank and SA Revenue Service, and chairperson of the Black Business Executive Circle", "description": "South Africa has yet another opportunity to reform its economy, raise the economic growth rate, create more jobs and ensure that the growth benefits as many people as possible.", "authors": ["Hlengani Mathebula"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9521/9cc8285abb3c404cba6f595e76221446.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
