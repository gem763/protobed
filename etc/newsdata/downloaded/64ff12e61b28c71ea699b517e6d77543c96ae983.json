After his team lost the ball inside the opposition half, Shun Nakamura went for the spectacular immediately.\n\nHis audacious effort in the Japanese second division match lobbed the Ehime goalkeeper, who was miles outside his own penalty area before the ball rolled straight into the empty net.\n\nAnd remarkably within 90 seconds, Tatushiro Sakamoto replicated his team-mates strike with a left-footed strike.\n\nTatushiro Sakamoto then scored from over the halfway line within 90 seconds later\n\nDespite lacking the power or the loft, his left-footed strike still somehow beat Okamoto\n\nBut this time, the player didn't get anywhere near as much loft or power - but the ball still somehow trickled past the Ehime goalkeeper.\n\nThe two strikes in the second half ensured Montedio Yamagata ran out comfortable 3-0 winners against Ehime.\n\nIt wouldn't have been a pleasant experience in the Ehime changing room following the final whistle...", "description": "For goalkeepers, conceding a goal  from over the halfway line is one of those completely humiliating experiences they hope to forget in a flash.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20385110-0-image-a-16_1572451743617.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
