The owner then left the room for a further two minutes before returning.\n\nResearchers said 64.3 per cent of the cats showed signs of \"secure attachment\", stating that when their owner returned, the cats became more relaxed and divided their time into seeking attention and exploring their surroundings.\n\nThe rest of the felines either became overly clingy or completely avoided their owner \u2013 otherwise known as \u201dinsecure attachment\u201c.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News, Vitale said that the characteristics of a secure cat include greeting their owner and then going back to what they were doing.\n\n\"That\u2019s how a secure human also behaves,\" she explained.\n\n\"It\u2019s important for owners to think about that. When they\u2019re in a stressful situation, how they\u2019re behaving can actually have a direct impact on their cats\u2019 behaviour.\"\n\nIn similar research, 65 per cent of children and 58 per cent of dogs showed similar signs of secure attachment to parents and owners.\n\nThe findings are published in the journal Current Biology.", "description": "Cats have developed a bad reputation for acting aloof, independent and unaffectionate to their owners.
