But as he gets up to leave at the end of our interview, I want to be sure I heard him correctly that he will not endorse any candidate in any race between now and November 2020. \u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe only asterisk I\u2019d put on that is the socialism point I\u2019m making,\u201d Sasse adds. He begins talking about how Omaha\u2019s Republican congressman, Don Bacon, is running against an \u201cactual socialist\u201d and he\u2019ll be helping Bacon\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running against the Democrats\u2019 crazy turn toward socialism. But, as a matter of formal endorsements\u2014I mean, I\u2019m working to support the Republican ticket, period. But I\u2019m not endorsing candidates in individual races.\u201d\n\nWait, Sasse is supporting but not endorsing candidates?\n\nDoes supporting the Republican ticket mean supporting Trump in 2020? \u201cAll of the turn toward socialism is disastrous,\u201d Sasse replies.\n\nSo does Sasse support Trump-Pence in 2020?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supporting the Republican ticket.\u201d\n\nUp and down the ticket, including the presidential race?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supporting the Republican ticket,\u201d he replies. \u201cSee ya, dude.\u201d\n\nSasse\u2019s comments leave me confused\u2026.\n\nIn 2016, Sasse cast his vote in the presidential race for Mike Pence, not Donald Trump. Did that count as \u201csupporting the Republican ticket\u201d?\n\nDuring a follow-up phone interview on September 30, I ask Sasse whether he has decided he will vote for Donald Trump (presuming Trump is renominated in 2020) or he might vote for Pence again, as he did in 2016. But Sasse still won\u2019t directly answer the question. \u201cI think that leaving it at supporting the Republican ticket is the right place for me to be,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI plan to do some work for the Republican ticket down the road. Focused on my race right now and really not talking about anybody else.\u201d\n\nEfforts to get Sasse to talk about why he didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016 and whether his assessment of the president has changed don\u2019t prove very successful, either. Sasse says he is \u201creally grateful for the fact that the president has completely kept his word\u201d about judicial nominees, and that Elizabeth Warren\u2019s socialism and majoritarian politics \u201cwould completely baffle the Founders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve said almost everything that I can say about Donald Trump,\u201d Sasse says.", "description": "Sasse says he won\u2019t endorse Trump or any other candidate in 2020 so he can focus on his own race, but he is \u201csupporting the Republican ticket.\u201d", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Jim Geraghty", "A.
