Children as young as 10 are being referred for hormone-blocking drugs, despite concerns they could cause emotional problems and long-term effects on the brain and body which are not yet known. The UK\u2019s Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) saw almost 1,200 children under 15 referred to the service last year, with 63 under-15s sent on to its endocrinology clinic, of whom the majority took powerful puberty-blockers. The NHS England review of its specifications for the GIDS was scheduled to go ahead this year. But outgoing mental health minister Jackie Doyle-Price revealed to Parliament that it will look at the \u2018ethics\u2019 of the service, which offers some treatments to children which may be \u2018irreversible\u2019.\n\nDr Jane Hamlin, president of The Beaumont Society, a transgender support group, told The Telegraph the policy had been 'clearly been thought through very carefully and is sensible and encouraging'.\n\nTory MP for Monmouth, David Davies, said the move 'drives a wrecking ball through those hard fought for rights'.\n\nHe told the paper: 'It means people who are physically male will be placed in women's hospital wards.\n\n'Nobody wants to see transgender patients discriminated against or treated badly in any way.\n\n'But placing people who are physically male in close proximity to vulnerable women who may be facing intimate medical procedures is not fair.'\n\nDr Nicola Williams of Fair Play For Women campaign group told the paper it was 'shocking' and means that women's 'privacy and dignity goes out the window'.\n\n\n\nAn NHS spokesman said: 'The NHS is here to provide all patients with the excellent physical and mental health treatment they need and to support them while they are in our care.\n\n'The revised document on \"delivering same-sex accommodation\" provides clear and considerate guidance for NHS staff so they can prioritise the safety, privacy and dignity of all patients.'\n\nA Department of Health and Social spokesperson said: 'We're working closely with the NHS to consider the findings of the review.'\n\nIt comes just over a month after MailOnline reported health chiefs were reviewing a service which gives transgender children drugs to pause puberty.\n\nNHS England said it was investigating issues around hormone-blocking drugs prescribed to under-18s to \u2018pause\u2019 their adolescence and prevent changes to the body like breasts or facial hair.\n\nChildren as young as 10 are being referred for hormone-blocking drugs, despite concerns they could cause emotional problems and long-term effects on the brain and body which are not yet known.", "description": "Patients will be accommodated based on how they look, the way they dress and what name they go by, according to new NHS England guidelines.
