The White House declined to comment on whether President Donald Trump would sign the Hong Kong legislation, but there are enough votes in the House to override a veto and no significant opposition in the Senate.\n\nThe next step will be up to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who\u2019ll set the schedule for a vote, and he\u2019s being pressed by his Republican colleagues.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to get it up on the floor here fairly soon,\u201d Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a China critic, told reporters.\n\nChinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang warned American lawmakers to stop meddling in China\u2019s internal affairs \u201cbefore falling off the edge of the cliff,\u201d without specifying how it would retaliate. The House action \u201cfully exposes the shocking hypocrisy of some in the U.S. on human rights and democracy and their malicious intention to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability to contain China\u2019s development,\u201d Geng said.\n\nBoth Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have so far prevented the international uproar over Hong Kong from scuttling their trade talks. The two sides went ahead with negotiations and reached some broad agreements last week, even though the House vote was widely expected at the time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this will undermine the prospect of signing a partial deal next month,\u201d said Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China\u2019s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. \u201cThe Hong Kong bill is not a done deal and there is still room for redemption.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Hong Kong government \u201cexpressed regret\u201d over the House action, which came hours before Chief Executive Carrie Lam addressed a raucous session of the Legislative Council. She barely managed a few words before pro-democracy lawmakers forced her to stop talking. She ended up delivering her annual policy address via video instead.\n\nWhile the pro-democracy bloc only comprises about a third of lawmakers, Wednesday\u2019s display showed they have the ability to shut down debate on major economic initiatives. That spells even more trouble ahead for an economy sliding into recession as protests against Beijing\u2019s grip over the city grow increasingly violent.\n\nChina\u2019s retaliation threat against the U.S. roiled markets during Asian trading, at one point wiping out a 0.8% rally in the regional equity benchmark.\n\nU.S. lawmakers have embraced the Hong Kong protesters\u2019 cause as the yearlong trade war fuels American support for pushing back against China, and they have hosted some of the city\u2019s activists on Capitol Hill in recent weeks. The National Basketball Association\u2019s struggle to manage Chinese backlash against a Houston Rockets executive\u2019s support for the movement has only focused wider attention on the debate.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House passed H.Res. 543, a resolution reaffirming the relationship between the U.S. and Hong Kong, condemning Chinese interference in the region and voicing support for protesters. Lawmakers also passed the Protect Hong Kong Act, H.R. 4270, which would halt the export to Hong Kong of crowd-control devices such as tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nRepresentative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican and a sponsor of the main Hong Kong bill, dismissed the threats from Beijing.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Republican senators said Wednesday they want to move quickly on legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong despite a threat of retaliation from China.\u201cHong Kong is a high priority for me,\u201d GOP Senator Jim Risch, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said. \u201cWe\u2019re", "authors": ["Daniel Flatley", "Dandan Li", "Iain Marlow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RCvtnaM8Yi6mp0jMdDBpGQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/76a21b9d5ae2f673dccbdda261b638b5", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
