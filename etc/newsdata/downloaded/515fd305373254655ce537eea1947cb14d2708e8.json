So luckily that one went in.\u201d\n\nHart, who stopped 24 shots in the losing effort, said he read the shot \u201cthe whole way\u201d but made a small and costly mistake.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had it but my stick was a little bit off the ice and it just grazed the bottom of my stick, so I have to make sure I keep my stick on the ice,\u201d Hart said.\n\nBrock Boeser and Pearson scored for the Canucks in regulation, and Chris Tanev added a pair of assists.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just a result of our line playing well, getting pucks deep, going east-west, getting pucks to the net and driving there,\u201d Boeser said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to keep doing that,\u201d the right-winger said.\n\nCarsen Twarynski and Oskar Lindblom scored for the Flyers.\n\nDespite the score in regulation, Hart said most of his work came in extra time.\n\n\u201cThey came on in overtime, so it\u2019s important you make sure you stay into the game, whether that\u2019s little things throughout the game or looking at which way a guy shoots, or who is on the ice, making sure you keep your mind ready,\u201d Hart said.\n\nThe loss was Philadelphia\u2019s first of the season.\n\n\u201cTeams push in this league when they\u2019re down. And I think young teams, young players, that\u2019s a learning experience when you have the lead and you\u2019re getting pushed on and leaned on. We\u2019ll learn from it,\u201d Canucks coach Travis Green said.\n\n\u201cI like that we found a way to win a hockey game. The first two periods were a bit of a chess match. I thought both teams were working hard and fighting for space on the ice.\u201d\n\nJacob Markstrom had 29 saves for Vancouver.\n\n\u201cThey started slinging pucks to the net (in the third),\u201d Pearson said. \u201cThat top line was just throwing everything there, trying to create something. We had to be on our toes but we know we could probably catch some sheen a bit, too.\u201d\n\nThe Canucks got on the board just over five minutes in after J.T. Miller picked off the puck behind the Flyers\u2019 net. He got it up to Tanev at the blue line and the veteran defenseman fired off a long shot.\n\nHart made the save but Boeser was there to grab the rebound. His slap shot beat Hart and put Vancouver up 1-0.\n\nThe Flyers got the equalizer 3:14 into the second frame.\n\nJustin Braun sent a cross-ice pass to Twarnyski alone in the Canucks\u2018 end. The left-winger streaked toward Vancouver\u2019s net, sending a shot past Markstrom on the stick side. Braun and Travis Sanheim earned assists.\n\nThe Canucks bounced back just over a minute later when Tanev collected the puck near the blue line and sent down a long shot. Pearson deflected it in from down low.\n\nPhilly came out strong in the third, peppering Markstrom with a barrage of shots.\n\nOne attempt by James van Riemsdyk looked promising, skimming through the crease before Markstrom, flat on his belly, got a piece of it with his glove and directed the puck out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nThe Flyers outshot the Canucks 9-1 in the first five minutes of the third.\n\nLindbolm scored Philly\u2019s second goal of night on the power play at 14:58 into the frame after Vancouver defenseman Jordie Benn was called for interference.\n\nIt was the first power-play goal the Canucks have given up this season.\n\n\u201cAfter the second we were a little frustrated with how we were playing and knew we could play better but there was no panic, we didn\u2019t change our game, we kept the game plan and it was a big goal to tie it up,\u201d said Flyers right-winger Claude Giroux.\n\nSanheim rang a shot off the post with about 50 seconds left, but the Flyers couldn\u2019t avoid extra time.\n\nBoth sides had opportunities in overtime, including a great chance for Vancouver with just over a minute to go when Philly\u2019s Sean Couturier lost his stick and Bo Horvat got a bit of a breakaway.\n\nHorvat couldn\u2019t burry the puck on the ensuing shot, but Couturier was called for throwing his stick, giving the Canucks a man advantage.\n\nVancouver still couldn\u2019t score, forcing the shootout.\n\nNOTES: The Canucks had 13 giveaways in the contest, compared to just four from Philly. \u2026 Boeser\u2019s goal was his first of the year. The right-winger had 26 goals and 30 assists in 69 outings last season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlyers: At Calgary Flames on Tuesday.\n\nCanucks: Host Detroit Red Wings Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vancouver Canucks forward Tanner Pearson was just looking for some empty space when he sent the puck flying in the shootout Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/flyers_canucks_hockey_46624_c0-373-4069-2746_s1200x700.jpg?b488691e327c270ee7726090ae316a75022be354", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
