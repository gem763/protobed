Almost half (48%) of Republicans support sending grounds troops against ISIS, while just a quarter of Democrats support the same. Air strikes are popular across party lines despite the fact that they are obviously not sufficient to prevent ISIS from making additional gains. Despite what some hawks claim, the public is not clamoring for sending Americans into a new ground war. There continues to be substantial opposition to escalating U.S. involvement in the war.\n\nOddly, there is now more support for arming \u201cmoderate\u201d rebels to fight against ISIS than there was last year. This is the first I have seen more support for this option than opposition to it. It is odd in that it comes at a time when the so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition in Syria has ceased to exist (if it ever existed at all):\n\nThe question is somewhat misleading. It pretends that there were ever \u201cmoderate groups\u201d to be armed, and it creates the impression that \u201cmoderate groups\u201d in Syria would be using these weapons to fight ISIS rather than regime forces. If respondents were asked, \u201cShould the U.S. provide rebels with arms that will shortly end up in the hands of jihadist groups?\u201d I suspect that the result would look very different.\n\nThere were two more interesting results that were not mentioned in the write-up. One was the response to a question about which side in the Syrian civil war the U.S. should take. 11% said the U.S. should back the government, and 14% favored anti-regime rebels. 43% wanted the U.S. to take neither side. There is vanishingly little public support for Syrian rebels overall, and this holds true regardless of party, region, income, or education. Very few Americans share the Syria hawks\u2019 enthusiasm for that cause. Accordingly, a similar percentage believes that the U.S. should never have become involved in the Syrian conflict (44%) while just 24% agree that the U.S. should have become more deeply involved sooner. The default Republican hawkish position among presidential candidates has the backing of less than a third of Republicans (32%).", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Syrian-rebels.jpg", "published_at": "2015-05-28"}
