Which, when you think about it, is about as necessary as telling a gritty, realistic story of a comic-book super-villain who dresses up like a card in a deck. It\u2019s a couple of days old, but this SNL skit is more than funny enough for a palate-cleanser tonight:\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet seen Joker, trust me in saying that this skit is a pitch-perfect parody of the new Todd Phillips film. SNL spared few resources to get this right, including the use of David Harbour to emphasize the potential malevolence of [checks notes again] a puppet that lives in a garbage can.\n\nUnfortunately, the powers that be will never let the true Grouch story be made. Meanwhile, we\u2019ll just have to comfort ourselves knowing that somewhere out there, someone\u2019s working on a gritty, realistic origin story of John Jugworth Jones III.\n\nIn case you missed it over the weekend, my review of Joker can be found here.", "description": "\"Damn, Oscar...\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/snl-grouch.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
