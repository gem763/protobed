Already, storm surge had sent waves crashing onto the street, lapping at coastal homes.\n\nAs wind and rain pummeled her town, Wallace saw utility poles bend and trees snap like twigs.\n\n\u201cA pole is just about ready to hit the ground,\u201d she said on the phone, trying to keep calm to avoid alarming her 2-year-old son.\n\nThen came a bang.\n\n\u201cThat was my hurricane shutter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just flew into the road.\u201d\n\n1 of 49 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene as Hurricane Dorian hits the Bahamas and Floridians prepare for the storm View Photos Dorian closes in on the northern Bahamas, battering the islands with Category 5 winds, pounding waves and torrential rain.

(Ramon Espinosa/AP)\n\n\u201cI can say that in the Marsh Harbour area of Abaco, parts of it is already underwater and in some areas, you cannot tell the difference as to the beginning of the street or where the ocean begins,\u201d Minnis continued. \u201cAnd they have not yet been hit by the brunt of the storm.\u201d\n\nDorian\u2019s strike on the northern Bahamas, officials and witnesses said, appeared to be a catastrophe in the making, with wind speeds accelerating just as the storm slowed. Residents of the northern Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama \u2014 including villagers who stayed put on low-lying cays \u2014 were hunkering down for a siege that could see some parts of this nation of nearly 400,000 people withstand hurricane conditions for two days. It could feel to some like an hours-long tornado.\n\nOn the Abaco Islands, violent waves and lashing wind and rain tore apart docks and power lines as Dorian strengthened to Category 5 right before it struck. Drone footage from state broadcaster ZNS and images on social media showed massive flooding and damaged, impassible roads in Marsh Harbour. One of the country\u2019s two major cellphone operators lost service, but some residents in the hardest-hit areas still had limited communication at least through the eye of the storm.\n\nLow-lying Marsh Harbour, the largest town in the Abacos, suffered storm surges. Officials said the Mudd, a shantytown of Haitian immigrants, was severely damaged. Roofs were blown off hotels and homes.\n\n[Tracking Hurricane Dorian]\n\nIn a desperate live video posted on Facebook, a woman wailed from her perch in a roofless apartment building in Marsh Harbour as the floodwaters rose around her.\n\nGertha Joseph, a 34-year-old mother of a 4-month-old who goes by the name Jetta Clavi on social media, said some neighbors tried to swim across the rushing waters to a cluster of houses.\n\n\u201cBut the water just took them,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cSome people, they didn\u2019t get to make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray for us, pray for us, me and my baby, everyone who stayed in the apartment building, we stayed right here, please pray for us, pray for Abaco,\u201d she sobs. \u201cI\u2019m begging you, pray for us.\u201d\n\nAnother video surfaced of one man begging for help as rain raged inside his home.\n\nThe nation\u2019s Ministry of Health said late Sunday afternoon that it had not confirmed any deaths from the storm.\n\nSocial media, for those able to find limited cellular service, became a lifeline and information depot. In the island district of Hope Town, according to a Facebook page set up by residents, villas and furniture were washed away, a local lodge had collapsed, and \u201cmany houses\u201d had been destroyed.\n\nDorian\u2019s eyewall was on course to hit island communities farther west, even as the storm was slouching forward at a painfully slow 7 mph. The speed could reduce further, experts warned.\n\nIn a country still struggling to recover from a litany of major storms in recent years, targeted evacuations had been ordered. Authorities and volunteers aided with transit by sea and land. More than 50 residents of Grand Cay were trapped for more than seven hours overnight as they attempted to leave the area. They finally escaped by boat.\n\n\u201cA vessel departed at 5:30 a.m. from Grand Cay with 58 persons onboard en route to Grand Bahama,\u201d said Capt. Stephen Russell, director of the National Emergency Management Agency. \u201cThere may be a few more, but that\u2019s the most the boat can take now under the circumstances, and that may very well be the last trip there.\u201d\n\n[Incredible views of Category 5 Hurricane Dorian near peak intensity]\n\nMaxine Duncombe, administrator of Central Abaco, said more than 500 people lived on cays off the district and most had remained despite evacuation orders.\n\n\u201cI would say at least 90 percent of the persons stayed on the cays,\u201d she said. \u201cThey did not avail themselves of the transportation that was provided for them to be evacuated.\u201d\n\nThe northern Bahamas could spend an extended period within Dorian\u2019s eyewall, the National Hurricane Center said, where they would be subjected to punishing wind, more than two feet of rain, and storm surge 10 to 15 feet above normal. Airports were closed on the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama.\n\nGrand Bahama is home to Freeport, the nation\u2019s second-largest city, which stood right in the storm\u2019s path. Islanders there joined desperate lines to stock up on food and gas. On Sunday, one woman described conditions as \u201ceerily calm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe weather is really okay here,\u201d said Sarah Kirby, a 50-year-old public relations executive. \u201cIt just looks like a regular rainy day. But we all know that a big storm is coming.\u201d\n\nFaiola reported from Miami.\n\nRead more:\n\nBahamas taking horrific direct hit from intense Category 5 Hurricane Dorian\n\nHurricane warnings posted for Florida\u2019s east coast\n\nHurricane forecasters turn to new tools to predict when storms will rapidly intensify\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Islanders are hunkering down for nearly two days of dangerous hurricane conditions.", "authors": ["Jasper Ward", "Anthony Faiola", "Correspondent Covering Latin America", "Venezuela", "Argentina", "Brazil", "Human Rights", "Poverty", "Globalization", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RjO6DDg2ysVh1DVgb8lrUnZyOug=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GXD27MWM3YI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
