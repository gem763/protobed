Image caption Which? members said Belfast International looked \"shabby\"\n\nBelfast acknowledged passengers had faced problems during the past 18 months, but said satisfaction had improved since the Which? survey.\n\nThe airport has invested \u00a31m in expanding its security area after long delays meant passengers had to queue outside the airport in freezing conditions in March.\n\nIt has also expanded its range of food and drink outlets amid complaints from Which? members that the choice was too limited.\n\nOf the largest airports with more than 10 million passengers a year, Luton was the worst performer, a position it has held for four years running.\n\nDespite terminal improvement works finishing in December, Luton travellers complained about \"limited seating\" and \"congested\" security queues.\n\nAberdeen International was ranked the worst Scottish Airport for the fifth year in row, with a customer score of 50%.\n\nCustomers criticised its staff and seating, with one telling Which? they only used the airport for \"geographic convenience\", not out of choice.\n\nBest performers\n\nBy contrast, Doncaster Sheffield topped the survey for the third year in a row, with customers calling it a \"cosy airport\" with no queues that was \"easy to navigate\".\n\nThe Yorkshire hub got a customer satisfaction score of 86% - although some respondents said they wished it offered more connections than its current 55.\n\nHeathrow Terminal 5 was the best performing large airport, with a score of 66%. Customers praised its ample seating, helpful staff and toilet facilities, although there were complaints about its high parking charges.\n\nA spokesperson for London Luton Airport (LLA) said: \"We're disappointed by our ranking but pleased to see this year's customer score has improved 23% compared to last year. This highlights passengers are now beginning to see the benefits of our \u00a3160m redevelopment.\"\n\nThey added that of the 4,499 people surveyed by Which?, only 273 had used Luton, while the airport has more than 16 million passengers a year.\n\nSteve Szalay, managing director of Aberdeen International Airport, said Which's survey was \"months out of date and in no way tallies with the hugely positive feedback we're receiving from the tens of thousands of passengers who are travelling through our doors on a weekly basis\".", "description": "London Luton and Manchester T3 also did badly in the survey by consumer magazine Which?.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B0FC/production/_105980354_4c9a8b68-4494-4278-a3c1-426be0ce07bf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
