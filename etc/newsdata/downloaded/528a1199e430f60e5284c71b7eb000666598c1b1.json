This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s been wrong on economics", "language": "en", "text": "By Matthew Lau\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1517, in Wittenberg, Germany, Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the Castle Church door, igniting the Protestant Reformation. Now, 502 years later, there are new reasons to call for protest and reform of the Pope\u2019s thinking: his views and pronouncements on the alleged evils of free markets are clearly fallible.\n\nIn his latest economic missive, to mark World Food Day last Wednesday, Pope Francis decried capitalism and business profits as the cause of starvation. \u201cThe battle against hunger and malnutrition,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the head of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, \u201cwill not end as long as the logic of the market prevails and profit is sought at any cost.\u201d The problem with this statement is that the facts and evidence demonstrate just the opposite.\n\nFree markets and capital investment by businesses in search of profits have lifted billions out of poverty and spared the masses from hunger and misery\n\nIn 1820, the global rate of extreme poverty was around 90 per cent but thanks to the seeds of economic growth planted during the Industrial Revolution, this number fell to 35 per cent by 1990, and then to 10 per cent by 2015. Over the past two centuries, free markets and capital investment by businesses in search of profits have lifted billions out of poverty and spared the masses from hunger and misery.\n\nOf course, this 200-year period of progress has not been without setbacks. There was, for example, the starvation of an estimated six million people in 1932-33 in the Soviet Union, though this could hardly be blamed on capitalism and free markets. Similarly, the current hunger crisis and massive impoverishment in Venezuela in recent years are surely not the results of \u201cthe logic of the market\u201d and profit-seeking businesses.\n\nFrom where then comes the idea that capitalism causes hunger? The Pope reaches this conclusion by drawing a connection between the approximately 700 million people around the world who are overweight and the 820 million who are hungry. Apparently, people are starving in poor countries because obese people in rich countries consume too much of the world\u2019s food supply.\n\nGiven this zero-sum view of the world, we will perhaps hear in the Pope\u2019s next economics lecture that, by consuming more than their fair share of the world\u2019s health care, the countries with the most physicians per capita are responsible for the relatively shorter life expectancies in the poorest countries where there are the fewest doctors.\n\nIn the Pope\u2019s world of alternative economics, it seems, up is down, left is right, good is bad \u2026\n\nThese sorts of economic errors from Pope Francis are nothing new. In 2013, he claimed, as if reading a script supplied by the Occupy movement, that \u201cwhile the income of a minority is increasing exponentially, that of the majority is crumbling.\u201d This \u201cimbalance\u201d was allegedly the result of the \u201ctyranny\u201d of financial markets and free market ideologies that \u201cdeny the right of control to states, which are themselves charged with providing for the common good.\u201d\n\nThe Pope again castigated capitalism earlier this year as \u201ca fallacious economic model that has been followed for too long.\u201d The focus on economic growth instead of sustainable development, said the Pope, \u201chas led the modern economic system down a dangerous path where progress is assessed only in terms of material growth, on account of which we are almost obliged to irrationally exploit the environment and our fellow human beings.\u201d\n\nFree markets as tyrannical? Voluntary exchange as irrational exploitation? State control as the formula for promoting the common economic good? In the Pope\u2019s world of alternative economics, it seems, up is down, left is right, good is bad, black is white, capitalism creates poverty, and obesity is the cause of starvation.\n\nLike Martin Luther, good economists should find much of the Pope\u2019s thinking in need of reform. In 1517, Luther protested the Pope\u2019s sale of indulgences to build St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on the backs of the poor. In 2019, the current Pope\u2019s impoverishing economic ideas also deserve protest.\n\nMatthew Lau is a Toronto writer.", "description": "Facts and evidence argue just the opposite", "authors": ["Matthew Lau", "Special To Financial Post"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/pope-francis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
