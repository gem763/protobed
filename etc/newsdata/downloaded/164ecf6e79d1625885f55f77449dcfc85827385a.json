Scorpio has further alleged that at least R5.3m of the R16.1m flowed to Mahuna Investments. Scorpio reported that Mr Malema used Mahuna Investments' business account as his \"personal slush fund,\" the organisation explained.\n\nSanef further challenged Malema and other EFF leaders to use appropriate channels to disprove these reports, which include the Ombud's office and the Press Council if they feel aggrieved.\n\nALSO READ: Sanef 'appalled' by Malema's call to ban amaBhungane, Daily Maverick's Scorpio from EFF events", "description": "The South African National Editor's Forum (Sanef) says that besides many failed attempts it remains determined to engage the EFF.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9344/5741fed9d14c44f7a5bc7cee7d74cd86.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
