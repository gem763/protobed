He used to come in my old amateur gym, Lochend, a lot. When they announced \u2018the fighting pride of Scotland\u2019 as the winner, the house came crashing down, it was such a relief. I never believed I would do it this quickly. I\u2019ve only been a pro for four years.\"\n\nIndeed, this was a close encounter with elite boxing skills and brutal intent between two brilliant southpaw boxers who had never previously tasted defeat in the prizefighting ranks, and both men fought with a self belief and ferocity which made this is a special night, a special contest in London's Docklands.", "description": "Securing a boyhood dream, Josh Taylor defeated Regis Prograis at the O2 Arena over 12 pulsating rounds in a battle of minds and fight science to become the first Scotsman to unify world titles since the great lightweight Ken Buchanan outpointed Ruben Navarro in Los Angeles in 1971.", "authors": ["Gareth A Davies", "Boxing Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214253662-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqG6uvMzRsA2gL76S9bNdwvhmlF41RiA7tG3prCrw2yf8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
