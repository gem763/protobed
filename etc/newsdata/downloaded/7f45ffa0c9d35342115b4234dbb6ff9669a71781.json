This was in addition to the first-of-its-kind deal the Chinese government awarded Biden\u2019s private equity firm Rosemont Seneca in the recently formed Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, a deal that allowed the firm to focus on international acquisitions.\n\n\u201cWith the backing of the state-owned Bank of China, one of the country\u2019s \u2018big four\u2019 financial institutions, BHR had access to the types of deals that most Western firms only dreamed of, including IPOs of state-owned companies,\u201d Schweizer and McLeod write, noting that Biden\u2019s firm \u201cinvested in strategically sensitive assets in both China and the United States.\u201d\n\nThey write:\n\nIn December 2014, BHR became an \u201canchor investor\u201d in the IPO of China General Nuclear Power Company (CGN), a state-owned nuclear company involved in the development of nuclear reactors. Not only is CGN a strategically important company in China, it was also facing legal scrutiny in the United States. In 2016, CGN was charged with espionage by the Justice Department for stealing US nuclear secrets. As a \u201ccross-border\u201d investment fund, Bohai Harvest was interested in making deals outside of China. In 2015, BHR acquired Henniges Automotive, a Michigan-based producer of vibration-dampening equipment, alongside Chinese military contractor Aviation Industry Corp. of China (AVIC). Given the military applications of Henniges\u2019 technology, the deal required federal approval. Like CGN, AVIC was suspected of stealing US technology for its purposes. Not long after the Henniges deal closed, AVIC debuted its new J-20 fighter \u2014 incorporating designs allegedly stolen from the US\u2019 F-35 program.\n\nSchweizer and McLeod conclude by asking, \u201cDid the Chinese give favorable treatment to Hunter Biden to curry favor with his vice-president father? The American public deserves to understand what exactly Hunter Biden was doing overseas and the extent of then-Vice President Biden\u2019s involvement.\u201d\n\nThe timing of Hunter Biden\u2019s business deal is particularly problematic. His father was negotiating U.S. policy with China at a time when the regime\u2019s behavior had become increasingly menacing to U.S. allies in the region. Vice President Biden\u2019s kid-gloves treatment of China during that trip\u2014a fact which was widely criticized by U.S. allies at the time\u2014also raises questions in light of the lucrative business deals his son secured just two weeks later.\n\nBiden\u2019s BHR focused on strategic energy and defense projects, including U.S. companies specializing in technology used by our military, as Breitbart\u2019s Haris Alic reported:\n\nIn 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) \u2014 an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government \u2014 made a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company. The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced \u201cdual-use\u201d anti-vibration technology with U.S. \u201cmilitary applications.\u201d CFIUS, which is made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the Departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is required to review any transaction with national security implications. When the AVIC and BHR\u2019s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry. In particular, many noted that AVIC was \u201creportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,\u201d which it later \u201creportedly incorporated \u2026 into China\u2019s J-20 and J\u201131 aircraft.\u201d Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC, purchasing 51 percent of the company while BHR took ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter stated the deal was the \u201cbiggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition of foreign technology is a key component of China\u2019s aggressive \u201cMade In China 2025\u201d (MI2025) strategy to overtake the United States economically and militarily by dominating key technologies of the future (i.e. artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles, 5G telecommunications, etc.). A 2017 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce explained the role private equity firms like Hunter Biden\u2019s play in this strategy. The Chinese government \u201cis injecting state funds into private equity to fund foreign acquisitions\u201d of companies with technology identified as a priority for MI2025, according to the report.\n\nIn his extensive report last February on China\u2019s \u201cwhole-of-state\u201d strategy for global dominance, Florida Senator Marco Rubio also noted the communist regime\u2019s reliance on \u201cintellectual property acquisitions\u201d to achieve its ambitions.\n\n\u201cChina is becoming a significant shareholder in U.S. industries, and is selectively targeting those with strategic implications,\u201d Matt Stoller and Lucas Kunce wrote in The American Conservative last June. Their analysis exposes the extend to which China has co-opted Wall Street against the longterm interests of the American economy and national security. For example, they write:\n\nJennifer M. Harris, an expert in global markets with experience at the U.S. State Department and the U.S. National Intelligence Council, researched a recent explosion of Chinese strategic investment in American technology companies. She found that China has systematically targeted U.S. greenfield investments, \u201ctechnology goods (especially semiconductors), R&D networks, and advanced manufacturing.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s attorneys told ABC News last June that Biden still sits on BHR\u2019s board and owns a minority stake in the fund.\n\nAt his campaign rally in Minneapolis yesterday, President Trump called out Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with China while his father was negotiating U.S. policy with the communist regime.\n\n\u201cBiden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cAnd Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we are not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich, and that is substantiated, while America got robbed. That\u2019s what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America.\u201d\n\nThe House Democrat impeachment inquiry has brought renewed interest in the sweetheart deals Hunter Biden\u2019s private equity firm secured while his father was vice president, as detailed in Schweizer\u2019s 2018 bestseller Secret Empires.\n\nDemocrats allege that President Trump attempted to coerce the Ukrainians into investigating corruption charges against former Vice President Biden during a July phone with his Ukrainian counterpart.\n\nThe allegation centers around Hunter Biden\u2019s lucrative dealings with a Ukrainian oligarch-owned energy company at a time when his father was mediating U.S. policy towards Ukraine. The natural gas firm Burisma Holdings paid Hunter Biden over $50,000 per month for his work as a board member, despite his total lack of experience in Ukraine or the energy sector. Just a few months prior to landing this Ukrainian deal, Hunter Biden had been dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Navy Reserve for testing positive to cocaine use.\n\nA Ukrainian corruption probe into Burisma Holdings was scuttled in 2016, when Vice President Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to the country if the Ukrainian government did not fire the prosecutor who launched the corruption investigation. Withholding the loans would have thrown the former Soviet republic into insolvency at a time when it was fending off attacks from Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.\n\nBoth Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied the Democrats claim that Trump delayed military funding to Ukrainian in order to pressure Zelensky\u2019s government to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe Trump White House has refused to cooperate with the Democrat impeachment inquiry, declaring it a \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional\u201d investigation.\n\nRebecca Mansour is Senior Editor-at-Large for Breitbart News and the host of Breitbart News Tonight on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125, which broadcasts live weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6-9:00 p.m. Pacific).
