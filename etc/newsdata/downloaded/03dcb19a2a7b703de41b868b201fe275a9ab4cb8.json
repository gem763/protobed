It is the third major storm to target to Japan since the world\u2019s media descended on the country last month, and Typhoon Hagibis \u2013 described as a \u201csuper typhoon\u201d \u2013 is already \u201camong the most explosive rapid intensifications of any tropical cyclone on record anywhere on Earth\u201d.\n\nThere are a lot of words in that statement, provided by the US Joint Typhoon Warning Centre, that fill you with fear. But it\u2019s fair to note that the last two to hit Japan, Typhoon Faxai and Typhoon Mitag, transpired to have no impact on the tournament and caused only brief disruption to a country experienced at handling such events.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHowever, the rugby union community is far from used to it. Two years ago a tremor in Christchurch during the British and Irish Lions tour had journalists fearing the worst, only for locals who experienced the tragedy of the 2011 disaster to confirm it was a regular occurrence and to \u201cget on with it\u201d. So, faced with worst typhoon of the year, we can be forgiven for being a little jumpy on any and every weather update that arrives as the weekend approaches.\n\nBut there is another unusual aspect to all of this, because if Hagibis fails to weaken on its approach to Japan, writers expecting to cover the weekend games in Yokohama have no idea where we will be instead.\n\nWorld Rugby has the provision to relocate games if it fears extreme weather will force them to be cancelled, but given the sheer size of Hagibis \u2013 early satellite images suggest it is larger than Japan itself \u2013 games will have to be moved a long way from the hub of Yokohama and Tokyo.\n\nThat could result in teams, writers and fans finding themselves in a rush to book flights as far north as Sapporo or as far south as Oita. Fans have already shelled out hugely on travel packages and match tickets; will they be compensated? Check the small print, but you already know the answer, don\u2019t you?\n\nYours,\n\nJack de Menezes\n\nDeputy sports editor", "description": "Just when you thought the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals were taking shape, Mother Nature intervenes.
