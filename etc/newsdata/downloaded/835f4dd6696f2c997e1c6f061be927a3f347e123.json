Some 72 per cent of Remain voters hold this view, which compares to just 12 per cent who think a deal will be agreed in time.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

So, whilst levels of scepticism are high, there is no evidence to suggest that they have increased over the last two months.\u201d\n\nDowning Street is understood to be considering a diplomatic push with senior EU figures in the coming days, as Mr Johnson tries to sell his Brexit plan both at home and abroad.\n\nHe spoke to Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte on Saturday, but Mr Rutte made it clear that \u201cimportant questions remain\u201d over the plans.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, will be in Brussels next week to continue talks, but no decision has been made over whether the prime minister will travel out to join him.\n\nIn a glimmer of hope for Mr Johnson, ex-minister Margot James suggested his proposals could win the backing of the 21 exiled Tory MPs, who were expelled from the party for supporting a backbench bid to take no deal off the table.\n\nMs James told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Week in Westminster: \u201cIf the prime minister can get EU and Irish agreement then I think that we would \u2013 we\u2019ve all got reservations \u2013 but we would be prepared to compromise and vote for the deal. Our prime concern really is to avoid Britain leaving without a deal.\u201d\n\nTory Brexiteer Paul Scully also said there was a \u201clot of sympathy\u201d among Conservative Eurosceptics to get the deal through the Commons, adding: \u201cIt does most of the things that Leavers asked of our government to sort out.\u201d\n\nBut Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy, who represents Leave-voting Wigan, said: \u201cThe truth is we\u2019re further away from a deal than we were two months ago and I can\u2019t see this getting anywhere.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson will ask the Queen to prorogue parliament for several days ahead of a Queen\u2019s Speech on 14 October, when the government will lay out out its legislative programme.\n\nCrunch time will come for the prime minister around the European Council summit on 17-18 October, where he must secure agreement from the EU if a deal is to be rubber-stamped in time for Brexit day.\n\nIf not, he could be forced to demand a delay, a move which could derail his premiership.\n\nSource Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,514 GB adults online between 1-4 October.
