He held a cabinet meeting there last week\u2014and has promised to annex if the area if re-elected.\n\nThe stakes are high in today\u2019s election for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who could, in a matter of weeks, be indicted for bribery, fraud, and breach of public trust.\n\nScrape together a coalition of 61 seats in the 120-member Knesset, however, and Netanyahu could manage to avoid the charges. There are two bills already drafted and ready for a vote that would protect him\u2014at least while in office.\n\nTwo of the three cases allege that Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister made deals with media moguls in exchange for favorable press coverage, and the third claims he received gifts in return for political favors. Netanyahu has called the whole process a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeemingly, he wants desperately to be elected so he can pass an immunity bill that will insulate him from prosecution,\u201d said Paul Scham, executive director of the University of Maryland\u2019s Gildenhorn Institute for Israel studies. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think most voters are thinking of that. I think most voters who like him think he\u2019s really made Israel proud internationally and dealt with the Palestinians\u2026of course, half the voters hate him anyway, and would probably hate him if he didn\u2019t have an indictment hanging over him.\u201d\n\nWhatever the case, Netanyahu\u2019s response to the charges could dramatically alter Israel\u2019s democratic institutions and the future of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\n\nFlying right\n\nYou can tell how central the criminal cases are to Netanyahu\u2019s campaign by looking at who he\u2019s allying with, said David Makovsky, a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cHis usual policy preference in the past was being the pilot on a political aircraft, with a wing to the right and a wing to the left,\u201d Makovsky said, explaining that he has now tilted right \u201cbecause he feels people on the right will be more loyal to him personally, and will craft an insulation approach.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to appeal to the right, Netanyahu has promised to annex huge swaths of the West Bank. As soon as he cobbles together a government, he will grab the Jordan Valley, which makes up about 30% of the territory, he said last week. After that, he says, he will push US president Donald Trump to support a plan to annex all the Israeli settlements in the area.\n\nThose moves would likely put an end to any chance of a two-state solution, two experts on Israeli politics wrote in the Times of Israel today. \u201cIn the short term, annexation risks the collapse of the Palestinian Authority and eruption of violence. In the longer term, eliminating Palestinian hopes for national independence will further embolden the growing number of Palestinians calling for \u2018one man one vote,\u2019\u201d wrote Yoni Komorov of the Washington Institute and Moran Stern, a lecturer at Georgetown University, who note that Netanyahu has \u201cmade similar promises in the past and didn\u2019t follow through.\u201d\n\nDefanging the Supreme Court\n\nIf Netanyahu manages to pass a bill giving him immunity, there\u2019s a good chance that the Supreme Court would repeal it. So, alongside the immunity bill has been drafted a bill that would allow the lawmakers to overturn Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority.\n\nIn 2012, he said that knocking back such attempts to curb the court was the \u201creal test\u201d of Israeli democracy. Now, in his move to do just that, he \u201chas created as sense of concern about his intentions\u2014that in his desire to insulate himself, he\u2019s willing to erode some of the institutions that underlie Israeli democracy,\u201d Makovsky said.\n\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world\u2019s most important and interesting news.\n\nMore stories from Quartz:", "description": "The Israeli prime minister hopes to pass a bill that would give him immunity from corruption charges.
