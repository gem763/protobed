You could tell the interviewer that you're looking for a situation that allows you to better contribute by using all of your skills, recommended Cenedella.\n\nJob candidates can sometimes share too much information about their current employer, and that's a major turn off to prospective employers who might worry about your ability to control your emotions or remain professional in other situations.\n\n\"This is not a therapy session,\" said Cenedella. \"You have to realize that everything you say can and will be used against you. Nothing negative.\"\n\nThe real reason: You've hit the ceiling\n\nIf your career has stalled and there's no room for growth at your current employer, it's time to move on.\n\nBut make sure to frame the move in a positive light.\n\nTry saying something like: You've been with the company for five years with outstanding performance reviews and you've made excellent contributions over this time, but don't see a future path where you can continue to utilize your skills effectively for the benefit of the company, suggested Paula Asinof, principal and founder of Yellow Brick Path, a career management and coaching services firm in Dallas.\n\nIf you're feeling bored or unchallenged with your current position, Cenedella recommended saying how you are looking for new challenges and that this company and new opportunity seems to be a good fit for X, Y, Z reasons.\n\nThe real reason: You want more money\n\nWhile switching jobs tends to be the fastest way to increase your salary, no employer wants to hear that's the only reason you are looking for a job.\n\nAsinof suggested saying something like: I am looking for a change that is going to accelerate my career, provide the challenges of a new environment and give me new opportunities.\n\nThe real reason: You're worried you are about to be fired\n\nIf you're on the job hunt because you've had a few bad performance reviews and feel the writing is on the wall, tread carefully with your response.\n\n\"Don't say anything that can be contradicted with reference checking,\" said Skillings.\n\nTry something like: After being in this role for some time, I realized the day-to-day job wasn't as good a fit as I thought. I am excited about this new opportunity for the following reasons [name your reasons here].\n\nThe idea is bringing it back to the skills and value you will bring to the company.\n\nThey pursued you\n\nEven if a recruiter initiated contact about applying for a new position, hiring managers are still going to want to know why you are considering leaving your current gig.\n\nYou can say that you weren't actively looking for a new position, but as you learned more about this role you thought it would be a great fit for your skills and talents.\n\n\"This helps reinforce in the interviewer's mind that this is the right role,\" said Skillings.", "description": "There's one job interview question that often comes up early on in conversations: Why are you looking to leave your current job?", "authors": ["Kathryn Vasel", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190821012917-20190821-informal-meetings-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
