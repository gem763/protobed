And though Gauff was a little off on the nickname, she nailed the instrument.\n\n\u201cIt was a trumpet. He told us that. You didn\u2019t pay attention,\u201d Gauff said toward McNally, as they sat together and shared a microphone.\n\nTeam McCoco is perfect on the court, remaining unbeaten together by topping the No. 9-seeded team of Nicole Melichar and Kveta Peschke 6-3, 7-6 (9) to reach the third round. Gauff and McNally won the U.S. Open junior title last year and teamed for their first WTA doubles title this summer in Washington.\n\nThings are a whole lot different this year, where Armstrong Stadium was packed to the top to watch them and a long line of fans hoping to get in waited outside. They move to the Grandstand on Monday for the third round, when they play the eighth-seeded team of Ash Barty and Victoria Azarenka.\n\n\u201cLast year playing in juniors we actually played a couple matches indoors, so there was only about 20 people there maybe,\u201d McNally said.\n\nThe victory came a day after Gauff\u2019s loss to top-ranked Naomi Osaka in the third round of singles. Their emotional post-match interview, when Osaka invited Gauff to join her, remained the talk of the tournament early Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt showed both personalities from both players,\u201d Roger Federer said. \u201cIn a way also tennis won on the night, not just Osaka. Also Coco, the way she handled herself anyway. It\u2019s incredible at 15. I can\u2019t even think being so well-behaved at 15.\u201d\n\nNO REGRETS\n\nSerena Williams\u2019 coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, has zero regrets about trying to send her a signal from the stands during last year\u2019s loss in the U.S. Open final.\n\nHis hand gesture was noticed by chair umpire Carlos Ramos, who warned Williams for the rule violation, leading to a series of arguments between the two of them. Eventually, she was docked a point for breaking her racket, and then a game for calling Ramos a \u201cliar\u201d and a \u201cthief.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he wishes he hadn\u2019t made that signal, Mouratoglou replied: \u201cNo, I felt like she was lost at that moment and I tried to help her.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI would do the same tomorrow. Really, 100 percent. And if I\u2019m penalized again, I think it\u2019s unfair the same way. If I\u2019m penalized, then everyone should be penalized every day. And nobody is.\u201d\n\nGO FOR GOLD?\n\nFederer has great memories from the Olympics, from meeting his wife to carrying Switzerland\u2019s flag.\n\nHe\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s going to make any new ones.\n\nFederer said he hasn\u2019t decided if he will play in Tokyo in 2020, and isn\u2019t even certain of the eligibility requirements if he does want to participate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m actually going to do it or not because it all depends on family, on scheduling, on body, on future,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nFederer, 38, has been carefully managing his schedule in recent years and will talk to his team about what the plans will be after next year\u2019s Wimbledon. The 2020 Games begin July 24, just two weeks after Wimbledon ends.\n\nFederer won doubles gold with Stan Wawrinka at the 2008 Olympics, when he carried Switzerland\u2019s flag in the opening ceremonies. He added a singles silver in 2012.\n\nHe also met his wife, Mirka, when both competed for Switzerland in 2000, so the Olympics have always been important to him.\n\n\u201cNaturally it\u2019s always going to be a possibility for me to play Tokyo if there is an exemption,\u201d Federer said.\n\n___\n\nAP Tennis Writer Howard Fendrich contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Coco Gauff and Caty McNally have aced doubles tennis together.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/us_open_tennis_25438_c0-274-3873-2532_s1770x1032.jpg?78659cf1eaea2c1eadce47edf78918a7907ba03b"}
