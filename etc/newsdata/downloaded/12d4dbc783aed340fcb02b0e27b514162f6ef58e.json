But on health care, she\u2019s with Bernie.\n\nWarren, a Massachusetts senator and a leading liberal Democratic presidential candidate, has stood out in the 2020 race for her extraordinary focus on detailed plans to address the nation\u2019s most pressing issues. Her website lists specific policies for 43 topics, from gun violence and Social Security to the Electoral College and family farmers.\n\nBut on health care, an issue that matters the most to many voters, Warren is all in on her opponent Bernie Sanders\u2018 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan.\n\nThe seeming inconsistency was highlighted during this past week\u2019s presidential debate by Democratic front-runner Joe Biden as he defended his own plan to expand the health care overhaul put in place while Barack Obama was president.\n\n\u201cThe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d Biden quipped. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack.\u201d\n\nNo issue has defined the early months of the nomination fight more than health care, which has emerged as a powerful proxy in the broader fight for the party\u2019s soul in the age of Trump.\n\nThe issue is a delicate one for Warren. She needs to unify the progressive wing behind her candidacy to overtake Biden in the primary, if she is to emerge as the nominee against President Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nMedicare for All is Sanders\u2018 signature issue, and as such, she can ill afford any daylight on health care between her and Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, if she ultimately hopes to win over his supporters.\n\nOn such a critical issue, Warren allies believe there\u2019s no incentive to complicate the debate with a new plan.\n\n\u201cMaking clear that they\u2019re aligned on the North Star goal of Medicare for All is an important long-term investment in her relationship with Sanders\u2018 voters - as well as an important short-term investment in clarity for all voters,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a vocal Warren supporter.\n\nIndeed, the internal battle over health care has two very clear factions.\n\nBiden leads those who prefer to leave the private insurance market in place but give people the choice to join a government-backed \u201cpublic option.\u201d Sanders leads the approach, which would replace the private insurance market altogether with a single-payer health care system requiring virtually no out-of-pocket costs.\n\nFrom the beginning, Warren has been clearly aligned with Sanders\u2018 faction. Yet some of Sanders\u2018 supporters are not yet convinced that she\u2019s as committed to Medicare for All as the plan\u2019s author. Progressive critics noted, for example, that Warren indicated she supported \u201ca lot of plans\u201d when asked about health care in an interview after the debate.\n\n\u201cI support Medicare for All. I think it\u2019s a good plan. And look, I support a lot of plans - other things that people have come up with. When they\u2019re good plans, let\u2019s do it,\u201d Warren told CBS. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some kind of contest (where) I got to think of mine first. It\u2019s what\u2019s best for the American people.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman later clarified that Warren does not support any plans on health care and that the senator\u2019s reference to supporting \u201ca lot of plans\u201d applied only to other policies.\n\nNina Turner, who co-chairs Sanders\u2018 campaign, applauded Warren\u2019s consistent public embrace of Medicare for All.\n\n\u201cFor Sen. Sanders, it\u2019s a beautiful thing to have a fellow progressive follow his lead on the signature issue of his campaign,\u201d Turner said.\n\nBut she suggested that only Sanders is invested enough in the plan to ensure it ultimately becomes law.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only one who will see it through all the way to the end,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is in his bones.\u201d\n\nKatherine Brezler, who co-founded the group People for Bernie Sanders, said Warren\u2019s embrace of Sanders\u2018 health plan has helped maintain good relations between the two competitors and their supporters.\n\n\u201cI genuinely think that neither camp is really going to have that hard a time voting for the other,\u201d said Brezler, who helped raise money for Warren\u2019s first Senate bid.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign declined to comment for this story aside from pointing to the CBS interview.\n\nDuring the debate, she repeatedly defended her support for the plan, but she let Sanders punch back at Biden when the former vice president raised questions about its cost.\n\nBiden noted Medicare for All would cost taxpayers roughly $30 trillion. A fiery Sanders said the current system would cost $50 trillion while leaving more than 80 million American uninsured or underinsured.\n\nMedicare for All, Sanders said, would cover everyone and eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles and co-payments.\n\n\u201cI \u2026 wrote the damn bill, if I may say so,\u201d Sanders said as Warren looked on.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Her website lists specific policies for 43 topics, from gun violence and Social Security to the Electoral College and family farmers.
