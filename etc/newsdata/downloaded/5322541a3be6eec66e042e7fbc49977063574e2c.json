The show, which has been given a series commitment, will be executive produced by Bialik and her former on-screen paramour Jim Parsons. The Big C creator Darlene Hunt will write and executive produce. Bialik will play the titular Carla, who uses the money her parents set aside for her wedding to instead open a cat cafe. \u201cCarla is an unapologetically big, broad multi-cam with a strong female point-of-view, pushing the format in a way that will be distinctive,\u201d said Fox president of entertainment Michael Thorn. \u201cWe think we have something truly special here.\u201d The original show was created by and starred Miranda Hart. It ran on BBC 2, and later moved to BBC 1. According to Variety, every broadcast network made a play for the series, with Fox winning in the end. Hearty bazingas to them all.", "description": "Mayim Bialik and Jim Parsons are back at it again, remaking Miranda for Fox. Carla will star Bialik.
