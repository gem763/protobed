On Wednesday, the White House released what they called a transcript but was in reality a rough memo that was \u201cthe notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and [National Security Council] policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials told me that they were \"directed\" by White-House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization, and distribution to Cabinet-level officials.\n\nInstead, the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature. One White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\n\nAccording to White House officials who spoke with the whistleblower, this was not the first time that a presidential transcript was \u201cplaced into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive-rather than national security sensitive-information.\u201d In January, it was reported that Trump had gone to \u201cextraordinary lengths\u201d to conceal records of his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBarr stars in the complaint\n\nAttorney General William Barr is first mentioned in the second paragraph of the complaint. He\u2019s mentioned numerous times throughout the nine-page complaint.\n\nThe whistleblower cites the controversial July 25 phone call in which Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Bide, his son and the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server in 2016. Trump requested Zelensky work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, or Barr on the matter.\n\nBarr, whose Justice Department initially blocked the release of the whistleblower\u2019s report to Congress, said he did not know about the request nor was he contacted by Zelensky.\n\nBut in May, months before Trump\u2019s call, Barr announced a DOJ probe into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nMueller testified before Congress the day before the July 25 call. Trump told Zelensky that the special counsel delivered \u201can incompetent performance.\u201d\n\nTrump personally ordered aid to be withheld from Ukraine\n\nOn Sept. 23, the Washington Post reported that Trump told his acting chief of staff and head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Mick Mulvaney to withhold almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine prior to his July 25 phone call with Zelensky.\n\nThe whistleblower cited that on July 18 OMB official informed Departments and Agencies that the President \u201chad issued instructions to suspend all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. Neither OMB nor the NSC staff knew why this instruction had been issued.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, the direct order from Trump to withhold aid from Ukraine was explicitly restated during interagency meetings on July 23 and July 26, but OMB officials \u201cstill were unaware of a policy rationale.\u201d", "description": "Here are the key points in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint against President Trump that was made public on Thursday morning.", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman", "Christopher Wilson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4bQLYDUY.LImMTb_T215.A--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/886fb8e0-e066-11e9-bfbc-41022f19a795", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
