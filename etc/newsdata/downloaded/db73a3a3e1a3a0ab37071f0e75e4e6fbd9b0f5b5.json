What\u2019s missing in the NEM is a comprehensive, transparent information system \u2013 although hard to believe, we\u2019re actually flying blind. Congested transmission lines and lack of second-by-second information from the distribution systems that actually pipe electricity to consumers, many of whom add to the growing lack of stability by pumping solar back into networks, are the root cause of the lamentable state of the NEM. Not solving the information system and making up for this by planning fast start-up generation is putting the cart before the horse.\n\nDistribution networks should no longer be seen as predictable load centres; they are dynamic and therefore information and control systems that were once intended only for the generation and transmission sectors, now have to be extended to include distribution networks. They have to be integrated with AEMO control systems to provide an essentially seamless, second by second view of the entire NEM, thus providing in due course the basis for stability based on learning experiences.\n\nPhil Kreveld\n\nPower Parameters\n\nWestmeadows, Vic\n\nKeep opinion right out of the news pages\n\nThe Financial Review is managing better than most newspapers to maintain the quality of its reporting. One concerning trend however, is the placement of biased opinion pieces in the News section.\n\nA case in point is Aaron Patrick\u2019s article on the NDIS (\u2018\u2018Government and budget can\u2019t afford limitless NDIS scheme\u2019\u2019, September 30). Loaded language such as \u201cwell-meaning doctors\u201d, and \u201cfostering the belief\u201d, mark the piece as an opinion and disqualify it as reporting.\n\nMention of a \u201clesbian suffering multiple sclerosis\u201d, even though her sexual orientation is irrelevant to the case, was nothing more than smirking titillation.\n\nThat aside though, I did admire the boldness of Mr Patrick\u2019s claim that a program with a $4.6 billion underspend is a \u201clong-term threat to the budget\u201d that \u201cwill be impossible to control \u201c.\n\nMitchell Browne\n\nBlaxland, NSW\n\nLow rates put a second GFC in the frame\n\nPaul Singer and Ray Dalio (chief executives of billion-dollar investment companies), Mohamed El-Erian (chief economic adviser at Allianz), Warwick McKibbin (former RBA board member), Adrian Blundell-Wignall (former OECD director) and Satyajit Das (former banker, economic analyst and author) have all criticised central banks for minimising cash rates.\n\nMinimal and even increasing negative interest cash rates have failed in Japan and OECD countries.\n\nThe public endure minimal interest, or no-interest deposit accounts and the low dollar value will increase import prices. Personal debt is growing unsustainably to over over 200 per cent per annual income. Home prices and share prices are becoming excessive, increasing wealth inequality.\n\nSome people will be tempted to increase their debt levels and investment risks if the cash rate is minimised. Are we headed for the GFC mark II?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGraham McPherson\n\nMandurah, WA\n\nBlame the megabrains for WeWork\u2019s issues\n\nMedia and analysts seem to want us to conclude that chief executive Adam Neumann was at the centre of everything wrong with WeWork.\n\nThe real culprit is an investing environment where stars like Masayoshi Son of Softbank and the big boys running large institutions have a compulsion to raise mega funds, make mega fees, generate alpha returns, lead mega IPOs and master the universe!\n\nNeumann is just their mascot.\n\nChetan Shah\n\nBeecroft, NSW\n\nStop muddying the waters on China policy\n\nLabor\u2019s current overtures to Beijing are, at best, unhelpful (\u201cPolitical split over China\u201d, October 1).\n\nFor foreign policy to be effective, it needs to be authoritative, unequivocal, and a country has to speak with one voice. Our relationship with China is of utmost importance and must be conducted with clarity and mutual respect. Labor\u2019s intervention muddies the waters to an extent where that is at risk.\n\nMichael Schilling\n\nMillswood, SA", "description": "Electricity market, NDIS, interest rates, WeWork, China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4572%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0e0aaea4c5b0feee31979472626ed3e237098d49", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
