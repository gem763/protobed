(Marisa Iati/The Washington Post)\n\nNEWARK \u2014 The tap water ran over Yvette Jordan\u2019s hands as she washed a red plastic cup, then a green cup and then a white ceramic bowl. In the south Newark home where she has lived since 1989, Jordan moved a case of 24 plastic water bottles away from a stack next to the kitchen sink.\n\nHer husband, Frank Jordan, was cooking pork chops this summer when he turned on the faucet, forgetting that elevated lead levels in the city\u2019s water meant residents had to cook with bottled water. Yvette saw the running faucet and intercepted her husband before the water touched their dinner.\n\nWhen a pediatrician from Flint, Mich., visited her home to discuss Newark\u2019s parallel water crisis, Yvette Jordan remembers the doctor saying it would take her family a while to become inculcated with the habit of using bottled water. Jordan didn\u2019t see that as an adequate solution.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be inculcated,\u201d she said on a Saturday in September. \u201cI want it fixed.\u201d\n\nThe problem inched closer to a permanent resolution last week, when Newark and New Jersey officials announced residents could return to drinking their tap water with city-distributed water filters. Testing completed in September of more than 300 filters showed 97 percent effectively reduced lead levels below 10 parts per billion, which is less than the federally mandated \u201caction level\u201d of 15 parts per billion.\n\n[Newark begins giving residents bottled water amid ongoing lead problems]\n\nActivists, however, want to know why much of the state\u2019s largest city had to rely on bottled water in the first place. Newark first became aware of elevated lead levels in 2017 after the city changed the water\u2019s acidity, which may have made it more corrosive and caused lead from the pipes to enter the water supply. Two years later, lead levels reached a crisis point that kept about 15,000 households from drinking their tap water for more than a month.\n\n\u201cWhy did this happen, how did this happen and could it have been prevented?\u201d Anthony Diaz of the Newark Water Coalition advocacy group asked as he distributed water in the back of a church rectory. \u201cThose are the questions we would like answered.\u201d\n\nIn a crisis that contains echoes of the water-system failure in Flint, Newark residents were urged this summer to use bottled water for drinking, cooking and brushing their teeth after officials said city-provided filters may not have been effectively removing lead from the tap water. Starting on Aug. 12, residents cycled through four city-operated water distribution sites and countless other privately operated centers to stock up on free water each week.\n\nPublic-health experts consider any amount of lead to be dangerous, but the law requires that a city improve its corrosion controls if a certain number of homes test above 15 parts per billion. One water sample in Newark from May 2018 measured 182 parts per billion. Prolonged exposure to lead can cause high blood pressure, kidney damage and stillbirths. Young children who are exposed to lead are particularly likely to experience problems with their brain development and nervous systems.\n\nDiaz said he worries about lead\u2019s potential effects on the city\u2019s students, who could face permanent cognitive issues. He said he\u2019s particularly concerned about some researchers\u2019 hypothesis that lead exposure could be linked with a propensity for violence, considering that Newark already deals with a high homicide rate. Lead also can impair academic performance and add to the achievement gap that commonly exists between affluent and impoverished students.\n\n\u201cHow it changed the trajectory of the development of not only individuals, but the City of Newark \u2014 We haven\u2019t really felt those ramifications yet, and no one\u2019s really talking about it,\u201d Diaz said.\n\nWas the city aggressive or deficient?\n\nIn Newark, officials have said only homes served by one of the city\u2019s two water treatment plants are affected by elevated lead levels. Corrosion control chemicals in the western half of the city have failed to keep lead in the water service lines from leaching into the water supply.\n\nEven after six weeks of bottled-water distribution, residents and activists in September spoke of widespread confusion about which homes were affected by the lead and who was eligible to pick up water from the city. Many families were rationing water to get through the week, while activists tried to make people understand that boiling their tap water would not eradicate the problem.\n\nAs Bessie McKnight waited to pick up a case of water outside Boylan Recreation Center on a Friday in September, she said she was grateful the bottled water provided a safe drinking option for her four grandchildren. Still, she said it was difficult not to be able to turn on her faucet whenever she needed water.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult because every little drop counts,\u201d McKnight, 56, said. \u201cI try not to waste it.\u201d\n\nThe city has not allowed reporters inside its water distribution sites, although they are in public buildings.\n\nIn the eyes of Bishop Jethro James Jr. of the city\u2019s Paradise Baptist Church, city and state officials would have responded more aggressively to the lead crisis had it not been in a predominantly black and low-income city.\n\n\u201cIf this was a neighborhood of predominantly wealthy Caucasian people, there would be jackhammers going right now,\u201d James said.\n\n\n\nA sign advocating for an end to Newark's lead crisis hangs outside St. Lucy's Church, where the Newark Water Coalition distributes cases of water on Saturdays. (Marisa Iati/The Washington Post)\n\nIn June 2018, the environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council filed a lawsuit against Newark alleging that the city failed to provide clean water for its residents and misled them into thinking the water was safe. Newark is fighting the lawsuit in court, and Mayor Ras Baraka (D) told The Washington Post that the NRDC\u2019s claims were \u201cunscientific and not factual.\u201d\n\nAlthough Newark is often mentioned alongside Flint, Dimple Chaudhary, senior attorney at NRDC, said comparisons between the cities are difficult because researchers do not know how high Flint\u2019s lead levels got or for how long they were elevated. In both Newark and Flint, Chaudhary said, the crises began with a failure to properly treat the water to control lead release.\n\nBoth cities also inadequately communicated with residents about the lead, Chaudhary said. Flint has been replacing its 18,000 lead service lines since 2016 and is in the final stages of the project.\n\nBaraka has repeatedly rejected comparisons with Flint and said Newark acted to control the high lead levels as soon as officials knew there was a widespread problem. In May, the city started using a new corrosion control treatment that was expected to take several months to start working.\n\nOfficials in August announced a $120 million county-backed bond to replace the city\u2019s 18,000 lead service lines in the next 24 to 30 months. A new lease agreement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey also will provide $155 million, the city said this week. As residents now readjust to drinking filtered tap water, the state will pay for a program to help residents install their filters and test water samples from individual homes.\n\n\u201cI think that we are moving very aggressively,\u201d Baraka told The Post. \u201cAnd I think that we are going to be the only city in the country that has tried to fix this entire problem solely on their own.\u201d\n\n[The Energy 202: Here\u2019s why Newark\u2019s lead crisis is different]\n\nTo Yvette Jordan, the city\u2019s efforts have not been aggressive enough. For weeks, bottled water was placed strategically throughout her home: Five cases in the kitchen and seven next to the staircase, plus a bottle in the upstairs bathroom and a bottle at each of three water bowls for the couple\u2019s dog and two cats. Sometimes Jordan and her husband picked up cases from city- or church-run distribution sites. Other times, they bought water with their own money.\n\nThe Jordans said they were frustrated that the city did not better communicate with residents about the crisis, like by holding more training sessions to educate people about the lead and the steps they should take. The city hosted a \u201cstate of water\u201d town hall Wednesday and has held virtual information sessions about the crisis.\n\nYvette Jordan, a history teacher at Newark\u2019s Central High School, talked with students about the lead issue in her social-justice class while city residents were urged to drink only bottled water. Some students told her they sometimes drank bottled water and other times drank tap water. Other students said they had been replacing water with juice or Kool-Aid \u2014 but they often combined their Kool-Aid mix with water from the faucet.\n\nJordan, 59, is a member of the Newark Education Workers Caucus, a social-justice-focused subset of the city\u2019s teacher\u2019s union that has joined the NRDC\u2019s lawsuit against the city.\n\nBaraka, the mayor, has called the NRDC outside agitators who are needlessly sowing panic among residents. Jordan said Baraka\u2019s words remind her of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assertion in \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail\u201d that labeling a group as \u201coutside agitators\u201d dismisses attempts to rectify injustice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing now,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cNRDC and NEW Caucus are not outside agitators. There is injustice here, and that\u2019s why we are doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u2018A slap in the face\u2019\n\nIn a basement lacking air conditioning at St. Lucy\u2019s Church in the city\u2019s Central Ward, Lenny Thomas sits at a fold-up table for six hours on Saturdays and waits for residents to stop by to pick up bottled water.\n\n\u201cWould you like an option?\u201d Thomas said to a woman on a Saturday in September as she surveyed boxes of water stacked against the wall. \u201cYou can have one of those cases there, which is approximately three gallons of water, or you can have that one over there that says \u2018Poland Spring.\u2019 It has six gallons of water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a case,\u201d the woman said as she lifted a 24-pack of water bottles from the cases branded with the logos of Giant, Market Pantry, Shop Rite and Nestle.\n\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d Thomas, 72, exclaimed as the resident walked out.\n\nAs part of the Newark Water Coalition, Thomas and other volunteers have been distributing water to about 300 residents every week. They advocate for increased education about the water crisis, more treatment options for people affected by lead, and legislation to remove all the lead service lines in New Jersey. The group also wants the city to more clearly identify how this problem arose and to hold someone responsible.\n\n\n\nAnthony Diaz of the Newark Water Coalition loads a handcart with water during one of the organization's weekly water distribution events at St. Lucy's Church. (Marisa Iati/The Washington Post)\n\nThe city first announced in September 2017 that it had exceeded the federal \u201caction level\u201d for lead and would begin taking inventory of Newark\u2019s lead service lines and replacing them. The city again exceeded acceptable lead levels in December of that year.\n\nAs Newark again exceeded the action level for lead in June 2018, city officials repeatedly insisted the water was safe to drink. The city\u2019s 2017 water quality report led with a statement from Baraka that Newark had \u201csome of the best water in the State of New Jersey.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of you have heard or read the outrageously false statements about our water but please know that the quality of our water meets all federal and state standards,\u201d Baraka wrote. \u201cThe only high lead readings were taken inside of older (pre-1986) one- and two-family homes that have lead pipes leading from the City\u2019s pure water in these structures.\u201d\n\nBaraka told The Post that language in that document and others indicating the water was safe was meant to be considered alongside later mentions that some homes with lead service lines could have elevated lead levels. Still, he said, he \u201ccould see that it could have been clearer.\u201d\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency in October 2018 notified the state that Newark\u2019s corrosion-control treatment was no longer keeping lead out of the water. The city began distributing filters to homes within days. Baraka said the city had not distributed filters earlier because officials were unaware the lead was a widespread problem and not affecting just a handful of older homes.\n\nNewark then started handing out bottled water in August when the EPA urged it to do so. An ordinance passed in September will allow city officials to come onto people\u2019s properties to replace their lead service lines with or without their permission \u2014 a move the mayor said protects renters from landlords who may not feel compelled to sign up for service line replacement.\n\nAs Amber Harrison and her husband were about to close on the purchase of their north Newark home last year, they learned the house was serviced by lead pipes. Harrison, 34, said she felt it was too late to back out of the sale, and the city assured her it was working to replace Newark\u2019s lead service lines.\n\nHarrison, a teacher at a New York City charter school, said she immediately started buying bottled water for her 9-year-old son, Dylan. Although officials have said residents can safely shower and wash dishes with unfiltered tap water, Harrison said she worries using tap water for those tasks still could cause harm. She and her husband have worked hard to make Dylan\u2019s childhood easier than their own, Harrison said, and she\u2019s disheartened she has to fight for him to have clean drinking water.\n\n\u201cOne thing we made a pact on is ensuring that our kid is able to have the necessities that weren\u2019t necessarily in reach for us growing up,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s almost kind of like a slap in the face.\u201d\n\nHarrison said she\u2019s also concerned that her father-in-law, who in June was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, may have contracted the cancer from drinking the city\u2019s unfiltered tap water for the past year. He has Type 2 diabetes, she said, and drinks more water than many people.\n\nCity officials long have talked about the \u201crenaissance\u201d they say is sweeping over Newark as a wave of development floods downtown. But Diaz, of the Newark Water Coalition, said the city\u2019s handling of the lead issue gives him little confidence that the administration can fix other major issues central to the city\u2019s revival.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a population that\u2019s focused on crime, unemployment, getting a job, keeping food on the table, keeping the lights turned on, they can\u2019t take on another issue,\u201d said Diaz, 33. \u201cLife is already so hard for them, and there\u2019s already this level of trauma in this city. And you just add something else to it.\u201d\n\nDuring a quiet moment at a water distribution site last month, Diaz loaded cases of water bottles onto a red hand truck to move them closer to the room\u2019s entrance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to start having nightmares about this,\u201d Diaz joked as he tipped the hand truck onto its back wheels.\n\nThen he pushed the cart toward the door, unloaded the water bottles and brought the hand truck back across the room for more.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Energy 202: Booker addressed contaminated water at Democratic debate \u2014 without mentioning Newark\n\nOne city\u2019s solution to drinking water contamination?
