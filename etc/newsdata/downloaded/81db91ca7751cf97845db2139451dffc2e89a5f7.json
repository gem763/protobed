As reported by the New York Times, most of the candidates expressed support for a big carbon tax that would be especially painful for poor and middle-class taxpayers.\n\n\u2026more than half of the 10 candidates at the forum openly embraced the controversial idea of putting a tax or fee on carbon dioxide\u2026 Around the country and the world, opponents have attacked it as an \u201cenergy tax\u201d that could raise fuel costs, and it has been considered politically toxic in Washington for nearly a decade. \u2026In addition to proposing $3 trillion in spending on environmental initiatives, Ms. Warren also responded \u201cYes!\u201d when asked by a moderator, Chris Cuomo, if she would support a carbon tax\u2026 Senator Kamala Harris of California, who on Wednesday morning released a plan to put a price on carbon, \u2026calling for outright bans on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for oil and gas, and on offshore oil and gas drilling. \u2026Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who also released his climate plan on Wednesday, took the stage declaring his support for a carbon tax\u2026 The parade of far-reaching plans on display, ranging in cost from $1.7 trillion to $16.3 trillion\u2026 Two other candidates who said they would support carbon pricing, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nInterestingly, Crazy Bernie didn\u2019t hop on the bandwagon.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont\u2026is one of the few candidates who has not called for a carbon tax.\n\nIn this case, his desire to selectively target upper-income taxpayers presumably is even stronger than his desire to grab more revenue to fund bigger government (and the burden of government would be far bigger under the Green New Deal).\n\nBy the way, there was a very interesting admission in the article.\n\nThe United States generates almost 25 percent of global economic output, yet our share of carbon emissions is much smaller.\n\n\u2026the United States is the world\u2019s largest historic polluter of greenhouse gases, it today produces about 15 percent of total global emissions.\n\nYou would think the climate fanatics would be praising America. But they instead want people to believe the U.S. is worse than Cuba.\n\nAnyhow, let\u2019s return to the main topic of today\u2019s column.\n\nWhat exactly would it mean for ordinary people if politicians imposed a carbon tax?\n\nThe Democrats didn\u2019t offer many specifics last night, so we\u2019ll have to use a proxy estimate. In a column for the Hill, Vance Ginn and Elliott Raia highlight how families would get hit if U.S. politicians followed U.N. suggestions.\n\n\u2026travel\u2026could soon be cost-prohibitive, if the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has its way. \u2026Its recommendation: a carbon tax of as much as $200 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 to an astonishing $27,000 per ton by 2100. For America families, this could mean the price of gasoline soaring to $240 per gallon. Remember when we thought $4 per gallon was high? \u2026Regardless of the amount, a carbon tax would\u2026disproportionately hurt the poor and middle class, who pay a higher percentage of their incomes for motor fuel and energy. \u2026Concrete, for example, is perhaps one of the most common carbon-intensive products\u2026 At the IPCC rate of $200 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, the cost of building with concrete would rapidly rise. \u2026Take a new home of 3,000 square feet. A simple slab foundation (with no basement) could use 100 cubic yards of concrete. Adding a $370 tax per cubic yard for a ton of carbon based on the $200 rate above would mean the cost of that home would likely rise $37,000.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the statists at the International Monetary Fund endorsed a $1.40 tax increase on a gallon of gas in America, which was part of a proposal to increases taxes on the average household by more than $5,000.\n\nTo be fair, I imagine the Democrats \u2013 if ever pressed for specifics \u2013 will propose taxes lower than what the U.N. or I.M.F. are suggesting.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s also fair to warn that taxes which start small almost always wind up becoming onerous.\n\nLet\u2019s close with a political observation.\n\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, people don\u2019t like being saddled with higher taxes. And, as Sterling Burnett explains, they seem especially hostile to energy-related taxes.\n\nFrom Alberta to Australia, from Finland to France, and beyond, voters are increasingly showing their displeasure with expensive energy policies imposed by politicians in an inane effort to purportedly fight human-caused climate change. \u2026This is what originally prompted protesters in France to don yellow vests and take to the streets in 2018. They were protesting scheduled increases in fuel taxes, electricity prices, and stricter vehicle emissions controls, which French President Emmanuel Macron had claimed were necessary to meet the country\u2019s greenhouse gas reduction commitments\u2026 Also in 2018, in part as a reaction against Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s climate policies, global warming skeptic Doug Ford was elected as premier of Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province. Ford announced he would end energy taxes imposed by Ontario\u2019s previous premier and would join Saskatchewan\u2019s premier in a legal fight against Trudeau\u2019s federal carbon dioxide tax. \u2026in August 2018, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was forced to resign over carbon dioxide restrictions he had planned\u2026 In Finland, \u2026the Finns Party, which made the fight against expensive climate policies the central part of its platform, came out the big winner with the second-highest number of seats in Parliament.\n\nI\u2019ve previously written about taxpayer uprisings in France and Australia.\n\nPerhaps the most relevant data, though, is from the state of Washington. Voters in that left-leaning state rejected a carbon tax in 2018 (after rejecting a different version in 2016).\n\nSo maybe Crazy Bernie was being Smart Bernie by not embracing the tax. And Joe Biden also chose not to explicitly back the proposed tax hike.\n\nP.S. The parasitical bureaucrats at the OECD also have endorsed higher energy taxes on the United States.\n\nP.P.S. I don\u2019t have an informed opinion on the degree of man-made warming, but I am highly confident that statists are using the issue to promote bad policies that they can\u2019t get through any other way.", "description": "I\u2019ve warned (over and\u00a0over and\u00a0over again) that supporters of larger .09/06/2019 22:12:09PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
