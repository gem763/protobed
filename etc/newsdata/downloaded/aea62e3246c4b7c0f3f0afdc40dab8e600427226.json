Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) at a news conference. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nA torrent of impeachment developments has triggered a reckoning in the Republican Party, paralyzing many of its officeholders as they weigh their political futures, legacies and, ultimately, their allegiance to a president who has held them captive.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s moves to pressure a foreign power to target a domestic political rival have driven his party into a bunker, with lawmakers bracing for an extended battle led by a general whose orders are often confusing and contradictory.\n\nShould the House impeach Trump, his trial would be in the Senate, where the Republican majority would decide his fate. While GOP senators have engaged in hushed conversations about constitutional and moral considerations, their calculations at this point are almost entirely political.\n\nEven as polling shows an uptick in support nationally for Trump\u2019s impeachment, his command over the Republican base is uncontested, representing a stark warning to any official who dares to cross him.\n\n[Holding Ukraine hostage: How the president and his allies, chasing 2020 ammunition, fanned a political storm]\n\nAcross the country, most GOP lawmakers have responded to questions about Trump\u2019s conduct with varying degrees of silence, shrugged shoulders or pained defenses. For now, their collective strategy is simply to survive and not make any sudden moves.\n\nThis account of the anxiety gripping the Republicans Party is based on interviews with 21 lawmakers, aides and advisers, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nTrump has been defiant in his defense, insisting his conduct with foreign leaders has been \u201cperfect\u201d and claiming a broad conspiracy by the Democratic Party, the intelligence community and the national media to remove him from office. Yet few Republican lawmakers have been willing to fully parrot White House talking points because they believe they lack credibility or fret they could be contradicted by new discoveries.\n\n\u201cEveryone is getting a little shaky at this point,\u201d said Brendan Buck, who was counselor to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). \u201cMembers have gotten out on a limb with this president many times only to have it be cut off by the president. They know he\u2019s erratic, and this is a completely unsteady and developing situation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into President Trump has Senate Republicans making careful political calculations \u2014 most are simply trying to survive and not make any sudden moves. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nRepublican officials feel acute pressure beyond Trump. The president\u2019s allies on talk radio, Fox News Channel and elsewhere in conservative media have been abuzz with conspiratorial talk of a \u201cdeep state\u201d coup attempt and accusations that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and House Democrats are corrupting the impeachment process.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s paralysis was on display this past week in Templeton, Iowa, where a voter confronted Sen. Joni Ernst (R) at a town hall meeting Thursday over her silence about Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\n\u201cWhere is the line?\u201d Iowa resident Amy Haskins asked in frustration. \u201cWhen are you guys going to say, \u2018Enough,\u2019 and stand up and say, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m not backing any of this.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI can say, \u2018Yea, nay, whatever,\u2019 \u201d Ernst replied. \u201cThe president is going to say what the president is going to do.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Where is the line?\u2019: A Joni Ernst town hall questioner sums up the GOP\u2019s Trump dilemma]\n\nTrump\u2019s extraordinary public request that China investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden \u2014 adding to his previous pressure campaign on Ukraine \u2014 has sparked divergent reactions among other Republican senators, including over whether the president was being serious when he delivered his plea.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), the most outspoken of his colleagues, tweeted Friday: \u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) dismissed it as a joke. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a real request or him just needling the press, knowing that you guys were going to get outraged by it,\u201d Rubio told reporters.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump on Twitter swatted back at Romney by calling him \u201ca pompous \u2018ass\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning\u201d \u2014 a flashing signal to other Republicans that there would be consequences to speaking out against the president.\n\n\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) denounced President Trump\u2019s behavior, tweeting: \u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nSome House Republicans have tried to offer a more forceful defense than their Senate compatriots.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s shaky appearance last weekend on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d was widely panned, even among senior GOP aides, and raised questions about whether he was up to the task of protecting Trump. The California Republican falsely accused his interviewer, Scott Pelley, of misrepresenting a key phrase in the transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian president.\n\nBut some Trump aides privately said the president likes the messages sent by surrogates such as McCarthy and White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, who are willing to sit for a grilling and disparage the media, according to two Republicans close to the president.\n\n[Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders have long worried aides, leaving some \u2018genuinely horrified\u2019]\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), an informal Trump adviser, insisted the president had done \u201cnothing wrong\u201d and denounced those who act \u201cas if he\u2019s guilty until he\u2019s proven innocent.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Republicans to get weak, well, they have a very short memory,\u201d Meadows said, noting that his colleagues facing competitive primary races will need Trump\u2019s support.\n\nFormer Republican senator Jeff Flake, a Trump antagonist, said his former colleagues believe the foreign leader interactions under investigation in the House represent \u201cnew territory\u201d compared with past challenges, including the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cThere is a concern that he\u2019ll get through it and he\u2019ll exact revenge on those who didn\u2019t stand with him,\u201d Flake said. \u201cThere is no love for the president among Senate Republicans, and they aspire to do more than answer questions about his every tweet and issue. But they know this is the president\u2019s party and the bargain\u2019s been made.\u201d\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff. Trump\u2019s allies on talk radio, Fox News Channel and elsewhere in conservative media have been abuzz with conspiratorial talk of a \u201cdeep state\u201d coup attempt and a corruption of the impeachment process by House Democrats. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThe responses from most Republicans have infuriated and distressed Democrats, who consider Trump\u2019s conduct a brazen and unconstitutional abuse of power.\n\n\u201cMy Republican colleagues\u2019 silence seems unsustainable and inexcusable, given the threat to our national security as well as the integrity of our democratic institutions,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).\n\nThe frenetic reactions underscore how Republicans are navigating this moment on their own, without direction from the White House or clear guidance from the congressional leadership.\n\nMany Republicans also said in interviews last week that Trump\u2019s ability to nominate and confirm dozens of conservative federal judicial nominees and pass an overhaul of the tax code makes it harder to argue to their voters that he is now a burden on the party\u2019s policy agenda.\n\n[\u2018A presidency of one\u2019: Key federal agencies increasingly compelled to benefit Trump]\n\nThis is not the first such crossroads, of course. Republicans largely stood behind Trump in 2016 after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape on which he bragged of sexual assault, as well as during the darkest days of the Russia investigation and in the wake of racist comments.\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve been constantly moving the line,\u201d said Tom Rath, a GOP fixture in New Hampshire. \u201cWe say, \u2018Don\u2019t cross this line.\u2019 Okay, you crossed it. So, \u2018Don\u2019t cross this line.\u2019 We\u2019re finally at a point where patience is exhausted, reason is exhausted and, quite frankly, the voters are exhausted.\u201d\n\nA Republican strategist who is close with several senators and spoke on the condition of anonymity to share a candid assessment called the situation \u201ca disaster.\u201d This consultant has been advising clients to \u201csay as little as possible\u201d about impeachment developments to buy time.\n\n\n\nThe Capitol is seen reflected on an ambulance. (Sarah Silbiger for The Washington Post)\n\nSince last month\u2019s whistleblower complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry, 48 percent of Americans support impeachment and 46 percent oppose it, according to an average of polls analyzed by The Washington Post. Among Republicans, however, 11 percent support impeachment and 86 percent oppose it, the analysis found.\n\n\u201cThere just hasn\u2019t been pushback, and in part it\u2019s because of this perception that he\u2019s like Rasputin with the base with magic powers,\u201d said GOP consultant Mike Murphy, a Trump critic.\n\nFox News personality Tucker Carlson, who is admired by Trump and occasionally speaks with him, co-wrote an essay in the Daily Caller last week offering a road map for Republicans, writing that \u201cthere\u2019s no way to spin\u201d Trump\u2019s request that a foreign leader investigate one of his domestic opponents as proper, but that it did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.\n\n[Staring down impeachment, Trump sees himself as a victim of historic proportions]\n\nVeteran party figures said a true break with Trump is possible, but could take months, if not years. Senate Republicans are taking their cues from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a taciturn operator who has labored to maintain an uneasy but transactional relationship with Trump.\n\nThough a loyal Republican, McConnell has a history of expressing public concern with an embattled president in his own party. In 1973, McConnell, then a budding Kentucky politician, called the Watergate affair \u201ctotally repugnant\u201d and denounced the conduct of President Richard Nixon and some in his administration, as documented by McConnell biographer John David Dyche.\n\n\n\nDespite anxiety from Senate Republicans, Trump has been defiant in his defense, insisting his conduct with foreign leaders has been \u201cperfect.\u201d (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nOther than Romney and Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who also has criticized Trump\u2019s conduct with Ukrainian and Chinese counterparts, others who might break with the president include Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is retiring next year, and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina, according to two top Republicans in close touch with senators.\n\nStill, many more Republicans would have to join them to reach the two-thirds majority in the upper chamber required to convict the president and remove him from office.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to be the zebra that strays from the pack and gets gobbled up by the lion,\u201d a former senior administration official said in assessing the current consensus among Senate Republicans. \u201cThey have to hold hands and jump simultaneously. . . . Then Trump is immediately no longer president and the power he can exert over them and the punishment he can inflict is, in the snap of a finger, almost completely erased.\u201d\n\nYet with Washington as polarized as at any time in recent history, political winds may not blow strongly enough. As long as impeachment is a Democratic priority driven by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), it will be difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 for Senate Republicans to get on board, argued Alex Castellanos, a longtime GOP strategist.\n\n\u201cThe more passions swell in Pelosi\u2019s world, the more McConnell will deflate them,\u201d Castellanos said. Impeachment proceedings, he predicted, will be \u201can overhyped movie with an unsatisfying end.\u201d\n\nRachael Bade and Emily Guskin contributed to this report.", "description": "The GOP is paralyzed as lawmakers weigh their political futures, their legacies and their allegiance to a president who has held them captive.", "authors": ["Robert Costa", "National Political Reporter Covering The White House", "Congress", "Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/j0Ui01J3Qf3iMMslLFBvnpwqsoo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SIMPUCW67EI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
