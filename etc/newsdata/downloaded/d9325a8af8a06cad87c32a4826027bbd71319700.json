They welded a metal cylinder to a stand and packed it with gunpowder that they thought would send the coloured baby powder aloft. But authorities say tape covering the top of the cylinder caused it to detonate like a pipe bomb.\n\nLaw enforcement officials expressed condolences to the family and warned about the dangers of using explosive materials.\n\nWoman killed in explosion at Iowa gender-reveal party Read more\n\n\u201cThis family got together for what they thought was going to be a happy event with no intent for anyone to get hurt,\u201d Sheriff Jason Sandholdt said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhat ended up happening was that Pamela Kreimeyer, a wife, mother and grandmother, was killed by a piece of metal where a metal stand, gunpowder and coloured powder were involved. This is a reminder that anytime someone mixes these things there is a high potential for serious injury or death.\u201d\n\nUsing explosives to reveal a baby\u2019s gender is rare, but a similar incident caused a major wildfire in Arizona in 2017, when an off-duty border patrol agent accidentally set off a blaze that burned 189 sq km (73 sq miles) of mostly Forest Service land.\n\nThe blaze forced about 200 people out of their homes and cost an estimated $8m in damage and firefighting expenses. The agent, Dennis Dickey, fired a rifle at a homemade target that exploded, sending a blue substance into the air. The explosion started a grassfire that spread quickly.\n\nDickey pleaded guilty in September 2018 to a federal misdemeanour charge of starting a fire without a permit. He was sentenced the following month to five years of probation and was ordered to make an initial payment of $100,000 in restitution and monthly payments of $500.\n\n", "description": "Iowa police say event went wrong when cylinder containing gunpowder was taped over, causing it to explode", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c646f7b17ed234f425924d89c94f4fc34554a430/0_0_3898_2340/master/3898.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c9659e857c56aa7cc18d82f05dcad040", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
