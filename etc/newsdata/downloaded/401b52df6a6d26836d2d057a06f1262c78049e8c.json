No, it's not careening out of control.\n\nBut we'll forgive you if you're a little unnerved at first.\n\nTesla owners have flooded social media with videos depicting the newest feature of their cars: the ability to use their phones to tell their cars to drive themselves from parking spots to the curb, where the owner is standing.\n\nCalled \"Smart Summon,\" the feature is part of Tesla's 10.0 software update, which is delivered wirelessly. It's available to Tesla owners who paid for what the company calls \"full self-driving capability\" or \"enhanced Autopilot.\"\n\nThe car needs to be \"within their line of sight,\" Tesla said, and owners \"must remain responsible for the car and monitor it and its surroundings at all times.\" It also only works in private parking lots.\n\nTesla V10.0 car software update: Smart Summon, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and Spotify added to Tesla vehicles\n\nIIHS safety award for Tesla Model 3: It's 'a very safe car,\" IIHS says\n\n\"It\u2019s the perfect feature to use if you have an overflowing shopping cart, are dealing with a fussy child, or simply don\u2019t want to walk to your car through the rain,\" the company said.\n\nVideos show numerous examples of Teslas seamlessly driving themselves to their owners, albeit at a very slow pace.\n\nOhhh!
