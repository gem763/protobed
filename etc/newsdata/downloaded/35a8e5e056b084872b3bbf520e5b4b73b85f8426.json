It\u2019s really good for me.\u201d\n\nLampard has spoken recently about why Pulisic has been in and out of the side, but has also communicated to his player that he has his manager\u2019s complete backing.\n\n\u201cHe [Lampard] believes in me and he\u2019s told me that. You have to keep working hard in training and earn your spot, that\u2019s how it is at the highest level. I\u2019m going to continue to do so. This is hopefully just the start.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here expecting everything to be easy and have an easy route and start every game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always that easy. So I came in had to work for my spot just like everyone does.
