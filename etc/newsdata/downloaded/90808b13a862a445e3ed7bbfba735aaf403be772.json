He\u2019s been helping put together some key policies for a couple of candidates; I\u2019ve been asking him for tips every so often, as well as contacts close to other strategists. We were having a perfectly amiable discussion about which contender for the president was probably going to triumph in the primaries when he suddenly went quiet.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, and he leaned over and said to me in a low voice: \u201cI\u2019ve just spotted the only man in America wearing a Tulsi Gabbard hat.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI turned around and there it was, an undeniable campaign hat for \u201cTULSI 2020\u201d perched on the head of a middle-aged businessman wearing tweed. It was a strange thing to see. There are candidates who have cult-like followings already \u2013 Bernie Sanders, whose followers have turned up to his rallies in their droves since before 2016; Elizabeth Warren, whose selfie line in New York City took four hours to get to the front of; even Andrew Yang, whose backers turn up during debates holding signs saying \u201cMath\u201d (Make America Think Again) \u2013 but Tulsi Gabbard isn\u2019t one of them. She\u2019s a strange candidate, one whose views don\u2019t seem particularly socially or fiscally liberal, and who almost didn\u2019t turn up to take her place on the Democratic debate stage last week because she believed the process was \u201crigged\u201d and the media was against her. She speaks little about policy, except for one: the need for America to pull out of conflict zones generally \u2013 and Syria specifically. The fact that this is the only policy she usually talks about has led people to openly speculate that she\u2019s an apologist, or even a puppet, for Bashar al-Assad or Vladimir Putin. It\u2019s not the best PR you could have in an election where Americans are still reeling from accusations of Russian interference three years before.\n\nBut back to the hat.\n\nPolitical merchandise is a whole phenomenon in the US. Where particularly engaged Brits might put a \u201cLabour\u201d sticker on the front window of their sitting room, Americans will walk around with their loyalties literally emblazoned on their chests \u2013 whether or not their chosen candidate is actually standing in an election. Weeks ago, I saw a man walking through Brooklyn with \u201cBOOT-edge-edge\u201d written on his T-shirt; it was a somewhat obscure reference to Pete Buttigieg, the Indiana mayor who is standing for president and whose surname barely anyone can pronounce. His Twitter profile has \u201cBOOT-edge-edge\u201d at the end of it. As a journalist who has to know those sorts of things for work, I understood the T-shirt. I wondered how many other people in the chicken restaurant we were standing in did.\n\nTrump\u2019s online merchandise store \u2013 or \u201cthe Maga collection\u201d, as it styles itself, a la fashion houses \u2013 pumps out new clothing and accessories like there\u2019s no tomorrow. At the moment, you can buy a seasonably spooky pumpkin-themed hat for Halloween with \u201cKEEP AMERICA GREAT\u201d written on the back, as well as a \u201cWHERE\u2019S HUNTER?\u201d T-shirt which references Hunter Biden, the son of Democrat frontrunner Joe whose business dealings in Ukraine have been the subject of many a Trump speech lately. You can get a limited edition fine art poster of The Donald jumping out the White House like a superhero, and a pair of beverage coolers or a mug with the words \u201cWITCH HUNT!\u201d on them. And then there are the infamous plastic straws, unveiled a few months ago in a bizarre move to poke fun at \u201cliberal paper straws\u201d when single-use plastics and their contribution to climate change were in the news.\n\nThe official Tulsi Gabbard shop doesn\u2019t offer caps like the one I saw the man in the coffee shop wearing today, which only makes the whole episode more intriguing. Was he, as my fellow coffee drinker suspected, her campaign manager? Did he fashion his own hat in his spare time after being unusually moved by her platform of extending Medicare and pulling out of unnecessary wars? Is he doing it ironically?\n\nWe may never know the answer, but I can tell you one thing: it\u2019s inspired me to seek some political merchandise out for myself. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are my favourite candidates so far, so I might treat myself to a tote bag stating \u201cI\u2019M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BECAUSE THAT\u2019S WHAT GIRLS DO\u201d or a Greg Auerbach poster of Bernie standing outside the White House, holding a placard which reads \u201cWE ALL DESERVE A FUTURE\u201d. It\u2019s going to be a historic election, so maybe I\u2019ll get them all.", "description": "On Monday this week, I met with a contact in the Democratic Party at a coffee shop near Union Square in Manhattan to talk about the 2020 election.
