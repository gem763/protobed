But together, the fundraising numbers illustrate the financial strength of the Democratic party\u2019s most progressive wing and a rejection of more traditional approaches to pressing donors for money.\n\nThe White House hopefuls who have relied on frequent high-dollar fundraisers reported numbers that lag behind Sanders and Warren. Former vice-president Joe Biden said Thursday he raised $15.2m during the third quarter. Senator Kamala Harris of California reported $11.6m during the same period. Pete Buttigieg, who has combined small donors with traditional fundraisers, raised $19.1m.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s on fire\u2019: Elizabeth Warren on the rise \u2013 but has work to do to win black voters Read more\n\n\u201cThis means our grassroots movement is in an incredible position \u2013 to double down on our investments in grassroots organizing, to keep getting Elizabeth\u2019s plans for big, structural change in front of more caucus-goers and voters, and to bring more people into this fight,\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign said in a statement.\n\nWarren and Sanders have consistently attracted armies of small donors, many of whom contribute online. Warren\u2019s campaign said its quarterly totals came from 509,000 donors offering 943,000 donations. Her campaign has $25.7m cash on hand.\n\n\u201cProgressive politics are winning politics, period,\u201d Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the not-for-profit Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement praising both Warren and Sanders\u2019 fundraising prowess. \u201cThey are clearly the strongest, most electable candidates.\u201d\n\nAfter a sometimes rocky start to her campaign at the beginning of the year, Warren is in a close race for first place with Biden, according to several polls of voters nationally and in key early states. She has surpassed Sanders in many of these surveys.\n\nTrump announces record campaign haul amid impeachment inquiry Read more\n\nWarren has argued that by shunning big-dollar fundraisers and large donations, she has had more time for things like staying hours after rallies to take \u201cselfies\u201d with thousands of attendees. She has drawn huge crowds lately \u2013 including on Thursday night in San Diego, when the campaign estimated that 8,500 people thronged a grassy, downtown park off the Pacific Ocean to cheer her plans for a \u201cwealth tax\u201d on the fortunes of the richest Americans and vows to break up powerful banks and tech giants like Facebook.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses that kick off the presidential nomination process are now less than three months away \u2013 meaning all campaigns are under pressure to show they can excite both donors and would-be voters and seize momentum. Warren says she\u2019s doing both.\n\nStill, the ultimate Democratic nominee would face a formidable opponent in President Donald Trump who, in partnership with the Republican National Committee, raised $125m during the third quarter.", "description": "Fellow progressive Democrat Sanders raises $25.4m while Donald Trump amassed $125m over same period", "authors": ["Associated Press In San Diego"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e3b9f687cf27efd481739c2f6d51a0fac92a091/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c8d18b5267e7980890c54487d5cdf0eb", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
