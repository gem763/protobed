But what will happen and will it make any difference to Brexit?\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with parliament on Wednesday?\n\nThe president of the UK\u2019s highest court, Lady Hale, announced on Tuesday that \u201cparliament has not been prorogued\u201d. The unanimous judgment of all 11 justices was that it was for parliament - and particularly the speakers of both houses - to decide what to do next. Commons Speaker John Bercow has already said that parliament must be reconvened as a \u201cmatter of urgency\u201d and that MPs will sit at 11.30am. The usual Wednesday session of prime minister\u2019s questions would not take place, he said, although there would be opportunities for MPs to hold the Government to account.\n\nSo if there\u2019s no PMQs, will Johnson have to face questions at the dispatch box?\n\nJeremy Corbyn brought forward his party conference speech to Tuesday afternoon so he could be back in Westminster by Wednesday, presumably hoping to drive home Johnson\u2019s discomfort across the floor of the Commons. But it was not clear whether the PM would be there. A government official in New York with the prime minister said on Tuesday night that it was impossible to say whether Johnson would appear before the Commons. \u201cI would anticipate there would be statements to the house, I\u2019m just not in a position to say what they will be on,\u201d the official said.\n\nBoris Johnson flies back to face MPs' fury after court ruling Read more\n\nWhat does it mean for Brexit?\n\nCorbyn was meeting the leaders of the Scottish Nationalists, Lib Dems and other opposition parties last night to work out how to exert maximum pressure to achieve their number one goal: making sure Johnson cannot escape the legal obligation set out in the Benn-Burt bill to delay Brexit if he has not reached a deal of any description by 19 October. Johnson has always insisted he will not request an extension of article 50 and may be hoping that the EU summit on 17 October will provide a breakthrough.\n\nGovernment ministers have repeatedly dodged questions about whether they think there are loopholes they could use to avoid complying with the Benn legislation. But it would risk another potentially humiliating legal battle with the courts if Johnson chose to go down that route. In a hint he could have another go at suspending parliament he said there was a \u201cgood case for getting on with a Queen\u2019s speech\u201d.\n\nDoes any of this make an election more likely?\n\nJohnson would like to have an election as soon as possible, but he has failed to force the necessary legal instrument through parliament. As he put it, \u201cwe have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to have an election\u201d. The opposition parties don\u2019t want an election until Johnson has asked for the Brexit extension. Their calculation is that Johnson will be weakened by doing so because he has made delivering Brexit on 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d the totem of his prime ministership. They can therefore go to the country portraying him as someone who has failed to deliver his promises.\n\nIsn\u2019t Tory conference next week?\n\nJohnson\u2019s party is expected to gather in Manchester from Sunday for four days, but it is unclear whether the Commons will still be sitting - meaning MPs will be required in Westminster. The government is expected to table a motion to secure a short conference recess. If MPs reject this, then the conference would go ahead while parliament sits, adding to the sense of chaos. Party chairman, James Cleverly, said on Tuesday that \u201cof course\u201d the conference - which the Tories hope to use to make a string of pre-election announcements - would go ahead.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Boris Johnson will arrive back in the UK to face anger after the supreme court ruled prorogation was unlawful", "authors": ["Martin Farrer"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82a4e9694f98c475c7ed40f044250fedfc440498/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=de45aef13df9d16608405665d46c6cf3", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
