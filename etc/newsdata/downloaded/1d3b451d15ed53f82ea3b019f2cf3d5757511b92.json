But most people leave public-speaking prep to the last minute, she said, raising the risk of \u201cweaker presentations and diminished confidence.\u201d\n\nUnprepared or nervous speakers tend to talk too fast or in a slow monotone, lose their train of thought, or rely too heavily on jargon or information already conveyed in slides, said Stacey Shipman, a public speaking coach and facilitator at Massachusetts-based company Engage the Room. That can lead to colleagues or customers staring at their phones during meetings, she said.\n\nKirk Koenigsbauer, corporate vice president in Microsoft\u2019s Office division, said its digital presentation coach is designed to tackle these and other issues.\n\nAs the user rehearses a presentation by speaking into a desktop, laptop or smartphone microphone, the new tool can provide real-time feedback on pacing, word choice, language tics such as \u201cum\u201d and \u201canyway.\u201d When the speaker is finished, it generates an instant report suggesting areas for improvement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s listening to speech and analyzing the words,\u201d using AI-powered voice-recognition software to convert speech to text and search a database of flagged terms and best practices, Mr. Koenigsbauer said. The database is fine-tuned as users revise or ignore the tool\u2019s suggestions, he added.\n\nOther features in Microsoft\u2019s suite of business apps, such as slideshow, spreadsheet and videoconferencing tools, include AI components to help presenters convey complex business data visually\u2014and grab the attention of their listeners, Mr. Koenigsbauer said.\n\nThe sheer amount of that data can present its own problems.\n\nVijay Khanna, chief corporate development officer at robotic software maker UiPath Inc., said preparing for meetings today involves logging into various systems, copying and pasting numbers into a centralized repository, and generating figures to visualize cobbled-together data. \u201cThis can be incredibly tedious and manual work,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Khanna said robotic process automation can perform such tasks more quickly and with fewer errors, freeing up time for workers to focus on insights that drive business decisions.\n\n\u201cOne of the key pain points is turning data into a human-friendly narrative, suitable for normal people,\u201d said Colin Priest, vice president of AI strategy at DataRobot Inc., a technology firm that develops software applications that help translate complex AI-generated data into information that business-side executives can understand and act on.\n\nMany business executives don\u2019t know how to interpret numeric results, Mr. Priest said. At the same time, many tech workers struggle to explain data in nontechnical terms, making for drawn-out meetings with little or no value for corporate decision makers, he added.\n\nLikewise, Amy Chang, senior vice president of Cisco Systems Inc.\u2019s collaboration technology group, said the company in recent years introduced smart technology to help meetings be more engaging and productive.\n\nThis includes tools that can identify meeting attendees through AI-enabled facial-recognition capabilities, automatically scour the internet for biographical information and instantly convey it to the meeting host by email or text. The goal is to give the presenter a \u201cbetter sense of the room,\u201d Ms. Chang said.\n\nCisco has developed other digital assistants designed to take over mundane tasks associated with meetings. They include robotic software apps that can take notes, add items to corporate calendars as they come up, and track down follow-up contact information with other meeting attendees, among other routine jobs that used to be left to an office assistant.\n\nMany of these capabilities fall under the broader scope of digital workplace efforts, a strategy underpinned by smart tools and robotic process automation technology that seeks to automate manual office tasks.\n\nGlobal spending on these efforts climbed to $680 million last year, up 57% from 2017, and it is on pace to reach $2.4 billion by 2022, according to enterprise tech research firm Gartner Inc. It estimates that roughly 60% of companies world-wide with more than $1 billion in annual revenue are using some form of the technology, and more than 80% will adopt it within the next three years.\n\n\u201cMost enterprises are in the early innings of their automation journeys,\u201d Mr. Khanna said. But over the next five years, he added, \u201cit won\u2019t be about simple, repetitive tasks anymore, but rather about using automation to better understand and optimize the business processes,\u201d including daily meetings.\n\nWrite to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com", "description": "Companies are turning to robot speech coaches and slideshow designers to give meetings more pizazz.", "authors": ["Angus Loten", "Angus.Loten Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111449/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
