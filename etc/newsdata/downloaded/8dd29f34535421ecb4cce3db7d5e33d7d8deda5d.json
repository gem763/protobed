Slowly, over the last few years, more and more designers have been incorporating corduroy \u2014 most associated with a retro-'70s aesthetic, and last widely popular in the mid '90s \u2014 into their runway collections. Then, a handful of street style stars and celebrities started to embrace the textured fabric, putting fresh spins on a once-tired textile.\n\nAnd now, it seems like retailers at multiple price points are betting big on corduroy, offering a wide selection of styles and colours on their fall fashion line-up. In short: It's never been easier, or more tempting, to add a splash of modern corduroy into your wardrobe.\n\nHere are five ways to wear the trend that feel new, and not retro-tinged.\n\nSuper-sized\n\nThe ridges on the surface of corduroy (the vertical ones that makes it look distinct from velvet) are referred to as wales. It's measured in a per-inch basis, where a higher number means a finer cord; 11 wales per inch is standard, but some fabrics can be 4-wale. Wide wale corduroy, which also tends to be thicker and more substantive, is a fun, more casual way to wear the look this season.\n\nThe Group by Babaton Graydon Jacket, $148, Aritzia\n\nTwik Corduroy Mock-Neck Sweater, $39, Simons\n\nSuit up\n\nCute corduroy trousers \u2014 both cropped and wide-legged \u2014 are always a good khaki or denim substitute. But why not double your impact by wearing a corduroy suit (or perfectly-matching shirt and pant combo)? In an eye-catching colour and relaxed fit, a textured set can impart plenty of sartorial attitude even when styled with a plain t-shirt or basic turtleneck. And, you could always wear each piece solo as well.\n\nOak + Fort Jacket 3904, $88, and Skirt 3818, $58, Oak + Fort\n\nHilary MacMillan Corduroy Long Blazer, $225, and High Waisted Pants, $175, Hilary MacMillan\n\nJ.Crew Parke Blazer, $289, and Stovepipe Pant, $175, J.Crew\n\nJump start\n\nJumpsuits and coveralls continue to be popular this season. Made in colourful, medium-weight corduroy, they're equal parts durable and stylish. If you already have a pair in a denim or twill fabric, consider a fine-wale version a great way to update the utilitarian trend for fall.\n\nH&M Corduroy Overall, $69.99, H&M\n\nMissguided Cord Utility Jumpsuit, $73, Missguided\n\nPastel vision\n\nNeon-bright corduroys are also trending, but there's something more joyful (and not too youthful) about the prettier pastel and creamy-neutral hues, which are also easier to incorporate into many everyday wardrobes. In short: it's time to look beyond black, navy and brown when it comes to corduroy fashion.\n\nOld Navy Plus-Size Snap-Front No-Peek Corduroy Tunic, $42.99, Old Navy\n\nUniqlo High Waisted Corduroy Wide Cropped Pants, $39.90, Uniqlo\n\n\n\nOuter limits\n\nA stylish corduroy trench or worker jacket is never a bad idea! But this season it's sporty, puffer jackets made in corduroy that are grabbing our attention in particular. From printed corduroy jackets to insulated-cotton coats, these matte, textured puffers simply look cozier and feel more appealingly tactile than your average nylon or polyester-blend outerwear fabric.\n\nMadewell Corduroy Puffer Jacket, $219.47, Nordstrom\n\nTwik Corduroy Puffer Jacket, $99, Simons\n\nTruc Nguyen is a Toronto-based writer, editor and stylist.
