Protests now regularly descend into chaos with activists throwing bricks and petrol bombs at police officers who fire water cannon and tear gas. Conflicts have also erupted between protesters and pro-Beijing supporters, affecting tourists and bystanders.\n\nConcern is increasing significantly among the city\u2019s police force \u2013 once dubbed Asia\u2019s finest \u2013 that officers will need to use lethal force to defend themselves or others.\n\nViolence has gotten \u201cto such a level, [the officers\u2019] greatest fear is that they might have to kill someone or that they might be killed themselves \u2013 it is really that critical,\u201d a top police commander told a group of foreign media on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe have been so restrained in the face of such violence; this pressure has become extremely dangerous.\u201c\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen this kind of widespread lawlessness in the whole of my career,\u201d the commander said. \u201cWe are getting more and more worried about the possibility of death.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, police officers have pulled their guns and fired warning shots into the air during chaotic clashes with protesters. Senior police officers have said that their threshold to draw a weapon is if an officer feels his or her life is in danger.\n\nProtests first broke out over an extradition bill that would have sent suspects to face trial in mainland China, where Communist Party control of the courts leads to a 99.9 per cent conviction rate.\n\nHong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam pledged a few weeks ago to formally withdraw the proposal, though activist demands have widened in nearly four months of unrest to include direct leadership elections, and an independent investigation into police handling of the protests.\n\nMs Lam hasn\u2019t agreed to further concessions, but will begin a series of public meetings next week in efforts to resolve the situation.\n\nPolice say that an independent inquiry now would frustrate their efforts to handle the protests.\n\n\u201cWe are still in the middle of a crisis,\u201d said the senior commander. \u201cYou really have to be sure that whatever measure you take now is helpful to the resolution of the situation, that you are not playing into the hands of people whose only objective is to undermine the police so this situation could get worse.\u201d\n\nSo far, police have arrested 1,474 people, aged 12 to 84, since street violence began in June. Of those, 207 people have been charged.\n\nA number of cases are ready to go to trial, and some are starting to have their first hearings, the senior commander said, suggesting that city courts could fast track court dates and grant less bail to support broader efforts to quell the violence.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how we\u2019re going to stop this without all the other institutions all playing their part,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have always been relying on that deterrent sentence that comes at the very end of the process.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong police warned on Friday that violence in the territory had escalated to a point where officers feared \u201cthey might have to kill someone\u201d, as anti-government protests entered their sixteenth consecutive weekend.\u00a0 Violence has risen steadily since the mass demonstrations kicked off in early June", "authors": ["Sophia Yan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7uqM1R4yzi5Owsk2loO9fw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/d1cfeaeb1d14cf88cf7db03372cd382a", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
