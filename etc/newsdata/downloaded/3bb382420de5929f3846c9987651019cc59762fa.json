Nearly everything\u2014from laptops to internet service to plane tickets\u2014was cheaper here than in Europe.\n\nTwenty years later, this is no longer the case. Internet service, cellphone plans, and plane tickets are now much cheaper in Europe and Asia than in the United States, and the price differences are staggering. In 2018, according to data gathered by the comparison site Cable, the average monthly cost of a broadband internet connection was $29 in Italy, $31 in France, $32 in South Korea, and $37 in Germany and Japan. The same connection cost $68 in the United States, putting the country on par with Madagascar, Honduras, and Swaziland. American households spend about $100 a month on cellphone services, the Consumer Expenditure Survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates. Households in France and Germany pay less than half of that, according to the economists Mara Faccio and Luigi Zingales.", "description": "The money issue: Starbucks\u2019 radical attempt to save the middle class, the financially savvy Millennial, underpaid NBA players, the neuroscience of generosity, where drug lords put their money, and more", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/issues/2015/06/02/2015_05_CoverRGB/original.jpg", "published_at": "2015-06-02"}
