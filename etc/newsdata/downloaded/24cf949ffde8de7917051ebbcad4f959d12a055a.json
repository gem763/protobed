He has held senior roles in the energy ministry for more than three decades and most recently was minister of state for energy affairs.\n\nDespite now getting the top role overseeing Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy portfolio, Prince Abdulaziz is not known to be close to Prince Mohammed, the king\u2019s most powerful son and heir to the throne.\n\nHis appointment marks the first time a Saudi prince from the ruling Al Saud family heads the important energy ministry.\n\nThe move comes as Brent crude oil BRNX19, +0.42% trades under $60 a barrel, well below the $80-$85 range that analysts say is needed to balance the Saudi budget.\n\nAl-Falih\u2019s position, from where he oversaw some 60% of the Saudi economy, had been diminished in recent days. It signaled a possible rift with the crown prince over his management of various issues, including reportedly moving too slowly in advancing Prince Mohammed\u2019s plan to sell shares in the state-owned oil company Aramco.\n\nAl-Falih was removed just days ago from his post as board chairman of Aramco, a company that he once ran as chief executive. Al-Falih\u2019s Cabinet portfolio was also curtailed last month when mining and industry were spun off from his purview into a new ministry, in an attempt to focus on more effectively attracting foreign direct investment into these sectors.\n\nAl-Falih\u2019s diminishing role had led to reports that he was out of favor with Prince Mohammed, who is pushing to diversify the Saudi economy away from its dependence on oil revenue.\n\nThe crown prince has struggled to attract foreign investors, which analysts say is key to diversifying the economy and creating millions of jobs for young Saudis entering the workforce.\n\nForeign investors were spooked by Prince Mohammed\u2019s purported anti-corruption crackdown in late 2017, where he oversaw the murky shakedown of senior royals and top Saudi businessmen detained in the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. Many have also shied away after the gruesome killing of Saudi critic and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Turkey last year by Saudi agents.\n\nStill, there\u2019s great buzz around the crown prince\u2019s plan to list as much as 5% of Aramco by 2020 or 2021, which would make it the world\u2019s biggest IPO ever. Saudi Arabia has not said where an international listing would happen.\n\nTo prepare for an initial public offering, Aramco replaced al-Falih as board chairman last week with finance-minded Yasir al-Rumayyan, distancing the company from the energy ministry. Al-Rumayyan is a close adviser to the crown prince and heads the Public Investment Fund, the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.\n\nAl-Falih, who\u2019d taken over the energy portfolio from longtime oil minister Ali al-Naimi, was tasked with playing a key role in Prince Mohammed\u2019s economic overhaul of the country. He expressed concern in January at an energy forum in Abu Dhabi over the \u201crange of volatility\u201d in oil prices seen over the past two to three years.\n\nTo keep oil prices from sliding even further, al-Falih led Saudi Arabia\u2019s curb on production in OPEC and the oil cartel\u2019s agreement with other major oil producers, like Russia, to cut production in past years. The major oil producers have agreed to curb production this year by 1.2 million barrels a day, with Saudi Arabia as the kingpin of OPEC shouldering the bulk of the cartel\u2019s cuts.\n\nAs energy minister, al-Falih faced challenging market conditions, including a boon in U.S. shale production and global trade tensions that created an environment of lower oil prices.\n\n\u201cI think he did the most he could, and I think Prince Abdulaziz will probably do something very similar with the same kind of results,\u201d said Robin Mills, CEO of Dubai-based energy consulting firm Qamar Energy.\n\nMills said Prince Abdulaziz will likely maintain the deal al-Falih struck with global oil producers to cut production, and not be able to increase them given the current market conditions.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz is a known figure among OPEC members and industry insiders. In 1985, while in his 20s, he became an adviser to the Saudi energy ministry before being named deputy oil minister and assistant oil minister. In 2017, he was appointed minister of state for energy affairs.", "description": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman replaced the country\u2019s energy minister with one of his own sons Sunday, naming Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman to one of the most...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ883_saudi0_ZG_20190908161536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
