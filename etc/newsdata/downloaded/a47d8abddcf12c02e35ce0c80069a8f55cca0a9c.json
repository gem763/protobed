Bob Inglis said in the lawsuit that the party\u2019s decision not to hold a presidential primary deprives him and other Republicans \u201cof the ability to vote for the candidate of their choice in South Carolina\u2019s famous (and particularly influential) \u2018First in the South\u2019 primary.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina is among at least four states that have canceled Republican primaries and caucuses next year in an effort to help smooth Trump\u2019s path to reelection. The move, taken last month in South Carolina by the state party\u2019s executive committee, is not unusual for the party of the White House incumbent seeking a second term. Doing so allows Trump to try to consolidate his support as Democrats work to winnow their large field of candidates.\n\nThe suit was filed in state court in Columbia on Inglis\u2019 behalf by The Protect Democracy Project, which calls itself a \u201cnonpartisan nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing American democracy from declining into a more authoritarian form of government.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Nikki Haley in 2010 \u2014 said he was taking part in the suit \u201cbecause the cancellation of the primary by a small handful of party insiders denied me \u2014 and every other South Carolina Republican \u2014 our voice in defining what the Republican Party is and who it supports.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s Republican Party said Tuesday that it doesn\u2019t not typically comment on lawsuits.\n\nChallengers have emerged to Trump, including former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford, a former congressman and governor from South Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe support and appreciate the filing of this lawsuit. Especially with Donald Trump\u2019s increasingly precarious position, Republicans everywhere deserve a choice as to their candidate in next year\u2019s election. South Carolina is no exception,\u201d Weld told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \u201cIt should never be the case that a handful of party leaders can arbitrarily silence voters and predetermine the outcome of a nominating process.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanford tweeted that news of the lawsuit \u201cwould make our Founding Fathers proud!\u201d adding, \u201cI believe the SC GOP Party got it wrong on this one.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit was first reported by The Post and Courier of Charleston.\n\nPrimary challenges to incumbents are rarely successful, and Trump\u2019s poll numbers among Republican voters have proved resilient. Nonetheless, Trump aides are looking to prevent a repeat of the convention discord that highlighted the electoral weaknesses of Presidents George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter in their failed reelection campaigns.\n\nSince last year, Trump\u2019s campaign has worked to monitor \u2014 and at times control \u2014 the process by which delegates to next year\u2019s Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, are selected. His campaign wants the convention to be a four-night \u201cinfomercial\u201d for Trump by sidelining the president\u2019s detractors within the party.\n\nThe effort is an acknowledgment that Trump hasn\u2019t cemented his grip on the GOP and might not coast to the nomination without some opposition. To that end, the campaign has worked over the past year to scuttle any attempts at a Trump challenge by party dissidents, mindful that a serious primary opponent could weaken Trump heading into the general election.\n\nIn January, the Republican National Committee voted to express its \u201cundivided support\u201d for Trump and his \u201ceffective presidency.\u201d\n\nIn years past, both Republicans and Democrats have cut state nominating contests when an incumbent president from their party ran for a second term. In 1984, South Carolina GOP leaders opted to call off their primary as President Ronald Reagan sought a second term. In 2004, the GOP again canceled the state\u2019s primary with leaders deciding instead to endorse President George W. Bush\u2019s reelection bid.\n\nThe South Carolina Democratic Party didn\u2019t hold presidential primaries in 1996 or in 2012, when Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were their incumbents.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Hunter Woodall in Manchester, N.H., contributed to this report.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A Republican former South Carolina congressman is part of a lawsuit filed Tuesday over the state's decision to cancel its GOP primary.", "authors": ["Meg Kinnard"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19274791672141.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
