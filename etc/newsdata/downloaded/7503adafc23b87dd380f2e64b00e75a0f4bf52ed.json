Jack Keane, a Fox News analyst, first met with Trump at the White House and showed him a map of oil fields in northern Syria that have been controlled by the U.S. and its Kurdish allies, two people familiar with the discussion told NBC News. Keane reportedly told Trump he feared Iran would take over the oil fields if U.S. troops were out of the picture.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA few days later, Keane was joined by Graham, an outspoken critic of Trump's Syria decision, and the two reportedly showed the president a map to demonstrate that almost 75 percent of the oil fields in Syria were in areas where troops were stationed. They told Trump that Iran could capture the oil fields in the absence of U.S. troops, four people familiar with the meeting told NBC.\n\nOne source said Trump appeared \u201cresigned\u201d to keeping a small amount of U.S. troops in the area.\n\nTrump has since indicated he will consider a plan to leave about 200 U.S. troops in Syria.\n\nAn official told the network that troops would not physically defend the oil fields if they stayed, but the fields were mentioned to help persuade the president to maintain a U.S. presence.\n\nAdministration officials have reportedly used maps before to explain to Trump the implications of certain foreign policy moves.\n\nThe president\u2019s decision to remove troops allowed Turkey to launch an offensive into Syria against the Kurds, longtime U.S. allies.\n\nBoth Keane and Graham have publicly criticized Trump\u2019s removal of troops, with the retired general calling the president\u2019s decision a \u201cstrategic blunder\u201d and the South Carolina Republican saying it could lead to a \u201ccomplete and utter national security disaster.\u201d\n\nKeane and a spokesman for Graham declined to comment to NBC News, and the White House did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a Graham's office, the White House and an assistant to Keane for comment.", "description": "Sen.
