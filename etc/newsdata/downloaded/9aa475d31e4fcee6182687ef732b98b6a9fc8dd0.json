There is no antidote or vaccine and the only known method to prevent the disease from spreading is a mass cull of affected livestock.\n\nInfected pigs were found in two towns near the Philippine capital, Manila, and authorities have culled more than 7,000 pigs within a one-kilometre (0.6-mile) radius, said the agriculture minister, William Dar.\n\nHe said the country was not facing an epidemic and urged Filipinos to continue eating pork, which is a critical market and accounts for 60% of meat consumption in the Philippines.\n\nThe Asian country is the world\u2019s eighth biggest pork producer by volume and its swine industry is estimated at 260bn pesos (\u00a34bn), according to the agriculture department.\n\nDar said 14 of 20 samples sent to a UK laboratory tested positive for African swine fever, but it would take a week to confirm how virulent the strain is.\n\nThe virus was first recorded in Rodriguez town, six miles east of Manila. Other undisclosed areas are being closely monitored for possible infection, he added.\n\n\u201cWe have never been in an epidemic, just to highlight that. We are responding to the increased number of deaths of pigs,\u201d Dar said.\n\nAuthorities suspect the swine fever cases stemmed from backyard hog raisers who feed pigs \u201cswill\u201d, leftover food scraps from hotels and restaurants.\n\nThe ministry added the virus could also be traced to smuggled frozen meat and returning overseas Filipino workers who brought back infected meat products.\n\nIn May, the UN\u2019s Food and Agricultural Organization said pork prices had risen by up to 50% both in China and on the Chicago futures exchange.", "description": "Infected pigs found in two towns near capital Manila, as country becomes latest to be hit by disease", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Manila"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38ef4daafd5bcbb82e3ff664688fa956a0fa6e55/0_341_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1378d865d57d3df2d2f4a10b69043e79", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
