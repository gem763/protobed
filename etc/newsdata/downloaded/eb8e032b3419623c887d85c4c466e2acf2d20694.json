Beauty advent calendars seem to have sprung up from nowhere, but nobody\u2019s complaining when you can wake up to a different lipstick every morning.\n\nTo find our top choice for 2019, our tester learnt from her beauty mistakes of Christmas past. While quantity can seem tempting, ideally we want 24 different products destined to become lifelong staples in our beauty routine.\n\nSimilarly, the bigger the products, the better \u2013 while a lot of mini products seems fun, the reality is that most find their homes at the bottom of your handbag. Eager to find our new favourite, we dove into the Christmas season early and opened hundreds of calendar doors to find the best on offer this year.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The galaxy-inspired calendar features the products to create two different makeup looks, including four full-size products. While there are only twelve days, quality is favoured over quantity \u2013 we especially loved the inclusion of eyes to mesmerise cream eyeshadow and Charlotte\u2019s cult-classic moisturiser, magic cream. The excessive glitter on the packaging also doesn\u2019t hurt, making a jaw-dropping addition to your Christmas decor.\n\nAvailable October 3\n\nCath Kidston advent calendar: \u00a340, Cath Kidston\u200b\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get much cuter than Cath Kidston\u2019s advent calendar. Decorated in a festive-rendition of its trademark illustrations, it contains everything you need to treat yourself over the season, with its contents ranging from body lotions and soaps to hand creams and bath bombs.

This year there are two different calendars to choose from, but our favourite is the 24 day calendar.

Every product is ideal for slipping into your bag for any last-minute beauty emergencies, and our tester\u2019s skin felt better than ever after just a few days.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Body Shop dream big this Christmas deluxe advent calendar: \u00a365, The Body Shop\n\nThe Body Shop has outdone itself this year, releasing three advent calendar options \u2013 original, deluxe and ultimate. While all three are impressive in their own right, our pick is the deluxe, which balances luxury with affordability. With 25 treats from the Body Shop\u2019s make-up, skincare and bath and body collections, there\u2019s also the addition of daily trivia behind each door to celebrate the achievements of brilliant women throughout history. Once the big day\u2019s come, you can also take each box and make it into your own Christmas village.

Anyone looking to elevate their skincare in 2020 is given the perfect introduction to a multi-step routine.

Eight full-size products and 16 deluxe minis promise to smooth, refine and hydrate your skin against the harsh winter weather, with our tester most excited about the inclusion of the brand\u2019s phytopeel exfoliating cream. It may not be the most Christmassy of the bunch, but a worthy investment for your skincare collection.\n\nAvailable October 1\n\nMorris and Co. mixed prints beauty advent calendar: \u00a340, John Lewis & Partners\n\nA selection of William Morris\u2019 most iconic prints decorate this calendar, which features a range of beauty favourites in three scents: golden lily, strawberry thief and library of prints.

The brand\u2019s own beauty line and cult classics like REN, This Works and L\u2019Occitane bulk out the 24 days, worth over \u00a3300 in total. It has a more affordable price point than most of its competitors, costing just \u00a340 when customers spend \u00a325 on anything but food. We\u2019d recommend this to skincare aficiendos in particular.\n\nAvailable October 31\n\nLatest in Beauty 24 days of LIBmas: \u00a365, Latest in Beauty\n\nBeauty subscription service Latest In Beauty has pulled out all the stops to celebrate \u201cLIBmas\u201d.

Big brand names like Chlo\u00e9, NYX and Dermalogica have contributed the best of their collections to this baby pink beauty, and you can expect an exciting offering from Tarte Cosmetics on the big day itself. While it\u2019s \u00a380 for non-subscribers, those who have already caught onto the thrill of monthly subscription boxes (basically advent calendars you don\u2019t have to wait until Christmas to open) can get it for a \u00a310 discount.\n\nAvailable for pre-order for subscribers, on sale September 27\n\nSpace NK the beauty anthology: \u00a3195, Space NK\n\nSpace NK launched its first advent calendar to mass hysteria in 2018, so it only makes sense that it\u2019s back and bigger than ever. This is an anthology of its best products, so expect luxuries from the likes of Hourglass, Kate Sommerville, Drunk Elephant and more. While this definitely lies on the luxe side of the pricing scale, everything inside is as premium as any Space NK store. Serious beauty fans will feel like a child on Christmas Day for the whole advent season.\n\nAvailable October 1\n\nThe verdict: Beauty advent calendars\n\nWhen it comes to value for money and the products on offer, Feelunique\u2019s 24 day beauty advent calendar is unbeatable. However, for a more luxe feel, we also loved Charlotte Tilbury\u2019s calendar, while Holland & Barrett\u2019s calendar is perfect for anyone on a budget.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
