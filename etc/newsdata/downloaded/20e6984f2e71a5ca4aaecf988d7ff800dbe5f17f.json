What I learned surprised and scared me, as I described in the resulting article, \u201cConfessions of a Car Salesman.\u201d\n\nSelling cars turned out to be the perfect training for my current job as a consumer advocate and autos editor for NerdWallet. While I posed as a \u201cgreen pea\u201d \u2014 the nickname for a beginner car salesperson \u2014 the sales managers freely revealed their secrets to me so that I would move the metal and, in turn, make money for them.\n\nHere are just a few of the things I learned and how you can safely navigate the car-buying process.\n\n1. Test-drive your car salesperson\n\nBelieve it or not, I felt sympathy for many of the salespeople I worked with. They face long hours, hostility from customers and constant pressure from managers who watch from \u201cthe tower,\u201d a raised platform overlooking the car lot. Later, as I used my insider knowledge to buy more than 100 cars for an automotive website, I met many honest, intelligent, helpful car salespeople. But the work of these \u201cgood apples\u201d was often spoiled by a rotten batch of uninformed sales stereotypes \u2014 not to mention some manipulative and even underhanded dealership managers.\n\nI like to tell people that they should test-drive car salespeople before they test-drive the car. Here are a few things to ask yourself: Are they informed about the cars they are selling? Do they listen well and respond to your questions? Will you feel comfortable negotiating with them?\n\n2. Check the \u2018book\u2019 value\n\nIt takes only a minute to look up the current market value of a car \u2014 and yet many shoppers wander onto the car lot without any idea of what they should pay. This one little data point would provide an amazing amount of protection. But as an undercover car salesman, I had to stand by and watch trusting, ordinary buyers overpay for their new cars.\n\nRelated: Why buying a 10-year-old car is a savvy move\n\nSo take a moment and check a pricing guide such as Edmunds or Kelley Blue Book for the current market value of the car you want. Bring this information with you, or download a pricing app to check prices on the fly.\n\n3. Don\u2019t be a monthly-payment buyer\n\n\u201cWhat kind of monthly payment are you folks looking for?\u201d This helpful-sounding question is the favorite trick of car salespeople everywhere. And if you answer, it can be a financial disaster for you. While it sounds like the salesperson is concerned about your budget, it\u2019s the opening gambit for a tactic called \u201cpacking payments.\u201d If the dealer can get you to negotiate a monthly payment rather than the purchase price of the car, it\u2019s easy to add in \u2014 or \u201cpack\u201d \u2014 extras and make you overpay.\n\nGetting a preapproved car loan and telling the salesperson you are a \u201ccash buyer\u201d is an easy way to deflect this trick.\n\n4. Be ready to walk\n\nYou could walk into a dealership and have the same high-pressure experience your father had when he bought cars decades ago. Or you could have a mellow, enjoyable shopping experience where you get a fair deal. There\u2019s such a range of sales styles and dealerships.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: The ultimate car-buying checklist\u2014for even the most experienced shopper\n\nI worked at a \u201cturnover house,\u201d meaning that if one salesperson wasn\u2019t making progress with a customer, the customer was turned over to a different salesperson. If that didn\u2019t work, they brought in a \u201ccloser\u201d \u2014 an overbearing, manipulative bully who was determined to make a deal at any cost.\n\nAlso read: Here\u2019s how to capitalize on the electric car revolution \u2014 without buying Tesla\u2019s stock\n\nIf you see these warning signs, if you get a bad vibe, if you don\u2019t like your salesperson, beat a hasty retreat \u2014 instead of going to war, go to another dealership. For example, the second dealership I worked at was very relaxed and didn\u2019t use closers. But high-pressure or relaxed, whichever type of car lot you find yourself on, never take anything at face value.\n\n5. Beware the finance manager\n\nWhile the salesperson negotiates the price of the car and pretends to be your best friend, the real damage is done after the customer is handed off to the finance and insurance manager. Also called the \u201cF&I guy,\u201d this salesperson assumes the air of a financial adviser, sort of like a friendly banker. But he or she is really there to build even more profit into the deal by inflating the interest rate on your loan and selling you extra products such as extended warranties and antitheft devices.\n\nBefore you go to the dealership, spend a few minutes being your own finance manager by using an auto loan calculator to set up your own deal. Bring these figures with you to the dealership and get the dealer to match or beat them.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "The secrets of salespeople and dealership managers are surprising and a little scary.", "authors": ["Philip Reed"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ780_nerd_c_ZG_20190905153319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
