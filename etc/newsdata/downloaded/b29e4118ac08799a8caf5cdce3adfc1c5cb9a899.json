For players, it was a great deal: $4.99 a month for interesting new releases from some of the most exciting game developers around. But there\u2019s another notable aspect of Apple Arcade beyond the scale and quality of the games. One of Apple\u2019s requirements is that titles on Arcade must be available in more than 14 languages, which opens up these experiences to often-ignored markets and languages. It might just have been the biggest launch in terms of supported languages in video game history.\n\nThe process of localizing for so many languages isn\u2019t necessarily a big deal for games that have minimal text, like a simple puzzle game, but it turned out to be a huge undertaking for the two-person team behind the charming detective game Tangle Tower. The game, developed by a four-person team led by brothers Tom and Adam Vian, has more than 40,000 words of in-game text, from character descriptions to the copious dialogue. The brothers had originally planned to localize the game into only a handful of languages \u2014 including English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Japanese \u2014 but, due to Apple\u2019s requirements, Tangle Tower ended up launching in 17 languages. The pair says it was worth the effort. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely worth the time and money if you can afford it,\u201d Adam tells The Verge.\n\nDevelopment on Tangle Tower actually started years ago, but it was put on pause when the small studio partnered with Nintendo on Snipperclips, an adorable puzzle game that was one of a small number of Switch launch titles. (\u201cWhen Nintendo says \u2018Come make a game with us,\u2019 you drop everything and do that,\u201d Tom says.) But once that game and its expansion launched, the pair turned their attention back to their detective game concept. The first steps into localizing were fairly rudimentary. \u201cI literally took Adam\u2019s [UK] English script, turned my Excel language to US English, and said \u2018Okay, tell me where there are spelling mistakes,\u2019\u201d Tom explains. But when they eventually got in touch with Apple about the possibility of bringing Tangle Tower to Arcade, the studio realized they needed some help.\n\nLuckily, Tom had received a cold email from a company called Universally Speaking, which specializes in video game localization. It\u2019s the kind of message he\u2019d typically ignore, but it happened to come at just the right time. \u201cIt was a very good cold email,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the translation is seen in context.\u201d\n\nThe localization process at Universally Speaking is split into two parts: localization and testing. First, someone translates the script. Then, a native speaker actually plays through the translated version of the game to make sure everything worked in context. This was an especially important aspect for a game like Tangle Tower where a mistranslated clue could leave players completely stuck. \u201cThis game is hard to localize because a) it\u2019s got a million words in it, and b) all of the words are really important to the story, which is also the gameplay, which is a mystery, which is delicate,\u201d Adam explains.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the translation is seen in context, and this is where linguistic quality assurance comes into place,\u201d says Idalina Taylor, head of localization and audio at Universally Speaking. \u201cPost-translation, the localized content is implemented in the build, and we then have another set of eyes to go through the translation to make sure that it is actually accurate when playing the game\u2026 All these sanity checks, together with contextualisation allow for the translation to flourish and help engaging further the players into the game, increasing player experience.\u201d\n\nThe process was then repeated for each included language. For the most part, the brothers weren\u2019t involved in the process at all, though there was an anonymous spreadsheet where localizers could ask any specific questions. This was reassuring in a way: when someone asked a very specific question, it meant they were at least paying close attention. In most cases, individual translators were able to come up with creative solutions for problems. For instance, at one point in the game, a detective comes across a giant dragonfly and says it\u2019s either one big dragonfly or a very small dragon. But in the French version, that joke didn\u2019t make sense because the French word for dragonfly, libellule, doesn\u2019t contain the word dragon. So the French localizer had to come up with a brand-new pun using the similar-sounding French word ombellule.\n\n\u201cI had no idea what the Russian script actually says.\u201d\n\nThis structure also meant that the game\u2019s developers were putting a lot of faith in the localizers. In fact, the brothers say they weren\u2019t entirely sure the translations were good until Tangle Tower actually launched. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading hundreds of reviews in Korean and Russian and German. I\u2019ve just been throwing them into Google Translate,\u201d says Adam. \u201cIt\u2019s been a way to find out for sure that, say, the Russian script for the game is actually pretty good because some Russian guy is saying, \u2018Oh my god, I love the story!\u2019 I had no idea what the Russian script actually says.\u201d\n\nTangle Tower\u2019s developers also had to make some changes to the game itself to accommodate the new languages. The text boxes had to accommodate right-to-left languages like Arabic, and the team had to track down fonts for different alphabets, including thousands of Chinese characters, that weren\u2019t prohibitively expensive. In fact, they needed two different fonts for each alphabet, which meant a lot of searching. There were also graphic elements that used English text that had to be changed; for instance, an early version of a treasure map featured a compass with NEWS, indicating the four cardinal directions. Those four letters wouldn\u2019t make sense for many users. \u201cYou really have to not lean into illustrated text or graphic text, or text that requires a shape of a letter to be part of a puzzle,\u201d Adam says.\n\nOne of the biggest problems was the important scenes in which the detectives use clues to construct sentences to determine what has happened. (See the above screenshot.) These are the moments when Tangle Tower really makes you feel like someone solving a mystery. \u201cThe trouble is a lot of languages do not share the same basic sentence structure that English uses,\u201d Taylor explains. \u201cThey\u2019ll put verbs at the end, or the subject needs to come after the object, where we would need to put it before, and things like that.\u201d Certain languages, including Korean, German, and Turkish, required the developers to reformat the text boxes to better suit their sentence structures.\n\nDespite the extensive time and effort that went into the localization, the brothers say that the process wasn\u2019t really that different from translating into a smaller number of languages \u2014 it was just a lot more expensive. (The pair wasn\u2019t able to discuss specifics on funding for the game, though it seems likely Apple contributed in some form.) That said, it has opened up a whole new audience for the game, one that will only grow larger when Tangle Tower launches on the Nintendo Switch and Steam next week. Those versions will support all of the same languages as the Apple Arcade release. It was something that was forced on the team as an Apple Arcade requirement, but the brothers also say that the experience will inform their future games, which are more likely to be available in a wider range of languages.\n\n\u201cWe know what it takes from start to finish,\u201d Tom says of the process, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t something we knew before.\u201d", "description": "Tangle Tower is a detective game for Apple Arcade with lots of text, which was translated into more than a dozen languages including Russian, German, and Arabic.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ON1qKcDkUGpCWDLH6rkuHgjz8M8=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19292326/ss_71f91f6608d659261243390fccb8bbf9e5e08f34.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
