Photo: Mark Sullivan/WireImage\n\nThe Carter brothers, Aaron and Nick, don\u2019t get along very well, but the Backstreet Boys singer said today on Twitter that the courts are about to get involved. Nick and his sister Angel are apparently seeking restraining orders against Aaron, who Nick says \u201charbors thoughts and intentions of killing my wife and unborn child.\u201d The tweet \u2014 which included the hashtags \u201cmentalhealth\u201d and \u201cguncontrol\u201d \u2014 comes about a week after Aaron went on a since-deleted Twitter spree calling out his brother for withholding his son from meeting Aaron and for apparently sensitive disclosures Nick made about the Carter family in his book. Below is the restraining order tweet from Nick.\n\nAaron responded with tweets of his own, saying he hadn\u2019t seen his older brother in four years and that they are now \u201cdone for life.\u201d Aaron also recently said on the show The Doctors that he is soon to inherit 500 guns from his deceased father, which might have something to do with Nick bringing up gun control with the restraining-order news.", "description": "Backstreet Boy Nick Carter says he and his sister Angel have filed for a restraining order against their brother, Aaron Carter.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/17-carters.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
