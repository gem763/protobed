Her absence has raised speculation that she may have given birth to another child.\n\nRi appeared in public six times during the first half of this year, starting with Kim's visit to China from Jan. 7-10. She was last seen by Kim's side during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Pyongyang on June 20-21, while Kim has continued to make high-profile public appearances, including a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in the border truce village of Panmunjom on June 30.\n\nRi was absent from an event marking the 25th anniversary of national founder Kim Il-sung's death on July 8, a concert commemorating the 66th anniversary of Armistice Day -- which North Korea calls \"Victory Day,\" when the two Koreas halted the 1950-53 war in a ceasefire agreement -- on July 27 and a ceremony observing the founding of the regime's Workers Party on Oct. 10.\n\nIt has been speculated that Ri went into hiding to give birth to a child. In 2016, she also disappeared from the public eye for some nine months amid rumors that she had given birth, but they have never been confirmed.\n\n", "description": "Public Absence of Kim Jong-un's Wife Fuels Childbirth Speculation", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/21/2019102100789_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
