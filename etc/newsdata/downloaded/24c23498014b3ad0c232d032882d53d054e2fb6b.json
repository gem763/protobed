Add Ethiopia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Ethiopia news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIn a parliamentary session on Tuesday Ahmed, 43, warned that he could get \u201cmillions readied\u201d if there was a need to go to war over a contested dam project, although he called for negotiations to resolve the situation.\n\n\u201cSome say things about use of force (by Egypt). It should be underlined that no force could stop Ethiopia from building a dam,\u201d the prime minister said, according to the Associated Press. \u201cIf there is a need to go to war, we could get millions readied. If some could fire a missile, others could use bombs. But that\u2019s not in the best interest of all of us.\u201d\n\nThe dispute revolves around the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Resistance Dam on Ethiopia\u2019s Blue Nile which, when complete, will be the largest dam in Africa. Egyptian authorities believe that the dam will restrict its access to the fresh waters of the river Nile. Negotiations between the African nations over how to resolve the dispute collapsed earlier this month .\n\nAhmed was awarded this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize \"for his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation, and in particular for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighboring Eritrea\u201d on Oct. 11.\n\nMulugeta Ayene/AP\n\nThe award of the prize earlier this month was also \u201cmeant to recognize all the stakeholders working for peace and reconciliation in Ethiopia and in the East and Northeast African regions,\" the committee said in a statement.\n\nThe prime minister also defended the decision of the Nobel Committee to award him the Peace Prize in the Ethiopian parliament, saying that those criticizing the award were \u201cwasting their time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome individuals are finding it hard to accept about the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d he said in parliament, according to the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s already given to Abiy, and it won\u2019t be taken away from him. That\u2019s it! This is a dead issue! Now our focus should be on how to motivate other youths to win the prize. People who continue to dwell on this are wasting their time.\u201d\n\nIn recent decades the Norwegian Nobel Committee has come under scrutiny for a number of controversial awards. In an interview with ABC News regarding last year\u2019s winners, Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad Henrik Urdal, the director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, told ABC News that Nobel Prize winners former U.S. President Barack Obama and Myanmar Prime Minister Aung San Suu Kyi were two such laureates.\n\n\"I think Barack Obama is a case where they jumped too early,\" he said. \"When it comes to Aung San Suu Kyi, she was awarded for something I think is worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize. But she hasn't lived up to the expectations afterward.\"", "description": "The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, prime minister Abiy Ahmed, says Ethiopia is 'readied' for war, 11 days after the award.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/Ethiopia-Prime-Minister-ap-ps-191022_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
