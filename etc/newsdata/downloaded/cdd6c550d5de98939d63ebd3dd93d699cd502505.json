The leak was later plugged, IRNA reported.\n\n\u201cThis latest incident, if confirmed to be an act of aggression, is highly likely to be part of the wider narrative of deteriorating relations between Saudi and the U.S. and Iran,\u201d according to an assessment provided to the Associated Press by private maritime security firm Dryad Maritime. \u201cIt is likely that the region, having been stable for the last month, will face another period of increasing maritime threats, as the Iranian and Saudi geopolitical stand-off continues.\u201d\n\nIRANIAN WOMEN ATTEND SOCCER GAME FOR FIRST TIME IN NEARLY 40 YEARS\n\nThe stricken vessel, identified by IRNA as the Sibiti, was carrying about 1 million barrels of crude oil when it was struck, an analysis from data firm Refinitiv showed.\n\nThe news agency did not say whom Iranian officials suspect may be responsible for launching the missiles.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi described the incident as an \"attack\" carried out by those committing \"dangerous adventurism.\" In a statement, Mousavi said the Sabiti was struck twice in the span of a half-hour and an investigation was underway.\n\nImages taken from the ship's bridge that have been released by Iran's Petroleum Ministry did not appear to show any damage to the Sabiti, though the view did not show the ship's sides. Satellite images of the area did not show any visible smoke.\n\nIRANIAN-FLAGGED OIL TANKER PREVIOUSLY SEIZED FOR VIOLATING EU SANCTIONS PICTURES OFF COAST OF SYRIA AGAIN\n\nThere has been no word from Saudi Arabia about the reported attack. Oil prices jumped by two percent after the news broke.\n\nAccording to the AP, the Sabiti turned on its tracking devices late Friday morning in the Red Sea. The last time the vessel had turned on its tracking devices was in August near the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas.\n\nIranian tankers routinely turn off their trackers due to U.S. sanctions that target the sale of Iran\u2019s crude oil.\n\nLt. Pete Pagano, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet overseeing the Mideast, said authorities there were \"aware of reports of this incident,\" but declined to comment further.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe reported attack comes after the U.S. has alleged that in past months Iran attacked oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, something denied by Tehran.\n\nFox News' Edmund DeMarche and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "An Iranian oil tanker cruising 60 miles off the coast of Saudi Arabia was rocked by a pair of\u00a0missiles Friday, briefly causing an oil leak and more broadly threatening to further inflame fraught\u00a0regional tensions between the two heavyweight Muslim nations.", "authors": ["Lucia Suarez Sang"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19284337997830.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
