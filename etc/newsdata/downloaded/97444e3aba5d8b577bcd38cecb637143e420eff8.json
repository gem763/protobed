It was not immediately clear what led to the change.\n\n\u201cUnipec offered U.S. cargoes that they\u2019ve already purchased to South Korean refiners after the U.S. new tariffs kicked in,\u201d another one of the sources said.\n\nThe very large crude carrier (VLCC) Dorra was chartered by Unipec and loaded U.S. crude last August and is now heading to the South Korean port of Yeosu, according to ship tracking data on Refinitiv Eikon. The VLCC is expected to discharge in mid-October.\n\nAnother VLCC carrying U.S. crude, the Kirkuk, changed its destination from China\u2019s Shandong port to India\u2019s Sikka on Aug. 31, one day before tariffs kicked in, according to Refinitiv shipping data.\n\nA shipping source said the Kirkuk is carrying WTI Midland crude for Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS) and is expected to arrive at Sikka by the end of September or early October.\n\nThe seller of the cargo is not immediately known.\n\nIndian refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp\u2019s (BPCL.NS) head of refineries R. Ramachandran told Reuters that a Chinese trader has offered a cargo of U.S. oil to the refiner after Beijing\u2019s latest tariff hike. But he declined to identify the seller.", "description": "China's Unipec is reselling some of the crude oil it imports from the United States to buyers in India and South Korea to avoid tariffs Beijing imposed in its trade war with the U.S., three sources with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Shu Zhang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
