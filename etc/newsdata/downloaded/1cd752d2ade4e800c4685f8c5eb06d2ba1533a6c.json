It\u2019s a popular alternative therapy for newborns, particularly those who have had a traumatic birth, are unsettled, or have trouble sleeping.\n\n\u2018It claims to heal, relax and promote sleep, digestion and body alignment through gentle head and body manipulation. While there is a lack of scientific evidence, after hearing positive things about it (and out of intrigue more than anything else), I took Arthur when he was seven months old.\n\n\u2018I was fascinated to see how calming it was for him, but also how valuable the feedback was. The osteopath noticed one side of his neck was tighter than the other, which explained why he favoured one side sleeping. She also saw that his arms were stronger than his legs, so she gave me an exercise to help him.\u2019\n\nThe treatment uses gentle, non-invasive techniques to gently manipulate the head and spine, which affects the whole body\n\nPippa added that the treatment could be used for mums, too, writing: \u2018It is an expense... but well worth it.\u2019\n\nShe quoted Kam Panesar from London Osteopathic Care, who said the treatment \u2018uses gentle, non-invasive techniques to gently manipulate the head and spine, which affects the whole body. It\u2019s gentle, soothing and great for helping babies relax.\u2019\n\nHowever sceptics have branded the treatment \u2018pseudo-science\u2019.", "description": "Pippa Middleton, (pictured left and walking baby Arthur inset), has embraced the bizarre therapy of 'cranial osteopathy' for her baby Arthur, and swears it's had physical benefits.", "authors": ["Ian Fletcher For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/23/20227564-0-image-a-7_1572127431740.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
