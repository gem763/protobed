There\u2019s not really anywhere else to go.\n\nInside student accommodation at Purbeck Court on the Frenchay campus at the University of West of England (UWE), Bristol (Picture: SWNS)\n\nStudents say the 8x10ft rooms are like \u2018shipping containers\u2019 (Picture: SWNS)\n\nThe pods have been branded \u2018not mentally viable\u2019 (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018At the time [I moved in] I was desperate for accommodation, but I was pretty appalled. I couldn\u2019t quite believe the prospect of spending a year there.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that it was \u2018not an appropriate living standard for a human being\u2019.\n\nOther complaints from students have include there being limited communal space, thin walls and being overlooked by an existing hall of residence.\n\nThe pods are costing residents \u00a3150 per week, whilst campus accommodation ranges from \u00a3111 to \u00a3183 per week.\n\nAnother student, Jack Fifield, said: \u2018They [the university] say it\u2019s a pilot scheme but they shouldn\u2019t be testing it on live students.\n\n\u2018They need to reduce the rent and retroactively refund them.\u2019\n\nThe new accommodation was built in a university car park (Picture: SWNS)\n\nThe new pods were built to address rising demand (Picture: SWNS)\n\nThe university has said it will be evaluating the value for money of the new units.\n\nIt has plans to build a range of 2,000 additional student rooms on the campus, which will be ready by 2022.\n\nA university spokesperson told the BBC the pods had been \u2018used successfully elsewhere, including student accommodation at other universities\u2019.\n\nThey added: \u2018We are working closely with the students living in this accommodation to respond to their feedback.\n\n\u2018This will be used to inform our future accommodation plans and to see whether the pilot may be extended beyond this academic year.\u2019\n\nThe university\u2019s vice chancellor, Steve West, has offered to meet with students living in the pods and said a new communal space will be added soon.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
