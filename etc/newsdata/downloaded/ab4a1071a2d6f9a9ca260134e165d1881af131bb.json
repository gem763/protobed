Collins, shown May 7 at the White House, overhauled the NIH Clinical Center leadership structure in 2016 after a review determined patient safety had become \u201csubservient to research demands.\u201d (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has temporarily removed four senior officials at the pharmacy that serves its world-renowned hospital and launched an inquiry into management and personnel issues in the often-troubled department.\n\nUnlike a leadership shake-up at the 200-bed Clinical Center that followed reports of contaminated drugs in 2015, this investigation does not appear to involve patient safety problems in the pharmacy, which prepares drugs for patients treated at the hospital. Rather, it focuses on complaints against managers and a difficult workplace culture.\n\nJames Gilman, who runs the Bethesda, Md., hospital, told pharmacy staff at a meeting Friday that the inquiry focuses on allegations of \u201cpotentially discriminatory and inappropriate conduct in the pharmacy,\u201d according to a recording of the meeting shared with The Washington Post.\n\nGilman acknowledged \u201cthis is a very serious step to take\u201d but stressed that no conclusions have been reached about the managers, including the head of the pharmacy, or other issues. He said he decided to sideline them so they could not influence the interviews that will be conducted with the entire pharmacy staff.\n\n\u201cThe issues are very clear,\u201d Gilman told the employees. \u201cWe have trouble keeping staff. Too many good people have left. Too many good people that we wanted to come didn\u2019t, because they\u2019re not sure it\u2019s a good place to work.\u201d\n\nGilman\u2019s office referred questions to the NIH communications office. An NIH spokeswoman declined to name the managers, or say how many were removed. In an email, she said \u201cthe Clinical Center is working through some individual personnel matters in the Pharmacy Department . . . The reviews are not related to clinical quality or safety. There will be no impact of this workplace situation on patient safety or quality of care, which are our highest priorities.\u201d\n\nGilman used the first names of all four managers during the meeting, and The Post was able to ascertain their roles.\n\nThe inquiry, which must be completed within 120 days, is being conducted by the NIH Civil Program, which is part of its Office of Human Resources. On its website, the Civil program urges employees to contact the program if they \u201cbecome aware of a workplace situation involving uncivil behavior, such as harassment, sexual harassment, inappropriate conduct, intimidation, bullying or other unproductive, disruptive, and/or violent behaviors.\u201d\n\nA second inquiry of the pharmacy appears to be underway, conducted by NIH\u2019s Office of Management Assessment. That unit \u201cprovides broad management oversight and advice to the NIH Director on program integrity, risk management, and management support systems,\u201d according to its website. The spokeswoman said she would neither confirm nor deny that review, but Gilman and staff discussed it at Friday\u2019s staff meeting.\n\n\u201cThe issues are not quite the same that they\u2019re addressing,\u201d Gilman said, \u201cbut they\u2019re not completely unrelated.\u201d\n\nThe Clinical Center, opened in 1953, is where many desperately ill people come to be treated with cutting-edge, experimental protocols conducted by NIH\u2019s on-campus health-care providers, who study them and healthy volunteers in their research. About 25 percent are cancer patients.\n\nIn 2016, NIH Director Francis Collins removed John Gallin, who had led the government hospital for 22 years, and replaced him with Gilman after a review determined patient safety had become \u201csubservient to research demands.\u201d Collins also overhauled the hospital\u2019s leadership structure.\n\nThe task force that found the safety problems was originally appointed to look into contamination of drugs in the Clinical Center. A whistleblower\u2019s complaint in 2015 triggered an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration that resulted in suspension of some drugmaking operations in the pharmacy.\n\nIn 2017, Collins wrote on his blog that NIH had spent about $50 million on \u201cimproving patient safety, a considerable amount of which has gone to much needed infrastructure improvements at the Clinical Center and aseptic manufacturing facilities.\u201d Renovations are continuing at the pharmacy, according to the spokeswoman.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s staff meeting, Gilman repeatedly drew sharp contrasts between the 2015 shake-up and the conflicts that prompted the current inquiry. \u201cThis is not \u2014 not \u2014 2015,\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cWe have made a lot of progress since 2015. This is not 2015, and don\u2019t you let anybody say that,\u201d he added.\n\nNevertheless, he acknowledged personnel problems and urged every employee to tell reviewers what they know.\n\n\u201cWe have to improve the workplace climate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to improve our ability to get along with each other. We have to improve our trust and respect for one another if we\u2019re going to keep going.\u201d\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nPatient safety issues prompt leadership shake-up at NIH hospital\n\nNIH suspends operation of drug unit after fungal contamination in vials", "description": "Four leaders of the department that provides drugs to NIH\u2019s 200-bed hospital have been temporarily reassigned.
