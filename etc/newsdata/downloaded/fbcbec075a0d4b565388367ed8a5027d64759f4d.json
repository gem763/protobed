Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who said she\u2019ll vote to back the $5 billion in new money, but will also vote for the rebuke over how Mr. Trump handled the money in the past.\n\nMs. Murkowski was one of a dozen Senate Republicans who voted with Democrats in March to overturn Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration of an emergency along the southern border and try to prevent him from tapping Pentagon funds to build new wall.\n\nThe Democrat-led House had also passed the resolution of disapproval in February, but neither chamber had the numbers to overturn Mr. Trump\u2019s veto.\n\nThat same scenario is likely to play out again after this week\u2019s vote \u2014 though Democrats say they have a stronger hand this time because they now have the list of military construction projects that are being halted so the money can be shifted to the border wall.\n\n\u201cMany of my Republican colleagues have military installations with major projects in their states that would suffer because of the president\u2019s emergency declaration,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer. \u201cThe president promised Mexico would pay for it. Sadly, it\u2019s our military and their families that seem to be paying for it.\u201d\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, Colorado Democrat, said Tuesday that the president is \u201cstealing\u201d money from a critical mission at Peterson Air Force base in Colorado Springs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an illustration of how much the Republican Party has actually the party of Donald Trump. But it\u2019s certainly not an illustration of how conservative these members of the Senate are,\u201d said Mr. Bennet, a 2020 presidential candidate.\n\nMr. Trump requested $5 billion in border wall money for 2019, but Congress approved just $1.375 billion. The president signed that bill, but turned around and declared the border emergency, tapping nearly $7 billion in additional money, most of it from the Pentagon, that he said could be used to build despite Congress\u2019s objections.\n\nMr. Trump has asked for another $5 billion for 2020, and that\u2019s the money the Senate Appropriations Committee is now debating. The money cleared the panel\u2019s Homeland Security subcommittee Tuesday, but Democrats vowed a bigger fight as the bill advances to the full committee later this week and to the Senate floor later.\n\nSen. Jon Tester of Montana, the ranking Democrat on that subcommittee, said he could support some of Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall request if he had more assurances that the money wasn\u2019t being wasted. As it stands, though, he said Homeland Security has no idea how it would spend the $5 billion.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot of damn money. I mean, it\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia Republican, said Homeland Security presented a lengthy justification for its border wall plans last year, delivering a thick volume of plans and an extensive briefing on how the money would be used.\n\n\u201cWith the $5 billion that\u2019s in this bill, this gets us through the top 17 in the high-priority areas,\u201d said Ms. Capito, who chairs the Homeland Security subcommittee.\n\nThe wall is one of the big sticking points as Congress tries to head off another government shutdown and fund operations for fiscal 2020. Without an agreement, funding will run out next Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday his chamber will take up a stopgap bill this week that would keep the government running through Nov. 21, putting off a final showdown over the border wall. The House passed the short-term bill last week.\n\nAnother point of contention in the broader debate is how endangered the Pentagon projects truly are, amid the warnings from Democrats such as Mr. Schumer and Mr. Bennet.\n\nWhen the Defense Department released the list of projects that could be affected earlier this month, officials said they might not even be delayed if Congress agreed to approve supplemental funding.\n\n\u201cIf Congress were to back-fill the projects none of the projects would be delayed,\u201d said Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Elaine McCusker. \u201cBut we do realize this could cause some delay. They\u2019re definitely not canceled.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats have rejected that idea.\n\n\u201cI say no back-filling is going to help unless we stop these raids\u201d on the military budget, said Sen. Tom Udall, New Mexico Democrat.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
