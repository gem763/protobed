Soon after, he was spotted limping down the runway at PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh and didn't return for the third period.\n\nThe play that sent Malkin to the dressing room.

Only 10 forwards available for this workout because of the Malkin and Bjugstad injuries. \u2014@MolinariPGH\n\nMalkin, with a goal in Pittsburgh's first two games, scored 21 goals and 72 points in 68 regular-season games last year.\n\nOnly once in the past six seasons has the three-time all-star played at least 75 games.\n\nAggressive trader\n\nWith Penguins forward Bryan Rust, who scored 18 goals last season, on long-term injured reserve, Pittsburgh general manager Jim Rutherford soon will have some salary cap space available.\n\nAggressive when it comes to deals, Rutherford might have a difficult time finding a trade partner willing to move an offensive centre, especially this early in the season.\n\nMalkin walked out to the bench in street clothes about 10 minutes before Monday's practice and, with two feet on the bench, stickhandled on the ice for less than a minute before returning to the dressing room.\n\nPittsburgh, with only 10 healthy forwards on Monday, were expected to summon two forwards from their American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre Scranton, Pa., before Tuesday's contest.
