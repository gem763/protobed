But here, we demonstrate the contrary \u2014 that is, we have found a gas giant planet orbiting a very low-mass star.\"\n\nThe researchers are continuing to monitor this system to learn more about its second potential world and perhaps even more planets, Morales said. Furthermore, they are examining another 300 or so red dwarfs to look for more exoplanets, he added.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "A giant, Jupiter-like planet has been discovered by astronomers in a unique place, orbiting a small red dwarf star.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/planet-found.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
