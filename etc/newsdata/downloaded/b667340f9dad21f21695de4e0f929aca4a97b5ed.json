Mitt Romney is trying to become the new Jeff Flake of the Republican Party, and Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press conference Thursday might have swayed a few others, at least in the House:\n\n.@GOP Rep. Francis Rooney not ruling out impeachment after Mulvaney\u2019s confession: \"I remember too many people saying, 'Oh, this is a witch hunt against Richard Nixon,' and come to find out it wasn't a witch hunt.\"https://t.co/CqM4AGkXBz \u2014 Jesse Lehrich (@JesseLehrich) October 17, 2019\n\nDespite the overheated chyrons at CNN, the needle on impeachment doesn\u2019t seem to have moved much at all, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the subject never even came up during President Trump\u2019s \u201cmeltdown\u201d at a meeting Wednesday.\n\nSo, where do Republican senators stand on Trump\u2019s impeachment? Allahpundit of Twitchy sister-site HotAir has the over/under at 2.5 \u2014 nowhere near enough to convict or remove from office, but a significant number nonetheless.\n\nOver/under on Senate Republican votes to remove Trump remains at 2.5 \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) October 17, 2019\n\nTakers?\n\nassuming sasse is the .5 \u2014 your pal andy (@andylevy) October 17, 2019\n\nHe\u2019ll cough up a reason to acquit. Probably \u201cbad but not impeachable.\u201d \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) October 17, 2019\n\n\"though the president's actions were perhaps regrettable, it is time to put aside partisan bickering and come together with the civility needed to vote to acquit\" \u2014 your pal andy (@andylevy) October 17, 2019\n\nHe\u2019ll find a way to blame Democrats too somehow \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) October 17, 2019\n\n\"certainly we all bear some responsibility for the erosion of civic virtues that has led us to this unfortunate occasion\" \u2014 your pal andy (@andylevy) October 17, 2019\n\nA lot of lip service will be paid to civic virtues while he\u2019s handing Trump his free pass on quid pro quos with foreign governments \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) October 17, 2019\n\ni will eat a shoe if the phrase \"this august body\" isn't in there \u2014 your pal andy (@andylevy) October 17, 2019\n\nWhere can I get in on this action!!!!! \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) October 17, 2019\n\nYou\u2019re taking the over? \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) October 17, 2019\n\nI am maxing out the under pic.twitter.com/OYvFOPzire \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) October 17, 2019\n\nI think there\u2019s a fair chance Romney and Murky each vote to remove, which puts us right on the brink \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) October 17, 2019\n\nCollins will vote to remove. She needs to to have any shot of winning her race. Her problem is the general, not the primary. \u2014 Matt (@Emptyset09) October 17, 2019\n\nSo many people in the replies here unaware that that the Maine senatorial primary is in June, and the filing deadline is in March. Susan Collins might as well announce her retirement if she votes to remove Trump. There won't be a majority for conviction. https://t.co/AJRxzvZScr \u2014 Varad Mehta (@varadmehta) October 17, 2019\n\nI think Romney and Murky might break. Would be shocked if anyone else did. Burr might be the best chance. \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) October 17, 2019\n\nThose are retirement announcements. And if there's a majority for conviction, the entire GOP caucus will pay. I doubt the'y'd let that happen. \u2014 Varad Mehta (@varadmehta) October 17, 2019\n\nRomney votes to convict and he's poison the rest of his time in the Senate. No R would dare work with him. He'd be untouchable. If he's willing to throw away his effectiveness, more power to him, I guess. \u2014 Varad Mehta (@varadmehta) October 17, 2019\n\nAre we counting Romney as 1/2 Republican? \ud83d\ude42 \u2014 Dale Betterton (@DaleBetterton) October 17, 2019\n\nIf that.\n\nManchin and Sinema negate Collins and Murkowski \u2014 Greg \u201cStill Deplorable\u201d Little (@hokeisit) October 17, 2019\n\nWay over. Not 20, but way over. \u2014 Measured & Decisive Fred (@LesserFrederick) October 17, 2019\n\nOh you sweet summer child \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) October 17, 2019\n\nRomney and that\u2019s it. The other candidates \u2013 Sasse, Collins, Gardner, etc \u2013 are all up for election and sticking with Trump is their best shot at survival given GOP base dynamics right now. \u2014 Lukas Petersen (@LUKABUS89) October 17, 2019\n\nCollins is already taking heat for Kavanaugh, the politics with her cut in favor of removal \u2014 SteelyTom (@tom_steely) October 17, 2019\n\nOver. \u2014 Sarah Longwell (@SarahLongwell25) October 17, 2019\n\nOk Longwell now we just need a bookie to broker the bet. \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) October 17, 2019\n\nI\u2019ll lay it down on 4 \u2014 R.J. Lehmann (@raylehmann) October 17, 2019\n\nMy Venmo is Tim-Miller-77 when you are ready to throw in the towel on 4 \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) October 17, 2019\n\nIncorrect.\n\nThe number of votes to remove will match his disapproval average.\n\nTrump is at 54% disapproval today, if held, there would 54 votes in Senate to convict.\n\nAll Dem Caucus +Romney, Murkowski, Collins, McSally, Gardner, Tillis, & Toomey \u2014 Kirk Merritt (@Kirk4Defiance) October 17, 2019\n\nRomney, Murkowski, 2016 Sasse \u2014 DeLaJeff (@vagueterrain) October 17, 2019\n\nCollins is the .5? She'd be my .5. \u2014 Taylor Millard Werewolf by Night (@TaylorMVLR) October 17, 2019\n\n5 and many GOP senators running get wiped out in 2020 \u2014 TPS Report \ud83d\udc40 (@ShoNuf77) October 17, 2019\n\nPut it at zero and I\u2019d still bet the under \u2014 Gosspaine (@Gosspaine) October 17, 2019\n\nI will take the over. I see six possible votes: Murkowski\n\nAlexander*\n\nRomney\n\nCollins\n\nSasse\n\nGardner Three wildcards: Roberts*\n\nEnzi*\n\nBurr* *Announced retirement. \u2014 Joe (@joec522) October 17, 2019\n\nI don't understand. What's stopping Grassley, who's **86** and in the Senate until 2022, from voting to remove? \u2014 tphillipoff (@luxstrar) October 17, 2019\n\nI\u2019ll take the under. \u2014 Andrew Burton (@burtonad) October 17, 2019\n\nAlways the under with this one. \u2014 Hoff-mann Hoff-amazing (@OriginalBad) October 17, 2019\n\nI\u2019m going over. But at 3 \u2014 Supply Side Gaslighting (@82_and_0) October 17, 2019\n\nI think Romney, Murkowski, and Collins will all ultimately vote to remove. \u2014 Sir Humphrey (@bdquinn) October 17, 2019\n\nRemove for what?? Awesomeness? \u2014 learn computer stuff (@realbly1) October 17, 2019\n\nBet your house on removal \u2014 Timbo (@Timbo88187293) October 17, 2019\n\nNo way.\n\nIf you told me it was 0 I\u2019d take the under. https://t.co/eRrxXTzwXW \u2014 Jean-Michel Connard (@torriangray) October 17, 2019\n\nCollins, Romney, Lee, Cruz, and Sasse if the vote were held today. I suspect Murkowski & Toomey aren\u2019t far behind. Dark horse: GRAHAM. you heard me. https://t.co/4YebEuRCcj \u2014 Jason Marianna (@jwmarianna) October 17, 2019\n\nWhat's the over/under on Democrats who vote to aquit? \u2014 Dr. Franklinstein \ud83c\udf83 (@FranklinH3000) October 17, 2019\n\nZero. The hive mind will prevail as always \u2014 keeping in mind this is all just a hypothetical and Pelosi hasn\u2019t even considered bringing an impeachment inquiry to a floor vote.\n\nRelated:", "description": "The real question is who's the 0.5?
