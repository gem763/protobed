To beat the record for the world's biggest IPO, it needs to top Alibaba's sale of $25 billion of shares.\n\nBut bankers and company insiders have described the valuation as ambitious, due to a weak outlook for oil prices as deepening climate change activism could dampen investor interest, particularly in the Western world.\n\nA further risk to the $2 trillion target was raised by the Sept. 14 strikes that knocked out more than half the production of the world's top oil exporting nation. Saudi Arabia has been assuring investors it can quickly restore output.\n\nVarious sources said the kingdom has been busy looking for a more sympathetic investor base in the Middle East and Asia, while also seeking support from the wealthiest Saudi families.\n\n\"It is a natural fit and many in the region would look at it favourably as they want a piece of the pie,\" a Gulf source said.\n\nPreparations for the IPO have gone through various stages since the 2016 announcement.\n\nIssues of governance and disclosure, the acquisition of a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SE: ), disagreements among Saudi officials and advisers over the choice of an international listing venue, all contributed to a temporary halt last year.\n\nBankers from around 20 international and domestic financial institutions are now working on the company's plan to sell 1% in Riyadh before an international sale in 2020 or 2021.\n\nAfter securing support from sovereign funds, bankers would focus on Western institutional investors, another source said.\n\n\"There's no turning back now,\" one of the sources said, adding that Aramco was \"going ahead\" with the IPO.\n\nOne of the sources said Aramco could announce its intention to float on Oct. 20, with analysts' reports expected the same day. Analysts have been holding meetings at Aramco's headquarters in Dhahran this week.", "description": "Exclusive: Saudi Aramco lures sovereign funds to hit $2 trillion IPO valuation - sources", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8P0Z4_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
