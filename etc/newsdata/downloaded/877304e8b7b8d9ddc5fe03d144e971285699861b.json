Show Hide What was Operation Midland? Operation Midland was set up by the Metropolitan police in November 2014 to examine allegations of child sexual abuse and homicide. It was based on false claims by Carl Beech, known as \"Nick\", that he was abused by public figures of authority from 1975 to 1984, and witnessed the abuse of others. He made widely reported false allegations about being taken to parties at exclusive private members\u2019 clubs, in Dolphin Square in London and other locations \u2013 including swimming pools \u2013 attended by among others the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, the former home secretary Leon Brittan, the then chief of defence staff Lord Bramall, the ex-MI5 chief Sir Michael Hanley, as well as the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. Operation MIdland was closed in March 2016 with no charges brought. Beech was jailed for 18 years in July 2019 for making the claims. He is appealing against the conviction and the sentence.\n\nA 2016 report into the investigation said it was \u2018riddled with errors\u2019, identifying 43 individual errors made by officers, that the team misled a judge to get search warrants, and finding that five officers, including four detectives and a deputy assistant commissioner, would be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for failings.\n\n\n\nThe IOPC was accused of a whitewash after it rejected claims that officers acted unlawfully and should face criminal prosecution or disciplinary action.\n\nHenriques has been the chief critic of the police watchdog\u2019s findings and competence. He was commissioned by the Met to review Midland after it collapsed in March 2016.\n\nHis inquiry led to the sole witness, Beech, being unmasked as a fantasist who invented the claims, with devastating consequences for falsely accused suspects including Bramall, Brittan and Proctor.\n\nBoth Proctor and Henriques were highly critical of the IOPC\u2019s findings. Henriques\u2019s report said officers acted unlawfully in obtaining search warrants and misled a judge.\n\nLockwood said the blunders were bigger than individual officers and argued against what he called a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d: \u201cIf we want change, if we want to ensure that the failings of Operation Midland are never repeated again, it is not a witch-hunt of individuals that will prevent this, it is organisational change.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that criticism has been based on misunderstandings of the way the police watchdog works and hit out at \u201cquick media soundbites\u201d. He said: \u201cI understand that those who have suffered great injustices as a result of the lies told by Carl Beech are unhappy with our conclusions, but many of the comments made are inaccurate and appear to be based on misunderstandings of the role and remit of the IOPC.\u201d\n\nMet handling of Operation Midland sparks 'concern' in government Read more\n\nThe IOPC report published on Monday said that while there were shortcomings, there was no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing.\n\nOperation Midland was overseen by Steve Rodhouse for much of its time hunting for evidence to support Beech\u2019s lies between 2014-16.Both he and another officer, Kenny McDonald, who described Beech\u2019s claims as \u201ctrue\u201d, were cleared by the IOPC.\n\nLockwood said: \u201cIn relation to deputy assistant commissioner Rodhouse and Det Supt McDonald, their actions in supervising the search warrant applications were assessed, and would not have met the threshold for misconduct. We cannot act outside the law.\u201d\n\nHenriques attacked the IOPC in a Daily Mail newspaper article before its report was made public. Lockwood has accused the retired judge of reaching contradictory conclusions. He said: \u201cSir Richard himself states in his report that he believed the officers conducted this investigation in a conscientious manner and with propriety and honesty. Yet at the same time he fervently believes they acted unlawfully.
