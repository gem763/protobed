I love what we\u2019re able to do with our ball club and what we have. I\u2019m not here for the narrative and to talk much.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to be in the present of this Lakers franchise and team and figure out how we can be as great as we can be.\u201d\n\nNew recruit Davis was similarly dismissive, insisting that the Lakers were setting their sights higher than local bragging rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the Clippers are thinking,\u201d Davis said. \u201cBut I know what the Lakers are thinking \u2013 and that\u2019s to play basketball.\n\n\u201cObviously, they have a great team, but we know that for us it\u2019s going to be bigger than a rivalry. You know, winning a rivalry game doesn\u2019t win the championship. For us the goal is to win a championship this year.\u201d\n\nOthers however wonder whether the story of the rivalry will be less about the Lakers vs the Clippers and more about LeBron vs Kawhi.\n\n\u2013 Punchlines no more \u2013\n\nJason Whitlock, co-host of the Speak For Yourself daily show on Fox Sports, says the Leonard-James match up could potentially surpass some of the NBA\u2019s greatest rivalries.\n\n\u201cI thought Magic Johnson vs. Larry Bird in my lifetime was incredible,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cBut Kawhi Leonard now coming to take LeBron out? I think that could end up rivaling Magic & Larry.\u201d\n\nWhile James is attempting to restore the Lakers to their place at the top table in the NBA, in what will probably be the final act of his career, the incentives for Leonard at the Clippers are also huge.\n\nFor decades, the Clippers were regarded as an NBA punchline, eternally in the shadow of the star-studded Lakers and their A-list fan-base.\n\nWhile Lakers fans have celebrated 16 NBA Championships and 31 Conference titles, the Clippers have precisely zero titles to their name. Leonard leading the Clippers to a first NBA crown would secure immortality in his hometown.\n\nGeorge, who like Leonard was also courted by the Lakers this year, says the attraction of the Clippers rests in the franchise\u2019s underdog spirit.\n\n\u201cThis is a blue-collar organization,\u201d George told Sports Illustrated. \u201cWe got the nightlife, we got the L.A. scene \u2014everything about it \u2014 but this group is hardworking and just gritty.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I started my career off, in Indiana. That\u2019s how I made it in this league. So I feel at home.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 The first chapter in the most compelling storyline of the new NBA season will be written on Tuesday as LeBron James and the Los", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/0a14ef_lebron-james-anthony-davis-spearhead-los-angeles-lakers-season-lebron-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
