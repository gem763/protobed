As documented in Netflix's \"American Factory,\" China's Fuyao Glass bought a shuttered General Motors plant in Ohio in 2014 and turned it into a glass supplier for the American automaker.\n\n\"FDI [foreign direct investment], including from China, has been a significant source of manufacturing employment growth,\" says Brookings' Mark Muro. \"But now that is ebbing.\"\n\nIn Arkansas, 2 factories bought by Chinese companies stand vacant as the trade fight rages on.\n\nIn 2017, a Chinese firm bought a factory in Forrest City, Arkansas, that had been empty for 10 years and pledged to create 800 jobs, an investment that would have made that company the biggest employer in the county, reports the American Communities Project. Two years later, the facility is still a ghost town.\n\n\u201cThere are various factors that have gone into the delay, but the main factor is the tariffs,\u201d Forrest City Mayor Cedric Williams told the American Communities Project. \u201cWe\u2019re at a standstill until they get that resolved.\u201d\n\nAnother Chinese company's plan to build a paper mill is on hold in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. In an interview with Christian Science Monitor, Stephen Bell, who heads the city's chamber of commerce, called the trade conflict \"a dark cloud hanging over the future of the project.\"\n\nWhat to watch: In another potential blow to Chinese-owned companies in the U.S., the Trump administration is considering restricting American firms from investing in them, reports Bloomberg.", "description": "Chinese-owned factories employed over 26,000 U.S. workers in 2016.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/llKxD4MAHNHeNOgTqX9YgbgBLZ0=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/02/1570054008437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
