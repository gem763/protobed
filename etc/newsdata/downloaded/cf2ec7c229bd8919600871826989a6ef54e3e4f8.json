But exactly how much, we don\u2019t yet know. We need to.'\n\nIce shelves are sheets of frozen water which float in the seawater and are attached to frozen earth. This puts them at risk of breaking off and floating out to sea.\n\nWhen they are held fast they slow down the flow of ice from the land into the ocean, but if the shelf retreats or breaks it cannot provide this barrier.\n\nTherefore, ice flows more quickly from the land into the ocean and causes sea levels to rise.\n\nAt the same time, the ice shelf itself is at risk of melting and contributing to this.\n\nIce shelves in Antarctica (pictured, the Ross Ice Shelf) are vital for slowing down the flow of melting ice from the land into the sea. Without them, the process is faster and sea levels will rise faster\n\nThe video released by Dr Allen and her colleagues shows the footprint of the ice expanding and contracting as the years pass by, but it gradually gets smaller.\n\nThe edge of it, where the ice shelf meets the sea, progresses downwards away from the water and towards the land as the time goes by.\n\nWarm 'upside down rivers' which can measure miles wide and dozens of miles long are to blame for this retreating effect, the scientists said.\n\nWhile the ice is still on land, large troughs form in the shear margins \u2013 essentially gutters between moving ice and stationary ice or land \u2013 becoming thin spots when the ice flows onto the ocean.\n\nDr Alley explained that warm ocean water finds those thin spots along the base of the ice shelf, further eroding and weakening margins, making ice shelves more vulnerable to retreat and collapse.\n\nPreviously, researchers didn\u2019t know that warm plumes were so common beneath ice-shelf margins.\n\nDr Alley\u2019s team used satellite imagery to show that, at the ends of shear margins on many of Antarctica\u2019s fastest-changing glaciers, warm water rises to the surface, melting sea ice and forming areas of open water.\n\nShe said the processes appear to happen on ice shelves in both Antarctica and Greenland.\n\nThe research team published earlier work focusing on the damaging effects of meltwater on the surface of the ice shelves.\n\nStudy co-author Dr Ted Scambos, from Colorado University, added: 'Now we\u2019re seeing a new process, where warm water cuts into the shelf from below.\n\n'Like scoring a plate of glass, the trough renders the shelf weak, and in a few decades, it\u2019s gone, freeing the ice sheet to ride out faster into the ocean.'\n\nThe research was published in the journal Science Advances.", "description": "Researchers from Colorado collected satellite images of the Getz Ice Shelf, one of the largest ice shelves in Antarctica, over 15 years and saw the coastline receding back towards land.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19495600-0-image-a-25_1570632515519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
