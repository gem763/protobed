It's already being disrupted", "language": "en", "text": "WeWork's board is meeting this week as individuals tied to its major investor, SoftBank, push to have Adam Neumann step down as CEO, according to new reporting from the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThose reports are accurate, a person familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance. The meeting comes amid increased scrutiny of Neumann\u2019s reportedly erratic behavior, including his drug use and mercurial nature \u2014 and, of course, the delayed IPO for WeWork, which provides shared working spaces.\n\nWeWork is facing intense scrutiny for its losses and lofty promises \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t even gone public yet. In addition to skeptical investors, the co-working company has to worry about competitors stealing customers. And while the concept of shared, flexible workspaces seems to be sticking, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a moat surrounding the business model.\n\nA crowded field of co-working companies\n\nRegus (IWG.L), Knotel (which just became a unicorn), and Industrious are existing juggernauts. The Wing, which was seen as a WeWork for women, now allows male members.\n\nCredit: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nOther players like Liquidspace want to run the platform instead of doing the cost and time-intensive work of building and designing. Akin to Airbnb, it\u2019s merely serving as the platform for freelancers, contractors, and business owners to find a place to work.\n\nWhile most are operating under the notion that people want to sign up for a yearlong membership, players like Spacious give restaurants and bars a chance to make use of its space during off-hours by renting it out to those looking for a workspace. Splacer is a platform that connects users to art galleries and penthouse suites to throw a party or host a popup for a few hours.\n\nThe non-committal nature of work has also boosted business for LiquidSpace, according to new analysis from Thinknum Alternative Data. The San Francisco-based startup has been around since November 2010, just a few months after WeWork. And it\u2019s profitable. There are 24,000 spaces available on the database, compared to 18,000 earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s striking about the locations is that they\u2019re not just in city centers as you would find with, say WeWork or Knotel. Instead, you could find a desk or an office in your neighborhood or in \u2018cool\u2019 spots like Williamsburg or Red Hook where young entrepreneurs want to be,\u201d Thinknum publisher Joshua Fruhlinger previously told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe brands of WeWork More\n\n\u201cLike Airbnb \u2014 say you\u2019re a tourist in NYC and you don\u2019t want to stay in midtown with all the other tourists. No, you want to live like a local, so you rent a cool brownstone in Fort Greene. People want local, convenient, and cool places to work in. That writer doesn\u2019t want to go work in midtown, but she may grab a desk at a space in her neighborhood instead of the local cafe with bad wifi,\u201d he added.", "description": "A crowded field of co-working companies provide the same services as WeWork.", "authors": ["Melody Hahm", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nY4e6Bpe0DRrx26VpAZYWg--~B/aD0yNTM0O3c9MzgwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/2a615f00-6ab5-11e9-b875-0f176481ee34", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
