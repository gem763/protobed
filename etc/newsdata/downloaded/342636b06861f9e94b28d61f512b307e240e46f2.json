REUTERS/Gene Blevins\n\n\u201cThis little thing is like a bad dream,\u201d Crandell told local radio station KPCC.\n\nThe fire was stoked by sustained winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour, gusting to 50 mph (80 kph), weather officials said.\n\n\u2018DEVIL WINDS\u2019\n\nThe governor said the hot, dry \u201cDevil Winds\u201d fueling the Kincade had already begun to abate on Monday, giving crews a break, but National Weather Service forecasters said they could return later in the week.\n\nSonoma County has been hardest hit in the latest spate of more than a dozen California wildfires, with more than 100 square miles (260 square km) burned and 190,000 people evacuated.\n\nThe cause of the Kincade remained under investigation, although PG&E Corp (PCG.N) has acknowledged the blaze ignited near one of its damaged high-voltage transmission tower at about the time a malfunction of the line occurred.\n\nMore than 1 million homes and businesses were without electricity on Monday morning, most of those from planned, precautionary power outages.\n\nForecasts of high winds prompted PG&E to shut off power to 940,000 customers in 43 counties on Saturday night to guard against the risk of touching off wildfires.\n\nPG&E said it expects to issue a weather all-clear for safety inspections and restoration work to begin on Monday for the northern Sierras and North Coast, the company said.\n\nThe governor has been sharply critical of PG&E, saying corporate greed and mismanagement kept it from upgrading its infrastructure.\n\nSlideshow (33 Images)\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission on Monday said it would open a formal investigation of the wide-scale precautionary power outages imposed by several utilities this month as high winds posed heightened wildfire risks across the state.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January, citing billions of dollars in civil liabilities from deadly wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018.\n\nAfter a brief trading halt tripped by its rapid fall, PG&E\u2019s stock was down more than 20% on Monday.", "description": "Wind-whipped flames chased thousands of residents from wealthy Los Angeles neighborhoods and threatened the city's famed Getty Center museum on Monday, the latest outbreak in a wildfire season that has triggered mass evacuations and power outages across California.", "authors": ["Lisa Richwine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445955754&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1KK", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
