We're also working with independent non-government agencies to actually test our systems regularly.\n\n\"Does that mean we're solid? It means we're good but does it mean we're 100 per cent? No.\n\n\"You're never completely safe from cyber attacks. It could be as simple as someone clicking on a link and we're done.\"\n\nMr Sharpe said ASADA was a target because the Russians are trying to \"take the heat off\" themselves by tarnishing a world-leading anti-doping agency.\n\n\"I know a lot of athletes might criticise doping in Australia but we hold ourselves to a very high standard on a global stage,\" he said.\n\n\"The benefit for them is they embarrass Australia and take the heat off other programs and we have to protect athletes from that the best we can.\n\n\"Any comments I make about this makes us a higher target but we're prepared for that and we've got to continue to be better every day.\"", "description": "Australia's anti-doping agency boss David Sharpe says his organisation was not one of the agencies hacked by Russians this week, but admits it's not immune...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
