We can all sit and talk \u2013 probably even laugh \u2013 about it later,\u201d Archer told PA.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We still have to keep it a certain way.\n\n\u201c(The likelihood) to actually get hit there is so, so, so small. It could obviously hit the helmet, it could obviously hit your shoulder. To get hit there, you are really unlucky.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to get wickets. If they are worrying (about my pace), that\u2019s all on them. For me, we\u2019re here to win games.\n\n\u201cI am (looking forward to facing Smith again). It keeps the cricket a bit more interesting.\u201d\n\nAustralia looked certain to regain the Ashes with two Tests to spare before Stokes\u2019 incredible 135 not out dragged the hosts back from the brink.\n\nArcher believes the stunning comeback will have \u201cplanted a few seeds of doubt\u201d in the minds of the tourists.\n\nAsked if the momentum was now with England, the 24-year-old said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be optimists to think so.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve planted a few seeds of doubt in the Australians\u2019 heads so they will probably think twice about declaring, they will wonder if enough is actually enough.\u201d\n\nArcher is excited about the prospect of James Anderson returning to strengthen the home side\u2019s attack after he suffered a recurrence of a calf injury in the Edgbaston opener.\n\nSeamer Anderson, England\u2019s leading Test wicket taker, has been proving his fitness playing for Lancashire\u2019s second XI.\n\n\u201cI think we will be ahead (in terms of momentum), obviously Jimmy coming back at his home ground, hopefully he will want to do something special as well. I think the ball\u2019s in our court,\u201d continued Archer.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a world-class bowler and it only takes a little bit of Jimmy magic to end an innings.\n\n\u201cWhatever wickets he can get means less work for the rest of us bowlers, which means the quicker we can get off, get our feet up.\u201d\n\nArcher, who only became eligible for England earlier this year, bowled the tense super over during the victorious World Cup final against New Zealand in July and has already taken 13 Ashes wickets.\n\nReflecting on 2019 so far, the Sussex player said: \u201cIt\u2019s probably the best year of my life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made all of my debuts, all a few months apart. We\u2019ve won a lot of games in all three formats, so I am happy at the moment.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was going to get my maiden five-for this series, so I\u2019m over the moon to actually be doing all right for the team.\u201d\n\nSpecsavers are the official Test partner of the England cricket team.
