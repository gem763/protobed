Jones once crowed: 'David makes the best soup on the planet. On the planet' - but he is no longer making it for the 2GB broadcaster\n\nMr Allan's departure has been linked - apparently unfairly - to claims the arrival of a new member of Jones's team, Jake Thrupp (above), 22, had 'played havoc' with his routine\n\nIn an email to a British recruitment company Mr Allan admitted he had dreamed of joining an airline cabin crew all his life.\n\n'I just want to fly,' he said.\n\nThe message began: 'This may be one of the more unusual emails that land on your desk ... but being the airline tragic that I am proud to admit to, so here I go.\n\n'My name is David Allan very mature aged (60+) consummate hospitality employee living in Sydney NSW Australia.\n\n'Fit as a Trout!!

I'll put some style in the aisle David Allan, speaking to Daily Mail Australia\n\n'My great dream would be to represent British Airways!! Returning to the UK.\n\n'Serious honest question ... honesty will not offend !! Would B.A. (British Airways) ever engage a person of my age ??'\n\nMr Allan said he doubted the airlines would hire someone of his vintage when they would have 'thousands of drop-dead gorgeous young individuals on file.'\n\n'Is this The Man of Lamancha (a 1965 musical), or in my case the impossible dream?' he asked, before vowing to chase his ambition anyway.\n\n'I believe each and every individual is entitled to dream and to pursue that thought, I certainly will not stop, whatever it takes.'\n\nThe email was a signal the butler was interested in moving on from Jones's side and it was private until Daily Mail Australia stumbled upon on it online.\n\nMr Allan's message so moved a staff member at the UK hiring company that she posted it to British Airways on Twitter. It 'tugged at my heart strings,' she said.\n\nLong service: Mr Allan is seen here - in 2005 - serving up sports drinks to players during the Johnnie Walker super series\n\nThe nature of Jones's career - a breakfast radio host - required the services of his butler at demanding hours. The broadcaster is left, in a candid photo, and right, at work\n\nMr Allan initially denied sending the email this week, before coming clean: 'OK, you've got me over a barrel.'\n\n'Yes, if someone wants to throw a uniform at me I'll jump on board an A380 tomorrow. I'll put some style in the aisle,' he quipped.\n\nDavid makes the best soup on the planet. On the planet! - Alan Jones\n\nMr Allan's recent disappearance from Jones's side has filled the gossip pages recently.\n\nHe has often featured in newspaper profiles about Jones where the influential broadcaster has crowed about his exceptional cooking skills.\n\n'David makes the best soup on the planet. On the planet,' Jones told a reporter in 2011.\n\nBut Daily Mail Australia understands it was time to relax and do other things after a long period of service to a radio host who required assistance at all hours of the day.\n\n'In my mind ... it's the most coveted job in the land': Mr Allan admits he's unlikely to start on a new career path - but a man can dream\n\nThe retiree now has a more peaceful lifestyle involving weekend cricket and gardening.\n\nHe and his wife also take their beloved cat for a walk - yes, cat - about Sydney's leafy north.\n\nIn an interview, Mr Allan said he had harboured his other ambition of flying his whole life - even while serving dinner for airline executives.\n\n'All my life I wanted to represent British Airways - from the age of 15,' he said. He loved their 'We'll Take Care of You' slogan and was enamored with TV shows about Captain Bristow.\n\nBut despite vowing to pursue his dream last year - even suggesting he could have a good ten years of service - Mr Allan admits he's unlikely to start on a new career path.\n\n'Getting a job with an airline is not like any other form of employment in the world in my mind and in my mind ... it is the most coveted job in the land.\n\nHe joked: 'I think somebody has to be realistic at 72 with a battered bald head like mine. There's no way in the world anyone would look at you.'", "description": "Alan Jones's trusted long-time butler left the talkback radio king's service after confessing he wanted to pursue his 'great dream' of becoming a flight attendant.", "authors": ["Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/05/20165452-0-image-a-2_1571978137566.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
