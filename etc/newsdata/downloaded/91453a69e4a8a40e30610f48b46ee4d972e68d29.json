But legally, they're in the clear even when hosting the most odious content.\n\nBe smart, per Axios' David McCabe: Lawmakers have been threatening broad changes to the immunity law for over a year but haven't advanced any legislative proposals doing so. At this point, it's more potent leverage than it is something they've been willing to get moving.\n\nDetails: Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects companies that carry user-generated content \u2014 like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other sites \u2014 from bearing legal liability for what their users post.\n\nIt's become a cornerstone of the modern internet since it was passed in 1996, freeing companies from having to closely police every sentence, video or photo published on their platforms.\n\nBut critics say it's allowed them to shirk a societal responsibility to keep harmful and false information from spreading online.\n\nAfter a hearing today on national security implications of deepfakes \u2014 AI-manipulated videos \u2014 Schiff told reporters:\n\n\"If the social media companies can't exercise a proper standard of care when it comes to a whole variety of fraudulent or illicit content, then we have to think about whether that immunity still makes sense. These are not nascent industries or companies that are struggling for viability \u2014 they're now behemoths, and we need them to act responsibly.\"\n\nOne idea for how to update the law comes from Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor who has written extensively about deepfakes and was a witness at today's hearing.\n\n\"It shouldn't be a free pass,\" Citron said of the immunity. \"It should be conditioned on reasonable content moderation practices.\"\n\nThat would mean that companies like Facebook could get in legal trouble if someone posted a defamatory fake video and the company didn't act reasonably to take it down or tell users it was manipulated.\n\nThe \"reasonable person\" standard is commonly applied across law.\n\nWhat's next: If this idea picks up steam again in Congress, expect Big Tech \u2014 including any site that hosts user comments and reviews, user-written ads, or videos and photos \u2014 to fight tooth and nail to keep its Section 230 immunity.", "description": "A motley group of policymakers calling to reconsider legal protections for tech companies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/p9T_oWIGXZdQJVQDEuimE1EveXU=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/06/13/1560463631664.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-13"}
