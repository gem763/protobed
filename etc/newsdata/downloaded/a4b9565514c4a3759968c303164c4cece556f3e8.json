At the moment it's an easy way to target players and say negative things, that is a problem in itself.\n\n\"The social media side needs to be taken care of.\"\n\nMorgan said he was approached by the Premier League to be a part of their new BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) advisory committee formed with the aim of dealing with racism in the sport.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity and I've got something to offer,\" the 35-year-old added.\n\n\"We're going to try and make changes for future generations to improve the game for them so it's easier for them to come through without having to go through racism in any capacity.\" (Reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford )", "description": "Oct 18 (Reuters) - Leicester City skipper Wes Morgan has said racist abuse in football has got worse since he started his career and the rise of social media...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
