REUTERS/Simon Dawson/Files\n\nThe FTSE 250 .FTMC, which had rallied more than 3% since last week on hopes that Britain could clinch a timely divorce deal, fell 0.9%. Traders are eyeing a crunch summit this week after last-ditch talks between London and the European Union.\n\nThe blue-chip FTSE 100 .FTSE was roughly flat as gains in exporter firms like Reckitt (RB.L), due to a weaker pound, were offset by a drop in housebuilders after Barratt pointed to signs of weakening future revenue.\n\nBarratt (BDEV.L), Britain\u2019s largest housebuilder, gave up 3.7%, while peers Persimmon (PSN.L) and Taylor Wimpey (TW.L) lost around 3% each.\n\nThe sector .FTNMX3720, which is sensitive to updates that can impact consumer spending, has also seen volatile trading in recent weeks amid a flurry of Brexit headlines.\n\nOfficials involved in eleventh hour negotiations overnight said that differences over the terms of the split had narrowed significantly.\n\nThat followed a Bloomberg report that a draft deal was close to being sealed, which spurred a rally in firms more domestically exposed, including banks such as Lloyds (LLOY.L) and RBS (RBS.L), and led mid-caps to a more than one-year high.\n\n\u201cThe permutations are labyrinthine, but financial markets are not hanging around to await the details,\u201d Oanda analyst Jeffrey Halley said, though he warned that market participants could yet be left disappointed.\n\nUncertainty remains whether a deal will be sealed at an EU summit on Thursday and Friday, and if Britain\u2019s minority government can get it through parliament.\n\nNews-driven moves saw AIM-listed ASOS (ASOS.L), a victim of multiple profit warnings this year, jump 14% after the online fashion retailer said it had made strides in resolving warehousing issues that ate into its annual profit.\n\nIn contrast, clothing retailer Next (NXT.L) skid 2.5% after its CEO sold more than 10 million pounds worth of shares, while mid-cap Royal Mail (RMG.L) fell 6% after a major union voted in favour of a nationwide strike.\n\nShares of Woodford Patient Capital Trust (WPCT.L) sank 6.4% to a fresh record low, a day after embattled money manager Neil Woodford resigned as its investment manager.", "description": "London's domestically focussed mid-cap index slipped on Wednesday with investors looking for confirmation that a Brexit deal was really in the offing.", "authors": ["Shashwat Awasthi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441399437&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0K1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
