The BBC understands the government was asked to fund a bailout of \u00a3250m, which was denied.\n\nSome 16,000 holidaymakers were booked to come back on Monday, and authorities hope to get at least 14,000 of them home on chartered flights.\n\nThe CAA - an arms-length body set up by the Department for Transport (DfT) - has chartered 45 jets to bring customers home from locations including Central America and Turkey. It will fly 64 routes on Monday in an undertaking called Operation Matterhorn.\n\nOperators including easyJet and Virgin have supplied some aircraft, with jets coming from as far afield as Malaysia.\n\nAll Thomas Cook holidays are now cancelled and customers will need to seek compensation via the government's Atol scheme, or from their credit card or insurance companies.\n\nSome passengers trying to get home have reported queues and disruption at airports, while others complain they have been left in the dark about what happens next.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Passengers are facing queues and disruption, from destinations such as Majorca\n\nCustomers seeking information can visit the CAA's special Thomas Cook website. Those scheduled to return to the UK within the next 48 hours or who are having problems with their accommodation or need special assistance can ring 0300 303 2800 in the UK or +44 1753 330 330 from abroad.\n\nWhat is the government doing?\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps defended the move not to grant Thomas Cook a bailout.\n\n\"I fear it would have kept them afloat for a very short period of time and then we would have been back in the position of needing to repatriate people in any case,\" he said on the BBC's Today programme.\n\nThe company's large debts and High Street-focused business made it a poor candidate for survival, he said.\n\nOverall, Operation Matterhorn will cost the taxpayer around \u00a3100m, he added.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC the government should have bailed out Thomas Cook, \"if only to stabilise the situation while a real plan for the future of the company could be addressed\".\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to help stranded holidaymakers, but also questioned whether company directors were properly motivated to \"sort such matters out\".\n\nImage copyright Ruth Morse Image caption Ruth Morse and her fianc\u00e9 Jordan Miller\n\n'I feel completely devastated'\n\nRuth Morse, from Halesowen, West Midlands, was due to marry her partner in Cyprus on 8 October, but now doubts the wedding will go ahead.\n\nShe booked the whole event through Thomas Cook, including the decorations, the cake, wedding venues and a private bar.\n\nAnd of the 44 guests due to attend, about 25 booked their flights and accommodation through the travel agent.\n\n\"At the moment, Thomas Cook have not been in contact, so we are in the dark,\" Ruth says.\n\n\"I know we are protected by Atol, but I'm unsure about the things we bought from third parties through Thomas Cook, like the decorations. They cost me \u00a34,000.\"\n\nRuth says she had planned her \"dream wedding\" for two years. What makes it doubly hard is that much of the money she spent came from family members, including her mother and her late brother Ben, who was murdered in 2017.\n\n\"From the grief we had, we pulled ourselves together to arrange our dream day,\" she says.\n\n\"We will rebook the wedding, but I won't do it abroad again because I have lost faith. I feel completely devastated by all of this.\"\n\nHow will holidaymakers get home?\n\nWhile an estimated 150,000 Britons are affected by Thomas Cook's collapse, the company has a further 350,000 to 450,000 customers abroad, some of whom have been affected.\n\nIn Germany, one of Thomas Cook's main markets, insurance companies will help organise the response to its collapse.\n\nUK customers will be brought home \"as close as possible\" to their booked return date, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said.\n\nImage caption Thomas Cook planes have been impounded at Manchester Airport\n\nCustomers will be on special free flights or booked on to another scheduled airline at no extra cost, with details of each flight to be posted on a dedicated website as soon as they are available.\n\nThe DfT added that a \"small number\" of passengers might need to book their own flight home and reclaim the costs.\n\nCustomers have been urged not to cut short their holiday or go to the airport without checking the website for more information about their return journey.\n\nThe CAA is also contacting hotels accommodating Thomas Cook customers, who have booked as part of a package, to tell them that the cost of their accommodation will be covered by the government's Air Travel Trust Fund and Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol).\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Travel expert Simon Calder on the collapse of \"the mightiest brand in travel\"\n\nTim Johnson, policy director of the CAA, told BBC News that customers whose future holidays had been cancelled would be informed of how they can claim a refund on the website.\n\nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom has said she will write to the Insolvency Service urging them to \"fast-track\" their investigation into the circumstances surrounding Thomas Cook's going into liquidation.\n\nThe investigation will also consider the conduct of top directors, who have been paid a combined \u00a320m in salaries and bonuses since 2014.\n\nA Cabinet spokesman said: \"People will rightly look at the size of bonuses to some of the directors and have serious concerns about that.\n\n\"There's a broader issue at play about collapsing firms and director pay and we are looking that more broadly as a government.\"\n\nGETTY Thomas Cook in numbers 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide\n\n9,000 jobs at risk in the UK\n\n150,000 British holidaymakers to be repatriated\n\n600,000 total customers abroad\n\n34 planesowned (Airbus A321 and A330) Source: Thomas Cook\n\nWhat happens to staff?\n\nEmployees at some Thomas Cook shops have already been met with representatives of the firm's administrators, who told them they would be made redundant.\n\nJobs at the tour operator's airline and in its engineering division may also go.\n\nSome workers are being kept on, however, but there is no definite number.\n\nThomas Cook shops across the UK are not due to open on Monday.\n\nWhat about Thomas Cook's international operations?\n\nFor now, Thomas Cook's Indian, Chinese, German and Nordic subsidiaries will continue to trade as normal.\n\nThis is because, from a legal standpoint, they are considered separate to the UK parent company and are not under the jurisdiction of the UK's Official Receiver.\n\nThey do, however, share services - such as aircraft and IT - with their parent company and will need to strike rescue deals in the coming weeks to keep trading.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nThomas Cook had secured a \u00a3900m rescue deal led by its largest shareholder Chinese firm Fosun in August, but a recent demand from its banks to raise a further \u00a3200m in contingency funding had put the deal in doubt.\n\nFosun said in a statement: \"We extend our deepest sympathy to all those affected by this outcome.\"\n\nThe holiday company spent all of Sunday in talks with lenders trying to secure the additional funding and salvage the deal, but to no avail.\n\nThomas Cook has blamed a series of issues for its problems, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News from Manchester airport, travel expert Simon Calder said Thomas Cook \"wasn't ready for the 21st Century\".\n\n\"Now everybody can pretend they are a travel agent. They've got access to all the airline seats, hotel beds, car rentals in the world and they can put things together themselves.\n\nMr Calder, travel editor at The Independent, added that planes at the airport began to be impounded shortly after 00:00 BST.\n\nWhile the company was closing shops to try and cut costs, closing 21 in March, it still had more than 500 outlets, bringing large costs compared to online competitors.\n\nIn another sign of its slow progress in mending its finances, it only stopped dividend payments to investors in November.\n\nWhat are your rights?\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nIf you are on a package holiday, you are covered by the Atol scheme.\n\nThe scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment.\n\nAtol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating.\n\nIf you have a holiday booked in the future, you will also be refunded by the scheme.\n\nIf you have booked a flight-only deal, you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund.\n\nWhen Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.\n\nHere is more information on Atol protection and your rights.\n\nAre you a Thomas Cook customer or member of staff?
