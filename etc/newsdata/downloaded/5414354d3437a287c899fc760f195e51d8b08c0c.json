While this might sound like a large distance, NASA still classifies the passing as a \u2018close approach.\u2019\n\n2019 SX5\u2019s passing comes just days after a swarm of asteroids made a close approach with our planet.\n\nOn October 8, seven asteroids passed Earth, including one dubbed 2019 TW1, which measures up to 16 metres in diameter - making it almost twice as big as a London bus!\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nWhile this all sounds rather scary, NASA reassures that there currently aren\u2019t any asteroids on a collision course with Earth.\n\nNASA explained: \u201cNASA knows of no asteroid or comet currently on a collision course with Earth, so the probability of a major collision is quite small.\n\n\u201cIn fact, as best as we can tell, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years.\u201d", "description": "The asteroid, dubbed 2019 SX5, is estimated by NASA to measure between 62 and 140 metres in diameter", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19007426.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_asteroid-approaching-planet-Earth-meteorite-in-orbit-before-impact.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
