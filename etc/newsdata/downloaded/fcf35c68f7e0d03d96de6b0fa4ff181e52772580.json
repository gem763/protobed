Carter Hart stopped 28 shots.\n\nIt was the first regular-season game outside of North America in Philadelphia\u2019s 52-year history.\n\n\u201cI think tonight\u2019s game, everybody was down there, everybody was consistent in what we were doing and it was a team win,\u201d Philadelphia captain Claude Giroux said. \u201cIt was a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nPatrick Kane had a goal and two assists for Chicago, which opened the 2009-10 season in Finland. Alex Nylander and Alex DeBrincat also scored.\n\n\u201cI like the way we fought back,\u201d said Kane, who had a career-high 110 points last season. \u201cWhatever the numbers were tonight, I still think I have more to give to the team.\u201d\n\nThe Blackhawks are hoping to return to the playoffs after a two-year absence, but defensemen Dennis Gilbert and Slater Koekkoek each made a costly mistake after the blue liners struggled last year.\n\nKonecny turned Gilbert\u2019s turnover into a 1-0 lead for Philadelphia 6:24 into the first, beating Corey Crawford on the glove side.\n\nLindblom was credited with a power-play goal 6:28 into the second when his shot bounced off the crossbar and was deflected by Koekkoek into his own net. Konecny then converted a backhander with 1:56 left in the period, giving the Flyers a 3-1 lead.\n\nChicago played without defensemen Calvin de Haan and Connor Murphy due to injuries.\n\n\u201cWe turned way too many pucks over, that\u2019s where we exposed ourselves defensively,\u201d coach Jeremy Colliton said.\n\nVigneault became the 21st coach in Flyers history in April after they missed the playoffs for the fourth time in seven seasons. He also has coached Montreal, Vancouver and the New York Rangers.\n\nHe was behind the bench as Philadelphia held off Chicago in the 26th NHL regular-season game played in Europe, and the fifth in Prague.\n\nThe Blackhawks pulled within one when DeBrincat one-timed a pass from Kane past Hart with 13 seconds left in the second. It was DeBrincat\u2019s first goal since he signed a three-year contract extension worth $19.2 million.\n\nRaffl responded for Philadelphia in the third, skating around the net and sliding a backhand between Crawford\u2019s pads for a 4-2 lead at 9:48.\n\nKane scored with 2:07 remaining, but the Flyers held on.\n\nCrawford finished with 34 saves. Nylander scored in the first period in his first game since he was acquired in an offseason trade with Buffalo.\n\nThe NHL returned to Europe for the third straight year as part of its efforts to grow the fan base in hockey-mad countries like the Czech Republic, Sweden, Finland and others.\n\nIt will be back in Europe next month when the Tampa Bay Lightning face the Sabres in the Swedish capital of Stockholm.\n\nNOTES: NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the league is planning to play more regular-season games in Europe next year, but the details are still being finalized.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlackhawks: Host the San Jose Sharks in their home opener Thursday night.\n\nFlyers: Host the New Jersey Devils on Wednesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It was a successful home debut for Flyers coach Alain Vigneault - a long, long way from Philadelphia.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Karel Janicek"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/czech_republic_flyers_blackhawks_hockey_67736_c0-130-3099-1936_s1770x1032.jpg?eb054e6bd7992a34d7f2943b4070f5dbfb5a035c", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
