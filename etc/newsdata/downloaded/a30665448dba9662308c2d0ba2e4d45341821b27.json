With just three weeks left until the U.K. is due to leave the EU, negotiations have stalled in Brussels and the time for striking an orderly separation agreement is almost up.\n\nJohnson says he is determined to force Britain out of the EU on the existing deadline of Oct. 31 -- even if that means leaving with no agreement to cushion the impact on the economy. EU leaders, meanwhile, are preparing to give Britain an extension to the deadline, even though that\u2019s something Johnson says he will never accept.\n\nThe atmosphere surrounding the negotiations had turned sour in recent days as the two sides blamed each other for their failure to make progress.\n\nThe joint statement from Johnson and Varadkar marked a positive shift in tone. But it also highlighted the difficulties the negotiators have faced, notably on agreeing arrangements for customs checks on goods crossing the Irish border and how the region\u2019s community could give its consent to these plans.\n\n\u201cThey agreed to reflect further on their discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them,\u201d the joint statement said. Following the discussions, Varadkar will consult with the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiating taskforce. U.K. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Friday morning.\n\nThe key disagreement between the U.K. and the EU is over how to ensure there are no customs checkpoints at Ireland\u2019s land border with the U.K.\n\nJohnson has proposed limited customs inspections away from the frontier, but Varadkar insists any such checks will threaten peace in the region, which suffered decades of terrorism.\n\nThe EU has also criticized the U.K.\u2019s plan to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a veto over the deal. Johnson\u2019s team say it\u2019s vital to allow the region\u2019s community to give \u201cconsent\u201d for the future arrangements on the border. But for the EU, allowing a veto for Northern Irish politicians would undermine the point of a long-term guarantee against a hard border going up at the frontier.\n\nIreland\u2019s position will guide the EU\u2019s remaining 27 member states. If Johnson can convince Varadkar to move, there is a chance a deal could be outlined ahead of the crucial summit of EU leaders Oct. 17-18.\n\n(Adds detail, context.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Tim Ross in London at tross54@bloomberg.net;Robert Hutton in London at rhutton1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson at fjackson@bloomberg.net, Thomas Penny, Kitty Donaldson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.The U.K. and the European Union inched closer to an agreement on the terms of Brexit after a positive meeting between the British and Irish leaders identified a \u201cpathway\u201d to a potential deal.U.K. Prime Minister", "authors": ["Tim Ross", "Robert Hutton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
