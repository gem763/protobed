He was punted from the property in April and subsequently found guilty of violating the terms of his bail conditions by entering nearly seven years earlier. He has been jailed ever since at Belmarsh Prison in London, serving a nearly yearlong sentence.\n\nFederal prosecutors in the U.S. unsealed criminal charges against Assange shortly after his latest arrest, and a hearing to decide whether he should be extradited to stand trial is currently scheduled to take place in London early next year.\n\nRepresentatives for Assange and WikiLeaks did not immediately answer messages requesting comment.\n\nAssange, 48, is charged in the U.S. in connection with the solicitation and publication by WikiLeaks of classified U.S. documents. His legal team has previously described the prosecution as \u201can outrageous and full-frontal assault on journalistic rights.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
