Until Casa banned the planes from flying on 13 March it was used by on flights in and out of Australia by two overseas airlines, Fiji Airways and Singapore\u2019s SilkAir.\n\nThe Max, which was Boeing\u2019s fastest-selling model, was attractive to airlines because it has larger engines than the standard 737, giving it a longer range and greater capacity.\n\nBut the planes were grounded in March after Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in Kenya, killing all 157 people on board.\n\nIt was the second lethal Max crash in six months. In October 2018, a Lion Air flight from Jakarta to Bangka Island plummeted into the Java Sea, killing all 189 passengers and crew.\n\nThe day after the Ethiopian Airlines crash the FAA defended the airworthiness of the Max, but within two days it was forced to ground the fleet by Donald Trump.\n\nInvestigations have focused on an automated system that under some circumstances can compensate for the extra lift generated by the bigger engines by pushing the nose of the plane down.\n\nThe crashes have also raised concerns that engineering quality at Boeing may have suffered as the company pursued profits in competition with its European rival, Airbus.\n\nIn early April, the FAA set up a joint technical review team with other aviation authorities, including Europe\u2019s Easa and Australia\u2019s Casa.\n\nA fortnight ago, the FAA said the team was \u201ctaking additional time to finish documenting its work\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe expect the group to submit its observations, findings, and recommendations in the coming weeks,\u201d it said.", "description": "Civil Aviation Safety Authority says it will make its own call on the 737 Max, which was grounded after two crashes left 346 dead", "authors": ["Ben Butler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/188e33baec05c350e7cb15c4dc61ee2776c3c878/0_95_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4d9d7fcfd52edaae28f9b7c3acfce214", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
