The EU\u2019s decision is unlikely to come before Friday.\n\nSome cabinet ministers, including the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, are cautious about asking for an election.\n\nThey believe the majority of 30 achieved by the government on the second reading of the Brexit bill on Tuesday suggests Johnson\u2019s deal has enough support to carry it through all its stages in parliament.\n\nJeremy Corbyn urged by MPs to resist calls for election Read more\n\nSmith, who was Theresa May\u2019s chief whip, has examined the various amendments to the withdrawal agreement bill, and does not believe any of them would necessitate pulling it. \u201cJulian\u2019s view is that the numbers are there,\u201d said an ally.\n\nSome Tory MPs said there also were serious misgivings on the back benches about the idea of an immediate election. \u201cThere\u2019s a big, big fight going on, basically,\u201d one said. \u201cThe parliamentary party is split 50/50. Personally, I don\u2019t think an election is a very good idea.\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cI\u2019d rather we focused more on passing the bill. It would be better to go to voters having finished the job. I feel that\u2019s what most colleagues want.\u201d\n\nHowever, hard Brexit supporters appear to be more gung-ho, with leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg fearing support for the bill could yet fall away \u2013 if the 19 Labour rebels who backed it fail to secure the amendments they would like to see, for example.\n\nMembers of the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) are also nervous about the legislation being amended in a way that they would find unacceptable \u2013 such as obliging the government to seek a customs union.\n\nAfter Johnson\u2019s meeting with Corbyn on Wednesday, Downing Street briefed that Corbyn had \u201cmade clear Labour have no policy except more delays\u201d and hinted heavily that Johnson\u2019s next move would be to ask MPs to support a December election.\n\n\u201cAny time that parliament gets a vote for delay, it will always choose delay,\u201d said a Downing Street source. \u201cTherefore, if this parliament is unwilling to vote for a deal, we will have to go for a general election.\u201d\n\nDespite the bullish rhetoric, Johnson\u2019s chief whip, Mark Spencer, later met his Labour counterpart, Nick Brown, to explore whether a new timetable could be agreed for scrutinising the bill. That suggested the idea of trying to pilot the bill through parliament had not been ditched altogether \u2013 particularly if only a short extension is granted.\n\nIn the meeting between the two party leaders, held in the same Westminster office where Corbyn had previously confronted May, Dominic Cummings suggested MPs should be prepared to sit all night to hit next week\u2019s Halloween deadline, according to one witness.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson has been trying to persuade EU leaders not to grant an extension \u2013 or at least to keep it short.\n\nThe PM spoke to Donald Tusk on Wednesday morning, telling the European council\u2019s president, who has called for EU leaders to allow a further Brexit extension, that he does not personally want a delay. He also discussed the issue with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.\n\nJohnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe PM was clear in restating his position that he does not believe that any delay beyond 31 October is in the interests of the UK or the EU and that we need to get the deal through parliament before that point.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister was forced to write to the EU on Saturday to seek a delay until 31 January under a backbench-instigated law averting no deal, but had hoped to rush the bill putting his plan into law through parliament this week, to meet the current 31 October deadline.\n\nCorbyn used all his questions at PMQs to ask Johnson about elements of the bill, including standards for environmental, consumer and workers\u2019 rights, and the continued inclusion of Northern Ireland in elements of the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\nAfter Johnson incorrectly said there would be \u201cno checks between Northern Ireland and GB [Great Britain]\u201d, Corbyn accused him of having not properly read his own bill.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister unlawfully prorogued parliament; he said he would refuse to comply with [the] law; he threw Northern Ireland under a bus; he ripped up protections for workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections; lost every vote along the way; and tried to prevent genuine, democratic scrutiny and debate,\u201d the Labour leader said.\n\n\u201cEven worse than that, he\u2019s not that familiar with it.\u201d", "description": "Prime minister awaits decision of EU27 over extension before next move", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e9ea84ae5a8d7b5f42de6508323c14f69073095/0_155_3474_2085/master/3474.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e93723d341a0f31ff1b827d7b88d6997", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
