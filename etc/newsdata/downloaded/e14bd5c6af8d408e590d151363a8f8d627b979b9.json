As an afternoon breeze picks up from the northeast around 10-15 mph, temperatures get capped in the mid-to-upper 50s. Confidence: Medium\n\nTonight: After the chance of a lingering early-evening shower, winds slowly wane with partially clearing skies. We cool by sunrise into the mid-40s to low 50s.

Temperatures could rise pretty quickly from morning 50s to afternoon warmth in the upper 60s to low 70s. A tad above average for the date. Enjoy! Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Clouds build. A couple of raindrops could start falling after midnight, with an increasing chance of rain toward morning. Temperatures fall back to lows from the mid-50s outside the Beltway to near 60 downtown. Confidence: Medium\n\n\n\nSoggy autumn leaves, taken Oct. 16.

A potential for a period of steadier and heavier rain as well, especially toward sunset, but the details are subject to change. Mid-60s to around 70 degrees looks likely for afternoon highs. Any remaining rain should end fairly quickly Tuesday evening as winds come from the northwest, cooling us back to chilly (but seasonable) lows in the 40s. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nWednesday: Sunshine with low to mid-60s for high temperatures is near enough to average that we can call it splendidly fall-like. We could have some moderate winds from the west, but it shouldn\u2019t be too annoying, as it appears now.
