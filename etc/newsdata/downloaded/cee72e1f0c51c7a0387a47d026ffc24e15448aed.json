Over the course a 17-year period, data found that female CFOs generated a combined $1.8 trillion more in profit excess than the averages of the sector averages.\n\n\u201cWhat we found was that there are common attributes amongst both men and women that are associated with outperformance. Female executives simply seem to have these attributes more frequently,\u201d Daniel Sandberg, the study\u2019s author and S&P\u2019s senior director of quantamental research, told Yahoo Finance in an interview.\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE - In this July 16, 2019, file photo Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra speaks during the opening of contract talks with the United Auto Workers in Detroit.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) More\n\nNotable progress has been made over recent years, with companies promoting women to the top ranks \u2014 like Mary T. Barra at General Motors (GM), Amy Hood being appointed CFO of Microsoft (MSFT) and Jennifer Piepszak to CFO at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the largest U.S. bank.\n\nDespite these gains, female executives remain underrepresented, with the male-to-female ratio of 19:1 for CEOs and 6.5:1 for CFOs, at the end of 2018, data showed.\n\nSandberg had a theory for why women-led companies remain so rare, given that male and female leaders surveyed by S&P\u2019s study were found to have had similarities in their biographies.\n\n\u201cI think that higher level of selectivity basically translates to a higher bar for women to get into these positions,\u201d said Sandberg.\n\nS&P Global Market Intelligence - \"When Women Lead, Firms Win\" More\n\nS&P\u2019s data suggested companies have real incentive to boost female representation in the executive suite. The study found that in the 24 months after taking on the role, female CEOs saw a 20% increase in stock price compared to their male counterpoints. Similarly, data found that profitability climbed 6% at companies with female CFOs, and 8% larger stock returns.\n\nThe firm used artificial intelligence and language processing to analyze newly appointed executives' biographies, in order to find attributes associated with success. \u201cTechnology and leadership seems to stand out as individual attributes that that really were associated with higher success,\u201d said Sandberg.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Smith is a Segment Producer/Booker at Yahoo Finance.
