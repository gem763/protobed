The levies would be so huge that they would cause the larger insurers to fail as well.\n\nThe impact of such a scenario would spread beyond the insurance sector to industries that rely on insurance to operate, such as transportation and manufacturing, Kleffner said in an interview.\n\nIn an isolated real-world example of this phenomenon, the collapse of a single major insurer in Australia in 2001 caused medical services to be temporarily curtailed due to uncertainty over coverage.\n\nAt a minimum, a major catastrophic earthquake in Canada would lead to months of dislocation and disruption as businesses scrambled to find insurance from other sources, Kleffner said.\n\nPrevious research pointing to significant risks to Canada\u2019s insurance industry from a major catastrophe includes a report from the Conference Board of Canada in 2016, which estimated the country\u2019s rate of economic growth would be halved in the short term. That report further warned of the potential for nearly $100 billion in cumulative losses in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the long term.\n\nA 2016 report from the C.D. Howe Institute, authored by Nick Le Pan, former head of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), recommended the adoption of a federal emergency backstop arrangement to minimize systemic financial impact on the economy at large. That report noted that policymakers\u2019 focus on the buildup of risk in the banking system since the 2008 financial crisis had not been mirrored in the insurance industry when it came to the impact of natural disasters.\n\nThe issue of catastrophic earthquake risk made it on to a 2017 list of issues the Department of Finance planned to address, but the impact on the insurance industry was subsequently put on a longer-term track to be addressed by around 2024, according to Kleffner.\n\nAlso in 2017, the industry-funded Property and Casualty Insurance Compensation Corporation and the Insurance Bureau of Canada made a joint submission to the federal finance department proposing to expand the compensation body\u2019s toolkit by allowing it to borrow money from the government in the event of a catastrophic earthquake. That idea remains at the proposal stage, Kleffner said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Finance confirmed the government\u2019s pledge in a 2017 consultation paper to consider ways to limit system-wide risks that an extreme earthquake could pose to property and casualty insurers.\n\n\u201cThis work is underway,\u201d Anna Arneson, manager of media relations and consultation, said in an email.\n\nShe added that OSFI, the federal banking and insurance regulator, imposes stringent standards on federally regulated insurers that require them to have sufficient \u201cresources to withstand a 1-in-500-year earthquake.\u201d\n\nKleffner said it would be much more efficient to have a government backstop arrangement set up ahead of time than to try to bail out the insurance industry if necessary once a catastrophe struck. But she acknowledged the difficulty of trying to spur action with no way to predict how soon the arrangement would be needed.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t perceived to be an urgent risk because there hasn\u2019t been a recent major earthquake to remind people, and most elected governments don\u2019t have a long planning horizon,\u201d she said.\n\nIf the government were to act to mitigate the risks to the insurance industry and economy, Kleffner said she thinks Canada would do well to adopt a model put in place in Japan. In that public-private model, the government provides reinsurance to backstop private insurance liabilities stemming from massive earthquakes, and the amount to be paid by government is determined by pre-set triggers and limits.", "description": "Canada the only G7 nation without federal involvement plan to help the insurance industry in the event of massive losses", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/agettyimages-508411088.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
