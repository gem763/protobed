However, he has also been deeply embroiled in controversy over his expenses, temper, and more recently handling of Brexit. Mr Bercow was heavily criticised for his costly globetrotting, lavish entertainment bill, and getting the taxpayer to fund an overhaul of his opulent grace-and-favour apartment. He also notoriously charged the public purse for his Sky Sports package, and unlike the PM, made no contribution to running costs. His use of chauffeur-driven cars also landed him in hot water. One trip to an event just 0.7 miles from Parliament cost \u00a3158. In 2012 he refused to follow in the footsteps of Gordon Brown and David Cameron by giving up the ultra-generous, non-contributory pension traditionally granted to PMs and the Speaker. He did volunteer that he will not take the \u00a31million perk until he turns 65 - although aides did not immediately confirm tonight that he will stick to the promise. He also faced allegations of flying off the handle at staff, and mishandling the bullying scandal that wracked the Commons during his tenure. But while those episodes were seen as damaging, his handling of Brexit completely poisoned relations with the Tories. He was accused of repeatedly bending procedures to ensure that Remainers could derail the government's policy, taking control of Commons business to pass legislation effectively ruling out No Deal.\n\nCandidates for the powerful post include current deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, Labour's Harriet Harman and Chris Bryant, and Eleanor Laing and Shailesh Vara for the Tories.\n\nThe Speaker is meant to be an impartial referee of debates, but Mr Bercow has repeatedly been 'creative' with the rules to frustrate the government - saying his duty was to champion MPs against the executive.\n\nTheresa May's Brexit plans were thwarted partly as a result of his intervention, and last month a rebel law was passed ordering the PM to beg the EU for a Brexit extension if he has not secured a deal by October 19.\n\nMr Bercow was also at the centre of protests against the PM's decision to prorogue Parliament in the run-up to Brexit, saying it was 'not normal'.\n\nWhen Andrea Leadsom was Commons Leader he was accused of calling her a 'stupid woman' in the chamber. Mr Bercow insisted he had only said she was 'stupid' and refused to apologise\n\nBut the episode highlighted that the Speaker is the final arbiter of conduct in the Commons \u2013 including his own.\n\nAt Tory conference last week, the current Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said he admired many of the things the Speaker had done in his 10-year tenure.\n\nBut he said Mr Bercow's 'recent mistakes' had brought the public standing of the House to 'the lowest point in modern history'.\n\nAllies of the PM have made clear he will not follow the convention that Commons Speakers are automatically elevated to the upper chamber when they resign.\n\nOne Cabinet minister told MailOnline that the powers of the Speaker must now be addressed.\n\n'I think we need a shake-up of the rules and the Speaker's powers and I think it's something we need to look at after the election if we get a majority,' they said\n\n'When you have a rogue speaker, he is all-powerful.\n\n'Parliament has a rulebook and it has conventions about its procedures that have developed over a long period for a very good reason.\n\n'You can't have someone in that position getting up in the morning and deciding that he is going to do things differently and bend the rules as he wishes.'", "description": "The Speaker can never again be allowed to 'bend the rules as they wish' like John Bercow, a Cabinet minister has told MailOnline.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/22/19315414-0-image-a-7_1570223601909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
