This is not a ceasefire - ceasefires can only happen between two legitimate sides,\" he told a news conference.\n\n\"When the terrorist elements completely leave the safe zone, we can stop the operation,\" Cavusoglu said.\n\nAnkara considers the YPG a terrorist organisation with links to Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants in Turkey. YPG was a main U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State.\n\nCavusoglu said the two sides had agreed for heavy arms to be taken from the YPG and for their positions to be destroyed - fulfilling a long-held request by Ankara.\n\nContradicting separate remarks in Ankara by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Cavusoglu also said Turkey had given no guarantees regarding the Syrian border town of Kobani.\n\nHe said Turkey would discuss the town of Manbij and other regions with Russia, which, along with the Syrian government forces, have deployed in several positions vacated by the United States.\n\nCavusoglu was quoted earlier on Thursday as saying Moscow had promised Ankara that the YPG militia will not be in the Syrian territories across the border.
