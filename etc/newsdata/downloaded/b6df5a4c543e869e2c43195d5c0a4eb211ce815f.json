She is represented by attorneys from the Innocence Project.\n\nSkahan is expected to rule on the petition for post-conviction relief on Nov. 18.\n\nThe body of Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Collins was found early morning in 1985 in Edmund Orgill Park. An autopsy showed she had been struck at least 100 times and strangled. She had been sexually assaulted and impaled with a tree branch.\n\nAlley initially denied any involvement, but later signed a statement admitting to killing Collins. Details of his statement contradicted the crime scene and autopsy, and a witness' description of a suspect didn't match Alley's physical appearance.\n\nLater, Alley would say he did not remember the crime and that he had been coerced into confessing.\n\nHe never stopped claiming innocence: Texas executes man in 1998 slaying of college student.\n\n\u201cThis has all the earmarks of a false confession,\u201d Scheck said. \u201cBut we need not debate it, because DNA evidence can provide us an answer.\u201d\n\nAlley was executed by lethal injection on June 28, 2006, with his daughter present at Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville.\n\nMarine Corps Lance Corporal Suzanne Collins, 19, was murdered in 1985 in Millington. More\n\nQuestions of Tennessee law at center of arguments\n\nSome of the arguments made Monday were arguments Scheck had made before, when Alley was still alive. Then, Scheck had argued that stains on the t-shirt that Collins was wearing and on her bra should be tested, as well as DNA from red underwear found by her body that the prosecution had argued belonged to the assailant.\n\nTennessee courts denied the petitions for DNA testing prior to Alley\u2019s execution, and much of the argument Monday centered around whether a 2011 ruling by the Tennessee Supreme Court \u2014 issued five years after Alley\u2019s execution \u2014 would have entitled him to DNA testing had he still been alive.\n\nScheck argued that the ruling was \u201cclear\u201d and that \u201cif (Alley) were alive today, he would get testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommon sense tells you that,\u201d Scheck said.\n\nAt 17 he was convicted for rape, murder: After 16 years in prison exonerated man will soon be a lawyer\n\nSteve Jones, assistant district attorney general, argued that the circumstances of that Tennessee Supreme Court ruling were different than Alley\u2019s case and that Alley already had full due process.\n\n\"He would not be entitled to post-conviction DNA testing if he were alive today,\" Jones said.\n\nJones also argued that Tennessee law guarantees a right to post-conviction relief for \"a person convicted or sentenced.\u201d In this case, the petition was filed by the estate for Sedley Alley, not the person, he said, making it not applicable.\n\nA tip led to renewed quest for DNA testing\n\nThe Innocence Project decided to become involved years after Alley\u2019s execution when it learned a man had been arrested for murder and previously charged with rape. That man had gone to the same training school as Collins and matched a suspect description, Scheck said. They also had suspicions about a boyfriend of Collins.\n\n\u201cWe got that communication and we asked that question: Oh my god, is the evidence still there?\u201d Scheck said.\n\nApril Alley, daughter of Sedley Alley, listens as Barry Scheck, Innocence Project co-director, speaks Monday, Oct. 14, 2019, during a hearing at the Shelby County courthouse in Memphis.
