Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement after the deal was announced.\n\nHe added\u201d \u201dThanks to their tenacity and the work of countless others, this will now occur faster than originally envisioned. This is a big win for children, workers and public health in California.\u201d\n\nWhen California announced earlier this year it was moving toward banning the pesticide, the state\u2019s environmental secretary, Jared Blumenfeld, said it was doing so because the federal government was allowing it to remain on the market.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump reversed an earlier effort by the Obama Administration to phase out chlorphyrifos.\n\n\u201cThe swift end to the sale of chlorpyrifos protects vulnerable communities by taking a harmful pesticide off the market,\u201d Blumenfeld said after the ban announcement.\n\nHe added that the agreement with its manufacturer \u201cavoids a protracted legal process while providing a clear timeline for California farmers as we look toward developing alternative pest management practices.\u201d\n\nThe pesticide has already been banned in Hawaii.\n\nChlorpyrifos\u2019 manufacturer, Corteva Agriscience, said in a statement that while it was not particularly pleased with the ban, the company reached the agreement \u201cin the best interests of the affected growers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough recent actions, the State of California has improvised and implemented several uniquely challenging regulatory requirements for chlorpyrifos. These new, novel requirements have made it virtually impossible for growers to use this important tool in their state,\u201d Corteva said.\n\nThe state said it is budgeting $5 million to help manufacturers develop safer alternatives.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A widely used agricultural pesticide that California environmental officials have said has been linked to brain damage in children will be banned after next year under an agreement reached with the manufacturer, state officials announced Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Rogers"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
