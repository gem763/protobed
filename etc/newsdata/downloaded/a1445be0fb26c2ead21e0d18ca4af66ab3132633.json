In response, Alan suggested that the two men brand the \u201cBall\u201d family name in order to create basketball and entertainment-related businesses. LaVar loved Alan\u2019s idea and wanted to make sure that he was the biggest star in the family, notwithstanding the fact that he was broke, had no savings, poor credit and zero business acumen.\"\n\n\"LaVar is a liar who fraudulently utilized BBB and BSG to fund his personal lifestyle,\" the docs state.\n\nFoster claims in the legal documents, he invested a substantial amount of his own money to launch the brands.
