This was a big job, so she enlisted the New York Times. And they did not disappoint.\n\nIn one of their most partisan, farfetched assaults on Republicans to date, the \u201cpaper of record\u201d summoned the age old adage \u201cAccuse your opponent of that which you are guilty.\u201d It sounds like one of Saul Alinsky\u2019s rules, but it dates back to at least World War II.\n\nIn an op-ed published on Friday entitled \u201cThe Crisis of the Republican Party: The G.O.P. will not be able to postpone a reckoning on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency for much longer,\u201d the editorial board excoriated Republicans for continuing to support President Trump. The cover photo shows the \u201cPeace Statue\u201d which is located near the U.S. Capitol and depicts \u201cGrief weeping on the shoulder of History.\u201d\n\nThe piece opens by comparing Republicans of today with those who allowed Sen. Joe McCarthy to continue his campaign against communism through their silence in the 1950s. The Times\u2019 editors write:\n\nThe Republican Party is again confronting a crisis of conscience, one that has been gathering force ever since Donald Trump captured the party\u2019s nomination in 2016. Afraid of his political influence, and delighted with his largely conservative agenda, party leaders have compromised again and again, swallowing their criticisms and tacitly if not openly endorsing presidential behavior they would have excoriated in a Democrat. Compromise by compromise, Donald Trump has hammered away at what Republicans once saw as foundational virtues: decency, honesty, responsibility. He has asked them to substitute loyalty to him for their patriotism itself.\u201d\n\nWhat Democrats have lost sight of is that Trump is not \u201clooking for dirt\u201d on an opponent. He has two very legitimate reasons for his inquiries.\n\nFirst, he\u2019s looking to hold people accountable for the grave injustice that was thrust upon him and which consumed the better part of his first term. There was a concerted effort to frame him for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. Those who are complicit are acutely aware of this. As they feel John Durham getting closer to the truth, they are panicking. For a time, they thought they\u2019d gotten away with it.\n\nThis was a perversion of justice on an epic scale. What sane person wouldn\u2019t want to discover who was involved and how it evolved? We need to expose this fraud so it doesn\u2019t happen to a future president.\n\nHillary Clinton, who commissioned the opposition research from which this whole narrative sprung, was until her defeat a master of manipulation. It no longer works for her. Last week, she tried to spin a false narrative around Tulsi Gabbard. Since by now Hillary\u2019s name has become synonymous with corruption, her effort was cut off at the knees.\n\nBut that how it starts. It\u2019s that easy. \u201cYou know, it sure looks like Trump is getting cozy with the Russians.\u201d When that message gets repeated over and over again by influential and respected government officials, and then agencies like the FBI and the CIA pick up the mantra, it takes on a life of its own.\n\nThen, enemies within Trump\u2019s own party see an opportunity to \u201cget back\u201d at him, it fans the flames even further. For example, one of Trump\u2019s bitter 2016 rivals, former Ohio John Kasich, jumped on the bandwagon this week to say, with great sadness of course, that he believes Trump\u2019s statements to Zelensky rise to the level of impeachment. In fact, the Times\u2019 editors wrote that Republicans should follow the lead of men like Kasich. They also suggested Justin Amash, best known as the only Republican Congressman to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment. Further, on the Fourth of July, Amash declared his \u201cindependence\u201d and left the Republican Party. The Times\u2019 choice of two of the President\u2019s most outspoken critics as leaders we should look to emulate speaks to the weakness of their argument.\n\nAnd second, Joe Biden leveraged $1 billion in U.S. aid to force Ukraine to fire the prosecutor who was about to question his son. Yes, I know, Biden claims the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was corrupt. However:\n\n1. Biden has no evidence of Shokin\u2019s corruption.\n\n2. Biden had a strong motive in silencing Shokin. Parents will go to great lengths to protect their children.\n\n3. Ukraine is known for corruption. If Shokin posed no threat to Biden, what was the point of insisting on a six-hour deadline. Why was it so urgent that he be fired immediately? If Shokin were corrupt, so were a thousand other Ukrainian officials. Why Shokin? Why immediately?\n\n4. Shokin appeared in a court of law where he signed a sworn affidavit stating otherwise.\n\n5. Biden has a history of both embellishing and even fabricating stories.\n\nThere are compelling reasons to suspect Biden of wrongdoing. Even if Biden were not running for President, there\u2019s more than enough smoke here to warrant an investigation.\n\nThe editorial says:\n\nThere was a time when Republicans like Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said that soliciting foreign election assistance would be improper. But most congressional Republicans have taken to avoiding such questions as the evidence against Mr. Trump has piled up.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about soliciting foreign election assistance. Hillary Clinton and the DNC commissioned a Washington op-research firm, Fusion GPS, to hire former British spy Christopher Steele to tap his foreign contacts to compile an unverified document of stories about candidate Trump (truth not required). This spy had his foreign information hand delivered to the FBI by the fourth highest ranking DOJ official, Bruce Ohr, who acted as the backchannel. Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie Ohr, was an independent contractor who worked for Fusion GPS to dig up dirt during 2016 on members of the Trump family. Testifying under oath before Congress, Nellie Ohr admitted much of her information came from a Ukrainian source. She put together a dossier of her own in the summer of 2016 which her husband delivered to the FBI on a thumbdrive.\n\nThe owner of Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, had several Russian clients, one of whom was Natalia Veselnitskaya, one of the Russians who initiated and attended the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump, Jr. in June 2016. Simpson had dinner with Veselnitskaya the night before the meeting and after the meeting.\n\nAlthough it hasn\u2019t been definitely proven yet, evidence suggests the FBI sent spies into the Trump campaign. They arranged for Joseph Mifsud to meet with George Papadopoulos in Rome and London. This information will become more clear after the IG report is released which is said to be this week. A full accounting of everything that occurred on foreign soil is beyond the scope of this post, but it is vast. And it allowed the perpetrators to circumvent U.S. laws.\n\nThe editors continue:\n\nYet Republicans will not be able to postpone a reckoning with Trumpism for much longer. The investigation by House Democrats appears likely to result in a vote for impeachment, despite efforts by the White House to obstruct the inquiry.\n\nSo do it. Go ahead and impeach him. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi likely has the votes. What is her hesitation? As most of us are aware, the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is not even official because Pelosi has refused to hold a vote on the House floor to open it. She called a press conference to announce her impeachment inquiry, yet she won\u2019t pull the trigger. On Friday, she announced that she \u201cwould not be holding a vote anytime soon.\u201d\n\nShe has several good reasons for not doing so. First, it will leave Democratic members of Congress from districts where Trump won vulnerable. Second, once a formal floor vote is taken to open an impeachment inquiry, Republicans, who have been shut out of the process entirely, would gain the power to issue subpoenas and to question witnesses. The Democrats are very happy with their unofficial unilateral impeachment. Third, once the House votes to impeach, they will lose control of the narrative. The impeachment inquiry would be then in the hands of the Senate. The House Democrats would become irrelevant. And the matter would be treated much differently by the Republican controlled Senate.\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s framers envisioned America\u2019s political leaders as bound by a devotion to country above all else. That\u2019s why all elected officials take an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. By protecting Donald Trump at all costs from all consequences, the Republicans risk violating that sacred oath.\n\nPlease don\u2019t lecture us about sacred oaths and devotion to country. Your words are hypocritical, misguided and pathetic. Nothing is sacred to Nancy Pelosi or her front man, Adam Schiff, except for their insatiable hunger for power. Democrats don\u2019t love America, nor do they respect the rule of law.\n\nThey\u2019ve tried everything they could possibly conceive of to destroy this man. They were counting on Special Counsel Robert Mueller to deliver for them. When his investigation failed to result in an indictment, they chose Ukraine-gate.\n\nOur founders never intended for impeachment to be used as a political tool for one party to take power from another. It was \u201csupposed to be reserved for truly abominable misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times has jumped the shark. Perhaps it happened when they tried to rewrite history with the launch of the 1691 project. Or maybe before.\n\nAlong the way, the left forgot one of Alinsky\u2019s most important rules. \u201cA tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.\u201d\n\nThis fraud has dragged on too long.\n\nBarr and Durham are closing in, and they will be exposed.\n\nAnd, like they say, history will remember it.\n\nRepublicans face a simple question: is the president allowed to pressure a foreign country into interfering in our elections? History will remember their answer, or their silence. #TruthExposed https://t.co/ps02g1AlYL \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) October 20, 2019", "description": "Open Letter to Nancy Pelosi and the New York Times; \u2018A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag\u2019", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Nick Arama", "Kira Davis", "Alex Parker", "Stu Cvrk", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AP_080722043710-e1565071414763.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
