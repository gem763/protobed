Tax incentives\n\nPerhaps one of the most attractive changes that could be made is new tax incentives for landlords, according to Mr Cox.\n\nProperty investors have faced punitive tax measures in recent years, including a three per cent stamp duty surcharge and the phased reduction of tax relief on mortgage interest.\n\nTax incentives could be introduced for landlords benefiting tenants, such as those providing longer-term tenancies.\n\nThis could include reinstating the tax reliefs that landlords can claim on their mortgage interest.\n\n2. Open database for rogue landlords\n\nIn April last year, the Government introduced a database for rogue landlords and lettings agents.\n\nHowever, the problem is that only local authorities can currently see it. Mr Cox called for everyone \u2013 including tenants \u2013 to be able to see it, saying: 'Otherwise, what is the point.'\n\nEarlier in the month, This is Money revealed how the register has just 12 names on it.\n\nThe Government has previously cited concerns about data protection but is now consulting on opening up the database.\n\n3. Licensing of estate agents\n\nCurrently, anyone can become an estate agent.\n\nBut at some point in the future they are expected to obtain a license before they can buy and sell homes.\n\nIt's been on the agenda for years and the industry is largely supportive of such a move.\n\nMr Cox said: 'The previous government said it was committed to the new licensing and it is the right thing to do as it will clean up the industry and its reputation.\n\n'We hope that the new government will take it forward.'\n\n4. Reform court system\n\nIt can take months to evict a tenant under the current system and the Government has previously said it is looking to ban Section 21.\n\nThis would ban landlords from evicting a tenant with no reason at short notice - obviously something that would appeal to tenants.\n\nHowever, this would inevitably put further pressure on the current eviction process and introduce costly delays for landlords.\n\nBy introducing dedicated housing courts, the time that it would take for landlords to gain possession of a property could be cut considerably.\n\n5. Introduce a property MOT\n\nProperties, like cars, could become subject to an annual MOT to ensure they meet statutory requirements.\n\nIt would mean that local councils could get rid of much more expensive licensing schemes that are currently in place and improve enforcement.\n\nA property MOT would give landlords a steer on what maintenance they need to do and it would improve the health of a property for tenants.\n\nMr Cox said: 'This could be a massive step forward. It would be replacing the old regulation that doesn't work, with one that does. And it would be much more effective in maintaining standards.'", "description": "A leading buy-to-let expert has given his views on how to improve the rental market.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/12/12/17184760-0-image-a-4_1565609486093.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
