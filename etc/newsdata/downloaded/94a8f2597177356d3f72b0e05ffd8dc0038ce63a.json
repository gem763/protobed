I don't think so. He has made life perfect for them.\n\nThe fear coming into the season was that his terrible form of last year \u2013 no wins, zilch, nada \u2013 might continue, thus cranking up the old narrative that he isn't up to the job and needs replacing.\n\nThat he has shown better form \u2013 two wins, two runners-up places and one fastest lap in the first four races \u2013 makes Mercedes' task of retaining the constructors' championship easier. All the questions about who should partner Lewis Hamilton in 2020 are wiped away.\n\nValtteri Bottas has made life perfect for Mercedes ahead of next season with his Baku victory\n\nAh, people say, it is the start of an intra-team rivalry that will end up in the acrimony that blighted \u2013 or enriched, depending on your view \u2013 the Hamilton-Nico Rosberg years. I doubt it for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Hamilton will have the measure of Bottas comfortably long before the climax of the season. The Finn, I believe, is a good peddler, no mug at all, but when Hamilton turns on the afterburners as he customarily only does when the competition enters an advanced stage rather than in the opening races of little tangible meaning, he will blow his team-mate away.\n\nSecondly, Bottas does not possess the same capacity as Rosberg to rile Hamilton. He is not so calculating, or at least appears not to be. Nor does he have the air of privilege that Hamilton perceived and resented in Rosberg.\n\n'I come from a not great place and lived on a couch in my dad's apartment \u2013 and Nico grew up with jets and hotels and boats,' Hamilton once said. Their relationship was a festering sore with plenty of history.\n\nMy prediction: Lewis will claim victory in all but one of the rest of the races Mercedes win and have the title wrapped up with at least two rounds to spare. Bottas will be kept on for another year. Joy at Mercedes unbounded.\n\nBottas has proved he has the talent as well as a personality that suits the team dynamic\n\nA word of tribute to Max Verstappen. Somewhat under the radar, he is simply driving well \u2013 no dramas, no tantrums. If Red Bull improve as the season goes on, he will have the perfect chance to showcase his talent.\n\nHe might even make the argument to replace Hamilton at Mercedes when the then seven-time world champion leaves for Ferrari the season after next. I thought that might wake you up.\n\nMax Verstappen is, under the radar, having a very good season and is driving very well\n\nSome crazy websites reported a rumour that Nico Rosberg had been banned from the paddock for handing his pass to one of his own media team in China a fortnight ago.\n\nSuch transgressions are taken very seriously by the accreditation police - but bar a world champion from the epicentre of his sport? I don't think so.\n\nAfter investigation, it can be reported that Rosberg categorically was not banned. He was just never due to attend Baku, so his absence should have been unremarkable. He was instead happily relaxing in Ibiza. From there, he posted his insight on the race to his growing social media following.\n\nHe will return to his part-time TV duties in Monaco next month, as he always planned. With his usual paddock pass, naturally.\n\nReports that Nico Rosberg was banned from the paddock in Baku were way off the mark\n\nA new one at security in Baku airport. The frisker recoiled as he patted me down. 'What's this?' he asked, thinking he had found something potentially dangerous on me. 'Er, my ribs.'", "description": "JONATHAN MCEVOY\u2019S F1 COLUMN: Valtteri Bottas has given Mercedes a headache after his victory in Baku on Sunday? I don't think so.
