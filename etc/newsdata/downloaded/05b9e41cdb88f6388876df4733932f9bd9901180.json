(Stan Barouh)\n\nDon\u2019t tell Mama, but the Kit Kat Klub has gained a little class. The central setting and anchoring idea for the musical \u201cCabaret\u201d still harbors the requisite louche personalities and risque song-and-dance acts. Fishnet-stocking suppliers aren\u2019t hurting for business. But in director Alan Paul\u2019s smart, tangy production at Olney Theatre Center, there\u2019s slightly less of the pointed sleaze that has suffused other iterations of the Weimar Berlin nightspot. It\u2019s a prudent calibration that ultimately reinforces the theme of a society\u2019s disastrous and willful moral myopia.\n\nThe production\u2019s attractive scenic and musical conception allows us to feel, rather than simply observe, the lure of that myopia. The fine-sounding orchestra \u2014 11 musicians, including music director Christopher Youstra \u2014 basks at center stage, among crystal chandeliers and red-satin-draped music stands. With a harp as an eye-catching presence, the setup evokes cocktail hour in a 1930s movie. (Wilson Chin is the scenic designer.) How tempting it would be to succumb to the elegant diversion and ignore inconvenient truths, namely, the rise of Nazism.\n\nThat political development looms throughout the musical, which is based on John Van Druten\u2019s play \u201cI Am a Camera\u201d and stories by Christopher Isherwood. Originally on Broadway in 1966, with music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb and book by Joe Masteroff, \u201cCabaret\u201d depicts American writer Clifford Bradshaw (Gregory Maheu) arriving in Weimar Berlin, where he takes up with the vibrantly dissipated showgirl Sally Bowles (Alexandra Silber). Amid the debauchery of the milieu, ugly incidents presage the Nazi takeover.\n\n\n\nGregory Maheu as Clifford Bradshaw and Alexandra Silber as Sally Bowles. (Stan Barouh)\n\nBoth the decadence and the ominous political and social conditions find expression in the musical\u2019s cabaret acts, performed principally by Sally (the saucy \u201cDon\u2019t Tell Mama,\u201d etc.) and the Kit Kat Klub\u2019s insinuating Emcee (Mason Alexander Park), who concludes \u201cIf You Could See Her,\u201d an arch song and pas de deux with a performer in gorilla costume, by noting that, in his eyes, his beloved doesn\u2019t \u201clook Jewish at all.\u201d The Olney production has a major asset in Park\u2019s Emcee, who exudes not only the necessary lewdness, but also a childishness and vulnerability, which adds emotional punch while echoing the sense of a society teetering on the edge. Sporting glitter eye shadow, this Emcee salaciously caresses the harp. He looks downcast when his jokes fizzle. In numbers such as the provocative opener \u201cWillkommen,\u201d he sings in brassy, smoky tones, frequently letting a snarl creep in.\n\nMaheu nails Cliff\u2019s appealing earnestness and fallibility. Silber (Guenevere in Paul\u2019s \u201cCamelot\u201d at Shakespeare Theatre Company) captures Sally\u2019s jittery desperation \u2014 as when she invades Cliff\u2019s room and shimmies on his sofa \u2014 but her cabaret numbers don\u2019t pop as much as they should.\n\nIn a story arc that adds aching poignancy, Donna Migliaccio packs humor and solidity into landlady Fr\u00e4ulein Schneider, who is wooed by Herr Schultz, a gentle Jewish fruit merchant. Mitchell H\u00e9bert is marvelously funny and endearing as Schultz, even though his singing is tentative at best.\n\nIn other contributions, Tom Story is serviceable as the weaselly Ernst Ludwig; costume designer Kendra Rai revels in the cabaret performers\u2019 outre garb; and orchestra member Andrew Axelrad supplies a golden sax solo. The execution of Katie Spelman\u2019s vamping choreography is often imperfectly synced, although the look arguably suits the seediness more frequently associated with the Kit Kat Klub. A high-kick sequence that turns into a goose-step is one of the rare too-blunt moments in a production that otherwise moves astutely, as well as fluidly.\n\nA simple coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre in the production\u2019s final moments (no spoilers here) underscores the show\u2019s all-too-timely vision of civic and political blindness. In the audience, we take stock of ourselves. Did we find too much welcome in the \u201cWillkommen\u201d?\n\nCabaret, book by Joe Masteroff, music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb.
