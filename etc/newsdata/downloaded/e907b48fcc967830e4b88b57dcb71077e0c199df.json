Nicky Morgan, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media, and sport, says the government \u201cwill not be commencing\u201d Part 3 of the Digital Economy Act 2017 \u2014 which would have required internet users to prove they were over 18 before viewing pornographic sites. Instead, it will focus on protecting children through \u201cwider online harms proposals.\u201d\n\nThe porn ban was already widely considered dead. It was shelved indefinitely in July, following multiple delayed deadlines. Critics pointed to potential privacy issues with the proposal, as well as the outsized power it could have given porn conglomerate MindGeek, which was set to provide its age verification system. But it\u2019s now officially been abandoned.\n\nMorgan states that \u201cthe government\u2019s commitment to protecting children online is unwavering,\u201d and she suggests that some form of age-gating porn access is still in the cards. \u201cWe are committed to the UK becoming a world-leader in the development of online safety technology and to ensure companies of all sizes have access to, and adopt, innovative solutions to improve the safety of their users. This includes age verification tools and we expect them to continue to play a key role in protecting children online,\u201d Morgan writes.\n\nMorgan also noted that the UK is continuing with other plans based on the Online Harms White Paper published in April. The white paper outlines a \u201cduty of care\u201d that internet companies would bear to prevent illegal activity, and it covers far more issues than pornography \u2014 it\u2019s focused on bullying, terrorism, and general abuse of social media. The Queen\u2019s Speech, delivered earlier this week, stated that the government will publish draft legislation based on its proposals.", "description": "A UK plan to require age verification before accessing pornographic websites has been dropped in favor of unspecified \"wider online harms proposals.\" The proposal had already been delayed several times.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gkHty1jMyMJVUqSYmXtLj5gyCgo=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10262381/jbareham_180207_2293_0057.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
