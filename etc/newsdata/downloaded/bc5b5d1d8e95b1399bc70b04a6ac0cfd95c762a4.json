However, despite contacting Vodafone on Twitter on Sunday and Monday morning, his service is still not working.\n\n\"This is my professional phone so it's big trouble for me,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Twitter\n\nVodafone said: \"We are very sorry that some customers could not use their phones yesterday, when roaming abroad. This was due to a technical error, which we have now fixed.\n\n\"Some customers are receiving billing messages in error; we are working through these as an urgent priority and are removing any errors from customer accounts. Customers will not be charged and do not need to worry about contacting us as we are proactively checking accounts.\"\n\nIn August, a similar issue affected Three Ireland. The mobile operator had to apologise after a system upgrade error added bogus roaming fees to customers' bills and suspended their services.", "description": "Glitch sees customers abroad hit with thousands of pounds of charges and unable to use their phones.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13E72/production/_109222518_mobile-roaming1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
