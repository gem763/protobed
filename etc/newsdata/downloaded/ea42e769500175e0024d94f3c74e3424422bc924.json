The 5,893-square-foot condo has five bedrooms, two staff rooms, a library and views over the East River.\n\n\n\nThe second most expensive deal was for a unit at Midtown\u2019s 90-story One57, last asking $17.5 million, reduced from $19 million. The four-bedroom condo spans 3,466 square feet and has views of Central Park.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Preparing Napa Valley Wine for Climate Change\n\nOf the 16 contracts signed last week, 13 were condos, two were co-ops and one was a condop; no luxury townhouses entered contract.\n\n\n\nAn unusually high number of high-priced townhouses have transacted in recent weeks as sellers appear more willing to negotiate on price. Until two weeks ago, townhouses had accounted for all the highest priced deals since June.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-103288?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280"}
