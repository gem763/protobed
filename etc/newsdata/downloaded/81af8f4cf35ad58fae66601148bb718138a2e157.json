Last year, the company sparked controversy with a \u201csexy Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d costume, and earlier this month Yandy began generating its annual Halloween buzz with a Sexy Mr. Rogers costume ahead of the November release of the upcoming Tom Hanks flick, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\n\nNow Yandy is back and ready to immortalize one of the most iconic symbols of Hot Girl Summer in a glorious two-piece spandex tribute. The unofficial White Claw costume, called the \u201cHard Outlaw\u201d on Yandy\u2019s site (you know, copyright stuff), consists of a skin tight white two-piece, branded with a thinly veiled White Claw logo and the phrase \u201cOutlaw, Party Hard.\u201d\n\nA Yandy rep told ELLE the costume has been in the works for some time now. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge trend in spiked seltzer drinks and they are wildly popular with our team, too,\u201d Alicia Thompson, Yandy\u2019s director of brand marketing, told the magazine. \u201cThis costume was created in a two-piece bodysuit style and uses the popular hashtag trending on social.\u201d\n\nThe hashtag Thompson refers to is \u201c#darty,\u201d slang for \u201cday party,\u201d which appears on the back of the costume.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s up for a day party?\u201d reads the official costume description. \u201cLay down the law of liquid refreshments. Life is hard to handle without that five percent bubbly buzz.\u201d\n\nWe couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at ELLE", "description": "As concerns about a potential White Claw shortage continue to mount, Yandy has blessed us with a solution in the form of a sexy White Claw Halloween costume.", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Yandy-White-Claw-Costume.png?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
