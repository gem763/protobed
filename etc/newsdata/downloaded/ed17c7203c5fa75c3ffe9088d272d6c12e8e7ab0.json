You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt is his weeks of lies about why he prorogued parliament that landed his government in the Supreme Court. And yet, now, somewhat awkwardly, he appears to have decided the way out of it is to start telling a variation on the actual truth. Rookie mistake.\n\nAnyway, before we demean our basic dignity yet again, and concern ourselves with the details of today\u2019s most recent phase of the never-ending turbo s***show that is the Johnson government, a tiny bit of background.\n\nIt\u2019s August 28th. News breaks that Jacob Rees-Mogg has been to see the Queen at Balmoral and instructed her to prorogue parliament. This is immediately, and correctly, viewed as a move to stop parliament legislating to prevent no-deal Brexit, and thus the Queen has been lied to.\n\nSo the prime minister calls a TV camera and news reporter into Downing Street, and smirks his way through two full minutes of lies, about how this has all got nothing to do with Brexit. \u201cWe need a Queen\u2019s Speech to get on with our exciting domestic agenda,\u201d he lies.\n\nHis smirk, at that moment, seemed to be his way of acknowledging that he knew he was lying. That his \u201cdomestic agenda\u201d, which would be part of this Queen\u2019s Speech, stands absolutely no chance of getting anywhere because he doesn\u2019t have a parliamentary majority.\n\nOver the next few weeks, other Tories will be dispatched over the airwaves to maintain this lie. That this is all perfectly ordinary, that we need a new Queen\u2019s Speech. It\u2019s all fine.\n\nIt was important, back then, not to let slip that, as is crushingly obvious, the prorogation was for absolutely no other reason than to seek to frustrate parliament, and its attempts to legislate to prevent no-deal Brexit.\n\nAll of which, at least for someone biologically capable of feeling actual shame, and the prime minister is no such person, would potentially make it somewhat awkward, three weeks later, to instruct your lawyer to stand up in the Supreme Court, whilst watched by millions, and explain how proroguing parliament for explicitly political reasons is absolutely fine, and here\u2019s all the times it\u2019s been done before.\n\nLord Keen, with his horn-rimmed spectacles and detachable collared shirts, bears more than a passing resemblance to the fearsome, nameless \u201cblue-haired lawyer\u201d from The Simpsons, but his big day in court was a rather more Lionel Hutz-like experience.\n\nIn 1930, when Ramsay MacDonald prorogued parliament, he explained: \u201cOne might observe that it was clear that the executive wanted to avoid scrutiny because it didn\u2019t command the confidence of the house.\u201d\n\nThen there was 1948, he carried on, when parliament was prorogued to force a bill to be passed. \u201cThis last example was clearly for a party political purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a naked political reason.\u201d\n\nAll of which is undoubtedly true. It\u2019s just that your lad Boris Johnson, sitting a hundred yards away in his office in 10 Downing Street, keeps, keeps telling people he\u2019s only done it for his \u201cexciting domestic agenda\u201d, his new police officers that keep fainting on him and publicly disowning him and so on \u2013 and here you are in court saying it\u2019s all nakedly political, and that\u2019s absolutely fine.\n\nStill, Lord Keen wasn\u2019t done here. We would also learn that prorogation was in fact parliament\u2019s own fault. \u201cIf parliament did not want to be prorogued for longer than the specified period then it could and presumably would have said so,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich is all very well. It\u2019s just that some of us were there at 1am last week when a large number of members of that parliament tried to pin the speaker to his chair to stop him leaving, and started staging an actual rally in the chamber because, in your own words, Lord Keen, it very clearly did not want to be prorogued for longer than the specified period, and it could and indeed was saying so.\n\nIt was even writing so, on bits of paper, and waving them about while singing The Red Flag. It is fair to say that not many of the Supreme Court judges were impressed. Eyebrows were raised. Surprise was expressed. That is what counts as a savaging in these quarters.\n\nBy the time cases reach this, the very highest court of the land, they are beyond contesting or establishing the facts of what might have happened, and are matters of pure law.\n\nAt the start of the day the government was very much expected to win the case, and it may well be that has not changed. The reason for this is that, though the prorogation may have been something of a sharp practice, it was not for the courts to say it was or wasn\u2019t illegal. That it isn\u2019t \u201cjusticiable\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis court is not being asked to specify what would be a valid period of prorogation,\u201d Lord Keen told them. That if prorogation had been extended for nakedly political intent, that\u2019s fine and there\u2019s nothing they can do about it.\n\nWhich, we will come to discover, may or may not be true. But in the meantime, there is also the court of public opinion to consider. And the question they have to ponder is this? Does it matter that the prime minister\u2019s own defence in court is that he\u2019s been lying through his teeth non-stop for three weeks?\n\nWell, it\u2019s 2019 now, so the answer to that is probably \u201cnot one bit\u201d. But at least it\u2019s nice to have it on record.", "description": "Could it in fact have been a moment of far-sighted genius on the part of Boris Johnson, that with the television cameras pointed at him a fortnight ago, he spectacularly forgot the words police officers use when they arrest someone?
