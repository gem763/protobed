(AP) - In the spirit of the 19th century Little Harbor artist colony, photographer Susan Bank and her neurologist husband \u201cWilli\u201d have transformed their 1861 home and Little Harbor property into an art-filled and flotsam-covered explosion of competing eye candy.\n\nIt\u2019s the barn one notices first.\n\nAt the end of an unpaved driveway, shielded from public view by a grove of trees, the weathered red barn is decorated with shoes, hubcaps, a pair of Mercedes grills, rusted gears, buoys, an old stop sign, a skull-and-crossbones flag and an old oar. Fishing net and rope were shaped and hammered onto barnboard by Willi, into the form of a mermaid, with a snorkeling fin for a tail and a pair of orange maritime floats for bosoms.\n\nOn the grounds where they\u2019ve lived since 1972, there\u2019s a pet cemetery, a face on the side of a tree and driftwood sculptures. Six shoes are mounted onto a sheet of rusted metal the couple calls \u201cthe six tenors,\u201d given their likeness to a row of singing men.\n\n\u201cWe love that,\u201d Susan said. \u201cIt was made by one of our tenants.\u201d\n\nPropped among granite glacial boulders is a vintage child\u2019s rocking horse. Nearby, there\u2019s an outdoor shower, with a sheet of fabric printed with animal heads wearing pink glasses, to block views from the nearby street.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s lovely,\u201d Willi explained as the reason for adding an al fresco bathing feature.\n\nSusan said she found the shower head at a barn sale for $5 and is prone to picking castaways wherever they catch her eye. Inside their home, built for Gen. Richard Waldron as a honeymoon cottage, found objects are elevated to high-art status.\n\nA rusted eel spear, a pair of old boxing gloves and paintings by their daughter Greta flank the antique-brick kitchen hearth. There are decoys, a vintage leather fireman\u2019s helmet and a table made from an old wood washing machine. Handmade paper mache masks, from a bygone Portsmouth Halloween Parade, peer down from a high shelf. A Russell Cheney painting of the Portsmouth waterfront hangs among others made by family members.\n\nOn the porch, overlooking Sagamore Creek, the roof is supported with original \u201cship\u2019s knees\u201d braces, under which Susan practices yoga.\n\nSusan was born in 1938 at Cottage Hospital in Portsmouth and her husband is celebrating his 85th birthday this weekend. She grew up in New Castle, \u201cthat was my village,\u201d when she was Susan Sweetster, a family name linked to the local Coolidges.\n\nA 1956 graduate of Portsmouth High School, Susan took up photography at age 60 and has since won multiple awards for her books of haunting black-and-and-white images from 25 trips to Cuba, each weeks at a time.\n\n\u201cI lived in the countryside with the tobacco farmers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people were wonderful and accessible.\u201d\n\nHer first photo book in 2008, \u201cCuba:Camp Adentro,\u201d was hailed by the late photography legend Robert Frank as \u201cextraordinary, full of life.\u201d She shoots with a Leica M6 camera and black-and-white film, her books printed on lush German paper.\n\n\u201cI got a digital Fuji X100 and I can\u2019t figure the damn thing out,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t got the hang of it yet.\u201d\n\nHer second book, \u201cPiercing the Darkness,\u201d also features images from Cuba, she knows the names of the people pictured on the pages and still communicates with some of them. One of her landlords was a gravedigger, she said, and he introduced her to many locals.\n\nBank said she took many photos in Cuban bars and could have done a series on a Cuban hairdresser who had the largest Santa Barbara in Havana in his salon. Her image of a boy bicycling through line-drying laundry, she said, \u201cis really a metaphor for transition.\u201d\n\nBank said she regrets not making a photo collection of her suitcases en route to Cuba those 25 times. She\u2019d stuff them with fancy mustard, salamis, aspirin and Parmesan cheese, all gifts for the locals.\n\n\u201cAnd what was their favorite gift?\u201d her husband prompted. \u201cThe blue pills.\u201d\n\n\u201cViagra,\u201d Susan affirmed, was another gift she delivered from the states.\n\nHer husband said when he joined her on some Cuban trips, he was struck by how people would flock to her.\n\nHer book \u201cSalisbury Beach\u201d is a collection of images of teenagers under seaside piers, in a pool hall and entwined on a dock next to a hardpack of cigarettes.\n\n\u201cI worked there for quite a while,\u201d she said. \u201cI got to know the locals very well and I loved the teenagers. I\u2019m not threatening. I\u2019m short, I have gray hair and I don\u2019t have a lot of equipment.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019s never been inspired to do a photo series of Portsmouth, though did spend a great deal of time taking pictures at the commercial fish pier.\n\nWilli Bank is a Holocaust survivor, worked as a neurologist and was a ship doctor on a boat during the \u201cPerfect Storm\u201d of 1991. He\u2019s credited with adding the flair to the family barn, where he has an oil painting studio and paints local landscapes, including the nearby Wentworth Coolidge Mansion. He hand built a pram and keeps a sloop in Little Harbor.\n\nThe couple\u2019s twin sons, David and Willi, age 55, have strong local maritime ties. David built a Strawbery Banke dory, ran the Strawbery Banke boat shop and was the first captain of the local gundalow, his parents said. Willi captained the Massachusetts Maritime Academy ship \u201cRanger\u201d and an American flag he made from string lights, for a boat parade, now hangs on the side of his parent\u2019s Little Harbor barn.\n\nTheir daughter Greta teaches art at the Maine College of Art.\n\n\u201cThey all like to be here,\u201d Susan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gathering place for my family.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2mg9xrU\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Portsmouth Herald, http://www.seacoastonline.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In the spirit of the 19th century Little Harbor artist colony, photographer Susan Bank and her neurologist husband \"Willi\" have transformed their 1861 home and Little Harbor property into an art-filled and flotsam-covered explosion of competing eye candy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Elizabeth Dinan"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
