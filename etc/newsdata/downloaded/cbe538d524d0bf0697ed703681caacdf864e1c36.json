Where are we, what\u2019s happening here?\u2019\u201d said Daniel Tommie, 57, a Seminole tribe member.\n\nTommie works in the Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki museum, 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of Hollywood, in the Big Cypress Indian reservation in the Everglades wetlands.\n\n\u201cFinancially there are some tribes that wanted to stay away from gaming because they saw the negative effects \u2026 There is too much crime coming to the reservation, too many elders spending all their money,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo I think the important thing is to enjoy that success, but to remember how we got here. Because if you lose your way I\u2019m not sure what will happen.\u201d", "description": "Hollywood (United States) (AFP) \u2013 Shaped like an electric guitar, the soaring, blue-glass, 36-story Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is a gamble that its", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/982772_seminole-hard-rock-hotel-casino-in-florida-built-by-seminole-tribe-wealthy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
