(Peter and Maria Hoey/for The Washington Post)\n\nMore than 200 years after George Washington delivered his farewell address to the nation, his onetime presence at a property remains a selling point.\n\n\u201cWe always research every historic home to find out the story about who lived there or who visited there,\u201d says Phyllis Patterson, a senior vice president with TTR Sotheby\u2019s International Realty in Old Town Alexandria. \u201cAny house that has anything to do with George Washington usually sells faster than other historic homes.\u201d\n\nVirginia is not the only place where a Washington connection affects sales.\n\n\u201cPeople came from all over the country to see a house that was for sale in the Germantown neighborhood in Philadelphia because George Washington spent the summer there one year,\u201d says Louise D\u2019Alessandro, an associate broker with Elfant Wissahickon Realtors in Philadelphia.\n\nHistory buffs from around the country and globe may visit historic homes, but buyers are typically local, says D\u2019Alessandro, at least in Philadelphia.\n\nThe history of a house will ultimately be most important and relevant to the person who buys the house, says Theresa Burt, an associate broker with Washington Fine Properties and Georgetown resident.\n\n\u201cWhen selling the house, an agent must be careful about the marketing,\u201d Burt said. \u201cThe decision regarding to include the history of the house in pre-marketing depends upon the story \u2014 is it sensational? Salacious? Helpful or hurtful to the sale? What if a prominent political family lived in the home?\u201d\n\nWhen researching the history of one of her recent listings, Burt learned the home had been a saloon famous among sea captains and later a small hospital during the Civil War.\n\n\u201cSimply interesting, sad or perhaps too dramatic for the imagination of today\u2019s buyer,\u201d she said. \u201cOne needs to be sensitive to the story. We research the history of the house and provide it to potential buyers, if they are interested. There\u2019s a difference between promoting the history and making it available upon request.\u201d\n\nHistoric houses sometimes take longer to sell than more modern ones because old houses require more maintenance and can have preservation restrictions.\n\nDetermining a sale price for a historic home can be challenging, as comparable properties to use for comparisons may not exist.\n\n\u201cLots of people see more value in older homes because of their architecture and history, but some people err on the side of caution because a historic designation can limit the work that homeowners can do or make it more expensive,\u201d says Renee Peres, a real estate agent with Compass in Washington.\n\nStories about previous residents can entice potential buyers, but the architectural and historical details are what convert visitors to owners, says Leslie Brenowitz, a real estate agent also with Compass in the District.\n\n\u201cBuyers are looking for the features that you don\u2019t see today, such as turrets and transoms and thick walls,\u201d says Brenowitz. \u201cThey want to see the original fireplaces and millwork.\u201d\n\nBrenowitz and Peres are selling a single-family home in the LeDroit Park neighborhood of Northwest Washington, one of 50 remaining homes designed by architect James McGill between 1873 and 1883.\n\n\u201cThe neighborhood is a historic district, which has attracted some out-of-state buyers, but we don\u2019t know much about the previous owners of this house,\u201d says Peres. \u201cWe\u2019re finding that the more typical buyer of a historic home is someone who appreciates the architecture and knows they can\u2019t afford to build something like this today.\u201d\n\nThe buyer pool for older homes in Old Town Alexandria, says Patterson, is limited to people who want to own and preserve a historic landmark and have the means to do that.\n\n\u201cBuyers want a story, but they also want a house with a renovated kitchen and bathrooms,\u201d says Patterson. \u201cAlong with the original floors, doors and fireplaces, they ideally want some green space accessible from an open kitchen and family room.\u201d\n\nIf a home in Old Town has off-street parking, that can easily add $100,000 to the price, Patterson says.\n\n\u201cWe market historic homes to people who buy antiques through Sotheby\u2019s, to members of groups with an interest in history and internationally, too,\u201d says Patterson.\n\nSelling a historic house can be more complex because older homes can have more structural issues that must be disclosed to buyers, and they often come with easements and historic regulations that may affect what a buyer can do to the home.\n\n\u201cHomeowners usually want a historic designation for their house because [they think] it adds to the home\u2019s value, but it also restricts them,\u201d says Patterson.\n\nHistoric houses can be less valuable than a more modern home because of the constraints on remodeling and the expense of renovations, agents say. Historic houses often lack parking and are less likely to have the open floor plan preferred by today\u2019s buyers.\n\nPatterson says exterior renovations to houses in Old Town Alexandria must be reviewed by the Board of Architectural Review. Owners of homes within the historic district face more limitations.\n\n\u201cHistoric homes need specialists and craftsmen with experience to work on them, and sometimes an engineer needs to be consulted to make sure that the home is structurally sound,\u201d says Patterson.\n\nAppraisers don\u2019t factor in a property\u2019s historic status when determining the valuation, says D\u2019Alessandro.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chance that a property with too many easements could appraise lower, but generally we price properties based on nearby homes in a comparable condition,\u201d says D\u2019Alessandro. \u201cJust like any other house, a historic house that\u2019s priced right will sell faster.\u201d\n\nIn LeDroit Park\u2019s historic district, homeowners must preserve the facade, street view and roof line of the homes, which means they can\u2019t expand with a pop-up extension, says Brenowitz.\n\n\u201cThe materials to restore the exterior also have to be consistent with the original house,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes that costs more, such as installing wood windows, but sometimes it can cost less. A concrete porch is less expensive than a brick porch, for example.\u201d\n\nGrants are available from nonprofit organizations and local governments to help homeowners preserve historic homes, says Peres.\n\nInsurance costs for a historic home may be higher than average depending on the location, construction and materials of the property, says Patterson. Not every insurance company offers coverage for historic homes, so buyers need to investigate insurance costs before finalizing their purchase.\n\nPurchasers of historic homes take on more than an ownership role: They are responsible for maintaining history. Before the National Trust for Historic Preservation sells its properties, buyers go through interviews about their intentions for it.\n\n\u201cBuying a home in a historic neighborhood or that has a historic designation from a local, state or national organization typically means you can\u2019t alter the exterior,\u201d says Peres. \u201cWhen you do an interior renovation, it\u2019s best to be thoughtful about the historic integrity of the home for future resale value. While a new kitchen and bathrooms are important, it\u2019s also smart to be consistent with the rest of the house and to honor its history.\u201d", "description": "While many think a notable lineage increases a home\u2019s value, historic structures also come with easements, higher insurance costs and complex structural issues.", "authors": ["Michele Lerner", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NNPScQ9OLNJSmN5EjrY87MEw1cQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CHHPB4G5P4I6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
