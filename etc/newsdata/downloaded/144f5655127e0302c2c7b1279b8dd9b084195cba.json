This past week, he\u2019s been spotted not once, but twice with the model Kaia Gerber, best known as Cindy Crawford\u2019s 18-year-old daughter. (Because you\u2019re wondering: Davidson is 25.) But does that mean something\u2019s going on between the two? Are these hangouts, or perhaps dates? Have they \u2026 kissed? Here\u2019s everything we currently know about their relationship.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the evidence?\n\nAdmittedly, there\u2019s not a ton yet. This Wednesday, a source told \u201cPage Six\u201d that Davidson left Gerber\u2019s apartment in Soho, where paparazzi captured the comedian walking around wearing a zip-up and AirPods. Most recently, a woman captured a sneaky photo of the two eating lunch in a cozy corner booth at Sadelle\u2019s restaurant, in which Davidson is beaming at Gerber (while she stares at her iPhone. Modern love!).\n\nWhen would they have met?\n\nIt\u2019s likely the duo met this past June, when they both walked Alexander Wang\u2019s spring 2019 runway \u2014 which also happened to be Davidson\u2019s modeling debut. Who among us, at one time or another, hasn\u2019t swooned over a heavily tattooed man in a white tank top and backward baseball hat?\n\nBut didn\u2019t Davidson just get out of a relationship?\n\nCorrect. Just last week, Davidson split from his doppelg\u00e4nger, Margaret Qualley, after a few months of dating. But that\u2019s not reason enough to shut down the possibility of Davidson and Gerber being \u201ca thing.\u201d Also, Gerber seems to be just his type.\n\nHow so?\n\nDavidson loves a well-known celebrity daughter: He has dated Larry David\u2019s (Cazzie David, remember that?), Andie MacDowell\u2019s (Qualley), and now Gerber, who, as mentioned above, is Cindy Crawford\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s probably coincidental, but something to think about!", "description": "Pete Davidson and model Kaia Gerber have recently been spotted eating lunch and leaving Gerber\u2019s apartment together.
