Photo-Illustration: by Preeti Kinha; Photos: Getty, Yeardley Smith\n\nYeardley Smith is, of course, the voice of Lisa Simpson. She also hosts the true-crime podcast Small Town Dicks, which returned for its fifth season on September 13. Can she tell you about her cat, Zipper? And her other cat, Petunia?\n\nOn adopting Zipper and Petunia:\n\nSo I was separated from my second husband and I had moved out, and we had one cat left between us. And although the cat was mine first, the cat preferred my ex-husband. And I was like, okay, all right. She was kind of crazy anyway. She was a sweet cat, but she was old at that point, and crabby. And she loved him. So I was like, you know what, that\u2019s okay. You do you. And he was perfectly happy to keep her.\n\nSo I moved into this apartment and I wasn\u2019t gonna get another cat, but in the meantime, while we were in the process of getting divorced, I would still go to the house and visit the cat, Betsy, on Saturdays while my ex-husband was off playing softball. I would sometimes go to the pet store and bring her little toys that she would, of course, never play with. So one day I went to the store and they were having a small adoption event, and there were some kittens in cages. They were so cute. I saw Zipper in the cage with another little black-and-white kitty, and Zipper was all about it. Reaching through the cage like, Hey, hey, HEY! Listen to me, dude, you are not leaving without me! She was so loud and so eager. So I inquired. I told them I might be interested in taking this little gray kitten, and the woman who was running the adoption event said they didn\u2019t want to split her and this other white kitten with black patches up; it turned out to be Zipper and Petunia, my two cats. They weren\u2019t sisters, but they were rescued together. I told them I needed to think about it.\n\nSo I went away and, of course, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about them. When I went back and nobody had adopted them \u2014 they had different names at the time, I think Zipper was Tinkerbell and Petunia was Cinderella or something. And I was like, if I take you that\u2019s not gonna fly. So I thought, okay, well I certainly don\u2019t want to upset the ecosystem of these two little rescue kitties, so I decided that I would take them both.\n\nOn naming them Zipper and Petunia:\n\nI named Zipper \u201cZipper\u201d because she zipped around. She was like a windup toy. And she bounced off the walls and it was hilarious. I\u2019m sort of of the philosophy that your animal will tell you its name, and her name came immediately. And then Petunia, she\u2019s actually quite beautiful. She\u2019s white and she\u2019s very very shy. And she has a perfectly pink nose. So I named her petunia for her pink nose, because it\u2019s pink like a petunia. But then I thought to myself, well, that\u2019s sort of a stupid name. That\u2019s not a very good name. So then I tried to change the name and come up with something cooler. And I couldn\u2019t change it! I couldn\u2019t change it. So it stuck. And now she\u2019s Petunia.\n\nOn attempting to potty train, walk, and stroller her cats:\n\nSo I got them in 2008, and at the time I was living in an apartment but I was looking for a house. When we finally moved into the house, I had this idea that I would potty train them. The way you do it is, you buy this plastic form that you put on top of your toilet seat, and it has concentric circles. And as your cat gets used to it, you pop out the circles until it\u2019s just the toilet seat itself. And then the cat knows how to perch on it and the cat goes into the toilet. It\u2019s pretty cool. And it was going really well, particularly with Zipper, who was getting the hang of it. We were about on our second-to-last circle, and she was like, all right, I\u2019m good, I can do it! Petunia \u2026 not so much. Every time she would go into the bathroom she would look up and be like, Really? Are we doing this? Because, you know, I\u2019m a cat. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed but \u2026 I\u2019m a cat. And I\u2019m like, I know, but we can do this! I\u2019m not even gonna make you flush! I\u2019ll do that! She\u2019s like, Ah, this is not \u2026 I don\u2019t really like this, I\u2019m not diggin\u2019 it. This is not good for me.\n\nI realized I was losing that battle, but I was also trying to get them to walk on a leash. That was a disaster. I tried it on Zipper first, because she was always a little more game. I bought a harness for her and attached the leash and we tried it at the apartment first. I put the harness on and she was like, Ah \u2026 uh \u2026 ummm \u2026 I\u2019m not \u2026 ahh \u2026 this is \u2026 this is not good, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening here. So I attached the leash and I tried to walk her with it, and she dropped to her side, and then it was just a drag. I just dragged her along the carpet for about a foot. And she was like, See? This is not gonna work. This isn\u2019t happening.\n\nSo then I bought a cat stroller where you put the cats in the stroller and you zip it up so they can see out, and there\u2019s mesh and everything. And I thought, okay, this is gonna work. So I put them both in the stroller and we were gonna go, we were still in the apartment, we were gonna go outside, we made it out into the hallway, and they started screaming their heads off. You would think that I was pulling their whiskers out one by one with my bare hands. And literally somebody popped their head out of their apartment and was like, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine, everything\u2019s fine, I\u2019m just taking my cats for a walk!\u201d It literally sounded like bloody murder, it was so loud and so embarrassing, and they were so furious. We never made it outside.\n\nOn building the cats an elaborate cat gym that they do not use:\n\nThe staircase in my house is pretty wide, so I had this idea that I would build them this really elaborate cat gym. I hired this guy who was doing some beautiful, built-in woodwork to build it like a sculpture, so it wasn\u2019t a total eyesore when they weren\u2019t on it. And two things happened: First, when we initially built it they were kind of intrigued. It had a little tunnel with holes in it so they could hide and then peek out. It has these trays at the very top that had rugs in them so they could lay down, and then different levels that they could jump to and hop around in.\n\nSo then of course after spending a buttload of money on having this beautiful thing made, which literally looked like a Danish sculpture, after a month they were like, Meh. Got any crumpled up Post-its? \u2019Cause that\u2019s what we really like. Or a paper bag? The classic paper bag? So I was like, fuck me. So now I have this huge cat gym, which is basically the entire length of the stairway, that they don\u2019t use. So I\u2019m like, great. That\u2019s awesome.\n\nOn her favorite thing about Zipper and Petunia:\n\nZipper is just so affectionate and so trusting. I really I feel like it\u2019s a gift when your animal trusts you enough to sleep soundly on you. On your lap, or wherever it is they choose to sleep on you or with you. It is such \u2014 it is one of the deepest ways that they bond with us. And it just never gets old.\n\nAnd Petunia has her way of doing that, also. It\u2019s different than Zipper. I feel like Petunia is always on the job, she\u2019s always securing the perimeter, but I appreciate that about her. She\u2019s a sweet, sweet girl. She\u2019s lovely. And beautiful. Like, she\u2019s a white cat, and she\u2019s the cleanest white cat I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. I don\u2019t know how she does that, but \u2014 I just, I love that they seem happy. I love that. That makes me feel like we are a good little family together.", "description": "Yeardley Smith, the iconic voice of Lisa Simpson, has two cats: Petunia and Zipper.
