I find the process of getting out of the shower, drying off, slicking on cold, greasy lotion, then waiting around for it to sink in completely unbearable. What\u2019s worse than wiggling into jeans that feel glued on or sliding around in heels because your feet are still slippery? Unfortunately, due to my deep-toned dry skin and desire to stay youthful, lotion is nonnegotiable. I accepted that this was the card I\u2019d been dealt until one auspicious Christmas, when I received a game-changing gift from my aunt.\n\nMy aunt also bequeathed me my beauty obsession. Hair, nails, skin, and general pampering are her forte. My mother is not as skin-conscious as she, and I swear I\u2019ve seen my father use Dawn dish soap in his bath before. My aunt, however, is the walking version of a Sephora reviews page \u2014 she knows it all. And every year for the past ten Christmases, she\u2019s given me an epic skin-care basket filled with all of my favorites. I\u2019ve discovered some of my holy-grail products in these hauls \u2014 like Aveda\u2019s Rosemary Mint Bath Bar and Origin\u2019s Smarty Plants CC Cream \u2014 as well as new things I might not have considered trying.\n\nA couple years ago, she gifted me two bottles of Cur\u00e9l Hydra Therapy. The so-called wet-skin moisturizer claimed that it could deliver extensive, greaseless moisture \u2014 all you had to do was apply it in the shower and towel-dry after. While versions of these moisturizers have been on the market for a while, I had always been skeptical. I figured they were just as slimy feeling as the lotions I loathed, and not that fast-drying. Yet the Hydra Therapy followed through on its promises \u2014 my skin was so gleaming I looked like a glazed doughnut (without being as sticky as one). This formula, along with a few others, is now in my regular, everyday rotation, but that hasn\u2019t stopped me from eyeing more I want to try. Read on for all the wet-skin moisturizers I use, and the ones I plan to add to my growing collection.\n\nWet-Skin Moisturizers I Can\u2019t Stop Buying\n\nCur\u00e9l Hydra Therapy Wet Skin Moisturizer This is the one that kicked it off. My aunt who gave it to me must have noticed that I was starting to develop reptilian scales. Curel\u2019s formula is water-activated, so it is best used right at the end of a shower, before the drying process, when your skin is really wet and your pores are open. I keep mine in the shower and slather it on after I shut the water off but before I towel off. I rub it in just like I would an ordinary lotion, and then (and only then) do I towel-dry. And voil\u00e0 \u2014 baby-soft skin. It\u2019s filled with ceramides to lock in hydration and restore the skin barrier. Best of all, it\u2019s quick drying and non-greasy. There is even an anti-itch formula that delivers even more intense moisture \u2014 perfect for the winter or for those with eczema. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nJergens Wet Skin Moisturizer With Enriching Shea Oil Hydra Therapy is unscented and comes in only two formulations. So when it comes to versatility, Jergens takes the cake, with a whopping four variations of its wet-skin moisturizer. You can choose from formulas enriched with shea butter/oil, almond oil, argan oil, or coconut oil. In my opinion, the coconut version smells the best, but the shea butter/oil formula just cannot be beat. Its skin-softening properties are seriously shocking. Plus, since it doesn\u2019t have a pump (like Hydra Therapy), it\u2019s easy to travel with \u2014 hotel showers can be so drying. $6 at Amazon Buy $6 at Amazon Buy\n\nLush Ro's Argan Body Conditioner Rich is the word that comes to mind when I think of this stuff. Ro\u2019s is loaded with almond oil, shea butter, cupua\u00e7u butter, fair-trade cocoa butter, argan oil, and vitamins \u2014 so it feels lavish when it goes on the skin. And a little goes a long way \u2014 a good thing given its steeper price point. Unlike Cur\u00e9l and Jergens, you actually rinse Ro\u2019s off (like a hair conditioner). The best part: Ro\u2019s is vegan, cruelty-free, ethically sourced, and comes in a 100 percent recycled package (which you can return to the store to be recycled again). $36 at Lush Buy\n\nLush Buffy Body Butter Another Lush favorite, Buffy is basically just a hard bar of shea and cocoa butters mixed with ground almonds, rice, and aduki beans to slough away dead skin cells. It is the only wet-skin moisturizer I\u2019ve used that has exfoliating properties. I usually run it under the shower stream to get it wet, rub it into my skin with slight pressure, then rinse it off. Afterward, dry skin? I don\u2019t know her [Mariah Carey voice]. $13 at Lush Buy\n\nWet-Skin Moisturizers I\u2019d Like to Try\n\nSheaMoisture African Black Soap Body Conditioner When I was growing up, African Black Soap was a staple in my family\u2019s Nigerian household. African Black Soap is known to allegedly help with various skin conditions, like hyperpigmentation, acne, and stretch marks. It deeply cleanses, clarifies, exfoliates, moisturizes \u2014 hell, it may even pay your rent. Needless to say, I am extremely curious to see the ingredient in action within a wet-skin moisturizer, especially from a brown-girl-friendly brand like SheaMoisture. $11 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nNivea Cocoa Butter In-Shower Body Lotion I am clearly a fan of products that contain shea and/or cocoa butters, which I love for their distinct, bakery-esque smell. Though many of the aforementioned wet-skin conditioners contain cocoa butter, I\u2019ve yet to come across one that replicated its heavenly scent. Additionally, coming from a classic brand like Nivea \u2014 an institution in hydration for over a century \u2014 this has to be good. $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nEucerin In-Shower Body Lotion When I was 22, I got my first (and only) tattoo. After it was finished, the tattoo artist gave me an after-care sheet with three simple instructions: 1) Keep the tattoo dry; 2) Keep the tattoo clean; 3) Keep the tattoo lubricated. He specifically recommended Eucerin\u2019s Aquaphor Healing Ointment for rule No. 3. It was so hydrating that it quickly became my go-to moisturizer for tough skin like heels and elbows. Could their In-Shower Moisturizer be my new standby? $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nL'Occitane Cleansing & Softening Almond Shower Oil The French company is most known for its cult-classic shea butter hand cream. I have two tubes in my nightstand drawer and keep mini-tubes in my backpack, suitcase, car, and purse. To quote Frank\u2019s RedHot commercial star Jean Hamilton, \u201cI put that shit on everything.\u201d While L\u2019Occitane\u2019s shower oil is advertised as a body cleanser, one Sephora reviewer said that she uses it as she would a wet-skin moisturizer and that it works just as well. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
