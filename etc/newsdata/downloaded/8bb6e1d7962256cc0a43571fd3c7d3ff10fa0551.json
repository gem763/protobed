Mott Children's Hospital in Michigan from performing a second brain scan.\n\nThe legal struggle culminated when a circuit court judge lifted the stay in place Tuesday saying he did not have jurisdiction as the paperwork need to be filed in a state court.\n\nThe hospital added in a statement obtained by the DailyMail.com, 'Further testing \u2014 including an electroencephalogram (EEG) and a cerebral blood flow study \u2014 detected no electrical activity and no blood flow to Bobby\u2019s brain.'\n\nThe sad saga of 14-year-old Bobby Reyes ended Tuesday when the hospital, by state law, removed the brain dead teenager from life support\n\nHappier times for a 14-year-old Michigan boy who died after a severe asthma attack left him brain dead\n\n'By law in Michigan, an individual is dead who has sustained either irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions or irreversible cessation of all function of the entire brain, including the brain stem,' the statement said.\n\nThe hospital also wrote that to continue medical interventions was 'inappropriate' after Reyes was officially declared brain dead and it 'violates the professional integrity of Michigan Medicine's clinicians.'\n\nThe family of Bobby Reyes holds a bedside vigil after a judge ruled a second brain test can be performed, which confirmed he was brain dead\n\nThe family of Bobby Reyes didn't get help from the courts or the hospital to save the brain dead boy\n\nAccording to the hospital, his caregivers worked hard with the family to arrange for a transfer to another facility. However. all of the facilities, more than 20, refused to extend his care.\n\n\u201cIt was so quick,\u201d Reyes' mother Sarah Jones told WXYZ.\n\nLate last month the boy experienced a bad asthma attack that even his inhaler couldn't help.\n\nBy the time she called 9-1-1, Reyes stopped breathing, despite never having a serious asthma episode.\n\nHe was airlifted to the hospital and doctors determined he was brain dead. A first test was done Sept. 24. But state law requires a second test to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n'Our team at Michigan Medicine sympathizes with the Reyes family and is committed to providing support in this difficult time.'", "description": "Michigan teenager suffered a severe asthma attack leaving him brain dead.
