REUTERS/Mike Theiler\n\n\u201cIf there were clarity in that outlook it would help the growth environment quite a bit,\u201d Malpass told reporters during the IMF and World Bank fall meetings after the EU and Britain, the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, announced a tentative deal.\n\nAfter several days of negotiations, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday said that Britain and the EU had agreed a \u201cgreat\u201d new Brexit deal, but it must still be approved by the British parliament.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he would recommend the EU\u2019s speedy approval of the agreement.\n\nMalpass said Brexit uncertainty had been weighing on trade and the economic outlook for both Britain and the EU. Resolving the issue would have benefits for those economies and the developing world, he said.\n\nKristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, called the agreement \u201cgood news,\u201d and said she hoped the will to complete the deal \u201cholds in all quarters.\u201d\n\nShe told reporters the IMF had estimated that Britain\u2019s gross domestic product would grow by 3.5% to 5% less if it exited the EU without a deal, while such a move would shave 0.5% off the GDP of the EU.\n\nEven with a deal, Britain\u2019s GDP stands to drop by 2%, Georgieva said, although she noted that much of that impact had already been absorbed given the long period since Britain\u2019s vote to leave the bloc in 2016.\n\nThe IMF downgraded its forecast for economic growth in Britain this year to 1.2% from the 1.5% it forecast three months ago, which would be the weakest since 2009.\n\nBefore the agreement was reached, the IMF this week forecast that Britain\u2019s GDP would grow by 1.2% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020, after growth of 1.4% in 2018.", "description": "World Bank President David Malpass said on Thursday that clarity over Britain's exit from the European Union would strengthen the outlook for global growth, aiding both rich nations and the developing world.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441958569&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1RI", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
