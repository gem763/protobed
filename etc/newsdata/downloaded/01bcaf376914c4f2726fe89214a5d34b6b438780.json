We don\u2019t understand how such dangerous people are allowed to continue with their lives after such evil deeds,\u201d Hlophe said.\n\nLocal community leader Mfana Zwane said the incident had angered the entire community.\n\n\u201cMost of the people around here are farm workers and this incident shows them how employers around here don\u2019t value the lives of black people.\n\n\u201cAs the community we strongly believe that police are trying to cover up the matter.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that one of the victims is still alive and knows the attackers, police are yet to act.\n\n\u201cWhen we took up the matter with the police one of the policemen even lied to us and said we don\u2019t have to worry as the suspects have already been arrested. We are not even sure whether they even bothered to register the case,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile police confirmed that the matter was being investigated, they denied claims about a cover-up.\n\nThe Association for Rural Advancement (Afra) said the Vryheid assault highlighted the fact that farm workers remained vulnerable to abuse despite legislation meant to protect them.\n\n\u201cThe problem that we see as Afra is that government is not doing enough to educate both farm owners and the workers about the law,\u201d said Afra spokesperson Nokuthula Mthimunye.\n\nStatistics show that attacks on farms have increased by 60% since 2010. According to the Transvaalse Landbou-unie (TLU) farm attacks have jumped from 1 400 between 2000 and 2009 to 2 616 between 2010 and 2019.", "description": "The relatives of two farm workers who were brutally beaten by their employers at a farm in Vryheid are seething with anger after police have \u201crefused\u201d to arrest the suspects.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9189/8568608231a545cab50cfc70d030424b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-02"}
