He has committed an impeachable abuse of power in demanding that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky investigate the family of Democratic political rival Joe Biden, and it looks like he tied that request to the release of military aid already authorized by Congress. All day Wednesday, Republicans clung to the talking point that there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d\u2014even though immediately after Zelensky mentioned needing new defense support from the United States, Trump asked him for the \u201cfavor\u201d of investigating Biden (having earlier complained that the support his administration has provided to Ukraine was not \u201creciprocal,\u201d which is English for \u201cquid pro quo\u201d). Ad Policy\n\nOn Thursday morning, the initial whistle-blower complaint about Trump\u2019s pressure on Zelensky was released. It confirmed everything previously reported, and added the detail that White House officials were ordered to \u201clock down\u201d\u2014translation: \u201chide\u201d\u2014all records of the conversations. (It also reveals \u201cthis was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this administration that a presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive\u2026information.\u201d) It describes how administration officials traveled to Kyiv to help locals \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s directives to the new president after the July call.\n\nSo many Trump factotums have been implicated here, even before the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint was released. His deeply creepy personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who is all over the newly released document, says Mike Pompeo\u2019s State Department sent him to talk to Ukrainian leaders about investigating Biden. Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney apparently held back the Ukrainian aid. And Attorney General William Barr\u2019s fingerprints are all over this mess\u2014not only did Trump press Zelensky to work with Barr, at least four times in one phone call; Barr\u2019s Justice Department rejected the Inspector General\u2019s recommendation to investigate a whistle-blower\u2019s report about the president\u2019s demands of Zelensky. Now that the New York Times has reported that Trump first asked Zelensky to investigate \u201ccorruption\u201d after his April election, Barr\u2019s tongue-tied response to Senator Kamala Harris\u2019s May 1 question\u2014\u201cHas the president or anyone at the White House ever asked you to open an investigation of anyone?\u201d\u2014looks increasingly dodgy.\n\nRemarkably, but not unbelievably, most Republicans continue to defend Trump. Sad former maverick Senator Lindsey Graham rushed out after the transcript of the July Trump-Zelensky call was released to insist: \u201cTo impeach any president over a phone call like this would be insane.\u201d House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, infamous for telling a group of GOP friends he thinks \u201c[Vladimir] Putin pays [Trump],\u201d introduced a resolution he sloppily described on Twitter: \u201cThe House of Reps disapproves of the actions of Speaker Pelosi to initiate an impeachment inquiry against the duly elected President of the US.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell called it \u201claughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense.\u201d Related Article The Case for Keeping Impeachment Clean and Simple Jeet Heer\n\nThere have been a few signs of fracture. Human weathervane Mitt Romney, now the senator from Utah, called the transcript \u201cextremely troubling,\u201d but stopped short of saying what that meant. Wednesday night, patriot poseur Senator Ben Sasse insisted that \u201cRepublicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons to say there\u2019s no there there when there\u2019s obviously lots that\u2019s very troubling there.\u201d \u201cTroubling\u201d is emerging as the safe word for Republicans, though, to be fair, Senator Pat Toomey also called the president\u2019s behavior \u201cinappropriate.\u201d I\u2019m waiting for Maine Senator Susan Collins to find it \u201cdisappointing,\u201d her trademark, but she hasn\u2019t yet.\n\nStill, on a morning when the whistle-blower complaint has been released and acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has just begun to testify, should we stand by for more defections? Democrats who read the whistle-blower report Wednesday evening emerged from the room visibly disturbed as they walked past cable TV cameras. Representative Jackie Speier described it as \u201cnothing short of explosive,\u201d adding, \u201cI was stunned.\u201d\n\nSo I have to assume we\u2019ll see more GOP equivocation. But don\u2019t expect a wholesale collapse. This is Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party. In 2012, with his anti-Obama birther racism as a political calling card, he made Mitt Romney grovel for his presidential endorsement; in 2016, he humiliated all of his rivals for the nomination. And look at what he\u2019s done to everyone who\u2019s served him: Former attorney general Jeff Sessions, who once held a safe Alabama Senate seat, resigned in shame. Military leaders like Jim Mattis, H.R. McMaster, and John Kelly had to slink away. This scandal alone, as I noted above, implicates Pompeo, Mulvaney, and Barr (as well as former \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d Giuliani, but he disgraced himself long ago). All were formerly, in their own ways, pillars of the modern GOP. Current Issue View our current issue\n\nAnd notice what Trump did in his otherwise incoherent Wednesday press conference: Quite coherently, he implicated his vice president, Mike Pence, in the Ukraine mess. \u201cI think you should ask for VP Pence\u2019s conversation because he had a couple of conversations also.\u201d Ouch. Message to Republicans: Don\u2019t think impeachment gets you out of this. The whistle-blower\u2019s complaint also reveals that Trump told Pence to cancel a trip to Zelensky\u2019s inauguration. Trump is right about one thing: Pence is complicit in his corruption here.\n\nI\u2019ve often observed that Trump talks and acts like a Mafia boss. After reading the transcript of Trump\u2019s July call with Zelensky, House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff called it \u201ca classic Mafia-style shakedown.\u201d But that\u2019s also Trump\u2019s approach to his own party. I\u2019ve always welcomed Never Trumpers to the resistance; we need them to revive democracy, so we can go back to arguing about tax rates and the virtues of single-payer health care. But the Vichy GOP is a different story. I mean, I\u2019d welcome them too\u2014but I don\u2019t expect them. They are afraid, of Trump as well as his voters. They will not leave him easily, because he won\u2019t let them.\n\nI have never been more anxious to be proven wrong.", "description": "The president has so thoroughly annexed the GOP that it\u2019s going to be hard for its leaders to cut their losses\u2014even as he flails.", "authors": ["Joan Walsh", "Jeet Heer", "Dave Zirin", "Rukia Lumumba", "Makani Themba", "William D.
