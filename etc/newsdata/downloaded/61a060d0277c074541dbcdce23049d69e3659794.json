Here\u2019s what Visa is doing to protect your business.", "language": "en", "text": "Someone walks up to an ATM and punches in a request for a $5,000 withdrawal. Even though there's only $50 in the account, the ATM immediately spits out a mountain of crisp $20 bills.\n\nHow does this happen?\n\nBlame the \"Man in the Middle,\" one of the latest and more clever criminal methods affecting financial institutions today. Penny Lane, head of Visa's Payment Fraud Disruption program, explained how \"Man in the Middle\" attacks are pulled off to attendees at Visa's recent Security Summit in San Francisco.\n\nIn the past, criminal gangs would typically steal from ATMs by sending a team \u2014 known as \"cash-out crews\" \u2014 to several bank branches at once. They'd use stolen debit cards and PINs to grab funds.\n\nIn the new attacks, criminals gain access to the banking system and install software that intercepts communications between the ATM and the bank's \"payment switch.\" This is the mechanism that approves or denies transactions.\n\n\"Once the criminal's software is in place,\" Lane says, \"they take over control of the bank's network and can approve anything they want.\"\n\nCriminals no longer need stolen debit cards. They don't need legitimate PINs. They also don't leave a log record, which makes the crime more difficult to investigate.\n\nA new era of attacks\n\nLike many developments in financial fraud, these ATM cashout attacks \u2014 referred to as FASTCash \u2014 were the invention of Lazarus, a cybercrime group linked to the North Korean government.\n\nNation states have long tried to steal secrets from other governments. Over the past 18 months, Lazarus has ushered in an era where nation states use their military-grade cyber expertise for financial gain.\n\nFor example, Lane says Lazarus was also behind new financially-motivated phishing schemes \u2014 attempts to gather a person's passwords or other sensitive information.\n\nBy now, most employees have been trained to be wary of suspicious-looking email and not click on attachments. But Lazarus is not using obvious phishing techniques. In one case, the Lazarus group identified a bank employee whose credentials they wanted to steal and specifically targeted the employee with a robust social-engineering strategy.\n\nThey posed as headhunters and even arranged to conduct a Skype interview with him. This elaborate ploy put him at such ease that the employee filled out an application form called \"application.pdf.exe,\" which normally he would have noticed as a software program.\n\n\"The bank employee filled out the form on his home computer, but the criminals wanted to infiltrate his work network,\" Lane says. \"So they called him at work the next day and told him his file had been corrupted and he needed to fill out a new form immediately. He did.\"\n\nLane's presentation also featured a 2019 incident that may signal another type of attack. A bank had a power outage and \"failed over,\" or switched, to a secondary data center. The backup center did not have the same stringent security as the primary data center.\n\nWithin 30 minutes, the bank experienced ATM and point-of-sale fraud. It's unclear whether criminals caused the power failure or were monitoring the bank so closely that they could leap on an opportunity. \"I don't believe in coincidences,\" Lane says.\n\nBetter defense against new threats\n\nMargaret Reid at the Visa Security Summit Visa Margaret Reid, a senior vice president at Visa, says it's important for everyone to understand the newest threats and the best ways to combat them.\n\nThis includes straightforward procedures like making sure someone at a company is available to answer phone calls from Visa while they are dealing with an intrusion. Criminals count on companies overlooking such basics in the scramble to address an attack.\n\nVisa also released a number of new capabilities, like technology that determines if an e-commerce site has been affected with malware that steals payment information after a visitor makes a purchase.\n\n\"We're in the middle of all this, and we see so much more than any individual endpoint,\" Reid says. \"We're not just sitting back, but we're looking for ways to mitigate the worst of the attacks and even prevent them.\"\n\nFind out more about how Visa can protect your business from cybercriminals.\n\nThis post was created by Insider Studios with Visa.", "description": "Cybercriminals have upped the ante on their attacks on companies' financial functions, but Visa has developed new security measures to protect them.", "authors": ["Sponsor Post", "Created Insider Studios With Visa"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88fa602e22af18c82cfc45-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
