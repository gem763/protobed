We have hundreds of people registered and we know we're likely to expect more people today,\" said Jason Small.\n\nBy 2:30 p.m. the Red Cross said it had registered more than 3,300 evacuees from 14 First Nations, but many are staying with friends and family or in hotels.\n\nThe second emergency shelter will be opened if necessary because of the potential for more evacuees, the Red Cross said.\n\nVolunteers from the Red Cross set up cots for evacuees to sleep on at the RBC Convention Centre. People from 11 Manitoba First Nations have been approved by the federal government to receive assistance.

It's going to take a huge, huge, huge effort on our part.\"\n\nA Manitoba Hydro worker fixes lines damaged by the storm that ripped through the southern part of the province. (Submitted by Manitoba Hydro)\n\nThat means some customers won't have power for more than a week.\n\n\"We've got significant damage. We do have crews from SaskPower, Minnesota Power and Hydro One [from Ontario] helping us to tackle what we've got ahead of us over the next seven to 10 days,\" Owen said.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. CT, more than 21,000 customers remained without power across the province. In Winnipeg, Owen said that number is scaling back, with just 900 customers still in the dark.\n\nToday we address areas hardest hit by the storm. In Winnipeg, it could take long as 4 days for restoration; for the rest of the province, it may be 7-10 days.<br><br>If it's safe for you to travel - please stay with a friend or family member, or contact your RM about set up shelters. <a href=\"https://t.co/dTrA82kGpx\">pic.twitter.com/dTrA82kGpx</a> \u2014@manitobahydro\n\nAt its height, the entire city of Portage la Prairie, Man., was without power. As of last night, crews were able to restore much of it.\n\nPortage la Prairie resident Heather Greenlay was shocked when she surveyed the damage.\n\n\"It looks like a tornado went though almost every area of Portage. Trees twisted up, building facades twisted off and roofs peeled back and whatnot,\" she said.\n\nIrvine Ferris, the mayor of Portage la Prairie, doesn't have power himself, and it's been a challenging few days.\n\nManitoba Hydro tweeted this photo of a downed power line in rural Manitoba on Saturday night as the public utility worked to restore power to thousands of customers.

The municipality opened a reception centre to host people who couldn't find hotel rooms. He said 80 people stayed there.\n\n\"It's been kind of a crazy 48 hours, but at the same time we've seen kind of the best in people,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Ferris doesn't have power, he does have a propane barbecue, which allowed him to enjoy a Thanksgiving meal with his family.\n\n\"We've had some turkey sandwiches. It's pretty good,\" he said.\n\nManitoba Hydro says the biggest remaining outages are in the Interlake area, as well as in Dauphin and Neepawa, northwest of Winnipeg.\n\nDamage from downed trees and power lines posed hazards in Portage la Prairie.

The heavy precipitation fell on trees still laden with leaves, damaging transmission lines and towers.\n\nThe Red River Floodway was activated on Oct. 9 -- the first time it's ever been used in the fall.

The Red Cross has been authorized by the federal government to support evacuations for 16 First Nations.\n\nJerry Daniels, grand chief of the Southern Chiefs Organization, told CBC News on Monday that thousands of people are affected.\n\n\"People are just looking for warmth and something to eat. The necessities are what people are worried about,\" he said.\n\nHe's worried about overcrowding in emergency shelters, especially for the vulnerable.\n\n\"We're hoping to keep our elders and those who are sick in much more comfortable situations,\" he said, including in local hotels.", "description": "Hundreds of people are seeking shelter in Winnipeg after being evacuated from First Nations communities as Manitoba reels from a snowstorm that has left tens of thousands without power at a time, and forced the province and city to declare states of emergency.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320422.1571062042!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mb-hydro.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
