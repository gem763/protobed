The public has a way of deciding for itself, and often at the last minute. \u201cJoker\u201d held better than expected, dropping 43% to $55 million. Most prognoses suggested $48 million or below (our guess was $50 million).\n\nThen, consensus held that \u201cGemini Man\u201d and \u201cThe Addams Family\u201d would vie closely for second place. Instead, the animated reboot of comic-TV show-film franchise scored an easy victory over Ang Lee\u2019s $135 million action film; even star Will Smith couldn\u2019t prevent the disastrous initial numbers.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nIt\u2019s a quasi-holiday weekend with Columbus Day, which will likely to boost numbers Sunday and Monday. At $138 million, that\u2019s about $40 million less than the 2018 holiday weekend, which took place a week earlier.\n\nYear to date still shows the box office down about $525 million compared to 2018, over 5.5%, and it\u2019s highly unlikely to make up that difference.\n\nNot that it matters for Todd Phillips\u2019 backstory of D.C. Comics\u2019 most charismatic character. After its $96 million opening set an October record, its impressive 43% drop is on par with two superhero movies that became word-of-mouth favorites after strong openings: \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d\n\nThat success was foretold by strong weekday numbers. Concerns about safety issues appear to have been for naught, and controversy often helps a film as long as there is strong favorable response mixed in with the naysayers. Worldwide, it\u2019s now at $544 million for a film that cost a thrifty $65 million. It could approach $1 billion.\n\n\u201cHotel Transylvania\u201d paved the way for pre-Halloween animated films, although \u201cThe Addams Family\u201d didn\u2019t quite reach that level. Its opening was strong, but not close to the 1991 live-action film that opened to (adjusted) $52 million and ultimately $243 million domestic. Still, this return is a real boost for the revived United Artists (a combine that includes Annapurna, MGM, UA, and Orion titles). And it has the rest of the month to thrive.\n\nComing off of \u201cAladdin,\u201d Will Smith\u2019s failed venture into Denzel Washington-style action genre movies won\u2019t hurt him much. For Ang Lee, however, he\u2019s now floundered twice after a career high with \u201cThe Life of Pi.\u201d His 2016 \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk\u201d failed to gross even $2 million in North America, but it could be brushed off. A $20 million opening for the costly \u201cGemini Man,\u201d which likely tops out at $50 million domestic, is awful.\n\nEven if it gets to $200 million worldwide, Paramount and its partners are looking at a major loss. What had been projected to gross around $30 million came in a third lower. Yes, reviews were awful, but this wasn\u2019t aimed at a critic-influenced audience. The pull of \u201cJoker\u201d might have hurt but whatever caused it, the result is bad.\n\n\u201cJexi\u201d was far worse, as expected. The Adam Devine comedy took in a bit over $3 million in a low-key release that went nowhere. It\u2019s a sad end to an otherwise strong run by CBS Films, which going forward will provide content for CBS All Access.\n\nThree films with strong female appeal all held quite well. \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d placed highest at #5, down 39%. It should reach $100 million. \u201cHustlers\u201d will be there in a few days. It dropped 40% and placed sixth. \u201cJudy\u201d dropped only 29% in its third weekend, for seventh place.\n\n\u201cAbominable\u201d was fourth, down 48% and hurt by \u201cAddams Family.\u201d Although still viable, it will need foreign help, particularly in China, to get by.\n\nNot in the Top Ten, but in 13th place is \u201cParasite,\u201d the South Korean film that platformed in only three theaters for an incredible $376,000.
