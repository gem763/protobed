Warren)\n\nThe games played out similarly, with two tough defenses, lots of turnovers and not much offense to speak of.\n\nIn his second start for Washington, quarterback Jacob Eason \u2014 the highly touted transfer from Georgia \u2014 struggled, albeit against a quality Cal defense. He finished a pedestrian 18-of-30 for 162 yards, zero touchdowns and one interception.\n\nEason and the offense continually stalled near the end zone and had to settle for four field goals. The final one was a go-ahead 49-yard kick by Peyton Henry with just over two minutes to play.\n\nAt that point, it appeared the Huskies were going to escape with an ugly 19-17 win, but the Bears answered by quickly driving it all the way down near the goal line to set up Thomas\u2019 clincher with 8 seconds on the clock.\n\nThe game kicked off at 7:30 p.m. but was halted just a few minutes in when the flashes lit up the Seattle sky.\n\nStory continues\n\nOk, here\u2019s the moment the power went out at Husky Stadium: pic.twitter.com/bnuqgoUalg \u2014 Nick Patterson (@NickHPatterson) September 8, 2019\n\nThe stands were completely cleared and at one point the power even went out at Husky Stadium.\n\nPlay finally resumed after a 2 hour, 38 minute delay.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "For the second straight season, California stunned a ranked Washington team.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hILJCYXILEb5pNFyjy54vA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YzTcz1hoUSBxYo22NUMSQg--~B/aD0yMTU1O3c9MzIzMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/629dda60-d211-11e9-b457-2295db605ba1", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
