The U.S. Embassy issued a statement saying immunity is \u201crarely waived.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prime minister urged the president to reconsider the U.S. position so the individual involved can return to the U.K., cooperate with police and allow Harry\u2019s family to receive justice,\u201d Johnson\u2019s office said in an emailed statement about the call. \u201cThe president said he was fully aware of the case and deeply saddened by what has happened, and he expressed his condolences to Harry\u2019s parents. The leaders agreed to work together to find a way forward as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe nature of the call illustrates the balance the British leader is trying to strike. As the the U.K. prepares to leave the European Union, Johnson is eager to burnish ties -- both diplomatic and trade -- with the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nBut at the same time, with a possible general election looming, he\u2019s trying to avoid being seen as being in the pocket of the U.S. -- an image opposition Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn is keen to propagate.\n\nBy broaching the subject of Dunn with Trump, Johnson was following through on a pledge made earlier in the week to raise it \u201cpersonally with the White House.\u201d\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab also issued a statement on the case, saying: \u201cWe will use every avenue and opportunity open to us to try to right the wrong and allow the justice system to follow its natural course.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Thomas Penny, John Harney\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson, eager to cultivate closer relations with President Donald Trump as he pursues Brexit, nevertheless used a phone call between the two leaders to raise the thorny issues of tariffs and the case of an American diplomat\u2019s wife who left the U.K. following a fatal", "authors": ["Alex Morales"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
