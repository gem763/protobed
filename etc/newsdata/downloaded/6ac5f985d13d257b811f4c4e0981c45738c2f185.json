In March this year, Microsoft rolled Tamper Protection for more tests to Microsoft Defender ATP versions.\n\nStarting today, the feature will be available for all Microsoft Defender users. Microsoft told ZDNet in a phone call last week that the feature will be enabled by default for all users in the coming weeks, in a multi-stage rollout.\n\nIf users don't want to wait, Microsoft said they can also enable Tamper Protection right now.\n\nA new option has been added to the Windows Security options page to control Tamper Protection's state. To enable or disable Tamper Protection, the steps are:\n\nClick Start, and start typing Defender. In the search results, select Windows Security. Select Virus & threat protection > Virus & threat protection settings. Set Tamper Protection to On or Off.\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\nBut Microsoft emphasizes that Tamper Protection was specifically built for enterprise environments, where the protection level it provides is far superior to what a home user gets.\n\nHere, when a system administrator enables the feature for a company's workstations, Tamper Protection locks out malware and end-users alike. Once enabled, only administrators will be able to change Defender settings across a company's computers.\n\nThe only catch is that administrators must use Microsoft Intune to manage their workstation fleet.\n\n\"When an administrator enables the policy in Microsoft Intune, the tamper protection policy is digitally signed in the backend before it's sent to endpoints,\" Microsoft says.\n\n\"The endpoint verifies the validity and intent, establishing that it is a signed package that only security operations personnel with Microsoft Intune admin rights can control.\"\n\nImage: Microsoft\n\nIn enterprise setups, when malware or users try to modify Defender features, an alert is raised in Microsoft Defender ATP's Security\n\nCenter, which administrators can investigate further.\n\nTamper Protection is only available for Windows 10 1903 May release or later. Microsoft said it will work to port the feature to older versions.", "description": "Tamper Protection prevents malware from disabling Windows Defender features.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/13/ef103e64-4558-433d-98b1-120e31f6b1b5/thumbnail/770x578/bb9fcedfb291dd75f7b27734ee59d0d5/top-windows-defender-expert-these-are-th-5d4d935d79f16e0001f923da-1-aug-13-2019-19-14-00-poster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
