The collection includes games from the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4, but not the original PlayStation. The four new games are some of the most popular titles on PlayStation 4, but they'll only be available until January 2020.\n\nThe lowered price matches Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service that offers a similar library for Xbox-owners, but without the streaming option. Google will launch its own game streaming service, Stadia, for $10 per month in November, but games must be purchased separately.\n\nRead more: Microsoft and Sony's surprise game streaming alliance is a shocker, and it raises an uncomfortable truth about the cloud wars\n\nSony first launched PlayStation Now in July 2014, but the service has seen major changes over the last five years. It was originally designed to work on smart TVs and PlayStation 3, as well as the now-discontinued PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV platforms. These days the service is exclusive to the PlayStation 4 and PC; PlayStation 4 users have the option to download PS4 games directly from the collection instead of streaming.\n\nPlayStation Now is available in 19 countries. In May Sony agreed to partner with Microsoft to develop new cloud gaming technology to make video game streaming even easier in the future.", "description": "Sony is doubling down on PlayStation Now, cutting the price to $10 per month and adding some of the most popular games on PlayStation 4.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9399a02e22af63a160bf3d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
