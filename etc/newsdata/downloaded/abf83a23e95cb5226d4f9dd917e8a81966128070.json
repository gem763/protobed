The authors of a 2017 study which found that reading science fiction \u201cmakes you stupid\u201d have conducted a follow-up that found that it\u2019s only bad sci-fi that has this effect: a well-written slice of sci-fi will be read just as thoroughly as a literary story.\n\nTwo years ago, Washington and Lee University professors Chris Gavaler and Dan Johnson published a paper in which they revealed that when readers were given a sci-fi story peopled by aliens and androids and set on a space ship, as opposed to a similar one set in reality, \u201cthe science fiction setting triggered poorer overall reading\u201d and appeared to \u201cpredispose readers to a less effortful and comprehending mode of reading \u2013 or what we might term non-literary reading\u201d.\n\nScience fiction triggers 'poorer reading', study finds Read more\n\nBut after critics suggested that merely changing elements of a mainstream story into sci-fi tropes did not make for a quality story, Gavaler and Johnson decided to revisit the research. This time, 204 participants were given one of two stories to read: both were called \u201cAda\u201d and were identical apart from one word, to provide the strictest possible control. The \u201cliterary\u201d version begins: \u201cMy daughter is standing behind the bar, polishing a wine glass against a white cloth.\u201d The science-fiction variant begins: \u201cMy robot is standing behind the bar, polishing a wine glass against a white cloth.\u201d\n\nIn what Gavaler and Johnson call \u201ca significant departure\u201d from their previous study, readers of both texts scored the same in comprehension, \u201cboth accumulatively and when divided into the comprehension subcategories of mind, world, and plot\u201d.\n\nThe presence of the word \u201crobot\u201d did not reduce merit evaluation, effort reporting, or objective comprehension scores, they write; in their previous study, these had been reduced by the sci-fi setting. \u201cThis difference between studies is presumably a result of differences between our two science-fiction texts,\u201d they say.\n\nGavaler said he was \u201cpretty startled\u201d by the result.\n\n\u201cIt turns out our first study didn\u2019t reveal much about sci-fi generally but about what we would now have to call \u2018non-literary sci-fi\u2019. The text we used for our new study is instead \u2018literary sci-fi\u2019, and it didn\u2019t trigger poor reading at all. Not even when it was introduced with a paragraph describing the story as non-literary. Readers basically ignored that intro and engaged actively with the text itself anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cI assume there were plenty of readers in the sample groups who don\u2019t like sci-fi, but it didn\u2019t matter because they still responded to the literary qualities of the story. Their comprehension didn\u2019t drop this time.\u201d\n\nThe paper, titled The Literary Genre Effect, is due to be published later this year in the journal Scientific Study of Literature.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that it will once-and-for-all give definitive evidence that literary fiction and genre fiction, specifically science fiction, are not separate categories,\u201d said Gavaler.", "description": "After finding readers devoted less attention to science fiction than literary fiction, researchers say quality determines comprehension \u2013 not genre", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de02b8fa42952c932e964118d9fe4db701eedd33/248_0_1999_1200/master/1999.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=412e49bb2a38d7cf1b7f866d711b26d6", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
