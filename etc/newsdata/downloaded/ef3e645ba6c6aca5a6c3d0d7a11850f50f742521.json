He added that the withdrawal had already begun.\n\n\u201cOnce that is completed, Turkey has agreed to a permanent cease-fire and the United States of America will work with Turkey, will work with nations around the world, to ensure that peace and stability is the order of the day.\u201d\n\nFollowing the press conference, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu pressed that the U.S.-Turkey agreement was \u201cnot a ceasefire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will pause the operation for 120 hours in order for the terrorists to leave. We will only stop the operation if our conditions are met,\u201d Cavusoglu said in a separate news conference.\n\nThe administration, however, is lauding the deal as a victory.\n\nPence praised the \u201cstrong leadership that President Trump provided to this moment and the cooperation with President Erdo\u011fan and Turkey.\u201d\n\nFollowing the announcement, Trump tweeted that the deal \u201ccould NEVER have been made 3 days ago. There needed to be some \u2018tough\u2019 love in order to get it done. Great for everybody. Proud of all!\u201d\n\nHe later added: \u201cThis is a great day for civilization. I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path. People have been trying to make this \u201cDeal\u201d for many years. Millions of lives will be saved. Congratulations to ALL!\u201d\n\nTrump also told reporters that he wanted to \"thank and congratulate President Erdo\u011fan,\" calling the Turkish leader \"a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have a problem because frankly he\u2019s a hell of a leader, and he\u2019s a tough man,\" Trump told reporters in Texas. \"He\u2019s a strong man, and he did the right thing and I really appreciate it, and I will appreciate it in the future.\"\n\nPence said that the United States will \u201ccontinue to engage\u201d in Syria but added, \u201cnot militarily.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President made it clear that we're not going to have military personnel on the ground, but the United States will continue to engage diplomatically, politically and, of course, in humanitarian aid and support to affect all of the people affected in this region,\u201d Pence said.\n\nPompeo, who spoke alongside Pence, said there \u201cremains a great deal of work to do in the region ... [but] President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s decision tonight to work alongside President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP congressman slams Trump over report that U.S. bombed former anti-ISIS coalition headquarters US to restore 'targeted assistance' to Central American countries after migration deal Trump says lawmakers should censure Schiff MORE to achieve this end will be one that I think will benefit Turkey a great deal.\u201d\n\nAsked how Washington will repair the U.S-Turkey relationship going forward, Pence said the United States will not impose any further sanctions on Turkey and once a permanent cease-fire is in effect, Trump has agreed to withdraw the most recent economic sanctions imposed on Ankara this past Monday.\n\nQuestions still remain on whether such a cease-fire agreement will be held up on Turkey\u2019s end after Washington and Ankara earlier this year made a deal for a \u201cSecurity Mechanism,\u201d which Turkey broke.\n\nIn that agreement, the United States had the Kurdish fighters demolish their defensive positions and fortifications and pull back from the border, which they complied with.\n\nTurkey, however, still chose to launch the incursion into Syria.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s had a great concern about their border,\u201d Pence said in defending the move. \u201cWhile the United States of America did not approve of their military crossing into Syria we have always endorsed a safe zone ... and we believe that the Kurdish population in Syria \u2014 with which we have a strong relationship \u2014 will continue to endure.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe United States will always be grateful for our partnership with SDF in defeating ISIS but we recognize the importance and value of a safe zone to create a buffer between Syria proper and the Kurdish population and the Turkish border.\u201d\n\nPence would not say what concessions were made to Turkey in getting them to accept the ceasefire, saying only \u201cI think you\u2019ll be able to see from the agreement itself, what concessions were made.\u201d\n\nHe later allowed that the U.S. had only agreed to lift the sanctions and that nothing else was offered or given to the Turks.\n\nUpdated at 2:45 p.m.", "description": "The United States and Turkey have reached a deal to temporarily suspend Ankara\u2019s incursion into northern Syria, Vice President Pence announced Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/syriaturkeyoffensiverasal-ain_101219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
