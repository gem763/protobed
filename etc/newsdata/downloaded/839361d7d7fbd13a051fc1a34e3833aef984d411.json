The plan includes a settlement mechanism for challenged bonds.\n\nAnnual debt service would be reduced to 9% of government revenue from 28%, according to the board.\n\nThe plan creates an independent reserve trust for Puerto Rico\u2019s pay-as-you-go public sector retirement system. Monthly pension payments totaling over $1,200 would be cut by 8.5%, affecting about 40% of retirees.\n\nSo far, Puerto Rico has won court approval for debt restructurings for its Government Development Bank and Sales Tax Financing Corporation known as COFINA. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority moved closer to exiting bankruptcy earlier this month when two holdout bond insurers joined a deal to restructure its debt.", "description": "Puerto Rico would reduce its core government debt by more than 60% under a restructuring proposal the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth's federally-created financial oversight board filed in court on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
