HI INSTAGRAM.\"\n\nJennifer decided to write in her bio: \"My friends call me Jen.\"\n\nSo far, the age-defying beauty is following 81 people and has racked up a massive 141,000 followers.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nFans of the former wife of Brad Pitt took to the comments to share their excitement of her joining the picture upload service.\n\nOne penned: \"I love this so much\" alongside a crying face.\n\nAnother added: \"This is a moment!.\"\n\nSome gushed: \"our besties all together!!!!!\" and \"Oh yeah mama!! Woooohooooo.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nJennifer's social media debut comes after she admitted she is not keen on taking part in a Friends reboot.\n\nDuring an interview on Howard Stern's Sirius XM Radio, the actress confessed that while she missed the show, a reboot wasn't a good idea.\n\nShe told the radio host: \"We all miss it every day. I would be nothing without it [\u2026] If there\u2019s a reboot of the show, it won\u2019t be as good as what it was, so why do it? It would ruin it.\"\n\nHer words echoed those of Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman who has always insisted that a reboot would never happen.\n\n(Image: NBC via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nShe famously said: \"The show is about a time in your life when your friends are your family. It's not that time anymore. All we'd be doing is putting those six actors back together, but the heart of the show would be gone.\"\n\nAniston was also asked about her dating life while on the radio show - but she firmly shifted the conversation back to her work.\n\nIn reply to a question about whether she was seeing anyone since her split from former husband Justin Theroux in 2017, she stated: \"I\u2019m very busy. For now. I\u2019m promoting [ The Morning Show ]. I\u2019m prepping for next season.\"", "description": "The actress has joined the social networking site with a Friends cast reunion picture - and they are all there", "authors": ["Sara-Aisha Kent", "Image", "Wireimage", "Instagram", "Nbc Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20094685.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_The-Morning-Show-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
