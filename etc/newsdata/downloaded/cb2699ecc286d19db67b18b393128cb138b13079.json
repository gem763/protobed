If the organization believes without a doubt that the potential client is innocent, it will do everything it can within the boundaries of the law to free an innocent person, investigating and pushing for a new trial.\n\nQuincy Miller has been in prison for 22 years - and still claims his innocence. A young lawyer was murdered, and suspicion quickly turned to Miller pulling the trigger. He says a fellow inmate fabricated a story about Miller confessing, and his ex-wife claimed that he owned several guns, which also wasn\u2019t true. Another witness lied about seeing him flee the scene. Miller swears he never owned a gun, wasn\u2019t anywhere in the area that night and that a key piece of evidence that later disappeared was planted.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit much to believe that so many folks would be involved in a miscarriage of justice, but Post believes Miller and begins to dig into what happened that fateful night.\n\nGrisham again delivers a suspenseful thriller mixed with powerful themes such as false incarceration, the death penalty and how the legal system shows prejudice. The Guardian team of characters is first-rate, and Miller\u2019s attitude and mannerisms will have readers questioning what truth means in the world of the legal system.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://www.jgrisham.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"The Guardians: a Novel,\" published by Doubleday, by John Grisham", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jeff Ayers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/book_review_-_the_guardians_99978_c0-984-2249-2295_s1200x700.jpg?36ed55b2e15ebb8e7c4915e8389f016eb18b337e", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
