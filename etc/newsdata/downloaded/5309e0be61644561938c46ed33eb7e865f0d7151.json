But, \u201cwe are not doomed unless we choose to be. My hope is that we can fix this crisis in time.\u201d\n\nRapinoe and her teammates were recognized for their \u201cchampioning of equal pay.\u201d After winning the women\u2019s World Cup this year, the team filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation alleging gender discrimination.\n\nRapinoe has publicly advocated for equal pay to her male soccer counterparts. She has also repeatedly bashed President Donald Trump, saying that she would refuse a visit to the White House.\n\nPeople honored Sen. Warren (D-MA) for her achievements in \u201cchanging the political conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a long time women have been shut out of the process, devalued, told to be quiet,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing that anymore.\u201d\n\nSen. Harris (D-CA) was also honored for shaking up politics. \u201cEvery position I went for, people said, \u2018It\u2019s not your time.\u2019 That\u2019s where I derive eternal optimism: the ability of the American people to see what can be, even if they\u2019ve never seen it before,\u201d Harris said.\n\nDespite accusations from ex-staffers who claimed that she was a verbally abusive boss, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) was also spotlighted for her achievements.\n\nCaptain Marvel star Brie Larson was also on this year\u2019s list, in recognition of \u201cspeaking up about injustices and lack of diversity in the film industry.\u201d\n\nPeople\u2018s list also includes Oprah Winfrey, and actresses Taraji P. Henson, Evan Rachel Wood and Zoe Saldana.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
