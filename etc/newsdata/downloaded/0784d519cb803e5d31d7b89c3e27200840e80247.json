(Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nAiling grandmothers, spouses and the toddlers of U.S. citizens are still being blocked from entering the United States under a travel ban that President Trump first imposed within days of taking office, his administration continuing to argue that people from five predominantly Muslim countries pose a national security threat.\n\nSince the initial rollout, in early 2017, of what critics and federal judges have branded a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d the Trump administration has fielded approximately 72,000 visa applications from the citizens of Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria, a U.S. State Department official told members of Congress on Tuesday. Approximately 10 percent of those applicants \u2014 7,679 \u2014 have received waivers to enter the United States, according to Edward Ramotowski, deputy assistant secretary for visa services at the department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs, who testified during a House judiciary and foreign affairs subcommittee hearing.\n\nThe hearing, the first before Congress on the subject of the travel restrictions since they were implemented, came as Trump spoke before the 74th session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, condemning \u201cglobalists\u201d and hailing the \u201ccherished history, culture and heritage\u201d that he said makes the United States great. He said that is something \u201cthe free world . . . must not attempt to erase.\u201d\n\n[Trump condemns globalism, touts nationalistic view of foreign affairs at U.N.]\n\nThe ban on U.S. entry by the citizens of several majority-Muslim countries hit repeated legal roadblocks during Trump\u2019s first year in office, as federal judges found that the ban, which followed his campaign pledge to enact a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d violated core principles of U.S. law.\n\nBut after the White House tweaked and revised its approach, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the third iteration of the policy last year, ruling 5-to-4 that it fell within the president\u2019s executive purview. The court accepted the administration\u2019s claim that the ban served a national security interest, in part because of its inclusion of a \u201cwaiver program\u201d that would allow certain humanitarian exceptions to the ban. Such examples include those seeking urgent medical care or trying to live with close family members who already are in the United States.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) pointed out that the countries Trump targeted derived from a list of nations the Obama administration had chosen for added scrutiny after the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris.\n\n[Trump\u2019s claim that Obama first \u2018identified\u2019 the 7 countries in his travel ban]\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration didn\u2019t just pull these names out of a hat,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cIt was using the same countries as the previous administration.\u201d\n\nRamotowski said the administration has granted \u201croughly half\u201d of the 7,600 waivers within the past two months, largely because of a shift to an automated processing system. He said security reviews were part of a \u201ctime-consuming manual process\u201d that led to a backlog of cases.\n\nHe and two officials from the Department of Homeland Security were unable to describe the specific national security rationale behind the inclusion of some countries on the list \u2014 and the exclusion of others \u2014 and Democratic lawmakers provided anecdotes of those affected by the restrictions, including a 2-year-old Libyan girl kept apart from her American mother, and a congressional staffer whose \u201c85-year-old Iranian grandmother\u201d has been prohibited from visiting.\n\nThe policy applies to nearly all citizens of majority-Muslim Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria, as well as to nearly all citizens of North Korea and some Venezuelan government officials. But the State Department received no applications from Venezuelans who would have been subject to the restrictions, and just 115 North Koreans sought entry, 72 percent of whom were allowed into the country through waivers or exceptions.\n\n\u201cI find it hard to fathom that that 2-year-old didn\u2019t face undue hardship,\u201d Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.) said of the Libyan girl, Omnia, during the hearing. \u201cI find it hard to fathom that that 2-year-old presented a national security risk.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also posed questions about countries not on the list.\n\n\u201cThe people who attacked us on 9/11 \u2014 they were from Saudi Arabia. They\u2019re not on the list,\u201d said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), chair of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s subcommittee on immigration and citizenship. \u201cRussia attacked us in the last election \u2014 they\u2019re not on the list.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Neumann, a DHS assistant secretary for threat prevention and security policy, said that she would be able to address country-specific questions only in a closed session.\n\nAbdollah Dehzangi, a computer science professor at Morgan State University in Baltimore, testified that the travel restrictions had prevented his wife, an Iranian scientist who had been offered a postdoctoral research position at the University of Maryland, from moving to be with him in the United States. Ismail Alghazali, who works in a Brooklyn bodega, said his Yemeni wife had delivered both of their children in the time they have spent waiting \u2014 now three years \u2014 for a visa to join him.\n\nRamotowski said he expects visa applications to be handled more quickly; each application includes automatic consideration of a possible waiver. There is no separate process through which to apply for a waiver after a visa application has been denied.\n\n\u201cI was completely dismayed by the lack of clarity on the waiver process,\u201d Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.,) who introduced a bill this year to overturn the restrictions, said in an interview. \u201cIt seemed to me that these bureaucrats could give no clarity on how it is supposed to work and why it isn\u2019t working.\u201d", "description": "Approximately 7,700 out of 72,000 applicants from Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria have been granted waivers, according to the Trump administration.", "authors": ["Abigail Hauslohner", "National Reporter Focusing On Immigrant Communities In America", "September At Pm", "Abigail Hauslohner Covers Immigrant Communities", "Immigration Policy On The Washington Post'S National Desk.
