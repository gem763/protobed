I want to play the best. It\u2019s great,\u201d added Darnold, who led the Jets to their first win in five games, a 24-22 triumph over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday, after missing three weeks due to mononucleosis.\n\nThe Jets are a 10-point underdog against the Patriots, who remain unbeaten after six games this season, based on early betting odds released by Jeff Sherman, Vice President of Risk Management of Super Book USA. In their first clash in Week 3, the Patriots entered as an overwhelming 21-point favorite but they failed to cover the spread after their special teams and offense gave up two touchdowns for the final score of 30-14.\n\nAlso, it was Luke Falk who played under center for the Jets as Darnold was sidelined due to mononucleosis. In Week 17 last season, the Patriots crushed the Jets, 38-3, even with Darnold calling the shots.\n\nPatriots to re-sign tight end Ben Watson\n\nDays after releasing him, the Patriots are bringing back veteran tight end Ben Watson, according to Field Yates of ESPN. Watson was eligible to play in Week 5 against the Washington Redskins after serving a four-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s substance-abuse policy, but he was not activated.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

NFL New England Patriots\n\nWatson became a free agent after the Patriots did not activate him before last Monday\u2019s deadline. Last week, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick explained the reason behind Watson\u2019s release, saying there was no room in the 53-man roster. However, the veteran mentor said there is a possibility that the Patriots might re-sign Watson. The door of opportunity, for Watson, opened when fullback Jakob Johnson landed on injured reserve, leaving a roster spot open.\n\nAs of now, the Patriots have only two tight ends, Ryan Izzo and Matt LaCosse. With Watson\u2019s return, Brady now has a veteran and dependable tight end that he could turn to. Brady and Watson played together with the Patriots from 2004 to 2009.\n\nBrady won\u2019t lobby for Gronkowski\u2019s return\n\nDespite accepting a broadcasting job with Fox Sports, retired tight end Rob Gronkowski fueled rumors of his comeback when he declared that he hasn\u2019t ruled out returning to the NFL.\n\nThere were reports that Gronkowski only needs a request from Brady for him to cut short his retirement and return to the field. However, Brady said in an interview on The Greg Hill Show that he won\u2019t lobby for Gronkowski\u2019s return, saying the retired tight end is enjoying his retirement life. \u201cHe seems to really be doing a lot of great things. He knows how I feel about him. I want what is best for him,\u201d said Brady, adding that only Gronkowski can decide for himself if he wants to return to the NFL.", "description": "The unbeaten Patriots (6-0) are eyeing a season sweep against the Jets.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Tony Romo Believes Patriots Might Go Undefeated", "Patriots Early Favorite Over Jets", "Patriots Rumor", "Insider Points To Fitzgerald", "Agholor", "Cobb"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/14/os/b_1200x630/darnold-led-the-jets-to-a-24-22-win-over-the-dallas-cowboys-image-source-new-york-jetsyoutube_2339275.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
