Sign up for the newsletter.\n\n\n\nStudents walk on Harvard University's campus in Cambridge, Mass. (Charles Krupa/AP)\n\nOn Wednesday, the verdict in the Harvard affirmative action lawsuit came down.\n\nJudge Allison Burroughs first ruled that Harvard University does not consciously or intentionally discriminate against Asian Americans. However, she also found that the school can and should do better for Asian Americans \u2014 but not by eliminating affirmative action.\n\nInstead, Burroughs stated Harvard\u2019s admissions process would benefit from conducting implicit bias trainings, maintaining clear guidelines on the use of race and closely monitoring race-related statistical disparities.\n\nShe ultimately concluded, \u201cThere is always the specter of perfection, but [the Constitution] does not require it.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s opinion defends both affirmative action and Asian Americans.\n\nThe ruling protected affirmative action but did not give Harvard a complete pass on discrimination against Asians, offering Asian Americans the opportunity to step into our place in the fight for racial equality.\n\nBurroughs openly acknowledged the challenges and stereotypes faced by Asian American applicants.\n\nFor instance, the court noted that Asian Americans were, more often than other groups, labeled \u201cstandard strong\u201d \u2014 a category Harvard uses for applicants who aren\u2019t \u201cdistinguished\u201d enough to get admitted.\n\nThe court also found it \u201cdifficult to explain\u201d the \u201canomalies\u201d in Harvard\u2019s criteria for sending recruitment materials, which last year disadvantaged Asian Americans by requiring them to have higher SAT scores to receive a recruitment letter.\n\nMost critically, the court found that \u201cthe disparity between white and Asian American applicants\u2019 personal ratings has not been fully and satisfactorily explained.\u201d\n\nThe personal score is a metric Harvard uses to rate applicants on such qualities as courage, likability and kindness. Litigation last year revealed that Harvard systematically gives Asian Americans lower personal scores.\n\nAs Burroughs told Harvard during trial, \"You [still] have a personal rating problem.\u201d\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with Burroughs that Harvard can do better. Harvard must work out a race-conscious admissions process that doesn\u2019t tolerate trading off Asian Americans. This is especially true now that Harvard knows bias against Asians has invaded its system and become, to use the court\u2019s words, \u201cbaked into\u201d the recipe.\n\nHarvard has already begun course correction. As a small concession, it amended its admissions guidelines last year to include explicit language that warns admissions officers about how to appropriately limit their consideration of an applicant\u2019s race.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to be done. For instance, Harvard\u2019s system of granting tips to legacies and recruited athletes disproportionately favors white students. Those who support educational diversity should confront Harvard\u2019s open stance that race diversity is not as important as Harvard\u2019s competitive standing in Ivy League intercollegiate sports.\n\nUplifting Asian Americans does not mean dismantling affirmative action, a longstanding, constitutionally backed policy that advances important goals of educational diversity and societal reparations. These goals benefit everyone, including the most vulnerable and disadvantaged Asian Americans.\n\nAsian Americans should keep defending affirmative action against \u201cattrition warfare,\u201d a phrase used by advocates to describe the persistent lawsuits challenging affirmative action over the past four decades.\n\nWe also need to begin openly attacking prejudice against Asians, unintentional and conscious, internalized and imposed. This involves a concentrated effort to locate Asian America, with all of its diversity and inner turmoil, in the kaleidoscope of U.S. race relations.\n\nIt may be tempting for many Asian Americans, and others, to dismiss this lawsuit as \u201ca hullabaloo by salty people who didn\u2019t get into Harvard,\u201d to quote an Asian American friend.\n\nBut we need to see the bigger picture. This lawsuit is symptomatic of larger questions that Asian Americans cannot continue avoiding, such as what it means to be Asian American, how to be allies for racial justice, assimilation versus representation and the widening socioeconomic gap within our communities.\n\nAt Harvard, students and alumni from all backgrounds must come together to organize for ethnic studies, hiring more minority professors and programming that will help us navigate how Asian Americans fit into the story of racial equality in the United States.\n\nThese conversations are critical because, beyond Harvard, Asian Americans face polarized struggles, with some anxiously navigating undocumented immigrant status while others are repeatedly passed up for the C-suite, despite their efforts to attain the \u201cright\u201d Ivy credentials.\n\nIn a moment when Asian Americans finally have the chance to begin telling and centering Asian American stories in the media and when two Democratic candidates \u2014 Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and businessman Andrew Yang \u2014 are vying to become the first Asian American president, these issues are critical.\n\nHow these conversations happen, and whether we help shape the narrative, is up to us.", "description": "The ruling did not give Harvard a complete pass on anti-Asian discrimination, offering Asian Americans the opportunity to find their place in the fight for racial equality.", "authors": ["Meghan Liu", "Freelance Writer", "October At Pm", "Meghan Liu Is A Graduate Of Harvard Law School.
