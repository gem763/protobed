Executive summary, WHO Strategic Advisory Group on Malaria Eradication", "language": "en", "text": "Overview\n\nAfter its 3-year study of trends and future projections for the factors and determinants that underpin malaria, the Strategic Advisory Group on Malaria Eradication (SAGme) reaffirms that eradication is a goal worth pursuing, likely to save millions of lives and billions of dollars. However, with our current tools, we are far from a malaria-free world.\n\nIn its executive summary, SAGme calls for more investment in research and development of new tools and approaches to fight malaria, stronger universal health coverage so that everyone can access the services they need, and better surveillance to guide a more targeted malaria response.\n\n", "description": "Executive summary", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
