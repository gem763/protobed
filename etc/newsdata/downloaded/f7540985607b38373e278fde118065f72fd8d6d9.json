It mirrors the sale of precious slots at Gatwick airport when Monarch collapsed two years ago; rather than selling them off piecemeal, the liquidators opted to sell them as a package, at over \u00a350m, to British Airways.\n\nNick Wyatt of GlobalData said: \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know the cost of the deal, what terms can be agreed with landlords for example, but this was most certainly a buyer\u2019s market situation so Hays should have been able to negotiate favourable terms.\n\n\u201cHays should be able to operate without the millstone of debt round its neck and the publicity around the Thomas Cook collapse may even spur people to seek out Atol protected package holidays for peace of mind, which will play into Hays\u2019 hands.\n\nHays Travel, based in Sunderland, began with a single shop in Seaham, County Durham. Its heartland is northeast England but expanded into the south with the purchase of Bath Travel. The latest acquisition will give it a nationwide presence and treble the number of travel agents.\n\nBut it will also mean that in some high streets it will have more than one store, with rationalisation a possibility at some point in the future.\n\nThe speed of the Hays transaction will raise further questions about the collapse of Thomas Cook. The company had been struggling beneath an immense debt burden for years. Had it sold its High Street travel agencies or, indeed, its airline, Thomas Cook may have been able to survive long enough to turn around the business.\n\nThe move will also increase calls for travel firms which run out of cash to be kept going under \u201ccreditor protection\u201d while buyers are sought for healthy parts of the business.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s airport slot portfolio, especially at Gatwick and Manchester, is also likely to be the target of multiple bids.\n\nSeparately, British Airways has begin moving in on the former Thomas Cook Airlines network. BA has announced new services from Gatwick to Antalya \u2013 a key destination for Thomas Cook before its failure \u2013 beginning in March 2020.\n\nThe airport serves a string of resorts on Turkey\u2019s Mediterranean coast.", "description": "All Thomas Cook stores in the UK will be acquired by a rival travel firm.
