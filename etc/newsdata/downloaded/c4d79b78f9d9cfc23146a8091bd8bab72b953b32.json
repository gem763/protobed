The Hendry County Sheriff\u2019s Office is treating the death as a homicide, and is investigating social media posts targeting Slater that were made prior to her murder.\n\n\u201cThere were some Facebook posts made \u2014 that this person needs to die,\u201d Hendry County Sheriff Steve Whidden told the Times. However, authorities are not yet considering Slater\u2019s death a hate crime. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything that would show that it\u2019s a hate crime right now,\u201d Sheriff Whidden said. \u201cWe possibly have a motive, but I can\u2019t say what that is at this time.\u201d\n\nSlater\u2019s friend, Antorris Williams, told Out that Slater posted about the threats online. \u201cShe posted messages saying she felt as if people were after her to attack and hurt her and she had a conversation with one of her best friends the day she was murdered saying she wanted to leave [the city],\u201d Williams said.\n\nAccording to the Human Rights Campaign, Slater was the 18th known trans person to be killed in 2019, with the majority of the deaths being black transgender women. According to the Miami Herald, a vigil for Slater was held last week. Friends said she was saving up for a new car and had talked about moving to Atlanta.\n\n\u201cShe always had a smile on her face. She always was caring,\u201d another friend, Desmond Vereen, said. \u201cShe always gave hugs and kisses, always told you that she loved you.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
