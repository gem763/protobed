Between Sept. 17 and Thursday, AECO has skyrocketed 422 per cent from 45 cents per thousand cubic feet to $2.35 per mcf on Thursday, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nNatural gas prices are up nearly 77 per cent year-to-date but have repeatedly fallen below $1 per mcf over that period. AECO prices started the year at $1.33 per mcf in January, traditionally seen as the middle of the high-demand winter heating period, peaking around $3 per mcf in February before collapsing in the summer, Bloomberg data shows.\n\nGas Alberta Inc., which provides natural gas to 74 gas distribution utilities in the province and sources its data from ICE NGX on its website, shows prices have surged around 292 per cent over the past 30 days.\n\nThe rally has buoyed the spirits of many embattled natural gas producers that had been forced to scale back their drilling plans and were allowing their production to decline in the face of prices that fallen to as low as 4 cents in late May and 7 cents in early June.\n\n\u201cInterest has piqued a little bit,\u201d Peyto Exploration and Development Corp. president and CEO Darren Gee said of investors taking another look at the Canadian gas sector. \u201cWe feel like we have a fighting chance\u201d to compete with other natural gas producers in the U.S., he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Gee published a report to shareholders called \u201cAECO is back in the game, baby!\u201d\n\nGee\u2019s report predicted a bull market over the winter as \u201cAECO storage levels are already dangerously low and will be completely empty when we get around to refilling them next summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmpty supplies this winter, followed by stronger demand next summer to refill storage, and then an expanded system in 2021 will ensure AECO will be a fair-gas market once again,\u201d he wrote.\n\nI don\u2019t perceive anybody will be going out to drill their brains out\n\nThe price of the commodity has been highly volatile as producers argued that a protocol put in place in the middle of 2017 by TC Energy Corp. created difficulties in accessing natural gas storage.\n\nGas prices had been steadily rising and then hit an inflection point at the beginning of October, when the Canada Energy Regulator approved an application championed by the Alberta government and supported by both the gas producers and TC Energy to revert to the old method.\n\nThe decision has propelled AECO gas prices and close the gap on Henry Hub natural gas prices in Louisiana, according to AltaCorp Capital data.\n\nThe Canadian gas sector is entering withdrawal season (first week of November) below the five-year low, with storage levels 27 per cent below the five-year average in a bullish scenario, analysts at the Calgary-based investment firm wrote in a research note on Oct. 11.\n\nDespite the improved fundamentals, AltaCorp Capital maintained its forecast for AECO prices at $1.70 per mcf through next April, which marks the end of the winter heating season.\n\nGas producers are also not getting carried away by the rally.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t perceive anybody will be going out to drill their brains out,\u201d Mah said.\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "The rally has buoyed the spirits of embattled producers forced to cut drilling because of rock-bottom prices", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/natgas.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
