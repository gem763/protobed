Their five earned runs against Cole handed the American League Cy Young Award candidate his first loss in five months. Zimmerman\u2019s home run was not only crucial for the team, searching for a spark against Cole after starter Max Scherzer allowed two runs in the first inning, but for himself, as well.\n\nAD\n\nRyan Zimmerman puts the Nationals on the board with his second home run of the postseason. pic.twitter.com/qFRkEa7yVh\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf7: @MLB \u2014 Post Sports (@PostSports) October 23, 2019\n\nThis season has been one of the most difficult of his career. The former ironman missed large portions of the last six seasons with injuries, but this year\u2019s ailment, plantar fasciitis in his right foot, proved especially frustrating. Every time he thought he was healing, the injury worsened. The prescribed rehab was waiting. He played in 52 games, the lowest full-season total of his career, and felt the fan base\u2019s frustrations mount.\n\nThe foot finally healed in mid-August, and Zimmerman felt himself finding a rhythm by the season\u2019s end. Manager Dave Martinez still played Zimmerman only against left-handed starters early in the playoffs because his career-long struggles against right-handed pitchers have worsened over the years. Then, in Game 4 of the National League Division Series, Zimmerman crushed a dramatic, game-breaking home run off Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Pedro Baez. Martinez has stuck with him since and, on Tuesday, became emotional when Zimmerman homered off the best right-handed pitcher he\u2019s faced all year.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, my eyes got a little watery for him,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe waited a long time to be in this position.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe subtext of this season, of this run, is that each postseason series win has prolonged his time with the team by at least another day. Beyond this World Series, the 35-year-old has an uncertain future with the only organization he\u2019s ever known. He\u2019s in the final year of his six-year, $100 million contract extension, and he knows the team won\u2019t pick up his $18 million option for 2020. Uncertainty lurks beneath every moment \u2014 the Baez home run, this one in the World Series \u2014 because the question remains: Is this Zimmerman\u2019s final great act as a National?\n\nHis teammates don\u2019t think about it. Shortstop Trea Turner saw the veteran voice of the clubhouse \u201chaving a blast.\u201d Right fielder Adam Eaton praised his leadership. Scherzer pointed out that, in a time when baseball\u2019s average age dips every season, Zimmerman embodies qualities missed by data analytics. He hustles out every groundball, provides a fundamental example to others, stays steady no matter what.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all just ecstatic to see him go out there and have this kind of postseason,\u201d said Scherzer, adding, \u201cAll the old guys are stepping up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAge and tenure give Zimmerman unparalleled perspective into what this run means not only for his teammates but his city. The Virginia Beach native has seen the fan base react to this run unlike anything before it. The lack of professional baseball in Washington for so long forfeited the generations on which the league now thrives. But Zimmerman has seen the fan base \u201cgrow up,\u201d and he compared it to the neighborhood around the ballpark.\n\n\u201cIt's been fun to grow with the fans, with the community, with the city, to watch them become baseball fans,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nAD\n\nAfter it was all over Tuesday night, after the clubhouse mostly emptied, Zimmerman walked in wearing a T-shirt and gym shorts. He\u2019d wrapped his news conference and now found himself sorting through a wooden locker. He tossed his phone in the cubby and then paused. This situation would have seemed impossible two weeks ago, but here he was. Ryan Zimmerman was helping lead the Nationals in the World Series. His locker was still full.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The original National described running around the bases as \u201cfloating.\u201d", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ugMaFxjMMmiQ44YlTnSP3hhHCHM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X25XTLHVFYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
