REUTERS/Juan Carlos Ulate\n\nSAN JOSE (Reuters) - Costa Rican Finance Minister Rocio Aguilar resigned on Wednesday in the middle of a fiscal reform push aimed at avoiding problems with future debt payments, but which has been sharply criticized over austerity measures.\n\nAguilar, a 62-year-old lawyer, stepped down after being formally rebuked by the country\u2019s comptroller, which called for Aguilar to be suspended from her post after accusing her of authorizing public debt payments last year without congressional approval.\n\nAguilar told a news conference that she disagreed with the comptroller\u2019s determination.\n\n\u201cI only regret not achieving more things in fiscal matters,\u201d she said.\n\nPresident Carlos Alvarado praised Aguilar\u2019s record as minister in a post on Twitter. \u201cHer hard work was key to stabilizing and cleaning up public finances,\u201d he said.\n\nAguilar\u2019s resignation was welcomed by many upset with her support for austerity measures, but lamented by those who support the fiscal reform she backed along with the Congress. The reform includes a tax hike plus limits on public worker salaries.\n\nCosta Rica\u2019s economy is expected to grow 2.6% this year, which would be the country\u2019s lowest expansion rate in a decade.", "description": "Costa Rican Finance Minister Rocio Aguilar resigned on Wednesday in the middle of a fiscal reform push aimed at avoiding problems with future debt payments, but which has been sharply criticized over austerity measures.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444313480&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N018", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
