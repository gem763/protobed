Harsh Vardhan Shringla accused Islamabad of conducting a misinformation campaign over the recent tensions in Kashmir and denied that the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is conducting a Hindu nationalist policy bent on ending Muslim dominance in Kashmir and of undermining minority rights in the world\u2019s most populous democracy.\n\n\u201cSome of our detractors are spreading false rumors, including through the U.S. media and it is malicious in nature,\u201d Indian Ambassador Harsh Vardhan Shringla told The Washington Times on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe Pakistanis would like to make [Kashmir] a religious and sectarian issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not. India has the second-largest Muslim population in the world \u2014 200 million Muslims \u2014 and I have not seen any instances where the Muslim community has voiced any disaffection over the very courageous initiative we have embarked upon in Jammu and Kashmir.\u201d\n\nThe envoy in the interview also weighed in on India\u2019s larger foreign policy goals, the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with China and U.S. unease over India\u2019s reported pursuit of advanced S-400 missiles from Russia.\n\nWhile he declined to comment specifically on an S-400 deal \u2014 saying only that \u201cIndia has to maintain a minimum deterrence capability\u201d \u2014 the ambassador extensively praised the depths of the U.S.-India \u201cstrategic relationship\u201d under President Trump.\n\n\u201cIndia is the major defense partner of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThe largest military exercises we have with any country are with the United States.\u201d\n\nIndia has felt the sting of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Iran and its clash with the socialist government of Venezuela \u2014 both exporters of oil to India. The Modi government has acquiesced to U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil purchases, but has voiced subtle criticisms of the trade restrictions and has not cut all ties to Tehran.\n\nAmbassador Shringla also sought to cast a positive light on the U.S.-India trade relationship. The United States is India\u2019s second-largest trading partner, but only the 18th largest export market for American goods \u2014 an imbalance that President Trump has criticized in the past.\n\nTrade tensions flared up this summer when the U.S. ended tariff-free treatment on some $5.6 billion of Indian exports, ruling that India no longer qualified for preferential treatment as a developing economy. The Modi government soon after announced new tariffs on more than two dozen U.S. products, including almonds and apples, in retaliation for higher duties the U.S. had previously imposed on India steel and aluminum exports.\n\nWhile India may benefit from an extended U.S.-China trade war, the ambassador said New Delhi is sensitive to American criticisms of its market access and tariff policies.\n\n\u201cIndia has made a conscious effort to buy more American goods,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last year alone, we have bought $4.5 billion dollars of U.S. oil and gas and placed orders for 300 [American-made] civilian aircraft worth $39 billion, and in the last ten years, we\u2019ve bought $18 billion of U.S. defense equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has reduced the adverse trade balance and that\u2019s our objective towards meeting the Trump administration\u2019s requirement that there is a more equitable trade.\u201d\n\nSetting the record straight\n\nThe Indian ambassador made no secret of his main priority Thursday \u2014 to counter the harsh Pakistani criticisms of the escalation of tensions in Kashmir, as well as Mr. Modi\u2019s decision to revoke the territory\u2019s special constitutional status as a semi-autonomous state.\n\nPakistani Amb. Asad Majeed Khan told The Times last week that \u201cthousands\u201d of Kashmiris had been imprisoned by India and that the Indian military was turning a vast section of the Muslim majority Himalayan territory into \u201cpractically a concentration camp.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn all fairness,\u201d Ambassador Shringla said, \u201cwe would certainly ask that any such allegation be brought to us so that we can respond to it with the facts on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone not able to reach their families is welcome to contact me or my colleagues in the Indian embassy and we will make sure that they reach their families,\u201d he said, adding that any measures Indian forces took last month in the Indian-controlled area known as Jammu and Kashmir have almost entirely been pulled back in recent weeks.\n\nElectricity is back, telephone lines are being restored and there is no shortage of medicine or hospital access, the ambassador said, although he acknowledged that there have been some \u201cpolitical detentions\u201d of Kashmiris now being held \u201cunder house arrest.\u201d\n\n\u201cNumbers are not exactly known to me, a few hundred are what authorities have mentioned,\u201d he said, asserting that in order to ensure the success of the Indian government\u2019s plan for Jammu and Kashmir, \u201cwe had to initiate a certain amount of cautionary and preventative measures.\u201d\n\nKashmir\u2019s status was \u2018temporary\u2019\n\nAmbassador Shringla argues that New Delhi\u2019s decision to remove the semi-autonomous status of Indian-controlled Kashmir violated no past treaties between India and Pakistan, which have controlled different parts of the divided Himalayan territory since 1947.\n\nThe Modi government acted, he said, in large part because of the mandate the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured in elections earlier this year. The BJP currently enjoys an \u201cabsolute majority\u201d in the Indian parliament \u2014 the first such majority over the legislative body in a nearly 50 years.\n\n\u201cThe government of India has followed the due legislative process,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cTwo bills were introduced in Indian parliament and were passed by a two-thirds majority.\u201d\n\nThe move was also justified as a way to bring development and investment to the Kashmir economy, which has lagged behind the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cThe political elite in the state essentially fostered a culture of nepotism and corruption,\u201d Ambassador Shringla said, resulting in a \u201cmoribund economy\u201d for young Kashmiris who were then preyed upon by Pakistan.\n\nIslamabad has \u201cfacilitated cross-border terrorism and the incitement of violence\u201d in the territory, he said. \u201cWhat the Indian government is offering now in Jammu and Kashmir is the prospect of good governance, the delivery of social justice and economic development.\u201d\n\nMr. Modi \u201chas talked about making Jammu and Kashmir the tourism hub of the world in the next five years,\u201d Ambassador Shringla said. \u201cWe are talking about huge investments in areas that Jammu and Kashmir is already known for \u2014 its tourism, its film industry, horticulture and handicrafts and other traditional industries.\u201d\n\nPrivate investment will follow, the ambassador claimed, asserting \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d in private money is expected from a major conference being organized next month.\n\nHindu nationalism?\n\nAmbassador Shringla scoffed at the characterization of Mr. Modi as a Hindu nationalist who sees India as a historic Hindu homeland and seeks to turn Jammu and Kashmir into a Hindu-majority state.\n\nSuch charges have dogged Mr. Modi since he was chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat in 2002, when it was rocked by brutal sectarian violence between Hindus and Muslims. That history haunted Mr. Modi upon his rise to prime minister in 2014, when the State Department briefly banned him from entering the United States because of allegations he\u2019d played a role in fomenting the violence.\n\nAmbassador Shringla said attention would be better focused Mr. Modi\u2019s five subsequent visits to the United States since 2014, noting that \u201cthere have been no instances of communal violence or rioting between [Hindus and Muslims in India] since he became prime minister.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first thing the prime minister said after being re-elected last year was that wants to build a strong and prosperous and inclusive India,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cIndia is a secular democratic republic. Communities live together. They live peacefully and in harmony and you don\u2019t have the sort of acrimony between religions that Pakistan is raising.\u201d\n\nMr. Modi, he added, \u201cis a man who has the best interests of Indians in mind, whether they are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Farsis, Jews or of any other religion, Buddhists. The important thing is that the country has to grow, the country has to develop and the country has to prosper. That is our priority. It is not our priority to create animosity between religions and that certainly not intended in Jammu and Kashmir.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
