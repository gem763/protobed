Where we are in our life?\u2019\n\nShe then added that while she was up for baby number four, singer Robbie isn\u2019t as convinced as she is.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d like one more but after that I think Rob would commit me somewhere and run away with Gary Barlow into the sunset!\u2019 she laughed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, Ayda said that Coco is getting plenty of attention from her older siblings, with the age gap meaning they think less of her as a threat and more a toy to play with.\n\nMore: Loose Women Loose Women's Chizzy Akudolu recalls shocking moment she had to flee from gunman Ruth Langsford and Coleen Nolan clash over Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's move to US Stacey Solomon claims 'you never make any money' on X Factor\n\n\u2018The difference is because Teddy and Charlie were so close in age, they didn\u2019t dote on each other, they were more jealous,\u2019 the star said. \u2018Whereas with Coco they want to feed her and play with her and show her things, she\u2019s a living doll for them.\n\n\u2018Sometimes I have to remind them she\u2019s my child and I\u2019m in charge but they\u2019re the best siblings but I think Coco will want a teammate to rally against her brother and sister, but they\u2019re such an amazing unit.\u2019\n\nLoose Women airs weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
