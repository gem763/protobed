It also comes with a $40 credit to ride to and from the pickup location.\n\nRates are fairly similar to those of some legacy car-rental companies like Enterprise and Avis among others ($40 to $80 per day, depending on the type of vehicle). A Volkswagen Passat, for example, was offered at $75 per day when Business Insider reporters tried out the service on Friday. Other options are the Volkswagen Atlas, Mazda 3, and the Mazda CX-5.\n\nSee also: Apply here to attend IGNITION: Transportation, an event focused on the future of transportation, in San Francisco on October 22.\n\nThe minimum age for Lyft's car-rental service is 22-years-old, the company says, and there doesn't appear to be an extra fee for drivers under 25, as with most car-rental companies.\n\nThe test is an extension of other transportation forms Lyft has recently expanded into, like bikes and scooters, a representative said. The company has long said it wants to see a world where no one owns personal vehicles and they are instead shared. This seems to be another move in that direction.\n\nLyft has long offered drivers on its platform the option to rent cars through a program called Express Drive. That's made possible through a partnership with Avis Budget Group, FlexDrive, and Hertz.", "description": "The ride-hailing company will now let you hail a rental car in three California cities, and give you a ride credit to get to the pickup location.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72becd2e22af362c000877-1536-768.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
