Rather than the elliptical orbit that objects in our own solar system have as they fly around the Sun, the new object's movement has a hyperbolic shape, suggesting it is on a journey through the solar system rather than around it.\n\nThe rock would follow 'Oumuamua, the first interstellar object ever observed in our solar system, which was first spotted in 2017 and has been mystifying scientists ever since. Scientists still know very little about the unusual object, and its strange behaviour was so unusual that it even led some to suggest it could actually be an alien spacecraft.\n\nIf the new object is in fact another interstellar visitor, it could shed light on that mysterious object. And it would mark a major breakthrough in our understanding of how such objects are flung through the universe.\n\nThe new object was first spotted at the end of August, by an amateur astronomer called Gennady Borisov who saw it through a telescope he made himself. He posted the possible discovery online and other researchers rushed to confirm it.\n\nIt has now been spotted through other observations, which have allowed astronomers to learn more about it. That extra work did indeed suggest that it was another visitor to our solar system, prompting Harvard's Minor Planet Center to release an official report on the object.\n\nRead more\n\nScientists perplexed by mysterious alien space rock\n\n\"Based on the available observations, the orbit solution for this object has converged to the hyperbolic elements shown below, which would indicate an interstellar origin,\" it wrote. \"A number of other orbit computers have reached similar conclusions, initially D. Farnocchia (JPL), W. Gray, and D. Tholen (UoH).\n\n\"Further observations are clearly very desirable, as all currently-available observations have been obtained at small solar elongations and low elevations. Absent an unexpected fading or disintegration, this object should be observable for at least a year.\"\n\nOne of the things that made 'Oumuamua so inscrutable to scientists was that it was spotted on its way out of the solar system, giving them only a very limited time to make any observations of it. The new object looks as if it will be around for longer, giving astronomers much more of an opportunity to try and understand what it is and where it came from.\n\nFor now, the object is called C/2019 Q4 (Borisov), the Minor Planet Center said. Further observations will be required to confirm that it is indeed an interstellar traveller, at which point it will be given an updated name.\n\nMichele Bannister, a scientist from Queen's University Belfast who worked on the discovery and examination of Oumuamua, tweeted to warn that objects with similar orbits had been spotted before \u2013 and then found to be more normal than we had realised.\n\n\"This is not the first object since 2017/1I, better known as \u02bbOumuamua, to show a hyperbolic orbit,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"Several short-arcs have flourished and slid slowly into the demise of straightforward parabolas.", "description": "Astronomers might have spotted an interstellar visitor to our solar system, for only the second ever time.A mysterious rock, which has been speeding through space towards Earth, might have made its way from an entirely different star.", "authors": ["Andrew Griffin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3KnsEReRpcMDOTfUvetmjg--~B/aD0zMzU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/bb329c9e23a97c584d38b2dcf95825b0", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
