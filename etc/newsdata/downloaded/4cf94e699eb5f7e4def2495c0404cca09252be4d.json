[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nPlanned Hebei skating venues will promote winter sports\n\nHebei province in North China will build more than 100 public skating venues in the next two years in an effort to promote winter sports across the province, its top sports authority said.\n\nAccording to the Hebei provincial Administration of Sport, every one of the province's over 100 counties will have skating facilities and competitions by the end of this year, and the province will have at least 200 indoor public skating venues by the end of 2020.\n\nThis is one of the province's moves to reach the target that a total of 30 million people in the province, accounting for 40 percent of its total, can participate in winter sports by 2022, the administration said.\n\nThe province, which surrounds the country's capital, and Beijing will hold the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Chongli district, Zhangjiakou city. Most of the Games' snow events will be held in the district.\n\nSince the bid for the Games succeeded in 2015, the province has striven to strengthen its winter sports infrastructure and promote winter sports in the province, including offering skiing and skating venues.\n\nAt present, the province only has 17 indoor skating venues, which is far from the target, it said.\n\nTo step up the pace of building the skating venues, the province held a fair and meetings on Saturday, attended by government officials, winter sports equipment manufacturers and companies for constructing and managing winter sports venues, to help them reach cooperative agreements.\n\nA company from neighboring Shandong province in East China is planning to invest 1 billion yuan ($142 million) to build skating venues in Hebei, while another from Austria has reached agreements with 20 counties, according to a report by Hebei Daily.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/29/5db7bbbca310cf3e97a36077.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
