Sure, they know how to hold a press conference or write a law or conduct a study. But no person or group of people has the power to impose their will on society. There are just too many chefs making the soup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, people have the power to try stuff in the same way generals have the authority to send troops into battle, but as General James Mattis likes to say, \u201cThe enemy gets a vote.\u201d And in politics and public policy, the enemy isn\u2019t merely the opposing party or hostile voters, but life \u2014 that vast realm of existence governed as much by Murphy\u2019s Law as by Washington\u2019s laws. Facts are stubborn things. The world is complicated.\n\nAfter Barack Obama got his stimulus passed on the promise that there were millions of \u201cshovel-ready jobs,\u201d the stimulation never quite materialized as planned, and the shovels tended to stay in the shed. Obama later insisted that the theory behind the stimulus was right, but \u201cthe problem is that spending it out takes a long time, because there\u2019s really nothing \u2014 there\u2019s no such thing as shovel-ready projects.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a hard lesson for people who put immense faith in government to do big, important things. The technocratic New Dealers were sure they were smart enough to allocate resources better than the market. To that end, in 1933, when millions of Americans were going hungry, the government slaughtered some 6 million pigs and threw away the meat in an effort to drive up pork prices. Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace was convinced America was on the verge of creating a new society.\n\n\u201cOnly the merest quarter-turn of the heart separates us from a material abundance beyond the fondest dream of anyone present,\u201d he told a crowd in Des Moines, Iowa. All we had to do was resist the urge to act like dogs returning \u201cto the vomit of capitalism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCapitalism nauseates because we come into this world with programming for a \u201cStone Age conception of clan life,\u201d as economist Michael Munger puts it. Our brains are wired to expect someone to be in charge. When bad things happen, it must be because someone intended it. We get angry at perceived slights, inconveniences, and tragedies, and our anger needs a target.\n\nThis wiring was perfectly adapted for a zero-sum world where resources were finite, and political and economic transactions were essentially face-to-face and communal. But in a world where the price of a bag of rice from India is influenced by political turmoil in Indonesia and heavy rains in Arkansas, never mind the overproduction of potatoes (a substitute for expensive rice) in Russia or the Netherlands, blaming your local grocer for charging an extra 50 cents is silly. But it\u2019s still natural.\n\nWhen gas prices are \u201ctoo high,\u201d many politicians blame oil companies for \u201cgouging.\u201d When prices are low, these same politicians insist that oil companies shouldn\u2019t drill, build pipelines, or open new refineries. That one result is correlated to the other is irrelevant to the need to aim anger at someone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe need to blame is a core driver of conspiratorial thinking. When bad things happen, we look for beneficiaries and then reason backwards that they must have been responsible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes recently floated the idea on Twitter that Obama\u2019s failure to goose the economy was a conspiracy. The excuses that big business offered for low investment or wage growth were proven wrong by today\u2019s economic boom, Hayes argued (with varying degrees of plausibility). But then he added, \u201cAn even less charitable interpretation: they didn\u2019t get it wrong at all. They didn\u2019t want full employment, they didn\u2019t want wage growth and empowered workers and they certainly didn\u2019t want that happening under a Democratic president.\u201d\n\nThe idea that tens of thousands of businesses chose to needlessly keep wages low \u2014 or even go out of business \u2014 lest they lend aid and comfort to Obama is preposterous. Because what is true of politicians is also true of everybody else. No one is really in charge of anything, except for a few things in front of their noses and in their heads, and even then control is often an illusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s nobody behind the curtain pulling the strings. We\u2019re all on the stage together, playing our parts.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency LLC", "description": "The need to blame is a core driver of conspiratorial thinking.
