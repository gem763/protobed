That's what Domino's Japan has in store for the foolhardy thrill-seekers who dare to order their new \"Halloween Roulette\" coming out on Oct 14, a pizza with one randomly selected slice spiked with ghost pepper (aka Bhut Jolokia).\n\nDomino's Japan \"Halloween Roulette\" Pizza\n\nWhen it comes to Scoville units, the unit of measure used to quantify spiciness in foods, Jalape\u00f1o peppers range from 2,500 to 8,000, while ghost peppers are between 855,000 and 1,040,000. In other words, ghost peppers are at least over 100 times hotter and can be over 400 times hotter than Jalape\u00f1os if you compare the low and high extremes of each pepper variety. And that's not even considering the fact that pickled Jalape\u00f1os, the type you'll find on a Domino's pizza, are milder than fresh ones, so the difference is even greater.\n\nFortunately (or unfortunately, if you're a spice maniac), only a small ampule of ghost pepper sauce is used, so the one who gets the spicy slice in this pizza version of Russian Roulette won't suffer unbearably.\n\nThose who are up for the challenge can order the \"Halloween Roulette\" option (one slice selected at random spiked with ghost pepper) free of charge on any medium, regular, or large pizza they order between Oct 14 and Nov 4.\n\nIf you're planning it for a party, keep in mind that medium and regular pizzas have eight slices and that large pizzas have 12. If you're into odds and probabilities, that's a 12.5% or an 8.3% chance, respectively, if you're starting from a whole pie. According to their press release, it's hard to tell which slice is spiked at first glance, so you can enjoy the thrill of not knowing which slice is \"the one.\"\n\nYou can add the option on a pepperoni pizza like the one pictured above, or, if you're really hardcore, add it to a Spicy Pizza with two extra Jalape\u00f1o pepper toppings (for a total of three)!\n\nIf you're ordering more than one pizza and are worried you might get the Halloween Roulette pizza mixed up with another pie you ordered, Domino's Japan has it covered, literally, with a special sticker clearly identifying the pizza as \"Halloween Roulette\".\n\nSocial media campaign\n\nIf you live in Japan, you can also participate in a lottery for a chance to win 20,000 yen in cash. Simply post a picture between Oct 14 7 p.m. and Nov 4 11:59 p.m. of you enjoying the Halloween Roulette challenge on your Twitter, Instagram or TikTok account with the hashtag #\u30c9\u30df\u30ce\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30eb\u30fc\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8. Be sure to follow Domino's Japan's account on the platform (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok) you're posting to first, or you won't be able to receive the direct message informing you of your prize.\n\nVisit the campaign page for more details.
