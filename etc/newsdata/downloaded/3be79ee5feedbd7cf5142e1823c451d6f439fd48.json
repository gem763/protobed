Veuer\u2019s Lenneia Batiste has more on how it will work. Buzz60\n\nInstagram is strengthening its approach to suicide-related content after facing pressure for how it promoted disturbing posts that could be viewed by teens.\n\nEarlier this year, Instagram launched a ban on most of the graphic content on the heels of public outcry in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn Sunday, the social media company said it is now \"taking more steps to keep the people who use Instagram safe.\" It will start removing renderings, drawings and memes that show methods of self-harm or suicide from the app.\n\n\u201cThis past month, we further expanded our policies to prohibit more types of self-harm,\" Instagram said in a blog post.\n\n\"We will no longer allow fictional depictions of self-harm or suicide on Instagram, such as drawings or memes or content from films or comics that use graphic imagery. We will also remove other imagery that may not show self-harm or suicide, but does include associated materials or methods.\u201d\n\nKnock-off cars: Are those fake Lamborghinis and Bugattis sold online just about fun?

Here's what you should keep in mind\n\n(Photo: Instagram)\n\nAccounts that share graphic content will no longer be recommended in search, and the platform is increasing the visibility of localized helplines like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and The Trevor Project in the U.S.\n\nThe move back in February followed the death of a British teen. Her father, Ian Russell, believes Instagram was partly responsible for her suicide.\n\nMolly Russell died by suicide in 2017 after viewing graphic content on the photo-sharing app. Her father has since publicly called out Instagram for not doing enough to keep teens from viewing self-harm-related content.\n\nIn 2019, the company's algorithms removed and reduced the visibility of more than 834,000 pieces of content, Instagram said.\n\nContent about suicide can be a touchy subject and complex issue for social networking websites that receive conflicting guidance from users and experts.\n\n\"Experts tell us that giving people a chance to share their most difficult moments and their stories of recovery can be a vital means of support,\" Instagram says.\n\nHowever, content that could be helpful to some may be harmful or triggering to others, the Facebook-owned company said.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_ Brown.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/28/instagram-suicide-content-ban-now-cover-cartoons-and-memes/2483433001/", "description": "Instagram will now remove renderings, drawings and memes that show methods of self-harm or suicide from its app.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Published A.M.
