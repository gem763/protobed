A Google spokesperson said the firm is reviewing the allegations and engaging with the ACCC. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: This isn\u2019t the first time Google has come under fire for this particular Android issue\u2014in August 2018, following an Associated Press investigation, the firm changed its privacy policy to reflect the two-settings requirement. The Australian regulator is suing Google for its policies before that change, and for what it called an ongoing failure to adequately inform users about how it uses their data. This is the latest in a series of global regulatory actions against tech giants\u2019 data practices, and the first major lawsuit by the Australian watchdog following the July release of its Digital Platforms Inquiry report. The watchdog can impose a fine on a company in three ways: AU$10 million; triple the benefit it received from the wrongdoing; or 10 per cent of a company\u2019s annual turnover in Australia. Google made US$136.22 billion in global revenue last year.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
