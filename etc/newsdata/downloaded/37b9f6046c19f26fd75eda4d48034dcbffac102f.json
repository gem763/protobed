If a majority of House members back impeachment, the matter shifts to a trial in the Senate, currently controlled by Republicans.\n\nThe letter capped a day of explosive developments that included Trump barring a key witness, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, from speaking to Congress \u2014 calling it a \u201ctotally compromised kangaroo court.\u201d\n\nIn response, Democrats slapped Sondland with a subpoena that \u201ccompels\u201d him to appear on October 16.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Stonewalling\u2019 \u2013\n\nPelosi formally launched the impeachment inquiry last month after revelations Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky in a controversial July 25 phone call.\n\nThe top Democrat in Congress told reporters preventing Sondland from testifying shows that \u201cthe president is obstructing Congress from getting the facts that we need.\u201d\n\nBiden, the former vice president who is seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination, joined the chorus of condemnation, tweeting that Trump \u201cmust stop stonewalling Congress.\u201d\n\nSondland, a major donor to Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, was one of a handful of US diplomats on a text message chain between July and September that go to the heart of the investigation.\n\nThe messages involving Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani show them coordinating to pressure Kiev into investigating Biden, as the country sought US military aid and access.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said investigators have learned that Sondland has text messages or emails on a personal device that are \u201cdeeply relevant\u201d to the probe, but that State is withholding them.\n\n\u201cThe failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents\u201d was \u201cadditional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress,\u201d Schiff told reporters.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Above the law?\u2019 \u2013\n\nLawmakers have an opportunity on Friday to hear from another key witness in the Ukraine scandal: former US ambassador to Kiev Marie Yovanovitch, who is scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nUS media has reported that Trump removed her from her post because she opposed his efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nIt was unclear whether Trump will block Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony.\n\nFollowing the White House\u2019s letter, members of the Trump administration will not be authorized to testify in Congress and will ignore subpoenas, a senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters.\n\nHe insisted that the White House was \u201cdefinitely avoiding saying there\u2019s no way we\u2019d ever cooperate,\u201d but he declined to discuss \u201chypothetical situations\u201d in which a change might come.\n\nRepublicans were largely silent following the White House\u2019s explosive gambit, but Democrats were quick to portray a reckless president defying lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s letter shows he believes he\u2019s above the law,\u201d 2020 White House hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s on Congress to prove him wrong.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 A defiant White House declared war Tuesday against the impeachment investigation of Donald Trump, blasting the process as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/2d3a75_us-president-donald-trump-impeachment-investigation-him-is-kangaroo-court-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
