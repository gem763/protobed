Rosen \u2013 drafted 10th by the Cardinals the year before \u2013 previously started 13 games in Arizona, completing 55.2 per cent of his passes for 2,278 yards and 11 touchdowns with 14 interceptions.\n\nRamsey expects to be traded by next week\n\nJacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey will play against the Tennessee Titans, but reportedly does not expect to be a member of the team by next Sunday. Where he is headed could be anyone's guess considering almost every team have at least placed a call expressing interest.\n\nRamsey requested a trade after he was seen arguing with Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone on the sidelines during last week's game. However, Ramsey held a news conference addressing his trade request, saying neither he nor his agent wanted the news of the request to be leaked and that he was focused on being a good team-mate, not a \"distraction.\"\n\nNewton misses third straight practice\n\nStory continues\n\nCarolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton remains in a walking boot after aggravating his foot injury, prompting speculation that Kyle Allen will get the start against the Cardinals on Sunday. Despite telling reporters he would not address Newton's status, coach Ron Rivera was pressed about his availability and left his news conference early in frustration.\n\nAllen has been taking the first-team reps in practice this week, hinting the Scottsdale, Arizona, native could face off against former Texas A&M team-mates Murray and Christian Kirk. He completed 16 of 27 passes for 228 yards and two touchdowns in his one start against the Saints last season as he filled in for Newton.\n\nTwo things that don't matter\n\nBrees staying in LA to start thumb rehab\n\nIt was reported New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees' surgery \"went perfect\" and should keep him within the initial six-week recovery timeline. In the meantime, Brees is expected to remain in Los Angeles, where he will work and start his thumb rehab.\n\nBrees suffered a torn ligament in his right (throwing) thumb last Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams and underwent surgery Wednesday to repair the damage. The Saints opted not to place him on injured reserve, meaning they expect him to make his return within eight weeks.\n\nNike drops Brown amid sexual assault allegations\n\nThe receiver signed with the New England Patriots after a tumultuous offseason with the Oakland Raiders. Just one day later, Brown was accused of sexual assault and rape by his former trainer Britney Taylor.\n\nEarlier this week, a second unnamed woman accused Brown of sexual misconduct.\n\nBrown has denied all allegations and made his debut with New England last week, but sponsors have been distancing themselves from the wideout following the news. Xenith ended its sponsorship with him last week and Nike has also reportedly dropped him. Despite that though, he continues to focus on football and will be on the field again when the Patriots host the New York Jets on Sunday.\n\nOne video you have to see\n\nDespite his crazy start to 2019, Brown appears focused on football going forward.\n\nThursday's tweet of the day\n\nSunday's matchup in Dallas is shaping up to be an interesting game after the Dolphins reportedly claimed Taco Charlton off waivers and swapped starting quarterbacks.", "description": "The Miami Dolphins turn to Josh Rosen as Carolina Panthers QB Cam Newton continues to struggle with injury.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CiRAiphzKI6VXN2zbe.eKA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PfPhK7D1Vk_yx.dlLpa67w--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/829849a0db6baf0029a8410147c93982", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
