It was only later that they found out the source of the mistaken information, he said. Speaking at a meeting of the National Weather Association, Uccellini said Birmingham forecasters \u201cdid what any office would do to protect the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did that with one thing in mind: public safety,\u201d said Uccellini, who prompted a standing ovation from hundreds of forecasters by asking members of the Birmingham weather staff to stand. Earlier, the president of the 2,100-member association, Paul Schlatter, said any forecast office \u201cwould have done the exact same thing\u201d as the Birmingham forecast office.\n\nTrump has defended his tweet about Alabama, and he displayed an altered forecast map in the Oval Office last week in an attempt to make his point.
