This is because they have been closing in on a merger with Dutch rival Takeaway.com.\n\nProsus went public with a 710p per share offer for Just Eat on Tuesday\n\nThe hope behind this is that by combining forces they will become more than the sum of their parts, and have the scale to grab and hold a major slice of the relatively new, potentially lucrative market for takeaway food delivery.\n\nThis would in time see the share price grow well beyond 710p, if all goes to plan.\n\nAs little as around ten years ago all you could get delivered was pizza. Perhaps a curry if you were lucky. Now the world is your oyster, with very few types of food not available via one app or another.\n\nThe problem is that as with most good ideas, a lot of people are aiming to do the same.\n\nMost notably, there is Deliveroo. It has a different model in that the drivers and riders work directly for it rather than the myriad of takeaway food outlets, but the end result for customers is largely the same.\n\nDeliveroo, which has Amazon behind it now, represents tough competition for Just Eat\n\nIt also now has a backer with exceptionally deep pockets and reach you may have heard of - Amazon.\n\nThen there is Uber Eats, which is another formidable competitor, given it has so much in place on the taxi side that can be readily transferred to a takeaway delivery service.\n\nIt already has a successful partnership with the ever-popular McDonalds.\n\nTo top this off, the fact that there are few barriers to entry for this business model should give shareholders pause for thought.\n\nYou don't have to look far to see examples of good tech ideas that have been copied to within an inch of their life. App-based banks or wealth managers for example.\n\nPredictably shareholders are calling for more money. Aberdeen Standard yesterday joined SM Trust and Cat Rock in saying 710p is not enough, but it would consider backing Prosus' proposal if it increased this. Between them the three investors control a fifth of shares in Just Eat.\n\nIn a hostile takeover situation you rarely see shareholders accept the first offer. There is a dance that usually take place, with the bidder not making its real best offer until after at least a couple of low-ball ones have been floated to gauge the lay of the land.\n\nThis reality is reflected clearly in the Just Eat share price sitting some way above the 710p on the table at the moment.\n\nIt is not immediately obvious what the clever move is here.\n\nTo a large extent it depends on how long you are happy to stay invested, combined with your views on how the takeaway delivery market will develop over the next several years.\n\nI'm not a shareholder in any of the firms involved, but if I was a Just Eat holder and Prosus put another 10 per cent or more on its cash offer I think I'd grab it and run.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Just Eat shareholders knew exactly where they stood and were likely to have been pretty happy with it until Tuesday morning.", "authors": ["Alex Sebastian For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
