Expectations are for 160,000 jobs to have been created in August. Given the rebound in the in the previous session investors could be hoping for a slightly stronger figure today.\n\nAnd they could be right. There are several data points which indicate that the number of jobs created in August will surprise to the upside.\n\n1) private payrolls surprised to the upside with the largest increase in private sector jobs in 4 months\n\n2) J remained low with no signs of rising layoffs\n\nHowever, there has also been a slew of data which indicates that the NFP could actually disappoint.\n\n1) Whilst U.S. non-manufacturing print impressed, the employment component of the report was a cause for concern, dropping to the lowest level in 2 years. Given the dominance of the service sector in the U.S. economy, there is a strong correlation between the ISM non-manufacturing employment component and the NFP. This is arguably a stronger lead indicator than the ADP (NASDAQ: ) private payrolls print.\n\n2) The manufacturing sector is experiencing a slump.

Erosion of consumer confidence due to the ongoing U.S. \u2013 Sino trade dispute is now well underway, which, whilst there is no trade war solution in sight, doesn\u2019t bode well for the U.S. economy or the labour market.\n\nA print below 150k could well be in the pipeline and will disappoint. A weak figure could stoke slowdown and recession fears in the U.S. economy, boosting expectations of further intervention from the . Under this scenario we expect the dollar to fall.\n\nGBPUSD levels to watch:\n\nGBP/USD Chart\n\nAfter three days of Brexit inspired gains GBPUSD has been moving lower in early trade on Friday. A weak US NFP report could see the pair push through resistance at $1.2355 and target $1.24. A stronger than forecast NFP could send GBPUSD lower, testing resistance at $1.2245 prior to $1.2210.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Fiona Cincotta covering: GBP/USD, US Dollar Index Futures, Automatic Data Processing Inc.
