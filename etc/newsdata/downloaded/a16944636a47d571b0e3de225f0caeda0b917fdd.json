After that, the Braves left-hander retired his last 19 hitters in the most dominating performance of his big career. He struck out nine and needed just 90 pitches to breeze past the Nationals.\n\nAfter Fried was lifted for a pinch-hitter, Shane Green eased through the eighth allowing only a walk.\n\nMark Melancon made things interesting in the ninth, giving up a two-run homer to Victor Robles and a single to Juan Soto that brought the potential tying run to the plate. Howie Kendrick hit a game-ending groundout.\n\nThe Braves jumped on Strasburg (16-5) for two runs in the first, sparked by Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr.\u2019s leadoff single. Acu\u00f1a added to the lead in the fifth with his 37th homer, a drive into the Chop House restaurant. Right fielder Michael Taylor took only a couple of steps before stopping to watch the ball sail into the dinner crowd.\n\nStrasberg turned in another strong outing, giving up just four hits before he was pulled after the sixth. He walked four and struck out seven.\n\nTrailing the Braves by seven games with just over three weeks left, the wild card-leading Nationals likely needed to win at least three of four in SunTrust Park to have any chance to overtake the Braves and avoid the wild-card game.\n\nThanks to Fried, the task got even harder.\n\nThe Braves jumped on Strasburg right away. Acu\u00f1a started the first with a single, snatched second with his 34th stolen base and came home on Ozzie Albies\u2019 bloop double down the left-field line. Freddie Freeman extended the lead with a run-scoring single. Strasburg escaped further trouble by striking out Dansby Swanson with Freeman at third.\n\nStrasburg dominated after that - until he fell behind Acuna in the fifth. The youngster received the green light on a 3-0 pitch and got every bit of Strasburg\u2019s 94-mph fastball.\n\nBrian McCann added an RBI single in the eighth.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nNationals: OF Adam Eaton struck out as a pinch hitter ending the eighth after missing the previous two games. He\u2019s still recovering from a painful bone bruise, the result of taking a pitch off his right knee last week. Eaton tried to play through the injury, but he was finally forced to the bench after lasting only two innings in his last start on Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s still sore,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said before the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a brutal area to get hit in. It\u2019s going to take some time, but it\u2019s getting better.\u201d\n\nBraves: RHP Darren O\u2019Day is finally back in the big leagues and looking to make his first appearance in nearly 15 months. The Braves added O\u2019Day to their expanded active roster after he completed a rehab stint in the minors. He last pitched in the majors with the Baltimore Orioles on June 26, 2018, before season-ending hamstring surgery. He was traded to the Braves and expecting to return this season, only to be sidelined for much of the year by a forearm strain. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s excited as he can be to get back,\u201d manager Brian Snitker said. \u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAtlanta LHP Dallas Keuchel (6-5, 3.72 ERA) will go Friday in the second game of the series. He\u2019ll be looking for his fourth straight win, having allowed just three runs over 25 innings in his last four appearances. The Nationals will counter with LHP Patrick Corbin (11-6, 3.19), who will be facing the Braves for the third time this season. He won while surrendering four runs in 11 innings over those two previous appearances.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Max Fried pitched one-hit ball over seven innings to outduel Stephen Strasburg and push the Atlanta Braves a step closer to their second straight NL East title, beating the Washington Nationals 4-2 in the opener of a four-game series between the division's top two teams Thursday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Newberry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/Nationals_Braves_Baseball_97877.jpg-1bf23_c0-424-1709-1420_s1770x1032.jpg?647357a9e647bf48be0582440f58cfa7fccee0c4", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
