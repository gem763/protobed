But a defiant Johnson said he still aimed to meet the deadline and would not \u201cnegotiate\u201d a postponement with the EU. The bloc said it would wait to hear from the British government about what it wanted to do next.\n\nAt a rare weekend sitting of Parliament, lawmakers voted 322-306 to withhold their approval on the Brexit deal until legislation to implement it has been passed.\n\nThe vote aims to ensure that the U.K. cannot crash out of the EU without a divorce deal on the scheduled departure date. Johnson, who struck the agreement with the EU earlier this week, said he was not \u201cdaunted or dismayed\u201d by the result and would push ahead.\n\nHe implied he would request a three-month delay as required but argued against any postponement.\n\n\u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI will tell our friends and colleagues in the EU exactly what I\u2019ve told everyone in the last 88 days that I\u2019ve served as prime minister: that further delay would be bad for this country, bad for the European Union and bad for democracy.\u201d\n\nParliament\u2019s first weekend sitting since the Falklands War of 1982 had been dubbed \u201cSuper Saturday.\u201d It looked set to bring Britain\u2019s Brexit saga to a head, more than three years after the country\u2019s divisive decision to leave the EU.\n\nBut the government\u2019s hopes were derailed when House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he would allow a vote on an amendment that puts the vote on the deal off until another day.\n\nThe amendment makes support for the deal conditional on the legislation to implement it being passed by Parliament, something that could take several days or weeks. It also gives lawmakers another chance to scrutinize \u2014 and possibly change\u2014 the Brexit departure terms while the legislation is passing through Parliament.\n\nThe government still hopes it can pass the needed legislation by the end of the month so the U.K. can leave on time.\n\nThe leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the government would hold a debate Monday on its Brexit-implementing legislation \u2014 effectively a second attempt to secure approval for the deal.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether that would be allowed under House of Commons rules against holding repeated votes on the same question. Bercow said he would make a ruling on Monday.\n\nOpposition lawmakers warned that Johnson must ask for the Brexit extension or face legal consequences.\n\n\u201cAny failure of a prime minister who thinks he is above the law \u2014 well, prime minister, you\u2019ll find yourself in court,\u201d said Ian Blackford of the Scottish National Party.\n\nThere was drama both inside Parliament and outside, where tens of thousands of anti-Brexit demonstrators marched to Parliament Square, demanding a new referendum on whether Britain should leave the EU or remain. Protesters, many wearing blue berets emblazoned with yellow stars symbolizing the EU flag, poured out of subway trains and buses for the last-ditch effort.\n\nBruce Nicole, an Anglican vicar from Camberley southwest of London, said the Brexit deal would harm Britain.\n\n\u201cI fervently believe that we should remain in the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cI am British, but I am also European.\u201d\n\nInside Parliament, Johnson implored legislators to ratify the deal with the bloc\u2019s 27 other leaders. He said members of the House of Commons should \u201ccome together as democrats to end this debilitating feud\u201d over Brexit, which has bitterly divided the country since British voters narrowly chose in a 2016 vote to leave the EU.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for this great House of Commons to come together ... as I believe people at home are hoping and expecting,\u201d Johnson told lawmakers.\n\nJohnson called any delay to Britain\u2019s Brexit departure date \u201cpointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\u201d And he warned Saturday that the bloc\u2019s approval could not be guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThere is very little appetite among our friends in the EU for this business to be protracted by one extra day,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey have had three and a half years of this debate.\u201d\n\nEU leaders have made the same point. French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday that \u201cthe Oct. 31 date must be respected. I don\u2019t believe new delays should be granted.\u201d\n\nThe EU was guarded in its response to Saturday\u2019s vote.\n\n\u201cIt will be for the U.K. government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible,\u201d EU Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva tweeted.\n\nWhen push comes to shove, the EU seems likely to grant an extension if needed to avoid a disruptive no-deal Brexit.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said his country saw the vote as a delay, rather than a rejection of the Brexit deal. For EU leaders, avoiding a chaotic, no-deal Brexit should be the \u201ctop priority,\u201d he said in a tweet.\n\nAnd the European Parliament\u2019s chief Brexit official, Guy Verhofstadt, noted that time was now tight to get the deal approved by the EU legislature before Oct. 31, meaning a short delay might be needed.\n\nIf Parliament approves the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in time, Britain could still leave by the end of October. The government plans to introduce the bill next week and could hold late-night sittings of Parliament in hope of getting it passed within days.\n\nJohnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, failed three times to get lawmakers behind her Brexit plan.\n\nHis hopes of getting the deal through Parliament were dealt a blow when his Northern Ireland ally, the Democratic Unionist Party, said it would not back him. The party says Johnson\u2019s Brexit package \u2014 which carves out special status for Northern Ireland to keep an open border with EU member Ireland \u2014 is bad for the region and weakens its bonds with the rest of the U.K.\n\nTo make up for the votes of 10 DUP lawmakers, Johnson has tried to persuade members of the left-of-center Labour Party to support the deal. Late Friday the government promised to bolster protections for the environment and workers\u2019 rights to allay Labour fears that the Conservative government plans to slash those protections after Brexit.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed those promises as inadequate.\n\n\u201cThis deal is not good for jobs, damaging for industry and a threat to our environment and natural world,\u201d he said. \u201cSupporting the government this afternoon would merely fire the starting pistol in a race to the bottom in regulations and standards.\u201d\n\nCurrency markets are likely to react sharply to the vote in Britain\u2019s Parliament on Saturday on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nOn Friday the euro EURUSD, +0.1164% rose 0.36% to an almost two-month high of $1.1162 while sterling GBPUSD, -0.0231% climbed 0.42% to a fresh five-month high of $1.2942 on hopes for a resolution of the Brexit issue.\n\nIn London on Friday, the FTSE 100 stock index UKX, -0.44% closed 0.44% lower at 7150.67.\n\n___", "description": "In a major blow to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, U.K. lawmakers voted Saturday to postpone a decision on whether to back his Brexit deal with the...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "Associated Press", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT652_ap_bre_ZG_20191019122158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
