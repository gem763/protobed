So she asked her stylist, Andrea Lieberman, for more options.\n\nLater, Lieberman presented her with three options: \"a white one, a green one\" and one Lopez had tried on at the last fitting.\n\n\"I tried on the green one and when I came out ... everybody was like 'That's the dress! That is the dress, that's what you're wearing. Let's go,' \" Lopez recalled.\n\nJennifer Lopez onstage at the 2000 Grammy Awards. More\n\nBut not quite everyone loved the look: Lieberman said it wouldn't be a good move for Lopez because it had been worn before by multiple stars, including Sandra Bullock and Spice Girl Geri Halliwell. \"Donatella (Versace) herself has worn it,\" she told Lopez.\n\nThe \"Hustlers\" star, now 50, stood her ground.\n\n\"I said, 'This is what we're going to wear,' \" Lopez recalled. \"I didn't think it was all that risque, to be honest. I was more excited that it was the Grammys. I wasn't really even thinking about the dress that much. I was just glad I had something to wear.\"\n\nLopez remembered being met with buzz that night on the red carpet and Grammys stage alike. The dress left little to the imagination, and it seemed others were worried a wardrobe malfunction was inevitable.\n\n\"It's nothing. It was all taped down,\" she said. \"But that was the moment that kind of captured people's imaginations, I think.\"\n\nLopez closed out the Versace show Friday during Milan Fashion Week to much applause in a version of the famous dress that managed to show more skin than the daring original. It featured short sleeves and cutouts on the sides to showcase Lopez's toned abs.\n\n\"So this just happened,\" Lopez captioned a video of her fierce catwalk at Versace's 2020 Spring collection. She added the hashtags #stillgoingstrong and #20yearanniversary.\n\n\"In terms of my career, this dress really marked a moment in time,\" Lopez added to Vogue about the significance of her original look. \"(Even if) you don't know my music and you don't know my movies, people know about that moment and that dress. That was it.\"\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson, USA TODAY.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Jennifer Lopez was warned against wearing that green Grammys dress", "description": "After Jennifer Lopez again broke the internet with a\u00a0jungle-print Versace gown, she's looking back on the Grammys dress that started it all.", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XDBt05EENhR52EOVinFaAQ--~B/aD0xNzI4O3c9MTE1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_entertainment_893/b280c0e412b1f83b03bc327aef74e17b", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
