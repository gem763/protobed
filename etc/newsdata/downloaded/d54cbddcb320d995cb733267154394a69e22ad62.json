But what an embarrassment to their husbands, no thought of their kids.\u2019\n\n\u2018Tanya didn\u2019t seek fame for herself,\u2019 Susanna said.\n\n\u2018She turned it away,\u2019 Vinnie replied.\n\nLast week, Coleen accused Rebekah of selling stories about her to the press in a post shared on Instagram and Twitter that read: \u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\nColleen Rooney accused Rebekah Vardy of selling stories to the press (Instagram)\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\u2019\n\nColeen continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\nRebekah (right) clapped back at Coleen\u2019s claims (Picture: Getty/Rex)\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nRebekah fired back in her own statement, writing: \u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\u2019\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
