After 20 years, I found a story that speaks to me.", "language": "en", "text": "A decade after my childhood abuse stopped, I experienced rape at the hands of a stranger. When I told others what had happened, they quickly recognized it for the violation it was. Not a single person questioned me \u2014 in fact, they empathized with me. My pain, my PTSD, was validated because of the circumstances of the assault \u2014 it was dark, it was an alleyway \u2014 and the identity of the attacker: an older male stranger. Their easy belief in that particular story, though, is not necessarily a good thing, because the flipside of it means that other stories, stories that break away from what we have been told violation looks like, are less easily believed. I experienced this firsthand, all those times I tried to talk about the abuse in my childhood.", "description": "My abuser was a female peer, close to my own age, and both of us were still children", "authors": ["Katie Simon", "Katie Simon Is Currently Working On A Memoir About The Year She Got The Plague."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/a6-SCQaxokeMHPbM3NkksrwNtFY=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZSXPMTOJ4JDKHB5QRHJWI3RACE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
