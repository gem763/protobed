The singer put his career on hold in 2010 after being accused of military service evasion. [YONHAP]\n\nNine tumultuous years after his career was put on hold for suspected military service evasion, MC Mong is back with his eighth full-length album \u201cChannel 8.\u201dThe once-successful singer had made a few releases after evasion accusations surfaced in 2010, but with \u201cChannel 8,\u201d MC Mong did something he hadn\u2019t done for nearly a decade - hold a press conference and face questions from reporters.\u201cThis feels like a dream and I\u2019m a bit disoriented. I hope you understand if I stutter when I\u2019m talking,\u201d MC Mong told press at Yes 24 Live Hall in eastern Seoul on Friday. The singer, who was known for his outgoing personality before the scandal, was visibly soft-spoken and somber, choosing his words carefully.\u201cI named this album \u2018Channel\u2019 because it\u2019s my biographical story. My life 10 years ago and today are so different. My priority now is to have an average life, something I still haven\u2019t been able to achieve. This press conference is the first step of courage I\u2019m taking towards that direction.\u201dMC Mong, who was hugely popular for his hits \u201cCircus\u201d (2008) and \u201cIce Cream\u201d (2006), has since become one of the most vilified figures in Korea\u2019s entertainment industry. Although the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that MC Mong was innocent of deliberately removing his teeth to avoid military conscription, he was still sentenced to six months in prison for using other tactics to delay his mandatory duties. In a country where all able-bodied men are required to spend nearly two years doing military service, MC Mong was scorned for his actions and much of the public remains upset with the singer to this day.Negative comments targeted towards MC Mong often extend to other artists who work with him. When asked about whether he was worried that rising trot singer Song Ga-in would face backlash for appearing in the album\u2019s title track \u201cFame,\u201d MC Mong said that he hoped \u201cshe doesn\u2019t face any damages for her participation,\u201d adding that \u201cshe judged the song solely based on its music.\u201dWhile many of the songs in \u201cChannel 8\u201d express MC Mong\u2019s painful experiences like not leaving the home for a whole month, \u201cFame\u201d seems like an extension of his playful hits like \u201cCircus,\u201d featuring vibrant colors, dancing and a lot of Korean elements.\u201cI\u2019ve gone to counselling and the advice I got was to stop staying at home and go outside. People were unexpectedly welcoming, and I think that\u2019s also why I was able to get the courage to create such an upbeat song,\u201d MC Mong reflected.BY KIM EUN-JIN [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/25195207.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
