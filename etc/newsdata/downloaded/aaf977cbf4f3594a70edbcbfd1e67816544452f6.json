That\u2019s where Do Not Disturb settings come in. They temporarily stop calls from getting in the way.\n\nHowever, sometimes life gets complicated. You may not want your phone to ring if just anyone is calling, but you also don\u2019t want to miss a call from your kid, spouse, best friend, or pet sitter. No problem. Here\u2019s how to get notified of calls and texts while in Do Not Disturb mode on your iPhone.\n\nGet calls from a group of contacts\n\nSince iOS 12, it\u2019s been easy to make an exception for a group of contacts on the Do Not Disturb settings screens. To add a group:\n\nOpen Settings\n\nTap \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d\n\nToggle Do Not Disturb to \u201con\u201d\n\nIn the Phone section of the screen, tap \u201cAllow Calls From\u201d\n\nYou can choose to allow calls from Everyone, No One, or the contacts you\u2019ve selected as Favorites. You can also make an exception for an existing Contacts group. (You can only create a Group using iCloud on your Mac.)\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\nGet calls from individual contacts\n\nIf there\u2019s an individual contact who you want to hear from, but they are not on your Favorites list, you can still make an exception to Do Not Disturb on a person-by-person basis.\n\nOpen Contacts\n\nSelect the entry for the person you want to bypass DND\n\nTap \u201cEdit\u201d in the card\u2019s upper right corner\n\nScroll down to \u201cRingtone\u201d and tap it\n\nAt the top of the next card, toggle Emergency Bypass to \u201con.\u201d That allows calls from that person to bypass Do Not Disturb.\n\nBefore you tap \u201cDone\u201d to finish, stop and think for a moment. You might not want to miss a call, but if you don\u2019t want to interrupt a meeting, you may want to set a more subtle ringtone or alert sound for that person than your usual ringtone.\n\nYou can also let texts from an individual bypass DND. Go back to the person\u2019s Contact card, tap \u201cEdit,\u201d and tap \u201cText Tone.\u201d\n\nToggle Emergency Bypass to \u201con.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one way that Text Tone differs from Ringtone: where calls require some kind of sound to be selected, you can turn off text alarm sounds completely, relying on just vibrations to notify you. (As always, you can select from an array of vibration patterns or create your own.)\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalls or messages from important individuals (even if they\u2019re not marked as Favorites) will now get through to you, whether your Do Not Disturb is active or not.", "description": "When you\u2019re watching a movie, in a meeting, or just want to be mellow, you may not want your phone to interrupt whatever you\u2019re doing.
