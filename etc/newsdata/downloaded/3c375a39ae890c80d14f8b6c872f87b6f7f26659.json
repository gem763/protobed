How strange! Jenner went out to the Hyde nightclub in Los Angeles on Saturday night, accompanied by her friend, Catherine Paiz, and sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. Also at the club? Tyga and Kardashian\u2019s ex-husband, Lamar Odom.\n\nE! News reported that the exes all left at different times and couldn\u2019t confirm whether they interacted with their former flames.\n\nJenner\u2019s split with Travis Scott was announced earlier this week, though both have publicly said that they remain friends and will continue to focus on their child, Stormi.\n\nShortly after the announcement, Jenner was seen heading to a studio with friends where Tyga was at. She quickly attempted to clear the air on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe internet makes everything 100 times more dramatic than what it really is,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere was no '2am date with Tyga'. You see me drop two of my friends off at a studio that he happened to be at.\u201d\n\nIn the next tweet, she addressed her current relationship with Scott.\n\n\u201cTravis and i are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi,\u201d she added. \u201cOur friendship and our daughter is priority.\u201d\n\nAllegations of Scott\u2019s cheating surfaced after the couple\u2019s split went public, something he denied via his Instagram stories.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really affecting when u see false things said about u,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOnce again these false stories about me cheating are just simply not true. Focusing on life, music, and family at this moment is what\u2019s real.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Weird how this keeps happening?", "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3E94KZJuUp11pqcW5AyZcQ--~B/aD0xMTcxO3c9MjMzMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/42c522ab75794050c48b21dbe5889339", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
