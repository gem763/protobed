A metres-thick floe measuring roughly 2.5km by 3.5km was eventually chosen.\n\nThe international expedition considers itself lucky to have identified its home so soon after departing Troms\u00f8. This summer's warmth has produced the second smallest Arctic sea-ice extent in the satellite era. As a consequence, the ice capping the ocean surface is very thin.\n\nImage copyright Markus Rex Image caption The ship has been enjoying some of its last direct sunlight until next year\n\nThe floes, though, are now succumbing to the winter freeze-up. The Sun no longer rises above the horizon at the ship's location and it won't be long before the 24-hour darkness of \"polar night\" descends on the MOSAiC expedition.\n\nRV Polarstern will soon be locked solid in the ice.\n\nThe vessel won't break free again until September or October next year, by which time it will have drifted past the North Pole and be in waters somewhere in the Fram Strait. This is the passage that runs between northeast Greenland and the Svalbard archipelago.\n\nMOSAiC's objective is to study all aspects of the climate system in the Arctic. Instrument stations will be set up on the ice all around the ship, including some up to 50km away.\n\nThe ice, the ocean, the atmosphere, even the wildlife will all be sampled. The year-long investigations are designed to give more certainty to the projections of future change.\n\nImage copyright Esther Horvath Image caption The ice needs to be thick enough and strong enough to support scientists and their instruments\n\nProf Rex told the BBC before departure that the Arctic was currently warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet but that the climate models were highly uncertain as to how this temperature trend would develop in the coming decades.\n\n\"We don't have any robust climate predictions for the Arctic and the reason is we don't understand the processes there very well,\" he explained.\n\n\"That's because we were never able to observe them year-round, and certainly not in winter when the ice is at its thickest and we can't break it with our research vessels.\"\n\nSomething similar to the \u20ac130m (\u00a3120m/$150m) MOSAiC mission has been tried before, but nothing comparable in scale.\n\nAbout 600 scientists are expected to spend months at a time with the Polarstern.\n\nThey'll be brought in by the support icebreakers.\n\nWhen that's not possible at the height of winter, when the sea-ice is at its thickest, aircraft and long-range helicopters will have to deliver the necessary supplies and relief teams.", "description": "The research vessel is spearheading the biggest ever scientific expedition at the North Pole.", "authors": ["Jonathan Amos", "Bbc Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/179A8/production/_109108669_20191002_mosaic_polarsternfederov_estherhorvath-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
