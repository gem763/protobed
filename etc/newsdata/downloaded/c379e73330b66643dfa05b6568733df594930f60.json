The last few years have seen a wave of new hotels arriving in the city, seriously expanding the range of interesting options to stay within \u2013 and, most encouragingly, beyond \u2013 the well-trodden cobbled streets of its immediate historic core. Even existing properties have been dealt a much needed jolt and upped their game.\n\nHaving grown up here, I\u2019ve watched this happen as I come back now every couple of months, walking past construction sites that give new life to listed buildings and, where possible, bring in something new altogether. Here are 15 of the best hotels in Amsterdam at the moment.\n\nThe Independent's hotel reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust. On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and book, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis was the first international venture for the Hoxton hotel group when it opened in 2015, branching out from its namesake area in east London. Walking into the lobby on Herengracht canal, the Dutch capital feels like a natural fit for the brand\u2019s relaxed vibe, with vintage furniture in reds, yellows and blues contrasting against dark wood floors and exposed brick.\n\nAt the heart of the hotel\u2019s ground floor is brasserie Lotti\u2019s; upstairs there are 111 rooms, with the same dark wood floors, tan leather headboards and pale green and deep blue on the walls. They range from Shoebox to Roomy; there are also three unique \u201cconcept rooms\u201d (Fruity, Floral, and Tubby \u2013 the first Hoxton room with a bathtub). The hotel\u2019s location in De Negen Straatjes (Nine Streets) area means there is loads to see and do on your doorstep, while much of the city is only a stroll away.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac129, B&B (a small breakfast bag)\n\nthehoxton.com\n\nNot one to do things under the radar, W Hotels arrived with a bang in 2015, occupying two buildings: a former telephone exchange and a bank, which square off against each other across the street, directly behind the Royal Palace. An extra, glass-walled floor was added to the exchange building, housing the reception, lounge, and a steakhouse \u2013 not to mention a narrow outdoor swimming pool for those brave enough to swim surrounded by guests at the bar.\n\nThe 238 rooms and suites are classified by, and take design inspiration from, their respective buildings and the city \u2013 think copper-pipe pendant lighting, a gilded miniature bank vault as the minibar, and toilet cubicles painted bright orange. Restaurant The Duchess occupies the hall of the bank, burgers are served at local favourite The Butcher. There\u2019s also a gym and spa, as well as a retail and exhibit space.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac300, room only\n\nwamsterdam.com\n\nKimpton\u2019s first hotel outside the US can be found on Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal, just minutes from Centraal Station \u2013 it\u2019s a revamp of a dreary Crowne Plaza and opened in 2017.\n\nDon\u2019t be put off by the nondescript exterior: rooms are seriously stylish throughout (there are 270 in total, with strong blues playing off whites and greys; a junior suite with pitched roof and exposed beams is big on charm), and the hotel incorporates a number of 17th-century buildings, including Little House \u2013 the childhood home of Dutch playwright PC Hooft transformed into a three-floor suite. The moody cocktail bar is worth a stop too.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac289, room only\n\nkimptondewitthotel.com\n\nTravelling with friends and can\u2019t decide on budget? The Exchange \u2013 like its loftily-monikered sibling Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy \u2013 solves your problem by offering one-star to five-star hotel rooms under one roof. All unique, they were designed by students from the Amsterdam Fashion Institute using the theme \u201crooms dressed as models\u201d. They didn\u2019t hold back \u2013 the Eighties Room, for starters, displays an oversized black and white patterned sweater with candy-coloured stripes along the walls.\n\nYou\u2019ll find The Exchange on Damrak, the street that connects Centraal Station with Dam Square, opposite the former stock exchange. The area\u2019s about as tourist-central as you can get, worth bearing in mind for those preferring a quieter location.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac130 (1 star) or \u20ac290 (5 star), room only\n\nhoteltheexchange.com\n\nLike citizenM before it, Zoku is a new Dutch brand with plans to shake up the hotel industry on a global level. Its first location is on Weesperstraat, in the southeast section of the canal belt, roughly midway between the Hermitage and Artis Zoo.\n\nOn the top floor are social spaces both practical (communal working areas, launderette) and light-hearted (games corner, hanging punching bags for excess energy release), while Zoku\u2019s \u201cCommunity Manager\u201d and their \u201cSidekicks\u201d are on hand to help you make new connections, set you up with a VanMoof bike, or point you to the morning yoga class.\n\nAppropriately for a former office building, the majority of the 133 accommodations are its signature \u201chome-office hybrid\u201d lofts. They come in three sizes and have a kitchen, work table and loft-style sleeping space that can be screened off for privacy.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac165, B&B\n\nlivezoku.com\n\nAmsterdam tends to be an expensive city for hostels, but when it comes to stylish digs at affordable prices, you can\u2019t do much better than Generator\u2019s \u201cposh-tel\u201d. You\u2019ll find it near Oosterpark, inside a zoological university building dating back to 1917 \u2013 you can play table tennis in the old library, while the bar is in a former lecture hall.\n\nTravel solo and your cheapest option is taking a bunkbed in a quad room; both these and all twin rooms come with private en suite bathrooms. With a group you can opt for the top-floor Sky Suite, which throws in a lounge and kitchen to host up to six people.\n\nBeds from \u20ac20, doubles from \u20ac75, room only\n\ngeneratorhostels.com\n\nThis grande dame \u2013 no fewer than 25 canal houses from the 17th and 18th centuries cobbled together \u2013 has transformed itself during 18 months of recent renovations, reopening in 2016. Behind the restored Prinsengracht fa\u00e7ade now lie 225 rooms dressed in white, purple, light blue and mustard; some suites have their own private entrance on the canal.\n\nThe standout feature is the hotel\u2019s private garden, in the middle of it all yet seemingly miles away. Don\u2019t miss wandering the corridors of the hotel; as they twist and turn, you can clearly see the transition from one canal house to the next, with glass-covered passageways offering unexpected views of the city. The hotel\u2019s private boat also offers tour of the city\u2019s canals.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac288, room only\n\npulitzeramsterdam.com\n\nA few minutes\u2019 walk from the Pulitzer, Andaz Prinsengracht\u2019s plain post-war exterior (it used to be a public library) reveals little of the Marcel Wanders-designed interiors inside.\n\nFrom the giant bells overhead in the lobby to the fish murals and hand-made Delft blue wash basins in the rooms, there\u2019s plenty to see. Go for a room with a terrace to get rare private outdoor space. To see the city, hop on on the complimentary 90-minute Sunday morning cycle tour around town.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac350, room only\n\namsterdamprinsengracht.andaz.hyatt.com\n\nLike living below sea level, building on reclaimed land is nothing unusual in the Netherlands. You can experience both when staying at Room Mate Aitana, the 285-room hotel of the fun, millennial-focused Spanish group built on the IJdok island northwest of Centraal station, beside a pretty marina.\n\nFloor-to-ceiling windows in all rooms are one of the perks of a brand new, glass-and-steel building, while interiors (by Spanish designer Tom\u00e1s Al\u00eda) range from muted greys to apple green, bright red, and deep purple. The bar serves no fewer than 50 types of beer and 10 kinds of gin and tonic.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac158, B&B\n\nroom-matehotels.com\n\nJust across the water from Centraal station (a free public ferry gets you there, alongside local commuters), Sir Adam is the second property of Sir Hotels in the city. While its sibling Albert set up in an old diamond factory, Adam is part of the 22-storey A\u2019DAM Tower, the redevelopment of the former Royal Dutch Shell offices \u2013 you\u2019ll find the futuristic EYE Film museum next door.\n\nFrom here, you have a different perspective on Amsterdam, looking back at the city \u2013 especially from one of the higher rooms. The 110 rooms take inspiration from the area\u2019s industrial heritage with bare concrete walls and untreated surfaces. The Butcher Social Club \u2013 another outpost of the outlet also found at the W \u2013 is open early to late during the week and around the clock on weekends for everything from breakfast to beer/booze and burgers.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac125, room only\n\nsirhotels.com\n\nA few minutes' down the street from the venerable Amstel Hotel, Hyatt Regency Amsterdam opened in 2017 on the site of a former children's hospital. You can spot a few pieces of the original facade, but everything else about the 211-room hotel is brand new.\n\nIf the Regency branch of the Hyatt chain sets an expectation of non-descript corporate design, be ready to be pleasantly surprised: light and airy interiors draw on the hotel's location in the Plantage (Plantation) neighbourhood, with living walls and hanging plants in the lobby and beautiful botanical drawings in the bedrooms. Mama Makan on the ground floor serves Indonesian food; the latter is can be found throughout the city and is a must-sample on any trip to Amsterdam.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac240, B&B\n\namsterdam.regency.hyatt.com\n\nThose looking for all-out luxury while in the Dutch capital have more choice too these days. Conservatorium, part of The Set Hotels (with Caf\u00e9 Royal in London and the Lutetia in Paris), brings a lot to the table in this bracket.\n\nFacing Museumplein, its late 19th century building housed \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 a conservatorium, before designer Piero Lissoni turned it into this striking 129-room hotel in 2008. Even if you're not staying here it's worth walking in to see the merging of old and new in the multi-storey smoked-glass addition built into the courtyard. Rooms dressed in neutral colours have varying layouts and include duplex options; suites offer roof terraces, while a penthouse wing option cobbles together an entire floor with seven bedrooms. Like its siblings, Conservatorium hides an Akasha Holistic Wellbeing Centre underneath the hotel, complete with pool and treatment rooms.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac609, B&B\n\nconservatoriumhotel.com\n\nA few minutes' walk east of Centraal Station, Grand Hotel Amr\u00e2th occupies the former Scheepvaarthuis, a listed building and example of Amsterdam School architecture. This is where a century ago sea journeys to places like New York, Cape Town, and Indonesia were sold; you can still see the ticket windows in the marble hall.\n\nRooms have a vintage feel with striped carpets, patterned wallpaper and soaring ceilings. Some of the suites are in the directors\u2019 rooms of the shipping companies that commissioned the building and feature coffered ceilings and wood panelling. There is a spa with pool, sauna and steam rooms as well.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac250, B&B\n\namrathamsterdam.com\n\nThere are almost no hotel conversion opportunities left inside Amsterdam's canal belt, but Waldorf Astoria managed to grab one: you'll find its 93 rooms and suites inside six gorgeous historic buildings on Herengracht. A highlight is the stunning grand staircase just after reception; choose a loft room under the eaves for the traditional exposed beams.\n\nFoodies will feel at home here: the hotel has both Goldfinch Brasserie and two-Michelin starred Spectrum, little sister (zusje) to three-Michelin starred De Librije, one of the most famous restaurants in the country. There is also a private garden and a Guerlain spa.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac650, room only\n\nwaldorfastoria3.hilton.com/amsterdam\n\nOpen since January 2018, Pestana Amsterdam Riverside is yet another example of a historic building getting a new lease of life. In this case, the former townhall of Nieuwer-Amstel and city archive of Amsterdam.\n\nThere are 154 contemporary rooms and suites dressed in whites and greys with glass-enclosed or semi-open bathrooms. A number of apartments come with kitchenettes for longer stays, while the Clock Tower Suite gives you river views and exposed pillars and beams inside the Neo-Renaissance townhall facing the Amstel. Restaurant ARC. is run by Peter Lute, a well-known local chef, and there is a spa with pool.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac245, B&B\n\npestana.com/en/hotel/pestana-amsterdam-riverside\n\nThis article has been updated.
