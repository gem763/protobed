However, the idea of an all-Ireland agrifood zone of regulatory alignment as part of the solution was discussed on Tuesday by Johnson and Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, as long as it did not extend to an all-Ireland customs area with a tariff border in the Irish Sea.\n\nThe idea would not be enough to satisfy Brussels that the backstop is no longer necessary, but the discussions were taken as a sign that Johnson is more focused than ever on finding solutions to the Irish border problem.\n\nA No 10 spokesman said Johnson rejected the idea of an alliance with Farage, saying he \u201chas been clear \u2013 no pact\u201d.\n\nIt comes as the Sun reported that Johnson recently claimed to anti-no-deal Tory rebels that ultimately the hardline Eurosceptic Conservatives would be the ones putting \u201cspears in my back\u201d when they realise he is prepared to make a compromise on a deal.\n\nThe prime minister also told cabinet he was fundamentally liberal and should be regarded as a \u201cBrexity Hezza\u201d\u2013 a reference to the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine.\n\nWant to stop Johnson?

Johnson would also have to sign up unequivocally to a no-deal departure.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Brexit party wraparound in the Daily Express.\n\nHe challenged Johnson: \u201cIf you have the courage for a clean-break Brexit, then we will help you secure a big Brexit majority. Together we can destroy Corbyn\u2019s Labour\u201d.\n\nFarage\u2019s high-profile adverts appear designed to publicise his harder Brexit position than Johnson in the months before a possible election, with little chance that the prime minister could accept such a high price for a pact.\n\nHowever, most recent polling suggests the Conservatives would be short of a majority with Farage\u2019s Brexit party eating into his vote and the possibility of pro-referendum parties \u2013 Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and others \u2013 potentially able to cobble together a majority for a remain alliance.", "description": "Proposal includes giving Brexit party and Conservatives a free run in 80-90 constituencies", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Zoe Williams", "Matthew Patten"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49863d285cb10bb152f2251de01ee240515d99be/0_776_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ed18a91a29eae5d8694ee23c42d8f887", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
