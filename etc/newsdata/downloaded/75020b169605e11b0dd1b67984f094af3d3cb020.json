REUTERS/Kacper Pempel\n\nPiS is expected to win more votes than it did in 2015 and may get enough parliamentary seats to continue to govern alone - but the shift in the political climate that it has presided over in the past four years has polarized the country.\n\nThe party has cast the election as a choice between a society rooted in traditional Catholic values and a liberal order that promotes a chosen few and undermines family life.\n\nOpposition parties and Poland\u2019s European Union partners say the outgoing government has undermined the independence of the judiciary and the media and made Poland less welcoming for sexual and ethnic minorities.\n\n\u201cWe can guarantee that Polish families are protected, that Poland\u2019s freedom is protected and that the Polish Church is protected against attacks,\u201d PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told supporters in its eastern rural heartland on Friday.\n\nPolls open at 0500 GMT, and surveys show PiS winning 40-46% of votes.\n\nThat may give the party an absolute majority. But it might need to form a coalition, which would raise the possibility of the far-right Confederation - one of three smaller groups that might garner the 5% of votes needed to enter parliament - becoming part of government.\n\nPolling around 19-26%, the centrist Civic Coalition - an umbrella group that includes the Civic Platform formerly led by EU Council president Donald Tusk - looks certain to continue forming the main opposition.\n\nIts candidate for prime minister, Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska, on Thursday accused Kaczynski of destroying democracy and seeking to sow further divisions.\n\n\u201cHe is building a huge wall and creating great tensions,\u201d she told supporters on Thursday. \u201cThat is why I call on all people of good will ... regardless of their political views: let\u2019s defend Poland against such ...hatred.\u201d\n\nCHURCH AND STATE\n\nOne of the foundations of the PiS\u2019 success is the way it has tapped into anger among the poorer Poles who had missed out on prosperity since the collapse of communism in 1989, mixing nationalist rhetoric with a vast welfare program that an economic boom has allowed it to implement.\n\nIt has drawn on the deeply-rooted popularity of the Catholic Church. Top PiS officials regularly attend Church events and the party has espoused stronger religious values in public life.\n\nThe Church does not openly back any party but senior officials have given the PiS tacit support.\n\nOn Oct 1, Poland\u2019s senior bishop wrote that Catholics should vote for those to defend the right to life from conception, support family values and define marriage as between man and a woman.\n\nDuring campaigning, PiS has called lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights an invasive foreign influence that threatens Poland\u2019s national identity.\n\nThe party has also shifted Poland\u2019s foreign policy away from the European mainstream, becoming a leading proponent of calls to take some powers away from the EU, with which Warsaw is embroiled in a long-running row over judicial and media reforms.\n\nBrussels has taken legal action to force Polish authorities to row back on legislation it says has politicized the courts.\n\nPiS says the reforms are needed to make the court system fairer and more efficient and plans further changes if it is re-elected.\n\n\u201cA lack of independent courts is not part of the Polish tradition,\u201d Kidawa-Blonska said on Friday.\n\nPiS has also sought closer ties with the U.S. President Donald Trump, with whom it shares views on coal mining, climate and abortion - fuelling concern among some western EU diplomats that Trump could use the biggest of the EU\u2019s ex-communist states, to sow discord in Brussels over issues such as Iran.\n\nDeeply distrustful of its former Soviet master, Poland has persuaded Trump to bolster Washington\u2019s military presence on Polish soil to counter Russia\u2019s growing assertiveness since its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nOn the economy, PiS has promised to shake off the post-communist Polish model that relied on cheap labor by more than doubling the minimum wage over 8 years.\n\nSome economists say the party\u2019s already vast social spending has exposed the economy to too much risk at the time of an economic slowdown in the West, while opposition critics say it has deprived the health care and education systems of funding.\n\nBut markets are largely sanguine about the prospect of another PiS government.", "description": "Poland holds an election on Sunday that is likely to hand the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party a second term in office, potentially deepening the country's isolation as unease within the EU about its commitment to democratic standards grows.", "authors": ["Agnieszka Barteczko", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440182921&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0NL", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
