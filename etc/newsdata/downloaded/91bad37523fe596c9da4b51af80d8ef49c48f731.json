The company had already unveiled its plans for ad-supported streaming earlier this month with the debut of two new models of its DVR, the TiVo Edge. Like The Roku Channel, TUBI, Vudu\u2019s Movies on Us, and others, TiVo Plus is available to stream for free. But unlike others in this space, TiVo Plus is available exclusively to TiVo devices owners.\n\nThe service is enabled by a TiVo partnership with XUMO, Jukin Media and other publishers.\n\nIt includes a variety of content from sources like TMZ, America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos, FilmRise, Outside TV+, PowerNation, FailArmy, Hell\u2019s Kitchen | Kitchen Nightmares, Food52, Ameba, BatteryPOP, Baeble Music, Kid Genius, Journy, NatureVision, People are Awesome, Puddle Jumper, The Asylum, The Pet Collective, The Preview Channel, Unsolved Mysteries, Adventure Sports Network, AllTime, Complex, and others.\n\nTiVo also has deals with Gannett, Loop Media, Revry, Newsy, Tastemade, Latido Music and Mobcrush to expand TiVo Plus even further.\n\nThe company says there will be \u201cthousands\u201d of movies and TV shows available in an app-free environment.\n\nDespite the obvious comparisons to The Roku Channel, the TiVo Plus interface isn\u2019t as well-designed. Where Roku puts the focus on the content that\u2019s available for free streaming, TiVo Plus highlights the publishers. The content is organized in generic and broad groupings, like \u201cMovies and TV,\u201d \u201cSports,\u201d \u201cKids and Family,\u201d \u201cEntertainment, Comedy Pop Culture,\u201d and others, instead of being more editorially curated or personalized to the viewer.\n\nThough TiVo Plus is a free service, being a TiVo owner is not. For example, the new TiVo Edge DVR for cable customers is $400, followed by a $14.99 per month service fee, which can be paid either as an annual fee ($149.99) or all at once with a lifetime plan ($549.99).\n\nThe same DVR for cord-cutters is $350 and the service fee is $6.99 per month, or $69.99 per year and $249.99 for a lifetime fee.\n\nThe DVRs include support for Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision HDR, 2TB of storage, TiVo\u2019s OnePass, SkipMode (automatic commercial skip),\n\nThis was the first time that TiVo lowered its subscriptions for the DVR for antenna users, in an effort to respond to market pressures. Most streaming media devices \u2014 like Fire TV, Roku, Apple TV, etc. \u2014 don\u2019t require subscriptions, as the companies don\u2019t license TV guide data for their users nor do they operate with cable TV-like business model involving ongoing service fees. That\u2019s allowed customers, and particularly cord-cutters, to get comfortable with one-time purchase fees and has weakened TiVo\u2019s position.\n\nWith a dwindling customer base, TiVo has turned to advertising \u2014 not only with its new ad-supported streaming service on its devices, but also with skippable pre-roll ads on DVR recordings, as recently reported and confirmed by TiVo.\n\nTiVo Plus is rolling out starting today and continuing over the next few weeks to customers with Series 6 devices with Experience 4 (TE4). It will be available on the Home screen, when it goes live.", "description": "TiVo\u2019s answer to The Roku Channel, TiVo Plus, is launching today.
