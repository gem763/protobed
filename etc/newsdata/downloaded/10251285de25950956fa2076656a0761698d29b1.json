In an average year, that\u2019s costing about $7,500 in public resources that are spent addressing that,\u201d Lamb told KOLR-TV. \u201cWe feel like having a few city staff helping spread the word with these little flags is a great way to address that.\u201d\n\nShe said pet waste can pose a danger to water quality in the area.\n\n\u201cSo just like human waste, pet waste contains bacteria and other pollutants that can be harmful to our waterways,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cYou can imagine when it rains, and we have all of this pavement, if there is pet waste on the pavement or even a small grass area, it\u2019s going to get picked up by that stormwater runoff and carried into the nearest storm drain. In the downtown area, it goes into Jordan Creek.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 A Missouri city is taking an unusual approach to the problem of un-scooped dog droppings: planting little flags next to abandoned", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
