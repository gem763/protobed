I see Kyle [Christie] every now and again but I never see Holly and we've kind of never had a conversation since we fell out big time, and I kind of wanted to smooth things over with her but never got the chance really.\"\n\nEarlier, he said of his hard-partying days: \"Even though I went and got absolutely steaming and can't remember most of the night, I don't think I got myself in too much trouble.\n\n\"I'm not watching it though, I can't watch myself.\n\n\"I'm 28 years old and I don't even like leaving people voicemails, I panic. I don't even like the sound of my own voice.", "description": "These days, the Geordie hunk is showing off a more rugged, sophisticated look than his tight T-shirt, spiked hair days", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Instagram", "Mirrorpix", "Mtv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13464692.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_James-Tindale.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
