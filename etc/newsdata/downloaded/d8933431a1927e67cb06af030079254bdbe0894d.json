The complaint avers that \u201cthe President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\u201d in particular, asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation\u201d of presidential hopeful and former vice presiden t Joe Biden Joe BidenGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE.\n\nDemocrats have lined up to laud the whistleblower\u2019s courageous act, insisting on the protection of his or her identity. Meanwhile, another famous whistleblower \u2014 who is definitely not anonymo us, and who was handled rather differently by Democrats and the mainstream left or center-left more generally \u2014 happens to have a new memoir in bookstores this month. During her presidential run, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonWarren campaign fires senior official after allegations of 'inappropriate behavior' GOP senator says he confronted Trump over Ukraine in August Whistleblowers and the hypocrisy of the ruling class MORE said that Edward Snowden should not \u201cbe brought home without facing the music.\u201d Even the more progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders released from hospital after doctors say he had heart attack Bullock pulls in .3 million in third quarter, trailing most rivals Poll: Biden holds 24-point lead over Democratic field among black voters MORE (I-Vt.) opined that Snowd en \u201cdid break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that.\u201d\n\nThe Whistleblower Protection Act should, in theory, protect heroes such as Snowden and Chelsea Manning Chelsea Elizabeth ManningWhistleblowers and the hypocrisy of the ruling class Pamela Anderson: Julian Assange has been 'psychologically tortured' in London prison WaPo announces plans to increase investigative journalism staff MORE, who have disclose d the patently illegal actions of the U.S. government. But there is policy as enact ed, and then there is policy as practiced.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMembers of the national security, intellige nce and military establishment (a nd, importantly, th eir enablers in Congress) hate nothing else quite like they hate whistleblowers, whose undaunted truth-telling shines an impertinent light on crimes untold \u2014 crimes beyond count, crimes that are indeed the subject of praise and gratitude in America.\n\nConsidered under any ordinary standard of human behavior and decency, though, the national security and intelligence community is made up of criminals of the worst kind, brutes whose whole lives are dedicated to presiding over death, destructi on an d misery.\n\nThis is perhaps the great untold truth in American public life \u2014 that what are euphemistically called \"American foreign policy\" and \"national security policy\" have been a series of misdeeds so unspeakable that we indeed do not speak of them at all.\n\nWhistleblowers dare to do so, possessed of a moral courage few of us can imagine \u2014 i ndeed, th e kind of courage we say we admire when we\u2019re talking about the military and national security communities. In the face of life-destroying consequences, they throw a spotlight on the shame of the U.S. government, not to undermine the rule of law and foment chaos, but to reveal to the public, to \u201cwe the people,\u201d the base criminality of our \u201cprotectors.\u201d\n\nWhen whistleblowers provide this public service, are top military and intelligence brass held to account? No, instea d, th ey are the subjects of solemn veneration and respect, honored with distinguished positions at elite colleges, where they have the shamelessness and the nerve to bemoan \u201cthe assault on intelligence.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBrazenly lying about the government\u2019s misdeeds, they nevertheless walk free while the Mannings and Snowdens are jailed, exiled, and damned as traitors. For example, in 2013, James Clapper James Robert ClapperWhistleblowers and the hypocrisy of the ruling class Hillicon Valley: Clapper praises whistleblower complaint | Senators urge social media giants to take action against 'deepfakes' | Tim Cook asks Supreme Court to protect DACA | Harris pushes Twitter to suspend Trump Clapper praises Trump whistleblower for 'best written' complaint he's seen MORE, at the time the director of national intelligence, famously (though apparently very much forgettably) lied under oath to the people\u2019s representatives in Congress, telling the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the National Security Agency did not gather all kinds of data from millions of unaware Americans.\n\nThis was perjury from one of the government\u2019s top intelligence and national security officials, perjury about a matter of fundamental constitutional importance, yet somehow no one seemed to care, least of all the people who ostensibly represent us and our interests.\n\nHaving ignored the ominous warnings of several post -World War II presi dents, who expressed alarm and dismay at the role of the military-industrial complex and the intelligence agencies, Americans are now governed as a practical matter by a permanent cadre of professional bureaucrats and military/intelligence officials.\n\nThis is not the far-flung conspiracy theory of radicals on the far left (people, perhaps, like the author of this piece), but the carefully considered and measured thesis of political scientists and journalists who have studied the evidence.\n\nThe U.S. government is far and away the most dangerous and destructive institutional actor on the planet. It operates hundreds of military and intelligence sites around the world ( many unacknowledged and unofficial), wages aggressive wars without congressional approval, engages in torture, and even murders its own citizens using unmanned drones operated from thousands of miles away.\n\nAs Glenn Greenwald wrote, covering the Obama administration in 2013, \u201cThe most extremist power any political leader can assert is the power to target his own citizens for execution without any charges or due process, far from any battlefield.\u201d\n\nThe worst, most toxic aspects of the military and intelligence apparatus\u2019s Orwellian (here, the cliche is entirely appropriate) war- and fear-monge ring cult ure have lately become especially fashionable with American liberals and progressives. \u201cTrump is bad, so CIA-spy cable-news talking heads and preposterous Russia conspiracy theories must be good!\u201d is about as deep as blind partisanship and a commitment to being seen as part of the \u201creasonable center\u201d will allow one to go, it seems.\n\nThis is one of the foremost problems with diehard partisanship of the Rachel Maddow Rachel Anne MaddowRachel Maddow signs onto 'Batwoman' TV series Whistleblowers and the hypocrisy of the ruling class Fox rejects Biden request to not run Trump campaign ad MORE variety: Such team loyalty, it turns out, makes it rather difficult, impossible really, to think critically (about either your side or the other) or to accurately prioritize threats.\n\nDonald Trump Donald John TrumpGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE is of almost trivial importance, and poses a trivial danger to American democracy and the rule of law, next to \u201cthe golden class of efficient guardians\u201d (borrowing Michael Glennon\u2019s phrase) who actually run the most important areas of government policy. The people holding top jobs in U.S. intelligence agenc ies, furth ermore, can be much more dangerous by orders of magnitude than any terrorist (just as police officers and prosecutors can be ord ers-of-ma gnitude more dangerous than ordinary criminals).\n\nThe moral duplicity that characterizes the role of the U.S. government in the world is among the most remarkable (if unremarked upon) features of American life. The whistleblowers who have dared to come forward and remark upon it haven\u2019t enjoyed the Trump whistleblower\u2019s warm welcome among \u201crespectable\u201d voices in politics and the media. Perhaps it\u2019s time we grapple seriously with the question of why that is.\n\nDavid S.
