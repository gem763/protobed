(AP) \u2014 A dog named Kingston is back with his family 101 days after he jumped out of their truck as they fled a devastating Northern California wildfire.\n\nThe 12-year-old Akita was reunited Monday with the Ballejos family, who fled the town of Paradise late last year, Sacramento television station KXTV reported .\n\n\u201cWhen I found out, (it) just about brought me to tears,\u201d said Gabriel Ballejos, Kingston\u2019s owner. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of him. I can\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s a true survivor, and it\u2019s a testament to the American spirit.\u201d\n\nBallejos said they never lost hope and kept posting flyers and contacting shelters.\n\n\u201cEvery night I would ask my dad and tell him that we needed to go look for him,\u201d said Ballejos\u2019 daughter, Maleah.\n\nThe family got a call after animal rescue volunteer Ben Lepe trapped Kingston on Sunday and took him to Friends of Camp Fire Cats, a local rescue group. The volunteers saw a missing dog message on Facebook and contacted the family.\n\nLepe said the large dog had been spotted on surveillance cameras and that he set up a trap big enough for it on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to check it on Sunday, there he was,\u201d Lepe said. \u201cIt was awesome to see him and know he would be fed and warm.\u201d\n\nFamily members believe Kingston survived by eating skunks, because he hunted them before the fire and smelled of skunk when they picked him up.\n\nThe town of Paradise was leveled by a Nov. 8 blaze that killed 85 people and destroyed nearly 15,000 homes in the area.\n\nAngel Herrera, of Friends of Camp Fire Cats, said the group has rescued more than 200 lost pets since the fire and still sets traps.\n\n\u201cIf we had the resources, we could trap 50 animals every single night,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: KXTV-TV.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Associated Press.
