(AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nLess than a year ago, Boston Red Sox president Dave Dombrowski was watching his team win the World Series. Now, he is no longer with the team.\n\nThe Red Sox announced Sunday they had parted ways with Dombrowski, ending the tenure of one of baseball\u2019s most respected executives in shocking fashion.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRed Sox announce they are \u201cparting ways\u201d with Dombrowski. \u2014 Jen McCaffrey (@jcmccaffrey) September 9, 2019\n\nMassLive.com\u2019s Chris Cotillo reports that general manager duties will be split between assistant general managers Eddie Romero, Brian O\u2019Halloran and Zack Scott, with a search for a full-time GM in the works.\n\nRed Sox dealing with post World-Series slump\n\nDombrowski\u2019s firing came minutes after the team finished up a 10-5 loss to the rival New York Yankees. With the loss, Boston now sits 17.5 games back from the Yankees in the AL East at 76-67.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the team\u2019s 108-win pace last year, but still decent enough that Dombrowski\u2019s firing is a stunner.\n\nOne of the reasons behind Dombrowski\u2019s firing might be the team\u2019s current financial state. The Red Sox topped all of baseball in luxury tax payroll this season and are now sitting well outside of playoff contention.\n\nThe signings of Chris Sale, David Price and Nathan Eovaldi by Dombrowski \u2014 who is well-known for splurging on free agents and trading prospects away for MLB talent \u2014 will cost the team $79 million in salary alone over the next three seasons.\n\nOf course, the Red Sox still have some major impending free agents, 2018 MVP Mookie Betts in particular. Betts told reporters after Sunday\u2019s game that the change in management mattered little to him.\n\nStory continues\n\nMookie Betts on contract talks with a new GM: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who the talks are with. It\u2019ll be the same answer. It\u2019s a business.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaid Dombrowski firing proves this is a business. \u2014 Chris Cotillo (@ChrisCotillo) September 9, 2019\n\nThe 26-year-old Betts is set to hit free agency after the 2020 season and figures to command well upwards of $200 million.\n\nRed Sox saw a lot of success with Dave Dombrowski\n\nThe Red Sox quickly scooped up Dombrowski in August 2015 after his release from the rebuilding Detroit Tigers. He quickly went to work, overseeing the team\u2019s rise from a last-place finish in 2015 to the top of the AL East in 2016.\n\nThat was the first of three straight division titles for Boston, which kept acquiring talent like Sale, Price, Craig Kimbrel and J.D. Martinez while also watching homegrown talents Mookie Betts, Xander Bogaerts and Andrew Benintendi turn into stars.\n\nAll of that culminated in one of the greatest teams in baseball history last year, winning 108 games in the regular season and running away with the World Series in five games against the Los Angeles Dodgers. You would think all of that success would buy some job security, but this is still Boston.\n\nBetween the team\u2019s current financial obligations, the need to retain its young talent and the fact that a guy who won the World Series just got canned, Dombrowski\u2019s successor will be dealing with a high-pressure situation from Day 1.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Assistant general manager Eddie Romero will take over for the Red Sox.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VeMhcf9xjG.H6b6_66rvbw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uCeKtcg33WpRBMznSw3Pbg--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d3138cc0-d2b8-11e9-afff-966d6ad3b078", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
