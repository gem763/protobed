Liverpool can handle the pressure\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThere is a conviction about Liverpool that goes far beyond this result against a vibrant and committed Spurs.\n\nThis season, nothing seems to rattle them, not going a goal down within the first minute, not the opposition being this dangerous on the break and creating some clear cut chances to place the game beyond them.\n\nNot even spurning five chances in the space of four first half minutes seemed to break their concentration or determination.\n\nThey can handle even the worst of scenarios it seems, and keep playing, keep pressing and keep believing.\n\nThat is perhaps the most important quality of all in any side which has title pretensions.\n\n2. Different Spurs on show - but why?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSo much has been said about Spurs this season, and just how poor they have been, but this performance was the old Tottenham, the team that belies the critics and defies the odds against them when they take on richer, bigger spending rivals.\n\nThe side which turned up here at Anfield could give anyone a game.\n\nThe question is, why does that team not turn up every week these days?\n\nThe answer may be simple. This is the biggest stage, with the world watching, and there are TOO many of their players looking to leave.\n\nThey will inevitably raise their game for these, to increase their profile.\n\nMaybe Tottenham have made a mistake in letting too many top players get to the end of their contracts.\n\n3. Gazzaniga shows his credentials\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLiverpool fans have a thing about reserve keepers spoiling the Anfield party.\n\nThere was a time during the middle of this decade when it seemed the Reds would be denied every other week by a surprise choice in the opposition goal stepping up and having a blinder.\n\nSo it was no surprise to see Paulo Gazzaniga do the same here, as Hugo Lloris\u2019s replacement.\n\nHe was outstanding, the first half double save from Salah and then Firmino simply brilliant, and he maintained that resistance in the face of an onslaught.\n\nGiven Lloris\u2019s struggles this season, he may fear a return when he recovers from the shoulder injury keeping him out may not be completely automatic.\n\n4, Henderson answers his critics\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nWhichever way you look at it, Jordan Henderson has struggled a little in recent weeks, and his the problem seems to be that sides are now so wary of Liverpool, they play incredibly deep.\n\nEven the likes of Spurs and United have played with nine behind the ball, and that doesn\u2019t help the skipper, because his more advanced midfield role these days means his running ability and aggression is smothered.\n\nSo his delight on scoring just after half time was understandable.\n\nIt answered some of the criticism aimed his way, criticism that rears its head far too quickly for one of the club\u2019s great servants.\n\n5. Kane is under-rated\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThis may sound a little ridiculous\u2026but Harry Kane is still under-rated.\n\nA huge talent obviously, and yeah, he get recognition enough for that.\n\nBut he\u2019s still 26, and is now the third highest goalscorer in Tottenham\u2019s history.\n\nConsider that his breakthrough season wasn\u2019t until 2014-15, so in five and a bit seasons, he\u2019s third in the club\u2019s history.\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable. Even more remarkably, he\u2019s now only 92 goals behind Jimmy Greaves.\n\nHe deserves to be talked about in the same terms as the all time great, because his record suggests he too is in that bracket.", "description": "Goals from Jordan Henderson and a Mohamed Salah penalty cancelled out Harry Kane's first-half header", "authors": ["David Maddock", "Image", "Offside Via Getty Images", "Pa", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20737696.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Premier-League-Anfield.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
