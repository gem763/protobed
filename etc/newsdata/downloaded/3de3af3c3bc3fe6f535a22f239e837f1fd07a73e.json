During early Asian hours on Tuesday, the international oil marker crude hit an intraday high above $63.00 and swiftly dropped to $62.70 by the time of writing. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - shows similar momentum: WTI retreated from $58.40 to $58.00.\n\nA decision to replace Khalid Al-Falih, one of the oil industry\u2019s most powerful figures, may produce a long-lasting ripple effect on the industry, where the personality of now the former Saudi energy ministry and his personal connections played a vital role in reaching the agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries on limiting supplies.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the son of Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman will take the position. Notably, this decision breaks a tradition that royal family members are not appointed to the position.\n\nWhile the experts believe that the reshuffle will not lead to a major change in Saudi energy policy. However, the new minister may be more vigilant to promote measures focused on oil price growth. Anyway, the oil markets will watch Abdulaziz steps closely. The new Energy Ministry will speak at the World Energy Congress that will take place later this week in Abu Dhabi.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Helen Rush covering: Brent Oil Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
