Davies suffered the injury in the Six Nations champions' third pool match against Fiji but had recovered sufficiently to be named in Warren Gatland's team on Friday. The British and Irish Lions back aggravated the injury in the Captain's Run training session on Saturday. Owen Watkin has been promoted from the bench to replace Davies in midfield with Leigh Halfpenny added to the replacements to cover the outside backs.
