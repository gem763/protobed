By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign asked the TV heavyweights if a Biden campaign surrogate could get equal time if Giuliani continued to be booked.\n\n\u201cVice President Biden and his campaign are the targets of these attacks. Saying simply that you will put a Democrat on, at a time when there are many declared candidates for the Democratic nomination for the presidency, is neither fair treatment nor equal treatment,\u201d the campaign operatives argued.\n\nThe former mayor made the rounds Sunday morning, appearing on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d and Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.\u201d\n\nDuring those appearances he continued to suggest that Joe and Hunter Biden were up to no good in their dealings with Ukraine.\n\nHe also spouted that Hunter Biden\u2019s business with China was also corrupt.\n\nNone of these accusations are founded in fact.\n\nBut the Ukrainian narrative is central to the controversy that sparked the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry \u2014 that President Trump asked the new Ukrainian president to link up with Giuliani to look into the Bidens.\n\nThis report originally appeared on NYPost.com.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign is asking top network execs to please stop booking President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.", "authors": ["Nikki Schwab"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GI433_giulia_ZG_20180502231027.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
