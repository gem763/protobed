However, Haddish says this isn\u2019t a children\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cThe show is not for kids,\u201d Haddish told reporters of the Television Critics Association in August. \u201cThe show is for adults and happens to have children on it.\u201d\n\nBefore Haddish, Art Linkletter and Bill Cosby hosted versions of Kids Say the Darndest Things in which they interviewed children. Haddish\u2019s comedy usually is raunchier than Cosby or Linkletter\u2019s, but she says Kids fits in with her advocacy for foster care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an advocate for children, and this is right on brand for me,\u201d Haddish said.\n\nIn her book, The Last Black Unicorn, Haddish writes about spending time in foster care after her biological mother had an automobile accident.\n\n\u201cI always felt like I\u2019m on an adventure,\u201d Haddish said. \u201cI was moving from house to house. I was living with strangers and I looked at it as an adventure. I kind of hated it, too, but [I thought], \u2018This is making me stronger.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Haddish believes what children have to say is important. She hopes adults will listen to the children on her show.\n\n\u201cBeing in the foster care system and knowing what it\u2019s like to not be heard, now that I am an adult, I really feel that it\u2019s very important to hear children, to listen to them, to give them a place to talk,\u201d Haddish said. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to talk, you should be heard, period, no matter what you are.\u201d\n\nHer sensitivity to children\u2019s issues serves Haddish well when she is interviewing youngsters on camera. She will ask kids to explain the rules of sports, how to use technology and even solicit dating advice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy for me to deal with kids because I talk to them like they\u2019re me, like a regular person, like how I would want somebody to talk to me,\u201d Haddish said. \u201cAnd they relax instantly and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh cool, she\u2019s not mean, she\u2019s not bossy. She cares.\u2019\u201d\n\nHaddish said she does not have to say a lot to get the kids talking.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite things in the world is to just sit and talk to kids,\u201d Haddish said. \u201cI ask maybe two questions, and then they just go. You learn so much from them.\u201d\n\nEven though she is a grownup, Haddish remembers saying the darndest things herself when she was six, seven or eight years old. She said she wanted to be a horse farmer or work in a Snickers or beef jerky factory.\n\nEverybody would be like, \u2018Why would you want to do those things?\u2019\u201d Haddish recalled. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Because my grandma said, \u2018Do what you love\u2019 and I love horses. I love Snickers. I love beef jerky.\u201d\n\nLinkletter was before Haddish\u2019s time, but when she signed to host Kids Say the Darndest Things, she did watch old footage of him.\n\n\u201cI definitely studied him. I loved all the different things that he did,\u201d Haddish said. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying comedy, though, since I was a little girl. I used to watch Red Skelton and Milton Berle and old vaudeville stuff. So that\u2019s probably why I am the way I am.\u201d\n\nThe Cosby iteration aired when Haddish was old enough to watch. She kept the live studio audience interview portions of Kids Say. In the new ABC version, Haddish also performs sketches with the kids.\n\n\u201cWe did a thing where I broke up with my boyfriend, and he kept calling on the phone,\u201d Haddish said. \u201cI got this little girl, she\u2019s talking to him for me, and we\u2019re going back and forth. Then I started crying, and she\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s going to be OK. Don\u2019t worry.\u2019 I don\u2019t even know her. We just met and she was taking care of me.\u201d\n\nKids Say the Darndest Things is only one of many items on Haddish\u2019s plate. She has the films Bad Trip and Like a Boss coming out. Her Netflix series Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready may get a second season and she has a stand-up special coming to Netflix.\n\nShe will co-star in the upcoming series Madam C.J. Walker, and TBS has renewed The Last O.G. or a third season. Haddish is happy to be busy, but also selective.\n\n\u201c[I\u2019m] way more guarded about my time and making sure whatever I\u2019m doing with my time is something that edifies me and others around,\u201d Haddish said.\n\nKids Say the Darndest Things airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EDT on ABC.", "description": "LOS ANGELES, Oct. 5 (UPI) \u2014 Tiffany Haddish usually is the source of laughs when she performs standup comedy or stars in movies like Girls Trip and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
