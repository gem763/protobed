Council finally see what\u2019s right in front of its face?", "language": "en", "text": "\u25cfThe Metro board, where Evans served as chairman, found he had failed to disclose a conflict of interest with a company that was secretly paying him $50,000 a year. Evans resigned in disgrace.\n\n\u25cfEvans is the target of a federal grand jury investigation. Prosecutors have subpoenaed records from the D.C. government involving him and his business clients; the FBI has searched his home.\n\nHis shenanigans at Metro, where he was accused of \u201cknowingly\u201d and repeatedly abusing his position to help friends and private clients, were so embarrassing that the hear-no-evil, see-no-evil council was forced to act. It did as little as possible by handing down a reprimand \u2014 based on a Post article \u2014 and he was subsequently stripped of his finance committee chairmanship.\n\nFinally, over the summer, gleaning that the council\u2019s credibility was at stake, Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) convinced his colleagues to adopt a resolution authorizing an investigation into Evans\u2019s conduct.\n\nBut in keeping with the council\u2019s tradition of letting colleagues vote on their own disciplinary crackdowns, Mendelson gave Evans a chance show how he felt about being investigated. Evans thought it was a bad idea and voted \u201cno.\u201d\n\nCraig Holman of the watchdog group Public Citizen, according to The Post, has proposed that the council change legislative rules to prohibit lawmakers from voting on any matter \u201cthat directly and substantially affects the member.\u201d\n\nThat eminently sensible notion, however, runs smack dab into the Mr. Magoo-like quality actualized in the council \u2014 a nearsighted legislative body that stubbornly refuses to admit problems from within. Said Mendelson of Holman\u2019s suggestions that Evans ought to recuse himself: \u201cThe fact is, he\u2019s a member, so he gets to vote.\u201d\n\nWith that, the council adopted a July 9 resolution authorizing a narrowly focused investigation with no set deadline.\n\nThe resolution calls for an investigation into the official and outside activities of Evans from the period Jan. 1, 2014, to the present related to his private firm, NSE Consulting LLC, any NSE client or any other private entity by which Evans was employed or for which he consulted. The council wants the inquiry to determine whether Evans violated the city\u2019s code of conduct for public officials or D.C. Council rules relating to conflicts of interest, outside activities, the use of government resources or use of confidential information.\n\nRather than relying upon the independent D.C. inspector general, D.C. attorney general or Board of Ethics and Government Accountability, Mendelson elected to hire top-rated private law firm O\u2019Melveny and Myers to conduct the probe for \u201cfees not to exceed $250,000.\u201d\n\nMendelson certainly chose a firm known for representing clients with high profiles.\n\nIn the class-action fraud case brought by former Trump University students against Donald Trump and Trump University, Trump was defended by O\u2019Melveny and Myers.\n\nLawyers at the firm helped the Trump transition team\u2019s vetting process.\n\nAn O\u2019Melveny and Myers partner represents Trump\u2019s inaugural committee as it faces legal questions from federal prosecutors.\n\nO\u2019Melveny and Myers also represented Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, who faced scrutiny over investments he held on to after entering government service.\n\nIn July, Mendelson said he expected the O\u2019Melveny investigation to get wrapped around the time the council returned from its summer vacation.\n\nThe council is back, the days of September are dwindling, and the report is, thus far, a no-show.\n\nThis week, Mendelson disclosed in a news briefing that the probe has been delayed because key witnesses have refused to speak to O\u2019Melveny and Myers investigators or comply with subpoenas issued by the firm. They \u201care not coming in to be interviewed\u201d complained Mendelson. Oh, boohoo.\n\nNow the council, at Mendelson\u2019s urging, has voted to give the city the authority to ask the D.C. Superior Court to enforce the subpoenas. (Once again, Evans voted \u201cno.\u201d )\n\nThe new due date for the public to get a peek at O\u2019Melveny and Myers\u2019s probe is mid-October, Mendelson said.\n\nBy then, maybe the D.C. Council will finally be able to see what\u2019s right in front of its face.\n\nRead more from Colbert King\u2019s archive.\n\nRead more:\n\nColbert I. King: Do District voters care about D.C.
