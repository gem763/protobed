Brown reportedly sent intimidating text messages to an alleged victim within a group chat after she spoke with Sports Illustrated earlier in the month about her accusation.\n\nBrown followed up his first tweet by bringing up a series of other high-profile misconduct investigations in recent NFL history, including some that touched his former teams, the Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nKraft got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/eKrAE0Vwih \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\nShannon Sharp the funny guy on tv \ud83d\udcfa still after this pic.twitter.com/ZlVvvOqKWg \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\n4 games for Big Ben crazy world I\u2019m done with it pic.twitter.com/ZXVZXzM4xh \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\nBrown started the calendar year as a Steeler, got himself traded to the Oakland Raiders in March, wore out his welcome as he battled the NFL over the model of helmet he was allowed to wear and then became upset with the Raiders over fines imposed on him for missing camp.\n\nIn an Instagram post, the star receiver dared the Raiders to release him (or begged, depending on your interpretation) and the team granted him his wish. By day\u2019s end he had agreed to terms with New England \u2014 but all this was before the first allegation of sexual assault, within a civil lawsuit, was made public.\n\nBrown has threatened to retire before. He told ESPN reporter Jeff Darlington before the Steelers traded him that \u201cI don\u2019t even have to play football if I don\u2019t want,\u201d and during the helmet saga he threatened to quit the league if he didn\u2019t get his way.\n\nBrown\u2019s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said Saturday that he had gotten interest from a few teams who wanted details of the NFL\u2019s investigation into Brown\u2019s misconduct allegations. But perhaps this is the last we\u2019ve seen of the man who once was the best wide receiver in football.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
