(Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Supreme Court takes on one of its most consequential issues of the term Tuesday, considering whether federal discrimination laws protect gay and transgender workers.\n\nThe issue for the court is the reach of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, besides protecting against workplace discrimination because of race, religion and other characteristics, also prohibits discrimination \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d\n\n[Supreme Court considers if gay, transgender workers covered by federal law]\n\nThe court combined two cases to consider whether gay workers are covered. Gerald Bostock claims he was fired from his job as a social worker in Clayton County, Ga., after he became more open about being gay, including joining a gay softball league. Donald Zarda said he was fired as skydiving instructor after joking with a female client to whom he was strapped for a tandem dive that he was gay. (Zarda died in 2014.)\n\nThe transgender case involves Aimee Stephens, who worked for years at a Michigan funeral home before being fired after informing the owners and colleagues of her gender transition.\n\nFor 50 years, courts read the 1964 law to mean only that women could not be treated worse than men, and vice versa, not that discrimination on the basis of sex included LGBTQ individuals. The Trump administration says that is what the Supreme Court should find as well.\n\n\u201cThe ordinary meaning of \u2018sex\u2019 is biologically male or female; it does not include sexual orientation,\u201d Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco said in a brief to the court in the Bostock and Zarda cases, which have been combined.\n\n[Politically volatile term will test Roberts, Supreme Court]\n\nEmployers violate Title VII only by treating members of one sex \u201cworse than similarly situated members of the other sex. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, standing alone, does not satisfy that standard,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe government makes similar arguments against transgender status.\n\nThat puts the Trump administration at odds with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which decided in 2015 that gay and transgender individuals were federally protected.\n\nTreating a man who is attracted to men differently from a woman who is attracted to men is discrimination, the EEOC reasoned.\n\nThe commission also looked at a 1989 Supreme Court decision that said federal law protected against discrimination based on stereotypes; the court found for a woman who had not been promoted because her employers found her too aggressive, and her manner of dress not feminine enough.\n\nThat is analogous to discriminating against a transgender individual, the commission said. And discrimination because of sexual orientation is the same thing, the EEOC said, because it relies on stereotypes about to whom men and women should be attracted.\n\nGay rights leaders say \u201cmarried on Sunday, fired on Monday\u201d is a possibility in more than half of the United States, where there is no specific protection for gay or transgender workers. The states that prohibit discrimination are not uniform \u2014 some protect only gender identity or transgender status, and some differentiate between public and private employment.\n\nThe sexual orientation cases are Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga. and Altitude Express v. Zarda. The other case is R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v.
