The bill, which aims to \u201csupport the democratic aspirations of the people of Hong Kong,\u201d challenges Beijing\u2019s authority and questions the special status Hong Kong enjoys under China\u2019s \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 principle, which allows it to have a separate legal and economic system from the mainland.\n\nRead more\n\nHong Kong has been gripped with violent anti-government protests for months, which have plunged the city into chaos and hit its economy hard. While China has shown maximum restraint in dealing with the unrest, the US and some other Western countries have openly voiced support for the protests, triggering outrage in Beijing. China has reacted fiercely to any meddling in its domestic affairs, saying that it will not tolerate the \u201cinterference of external forces.\u201d\n\nIf the US legislation gets further approval and is signed off by President Trump, it will require verification of Hong Kong\u2019s special status as a separate legal and economic system from mainland China. It will enable the US to sanction individuals and will also open the possibility of export controls.\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump may hold his signature as a possible leverage for further trade negotiations with China,\u201d Peter C. Earle, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research, told RT.\n\nHe noted that the bill is based on Washington\u2019s assertion that Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy is \u201ca sham\u201d and, therefore, the US should not treat it separately from China.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether \u2018One Country Two Systems\u2019 has become a sham. The answer is, clearly not,\u201d Earle stressed. He explained that, apart from its separate status under the WTO, Hong Kong has been recently recognized as one of the freest economies in the world, according to recent annual assessments from the Fraser Institute of Canada and the US-based Cato Institute.\n\nDespite Beijing\u2019s fierce reaction to any attempts to influence the situation in Hong Kong, the new legislation is not the worst thing that Washington has done to provoke its trade war rival, according to Sourabh Gupta, senior fellow at the Institute for China-America Studies. Thus, the issue is not going to derail the trade talks.\n\nAlso on rt.com JP Morgan makes it clear to staff that Taiwan & Hong Kong are part of China\n\n\u201cYou know, there has been far worse that the US has done with regard to Chinese interests during the course of these negotiations. I\u2019m talking specifically with regard to these huge weapons sales which has been okayed for Taiwan,\u201d he said, adding that the two sides are poised to continue the negotiations anyway.\n\n\u201cObviously the US and China are negotiating their trade agreement, which is a separate issue,\u201d Gupta stressed. \u201cHong Kong itself is a special administrative region with full autonomy over its economic arrangements and, therefore, if Hong Kong were to have some sort of economic arrangement with the US, Beijing won\u2019t necessarily oppose that.\u201d\n\nFor more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section", "description": "As Washington and Beijing continue to try to settle their differences over trade and to reach a partial agreement at least on that issue, recent US legislation on Hong Kong is likely to further anger China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db6e37885f540334d7d3e86.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
