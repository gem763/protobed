While they promise to use natural ingredients such as caffeine, collagen or peppermint to stimulate blood flow or cause irritation minor enough to plump your lips, it\u2019s tricky to formulate a product that will work for all, or that won\u2019t go a step too far and cause an all out allergic reaction.\n\nTo find the best solution to lacklustre lips, we sought effects as close to natural-looking lip fillers as possible. We put glosses, balms and lipsticks alike to the test to see just how much volume we could gain without facing the needle.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for products that will actually add moisture, definition and fullness to your lips, here are the top non-surgical options to boost your pout.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

It definitely provides the most extreme sensation of all the products tested \u2014 lips tingle and heat up for nearly twenty minutes \u2014 and gives the quickest results. However, what really sets this product apart is its long-term benefits. Determined to one-up their already infamous lip injection gloss, the extreme edition of Too Faced\u2019s latest cult product claims to gradually make lips bigger over time. After just one week of daily use, our tester found that her lips held the plumping effect even when the gloss was wiped off to apply lipstick.\n\nBuy now\n\nFenty Beauty gloss bomb lip luminiser: \u00a316, Harvey Nichols\n\nStrictly speaking, this isn\u2019t a lip plumper. On a mission to create the \u201cperfect gloss,'' Fenty promises to condition your way to plumper lips. We love the peach scent and how easy it is to layer this gloss. Unlike a lot of lip products, gloss bomb manages to withstand talking, eating and drinking, leaving you with Rihanna-approved lips all day long. Another surprising bonus is its pigmentation. Gloss bomb is a self-proclaimed \u201cuniversal nude\u201d which doesn\u2019t wash out any skin tone, but if you\u2019re looking for other options, they now offer two additional shades \u2013 fu$$y (a pale pink) and diamond milk (a shimmering pearl).\n\nBuy now\n\nDr Dennis Gross Skincare hyaluronic marine collagen lip cushion: \u00a332, Cult Beauty\n\nA lot of lip plumpers are about instant gratification, but Dr Dennis Gross Skincare is formulated by the dermatologic surgeon of the same name \u2013 in short, its products are in it for the long haul. This plumper looks and feels like a regular lip balm, but is packed with marine algae, hyaluronic acid and antioxidants. Combined, these ingredients define the outline of your lips and revive their natural hue. Over the course of a few weeks, our looks looked much healthier and substantially fuller. Those who prefer a matte look will also appreciate how well this sits beneath lipstick, thanks to its lack of a glossy finish.\n\nBuy now\n\nSoap and Glory sexy mother pucker pillow plump XXL: \u00a312.90, Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019re a long-term fan of lip plumpers, odds are this was your first purchase. Soap and Glory\u2019s sexy mother pucker is a cult classic, pairing a hardcore stinging sensation with equally potent results \u2013 lips look beestung and full for hours after use. While this means you don\u2019t need to reapply too often, it does leave quite a sticky residue on your lips, so doesn\u2019t pair well over lipstick. However, it is available in a range of pigmented options if you prefer some colour on your pout.\n\nBuy now\n\nDior Addict lip maximiser: \u00a328, Debenhams\n\nAs luxurious a product as the brand name suggests, this is another collagen-based lip maximiser that promises to smooth and moisturise your pout. The effects are noticeable immediately, with only a gentle tingling sensation that is more refreshing than painful. It wears well throughout the day, but our tester found the vanilla scent so addictive that she applied it multiple times anyway. However, despite promising to firm the lips over time, we found that there was no lasting difference after 14 days of use.\n\nBuy now\n\nAlgenist genius liquid collagen lip: \u00a336, Cult Beauty\n\nAlgae is packed with nutrients, harnessed by Algenist to create some of the most transformative products out there. Together with collagen, both ingredients fill out your pout and reduce the appearance of fine lines or wrinkles around the lip line. The consistency is unusual at first, feeling lumpy due to the small beads of microalgae, but once they\u2019re absorbed lips feel deeply hydrated and smooth.\n\nBuy now\n\nFillerina lip volume treatment dosage 2: \u00a350, Feel Unique\n\nAs the first dermo cosmetic filler designed for home use, this felt the closest to an actual surgical treatment. Despite its clinical-looking packaging and usage directions, it applies like any lip balm. Available in a range of strengths, our tester opted for dosage 2 which promises to increase lip volume thanks to six different hyaluronic acid molecules. Our tester was surprised by how effective this formula was \u2014 it may not return immediate results, but after the recommended five daily applications across two weeks, lips felt plumper and smoother. It might boast a hefty price tag, but if you\u2019re looking for long-term improvement, this could be the one for you.\n\nBuy now\n\nYves Saint Laurent volupte plump-in-colour: \u00a329, YSL Beauty\n\nCombining the pigment of a lipstick with the plumping effects of a gloss, this product looks and feels luxurious. Its coconut and pomegranate oil formula boosts hydration, while its use of peppermint and glycols (sneakily hidden inside the black heart on the tip of the lipstick) increases circulation, hence the plumping effect. Although it doesn\u2019t have as extreme an effect as its competitors, it wins points for versatility, eliminating the need for a pigmented product alongside a plumper. We loved how subtle the plumping was and while it\u2019s available in eight shades, our favourite was lunatic red.\n\nBuy now\n\nCharlotte Tilbury collagen lip bath: \u00a325, John Lewis & Partners\n\nPromisingly, this lip plumper contains collagen, best known as the chemical filler of choice for cosmetic surgeons across the world. While the effects aren\u2019t quite as extreme as you\u2019d get at the hands of said surgeon, the peppermint and coconut oil formula gives your lips a moisturised, nude glow that has the added bonus of making your lips feel truly nourished after use. This formula can be used as a replacement for lip balm, but also sits perfectly over lipstick to give your makeup some extra definition. It comes out on top for longevity and those with dry or chapped lips will love this product.\n\nBuy now\n\nRodial dragon\u2019s blood XXL lip plumper: \u00a323, Space NK\n\nIf we were judging on the name of products alone, this would be our winner. Thankfully, the formula lives up to the name. While it feels quite thick on application, it translates to heavy moisturisation and left our tester\u2019s lips hydrated all day long. Unlike a lot of plumpers, there\u2019s no tingling sensation and we suspect that most of the plumping effect comes from the improved health of your lips. This is an ideal choice for colder weather, when chapped lips can come across thin or pale.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Lip plumpers\n\nToo Faced\u2019s lip injection extreme lives up to its name as the most effective, fast-acting plumper on this list. However, if you\u2019re looking to improve the health and hydration of your lips in the long term, we love Dr Dennis Gross Skincare\u2019s hyaluronic marine collagen lip cushion.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
