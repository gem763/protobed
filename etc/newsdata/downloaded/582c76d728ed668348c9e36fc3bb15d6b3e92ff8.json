It hit as low as $1.2850 in Asian trading before settling around $1.2920 <GBP=D3> in London, down 0.5% on the day.\n\nGoldman Sachs raised the probability of the United Kingdom leaving with a ratified deal to 70% from 65%, cut its view of the chances of a \"no-deal\" Brexit to 5% from 10% and left its view on no Brexit at all unchanged at 25%.\n\n\n\n\n\nBREXIT DELAY?\n\nThe EU, which has grappled with the tortuous Brexit crisis since Britons voted 52%-48% to leave in a 2016 referendum, decided on Sunday to play for time rather than rush to decide on Johnson's request.\n\nFrom the EU's point of view, extension options range from just an additional month until the end of November to half a year or longer.\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigners said they would ask a Scottish court on Monday to delay its ruling on a legal challenge that sought to force Johnson to comply with a law requiring him to request a delay to Brexit in the event that no agreement had been approved.\n\nEU Council President Donald Tusk has said he has received Johnson's unsigned request and is consulting with EU leaders on how to react.\n\nIn London, Johnson's ministers said they were confident they had the numbers to push a deal through parliament where opponents were plotting to derail the deal he had assured the EU that he could ratify.\n\nBut the opposition Labour Party is planning changes to the legislation needed for Brexit that would make the deal unacceptable to swathes of Johnson's own party including a proposals for another referendum.\n\nJohnson's former allies, the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said they would not back a proposal for a customs union with the EU - a step that, if passed, would doom Johnson's deal.\n\n\"We are clear where we stand on the customs union as something that we cannot support and will not support, and I believe that that will be the stance we will have later on when we see the wording,\" DUP lawmaker Jim Shannon said.\n\nIf Johnson's deal is scuppered just days before the United Kingdom's planned departure, it would leave Johnson a choice: try to leave without a deal or accept a delay.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Toby Chopra and Angus MacSwan)", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will again try to put his Brexit deal to a vote in parliament on Monday after he was forced by his opponents to send a letter seeking a delay from the European Union.
