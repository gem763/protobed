Because quiet frankly with Senator Dole's praising of me I think I chocked on my ego back there,' he said to boisterous laughter.\n\nThroughout his speech he recounted how his involvement with the Hidden Heroes campaign began, but a palpable shift could be seen in the room as Hanks turned his attention to Obama.\n\nPictured: Obama giving her acceptance speech that honored service members and caregivers at the Hidden Heroes gala\n\nWhen introducing Obama, Hank recalled how she was chosen for such an award.\n\n'Well,' he said, 'we wanted to recognize someone who was there for our caregivers in the early days. A national leader who understood and took hold of the issue before most.'\n\n'When the foundation thought who that leader might be, the choice was obvious and immediate.'\n\nAs Obama graced the stage, the room stands to applaud and listens to her speech with a griped attention.\n\n'It's been so meaningful to partner with this foundation on issues that we're all so passionate about,' Obama said.\n\n'To be honored in this community of caregivers, veterans and their families is truly overwhelming.'\n\nObama: 'You all have changed me forever. You've changed the way I see service. The way I see war. You've changed the way I see this entire country'\n\nCaregiver Facts RAND reports the following: There are 5.5 million caregivers in the United States\n\n17 percent of civilian caregivers spend 40 hours per week providing care\n\n8 percent spends more than 80 hours per week\n\nMilitary caregivers experience worse health outcomes, family strains and workplace problems\n\nFor 9/11 caregivers, there duties are estimated to cost $3 billion as of 2011\n\nDuring her speech, Obama showed a moment of self awareness and praised service members' dedication to the country.\n\nShe said: 'But I also feel empowered because I know everything I've done on this issue pales in comparison to literally every single service member, every caregiver, every veteran, every military spouse and child I have ever met.'\n\n'Yeah, I'm giving speeches, but I'm not managing a household all alone while my loved one is serving overseas.'\n\nIn an emotional moment, Obama's fervor seeps through and she fights back tears as she thanks members of the military.\n\n'You all have changed me forever. You've changed the way I see service. The way I see war. You've changed the way I see this entire country.'\n\nShe recalls being able to sit down with military spouses while Barack Obama was campaigning for his first election and heard stories 'that blew [her] away.'\n\n'I learned about the strains on family's created by the unseen wounds of war.'\n\nShe ended her speech with the words: 'We see you.'\n\nObama shared her admiration for military caregivers and thank the Dole Foundation for their valuable work in a tweet (pictured)\n\n'Because your power is not that you just adjust to the new normal. You thrive in it. You all are an inspiration.'\n\n'My message to you is this: We see you...and in all of my work all I've tried to do is that I see you and my husband sees you. And millions of Americans see you. We know you're unsung heroes and we care.'\n\nEarlier in the night, Hanks described Dole's creation of Hidden Heroes and Obama's entry into the campaign.\n\n'Fortunately, and finally, Senator Dole saw them and sounded the alarm,' he said.\n\n'And when she did another national leader was listening. Michelle Obama wanted to know how she could help.'\n\nDole and Obama held a conference in the White House with more than 70 military caregivers in attendance.\n\nFor many, it was the first first time they received national recognition for their work.\n\nTom Hanks (left) and Savannah Guthrie (right) are two ambassadors for the Hidden Heroes campaign\n\nObama reportedly said: 'When I look at you all and I see how emotional you are because you are here, because the country is recognizing what you do, I know it touches you so much.'\n\n'We know you are sacrificing so much and so much of what you do goes unnoticed.'\n\n'You are some of the most unsung heroes in the country.'\n\nToday Show host Savannah Guthrie is an ambassador for Hidden Heroes and was also in attendance last night.\n\nDuring a segment on the Today Show, Guthrie highlighted a military couple who were one of the 'hidden heroes' being honored and Obama's award.\n\nIn a tweet, Gurthrie said: 'What a night! Loved celebrating our military caregivers with [Michelle Obama], [Tom Hanks], [Rita Wilson] at the Hidden Heroes gala.'\n\nPictured: Former North Carolina Senator Elizabeth Dole (left), the founder of Hidden Heroes, and Savannah Guthrie (right) at the gala\n\nPictured: Savannah Guthrie (left) and Michelle Obama (right) attending the military gala on Wednesday nigt\n\nAccording to Guthrie, there 'wasn't a dry eye in the house' when Obama gave her speech.\n\n'Well now I'm crying all over again. There was not a dry eye in the house last night when the first lady spoke of her care for military veterans and the care givers.'\n\nDuring the gala, the Bob and Dolores Hope Foundation, a philanthropic organization, donated $1 million to a new Hidden Heroes campaign spearheaded by Tom Hanks.\n\nIt will honor caregivers who support veterans with dog tags of their own.\n\nMany caregivers, who are often family of wounded veterans, do not receive the same access to resources that other programs provide for their military relative.\n\n'Playing this role can impose a substantial physical, emotional, and financial toll on caregivers,' the RAND Corporation reports.\n\nRAND says there are an estimated 5.5 million military caregivers in the United States and of that number 1.1 million, or 19.6 percent, are caring for post-9/11 veterans.\n\n17 percent of civilian caregivers reportedly spend 40 hours per week providing care.\n\nRAND says: 'These caregivers play an essential role in caring for injured or wounded service members and veterans.'\n\nAs of 2011, post 9/11 caregiver duties cost as much as $3 billion.\n\nHidden Heroes, and other advocacy groups, are working to ensure proper resources can be provided to combat these issues.", "description": "Former first lady Michelle Obama won the Hidden Heroes Champion award at a military gala on Wednesday night and fought back tears as she thanked 'unsung' military caregivers", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/14/20133812-0-image-a-12_1571925018278.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
