REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\nBritain\u2019s fifth biggest supermarket group trades from about 840 stores and has built a grocery market share of 8.1%, but its pledge to having the lowest prices is denting profit.\n\nAldi trails Tesco (TSCO.L), Sainsbury\u2019s (SBRY.L), Asda (WMT.N) and Morrisons (MRW.L), but along with fellow German-owned discounter Lidl has been winning market share from the big four, aggressively opening new stores.\n\nIt is targeting 1,200 stores by 2025 and plans to invest 1 billion pounds in stores and distribution centres across the UK over the next two years.\n\n\u201cFor almost three decades we\u2019ve proven that investment equals growth,\u201d Aldi UK Chief Executive Giles Hurley said.\n\nBritain\u2019s food retailing sector has been transformed in the last decade by the march of Aldi and Lidl which has driven down the returns of the big four players.\n\nThey have fought back by trying to narrow the price gap, improving service and chasing greater purchasing power.\n\nLast year Tesco bought wholesaler Booker and launched its own budget chain. Sainsbury\u2019s tried and failed to take over Asda, while Morrisons has struck wholesale deals with Amazon (AMZN.O) and convenience chain McColl\u2019s (MCLSM.L).\n\n\u201cThe commitment we have made ... to continue investing in the UK over the coming years remains as strong as ever,\u201d Hurley said after Aldi UK reported an operating profit of 197.9 million pounds for the year to Dec. 31 2018.\n\nThis was down from 265.9 million pounds in 2017, although Aldi UK\u2019s sales increased 11% to 11.33 billion pounds, with customer numbers up 5% to 16.6 million.\n\nAldi\u2019s operating margin fell from 2.6% in 2017 to 1.75% in 2018, which analysts at Barclays said was the lowest since 2010.\n\n\u201cThe lower the margin goes then the sooner the point will be reached when it is harder to justify so many new store openings,\u201d the Barclays analysts said.\n\nAldi attributed the profit fall to price cuts, saying its price advantage over the big four was 24% on an average basket of everyday items. It said while its operating margin had fallen, it had improved in the current year.\n\nIn 2017 Aldi\u2019s profit had risen for the first time in four years.\n\nLONDON CALLING\n\nAldi said it would step up the pressure on rivals by increasing store numbers in London from 45 to 100 by the end of 2025, by opening more standard-sized Aldi stores and new, smaller-format \u2018Local\u2019 stores on London high streets.\n\n\u201cLondon shoppers regularly tell us they would switch to Aldi if there was one nearby, so there is clearly a significant growth opportunity for us in the capital,\u201d said Hurley, pointing out that Aldi\u2019s London market share is just 3.4%.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe firm said trials of its Local format \u2013 which measure around half the size of a typical store and stock around 1,500 products \u2013 had exceeded expectations since they began in March.\n\nAldi\u2019s update made no mention of Brexit, though the firm did point out it sources its entire core range of fresh meat, eggs, milk, butter and cream from British suppliers.\n\nBritain\u2019s other supermarkets have warned that a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 would disrupt fresh food supplies and could increase prices.", "description": "Aldi reaffirmed its commitment to investing in Britain on Monday, despite a 26% fall in 2018 profit at the German discount supermarket group's UK business as it paid the price of expansion.", "authors": ["James Davey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430382314&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0IL", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
