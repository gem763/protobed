Hello, iced coffee \u2014 it's been too long.\n\nAre you new to our newsletter? Sign up here!\n\nEarlier this week, buzzy Silicon Valley microbiome startup uBiome filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company had previously convinced VCs that testing poop was a business worth $600 million. Among them: Andreessen Horowitz and 8VC, who now own 11% and 20% of uBiome, according to the bankruptcy filing:\n\nChapter 11 bankruptcy isn't as extreme as other forms of insolvency: uBiome won't be liquidating as it would if it had declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy, for example. Instead, the company is looking for a buyer and attempting to save what it can of the business. That could be tough if uBiome's foundational science is flawed, as insiders previously told me.\n\nWhich brings me to my next bit of news: Zachary Tracer and I had the scoop on an unfortunate turnout for uBiome's plans for salvation. The company was going to try selling its only product, a test called Explorer, at CVS stores. CVS, however, told us it's not feeling the deal:\n\nProspective uBiome buyers face other risks too, as my colleague Emma Court lays out below. Among them: potentially millions of dollars in refunds from health insurers including Cigna, UnitedHealth, and Kaiser. Three of the claims exceed $1 million:\n\nuBiome first came under scrutiny after an FBI raid.

The company's top investors stand to be smiling widely as each of them could make billions from the deal, as Lydia and Emma reported on Tuesday:\n\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nDoes SmileDirect's bright news have you wondering what other lucrative startups are trying to transform the way we get care?
