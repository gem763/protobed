Mr. Trump loudly admitted it, and the summary of his July phone conversation with Mr. Zelensky and the whistle-blower report cast it in the worst possible light. If Mr. Trump\u2019s willing to cop to this, all while promoting an Infowars-level conspiracy theory to justify it, the American public can reasonably suspect that he\u2019s abusing the powers of his office in other ways to fix the election in his favor.\n\nMr. Trump has supplied American voters with overwhelming reason to doubt that any election he participates in can be fair. That\u2019s why he can\u2019t be allowed to run for any public office, much less the presidency, ever again.\n\nThe president\u2019s infamous call with Mr. Zelensky took place the day after the special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about his inquiry into the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia and Russian interference in the 2016 election. If Mr. Trump was elated that the testimony failed to unleash immediate impeachment hearings, he was also unnerved by the prospect of facing an indictment at the end of his time in office. The president knows he\u2019s beyond the reach of criminal prosecution only so long as he commands the awesome powers of the executive branch.\n\nThe content of the \u201cfavors\u201d Mr. Trump asked of the Ukrainian president underscore his feral resolve to barricade himself inside the Oval Office for at least five more years. His purpose in pressuring Mr. Zelensky to inquire into the Ukrainian whereabouts of an imaginary server and to beat the bushes for evidence of corruption involving Mr. Biden\u2019s family was to drum up \u201cevidence\u201d that Russian election interference and his role in abetting it was nothing but a frame job fabricated by Ukrainians, in cahoots with the Democratic Party, to throw the 2016 election to Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt can be hard to grasp the point of all this. The point is that Mr. Trump is a great patriot who did nothing wrong, while the Democrat he views as the biggest threat to his continuing legal immunity is an illegitimate traitor. You see, if Mr. Mueller\u2019s entire investigation was nothing but the continuation of a fabulously intricate conspiracy theory meant to undermine America\u2019s democratic sovereignty, then Mr. Trump had to obstruct it to defend the republic. If Joe Biden was centrally involved in it, then he\u2019s the corrupt threat to democracy. It\u2019s a paranoid piece of fiction that would make Thomas Pynchon, or Vladimir Putin, proud.", "description": "The president\u2019s brazen attempt at cheating has taken \u201cdecide it at the ballot box\u201d off the menu.
