Turkey has been a treaty ally of the United States since it (along with Greece) joined NATO in 1952. But, McGurk wrote, that doesn\u2019t make Turkey a reliable partner of the United States:\n\nU.S. diplomats continue to hope that by working with Turkey on Syria, they can break Ankara\u2019s drift toward authoritarianism and a foreign policy that works against U.S interests. They cannot. Turkey was a problematic ally well before any disagreement over Syria. Over the past decade, Ankara has helped Iran avoid U.S. sanctions, held U.S. citizens hostage, and used migration as a tool to blackmail Europe. More recently, it has begun to purchase Russian anti-aircraft systems over the objections of NATO and has actively supported \u2014 along with China, Iran, and Russia \u2014 President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s authoritarian regime in Venezuela.\n\nTurkey\u2019s anti-Semitic authoritarian leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan has exploited his country\u2019s ally status to shield himself from repercussions for his misbehavior. When it comes to the Middle East, Erdogan is less a partner of the U.S. than an antagonist. Expect him to continue his anti-democratic, anti-Western turn as America exits the region. Not only is Turkey preparing a ground offensive against Kurds inside Syria. In recent months Erdogan has been polishing his migration weapon, threatening to increase refugee flows to Europe if European leaders do not provide Turkey financial assistance.\n\nWhen does a misbegotten partnership endanger a nation\u2019s identification as an ally? It would be good to draw a line somewhere. Most of the debate over NATO concerns the alliance\u2019s strategic purpose and the lack of burden sharing among its members. If only more attention was paid to the fact that the alliance includes a nation-state whose leadership and interests do not align with our own.", "description": "Turkey may be our treaty ally, but that doesn't make them our partner.", "authors": ["Matthew Continetti", "Andrew C.
