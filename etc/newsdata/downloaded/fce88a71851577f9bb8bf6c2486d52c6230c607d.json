We have some shows and movies for you. (Photo: USA TODAY/Warner Bros.)\n\nThere's nothing quite like a steaming mug of coffee first thing in the morning. And your friends from your favorite movies and TV series understand this, too.\n\nSunday is National Coffee Day, and what better way to celebrate the occasion than with films and TV shows that appreciate the beverage as much as you do? We rounded up five binge-worthy choices that are caffeinated and ready to stream.\n\nCLOSE From mayors to mutants, your new fall TV and streaming obsessions are right here. USA TODAY\n\nIf you like to talk fast and drink a lot of coffee: Gilmore Girls\n\nCW's Gilmore Girls launched a thousand GIFs about the need for coffee. Lorelai and Rory Gilmore were defined more by their love for the caffeinated beverage than by their romantic adventures or junk-food bingeing. And that didn't change in the Netflix 2016 revival, A Year in the Life. The Gilmores like their coffee strong and in vast quantities, and it's a perfect companion to watching the show. Just don't try to keep up.\n\nStream the original on Netflix here and A Year in the Life here.\n\nIf your local coffeeshop is basically home: Friends\n\nSo much of the relationship drama, Chandler one-liners and group hangs that made Friends what it was happened on the Central Perk couch. While Monica, Pheobe, Rachel, Joey, Chandler and Ross aren't quite as obsessed with coffee as, say, the Gilmores, they owe a lot of the show's humor and heart to that cozy coffee shop.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\nIf you like your coffee with a side of intrigue: Twin Peaks\n\nIn the running with Lorelai and Rory for the award of \"TV Character Most in Love with Coffee\" is Agent Dale Cooper of the FBI, who comes to Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of Laura Palmer and has some \"damn fine\" cups of coffee along the way. Don't even get him started on pie.\n\nStream the original on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu or Showtime. Stream the returned series on Showtime.\n\nIf you and your coffee are fabulous: Breakfast at Tiffany's\n\nThe iconic scene from which the film gets its title finds Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) having her breakfast and coffee outside the famed jewelry store. There's a lot more to the classic film than that scene, but it's a striking cinematic moment.\n\nStream it on Amazon.\n\nIf you think coffee is an effective tool for a wingman: Am\u00e9lie\n\nAm\u00e9lie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) the bold heroine of the delightful French comedy, uses coffee to help two would-be lovers get together in the film, not by suggesting a coffee date but rather by spilling hot coffee on one to force them into the same room. The sparks fly from there.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2k9ome4", "description": "Celebrate National Coffee Day with these five shows and movies that are all about the beverage.", "authors": ["Kelly Lawler", "Published A.M.
