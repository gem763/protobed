We can never declare a ceasefire,\u201d Erdogan told journalists on a flight back from Azerbaijan, in comments published by the Hurriyet daily.\n\nEuropean powers \u2014 who are particularly spooked by the prospect that Islamic State group fighters jailed by the Kurds will go free \u2014 have taken an increasingly tough tone with Turkey.\n\nBritain and Spain became the latest powers to suspend military exports to Turkey. Canada made a similar move.\n\n\u2013 Kurds try to defend border \u2013\n\nA day after regime forces entered the key city of Manbij, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are mounting a desperate defense to the east of the border town of Ras al-Ain, using tunnels, berms and trenches.\n\nAn AFP correspondent in the area said clashes around the town continued Tuesday, despite Ankara\u2019s repeated claims it had captured the area.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Kurdish fighters had launched \u201ca large counterattack against Turkish forces and their Syrian proxies near Ras al-Ain\u201d, later reporting \u201cfierce combat\u201d in the west of town as well as in Tal Abyad.\n\nSince launching their assault on October 9, Turkish-backed forces have secured more than 100 kilometres (60 miles) of border, but Ras al-Ain \u2014 Siri Kani in Kurdish \u2014 has held out.\n\nErdogan, who like Trump faces political difficulties at home, wants to create a buffer zone stretching 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the border into Syrian territory.\n\nHe wants to keep at bay the SDF as well as resettle some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees now in Turkey.\n\n\u201cGod willing, we will quickly secure the region stretching from Manbij to our border with Iraq,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nThe offensive has killed dozens of civilians, mostly on the Kurdish side, and displaced at least 160,000 people.\n\n\u2013 Russia fills void \u2013\n\nRussia said its military police were patrolling a zone separating regime troops and Turkish forces, in cooperation with Ankara.\n\nRussia\u2019s special envoy on Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev, said Turkish and Syrian officials were in contact to avoid clashes which \u201cwould simply be unacceptable\u201d.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu also discussed Syria in a phone call with his US counterpart Mark Esper, Moscow said.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s critics saying that he handed over US allies and stretches of Syria to Russia, the United States tried to play down Moscow\u2019s role.\n\n\u201cThe number of Russians is very, very limited. But it only takes a few Russians with a big Russian flag to get everybody to pay attention,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters in Washington.\n\n\u2013 Jihadist breakouts \u2013\n\nThe Kurds lost 11,000 fighters as they helped Western powers crush IS.\n\nEuropean governments fear that the chaos could trigger mass breakouts by thousands of IS fighters, triggering a resurgence of the lethal group that has wreaked havoc through attacks in the West.\n\nThe Kurds have said hundreds of IS relatives have escaped.\n\nAt least three French women escapees were \u201cretrieved\u201d by IS, according to messages they sent to their lawyer seen by AFP.\n\nAn SDF official on Twitter Tuesday said more IS relatives had tried and failed to escape the overcrowded camped of Al-Hol in eastern Syria.\n\nThe US official, however, said that Washington was not aware of any \u201cmajor\u201d jihadist breakout, although between 50 and 150 women and children had fled.\n\nbur-jmm-ho-sct/it", "description": "Ras al-Ain (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 Kurdish fighters battled to defend a key Syrian border town from Turkish-backed forces in a flare-up of violence Tuesday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/15/b80577_missile-fired-by-turkish-forces-syrian-town-ras-al-ain-turkish-border-syrian-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
