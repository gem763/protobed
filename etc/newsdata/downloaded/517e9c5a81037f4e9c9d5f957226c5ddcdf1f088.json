The Russian Defense Ministry said on Wednesday morning that Russian military police units have arrived in Kobani to \u201cfacilitate the withdrawal of Kurdish YPG forces and their weapons.\u201d\n\nThe Russians effectively threatened to withdraw that protection unless the Kurds pull back the militia groups seen as terrorists by Turkey.\n\nThe Kremlin taunted Kurdish commanders by saying they have been \u201cbetrayed and abandoned\u201d by the United States, even though the Russians were threatening exactly the same type of withdrawal.\n\n\u201cThe United States has been the Kurds\u2019 closest ally in recent years. In the end, it abandoned the Kurds and, in essence, betrayed them. Now they prefer to leave the Kurds at the border and almost force them to fight the Turks,\u201d said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\n\nThe Russian statement came hours after President Vladimir Putin met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Black Sea resort of Sochi and made a deal for joint policing of the 20-mile-deep \u201csafe area\u201d Turkey desires along its border with Syria.\n\n\u201cAccording to this agreement, Turkey and Russia will not allow any separatist agenda on Syrian territory,\u201d Erodgan declared after the meeting, a reference to Turkey\u2019s allegations that Syrian Kurdish militia groups are allied with the violent separatist PKK party in Turkey.\n\nPutin said he explained the results of the Sochi summit to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad by telephone. According to the Kremlin, Assad \u201cexpressed his full support for the results of the work, as well as the readiness of the Syrian border guards, together with the Russian military police, to reach the Syrian-Turkish border.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe established status quo in the current Operation Peace Spring area covering Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn with a depth of 32 kilometers will be preserved,\u201d said a joint statement from Sochi read by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d is the name given by Turkey to its invasion of Syria.\n\n\u201cAll YPG elements and their weapons will be removed from Manbij and Tal Rifat,\u201d the statement declared, referring to the Kurdish militia.\n\nRussia and Turkey said they would establish \u201ca joint monitoring and verification mechanism\u201d to ensure their requirements are met.\n\nTurkish media reported on Wednesday that the withdrawal of YPG forces is under way, while the Turkish Defense Ministry said it has been informed that the withdrawal is complete. Turkey said it saw \u201cno need\u201d to resume hostilities given these developments.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the cease-fire in northeastern Syria is now effectively permanent and he would, therefore, lift sanctions against Turkey \u201cunless something happens that we are not happy with.\u201d", "description": "The Kremlin issues a warning to Kurdish forces to pull out of northeastern Syria or be \u201crun over by the Turkish military machine.\u201d", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177531439-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
