But that\u2019s exactly what happened on Thursday afternoon, during a Twitter feud about foreign policy between the libertarian-leaning Rand Paul and the hawkish Liz Cheney.\n\nIt all started when Paul, a Kentucky senator, shared a Washington Examiner op-ed that was critical of Cheney\u2019s stance on Afghanistan. He called her a \u201cneocon\u201d who advocates for \u201cendless wars.\u201d Cheney, a Wyoming congresswoman and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, blasted Paul in response, which prompted Paul strategist Doug Stafford to get involved.\n\nThis entire feud is regrettable. But Cheney\u2019s subsequent escalation is classless and out of bounds. Paul started this with a valid, if antagonistic, critique of her foreign policy. She responded by impugning his motives and suggesting that he\u2019s a terrorist sympathizer.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Polumbo", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Liz-Cheney-Slimes-Rand-Paul-As-Supporting-Terrorists-Because-He-Opposes-War"], "top_image": ""}
