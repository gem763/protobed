(Jeff Chiu/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\n\"It can be incredibly helpful with dealing with distracting emotions,\" Amy Baltzell, author of The Power of Mindfulness: Mindfulness Meditation Training in Sport, told The Current's Laura Lynch.\n\nBaltzell, herself a former Olympic rower and a sports psychologist at Boston University, now teaches mindfulness practices and meditation to athletes.\n\nNumerous studies have found that mindfulness meditation \u2014 a practice rooted in Buddhist teachings that involves focusing the mind on present experiences \u2014 has benefits for concentration, mental health and physical well-being.\n\nBaltzell used to be an athletic coach, and she often felt she had few tools to help her trainees overcome the anxiety, fear and embarrassment they often dealt with.\n\n\"You just can't say to someone: 'Just don't think that, just think about something positive,'\" she said.\n\nAfter she incorporated meditation in her own life, she realized it could also be a powerful tool for the athletes she was training. When they learn to meditate, she said, they \"can notice the frustration, accept the frustration and bring [their] attention back much more quickly to the game.\"\n\nBianca Andreescu speaks to the press after her 6-3, 7-5 U.S. Open championship victory over Serena Williams. 1:01\n\nMindfulness 'a primarily affluent movement'\n\nAs in sports, mindfulness practices have been adapted in the corporate world to appeal to more mainstream, secular audiences. Many companies, from Google to Goldman Sachs, train employees in mindfulness for stress reduction, and meditation is now estimated to be a billion-dollar industry.\n\nBut as that shift away from the Buddhist ethics at the roots of the practice continue, some experts are concerned about who is being left out of the modern mindfulness movement.\n\n\"It's a primarily affluent movement ... [and] a primarily white movement,\" said Jaime Kucinskas, associate professor of sociology at Hamilton College.\n\nKucinskas's book, The Mindful Elite: Mobilizing from the Inside Out, traces the rise of the mindfulness movement in North America. She traveled across the U.S. interviewing the leaders of the several organizations promoting meditation.\n\nShe found that, as many of them reached out to wealthy and powerful people in an attempt to help spread mindfulness far and wide, the practices morphed to appeal more to the tastes and lifestyles of powerful and wealthy audiences \u2014 with pricey retreats, conferences and corporate events being added to the itineraries.\n\nRichard 'Rich' Pierson, CEO and co-founder of the US meditation application 'Headspace', in Paris on June 4, 2019.

A meditation app called Liberate launched earlier this year, specifically aimed at users who are \"Black, Indigenous, and people of colour\" and featuring instructors of colour.\n\nOne Ottawa-based Buddhist meditation organization called True North Insight also offers meditation retreats for people of colour.\n\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.
