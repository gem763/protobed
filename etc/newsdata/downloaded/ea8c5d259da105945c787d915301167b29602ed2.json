His exhumation received strong support from those who believed it glorified the fascist dictator, and for those who lost loved ones at the hands of Franco\u2019s death squads especially, the move could not come soon enough.\n\n\u201cI never thought it logical or correct that a person like that who committed so much harm should be in a place like the Valley of the Fallen,\u201d one woman told The Independent, asking to remain anonymous. Her grandfather was killed in the war, but like tens of thousands of others, his body remains unrecovered in one of the mass graves across Spain.\n\n\u201cPeople nostalgic for Franco\u2019s era will use it to try to whip up some outrage, but that\u2019s not going to change what he is or was, whether he\u2019s in one place or another. Whatever we think of him is going to stay the same.\u201d\n\nHowever, the exhumation - after which Franco\u2019s remains were taken to Mingorrubio by helicopter - was passionately opposed by his family, and Spain\u2019s hard right, as well as parts of the church.\n\nKept at a distance of some 300 metres from the Mingorrubio-El Pardo cemetery by a long line of police, hundreds of Franco supporters waited hours for the funeral cortege and helicopter to arrive, chanting their devotion to the general.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a homage, this is to support Francisco Franco and his family at a time when they are suffering,\u201d Jose Ramon Medina, who travelled 400 miles from his home town of El Ejido, told The Independent.\n\n\u201cPeople die and are buried across Spain every day, but this is a desecration of a tomb. Maybe it\u2019s legal, but it\u2019s showing a total lack of respect.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

His son, Ramon, a priest, officiated a commemorative mass for Franco during his reburial.\n\nMany of the mostly middle-aged and elderly crowd outside the cemetery bore flowers and wreaths, and repeated chants of \u201cArriba Espa\u00f1a!, Viva Franco!\u201d well into the afternoon. Others were draped in illegal pre-democracy Spanish flags, wore Franco-era army hats or gave out posters of the general.\n\nWhen the funeral cortege containing Franco\u2019s relatives and the coffin passed by, arms were outstretched in the Fascist salute, and yet another hard-right anthem was sung.\n\n\u201cThey want to change the history of Spain 80 years after it happened,\u201d said an unemployed man who had driven through the night from Seville.\n\n\u201cThis exhumation is simply part of a political campaign, and coming here to pray for Franco\u2019s soul is something we have to do.\u201d\n\nMr Sanchez said it was necessary now to begin the process of identifying the thousands of Franco victims who were also buried at the mausoleum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an infamy that has to be repaired,\u201d he added.", "description": "The long-awaited and controversial exhumation of Francisco\u00a0Franco\u2019s remains from the Valley of the Fallen mausoleum, 44 years after his death, was finally carried out on Thursday.
