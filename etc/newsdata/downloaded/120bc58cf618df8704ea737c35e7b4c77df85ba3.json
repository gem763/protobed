Users can request a ride using the app and a vehicle will arrive, equipped with a seat cover and harness to buckle your four-legged friend into the backseat. The company is also testing unaccompanied rides for dogs as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently piloting that with our vet partners and we\u2019ll be rolling out that feature to the general public in probably about a month or so, when we partner up with a major pet retailer here in New York City,\u201d SpotOn CEO & Founder Aparna Srinivasan told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSrinivasan explained that got the idea for her company after having trouble getting a ride when traveling with her dog, Krishna.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a need, because obviously I travel with Krishna a lot -- going to the vet, going on a plane,\u201d she told YFi PM in an interview.\n\n\u201cAnd it's just much easier when you know that have that transportation to where you want to go, taken care of,\u201d Srinivasan added.\n\nRide-hailing app SpotOn aims to make traveling with your pet easier.

The startup also requires all of its drivers to have a license from the Taxi and Limousine Commission, and screens them by running their names through an animal cruelty database.\n\nOri Karev, a SpotOn shareholder, was once the U.S. CEO of ride-sharing app Gett. During that time, he learned that one of the biggest complaints for users was that people couldn\u2019t take their dogs or cats with them.\n\n\u201cDrivers were simply not equipped for that,\u201d he told told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThey were afraid pets may not like the car, or they may not like the pets, and they missed the whole boat.\u201d\n\nSpotOn is currently only available in New York City, but is aiming to expand in cities like San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago.\n\nMcKenzie Stratigopoulos is a producer at Yahoo Finance.
