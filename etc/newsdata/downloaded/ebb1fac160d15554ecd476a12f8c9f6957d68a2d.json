Buzz60\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again appearing before Congress to face questions about his company\u2019s massive market power, privacy lapses and tolerance of speech deemed false or hateful.\n\nZuckerberg has been summoned to testify at a hearing Wednesday by the House Financial Services Committee on Facebook\u2019s plan to create a global digital currency, which has stirred opposition from lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and Europe. But the full range of policies and conduct of the social media giant with nearly 2.5 billion users will be under the public glare.\n\nIt\u2019s the Facebook chief\u2019s first testimony to Congress since April 2018.\n\nThe company seems to spark public and official anger at every turn these days, from its shift into messaging services that allow encrypted conversations to its alleged anticompetitive behavior to its refusal to take down phony political ads or doctored videos.\n\nKey takeaways: Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor's 'explosive' opening statement\n\nE-skimming: Hackers hover near online shopping carts, too\n\nIn this May 1, 2018, file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote speech at F8, Facebook's developer conference, in San Jose, Calif.

They warn that it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the Financial Services panel, this summer asked Facebook to not move forward with the currency and a digital wallet called Calibra that would be used with it. Waters has called Libra \u201ca new Swiss-based financial system\u201d that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.\n\nSeveral high-profile companies that had signed on as partners in Facebook\u2019s governing association for Libra have recently bailed, spelling a potentially rough road for the project. But many experts don\u2019t believe it\u2019s doomed.\n\nThe defense of Libra: Access for those without bank accounts\n\nZuckerberg, in written testimony prepared for the hearing, aimed to reassure lawmakers that his company won\u2019t try to evade financial regulators as it readies Libra.\n\nFacebook \u201cwill not be a part of launching the Libra payments system anywhere in the world unless all U.S. regulators approve it,\u201d he said. That\u2019s a stronger statement than Facebook official David Marcus made to Congress in July, when he said the company will not activate Libra until it has \u201cfully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.\u201d Marcus leads the Libra project.\n\nThe rise of 'ghost kitchens': Here's what the online food ordering boom has produced\n\nZuckerberg is striving to defend Libra and alleviate concerns that the currency could sidestep regulators. Analysts say Libra could avoid regulation and launch in countries where it\u2019s not getting pushback, but this doesn\u2019t appear to be Facebook\u2019s intention.\n\nInstead, Zuckerberg is pushing an optimistic vision of Libra and what it could mean for people around the world who don\u2019t have access to bank accounts.\n\nCould it upset the Fed?\n\nWhile some critics see the recent exodus of some Libra partners as evidence of the plan\u2019s likely failure, U.S. regulators appear to view it as enough of a threat that they are considering the possibility of the Fed launching its own competitor currency.\n\n\u201cAt the Federal Reserve, we will continue to analyze the potential benefits and costs of central bank digital currencies, and look forward to learning from other central banks,\u201d Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, said in a speech last week.\n\nThere is concern among regulators that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency could supplant the Fed and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.\n\nZuckerberg also played the China card in his remarks, urging regulators to act quickly \u201cWhile we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn\u2019t waiting. China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Facebook CEO also has cited competition from China as a compelling reason against breaking up the company.\n\nThe Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting investigations of Facebook and the other huge tech companies amid accusations of abuse of their market power to crush competition.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, has advocated breaking up Facebook and other tech behemoths. She recently ran a fake political ad on Facebook taking aim at Zuckerberg to protest the company\u2019s policy of not fact-checking politicians\u2019 speech or ads in the same way it enlists outside parties to fact-check news stories and other posts.\n\nIn a major speech last week at Georgetown University, Zuckerberg defended the company\u2019s refusal to take down content from its platform it considers newsworthy \u201ceven if it goes against our standards.\u201d\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter are trying to oversee internet content while also avoiding infringing on First Amendment rights. The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence.\n\nPeople paid much more for gas in California last year: The governor wants an investigation\n\n'It\u2019s just too much': Meet the millionaires and billionaires who want a wealth tax\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/23/zuckerberg-appears-before-congress-facebooks-libra-currency-examined/4069799002/", "description": "The full range of policies and conduct of the social media giant with nearly 2.5 billion users will be under the public glare.", "authors": ["Marcy Gordon", "Barbara Ortutay", "Associated Press", "Published A.M.
