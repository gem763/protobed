Apprenticed to a shipowner, he eventually joined the Royal Navy, and is remembered today as Captain Cook.\n\nIn a series of remarkable voyages, Cook explored the coasts of New Zealand and eastern Australia, visited Tahiti, and also landed in Hawaii, which he named the Sandwich Islands, after his patron, the Earl of Sandwich.\n\nHawaii, however, proved to be his undoing.\n\nLocal tribesmen killed Captain Cook in an altercation on February 14, 1779.\n\n\"Death of Captain James Cook,\" by George Carter (1783). Oil on canvas. Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu\n\nAnd, in a story fit for Halloween, the tribe then boiled his dismembered body parts and removed the bones.\n\nJust to be clear, contrary to stories about cannibalism, Cook was NOT eaten.\n\nAnd one more thing: Despite some speculation inspired by the similarity of names, there's no proof that \"Peter Pan\" author J.M. Barrie used Captain Cook as the model for Captain HOOK.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Charis Satchell.", "description": "On October 27, 1728, the British naval officer and explorer was born in northern England", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/27/defae253-f70d-402d-9660-7d918facf7be/thumbnail/1200x630/23d694ce45e67de2586c9c2372bd84bc/captain-james-cook-promo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
