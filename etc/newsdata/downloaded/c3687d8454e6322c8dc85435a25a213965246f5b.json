Center fielder Kevin Kiermaier got things started with a three-run shot off Greinke in the second, with Ji-Man Choi and Brendan Lowe adding solo homers in the third and fourth.\n\nRays starter Charlie Morton was dominant against his former team, giving up just one run with nine strikeouts in five innings in Monday afternoon's win.\n\nAfter failing to put the series away, Astros manager A.J. Hinch announced that Justin Verlander will start Tuesday's Game 4 on three days' rest. Verlander threw seven shutout innings in a Game 1 win.\n\n\"Five-game series are pretty crazy. You never know what can happen,\" Verlander said postgame. \"You can't put all your eggs in one basket and say 'well if we lose tomorrow we've got Justin and Gerrit (Cole) for Game 5.'\"\n\nBOX SCORE: Rays 10, Astros 3\n\nYANKEES: Severino's return gives Bombers a huge boost\n\nTurning point\n\nWith a runner on second and two outs in the second inning, Greinke hit Travis d'Arnaud with a 1-1 fastball, bringing Kiermaier to the plate. Greinke fell behind 2-0 on Kiermaier and then left a changeup up in the zone, which Tampa's center fielder crushed to center field for a three-run homer.\n\nAll three home runs surrendered by the 35-year-old Greinke were on secondary pitches \u2013 changeups to Kiermaier and Choi and a curveball for Lowe.\n\nTampa batted around in that fourth inning, scoring four runs to expand the lead to 8-1.\n\nKevin Kiermaier celebrates his three-run homer in the second with teammate Avisail Garcia.

He ended up throwing 62 pitches in 2\u2154 innings.\n\nMiley was Houston's presumed Game 4 starter, so it's interesting that the Astros burned him trailing by four runs in a bit of speculative situation. It wasn't necessarily the wrong move \u2013 since the 32-year-old held left-handed hitters to a .207 average this season \u2013 but it forced his hand into selecting Verlander as the Game 4 starter.\n\nMan of the moment\n\nFive days after winning the wild-card game, Morton beat his former team to keep the Rays alive.\n\nThe 35-year-old got into trouble in the first, giving up a solo home run to Jose Altuve and then finding himself with runners on the corners and two outs after a walk and error. But Morton got Yuli Gurriel to pop out and a threat that could have resulted in a couple more runs.\n\nIn his career, Morton is now 4-0 with 0.95 ERA in elimination games.\n\nState of the series\n\nThe Astros get another chance to close things out on the road Tuesday, but it's not going to be a straight-forward game. Tampa is expected to do a bullpen game, though Game 1 starter Tyler Glasnow may be available to throw a few innings.", "description": "Tampa hit four home runs in a 10-3 win in Game 3 of the ALDS, keeping their season alive for at least one more day.", "authors": ["Jesse Yomtov", "Published P.M.
