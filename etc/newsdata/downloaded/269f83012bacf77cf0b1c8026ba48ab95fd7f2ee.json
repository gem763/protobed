The Todd Phillips\u2013directed, R-rated Batman spin-off provides an elaborate origin story for the Dark Knight\u2019s most famous antagonist, with Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix portraying the titular Gotham-menacing clown. The movie \u2014 which is, yes, violent \u2014 has been broadly described as \u201cincel-friendly\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d But it\u2019s the film\u2019s tenuous association with the 2012 shooting massacre in Aurora, Colorado \u2014 when James E. Holmes shot into the audience of the Century 16 movie theater, killing 12 and injuring 70 during a midnight screening of writer-director Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight Rises \u2014 that\u2019s posing a more specific disquiet for some. In a later-debunked report, Holmes was said to have told law-enforcement officers he \u201cwas the Joker.\u201d Now, three national theater chains as well as authorities in several American cities have gone on high alert, lest Joker prompt similar bloodshed.\n\nFor their part, the filmmakers maintain their movie has nothing to do with the national debate surrounding gun violence and hope viewers will evaluate Joker accordingly. \u201cThe thing is to be daring and bold and different \u2014 anything you can make that is unique coming out of the comic-book space into films and TV is important,\u201d Joker producer Michael Uslan told Vulture earlier this year. \u201cThe Joker movie, Todd Phillips\u2019s vision for it, is so different. Nobody\u2019s ever seen a comic-book movie like this before. I\u2019m sure there will be people who love it and people that hate it. But it\u2019s like watching a Martin Scorsese, lower-budget crime drama. It is going to be a very unique experience.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, prerelease tracking estimates indicate the movie could pull in $155 million over its opening weekend in theaters \u2014 with a surprisingly strong $80 million projected in North America alone. \u201cThe whole film has this edgy profile that breaks through the clutter and gets your attention in a way that another superhero movie might not,\u201d says Richard Rushfield, editor of the entertainment-industry newsletter The Ankler. \u201cBetween the real-life warnings and the intensity of the way the promotional stuff has come out, it grabs you by the neck.\u201d\n\nSo how did the film become something audiences seem to be simultaneously scared of and clamoring to see? Herewith, a timeline of Joker, fall movie season\u2019s most controversial movie:\n\nAugust 2017\n\nWarner Bros. reveals its intention to mount a movie detailing the origins of Joker \u2014 not the Joker, thank you very much \u2014 hoping to enlist Martin Scorsese as an executive producer and to entice Leonardo DiCaprio to slather on grease for the titular role. But when Jared Leto, who portrays the Joker in 2016\u2019s Suicide Squad and is contractually obliged to reprise the character in another DC Universe spin-off sequel, learns of the rival Joker project, he\u2019s caught off guard. The Academy Award\u2013winning Dallas Buyers Club actor reportedly makes his unhappiness with the idea of multiple Jokers abundantly clear to his agents at the Hollywood powerhouse Creative Artists Agency and weaponizes that concern to take meetings with rival agents at William Morris Endeavor.\n\nAlso during that month, producer Emma Tillinger Koskoff admits the production hit some turbulence in its attempts to convince the studio to take an edgy gamble with valuable IP. \u201cThis is a very gutsy move for Warner Bros. and I commend them,\u201d Koskoff told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThere were some hiccups trying to get the green light, and there were some concerns about the content. But once we locked and loaded our budget, they really gave us a tremendous amount of space to do what we do.\u201d\n\nSeptember \u2014 December 2018\n\nAccording to a New York Times interview with Phillips that picked up significant traction on Movie Twitter last month, Phoenix consistently baffles his co-stars during principal photography, losing his composure on set and bailing out mid-performance without a word of explanation. \u201cIn the middle of the scene, he\u2019ll just walk away and walk out,\u201d the director said. \u201cAnd the poor other actor thinks it\u2019s them and it was never them \u2014 it was always him and he just wasn\u2019t feeling it.\u201d\n\nAugust 11, 2019\n\nA draft of Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver\u2019s shooting script leaks online, causing widespread hand-wringing. Dated April 13, 2018, the screenplay sparks outrage for its sympathetic take on the Arthur Fleck backstory \u2014 portraying the villainous character as a victim worthy of compassion, a victim of a society gone mad. (In the comics, the Joker\u2019s behavior has been historically linked to criminal insanity and, across the decades, the character has offered scant justification for his evildoing.) Later, Phillips confirms the draft\u2019s authenticity but also refutes that it characterizes the finished film, explaining Joker\u2019s plotting has gone through numerous changes since spring 2018.\n\nNote: One day before the script leaked, Universal announced that The Hunt, a movie about a group of Americans who are kidnapped and dropped off in a rural area in Europe to be hunted for sport by rich people, would be indefinitely shelved following its own cycle of controversy.\n\nAugust 28\n\nThe final trailer for Joker drops, depicting a pitiable man suffering with mental illness who is ostracized by a corrupt society and forced to fend for himself in poverty. Compared to its Marvel superhero-movie brethren, it\u2019s clear Joker will substitute action and special effects for pathos \u2014 and a lot of it.\n\nAugust 31\n\nJoker\u2019s premiere at the 76th Venice International Film Festival draws an eight-minute standing ovation for Phillips and Phoenix, along with a critical outpouring of praise for the actor\u2019s performance as Fleck, a mentally ill sad sack and aspiring comedian who remakes himself as an icon of violent societal overthrow. Initial shock that Warner Bros. would deem the film worthy of placing it in competition at such a prestigious awards season subsiding, the conversation around the film quickly turned to its prospects for Academy gold. \u201cAbsolutely. It will be in the running,\u201d Venice director Alberto Barbera told Deadline.\n\nJoker goes on to claim the Golden Lion, the festival\u2019s top prize.\n\nAmid the Venice praise, however, comes full-fledged, pointed criticism, too. \u201cIn America, there\u2019s a mass shooting or attempted act of violence by a guy like Arthur practically every other week,\u201d Stephanie Zacharek wrote for Time. \u201cAnd yet we\u2019re supposed to feel some sympathy for Arthur, the troubled lamb; he just hasn\u2019t had enough love \u2026 the movie lionizes and glamorizes Arthur even as it shakes its head, faux-sorrowfully, over his violent behavior.\u201d\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as Joker.

Reviews out of the Canadian metropolis are decidedly mixed, with many critics pondering Joker\u2019s potential to inspire acts of domestic terrorism.\n\nSeptember 20\n\nA visibly agitated Phoenix storms out of an interview with U.K.\u2019s The Telegraph after being asked if he was worried Joker \u201cmight perversely end up inspiring exactly the kind of people it\u2019s about, with potentially tragic results.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Why, would you \u2026? No, no,\u201d the actor reportedly stammered before exiting.\n\nSeptember 23\n\nFive family members and friends of the 12 people killed during the Aurora shooting send a letter to Warner Bros. chief executive Ann Sarnoff reminding that a \u201ctragic event, perpetrated by a socially isolated individual who felt \u2018wronged\u2019 by society has changed the course of our lives,\u201d adding, \u201cWhen we learned that Warner Bros. was releasing a movie called Joker that presented the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause.\u201d The letter goes on to urge the studio to withhold campaign contributions to political candidates who accept money from the NRA, to use its political clout to lobby for gun reform, and to help fund gun-victim charities and gun-violence intervention programs.\n\nAlso that day, the U.S. Army Base at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, sends a memo to commanding officers, warning of a \u201ccredible potential mass shooting to occur at an unknown movie theater\u201d screening Joker. Citing an intelligence bulletin posted by the sheriff\u2019s office in Travis County, Texas, working in conjunction with local FBI operatives, the intelligence bulletin does not say where the violent attack by \u201cincels\u201d is set to occur. Only that the discovery is based on \u201cdisturbing and very specific chatter on the dark web.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommanders need to be aware of this threat for Soldier and family safety and to increase situational awareness should they choose to attend the release of this movie,\u201d the memo says.\n\nSeptember 24\n\nThe theater chain Cinemark and Warner Bros. announce that Joker will not be screened at the Century Aurora theater \u2014 formerly the Century 16, where the gun rampage occurred \u2014 or the Century XD.\n\n[Marketers are] playing it as an intense drama with a superhero world backdrop. It\u2019s been pretty effective.\n\nLater that afternoon, the studio \u2014 which donated $2 million to victims and survivors of the Aurora shooting massacre in 2012 \u2014 responds to the family members\u2019 and friends\u2019 letter with a cordial but firmly worded statement. \u201cGun violence in our society is a critical issue, and we extend our deepest sympathy to all victims and families impacted by these tragedies,\u201d it reads. \u201cAt the same time, Warner Bros. believes that one of the functions of storytelling is to provoke difficult conversations around difficult issues. Make no mistake: Neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers, or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\u201d\n\nSeptember 25\n\nOn the heels of recent mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio; El Paso, Texas; and Gilroy, California, the country\u2019s largest theater chain, AMC, issues a statement reiterating the enforcement of its policy forbidding masks, face paint, or objects that conceal a person\u2019s face. \u201cAMC does not permit weapons or items that would make other guests uncomfortable or detract from the movie experience.\u201d\n\nSeptember 26\n\nLandmark, the country\u2019s largest independent-theater chain, announces it will extend its usual ban on masks and toy guns to prohibit all costumes during Joker\u2019s theatrical run.\n\nAs evening descends on Hollywood, the Los Angeles Police Department issues a statement that there are \u201cno credible threats\u201d associated with the Sept. 29 Joker American premiere at the TLC Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Nonetheless \u201cthe Department will maintain high visibility around movie theaters when it opens.\u201d\n\nSeptember 28\n\nTexas-based Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas, a 40-location theater chain, announces it will beef up security specifically for Joker screenings over the movie\u2019s theatrical debut. \u201c[We] will have additional security personnel present at each location for the comfort of our staff and guests,\u201d Alamo says in a statement.\n\nIn an effort to thwart the rising din of questions from the press, Warner Bros. decides to scotch all broadcast and print interviews on the \u201cgreen\u201d carpet at the film\u2019s premiere at the TLC Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. The studio limits the appearances of Phillips, Phoenix, and co-stars including Zazie Beetz and Marc Maron to what basically becomes a glorified photo op.\n\nInside the theater, Phillips skips the usual drill of introducing his cast and producers, telling the audience: \u201cIf you like the movie, tell a friend. We haven\u2019t gotten enough press.\u201d\n\nSeptember 30\n\nNot to be outdone by their L.A. counterparts, New York Police Department chief of patrol Rodney Harrison orders all the city\u2019s precincts to provide police coverage at New York City theaters showing Joker. Coverage by uniformed officers is \u201cuntil further notice, so every showing time at each theater will be covered until we are directed to stop,\u201d a high-ranking police source told the New York Post. Officers \u201cshould be standing in high visibility at the main entrances.\u201d\n\nOctober 1\n\nWarner Bros. announces it is also restricting access to Joker\u2019s stars and filmmakers at its New York Film Festival premiere on Oct. 2, repeating the Hollywood premiere M.O. of photographs only. \u201cA lot has been said about Joker and we just feel it\u2019s time for people to see the film,\u201d a studio spokesperson told Variety.\n\nAppearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Oct. 1, Phoenix is seemingly ambushed when Kimmel confronts him on-air with a behind-the-scenes Joker clip featuring Joaquin in the midst of an expletive-laden rant. Done up in his character\u2019s signature green hair and grease paint, an aggrieved Phoenix tells cinematographer Lawrence Sher to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d and finds fault with the \u201cconstant whispering\u201d on set. In response, Sher refers to the actor as \u201cCher\u201d apropos his divalike behavior.\n\n\u201cThis is so embarrassing,\u201d Phoenix says on the show. \u201cThat was supposed to be private \u2026 I\u2019m sorry you guys had to see that!\u201d\n\nNews outlets deliver rat-pack coverage of the outtake, jumping at this latest opportunity to characterize the actor as a mercurial and thin-skinned artiste. The next day, however, Phoenix\u2019s publicist tells EW the reel \u201cwas a joke outtake\u201d and his stunned reaction to its reveal was all staged.\n\nOctober 2\n\nNotified of numerous threatening posts on social media that call for \u201cunspecific mass shootings\u201d connected to Joker, the FBI breaks with the standard practice of keeping quiet about its operations to announce that it is now coordinating with other branches of law enforcement and private-sector partners to deal with potential violence surrounding the film. Furthermore, an intelligence bulletin obtained by ABC News details an apparently new subset of the involuntary-celibate community who\u2019ve found solace in Joker\u2019s angry-loner-clown plotline: \u201cclowncels.\u201d \u201cWhile many Incels do not engage in violence, some within the community encourage or commit violent acts as retribution for perceived societal wrongdoing against them,\u201d the bulletin says, according to ABC. \u201cSome Incel attackers have claimed inspiration from previous mass shooters.\u201d\n\nIn the end, neither cascading security threats, myriad controversies, nor the $55 million film\u2019s hard-R rating manage to squelch enthusiasm for Joker, with Deadline reporting tracking estimates of earnings around $155 million globally. At the domestic box office, the film could pull in more than $80 million over its first three days to potentially surpass Sony\u2019s Venom ($80.25 million) as the top opening October movie of all time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a leading, trending story for about six weeks now, and that\u2019s a lot more spotlight and attention than a normal film could count on getting,\u201d says The Ankler\u2019s Rushfield. \u201cIt barely even looks like a superhero movie. In the marketing, it looks like an urban revenge drama. You see a little bit of the makeup, but you don\u2019t see any capes or super powers or using X-ray vision. They\u2019re playing it as an intense drama with a superhero world backdrop. It\u2019s been pretty effective.\u201d", "description": "Joker arrives with the kind of buzz Warner Bros. would surely prefer to avoid: concern that the gritty drama will inspire violence.
