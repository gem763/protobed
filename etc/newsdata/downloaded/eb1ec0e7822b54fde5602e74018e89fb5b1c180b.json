It was a momentous day in Britain\u2019s centuries-old Parliament as the legislature rose up to successfully challenge the power of the prime minister and his government over vital Brexit policy.\n\nEven if they can force Johnson to seek a delay to that deadline, any extension would have to be approved by each of the other 27 EU nations.\n\nThe cross-party rebels are determined to prevent a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit because of fears it would gravely damage the economy and plunge Britain into a prolonged recession while also leading to possible medicine and food shortages. The vote came hours after Johnson suffered a key defection from his party, costing him his working majority in Parliament.\n\nOn a day of high drama and acerbic debate in the House of Commons, lawmakers returned from their summer recess to confront Johnson over his insistence that the U.K. leave the European Union on Oct. 31, even without a withdrawal agreement to cushion the economic blow. Many shouted, \u201cResign!\u201d and protesters gathered outside Parliament to call for Britain to remain in the EU.\n\nRead: \u2018Sit up, man!\u2019: Jacob Rees-Mogg lambasted for lounging during key Brexit debate in Parliament\n\nA new general election would take Britain\u2019s future directly to the people for a third general election in four years. It is not clear Johnson would immediately get the two-thirds majority in Parliament needed to call a fresh vote because opponents are wary he might postpone the election date until after Brexit has taken place.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want an election but if MPs vote tomorrow to stop the negotiations and to compel another pointless delay of Brexit, potentially for years, then that will be the only way to resolve this,\u201d Johnson said minutes after he lost the vote in Parliament.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, two other prominent Conservatives signaled their intention not to seek re-election rather than bend to Johnson\u2019s will. Former Cabinet minister Justine Greening and former Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt also signaled their intention to stand down.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, lambasted the weakened Johnson and accused him of \u201criding roughshod\u201d over the constitution in order to crash Britain out of the EU without a deal.\n\nHe said he will not agree to a new election until legislation preventing a \u201cno-deal\u201d exit is in place.\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t winning friends in Europe. He\u2019s losing friends at home. His is a government with no mandate, no morals and, as of today, no majority,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\nJohnson, who became prime minister in July, has tried to crack down on members of his Conservative Party who oppose his Brexit plans, warning they would be expelled from the party if they supported parliamentary efforts to block or delay the withdrawal.\n\nDominic Grieve, who was attorney general in David Cameron\u2019s government, says the expulsion threats demonstrate Johnson\u2019s \u201cruthlessness.\u201d Greening said she feared her beloved party was \u201cmorphing into Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party.\u201d Former Treasury chief Philip Hammond warned of the \u201cfight of a lifetime\u201d if officials tried to prevent him from running in the next election.\n\nAll three oppose Johnson, with Hammond saying he expected a procedural motion to take control of business. If it passed, a vote to block a no-deal would be considered Wednesday.\n\nTime to block a \u201cno-deal\u201d departure is running short. Johnson last week maneuvered to give his political opponents even less time to block a chaotic no-deal Brexit, getting Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s approval to suspend Parliament. His outraged critics sued, and attorneys arguing the case at a court in Scotland completed submissions Tuesday. The judge could rule as soon as Wednesday.\n\nA no-deal Brexit will sever decades of seamless trade with Europe\u2019s single market of 500 million people. Economists warn of disruptions in commerce, and the U.N. trade agency UNCTAD estimated Tuesday a no-deal Brexit will result in U.K. export losses of at least $16 billion. Leaked government documents predicted disruptions to the supply of medicine, decreased availability of fresh food and even potential fresh water shortages because of disruption to supplies of water treatment chemicals.\n\nJohnson insists the potential for leaving without a deal must remain as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the EU.\n\nThough the EU is Britain\u2019s biggest trading partner, a no-deal Brexit would also hurt Europe \u2014 a fact not lost on Brussels. Johnson\u2019s supporters said lawmakers were weakening the government\u2019s negotiating position with the EU.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that has helped focus minds in the EU is that we\u2019re leaving come what may and we\u2019ve got a very focused task of what a good deal would look like,\u201d Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told ITV. \u201cBut the lingering doubt they\u2019ve got is: Will the shenanigans in Parliament somehow lead to the cancellation or the delay of Brexit?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s encouraging them, and weakening our position to actually get the deal we all want.\u201d\n\nThe bloc insists it won\u2019t renegotiate the agreement struck with former Prime Minister Theresa May, which Johnson considers unacceptable.\n\nJohnson has told French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel he could come up with a better alternative to the main sticking point in the stalled negotiations \u2014 the deadlock on the Irish border question.\n\nOnly 58 days from exit, the EU said it had received no proposals from the British government aimed at overcoming the impasse.\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said the EU\u2019s executive body, which supervises talks on behalf of Britain\u2019s 27 European partners, is operating on the \u201cworking assumption\u201d that Britain will leave the bloc Oct. 31.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered a major defeat in Parliament on Tuesday night as rebellious lawmakers voted to seize control of the Brexit...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ611_borisj_ZG_20190903184847.jpg"}
