Ships burn the dirtiest oil, known as bunker fuel; a waste product from the refinery process, literally scraping the bottom of the barrel, the crud in crude. It\u2019s so thick that you could walk on it at room temperature.\n\nAs a result, shipping is a major polluter \u2013 responsible for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions. Not surprisingly, innovators are starting to wonder if there is another way.\n\n\u201cAround 90% of everything we consume [in Britain] spends some time at sea, so we urgently need to make the transportation of goods more sustainable,\u201d says Will Templeman, an environmental scientist-turned-entrepreneur.\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside? Show Hide Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

He wondered if it would be possible to transport things such as coffee and chocolate with zero emissions. Then he remembered that this was how goods used to travel. By sailing ship.\n\nA quick online search revealed that a Dutch company was doing exactly that.\n\nThe owners of Fairtransport were inspired to revive sail cargo after witnessing at first hand the yellow smog caused by commercial vessels. They restored two ships, a 70-year-old minesweeper renamed the Tres Hombres and a wooden ketch called Nordlys that dates back to 1873.\n\nTempleman arranged to board the Tres Hombres, sailing from the Azores to the Netherlands. \u201cI was watching the ocean and it came like a ghost ship through the dawn mist. It looked like a pirate vessel. I was so excited.\u201d\n\nHe dreamed of launching his own ship but realised that the first step was to make full use of the sailing vessels already in service.\n\nFuture sailors: what will ships look like in 30 years? Read more\n\nHe set up as a broker and together with his business partner, Will Adeney, went in pursuit of products to sell. They found their perfect olive oil in Portugal and arranged to have it shipped to Devon on board the Nordlys. They later sourced coffee beans in Colombia, and shipped them to Europe on the Tres Hombres. Their business, Shipped by Sail, was born.\n\nIt joined a growing network of brokers and sailors passionate about transporting goods by wind power. The next step: to boost demand for this kind of transportation.\n\n\u201cConsumers already understand organic produce and fair trade, and the next step is clean transport,\u201d says Cornelius Bockermann, who founded Timbercoast, a German sail cargo company that has restored a schooner from 1920, and is now refitting a second.\n\nClean transport is the missing link, as many so-called sustainable or ethical goods are currently carried on ships that pollute the air and sea. The perfect example of this is plant-based meat, shipped around the world from California.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Will Templeman, left, and Will Adeney on board De Gallant.\n\nBritish couple Marcus and Freya Pomeroy-Rowden built their ship, the Grayhound, as a replica of an 18th-century lugger, and carry cargo between the UK and France, bringing West Country ale to Brittany and French wine to Cornwall. They supply small businesses along the way, for example providing wines to Dibble & Grub on the Isles of Scilly. The couple enjoy the lifestyle of spending months at sea, making a living, while making a difference.\n\nMarcus says they\u2019re bringing trade back to a human scale. \u201cWe\u2019re taking quality products and transporting them direct to a distributor. We can understand and explain the whole chain for our products, from manufacture to the table.\u201d\n\nIn France, TransOceanic Wind Transport has developed a labelling system with a voyage number, allowing the customer to see how products reached them.\n\nBroker Alex Geldenhuys launched New Dawn Traders in the UK about six years ago and is still developing her \u201cvoyage co-op\u201d model, bringing together farmers, ships and buyers.\n\nGeldenhuys has been inspired by local food communities and vegetable box schemes and wants to extend that movement overseas, building relationships with distant farmers to bring ethically produced, high-quality produce to the UK with a carbon footprint that is close to zero. She is seeking \u201cport allies\u201d to promote the idea in coastal communities, encouraging customers to pre-order products from the ships and turning collection events at the docks into celebrations of the whole process.\n\nA few weeks ago a French schooner, De Gallant, sailed into Bristol laden with produce from Portugal; the first time a tall ship had brought cargo to the city for decades. It was an emotional moment for Geldenhuys and the climax of years of work.\u201cIt was beautiful to watch her sailing in under the suspension bridge,\u201d she says. Local people milled around the ship, sampling olive oil, almonds and wines.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hong Kong, at the time the world\u2019s largest container ship and capable of carrying 21,413 containers, docks in Felixstowe, Suffolk, in 2017. Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA\n\nGeldenhuys acknowledges that currently she can only deliver to her customers twice a year. Templeman says: \u201cRestaurants and other businesses need a regular supply to be reliable. So we\u2019re warehousing goods.\u201d Olive oil on De Gallant was transported by electric van to a restaurant in Bristol.\n\nThe biggest challenge for sail cargo is scale. There are currently only a few small ships operating. Most companies feel that the time is ripe for expansion and have plans to build larger vessels. One of the founders of Fairtransport, Jorne Langelaan, has set up a new venture called EcoClipper to facilitate emission-free shipping worldwide. He is planning for more sailing ships running more routes more frequently.\n\nIn Costa Rica, Canadian Danielle Doggett is building a sailing ship called Ceiba, which looks set to become the largest in the world. The project uses tropical trees that have fallen in storms, and more trees are planted as the building proceeds.\n\nCeiba will be able to carry 250 tonnes of cargo (Tres Hombres and De Gallant take 35 tonnes), which is equivalent to around 10 containers. Yet this is still much smaller than the historic tea clippers, such as the Cutty Sark, and dwarfed by the largest modern container ships, which can carry more than 20,000.\n\nThe shipping industry knows that change is on the horizon. From next year new regulations will further limit sulphur oxide emissions from ships. The International Maritime Organization has announced its ambition to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The world\u2019s largest shipping company, Maersk, has gone further, pledging to be carbon-neutral by 2050.\n\nFlight risk: can we take the carbon out of air travel? Read more\n\nTempleman acknowledges that the largest companies want to make their fleets more energy-efficient, but points out: \u201cWe\u2019re coming from the opposite direction and offering emission-free shipping right now, while asking what sail shipping could have been with another 100 years of development.\u201d\n\nMarcus Pomeroy-Rowden adds: \u201cWe\u2019re waving a flag to say the world can\u2019t carry on as it is. We\u2019re also showing what can be done in a different way.\u201d\n\nBockermann stresses that industrial shipping is only cheap because it externalises the environmental costs. \u201cWhat you normally pay a shipping company doesn\u2019t account for the damage to the environment, pollution or health. Our costs are comparatively high but if you had to pay for the damage of conventional shipping then we wouldn\u2019t seem expensive.\u201d\n\nGeldenhuys adds: \u201cWe might not be the solution to how everything is shipped in the world but we can make people think about what they\u2019re buying and how it\u2019s getting here. It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless. But we can all do something. We don\u2019t need one solution to everything, we need a thousand solutions that can exist simultaneously.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.
