We have seen all four of the candidates, except one (Walters) refusing to run his campaign through the media. This is unlike a congress where we elect a party leader,\u201d van der Walt said.\n\nIn a statement, eNCA editor Jeremy Maggs said the station found it disappointing coming from a party that places a premium on free speech and rigorous discourse and debate.\n\neNCA had already advertised the event to its viewers throughout the week.", "description": "The DA has instructed four of its leaders contesting for the position of federal council chairperson not to engage in a public debate which was scheduled for Wednesday at 9pm on eNCA.", "authors": ["Mandisa Nyathi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9331/6f27988316b64c4f8a13e3e839f38734.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
