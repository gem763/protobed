Yesterday, Plame released her first campaign ad which got a lot of attention for the production values and visuals. The ad claims \u201cDick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff took revenge against my husband and leaked my identity. His name: Scooter Libby.\u201d But as the Washington Post points out today, that claim is false. It\u2019s true that Libby was aware of Plame\u2019s role and did speak to people about it within the government, but the leak that made it into print came from Richard Armitage:\n\nOn July 7, Libby had lunch with White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, who was leaving the administration, and told him that Wilson\u2019s wife worked at the CIA, indicating the subject was not widely known but not suggesting it was classified, Fleischer testified at the trial. That same day, Fleischer acknowledged to reporters that the 16 words in Bush\u2019s speech were \u201cincorrect.\u201d So Libby was talking about Wilson and Plame\u2019s possible role in his trip, at least within the administration. But the leak that tipped the soup came from elsewhere. On July 8, Armitage told columnist Robert Novak that Wilson\u2019s wife worked for CIA on weapons of mass destruction and suggested her husband for the mission. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I may be the guy who caused this whole thing,\u201d Armitage later told a colleague. \u201cI may have been the leaker. I talked to Novak.\u201d\n\nThe Post concludes Plame\u2019s statement that Libby leaked her identity is a three Pinocchio lie:\n\nPlame\u2019s name and CIA role was first disclosed in Robert Novak\u2019s column. Novak\u2019s original source was Armitage, and his confirming sources were Rove and a CIA spokesman. Novak\u2019s column led to the firestorm that launched a federal investigation. But no evidence shows that Libby disclosed Plame\u2019s role to Novak.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only dishonest claim made in the ad. As Karen pointed out yesterday, the suggestion that Plame served in hot spots like Iran and North Korea isn\u2019t true (she was stationed in Greece). Also, her reference to her Jewish heritage seems like an obvious attempt to deal with some of her own anti-Semitic tweets.\n\nThe ad looks great and I suppose for people who don\u2019t remember anything past last week it\u2019ll be a hit. Maybe that short memory for facts is what Plame is counting on.", "description": "\"... no evidence shows that Libby disclosed Plame\u2019s role to Novak.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Valerie-Plame.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
