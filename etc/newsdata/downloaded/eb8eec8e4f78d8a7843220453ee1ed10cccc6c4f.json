The Trump administration has advocated for this new role for Border Patrol, arguing that its agents would not approve as many \"credible fear\" interviews.\n\nAttorneys and immigrant advocates have said these law enforcement officers should not be responsible for interviewing migrants seeking a safe haven in the U.S.\n\n\"They are fundamentally the wrong people to be conducting them,\" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a policy analyst at the American Immigration Council, told CBS News. \"This is because the Border Patrol has a mission to apprehend and arrest and to take people into custody, and the job of screening someone for asylum needs to be done by someone from an agency whose job isn't to deport people. It needs to be an independent decision from an agency without an incentive to send people back to their country quickly.\"\n\nU.S. Border Patrol agent Carlos Ruiz helps asylum-seeking migrant families unload from a U.S. Border Patrol riverine unit after they were rescued during an attempted illegal crossing of the Rio Grande in Hidalgo, Texas, U.S., August 23, 2019.

DHS oversees both Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) asylum officers who have typically conducted credible fear interviews.\n\nIn statements to CBS News, both USCIS and CBP said a \"whole-of-government approach\" is needed to respond to the surge of Central American migrants heading towards the southern border.\n\nAccording to a CBP official, the agents assigned to the pilot program undergo five weeks of training into \"applicable laws and authorities\" with USCIS, in addition to their time at the Border Patrol academy. Their decisions, the official added, are reviewed by USCIS.\n\nA USCIS official said the CBP personnel conducting the interviews are receiving \"comparable training\" to that of asylum officers.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times first reported earlier Thursday that Border Patrol agents had started conducting these interviews at detention facilities for migrant families.\n\nMr. Trump and top officials in his administration have frequently criticized the high percentage of migrants who pass the initial credible fear interviews. Far fewer are ultimately granted asylum, a prolonged process in America's backlogged-ridden immigration courts. Officials have cited that disparity when arguing that many asylum seekers are economic migrants with \"fraudulent\" claims.\n\nReichlin-Melnick said the disparity makes sense since asylum is a \"difficult case to win.\" He noted that Congress purposely made it easier to pass the initial screening than to win asylum. He said officials should be tasked with \"erring on the side caution\" because the \"consequences of sending someone back to a country where they face persecution are so high.\"\n\nMigrant families turn themselves to U.S. Border Patrol to seek asylum following an illegal crossing of the Rio Grande in Hidalgo, Texas, U.S., August 23, 2019.

Additionally, the first interviews conducted by Border Patrol agents will be observed by USCIS supervisors.\n\n\"They will be required to show through their work that they have understood all applicable laws, regulations, policies, and procedures before being allowed to conduct interviews on their own,\" the USCIS official added.\n\nDespite these training procedures, Reichlin-Melnick said there is a clear conflict of interest in Border Patrol agents conducting these important interviews of migrants they may have apprehended, detained and interacted with before.\n\n\"How would [migrants] trust that person to tell the deepest, darkest secrets of their lives?\" Reichlin-Melnick asked.", "description": "Border Patrol agents \u2014 law enforcement officers \u2014 are now interviewing would-be asylum seekers who express fear about returning to their home countries", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/27/fc23ddb2-6e0f-4b87-b50d-308c8b8e66c4/thumbnail/1200x630/656173ba14f845175d638e765b80ff21/2019-08-24t123229z-1458912293-rc1398dd9520-rtrmadp-3-usa-immigration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
