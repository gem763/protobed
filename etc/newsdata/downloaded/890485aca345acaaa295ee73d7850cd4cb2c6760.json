I'm Alexei Oreskovic, Business Insider's West Coast Bureau Chief and Global Tech Editor.\n\nIf you're anything like me, you're in split-screen mode these days, monitoring the impeachment inquiry and the WeWork debacle at the same time. I've got plenty of updates for you on the latter, but before we get started, a quick reminder to tell your friends and colleagues to go here and sign up for this newsletter.\n\nThis week: WeWork's stomach-turning rollercoaster\n\nNot long ago, WeWork was known for parties so wild that the sight of vomiting employees (or worse) was as common as the \"hustle harder\" signs in its co-working spaces.\n\nIf any WeWork employees are feeling nauseated today though it's probably from the emotional roller coaster of the past week.\n\nThe hot, $47 billion startup that was bound for a blockbuster IPO has crashed into a wall of austerity. The corporate jet is on the auction block, acquisitions are being spun off, and the IPO has been somberly put on the shelf, right next to the $140-a-bottle tequila that founder Adam Neumann once poured so freely.\n\nIf you're not yet a subscriber to Trending, BI Prime's tech newsletter, you can sign up here.\n\nTo get a sense of what a shock this must be for the more than 10,000, mostly millennial, WeWork employees, check out the remarkable feature story by Megan Morris and Julie Bort that reveals what it was like to work at the company. Morris and Bort spoke to more than 20 current and former employees, and paint a stunning picture of a company in delirium.\n\nThese weren't the \"growing pains\" that many startups experience. At WeWork it was the culture created by the founders.\n\nThe big question now is whether an organization like WeWork can be rehabilitated into a \"normal\" company. Without Neumann, WeWork is now rid of the excesses and liabilities, but it's also bereft of the special energy that fueled its rapid rise.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nThe strange story behind WeWork's occupancy rates\n\nThe health of WeWork's business will be critical to any WeWork comeback, especially as it faces a cash crunch. And as Troy Wolverton and Alex Nicoll report, there's cause for concern in the occupancy rates that WeWork brags about.\n\nTo fill all the new office space that WeWork took on during its rapid expansion, WeWork made a habit of offering deep discounts and other incentives. In some cases, WeWork offered discounts of 50% or more to entice tenants in older, existing WeWork spaces to move into new WeWork spaces.\n\nWhile discounts are not unusual in the real-estate industry, the dynamics are different with WeWork. Unlike tenants in traditional office deals, who sign longterm, multi-year leases, WeWork tenants sign leases that are on average only 15 months. That means there's less time for WeWork to recoup the discounts through higher rents later on.\n\nAs one real-estate analyst in the story put it: WeWork's business is essentially \"a short-term lease that may very well wind up with nothing left at the end of it.\"\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nSilicon Valley is trying to diagnose what's ailing it\n\nIn the wake of the WeWork IPO implosion and disappointing debuts by Uber, Lyft and other high-profile startups, Silicon Valley investors and entrepreneurs are scrambling to diagnose the cause of the problem.\n\nAs Megan Hernbroth reports, VCs are looking for answers to explain the recent troubles, and for alternatives to protect their paydays.\n\nThe new fixation is the direct listing, which was the topic du jour at a special summit convened by VCs this week. But one of a few recent direct listings to look to \u2014 Slack \u2014 is down roughly 17% since it listed in June. Another narrative is that impostor tech companies are the real problem, with some VCs positing that the public markets have simply rejected old economy businesses masquerading as software companies.\n\nThe debate is far from resolved. And with several high-profile startups, including Airbnb and Postmates, still eyeing the public markets, expect more discussion and finger-pointing.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nTwo stock traders are dressed as doctors as they joke in front of the German share prize index DAX board at the German stock exchange in Frankfurt, February 24, 2009.
