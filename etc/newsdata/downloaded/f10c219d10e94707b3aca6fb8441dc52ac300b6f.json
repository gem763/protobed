Even at that time, US officials worried about Turkey and other NATO members using the weapons without the permission or knowledge of the US. In the 1970s, when war between Greece (which also stores nuclear weapons) and Turkey seemed imminent, the US moved its nuclear stockpile from Greece and disabled the bombs in Turkey.\n\nExperts have questioned the wisdom of having weapons housed in Turkey. In 2016, Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at Middlebury College, wrote of the weapons' uncertain security in the wake of a near coup that year.\n\n\"An airbase is a not a fortress; it is not intended to withstand a siege by the host government any more than an embassy might,\" Lewis wrote at the time, although the US has invested millions in upgraded security for its nuclear arsenal.\n\n'It's not just about the security, it's that they serve no military purpose.'\n\nAccording to Hans M. Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, there are several potential scenarios for how the US's B61 arsenal at In\u00e7irlik could be compromised.\n\n\"One involves relations with Turkey breaking down and interfering with the base operations, that is probably a wildcard,\" Kristensen told Insider via phone.\n\n\"The other scenario is a well-coordinated terror attack, causing havoc from inside,\" he said.\n\nWhile the weapons are \"very well-protected physically so it's hard to imagine coming in from the outside,\" the near-coup in 2016 saw F-16s at the base used to bomb the Turkish Parliament, and one of the alleged coup-plotters as the commander at Incirlik.\n\nKristensen noted that Incirlik is \"radically different than any other nuclear storage site,\" given the political instability there and the increasingly poor relationship between the US and Turkey. If the weapons weren't already there, Kristensen said, it's unlikely that they'd be deployed in Turkey.\n\nIn terms of removing the weapons, logistically speaking it would be as simple as pulling up a couple of C-17s up to the base, loading the weapons in \u2014 likely under the cover of darkness to avoid attention \u2014 and flying them back to the US, Kristensen told Insider.\n\nBut politically, that's another matter entirely.\n\n\"A number of us have felt since the attempted coup in 2016 is that it's increasingly untenable to keep the weapons in Turkey,\" Jessica Varnum, Deputy Director of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at Middlebury, told Insider.\n\nThe only way to avoid political fallout with Turkey would be to remove the US nuclear arsenal from all the NATO countries where they are stored.\n\n\"It's not just about the security, it's that they serve no military purpose,\" Varnum said of the weapons.\n\nWhile the weapons were originally deployed to NATO member countries to demonstrate the US's commitment to the alliance against Russia and to prevent these allied nations from developing their own nuclear weapons, they're not useful in a real conflict, Varnum said, since it would take US assets far too long to get to the weapons to effectively use them.\n\n\"They're not particularly credible as a military threat, because of the timeline.\"\n\nRemoval of the weapons from NATO countries is not a likely scenario, Varnum said, citing Trump's push to modernize the nuclear arsenal and the likelihood of NATO red tape around removing the weapons.", "description": "The US-Turkey relationship has soured over the past several years, but the US still stores as many as 50 B61 gravity bombs at In\u00e7irlik Air Base.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9ba62872fd823e406ce4cf?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
