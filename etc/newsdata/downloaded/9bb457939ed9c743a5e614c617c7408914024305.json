The piece offers an interesting look at the issue but it won\u2019t surprise you to learn that Beauchamp believes the right is the greater threat to liberalism. I think he\u2019s wrong about that but to explain why I\u2019ll need to breeze through the set up for his argument.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s be clear about what Beauchamp means be liberalism. He defines it as \u201cdemocracy, the rule of law, individual rights, and equality.\u201d He\u2019s not talking about ordinary partisan liberalism but what he terms the \u201coperating system\u201d that undergirds the left-right divide:\n\nBush-era American conservatism was a right-wing species of liberalism; what Americans call \u201cliberalism\u201d is a relatively modest form of left-liberalism\u2026 To challenge liberalism is thus to not merely engage in ordinary political argumentation. It is to call into question the entire operating system that defines the world\u2019s democracies. It is, by its nature, a radical claim.\n\nBeauchamp argues that the people who are challenging or threatening these fundamental ideas are populists:\n\nBy one count, illiberal right-wing populists controlled the governments of least 11 different countries in 2018; in 1990, they controlled none.\n\nIf you click through the link, the piece he\u2019s referring to explicitly says there were four populists in power in 1990 and that there were 20 as of 2018. In any case, it\u2019s worth noting that some of the populists being considered aren\u2019t of the right-wing variety. Nicolas Maduro and Daniel Ortega are listed as populists in power, though Beauchamp never mentions this.\n\nSo who does Beauchamp identify as threats to this broad consensus? On the right, he says it\u2019s mostly Catholics who are to blame:\n\nThe key proponents of this view are heavily (though not exclusively) Catholic; many draw from their faith\u2019s long tradition of anti-liberal thought. They have a small presence in the academy \u2014 Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen and Harvard legal scholar Adrian Vermeule, for example \u2014 but are much less visible in the professoriate than socialists. The right-leaning anti-liberals are more often found in the punditry, conservative think tanks, and even in the ranks of actual political parties (particularly in Europe). The Christian publication First Things is a particular hub of media activity for these anti-liberals, as is the American Conservative magazine. Sympathetic writers can be found at outlets ranging from the New York Times to National Review to the New York Post. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) is a conservative anti-liberal; on the far right, anti-liberals include Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Polish European Parliament member Ryzard Legutko\u2026 They believe that liberalism\u2019s vaunted neutrality \u2014 its claim to respect all citizens\u2019 freedom to follow their own paths in life \u2014 is a sham. Liberalism can only truly tolerate belief systems that cohere with its vision of freedom, and will actively attempt to stamp out worldviews that it concludes are hostile to that ideal. In the right anti-liberal imaginary, liberal tolerance is fundamentally intolerant. Hence attempts to force Hobby Lobby\u2019s insurance to cover birth control and Christian bakers to make cakes for gay weddings\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go so far as to say the left\u2019s tolerance is fundamentally intolerant but it\u2019s certainly not equally tolerant to all. There seems to be no hesitation about mocking the faith of Christians. Just a decade ago that was all the rage. There was a publishing boom around new atheism and many think-pieces about the threat of \u201cdominionists,\u201d but the number of progressives who\u2019ve said or written a bad word about Islam or Muhammad can be counted on one hand and even then it\u2019s usually followed by a backlash from other progressives.\n\nThere\u2019s also something to be said for the individual freedom of Christian bakers. After all, the Supreme Court did decide last year (in a decision written by Justice Kennedy) that baker Jack Phillips was religiously discriminated against by the Colorado agency that looked into his case. Does Beauchamp believe that Justice Kennedy, the Court\u2019s former swing-voter, was at war with liberalism?\n\nBut where Beauchamp\u2019s analysis really falls down is when he considers the threat posed by the left. I think he identifies the threat correctly but he immediately downplays it in a way that suggests he\u2019s not interested in pursuing this line of inquiry very far:\n\nThe core concepts of the leftist narrative have been worked out for decades by Marx-influenced scholars like the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Adolph Reed Jr., the New School\u2019s Nancy Fraser, and the City University of New York\u2019s David Harvey. It\u2019s become prominent thanks to the emergence of vibrant leftist magazines like Jacobin and its adoption by prominent public intellectuals like Mishra\u2026 So long as capitalists are free from democratic constraint, leftists argue, liberal democracy is on dangerous footing. The super-rich use the power their accumulated wealth provides to influence political life, rearranging policy to protect and expand their fortunes. The rise of neoliberalism is, per the socialist writer Peter Frase, this process in action: proof that capitalism will invariably corrupt liberalism\u2019s promise of freedom and equality. For all their anti-liberal rhetoric, virtually none of today\u2019s serious left critics of liberalism are Stalinists or Maoists \u2014 that is, opponents of democracy itself. They believe in liberal rights like freedom of expression, and pursue their revolutionary agenda through social organizing and democratic elections.\n\nFirst of all, wow! That\u2019s quite a bar you\u2019ve set for the anti-liberals on the left. I mean, he can\u2019t even say this is true of all left critics of liberalism, only of the \u201cserious\u201d ones. But can\u2019t we equally say that none of today\u2019s serious right-wing critics of liberalism are Hitler? If the standard being applied is that someone isn\u2019t really an anti-liberal unless they\u2019ve killed several million people to prove the point then I don\u2019t think the writers at First Things are really that close to the line. It seems to me that two very different standards are being applied here.\n\nSecondly, remember a few paragraphs earlier when I mentioned that Beauchamp never bothered to point out that some of the populists he was warning us about were actually democratic socialists? I have to wonder if that oversight was accidental because it really undercuts his point. In fact, some of today\u2019s left critics of liberalism, like Daniel Ortega and Nicolas Maduro, are getting harder to distinguish from Stalin or Mao. You could even argue that Chinese Communism represents a sustained criticism of classical liberalism from the left.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just foreign dictators. If you set the bar for anti-liberalism a little below Stalin, we\u2019ve recently had presidential candidates on the left discuss plans to have \u201cgun buybacks\u201d which is a polite way of saying confiscation under threat of jail. Other priorities on the far-left agenda include court-packing, a favorite among dictators (like Maduro).\n\nWe also have far-left support for Antifa which goes far beyond the number of people actually wearing masks and breaking things in the streets. This is a group which intentionally resorts to political violence, yet they get defended and applauded by many on the left and even compared to veterans landing at Normandy by some journalists.\n\nIf you look, it\u2019s not hard to find illiberalism on the left. Beauchamp mentions Jacobin favorably. My guess was that I could bring up the site and find some example of illiberalism on the current home page. I was not wrong:\n\nSo do the math on this. The UBI Sawicky describes requires $3.2 trillion while capital\u2019s share is $5 trillion. It looks like the UBI already exists. It is just very unevenly distributed. Liquidating the capitalist class will of course be difficult to pull off politically, but it is important that we distinguish between political difficulty and what is possible as a policy matter.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not Stalin. He\u2019s not suggesting we liquidate the Kulaks. But what he is contemplating seems as anti-liberal in its intent as anything you\u2019ll find at National Review.", "description": "\"none of today\u2019s serious left critics of liberalism are Stalinists or Maoists\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Vox.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
