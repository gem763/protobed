Baidu and JD.com also traded lower. Those shares all trade on Nasdaq.\n\nThe iShares China Large-Cap ETF dropped 1% in a sudden move. The ETF's biggest holdings are China Construction Bank and Tencent holdings.\n\nChinese currency yuan weakened to 7.15 against the dollar on the news.\n\nThe move would come as the U.S. and China are set to resume trade talks on Oct. 10 in Washington after both countries slapped billions of dollars of tariffs on each other's goods. Delisting Chinese companies would affect billions of dollars in investment pegged to major indexes, just as the Chinese government is taking steps to increase foreign access to its markets.\n\nA White House spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe exact detail has not been worked out yet and the plan is subject to President Donald Trump's approval, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Trump had greenlit the discussion, the report said.\n\nSources told CNBC's Eamon Javers the White House could include a block on all U.S. investments in China and the goal is to protect American investors. No decisions have been made and it's nowhere near complete, the sources said.\n\nThis is a developing story.
