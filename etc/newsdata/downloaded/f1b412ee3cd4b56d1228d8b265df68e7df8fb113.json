It is coming soon. Of course we don\u2019t yet know who is likely to be in Downing Street, the situation is very fluid.\u2019\n\nThe Scotland Act 1998 itself does not devolve power to the Scottish Parliament to authorise a referendum on independence.\n\nThis means the First Minister of Scotland needs to seek an Order in Council under Section 30(2) from the UK government.\n\nFrantic week ahead will decide the UK's future over Brexit\n\nScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has already spoken out against another referendum, stating: \u2018We need to resolve the constitutional crisis \u2013 not create another one\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018Scotland needs a Labour government that will deliver \u00a370 billion of investment in our country. Our NHS, schools and business need this investment.\n\n\u2018The prospect of a socialist Britain offers far more than that of a separate Scotland.\u2019\n\nWhile Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, argued that the people of Scotland \u2018do not want or need another divisive referendum\u2019.\n\nThe referendum would take place in the latter half of 2020 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nShe said the request would not be granted by the UK government, adding that \u2018barely a quarter of people\u2019 support Sturgeon\u2019s plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSturgeon has held strong on her view that a legal referendum is the only route for Scotland to secure independence.\n\nSome activists within the SNP have backed holding a Catalonian-style wildcat poll or taking winning a majority of seats at Westminster as a \u2018plan B\u2019 option for independence negotiations.\n\nMasked man tries to lure girl, 9, with Jelly Babies outside primary school\n\nWriting in the Sunday Mail, Sturgeon declared she would not \u2018fall into the trap\u2019 of deviating from a \u2018legal and constitutional\u2019 Scottish referendum.\n\nShe said: \u2018We don\u2019t need to be talking about plan B when we have a perfectly good plan A \u2013 especially when any plan B is exactly the route many opponents of independence would like us to go down.\n\n\u2018If we were to try to hold a referendum that wasn\u2019t recognised as legal and legitimate \u2013 or to claim a mandate for independence without having demonstrated majority support for it \u2013 it would not carry the legal, political and diplomatic weight that is needed.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
