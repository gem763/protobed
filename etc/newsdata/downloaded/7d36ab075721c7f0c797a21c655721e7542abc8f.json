He was nicknamed Le Bulldozer early in his career for his determination and ambition.\n\nAs president from 1995 to 2007, he was a consummate global diplomat but failed to reform the economy or defuse tensions between police and minority youths that exploded into riots across France in 2005.\n\nYet Chirac showed courage and statesmanship during his presidency.\n\nIn what may have been his finest hour, France's last leader with memories of the Second World War crushed the myth of his nation's innocence in the persecution of Jews and their deportation during the Holocaust when he acknowledged France's part.\n\n\"Yes, the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French state,\" he said on July 16, 1995. \"France, the land of the Enlightenment and human rights ... delivered those it protects to their executioners.\"\n\nChirac stands in front of a portrait of Gen.

(Charles Platiau/Reuters)\n\nWith words less grand, the man who embraced European unity \u2014 once calling it an \"art\" \u2014 raged at the French ahead of their No vote in a 2005 referendum on the European constitution meant to fortify the EU. \"If you want to shoot yourself in the foot, do it, but after don't complain,\" he said. \"It's stupid, I'm telling you.\" He was personally and politically humiliated by the defeat.\n\nHis popularity didn't fully recover until after he left office in 2007, handing power to protege-turned-rival Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron will make a speech in homage to former Chirac in a national address on television set for 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET).\n\nMacron cancelled a visit to the southern town of Rodez for a public meeting on his planned overhaul of the retirement system.\n\nPraised in France for common touch\n\nChirac ultimately became one of the French's favourite political figures, often praised for his down-to-earth human touch rather than his political achievements.\n\nIn his 40 years in public life, Chirac was derided by critics as opportunistic and impulsive. But as president, he embodied the fierce independence so treasured in France: He championed the United Nations and multipolarism as a counterweight to U.S. global dominance, and defended agricultural subsidies over protests by the European Union.\n\nMourners are bringing flowers to Chirac's residence and looking past his problems to share grief and memories of a man who long dominated France's political scene.\n\nPolice put up barricades around the apartment where Chirac's family lives as mourners arrived Thursday. Earlier, France's lower house of parliament held a minute of silence.\n\nFrench police stand guard as flowers are delivered to Chirac's home in Paris.

His slicked-back hair and ski-slope nose were favourites of political cartoonists.\n\nYet he retained a common touch that worked wonders on the campaign trail, exuding warmth when kissing babies and enthusiasm when farmers \u2014 a key constituency \u2014 displayed their tractors. His preferences were for western movies and beer \u2014 and t\u00eate de veau, calf's head.\n\nChirac, right, pictured in 2000 beside U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, retained a common touch that included preferences for western movies and beer.

But his government quickly fell out of favour and parliamentary elections in 1997 forced him to share power with Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.\n\nThe pendulum swung the other way during Chirac's re-election bid in 2002, when far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen took a surprise second place behind Chirac in first-round voting. In a rare show of unity, the moderate right and the left united behind Chirac, and he crushed le Pen with 82 per cent of the vote in the run-off.\n\n\"By thwarting extremism, the French have just confirmed, reaffirmed with force, their attachment to a democratic tradition, liberty and engagement in Europe,\" Chirac enthused at his second inauguration.\n\nLater that year, an extreme right militant shot at Chirac \u2014 and missed \u2014 during a Bastille Day parade in 2002. Inspecting troops, the president was unaware of the drama.\n\nOpposition to U.S.-led invasion of Iraq\n\nWhile he had won a convincing mandate for his anti-crime, pro-Europe agenda at home, Chirac's outspoken opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 rocked relations with France's top ally, and the clash weakened the Atlantic alliance.\n\nAngry Americans poured Bordeaux wine into the gutter and restaurants renamed french fries \"freedom fries\" in retaliation.\n\nThe United States invaded anyway, yet Chirac gained international support from other war critics.\n\nTroubles over Iraq aside, Chirac was often seen as the consummate diplomat. He cultivated ties with leaders across the Middle East and Africa. He was the first head of state to meet with U.S. President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks. Chirac was greeted by adulating crowds on a 2003 trip to Algeria, where he once battled Algerians fighting for independence from France.\n\nFound guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money\n\nAt home, myriad scandals dogged Chirac, including allegations of misuse of funds and kickbacks during his time as Paris mayor.\n\nHe was formally charged in 2007 after he left office as president, losing immunity from prosecution. In 2011, he was found guilty of misuse of public money, breach of trust and illegal conflict of interest and given a two-year suspended jail sentence.\n\nHe did not attend the trial. His lawyers explained he was suffering severe memory lapses, possibly related to a stroke. While still president in 2005, Chirac had a stroke that put him in the hospital for a week. He had a pacemaker inserted in 2008.\n\nTwo painful setbacks in his career involved student protests:\n\nIn 1986, a student was killed during protests over university reforms while Chirac was prime minister, prompting him to abandon the measure.\n\nIn 2006, Chirac withdrew a measure that would have made hiring and firing young people easier after weeks of nationwide student action. He failed repeatedly in efforts to reform France's labor rules and economy.\n\nIn recent years, Chirac was rarely seen in public. He was visibly weak and walked with a cane at a November 2014 award ceremony of his foundation, which supports peace projects.\n\nChirac is survived by his wife and younger daughter, Claude. His daughter Laurence died in 2016 after a long illness that Chirac once said was \"the drama of my life.\"", "description": "Former French president Jacques Chirac, who led France from 1995 to 2007, has died at 86, his son-in-law confirmed\u00a0on Thursday.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5297851.1569492614!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/607425362.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
