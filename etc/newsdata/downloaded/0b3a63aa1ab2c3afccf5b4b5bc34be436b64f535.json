The donation came from a company called Global Energy Producers, and we reported on suspicions that it was acting as a \u201cconduit\u201d contributor, effectively concealing the identities of the actual source or sources of that money.\n\nAfter publication, we got a call from a relatively prominent Trumpworld operative, who proceeded to berate us for reporting on the allegations, which the person insisted were completely trumped-up and politically motivated. Global Energy Producers, he said, was fully capitalized by investors in the energy space, and was conducting bona fide business in pursuit of contracts to export liquified natural gas to Europe.\n\nThat was 100 percent untrue, according to federal prosecutors.", "description": "Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested Wednesday, vindicating more than a year of reporting on their shady political donations.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570739054/191010-paydirt-arrests-tease_xeig2v", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
