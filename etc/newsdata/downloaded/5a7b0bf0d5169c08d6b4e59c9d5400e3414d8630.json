We\u2019ve designed our pillow to be fully adjustable to complement each person\u2019s needs for the best sleep ever.\n\nAlthough there may be other \"adjustable\" pillows out there, those tend to just come in different fill levels and don't allow for actual adjustability. Our pillow is fully adjustable in that you can add, remove, and shape the fill to suit your size and sleep position(s). This allows for much more customization to suit each person's unique needs.\n\nMost importantly, we use brand new memory foam, not leftover scraps like many other companies. The memory foam in our pillows is CertiPUR-US\u00ae certified to ensure safety and quality. Additionally, the Original Pillow has achieved GREENGUARD [GOLD] Certification. GREENGUARD Certified products are certified to GREENGUARD standards for low chemical emissions into indoor air during product usage.
