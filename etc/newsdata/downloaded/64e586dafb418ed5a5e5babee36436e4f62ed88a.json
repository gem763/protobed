Things appeared on the rocks before President Donald Trump announced secret talks between the Taliban, U.S., and Afghanistan government were scuttled over a bombing in Kabul. The Afghani government was already irked about the deal in principle reached between the U.S. and Taliban last week. America is still hoping for some kind of peace deal even if the violence has escalated this year.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Afghanistan politicians who are angry about any sort of ceasefire. South Carolina U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham has long decried any notion of a peace deal which doesn\u2019t put \u201cAmerica First.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny deal that calls for withdrawing our forces completely from Afghanistan is a bad deal for the United States.,\u201d Graham and retired Army General Jack Keane wrote in The Washington Post last month. \u201cWe must be clear: The United States should never outsource its national security to anyone, especially the Taliban. That is a possible outcome, however, as the United States and the Taliban continue talks in Doha, Qatar. We cannot rely on the Taliban for security; we have lost too many soldiers at Taliban hands for that. The Afghan war must end on our terms, not the Taliban\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThere is a danger to Graham\u2019s thinking, especially when using the phrase \u201cour terms\u201d because of its elasticity.\n\nTrump\u2019s foreign policy tends to run the gamut between attempted disengagement to possible escalation to keeping the status quo (see Syria). His Afghanistan policy has followed a similar arc with Trump saying in 2017 his instincts were to get out but he wanted to \u201cfight to win\u201d to ordering the removal of 7K troops in 2018 to reports he wanted all troops out by 2020 to deciding America will \u201calways have troops\u201d in Afghanistan last month. The whiplash is understandable!\n\nThe other elasticity is the fact Trump is not guaranteed victory in next year\u2019s presidential election. A different administration might try another surge or something else entirely. They might scuttle the peace process Trump\u2019s Administration is attempting despite the emotional pendulum from the Oval Office.\n\nMayhaps it\u2019s best for Trump to turn his rhetorical, \u201cHow many more decades are they willing to fight?\u201d question inward and ask how long America wants to stay in Afghanistan. We\u2019ve been there almost two decades and a countless number of American soldiers and civilians are dead. Graham should also consider this rhetorical question in earnest before writing another piece advocating for ending war \u201cthe right way,\u201d whatever that means. The idea of the victory sought by former President George W. Bush for the September 11th attacks appears to have long disappeared or abandoned in exchange for saving face. There\u2019s no chance to get it back either. Too many people are dead both at home and on the battlefield. Too many lives are ruined.\n\nWas it wise for Trump to invite, then uninvite the Taliban and Afghanistan politicians to Camp David? Let\u2019s go with the idea Trump is telling the truth about the negotiations, first. The notion of talks inside a vacuum isn\u2019t a bad idea because it gives negotiators the chance to sit down and get to know each other. Camp David has been used as a diplomatic site before particularly by Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Some people are mad the U.S. even considered talks with the Taliban but the negotiations have been going on for months. Publicly canceling them may be a mistake, even if it feeds into Trump\u2019s belief he\u2019s some sort of master negotiator. Of course, negotiating real estate deals is a lot different than foreign affairs negotiations (see China).\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with America and Afghanistan is not unlike the situation in Syria with Russia. Both countries are propping up an established government against insurgents although Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani appears to be a better person than Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian Army and Afghan security forces have sullied reputations due to accusations of human rights violations. The established governments are fighting insurgent groups which have connections with terrorism: Afghanistan is dealing with the Taliban while Syria is battling Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Free Syrian Army. The peace process is dragging on in both countries. ISIS presents a problem.\n\nThe War in Afghanistan needs to end and end quickly. Trump\u2019s desire for a troop pullout is laudable and a goal worth achieving. The decision to end the peace process is disappointing, and will hopefully only be temporary. The alternative is more war and more dead Americans.", "description": "Restart the peace process.", "authors": ["Taylor Millard", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
