In that instance, Trump initially vowed action on background checks following mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, but then softened his support for new policies following conversations with the National Rifle Association and eventually receded into vague statements about next steps.\n\nA similar trend could be starting to play out regarding vaping, which Trump came out strongly against earlier this week.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Trump-Vaping-Tweet Index.Html"], "top_image": ""}
