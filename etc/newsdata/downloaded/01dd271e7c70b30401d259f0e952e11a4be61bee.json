The margin of error overall is about 2%.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, we largely focused on these two generations because they're in their prime working years. While Gen Z and baby boomers were both surveyed, we refrained from analyzing both generations as many aren't in the workforce (either not yet working or retired).\n\nThe majority of indebted millennials and Gen X are feeling the burden of their debt loads. Gen X is more downtrodden when it comes to their finances, while millennials think they're doing okay \u2014 at least, compared to their peers. And both aren't adequately preparing for retirement.\n\nHere are some of the key themes that repeatedly popped up in the survey results.\n\nMillennials and Gen X are equally stressed about money\n\nMillennials are known for being financially behind thanks to the fallout of the Great Recession, high costs of living, and staggering student-loan debt \u2014 but Gen X is just as nearly just as stressed about money, especially when it comes to debt.\n\nOf the respondents who answered, more than half of all millennials and Gen X respondents said that they were stressed \"some\" or \"a lot\" about their credit card, personal loan, or student loan debts:\n\nOf the 51.5% of millennials who have credit card debt, 67.4% are stressed\n\nOf the 54.5% of Gen X who have credit card debt, 64.3% are stressed\n\nOf the 24.3% of millennials who have personal loans, 62% are stressed\n\nOf the 24.6% of Gen X who have personal loans, 62.5% are stressed\n\nOf the 28.4% of millennials who have undergraduate student-loan debt, 72.2% are stressed\n\nOf the 15.5% of Gen X who have undergraduate student-loan debt, 62.5% are stressed\n\nGen X is most stressed about credit card debt, while millennials are most stressed about student-loan debt. The latter is a particular problem \u2014 it's so stressful that nearly half of indebted respondents in both generations say taking out those loans for college wasn't worth it.\n\nRead more: Nearly half of indebted millennials say college wasn't worth it, and the reason why is obvious\n\nBut it's not just debt that's stressful \u2014 money is also a huge source of stress in a marriage.\n\nOf married millennials, nearly 64% say money causes some or a lot of stress with their partner. Nearly half of Gen X respondents say the same. For baby boomers, that percentage drops down to roughly 36%, highlighting a big generation gap.\n\nEven single people who date said money is a source of stress for them.\n\nGen X is feeling financially desperate\n\nIf Gen X's level of money stress indicates anything, it's that they are financially worse for the wear \u2014 at least, they think they are.\n\nWhen asked how they would rate their financial health, slightly more than 41% of Gen X said it's not very good or not good at all. That's worse than millennials, 37% of whom said the same. More of Gen X than the millennial generation also think their finances are much worse off somewhat worse off than their peers \u2014 about 43% compared to 36%.\n\nGen X is also less likely than millennials to think they earn more than their peers and more likely to think they earn less. Of Gen X respondents, half think they earn less than their peers \u2014 29% think they earn less and have less debt, while around 21% think they earn less and have more debt.\n\nRead more: Forget millennials \u2014 the real financial time bomb in America is Gen X\n\nMillennials are reading their own press\n\nMeanwhile, millennials think they're doing all right \u2014 at least, compared to their peers.\n\nMore millennials (around 46%) think their finances are somewhat or much better off than others in their generation than those who think they are somewhat or much worse off (36%). The remaining percentage said they didn't know or had no opinion.\n\nBut only 34% of millennials think they earn more money than their peers, versus the 44% who think they earn less than their peers (again, the remaining percentage said they don't know). But only 35% of millennials think they have more debt than their peers, while 48% think they have less debt.\n\nThese perceptions might be because millennials are reading their own press about their generation's financial woes \u2014 like how they're suffering from stagnant wages, struggling to afford staples like housing, and dealing with staggering student-loan debt.\n\nIf millennials are overall thinking they're doing better than their peers, the situation on the ground may be better than we believe. Though things may be rough for the generation, the fundamentals may not be as bad as the story they're told.\n\nRead more: The Great Recession created a domino effect of financial struggles for millennials \u2014 here are 5 ways it shaped the generation\n\nNo one's saving anything \u2014 and some just aren't worried about it\n\nMany millennials and Gen X aren't preparing for retirement.\n\nOnly half of Gen X said they had a 401(k) or retirement account \u2014 and 13% of Gen X said that they have an account, but aren't currently contributing to it. And 54% of millennials don't have a retirement account \u2014 but only 11% of millennials who have one aren't making monthly contributions.\n\nOf Gen X respondents who don't have a 401(k) or retirement account, about 70% said it was because they didn't have enough to save, while nearly half said it's because they're unemployed (respondents were allowed to select more than one reason). Fewer millennials without retirement accounts cited the same reasons \u2014 63% said it's because they don't have enough money, while 45% said it's because they're out of the labor force.\n\nAnd roughly one-third of each generation said they don't have one because they're just not worried about it.\n\nCheck back on \"The State of Our Money\" throughout the month for deeper findings and analysis.", "description": "Gen X has a negative outlook, while millennials think they're doing okay.
