Andy Biggs (R-AZ) announced that he will postpone the required vote on his motion to condemn and censure Rep. Adam Schiff (D-MA).\n\nOut of respect to Chairman Cummings & his family, I have decided to postpone the required vote on my motion to condemn & censure Adam Schiff.\n\n\n\nI expect a vote early next week.\n\n\n\nI sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi today on my condolences & decision to postpone the censure vote. pic.twitter.com/HTxvM2VuCE \u2014 Rep Andy Biggs (@RepAndyBiggsAZ) October 17, 2019\n\nIn the video released by Rep. Biggs today, the congressman expressed his condolences to the Cummings' family and friends and said he has asked Speaker Pelosi to postpone the vote on his motion out of respect for the Cummings' family.\n\nRep. Biggs said he has also asked Speaker Pelosi for an explanation as to why Rep. Schiff is continuing with his \"closed-door, soviet-like prosecution of this president, when it is Mr. Cummings' own committee that is part of that exploration.\" Rep. Biggs continued, \"I just don't understand why there's no warmth in the heart of Adam Schiff\" to similarly \"hold off\" on these \"impeachment depositions.\"\n\nRep. Schiff has come under fire from Republicans for embellishing the phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky during a hearing on Capitol Hill and for barring Republican members of Congress from participating in closed-door sessions related to the Democrats' impeachment efforts.\n\nMore than 160 representatives have co-sponsored Rep. Biggs' motion to condemn and censure Rep. Schiff.\n\nThe impeachment investigation has always been about politics and never about facts. Chairman Adam Schiff misled the American people on numerous occasions and that\u2019s why I cosponsored a resolution to condemn his behavior and censure him. \u2014 Markwayne Mullin (@RepMullin) October 16, 2019\n\nI stand with my fellow colleagues in calling for a House floor vote to censure and condemn Rep. Adam Schiff for his lies and fabrications to the American public. https://t.co/VMp8CibucQ \u2014 U.S. Representative Bill Flores (@RepBillFlores) October 16, 2019\n\nYesterday, I signed on to my friend @RepAndyBiggsAZ's motion to condemn and censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\n\n\nListen to him explain why: https://t.co/48YFkTmV1P \u2014 Rep.
