Armed with the papers, Democratic lawmakers say, they could better explore any conflicts of interest in the executive branch and whether the president has violated the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of speculation, but it seems that the accounting firm has tax returns and other documents that will show President Trump and his family and associates involved in all sorts of deals,\u201d Washington lawyer David Dorsen, who served as assistant chief counsel to the U.S. Senate\u2019s Watergate Committee in the 1970s, said in an interview. Lawmakers will want to know whether documents show \u201cpayoffs to people in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat would be an enormous, enormous factor in what\u2019s going on now,\u201d Dorsen said.\n\nRead More: Giuliani Ukraine Allies Arrested With One-Way Flight Tickets\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers could ask the full appeals court to consider the ruling, which might drag out the process, or go straight to the Supreme Court for an emergency review of the decision.\n\n\u201cWe are evaluating the opinion and reviewing all options, including appeals,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump.\n\nU.S. Circuit Court Judge Neomi Rao, who was named to the bench by Trump, dissented from the opinion by Tatel and Patricia Millett, both appointees of Democratic presidents. She said Congress can investigate allegations of illegal conduct against the president only as part of an impeachment process and not through its legislative power.\n\n\u201cAllowing the Committee to issue this subpoena for legislative purposes would turn Congress into a roving inquisition over a co-equal branch of government,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision is \u201ca travesty,\u201d said John Eastman, a professor at Chapman University\u2019s Fowler School of Law. He said he sees a committee chairman acting on a partisan mission and not a formal impeachment process, and said the ruling would have \u201clong-term repercussions on our constitutional separation of powers and basic notions of due process.\u201d\n\nEastman said an impeachment procedure requires a vote of the whole House and predicted that the Supreme Court would \u201cput the brakes on this, absent a formal initiation of an impeachment proceeding.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress has broad subpoena authority when acting pursuant to its legislative powers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this is Congress acting as prosecutor in an impeachment proceeding that has not been formally launched.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump, under siege from House Democrats weighing impeachment, suffered a stinging blow as a federal appeals court upheld a subpoena ordering his accountants to provide Congress with his financial records.The ruling, by a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals", "authors": ["Andrew Harris", "Bob Van Voris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TON5W3NstX2rn.bhKL4puQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/1fa98228a2738e2f172b05ea2fa4c971", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
