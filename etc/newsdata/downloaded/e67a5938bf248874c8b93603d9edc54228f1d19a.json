They\u2019re going to move polling places. They\u2019re going to do a whole variety of things, that, when we had a Voting Rights Act that was intact and a Justice Department that was concerned about it, we could prevent a lot of this stuff.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have those tools now,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve got to be prepared for a tough fight. But it\u2019s a fight that we can win.\u201d\n\nCo-host Charlamagne tha God went on to claim that Mr. Trump is going to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to stay in office so he can avoid possible prison time.\n\nMr. Holder agreed, saying he initially dismissed speculation that the president could refuse to leave the White House if he isn\u2019t reelected.\n\n\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018that\u2019s ridiculous.\u2019 But as I\u2019ve thought about it, this guy with all the norms he breaks through,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he loses, and then it will be interesting between, say, November and January when he would have to start packing. I wonder if, for instance, he will pardon himself? \u2026 Will he pardon all the people in his administration? \u2026 That\u2019s something that I wouldn\u2019t take off the table.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
