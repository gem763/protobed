If he had he wouldn't have taken this option. It is a disgrace.\n\nWe did not expect this to happen and feel the Government has stolen his savings. And more annoying, he contacted the Government a year previously and they advised him of the amount he would receive and again did NOT advise that he cannot have the money.\n\nLooking back at this time, I reckon the person at the state pension office was not familiar with the new ruling themselves, hence the reason he was not informed.\n\nIf possible could you please advise what we can do to make them pay up.\n\nSCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK YOUR PENSION QUESTION\n\nSteve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below\n\nSteve Webb replies: There was a major change to the state pension system on 6 April 2016 and part of that reform related to the rules around deferring your state pension.\n\nYour husband reached state pension age just a few days into the new regime and so the new rules apply to him.\n\nYour state pension age is before the change - you are younger, but women's state pension age was still lower then - and therefore the old rules applied to you.\n\nHow did the deferral rules affect you?\n\nUnder the old rules, you had two options if you chose to defer.\n\nOne option was to roll up all of the deferred payments as a lump sum (plus interest) which you are planning to do.\n\nThe other option was to take an enhanced state pension, with an extra 10.4 per cent on the pension for each year of deferral.\n\nThis additional rate was very attractive and means that most people will more than make up in retirement what they gave up by deferring.\n\nWhat are the new rules that affect your husband?\n\nFor those, such as your husband, who reached pension age under the new system, the option of a deferral lump sum has been abolished.\n\nThe only option now is to take an enhanced pension when it finally comes into payment. The rate of enhancement is now an extra 5.8 per cent for each year of deferral.\n\nAs you say, this means that your husband will recover the missed payments in full after about 17 years of retirement.\n\nThe official statistics say that the typical 65 year-old man can expect to live for 21 years, so should on average benefit, but obviously this depends on their state of health.\n\nI can see that it is slightly confusing that your husband has been allowed a lump sum payment of around \u00a38,000 (rather than no lump sum at all).\n\nWhat I assume has happened here is that the DWP have treated him *as if* he was making a late claim one year after his state pension age.\n\nBecause you can make a (non-deferred) claim up to a year after pension age and have it backdated, this first year's money can then be paid as a lump sum.\n\nThe balance of the deferred money has then been converted into an enhanced weekly state pension.\n\nWhat can you and your husband do now?\n\nI do understand your point that your husband had assumed he could do the same as you and claim a lump sum rather than receive an enhanced pension.\n\nI'm afraid there's no obvious way you can get the Department for Work and Pensions to pay a full lump sum as there's no legal basis for it to do so for those who reach pension age from 6 April 2016.\n\nYour best hope would be to make a complaint via your MP to the Parliamentary Ombudsman.\n\nThe Ombudsman looks at cases where people have suffered loss due to 'maladministration'.\n\nYou would have to demonstrate that DWP provided you with misleading information \u2013 perhaps sending you an out-of-date leaflet or (if you can prove this) giving you inaccurate information over the phone.\n\nYou can only complain to the Parliamentary Ombudsman if you have first exhausted the complaints process with the relevant Department and you would need to show that you had suffered loss as a result of their failure.\n\nYou can find more about the work of the Parliamentary Ombudsman here.", "description": "When he contacted the Government to stop the deferral and ask for the \u00a324,500 pot, he was advised he can only take \u00a38,000 and the balance will be split over future years at \u00a318 per week.", "authors": ["Steve Webb For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
