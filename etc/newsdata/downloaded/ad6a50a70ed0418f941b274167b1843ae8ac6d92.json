But Pelosi argued that she needed to protect the most vulnerable Democratic members of Congress \u2013 the ones who in 2018 won 40 Republican House seats, including many in districts where most voters solidly supported Trump in 2016 and likely still do.\n\nPelosi finally came around Tuesday. She did so after the most recent evidence of Trump asking the Ukrainian president to \u201clook into\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter regarding the younger Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and Joe Biden\u2019s role in the dismissal of a prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian company on whose board Hunter Biden served.\n\nPelosi spoke not long after several potentially vulnerable freshmen Democratic representatives announced their support for an impeachment investigation.\n\nDEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE, DESCRIBE CALL AS MAFIA-STYLE \u2018SHAKEDOWN\u2019\n\nPelosi has \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 behaved very much as the daughter of a politician (her father was a congressman and later mayor of Baltimore) would be expected to. She has stayed close to her base and shown she knows how to count votes. These are the same political skills she used to regain the speakership, even after presiding over the loss of a Democratic majority in the House.\n\nBut the impeachment target, President Trump, has historic political skills of his own. For all the talk of him being a first-time politician, he has skills honed from years of New York tabloid wars and reality television. That\u2019s no \u201cdiss.\u201d This is a man who knows how to create suspense and navigate a career doing summersaults on a trapeze without a net.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate a resume that reads: a hotshot real estate developer, a tabloid celebrity and casino operator who declared corporate bankruptcy and recovered; a reality TV star; a Democrat turned leading Republican; and now someone who rides in Air Force One and sits in the Oval Office.\n\nMany have enjoyed laughing at Donald Trump, but few have made money betting against him.\n\nPelosi knows how to play the inside political game \u2013 but Trump remains a master at the public art of politics.\n\nTo date, Trump has been effective at convincing enough Americans to oppose impeachment. A Fox News poll in July \u2013 just before now-former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress \u2013 showed that 45 percent of registered voters believed Trump should not be impeached, while 42 percent believed he should be impeached and removed from office. Another 5 percent believed Trump should be impeached but not removed.\n\nMany have enjoyed laughing at Donald Trump, but few have made money betting against him.\n\nThe recent revelation that Trump sought to get the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden \u2013 the president\u2019s potential 2020 reelection opponent \u2013 may change that, as could the House Democrats\u2019 decision to open an impeachment investigation. But it\u2019s equally likely that Americans will just move ever closer to their current polarized positions.\n\nMy advice on polls about impeachment: start paying attention next week, after this current news cycle has played out and we can gauge public reaction.\n\nIn the face of all this, here\u2019s a look at the strategy that each side is likely to play.\n\nPelosi and House Democrats have three goals in mind: keep their majority in the House, win the presidency, and see a Democratic majority in the Senate. They believe there is evidence against Trump \u2013 some of which the Trump administration has not been sharing \u2013 that either rises to the level of impeachment or at the least casts Trump in a very negative light.\n\nWhile some people argue that there is no way that a Republican-controlled Senate will find a two-thirds majority to convict and remove Trump from office, many Democrats may not care. They will find it strategically useful to have nonstop television news coverage of impeachment hearings about what they believe is evidence that will reflect negatively on the president.\n\nAnd while some Democrats say an impeachment investigation shouldn\u2019t interfere with the 2020 election, others will welcome the chance to have the investigation play out just as the election campaign is in full swing.\n\nAn alternative viewpoint is that Trump \u2013 in a way \u2013 welcomes the impeachment investigation. Those who hold this view believe it plays into the president\u2019s theme that he is fighting against a \u201cDeep State\u201d in order to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d\n\nLike President Bill Clinton (yes, Bill Clinton) and a champion bullfighter, Trump has shown himself to be most effective when his back is against the wall and everyone thinks he\u2019s about to fail.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDespite six corporate bankruptcies, multiple accusations of wrongdoing against him, a special counsel\u2019s investigation and daily attacks by Democrats and the media, Trump is still able to go thumbs-up behind the Resolute desk.\n\nFor those of us who refuse to underestimate Trump, the fact that he released a summary Wednesday of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and spoke to reporters with Zelensky after the two met at the United Nations suggests Trump might have something up his sleeve.\n\nTRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT: READ THE DOCUMENT\n\nThe summary shows that while Trump sought an investigation of Biden family dealings in Ukraine, there isn\u2019t a direct quote explicitly linking the request to U.S. aid.\n\nSpeaking to reporters alongside Trump, Zelensky said Wednesday that Trump did not pressure him to investigate the Biden family in the July 25 call.\n\n\u201cNobody pushed me,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cWe had a great phone call.\u201d\n\nRepublican senators \u2013 especially those up for reelection in 2020 \u2013 face a double bind. Polls universally show Trump with strong support among Republicans. As a result, if GOP senators attack Trump they open themselves to a threat of a Republican primary from that solid Trump base, or reduced turnout among Republicans in the general election.\n\nHowever, if Republican senators are too strongly associated with Trump and are seen as ignoring what many non-Republican voters see as his misconduct, the senators may find it difficult to win reelection in the battleground states of Arizona, Colorado, Maine, North Carolina and even Georgia. Republican senators seeking reelection in those states and others want the support of some independents and even moderate Democrats in November 2020.\n\nInterestingly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., came out in support of getting to the whistleblower complaint against President Trump regarding the call with Zelensky and apparently other issues released to Congress. McConnell\u2019s reasoning appears to be that if the news is going to be bad, get it out quickly so it can fade in the public mind by November 2020.\n\nFor the Democratic presidential hopefuls, the controversy over Ukraine and Biden is a bit of minefield.\n\nFor Biden, the whole affair seems to cast him the way he wants: he\u2019s the Democrat\u2019s best chance to be elected president because he\u2019s the guy Trump appears to fear most.\n\nOn the other hand, even though there doesn\u2019t appear to be anything to the accusation of improper conduct by the former vice president, it would not be the first time that Trump has forced the media to ask one of his adversaries the equivalent of \u201cWhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who was the first to come out in favor of the impeachment of Trump, may see some traction with her core message: See, I told you. And as with other things, you can trust me that I know what we need to do.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor the other Democratic presidential contenders \u2013 especially those whose campaigns are still struggling for attention \u2013 recent developments are actually bad news: the developments shift attention from their campaign and onto the battle over impeachment.\n\nOne thing is certain: the center ring of the political circus is going to be the outcome of the impeachment investigation of the president. And it\u2019s a fight between a master of outsized public spectacle and a master of hidden vote counting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ARNON MISHKIN", "description": "Pelosi knows how to play the inside political game \u2013 but Trump remains a master at the public art of politics.", "authors": ["Arnon Mishkin"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/25/694940094001_6089473879001_6089472849001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
