Even though I am just a small player I would love to contribute in any way.\u201d\n\nGamble, who in 2001 was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, is one of many displaced players following the demise of the six-team Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League in May.\n\nThe absence of the CWHL left the five-team, U.S.-based National Women\u2019s Hockey League as the only professional hockey option for women in North America.\n\nBut Gamble was among the more than 200 women\u2019s players who this year announced a boycott of any professional leagues in North America until they were given the resources that professional hockey demands and deserves.\n\nGamble, who does Type 1 diabetes research at a Toronto hospital, considers herself an \u201caverage Joe\u201d in hockey circles but knew she had to be a part of what she hopes will lead the way for a viable future for women\u2019s hockey.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about any of the 200 players,\u201d said Gamble. \u201cIt\u2019s about unifying together and having a synergy effect of creating a sustainable league so that the next generation of females can play in a league and do this as a career.\u201d\n\nGamble, who as a child dreamed of one day playing in the National Hockey League, grew up in New Brunswick where she said she played against boys until she was about 14-year-old because there was no girls\u2019 league.\n\nShe soon realized that not only was the NHL not an option for her but simply making a living as a female hockey player was also not in the cards, and she cannot stand the thought of other girls going through that same heartbreak.\n\n\u201cAs time went on in my career I realized that I couldn\u2019t make a career out of something that makes me really happy,\u201d said Gamble. \u201cThat was really frustrating and disheartening.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to see young ladies today where you see that sparkle in their eyes and that desire in their heart but the only platform at the moment that they can try to achieve is going to the Olympics and (the chances) are so insignificant based on numbers.\u201d\n\nGamble will not draw much attention this weekend given she will be among a group that includes Olympic gold medalists Marie-Philip Poulin, Brianne Jenner, Rebecca Johnston and Natalie Spooner, but for her it is not about recognition.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the next generation to go through the same things that we are doing,\u201d said Gable. \u201cThat is not progressive, that would just be a cyclone of repeating history.\u201d", "description": "Anissa Gamble is not a household name in ice hockey but is so passionate about forming a sustainable professional women's league that she put dental school on hold in a bid to pave the way for the next generation of girls.", "authors": ["Frank Pingue", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
