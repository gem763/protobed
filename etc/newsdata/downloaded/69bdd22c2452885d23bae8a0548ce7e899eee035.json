Perhaps, she says, it\u2019s because of her obsessive nature\n\nLynne Ramsay crash-lands on an armchair on the terrace \u2013 hair flying, skirts swirling \u2013 looking as though she has just been blown in from the sea. She was out late last night at some ritzy Venice film festival soiree or other. \u201cDancing with Joaquin,\u201d she says, scrunching her face in embarrassment. The upshot is that she is totally knackered today.\n\nNo one is going to begrudge the woman a night on the tiles. All the same, it feels weird to have the director \u2013 arguably the toughest, purest voice in modern British cinema \u2013 wafting around the photo-calls and champagne receptions like some glamorous social butterfly. Any festival competition that doesn\u2019t include a Lynne Ramsay picture feels, on some nagging, illogical level, like an opportunity missed.\n\nIt is now 20 years since Ramsay\u2019s debut picture, Ratcatcher, led us on its throat-catching child\u2019s eye tour of her native Glasgow; 15 since Morvern Callar proved that she was no flash in the pan. But since then, devotees have grown accustomed to waiting long years for the director to make contact. She has struggled to get some projects made; ruffled industry feathers by bailing out of others. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m a bit of a perfectionist,\u201d she shrugs, which is such a whopping understatement it almost makes me choke on my coffee.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch Lynne Ramsay\u2019s new short film, Brigitte\n\nWithout a feature to bring to this year\u2019s festival, Ramsay has come with a short film instead. It is a documentary study of the French portrait photographer Brigitte Lacombe, commissioned as part of Miu Miu\u2019s Women\u2019s Tales series. Ramsay\u2019s approach is typically curious and mercurial, crossing the line in both directions as the film shows her shooting Lacombe while Lacombe shoots her. Both women normally hate having their picture taken. Both have always loved making images of others.\n\n\u201cI asked her how many pictures she takes a day and she wouldn\u2019t tell me,\u201d Ramsay says. \u201cIt was so many that it was like she was embarrassed. It\u2019s like an addiction for her and I\u2019m a bit like that too. I get really into things, totally obsessed. They thought I was deaf when I was a kid because I was always totally off in my own little world.\u201d\n\nActually, she adds, she has known Lacombe for years. They first met in 2011, when Ramsay was in Cannes with her elegant adaptation of We Need to Talk About Kevin. They were hanging out together in Poland when Ramsay received word that Joaquin Phoenix had signed on to take the lead role of wonky, dangerous Joe in 2017\u2019s You Were Never Really Here, which meant that the project was finally up and running. I tell her that Phoenix\u2019s latest turn in Joker seems to carry trace elements of his collaboration with Ramsay and she nods and smiles to humour me. \u201cJoe\u2019s scarier,\u201d she says finally.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joaquin Phoenix in Ramsay\u2019s 2017 film You Were Never Really Here.

She was hard at work on a script, starved of human company. \u201cWriting\u2019s so hard,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone once said that it\u2019s basically like vomiting and then bending down to pick out the good bits. And I always want to keep my hand in shooting stuff. Being on set, shooting a film \u2013 that\u2019s the part of the process I love the most.\u201d\n\nWhich begs the obvious question: why isn\u2019t she doing more of it? Ramsay has made four features in two decades, each in their way a masterpiece. But right before meeting her, I run into Steven Soderbergh. And over that same period he has cranked out 23.\n\n\u201cWhy am I not making more?\u201d she says. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s all a money thing. Getting finance together can take a while. Getting everything right can take a lot of time.\u201d She grins. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m not a brilliant multitasker.\u201d\n\nFor years she nursed a desire to make a big metaphysical science-fiction movie, with a plot freely adapted from Moby-Dick. This strikes me as the perfect text for a director whose career has been a saga of prolonged deep dives and sudden, splashy reappearances. She still thinks she would like to do it, but probably not for the foreseeable future. She has yet to catch Ad Astra, James Gray\u2019s acclaimed space saga, starring Brad Pitt as an astronaut on an obsessive search for his father. But she suspects that it might have slightly stolen her thunder.\n\n\u201cEvery director has a labour-of-love project,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like Stanley Kubrick always wanting to do Napoleon. So maybe I\u2019ll make it when I\u2019m 80 or something. But Ad Astra does feel a wee bit close to home. So yeah, James Gray probably got there first.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kathleen McDermott and Samantha Morton in 2002\u2019s Morvern Callar.

Ramsay was scarred by her fractious experience during the US production of Jane Got a Gun, eventually jumping ship at the 11th hour in early 2013. Her marriage broke down; she went to live in Greece for four years. And she gave birth to a daughter, who is now about to start school. \u201cThat was probably the main thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to spend some time with my daughter.\u201d\n\nBut she is aware that life is short; she says she probably needs to get cracking. Over in Costa Rica, she had been working on an original idea. The script is now done; the financial situation looks hopeful. \u201cSo I hope to get up and running with another feature next year,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe even sooner. Because I would like to make more, I really would. And I\u2019ve actually got four or five ideas on the go, enough projects to last me the next 10 years.\u201d Her eyes have taken on a faraway cast. She says: \u201cMaybe this is going to be the most prolific time of my life.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Brigitte is available online now", "description": "She\u2019s one of the greatest voices of contemporary cinema, yet the Scottish director is far from prolific.
