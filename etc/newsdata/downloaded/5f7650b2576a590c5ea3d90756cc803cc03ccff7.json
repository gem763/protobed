Levin The University of North Carolina Press 240 pp., $30.00\n\nWithin this online community, the publication of Kevin M. Levin\u2019s excellent book, Searching for Black Confederates: The Civil War\u2019s Most Persistent Myth, is nothing less than a declaration of war. In the last several decades, Levin writes, a growing number of people have begun to accept as fact claims that between 500 and 100,000 black soldiers fought in racially integrated units in the Confederate Army. There are hundreds of web sites, legions of online communities, and whole books devoted to perpetuating these claims. Billboards reading \u201c75,000 Confederates of color?\u201d have recently appeared in Missouri, and one fourth-grade Virginia history textbook asserted that \u201cthousands of Southern blacks fought in Confederate ranks.\u201d Although it is difficult to measure the pervasiveness of this narrative, one study from 2013 found that 16 percent of students at a Virginia university believed that \u201cblacks fought for the Confederacy.\u201d\n\nYet, as Levin patiently explains, this is totally untrue\u2014predicated on a misreading and misunderstanding of historical documents, as well as outright lies and manipulations. The myth of black Confederates enables white supremacists to portray the Civil War inaccurately as a struggle over states\u2019 rights, not slavery; as a fight for Southern liberty, not for oppression. This in turn justifies their retrograde and racist politics in the present. To those who have embraced this myth, Levin\u2019s book is a terrifying prospect, and for good reason. Searching for Black Confederates is a bracing corrective, a slender yet vital volume in the growing library of texts dedicated to dispelling white supremacist talking points.\n\nThere were plenty of black men present in Confederate Army camps, and even on the gray side of Civil War battlefields. The Confederate Army pressed tens of thousands of slaves into work as teamsters, butchers, blacksmiths, ditchdiggers, and hospital attendants; thousands more were brought to war by their masters, for whom they performed less desirable labor and assisted with washing, sewing, and food preparation. Countless slaves used the excitement of war and the confusion of battle to flee. Many others stayed, some for years, sometimes even saving their masters\u2019 lives and nursing their wounds; they may have felt some sense of kinship with their masters, with whom they were now sharing close quarters and the intimacy of the trenches, but many undoubtedly remained because they had family still on their masters\u2019 homesteads, and they feared reprisals against their loved ones or the loss of the chance to reunite. As the war continued, the increasing flood of escapes led the Confederate Army to employ free blacks\u2014\u201cwho, it was believed, had fewer reasons to flee\u201d\u2014though only in \u201csupport roles.\u201d", "description": "Why the far-right pushes the lie that black Americans fought as Confederate soldiers", "authors": ["Scott W.
