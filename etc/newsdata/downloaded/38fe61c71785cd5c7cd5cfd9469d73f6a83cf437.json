I felt really patronised by that comment because having a disability people say that to us every day like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re so brave\u201d and I just felt that undermined everything I had done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was picked from 70,000 people and made it to the final 16 people. I felt very belittled and patronised and he has never said that to anyone before so I thought that was unfair.\u2019\n\nSouleyman dressed up like a turtle in their challenge (Picture: BBC)\n\nIt all came down to Riyonn Farsad, Lottie Lion and Souleyman Bah in the boardroom at the end of the task and Lord Sugar didn\u2019t hold back.\n\nThe Para-Olympian said he both felt confused and shocked that he got fired by Lord Sugar and that \u2018it shouldn\u2019t have been him\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018I thought I was the only one who had any sense in what was wrong with the product, it was an unfortunate case of \u201cI told you so\u201d although I can\u2019t tell them that because I am fired.\n\n\u2018I think what confused me was usually when you\u2019re fired, it\u2019s when you\u2019re the leader if the task and the reason the task failed was that the toy wasn\u2019t right for the demographic.\n\n\u2018We were told that all along, at our target audience meeting, by John Lewis and Hamley\u2019s Toy Shop. We were told it by everyone and I said that right from the beginning and no one chose to listen to me and that is why we failed.\u2019\n\nSouleyman went on to explain who he thought should have been fired instead of him.\n\nHe added: \u2018The people responsible for the toy was Thomas and his team because they made the toy, and Riyonn because he was the project manager.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He has made toys in the past but for some reason, he completely detached himself from the project and he just wanted to have fun on stage in front of the camera and that\u2019s unfortunately where I got picked on, despite me making credible points about the product.\n\n\u2018Tommy or Riyonn should have been fired because they were the ones put in charge.\u2019\n\nThe Apprentice continues Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
