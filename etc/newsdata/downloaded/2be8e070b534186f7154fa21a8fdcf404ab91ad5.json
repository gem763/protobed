This fell to 41% between 2016 to 2018.\n\nThe government says that value added tax (VAT) and company income tax have been on the increase since 2015.\n\nBut a UN report this year showed that in 2018, Nigeria's estimated VAT gap - the shortfall between potential and actual VAT collections - was one of the largest in Africa.\n\nVAT gap in selected African countries\n\nNigeria also says it is intensifying measures to collect tax from new revenue streams, such as online transactions. It has said it will ask banks to charge tax at 5% on online transactions, both domestic and international, from January 2020.\n\nA report this year by Oxford University's Oxford Martin School estimates that non-oil revenues have risen but adds that much of the gain has been wiped out by inflation and currency movements.\n\nHow does it compare globally?\n\nAccording to some estimates, Nigeria has one of the world's lowest ratios of tax to GDP.\n\nThat is the total amount of tax collected as a proportion of GDP - the value of the country's goods and services.\n\nIn 2016, it was at 6%, going by figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a grouping of the world's leading market economies.\n\nThat is the latest year for which data is available.\n\nThe tax-to-GDP ratio in South Africa was 29%, Ghana 18%, Egypt 15% and Kenya 18%, says the OECD.\n\nThe average for OECD members - which includes all the advanced economies - was 34%.\n\nNigeria's low tax take\n\nThe World Bank uses a slightly different measurement of tax take, which does not include most social security payments.\n\nThis puts Nigeria's tax-to-GDP ratio in 2016 lower at just 3.4%.\n\nIn 2017, the ratio did improve to 4.8%, according to figures provided to us by the Nigerian authorities.\n\nWe don't have a figure for 2018, but it is worth pointing out that 15% is the level which the World Bank says is necessary to achieve economic growth and poverty reduction.\n\nHow do you improve tax take?\n\nMany other developing countries have a low tax-to-GDP ratio and recent data indicates that about 60 countries fall below the 15% threshold.\n\nBernardin Akitoby, an assistant director in the IMF, says a typical advanced country has a tax to GDP ratio of around 40%.\n\nMr Akitoby says there is no one-size-fits-all solution to increase the tax take - but there are a few lessons that can be drawn from countries that have been successful in the past:\n\na clear political mandate to tackle low levels of tax payment\n\na simpler tax system with a limited number of rates and exemptions\n\nusing taxes on goods and services\n\nboosting tax collection by using new technology\n\nThe IMF says more comprehensive tax reform in Nigeria could help increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by about eight percentage points.", "description": "Nigeria says more people than ever are paying tax - but government revenues are not growing", "authors": ["Reality Check Team", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F9A6/production/_108601936_oil_platform.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
