According to sources, donors have in recent days called the Utah senator and encouraged him to run against Trump in the primary. \u201cThere is a half-billion dollars on the sidelines from guys who are fed up with Trump,\u201d a GOP donor told me. Their hopes were raised when Romney attacked Trump on Friday, tweeting: \u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d Former White House communications director turned Trump antagonist Anthony Scaramucci tweeted a poll showing Romney beating Trump 55% to 37% in a hypothetical primary. Trump fired back on Saturday. \u201cMitt Romney never knew how to win,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHe is a pompous \u2018ass\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him). He is so bad for R\u2019s!\u201d\n\nAccording to people close to Romney, he\u2019s firmly decided against primarying Trump, an enterprise he believes to be a sure loser given Trump\u2019s enduring GOP support. Romney has also told people that, as an unsuccessful two-time presidential candidate, he\u2019s the wrong person to take on Trump. Instead, a Romney adviser told me, Romney believes he has more potential power as a senator who will decide Trump\u2019s fate in an impeachment trial. \u201cHe could have tremendous influence in the impeachment process as the lone voice of conscience in the Republican caucus,\u201d the adviser said. In recent days, Romney has been reaching out privately to key players in the Republican resistance, according to a person briefed on the conversations. \u201cRomney is the one guy who could bring along Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Ben Sasse. Romney is the pressure point in the impeachment process. That\u2019s why the things he\u2019s saying are freaking Republicans out.\u201d (Romney, through a spokesperson, declined to comment.)", "description": "", "authors": ["Gabriel Sherman", "Vanityfair.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
