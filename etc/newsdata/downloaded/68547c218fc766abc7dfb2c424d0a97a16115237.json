At 1:55 p.m., the police said they had apprehended a suspect.\n\nBut according to worshippers inside the synagogue, the gunman might have taken the lives of 70 to 80 people who were inside if it weren't for a locked door.\n\n\"The perpetrator shot at the door several times and threw several Molotov cocktails, firecrackers, or grenades to try to get in. But the door stayed shut, God protected us,\" Max Privorozki, a spokesman for the Jewish community, told Der Spiegel. \"The whole thing took about five to 10 minutes.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with Stuttgarter Zeitung, Privorozki said they carried on with Yom Kippur worship as the gunman attempted to break in.\n\n\n\n\"We barricaded our doors from inside and waited for the police,\" he said. \"In between, we carried on with our service.\"\n\n\"We saw through the camera of our synagogue that a heavily armed perpetrator wearing a steel helmet and rifle was trying to shoot open our door.\"\n\n\"The man looked like he was from the special forces. But our doors held firm.\"\n\n\n\nOne of the gunman's victims, a man, was shot right outside the synagogue, and the other, a woman, was shot at a kebab shop nearby, the Halle police said.\n\nGerman Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said in the aftermath that the attack was anti-Semitic in nature and looked to have a far-right motive, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"According to what we now know we have to assume that it was at least an anti-Semitic attack,\" he said. \"According to the federal prosecutor there are sufficient indications for a possible right-wing extremist motive.\"\n\nAmong the 70 to 80 people in the synagogue were 10 American citizens, US ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell tweeted on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nDer Speigel reported the attacker is a 27-year-old man from Saxony-Anhalt, the state in which Halle lies. The man was detained after he was injured in a shootout with police. Police have not yet made his identity public, but Der Speigel identified him as \"Stephen B.\"\n\nThe shooter's father said in an exclusive interview with Bild newspaper on Thursday that his son \"was on the internet too much, I tried to get to him but never got through, he always blamed others and was very unhappy with the world.\"\n\nMore than 2,000 people watched a 35-minute livestream of the shooting on the streaming platform Twitch, before it was taken down.\n\nIn the video, which Insider has decided not to republish, the suspect swears when he can't get inside the temple, and is heard saying \"the root of all these problems is the Jew.\"\n\n\n\nInsider's Lauren Frias previously reported streaming platforms like Twitch have long struggled with how to manage the creation and spread of violent content.\n\nIn March of this year, the New Zealand shooter who gunned down 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch, used Facebook Live to stream his attack. It was later shared in dozens of Reddit groups, and posted on YouTube and Twitter.\n\nTwitch tweeted on Wednesday: \"Twitch has a zero-tolerance policy against hateful conduct, and any act of violence is taken extremely seriously. We worked with urgency to remove this content and will permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "A Jewish community leader said worshippers \"carried on with our service\" in Halle, while a camouflaged attacker attempted to blast down their door.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9459/d8ff081587b2454281d2ccdc59b0dd49.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
