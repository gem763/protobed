In this case, they're after my credit or debit card numbers.\n\nPhishing happens by text message too. Earlier this month HMRC reported people are nine times more likely to fall for text message scams than other types such as email because they can appear more legitimate, with many texts displaying \u2018HMRC\u2019 as the sender, rather than a phone number.\n\nIt also said it had 'stopped thousands of taxpayers from receiving scam text messages, with 90 per cent of the most convincing texts now halted before they reach their phones'.\n\nHere's an example message HMRC has published on its website as a warning.\n\nFake text: HMRC won't send you a text message about a tax refund either\n\nTo help you protect yourself and your bank account, there are several warning signs you should always look out for to determine whether such emails and texts are fakes.\n\nWARNING SIGNS TO LOOK FOR\n\nFirst of all, HMRC will NEVER email or text you to inform you of a tax refund (which is also refers to as a rebate). And it will NEVER ask for personal or payment information.\n\nHere's the full list of what HMRC says it will never do or ask you for over email or by text:\n\nnotify you of a tax rebate\n\noffer you a repayment\n\nask you to disclose personal information such as your full address, postcode, Unique Taxpayer Reference or details of your bank account\n\ngive a non HMRC personal email address to send a response to\n\nask for financial information such as specific figures or tax computations, unless you\u2019ve given us prior consent and you\u2019ve formally accepted the risks\n\nhave attachments, unless you\u2019ve given prior consent and you\u2019ve formally accepted the risks\n\nprovide a link to a secure log in page or a form asking for information - we\u2019ll ask you to log on to your online account to check for information instead.\n\nNext, make sure you carefully scrutinise the sender's email address.\n\nHMRC says: 'Look out for a sender\u2019s email address that is similar to, but not the same as, HMRC\u2019s email addresses. Fraudsters often have email accounts with HMRC or revenue names in them (such as \"refunds@hmrc.org.uk\"). These email addresses are used to mislead you.\n\n'However be aware, fraudsters can falsify (spoof) the \"from\" address to look like a legitimate HMRC address (for example \"@hmrc.gov.uk\").\n\n'If you\u2019re not 100 per cent sure that the message has come from us, don\u2019t open it. If you do open the email and you\u2019re in doubt don\u2019t click on any links or downloads.'\n\nThis is in case they contain malware - software with a virus that can read personal information on your computer \u2013 or destroy it. The bug is often activated by users inadvertently opening an attachment or clicking on an email link.\n\nAnd it's not just emails and texts about tax refunds you need to be vigilant towards.\n\nA spokesman for Action Fraud told This is Money: 'At this important time in the tax year when people will be claiming refunds, we are warning of fraudsters who contact victims claiming to be from HMRC to trick them into paying bogus debts and taxes.\n\n'These criminals will contact victims in many ways, including spoof calls, voicemails and text messages. And in most cases they will ask for payments in iTunes giftcards.\n\n'It is important that people spot the signs of this type of fraud to protect themselves.\n\n'HMRC will never use text messages to inform about a tax rebate or penalty and will never ask for any payment in the form of iTunes vouchers.'", "description": "If you've just paid your self-assessment tax bill, be vigilant if you receive an email informing you that you're due a refund.
