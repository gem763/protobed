The fossil fuels industry has gotten nearly every single last item on its wishlist from the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nStill, Taylor noted that energy company wins could be short-lived. \u201cGiven that most of these policy gifts were achieved via executive order or regulatory action, they can all be undone rather quickly by a Democratic administration.\u201d\n\nWhich helps explain why fossil fuel interests seem to be moving early and with gusto to fill Trump campaign coffers, on top of writing other big checks since Trump\u2019s election to outside groups that are promoting deregulatory agendas.\n\nBesides Murray and Miller, other early big Trump energy donors include Kelcy Warren who heads Energy Transfer, a Texas firm that constructed the controversial Dakota Access pipeline project which in early 2017 got a green light when the army approved a final permit for building it.\n\nWarren, who donated $300,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural, in the second quarter of 2019 chipped in the maximum $360,000 to Trump\u2019s Victory Committee, the joint fundraising effort of the campaign and the RNC, according to campaign filings.\n\nLikewise the oil and gas billionaire Harold Hamm, who is CEO of Continental Resources and touted Trump\u2019s credentials at the GOP convention in mid 2016, donated $50,000 in this year\u2019s second quarter to Trump\u2019s Victory Committee, according to public filings.\n\nHamm was also one of an elite group of fossil fuel CEOs who wrote big checks to both the inaugural and to outside Pacs that have been instrumental in backing Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda. Hamm and his company donated $1m to both the inaugural, and another $1m to one of several Pacs that have promoted Trump\u2019s energy policies.\n\nMurray and his eponymous Murray Energy, the nation\u2019s largest privately owned coal company, also has contributed $1m to a Pac that helps push Trump\u2019s energy agenda.\n\nAccording to a 2018 Public Citizen study, energy industry donors of at least $100,000 gave a total of $8.3m to six outside groups promoting Trump policies from early 2017 through mid-October last year, putting the energy sector right behind gambling and real estate as leading backers of Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nMurray, a prominent climate change denier who has ridiculed widely accepted climate change science as \u201ctheology\u201d and \u201cpolitics\u201d, gave the Trump administration a 14-point \u201caction plan\u201d on 1 March 2017 that included killing Obama\u2019s clean power regulations.\n\nMurray himself was at EPA headquarters in March 2017 when Trump signed an executive order telling the then EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, to start dismantling Obama\u2019s Clean Power plan.\n\nOther coal industry titans like billionaire Joe Craft, the CEO of the nation\u2019s third-largest coal company Alliance Resource Partners, have been riding high in the Trump era. Craft and his wife Kelly Knight Craft, both native Kentuckians with close ties to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, donated a total of $2m to Trump campaign coffers and the inaugural committee.\n\nKelly Craft was confirmed this summer to be US ambassador to the United Nations, becoming the first big donor to hold that post. Craft agreed to recuse herself from discussions about climate change and coal because of her husband\u2019s company.\n\nSome key Trump backers who lobby for fossil fuel clients are faring well too.\n\nMiller, the Texas lobbyist who rounded up $1m in just this year\u2019s second quarter for the Trump campaign, also served as a vice-finance chair of Trump\u2019s inaugural.\n\nBoasting a blue chip list of fossil fuel clients including Kelcy Warren\u2019s Energy Transfer Partners, Southern Company and Occidental Petroleum, Miller\u2019s firm has experienced a healthy uptick in clients since Trump\u2019s election.\n\nAnd Miller has reportedly met with the president on some energy issues, plus his old boss, energy secretary Perry. \u201cIf you want to get to Rick Perry, you go to Miller,\u201d said one veteran GOP Texas donor.\n\nDon Duncan, formerly ConocoPhillips\u2019 top lobbyist, notes that Trump pledges to drain Washington\u2019s influence swamps seem to have fizzled. \u201cTrump hasn\u2019t drained the swamp, he\u2019s just filled it with more alligators.\u201d", "description": "Lobbyists are giving millions to help Trump win in 2020, after reaping a regulatory windfall that benefited their bottom lines", "authors": ["Peter Stone"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7780016432d5b2454622905b8ab79437384c4e55/0_135_2097_1258/master/2097.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e8ba4724102023e52cd694d4a18078b4", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
