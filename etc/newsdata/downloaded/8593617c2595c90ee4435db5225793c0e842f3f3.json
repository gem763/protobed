Boizot, who took on the lease of a struggling Soho joint called PizzaExpress in 1965, was a true pathfinder, twigging how this humble Neapolitan foodstuff could be made the basis of a contemporary, cosmopolitan and even mildly swinging dining experience, a groovy cavalcade of primary colours, Paolozzi murals and \u2013 God help us \u2013 live jazz.\n\nAs his empire grew, he kept things simple and at least vaguely authentic (no ham and pineapple), establishing the first \u2013 though by no means last \u2013 \u201cgood chain\u201d, somewhere you could take the kids or go \u00e0 deux after a subtitled film, somewhere (once it had outspread the capital) that might catch your eye if you were in an unfamiliar town, looking for lunch the day after a wedding, say.\n\nBut during the past decade and more, a tsunami of innovation \u2013 be it rival and more aggressively authentocratic pizzerias such as Franco Manca, or the broader phenomenon of sharp, focused \u201ccasual dining\u201d chains, your Wahacas and Busaba Eathais \u2013 have left the PE formula looking a little soggy (though Boizot stepped back from the business by this time). This seemed like a good moment to raise a glass of house red to Boizot\u2019s memory, and maybe just gently take stock of his legacy.", "description": "This review was first published in January, 2019, and has been republished.", "authors": ["Keith Miller"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2019/01/21/TELEMMGLPICT000185843798-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqjkbcL2dBx0qgwlodIGgQEPhS7T6b0WMc8oObiASvqYk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-01-21"}
