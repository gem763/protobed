During its 2 1 / 2 -year run, Cream sold millions of records and released a run of bluesy, jazzy and psychedelic hits including \u201cWhite Room,\u201d \u201cSunshine of Your Love\u201d and \u201cTales of Brave Ulysses\u201d in addition to rock-driven versions of blues standards such as \u201cCrossroads\u201d and \u201cSpoonful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClapton\u2019s guitar work was virtuosic, Bruce provided a propulsive bass line, and Mr. Baker was widely acknowledged as rock drumming\u2019s first colossus, as mesmerizing a showman as any preening lead singer or flamboyant guitarist.\n\nOften behind a parapet of drums, Mr. Baker\u2019s Mephistophelean stage presence, combined with his remarkably tasteful drumming, elevated the rock drummer from faceless metronome to percussive demigod.\n\nHis penchant for rhythmic innovation reached an apogee when he authored what many deem rock\u2019s first epic drum solo, in Cream\u2019s 1966 instrumental \u201cToad.\u201d It was an explosion of polyrhythmic lightning, with sustained fury, lightness and clarity.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHis playing was revolutionary \u2014 extrovert, primal and inventive,\u201d Rush drummer Neil Peart once told the London Independent. \u201cHe set the bar for what rock drumming could be. I certainly emulated Ginger\u2019s approaches to rhythm \u2014 his hard, flat, percussive sound was very innovative. Everyone who came after built on that foundation. Every rock drummer since has been influenced in some way by Ginger, even if they don\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Baker professed reverence for jazz drummers Elvin Jones, Art Blakey and Max Roach, and that informed his unerring sense of complex rhythm. But he was often reviled for his cantankerous belligerence on and off stage, and eruptions at his bandmates hastened Cream\u2019s dissolution.\n\nAddicted to heroin at a young age, the often cadaverously gaunt drummer became infamous for his near-sadistic behavior with his fellow musicians (he once pulled a knife on Bruce) and for going through projects and collaborators like so many disposable tissues.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Baker\u2019s drug-fueled, profanity-laced rages, all spewed in his back-alley Cockney brogue \u2014 along with his weaponized disdain for many of rock\u2019s most successful artists \u2014 eventually burned every artistic bridge formed during his musical heyday. He dubbed Mick Jagger a \u201cmusical moron.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Baker squandering several fortunes on polo ponies, and his misadventures were too numerous to be catalogued. They included reckless gunplay, run-ins with tax and immigration authorities, personal bankruptcy, and fractured relationships with three ex-wives and his three children. All of these incidents dogged Mr. Baker in a peripatetic life that had him constantly bouncing between England, the United States, Europe and Africa.\n\nHis picaresque lifestyle \u2014 and rampant ego \u2014 were summed up in the title of his autobiography: \u201cGinger Baker: Hellraiser (The Autobiography of the World\u2019s Greatest Drummer).\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere was perhaps no more accurate, and recent, portrayal of his lifelong highs and lows than the 2012 documentary \u201cBeware of Mr. Baker.\u201d He is alternately shown lovingly nuzzling his favorite polo horses and angrily smacking with his cane the film\u2019s director, Jay Bulger.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough the film presents a series of Baker hosannas offered by such modern-day drum masters as Stewart Copeland of the Police, a dyspeptic Mr. Baker is shown virtually immobile in a lounge chair, sucking on a morphine inhaler and scarfing pills to combat his degenerative osteoporosis.\n\n\u201cMy initial attraction to Ginger was figuring out what happens when you live by your own rules without compromise, artistically, spiritually, socially,\u201d Bulger told the New York Times. \u201cHere\u2019s what happens: You wind up alone at the end of the world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPeter Edward Baker \u2014 nicknamed \u201cGinger\u201d for his shock of flaming red hair \u2014 was born in the hardscrabble hamlet of Lewisham, England, on Aug. 19, 1939. His mother earned some money in a tobacco shop, while his father eked out a living as a bricklayer.\n\nMr. Baker was 4 when his father, conscripted into the military, was among the casualties in the Allies\u2019 disastrous World War II campaign to capture the strategic Dodecanese islands in the Aegean Sea. He later blamed the loss of his father on \u201cthat stupid sod Churchill.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAn indifferent student, he focused his energies on cycling and eventually music. Mr. Baker had become obsessed with the drums after he discovered he had what he often termed \u201ctime,\u201d or innate rhythm.\n\nAD\n\nHis immersion into jazz began when he shoplifted a copy of \u201cJazz at Massey Hall,\u201d a bebop recording featuring Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, among other masters. \u201cIt turned my life upside down,\u201d Mr. Baker later said of that landmark recording.\n\nBy 16, Mr. Baker had quit school and began his first tours with local jazz acts, soon becoming one of London\u2019s more highly sought jazz drummers. His greatest mentor was Phil Seamen, a drumming wizard who introduced him to African drumming and heroin.\n\nIn 1962, Mr. Baker joined one of the era\u2019s great blues bands, Alexis Korner\u2019s Blues Incorporated, replacing Charlie Watts. \u201cCharlie told me he didn\u2019t want to be a musician, that there wasn\u2019t any security in it,\u201d Mr. Baker later told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cA short time later, Mick and Brian [Jones] said they were forming a band and needed a drummer. I recommended Charlie.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFollowing a stint with the Graham Bond Organization, which also included Bruce, he helped start Cream, the ultimate platform for Mr. Baker\u2019s amalgam of drumming: part rock bombast, part jazz\u2019s seductive swing, and all the vital propellant for Cream\u2019s psychedelic blues-rock jams.\n\nAfter Cream broke up, Mr. Baker was left with a lifelong level of bitterness over how little actual writing and publishing credit \u2014 and commensurate royalty compensation \u2014 he received for his work. That constant omission, Mr. Baker often lamented, contributed to his chronic money troubles.\n\nAs Cream was imploding, Clapton formed his next supergroup, Blind Faith, with bassist Ric Grech and singer Stevie Winwood, and Mr. Baker attached himself uninvited. Clapton was wary, given the drummer\u2019s dark history with drugs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI took one look at his eyes and was sure he was back on it,\u201d Clapton wrote in his autobiography. \u201cI felt that I was stepping back into the nightmare that had been part of Cream.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBlind Faith folded in 1969, and Mr. Baker relocated to Nigeria the next year, swept up by the Afro-beat fervor. His journey to Nigeria, in a Range Rover, was documented in the 1971 film \u201cGinger Baker in Africa.\u201d\n\nMr. Baker settled in Lagos for six years, and it was there that he developed a passion for polo. He also invested his life\u2019s savings in West Africa\u2019s first 16-track studio. There, he jammed and recorded with Nigerian musician and activist Fela Kuti, widely recognized as Afro-beat\u2019s principal pioneer.\n\nBy 1982, Mr. Baker\u2019s career was spiraling downward thanks to his gnawing drug addiction, plus run-ins with the British government over taxes. He exiled himself to a small town in southern Italy where he toiled on an olive farm before popping up in Los Angeles a few years later with the impulse to become an actor.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1993, Cream was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. That imprimatur of success did not resolve Mr. Baker\u2019s wanderlust, or his legal and tax woes, and he eventually settled for many years on a South African polo ranch. \u201cBeware of Mr. Baker\u201d takes its name from a sign he hung near the entrance.\n\nHis first marriage was to Liz Finch, with whom he had three children. That and later marriages to Sarah Baker and Karen Loucks ended in divorce. In 2010, he married Kudzai Machokoto, a Zimbabwean nurse.\n\nFor Mr. Baker, Cream forever bestowed on him a label he abhorred: \u201crock drummer.\u201d He saw himself foremost as a jazz drummer, with rock as one of his many facets. And yet, he combatively reserved for himself the superlative of greatest rock drummer, unbeatable even with constant, self-inflicted health setbacks.\n\n\u201cWhen people put drummers like John Bonham, Mitch Mitchell and Keith Moon in the same bag as me, it\u2019s really insulting,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cI have a gift, and none of them is even on the same street as me. The fact that I can still play is a miracle, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries", "description": "The prodigiously talented and volcanically temperamental percussionist was as mesmerizing a showman as any preening lead singer or flamboyant guitarist.", "authors": ["Andrew Marton"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2g7YLwwSUiEexXzGjwgXp4QZD30=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OBZL6LXIFEI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
