It cannot get encrypted messages and attachments.\"\n\nA BBC investigation earlier this year found that encrypted apps were taking over from the dark web as a place to host criminals.", "description": "Priti Patel says extra security in messages will hamper attempts to fight terrorism and child abuse.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16543/production/_109095419_b1c4e6fb-ed53-466c-b359-77a66014ac66.jpg"}
