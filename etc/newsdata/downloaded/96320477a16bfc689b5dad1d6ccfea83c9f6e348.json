Some of them were still working at Fox, some of them really didn't want their names out there and so, as a team, we've really decided to protect our sources.\"\n\nTheron revealed, however, that she not spoken to Kelly herself but is \"really hoping that she'll see it.\"\n\nEarly reactions from critics that saw the film have suggested potential award success for the cast, particularly Theron and Robbie.\n\n(Image: Lionsgate UK)\n\nOne early viewer wrote on Twitter : \"Margot Robbie crashes into the Best Supporting Actress race with a devastating performance, descending from wide-eyed optimism to broken victim masterfully.

Well, she just entered the Oscar race big time. #bombshell \"\n\nFinally, another said: \"Good lord #Bombshell is fantastic \u2014 juicy, heartbreaking, funny and infuriating.
