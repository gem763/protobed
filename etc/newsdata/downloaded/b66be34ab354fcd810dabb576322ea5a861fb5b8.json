And it\u2019s going to go down in history,' he boasted with little hint of remorse.\n\nSince the show was filmed Yanis refused to confirm the status of his relationship with Shanise, or if they still planned on getting hitched.\n\nYanis and Shanise (pictured), from Birmingham, were the first couple in history to appear on Don't Tell The Bride and have their wedding called off for not following the rules\n\nSpeaking to Metro.co.uk about the episode which saw producers uncover the couple's deceit, by communicating about the details and location of the wedding.\n\n'It\u2019s quite legendary. Quite idiotic, but in some ways, I do feel like a legend.'\n\nHe explained: 'I got that tingling feeling from the offset. As soon as I got to [mother-in-law] Chantelle\u2019s house and I saw the cameras and the amount of people involved. I was like this is too much for a bridesmaid reveal.'\n\n'I knew at that point that chances are [the wedding is] coming to an end now.'\n\nThe couple appeared on Sunday's episode of the E4 show, which leaves the groom in charge of planning the big day - with no help or interaction from the bride.\n\nHowever, after Shanise's friend let slip she knew the pair were getting hitched in Paris, producers became suspicious and discovered that the bride-to-be had been going through her fianc\u00e9's emails to find information about the wedding.\n\nThe distraught bride-to-be broke down in tears and was comforted by friend and bridesmaid, Melissa (pictured together)\n\nThe couple were supposed to be getting married in Paris, as Yanis had booked them flights to the French capital\n\nProducers were forced to confront the groom and told him they'd have to cancel the entire wedding for the first time in the show's history - as their 'secret was out.'\n\nYanis had planned to wed his bride in Paris before flying back to Birmingham for the reception - with their budget only stretching to pay for 13 guests to travel to the ceremony.\n\nThe groom decided that Shanise's ten-year-old brother Chris wasn't a priority guest and would only attend the reception.\n\nHowever, Yanis appeared to have a very sudden change of heart - leading the producers to initially become suspicious.\n\nThen when bridesmaid Melissa was told that she no longer would be attending, she let slip that the flights were booked to Paris.\n\nThe bridal party knew they would be travelling abroad, but they were supposed to have no idea where they were going - leading the producers to conclude Yanis and Shanise had been communicating via email.\n\nAfter discovering the couple were over budget, Shanise (pictured) asked whether guests would be able to pay for themselves to fly abroad\n\nYanis (pictured) then had to call his fianc\u00e9 and tell her they would no longer be getting married due to the rule-breaking\n\nThe bridesmaids later visited Yanis' house for what they thought was their dress fitting, however, they were stopped by producers mid-way through their chat.\n\nThe show's producer said: 'Okay guys I'm going stop you there. We normally would do a bridesmaids reveal but it's come to our attention that the secret appears to be out and the bridal party know about some of the plans for the wedding.'\n\nAfter asking Yanis how the pair were communicating, he confessed: 'Shanise got access to my iPad with my emails in there. So technically the bride wasn't told she found out through email.'\n\nAfter storming off into the kitchen Yanis gathered himself and told Shanise the bad news on the phone: 'It's not good...It's not going ahead', he said.\n\nShanise was left 'heartbroken' when she was told over the phone by her husband-to-be that there would be no wedding\n\nShanise, in disbelief, asked: 'What the hell - what happens now? I need to know - is there a wedding or not?'\n\nShe was then left in tears after being told by producers: 'I know this is difficult but the rules have been broken and we are going to have to cancel this wedding.'\n\nA week later, the couple reflected on their time on the show and confessed they were 'heartbroken' and had found it hard to 'cope' with the aftermath of breaking the rules.", "description": "A groom who broke the rules on Don't Tell the Bride by communicating with the bridal party has shown little remorse for his actions and is yet to confirm whether he's still with his fiance.", "authors": ["Natalie Corner For Mailonline", "Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/12/19359266-0-image-a-11_1570359972650.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
