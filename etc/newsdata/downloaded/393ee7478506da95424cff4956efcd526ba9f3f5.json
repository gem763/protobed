Roy Blunt, Missouri Republican, on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president loves to go out on the White House drive-by \u2014 I haven\u2019t talked to him about this, I don\u2019t know what the president was thinking. But I do know he loves to bait the press, and he does that almost every day to see what you\u2019ll talk about,\u201d Mr. Blunt said.\n\nAsked whether it was appropriate to ask a foreign government to interfere with a U.S. election, Mr. Blunt replied, \u201cI don\u2019t imagine that\u2019s what he was doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly we shouldn\u2019t expect the Chinese, the Russians or any of our national security adversaries to be helpful in any way, and if they do come forward with information, I think you\u2019d have to seriously question whether there was any veracity with that information or not,\u201d Mr. Blunt said.\n\nAsked whether Mr. Trump\u2019s request was appropriate, Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, answered with a question of his own: \u201cYou really think he was serious about thinking that China\u2019s going to investigate the Biden family?\u201d\n\nMr. Jordan pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s crackdown on China, including the White House\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods and efforts to stop the theft of U.S. intellectual property.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s getting the press all spun up about this,\u201d Mr. Jordan told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cRemember, this is the president who\u2019s been tougher on China than any other president.\u201d\n\nHe also cited the Friday response by Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, who told reporters that the president was not making a \u201creal request,\u201d but rather \u201cneedling the press, knowing that you guys were going to get outraged by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he did it to dig you guys. I think he did it to provoke you to ask me and others and get outraged by it,\u201d said Mr. Rubio, a staunch critic of Chinese human rights abuses. \u201cHe plays it like a violin and everyone falls right into it. That\u2019s not a real request.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats launched last month an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden over his son Hunter Biden\u2019s receiving a seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company despite having no apparent qualifications.\n\nHunter Biden also owns a stake in the Chinese government-backed Bohai Harvest Equity Investment Fund, and has been accused of leveraging his relationship with the then-vice president to benefit the company, something Joe Biden denies.\n\nIn comments to reporters Thursday, Mr. Trump reiterated that he thought Ukraine should launch a \u201cmajor investigation\u201d into the Bidens.\n\n\u201cAnd, by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nOther Republicans, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s China remarks.\n\n\u201cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent,\u201d Ms. Collins told reporters, as reported by the Bangor Daily News. \u201cIt\u2019s completely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
