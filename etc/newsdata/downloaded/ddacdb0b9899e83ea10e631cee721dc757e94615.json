Was Trump simply the first explorer daring enough to discover a novel route to power? Or is this an extremely risky passage, safe to travel only under unusual circumstances, and otherwise a dead end?\n\nI\u2019d argue the latter, though of course I \u2014 effete #NeverTrumper \u2014 can be expected to say nothing else. But even his most ardent supporters ought to recognize that superpowers can make one a villain as often as a hero, and that this particular superpower is at the very least risky for them.\n\nBecause if the waters turn stormy and the public rebels \u2014 if polls suggest we\u2019re looking at a Democratic president and a filibuster-proof Democratic majority in the Senate \u2014 then the day will come when even many of Trump\u2019s supporters want him to stage a strategic withdrawal. And on that day, they\u2019ll discover that he pays exactly as little heed to his followers as he does to anyone else who is not named \u201cTrump.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Megan Mcardle", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions One-Day-Trump-Superpower-His-Shameless-Self-Regard-May-Fail-Him"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
