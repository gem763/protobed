She went on to become ABC\u2019s chief congressional analyst.\n\nNPR President Jarl Mohn called the Emmy Award winner one of NPR\u2019s \u201cfounding mothers\u201d in a statement, describing her as \u201cthe trusted voice that Americans count on when political news breaks.\u201d\n\nShe was born Mary Martha Corinne Morrison Claiborne Boggs on Dec. 27, 1943, to a prominent political family in Louisiana. She got her nickname Cokie from her brother, who struggled to pronounce \u201cCorinne\u201d when they were children.\n\nHer father, Hale Boggs, was a major force in New Orleans Democratic politics who served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 25 years and became majority leader in the early 1970s when his party ran the chamber. After his plane disappeared over Alaska in October 1972, her mother, Lindy Boggs, was elected to his seat and served through the end of 1990.\n\nRoberts rose to prominence at a time when broadcast news and political analysis were mostly presented by men. Along with NPR colleagues Nina Totenberg, Linda Wertheimer and Susan Stamberg, she helped shape the sound and culture of the public broadcaster.\n\nTwo of Roberts\u2019 journalistic subjects, former U.S. President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura Bush, noted her drive and humor in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cShe covered us for decades as a talented, tough, and fair reporter,\u201d their statement said. \u201cShe became a friend.\u201d\n\n\u2018LIVING LEGEND\u2019\n\nShe and her husband, the journalist Steven Roberts, collaborated on a syndicated column that ran in newspapers across the country.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, they wrote a column calling on the \u201crational wing\u201d of the Republican Party to stop then-candidate Donald Trump from becoming its nominee for president.\n\n\u201cShe never treated me nicely,\u201d Trump told reporters on Tuesday aboard Air Force One. \u201cBut I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional and I respect professionals.\u201d\n\nRoberts won numerous awards for her work, including three Emmys, U.S. television\u2019s top award. In 2008, the Library of Congress recognized her as a \u201cLiving Legend.\u201d\n\nRoberts wrote several books about overlooked women in American political history, including \u201cFounding Mothers,\u201d about the wives and other female relatives of the men who helped create the American republic. Her last book, published in 2015, was \u201cCapital Dames: the Civil War and the Women of Washington, 1848-1868.\u201d\n\nU.S. journalist Cokie Roberts poses in an undated handout photo obtained by Reuters on September 17, 2019.

NO ARCHIVES\n\nShe often spoke of women as playing a civilizing role in society.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t just see this role of women as caretakers in the world that I cover, I see it in the world I live in,\u201d she said in her commencement speech at Wellesley College, her alma mater, in 1994. \u201cSlowly, slowly, slowly but definitely, the workplace is becoming a more humane place because of the presence of women.\u201d\n\nShe is survived by her husband of 53 years and by two children and six grandchildren, her family said in a statement.", "description": "U.S. journalist Cokie Roberts, regarded by National Public Radio as one of its \"founding mothers\" and a prominent political commentator on ABC News, died on Tuesday at 75 at her Washington home from complications of breast cancer, her family said.", "authors": ["Peter Szekely", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1431006840&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G208", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
