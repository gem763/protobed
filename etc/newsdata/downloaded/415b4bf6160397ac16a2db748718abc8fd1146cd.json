I can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s just having some fun at our expense.\n\nGBPUSD Daily Chart\n\nGBPUSD Daily Chart\n\nWith talk already appearing of emergency EU summits, I\u2019m not optimistic that this week\u2019s EU council meeting is going to end in smiles and handshakes. With Boris\u2019 hands seemingly tied though, how the next days and weeks play out is difficult to predict but let\u2019s face it, when have these things ever been straightforward?\n\nPredictably, there wasn\u2019t much interest in the UK data this morning. Unemployment in the UK ticked higher while earnings growth slipped slightly to, a still very healthy, 3.8%. Meanwhile, sterling traders shrugged and went back to monitoring their Brexit headline ticker in the hope that more unnamed sources had juicy Brussels gossip. Ultimately, unless the data changes dramatically, it\u2019s borderline irrelevant compared to Brexit negotiations.\n\nGold vulnerable as risk appetite improves\n\nis higher for a second day but I don\u2019t think bulls will be jumping for joy. Gains have been very modest and the yellow metal continues to look very vulnerable to further declines after $1,480 once again came under pressure late last week. Doubts over the U.S.-China trade agreement have dragged a little on sentiment which has lifted gold markets.\n\nUltimately though, while traders weren\u2019t impressed by the lack of consistency in the messaging from both sides, it does still look like something will be signed before the year is out that will de-escalate the trade war for the first time. The details will be key though.\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nOil closely monitoring trade talks\n\nare coming off a little after being lifted by Friday\u2019s trade announcement. The global growth outlook is the clear primary driver in oil markets at the moment, despite the occasional geopolitical distractions that cause temporarily spikes. That may be complacent, but if we\u2019re heading for recessions in some major economies, that will have a significant impact on the demand outlook in a market that is already oversupplied. WTI has held around $50.50-51.50 whenever tested this summer and remains the key level here.\n\nWTI Daily Chart\n\nWTI Daily Chart\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by MarketPulse (Craig Erlam) covering: GBP/USD, XAU/USD, Gold Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
