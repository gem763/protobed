USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 On the court, Brandon Ingram seems more assertive. Off the court, he seems more talkative.\n\nIt reflects the growth Ingram has shown entering his fourth NBA season. It captures the perspective he gained amid three mixed years with the Los Angeles Lakers, getting traded to the New Orleans Pelicans and staying sidelined for seven months after doctors discovered a blood clot in his right arm. And it captures his mindset as the Pelicans try to navigate the beginning of the 2019-20 season while rookie Zion Williamson stays sidelined with an injured right knee.\n\nSo when the Pelicans finished with a 126-123 loss to the Houston Rockets on Saturday at Toyota Center, Ingram did not boast about his 35-point performance on 14-of-22 shooting, along with 15 rebounds and five assists. Instead, Ingram sounded more determined to ensure the Pelicans rectify their 0-3 start before Williamson\u2019s expected return in five to seven weeks.\n\n\"When we lose like this, I\u2019ll take it the hardest,\" Ingram told USA TODAY Sports. \"I know I can score the basketball and I can make plays for my team. So I definitely take it the hardest.\"\n\n.@B_Ingram13 the first 3 games of the season:\n\n\n\n27.3 PTS\n\n9.3 REB\n\n4.3 AST\n\n3.3 3PM\n\n1.7 BLK\n\n\n\nOne point shy of a career-high tonight against Houston. pic.twitter.com/kz5hdZrQXI \u2014 New Orleans Pelicans (@PelicansNBA) October 27, 2019\n\nGranted, the Pelicans are all trying to shoulder a bigger load amid Williamson\u2019s absence and Jrue Holiday missing Saturday\u2019s game because of a sprained left knee. Josh Hart started in Holiday\u2019s place and defended Rockets star James Harden, who had 29 points albeit on a 8-of-29 shooting clip. Pelicans third-year guard Lonzo Ball also showed an improved shot (18 points on 6-of-13 shooting) and crafty play-making (10 assists).\n\nRECORD BOOK: Russ passes Magic for second-most triple-doubles\n\nBut Ingram has willingly shouldered most of the burden to ensure the Pelicans do not suddenly morph from a possible playoff contender into an NBA lottery team. After opening the season with 25 points and five rebounds in an eight-point overtime loss to the Toronto Raptors, Ingram increased his totals in a seven-point loss to Dallas to 25 points and eight rebounds. Despite finishing one point shy of his career high, Ingram criticized himself for missing two layups and shooting 3-of-5 from the free-throw line. Perhaps a 40-point performance awaits soon.\n\n\"He plays like he has a chip on his shoulder,\" Hart observed about Ingram. \"That\u2019s when those kind of guys are dangerous. Today was a small sample of what he can do.\"\n\nWhat has fueled Ingram to have this chip? Well, a few things.\n\nOne, Ingram missed a combined 30 games last season after the Lakers\u2019 doctors discovered in early March that he had a blood clot known as deep venous thrombosis.\n\nTo Ingram\u2019s relief, he did not receive a life-threatening diagnosis. Nor did doctors believe it could end his NBA career as is it did to former forward Chris Bosh following his 13th season. Still, Ingram needed to have surgery to remove a rib, strengthen his back muscles and improve his posture to ensure the passage of his veins opened up. Following surgery, Ingram reported that both arms felt \"super weak\" and he remained immobile for almost a month. He waited another four months before beginning physical therapy. Ingram only began working out about a month before training camp started.\n\n\"I was away from the basketball game for so long. When I play it now, I just like to take advantage of it,\" Ingram said. \"That was a crazy process for me. So when I step out on the floor, it\u2019s just fun for me.\"\n\nMORE THAN A 6TH MAN: Lou Williams will help give Clippers a Big 3\n\nSecondly, Ingram echoes team accounts that portray him as feeling more relieved than sad that the Lakers included him in the trade package for Anthony Davis shortly before the draft in June.\n\nEver since selecting Ingram second overall in 2016, he intrigued the Lakers with his perimeter scoring, wing defense and work ethic. He also became one of 12 NBA players last season to average at least 18 points while shooting 49% from the field with five rebounds. Still, Ingram has sparked questions around the league about his 6-9, 190-pound frame, his durability and if he can ever morph into an All-Star. It did not help that the Lakers felt Ingram and LeBron James often got in each other\u2019s way.\n\nAs much as Ingram pledged \"not to listen to the outside noise,\" that noise became increasingly louder. The Lakers included most of their young roster in discussions with the Pelicans about Davis before the trade deadline. The Lakers eventually dealt Ingram, Ball, Hart and three draft picks, while keeping third-year forward Kyle Kuzma. Ingram is also in the fourth and final year of his contract before becoming a restricted free agent next summer.\n\nIF NOT ZION: Five who could steal Rookie of the Year with Williamson out\n\n\"I would say this is a better environment,\" Ingram said. \"There are a lot of genuine people here that are pretty solid. No shame to the Lakers because they are a high-class organization. They do everything well and have a good fan base. But I like this spot better.\"\n\nTherefore, Ingram pledged to stay determined through the Pelicans\u2019 early losing streak without Williamson with the same approach he took through a health scare and persistent trade rumors.\n\n\"He\u2019s a better all-around player because he\u2019s worked at it,\" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. \"He\u2019s done a good job at working on his game and working on his craft and getting better at it.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "Brandon Ingram says the Pelicans are a \"better environment\" for him than the Lakers.
