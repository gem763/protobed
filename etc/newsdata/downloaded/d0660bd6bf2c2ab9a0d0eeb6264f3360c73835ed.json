Before the rally, short sellers, who bet on a stock falling in price, were up more than $2 billion in mark-to-market profits.\n\nRead more: Don\u2019t Trust Tesla Stock\u2019s Big Move. Here\u2019s Why.\n\nTesla is the second-largest short in the U.S. equity market behind Apple (AAPL).\n\nShorts sellers have been trimming their Tesla positions since June, and many reduced their exposure ahead of earnings, hedging for a strong earnings report. About $8.3 billion worth of shorts held on to their positions, however, \u201cand took a major hit to their bottom line,\u201d S3 said.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting more short covering and the continuation of this long-term short squeeze as (Tesla\u2019s) stock price continues to show strength,\u201d S3 said in a report Thursday.\n\nRead more: Tesla Stock Is Soaring After Its Earnings Revealed a Surprise Profit\n\nThat has created two types of Tesla short sellers, those who have shorted the stock for a long time \u201cwith much more conviction and staying power,\u201d and the newer shorts, who are more momentum-based and more willing to exit a losing position.\n\n\u201cWhile the first group is relatively short-squeeze impervious, the second group is much more susceptible to stock price-based buying and selling,\u201d S3 said.\n\nTesla\u2019s short-seller interest hovers around $8.31 billion and about 32.62 million shares shorted, or 23% of Tesla\u2019s float. If the stock stays steady in the $300 range, the number of shares shorted are likely to fall below 30 million, S3 said.\n\nShort sellers bet on a stock falling in price. They then borrow the shares to sell them, hoping they can later pick them up at a lower price, return them to the original lender, and pocket the difference.\n\nTesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has criticized short sellers numerous times, and said earlier this year the shorts were \u201cfeeling the burn.\u201d\n\nTesla late Wednesday reported a hefty surprise third-quarter profit and sales that were slightly below Wall Street expectations.\n\nThe car maker also said key projects such as its China factory and next vehicle in its lineup, the Model Y, are \u201cahead of schedule.\u201d It kept its goal of delivering more than 360,000 vehicles this year and vowed to remain profitable with \u201cpossible temporary exceptions.\u201d\n\nTesla shares have lost 1.8% this year. That contrasts with gains of 21% and 16%, respectively, for the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nThis story was originally published on MarketWatch.\n\nRelated\n\nFacebook, Apple, and 3 Other Big Stocks That Could Drive the Market Next Week\n\nComments?
