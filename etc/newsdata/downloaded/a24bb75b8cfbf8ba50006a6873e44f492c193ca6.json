We are all captives of \u2018men\u2019s\u2019 notions and \u2018men\u2019s\u2019 sense of war. \u2018Men\u2019s\u2019 words. Women are silent.\u201d So writes the Nobel prize- winning journalist Svetlana Alexievich in the introduction to her celebrated book The Unwomanly Face of War.\n\nOriginally released in censored form in the Soviet Union in 1985, but first translated into English in a full, unexpurgated version only two years ago, it stitches together Alexievich\u2019s interviews with hundreds of Russian women involved in World War Two, from snipers to nurses, pilots to laundresses. And whether its subjects are offering up observations profound or particular, it is consistently, brilliantly, harrowingly illuminating. \u201cHow could I give birth in the midst of death?\u201d explains one woman, of her decision to have a makeshift abortion. \u201cFor me, the most terrible thing in war was \u2013 wearing men\u2019s underpants,\u201d recalls another.\n\nMore like this\n\nThree decades on, and female perspectives on war are still proving revelatory. One of this year\u2019s most universally acclaimed films, feature documentary For Sama, is the work of Waad Al-Kateab: a young Syrian woman who lived in Aleppo as it became a chief battleground in the Syrian civil war, with the forces of President Assad, backed by its ally, Russia, bombing the rebel-held city into submission.\n\nSpanning five years, from the first stirrings of anti-government dissent in Aleppo to the point at which she and many other citizens finally fled the city for good after the regime recaptured it, her raw, diary-esque footage allows viewers to experience the conflict through her eyes \u2013 as a nascent journalist, the wife of a doctor running a volunteer hospital and the mother of a young daughter.\n\nAll the people around me, all the time they were saying to me: why are you filming? Waad Al-Kateab\n\nBy means of a voiceover, Al-Kateab frames the film as an address to that child, Sama, who was born in 2015 and is an innocent counterpoint to the mayhem \u2013 right from the agonising opening sequence where we see her cherubic face in close up, just as an air strike begins. There follows an evacuation to the basement of the hospital, during which Al-Kateab hands Sama over to someone else to take downstairs.\n\nWhen a bomb hits right up close, on camera, Al-Kateab rushes to join them. There are some panicked, disorientating moments as she scours the blacked-out rooms for her daughter, as medics are doing their best to keep attending to patients. Eventually we see Sama, in her pink jacket, placidly feeding before throwing her milk bottle at the camera \u2013 her playful petulance putting in relief, with terrible irony, the adult aggression that has ruined the world into which she has been born.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps not surprising that, given the extreme situation in which she found herself, Waad never really saw herself as a \u201cfilmmaker\u201d, as she tells BBC Culture. Filmmaking was certainly not a vocation, but something she did out of a sense of urgent necessity. Some of For Sama\u2019s camerawork, notably the drone shots of Aleppo that punctuate the action, is remarkable for someone wholly self-taught.\n\nMemorialising the truth\n\nShe began making videos on her phone in 2011 and 2012, when she was part of the protests against Assad at Aleppo university, during which students were reportedly arrested and beaten by government forces; with the regime trying to deny anything was happening via official news channels, she says, her recording was a way of bearing witness to the truth.\n\nFrom there, she began to film her and her peers\u2019 day-to-day lives, including her burgeoning relationship with newly-qualified doctor and fellow activist Hamza, though others, including Hamza, couldn\u2019t understand why.\n\n\u201cAll the people around me, all the time they were saying to me: \u2018why are you filming?\u2019\u2026 like they would be going to play football and I\u2019d want to go with them ... and they\u2019d say \u2018why are you filming this shit?\u2019... they knew journalists were doing something important, but [what I was doing], for them, it didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nThe fact I knew I\u2019d be killed \u2013 that was in my mind all the time \u2013 Waad Al-Kateab\n\nThe turning point came in 2013, when her friend Gaith and Gaith\u2019s brother Mahmoud were killed in an air strike, she says. \u201cAfter this, [my friends would] never tell me to stop\u2026 [instead] they would see something and they were like \u2018Waad, come film\u2019, sometimes [even] when I was asleep or it was the middle of the night \u2013 and even when it was something that didn\u2019t seem very important in their mind like a pet shop or a flower seller.\u201d\n\nWhat Gaith\u2019s death brought home to everyone was the true value of Al-Kateab\u2019s footage \u2013 as a memorial for lives that could end at any point. And in enshrining their existence in film for posterity, she wanted to paint as complete and rounded a picture as possible. \u201cThe fact I knew I\u2019d be killed, that\u2019s so important and was in my mind all the time,\u201d Waad says. \u201cAnd so I needed [people] outside Aleppo to know exactly how our life was inside. For someone to take this footage so he can understand exactly why we did this and how we lived in that situation and how difficult \u2013 and how nice \u2013 it was sometimes.\u201d\n\nGradually, Al-Kateab began to collaborate with the media outside Syria; her videos appeared on the Orient TV and Al Arabiya networks before, in 2015, she began working with Channel 4 News. When she escaped Syria at the end of 2016, with various hard drives of footage in tow underneath her coat, she then discussed with Channel 4 the potential for something more substantial, and was paired up by them with the British documentary maker Edward Watts, to sift through what turned out to be over 500 hours of material she had managed to smuggle out.\n\nWatts, known for films such as 2015\u2019s Emmy-winning Escape from Isis, describes what she showed him as simply \u201cgobsmacking. I\u2019d always wanted to make a film about Syria\u2026 and one of the first things I felt was \u2018my God, this is the film I dreamt was out there that existed\u2019.\u201d As someone familiar with war-zones, he was struck, especially, by the emotional nuance that Al-Kateab had captured. \u201cIn those kind of environments, you see the best of people, as well as the worst. You see humour: people are always cracking jokes. And people actually show each other greater love and kindness and compassion than they would do in \u2018normal\u2019 [circumstances]. And that was what really hit me in her footage \u2013 here is this incredible baby, and this amazing love story, and the lighter side of human experience, which exists in conflict but we so rarely see.\u201d\n\nThe extraordinary circumstances often belie their very relatable emotions\n\nThe film\u2019s real power, indeed, is in its valorisation of the apparently incidental moments of war-torn existence. Centred around the hospital, it balances stomach-droppingly horrendous footage of death and suffering with that of Al-Kateab and Hamza\u2019s marriage, Sama\u2019s birth, and then, subsequently, muddling through life, along with their friends Salam and Afra. The portrait of the latter two is particularly joyous, from Salam gifting a persimmon fruit to a delighted Afra, or Afra joking about her daughter urinating on her out of fear during an air strike (\u201cwhat a poetic morning\u201d).\n\nTheir extraordinary circumstances often belie their very relatable emotions: when, over a scene of Al-Kateab and Hamza cuddling, her voiceover to Sama points out that this is the first time her and Sama\u2019s father have seen each other properly for four days, her having been filming, him having been in the emergency room, it\u2019s a measure of the high-stakes situation the couple are in \u2013 but, from another angle, reflects the frazzled routines of young working parents everywhere. Throughout, its slice-of-life observation proves the classic adage that the more specific art is, the more universal it becomes.\n\nA female gaze?\n\n\n\nBut to what extent should For Sama\u2019s take on war be understood specifically through the prism of gender? When thinking about the very notion of male or female perspectives on any subject, there is always the danger of essentialism and stereotyping. To think of great fictional war films directed by women, for example, Claire Denis\u2019 1999 classic Beau Travail, set among the ranks of the French Foreign Legion, has been seen by some as casting a sensual female gaze upon a military masculine sphere \u2013 though Denis herself has denied this reading. \u201cThe gaze is a decision. It\u2019s not a gender. It\u2019s a little disgusting to accept the female gaze,\u201d she said in one interview. And then what of Kathryn Bigelow, whose tough, tense Iraq war study The Hurt Locker was classified by some critics as an example of a woman making a straightforward \u2018man\u2019s film\u2019 \u2013 an explanation that was then cynically used to explain her success as the first female director to win an Oscar?\n\nBut while discussion of female and male points-of-view is necessarily crude and reductive, it is not invalid. In The Unwomanly Face of War, Alexievich is not shy of stating how she believes women fundamentally experience, and understand, war differently.\n\nThere are obvious ways in which her interviewees have had these differences forced upon them: despite the fact that almost one million women fought in the Red Army, the soldiers among them recount how they were patronised by their male comrades \u2013 and then shamed into covering up their involvement in \u2018unwomanly\u2019 business when they returned home. \u201cThere was no one that I could tell that I had been wounded, that I had a concussion,\u201d recalls one. \u201cTry telling it, and who will give you a job then, who will marry you? We were silent as fish.\u201d\n\nWar fascinates men as action and a conflict of ideas, of interests, whereas women are caught up with feelings \u2013 Svetlana Alexievich\n\nBut Alexievich also makes interesting observations about the manner in which her female subjects process war, even when their experiences are notionally similar to men \u2013 what they choose to focus on, or not. \u201cMen hide behind history, behind facts; war fascinates them as action and a conflict of ideas, of interests, whereas women are caught up with feelings,\u201d she writes and, to use her own distinction, it is apparent that her guiding mission is to provide a singularly \u2018unmanly\u2019 account of conflict \u2013 one that is interested in the micro rather than the macro view of events, and eschews any grand, overarching historical narrative in favour of intimate, un-footnoted individual testimonies, apparently strung together in a random order.\n\n\u201cSmall details are what is most important for me: the warmth and vividness of life\u201d she also declares at one point, and, as with For Sama, those are what sear themselves in the memory \u2013 whether that\u2019s one woman describing how she inexplicably tied a bouquet of violets to her bayonet, or another remembering hearing the wheat rustling amid the rat-a-tat-tat of German submachine guns.\n\nWhen it comes to For Sama, do Al-Kateab and Watts respectively see it as a specifically female vision of war? \u201cWaad and I have talked about this a lot. She\u2019s always the one that goes \u2018it's a human perspective,\u2019\u201d says Watts. \u201cBut I do think there is a point, which is, and I know this having been in conflict zones myself... the majority of men are often drawn towards the frontline and the fight and the explosion side of things. And I think what was so special about what Waad achieved was just the filming of the weevils in the rice or [Salam giving Afrab] a piece of fruit \u2013 and appreciating that was as much a part of the war, and the life [there], as the war itself.\u201d\n\nFor Al-Kateab, meanwhile, the fact that it is so deeply personal means it is self-evidently a gendered view of what was going on. \u201cI feel that it is my perspective as Waad, and I\u2019m a female so of course it is [female],\u201d as she puts it \u2013 which automatically marked what she was doing out because, she says, \u201cI knew that most of the war reports like news or documentaries, or whatever, even if [they were] from a female perspective, [they were] all limited by male power or rules.\u201d\n\nUniversal truths\n\nNot that, as a woman with a camera, she didn\u2019t have to contend with patriarchal assumptions while filming. Repeatedly, she says, she experienced condescension \u2013 on the one hand, people would laugh at her for wanting to film on the frontline and on the other, when she decided to concentrate on filming at the hospital, short-sighted male journalists would say she \u201cwas wasting her time\u2026 [she\u2019s just doing this] because she\u2019s female, and she can\u2019t be out.\u201d\n\nBut, most uniquely, For Sama offers a mother\u2019s perspective on war \u2013 a new mother, caught between standing up for her city, and country, and keeping safe the person most precious to her. At one point, we see her and Hamza making the agonising decision to return to an under-siege Aleppo with Sama after briefly getting out to visit Hamza\u2019s parents in Turkey; \u201cIn our hearts we felt we had to go back and bring you with us. We didn't know why. The truth is I can\u2019t believe we did even now\u201d her voiceover reflects. At another especially dark moment, she confesses to Sama, gut-wrenchingly \u201cI wish I\u2019d never given birth to you\u201d.\n\nMy experience of making films is they know what they want to be, but you as filmmakers are trying to hear that \u2013 Edward Watts\n\nTwice, at the hospital, we see mothers cradling dead children in their arms, the horror of which is countered elsewhere by the miracle of the chalk-white body of a seemingly-stillborn baby being resuscitated to life. These scenes resonate, as much as anything, as manifestations of Al-Kateab\u2019s most primal anxieties. She recalls how someone who saw the film asked her \u201c\u2018why are there so many children in the city? We\u2019ve never seen that in other reports\u2019\u2026 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know, I see them around me. When I saw a child, without any plan, I [just followed them] that way \u2013 or if I saw a mother, I [followed] her that way.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever an interesting point to note about For Sama\u2019s extraordinarily intimate vision \u2013 which perhaps muddies any assumption that it is also, by extension, a \u2018feminine\u2019 one \u2013 is that, when it came to selecting and editing the footage, Al-Kateab initially wanted to make a much less personal film. \u201cI just felt there were so many things to speak about more important than my personal life,\u201d she explains. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people who lived this story to say 'this is just Waad\u2019s story, this is not our story.\u2019\u201d\n\nWatts, with the benefit of distance, however, could see that Al-Kateab\u2019s individual story was the most emotionally resonant way to represent the collective experience of Aleppo\u2019s citizens to outsiders. \u201cAs we went through the process, I think more and more [Waad] came to understand this line which I learned from one of my old bosses that \u2018it\u2019s through the smallest window that you have the biggest view\u2019\u2026 the best thing that happened in the whole journey actually was when she took the final film to her friends in Turkey, and showed it to them. And at the end, they said, \u2018you know, this is your story, the story of you and Hamza and Sama, but it's all of our stories. The emotional essence of it is exactly what we all have been through.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs for the framing device of the voiceover addressed to Sama? That was also Watts\u2019 idea, on paper, though as he puts it, it was \u201cbasically both of us.\u201d \u201cThis may sound a little kooky but my experience of making films is they know what they want to be, but you as filmmakers are trying to hear that\u2026 The whole quality of Waad\u2019s filming and her story was infused with this sort of dialogue with Sama. It was almost unconscious... but so much of [her footage had this focus on] children and fighting for the future. It just felt like this is what the film\u2019s all about. It was just a matter of discovering it.\u201d\n\nIn the end, above and beyond gender, it\u2019s what Watts\u2019 calls the \u201cyin yang\u201d dynamic between Al-Kateab, as a female Syrian insider, and him, as a Western male outsider, that he thinks energised the edit. Certainly, what they have produced is a study of war with its own masterfully-judged balance: between light and shade, specificity and universality, visceral feeling and sharp-eyed structure.\n\nIn the film, Al-Kateab, who is now based in London with Hamza, Sama and her youngest daughter Taima, and working in the Channel 4 newsroom, expresses her frustration that \u201cmillions of people watch my reports but no one does anything to stop the regime.\u201d The hope of both directors is that, at a time when the civil war continues to rage in Idlib, the last remaining rebel-controlled city, For Sama\u2019s uniquely immersive quality may drive Western politicians to take action against the Assad regime.\n\nSince it first received a rapturous reception at the SXSW and Cannes Film Festivals earlier this year, it has secured US and UK theatrical releases, won numerous awards around the world, and has been screened at the UN, where it has also helped prompt an inquiry into the alleged systematic bombing of medical facilities by the Syrian regime and their Russian allies. The hope is that now it will be screened to the US congress and the UK\u2019s Houses of Parliament. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried our best to make these people think about this experience and go through one-and-a-half hours watching this in a way they can really understand,\u201d says Al-Kateab. \u201cAnd I still have hope that will really make a difference.\u201d\n\nFor Sama is released in UK cinemas on 13 September and will be screened on Frontline (PBS) in the US and on Channel 4 in the UK later in the year.\n\nLove film?
