This was driven by an Accord on Fire and Building Safety signed in the aftermath of the fire by international labour unions and major clothing brands, including local retailers such as Target and Myer.\n\nGranted, wages remain low to maintain their competitive advantage. Undoubtedly there are operations that don\u2019t follow the guidelines. But an overall sense of improvement is palpable.\n\nIt is unlikely that any change would have happened without a global outcry and the threat of consumer boycotts. In striving for a more ethical capitalism, one of the biggest challenges is merely identifying the various stakeholders in a dispersed, global economy.\n\nTake the frontline employees. While we watch the decline of local manufacturing, but the working classes have been reconstructed worldwide, be they garment workers in Bangladesh, car or smartphone assembly workers in China or Thailand, or foreign labourers on the construction sites of the Middle East.\n\nRegulation is easier when all the elements exists under a national banner, but changes in global industry make this difficult.\n\nIn the case of fast fashion, it took a monumental tragedy to even make us aware of the nature of the supply chain \u2013 an arms-length relationship between retailers and suppliers, a regulatory regime of voluntary ethical codes set by multinationals and a lack of protection for organised labour in low-income countries.\n\nWhile it is quite a burden for customers to research every aspect of the products and services they buy, firms are far more aware of the risks that disasters like Rana Plaza present to their brands.\n\nThe lesson of Rana plaza is that stakeholder and shareholder interests need not be zero sum. But it is not always clear that shareholders will be aware of all the stakeholders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was the legendary boss of General Electric, Jack Welch, who criticised the Milton Friedman idea that businesses should stick to shareholder returns alone: \u201cShareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world. Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy \u2026 your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products\".\n\nThere will need to be significant improvements in disclosure around the treatment of workers, community investment and environmental impact so that the market can reward leaders and penalise stragglers.\n\nThe overseas customer remains critical in driving this transparency, especially as both work and consumption in advanced economies are becoming more purpose-driven.\n\nJust as the system has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty across the developing world, the garment workers support their families or educate their children in the hope of something better. There is no question that these employees need capitalism to work.\n\nThe tide against shareholder primacy underlines a recognition that every link in the value chain that creates goods or services must be fairly treated for the global economic system to retain trust and sustainability. But there is still a knowledge gap in implementing this version of a truly inclusive capitalism.\n\nTanveer Ahmed is a practising psychiatrist.", "description": "Capitalism is lifting a new globalised working class out of poverty.
