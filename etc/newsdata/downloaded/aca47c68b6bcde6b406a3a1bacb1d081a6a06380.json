(Getty)\n\nApparently LeBron James isn\u2019t the only player with pull in the Los Angeles Lakers front office.\n\nAccording to Ramona Shelburne, newly acquired big man Anthony Davis is already making an impact on roster decisions.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nReport: Anthony Davis doesn\u2019t want to play center\n\nShelburne told her ESPN colleague Stephen A. Smith on his radio show Monday that Davis lobbied the front office to sign Dwight Howard in the aftermath of DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 ACL tear.\n\nIt seems he doesn\u2019t want to bang with centers like Nikola Jokic and Rudy Gobert.\n\n\u201cThe reason that Dwight is a Laker is because Anthony Davis doesn\u2019t want to play the five,\u201d Shelburne said, via Silver Screen and Roll. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to play against the big centers in the Western Conference. He needs a big dude next to him that can eat up some of those minutes and take some of that physical pounding from Nikola Jokic, (Jusuf) Nurkic or any of the centers you want to name out West.\u201d\n\nBeing a transcendent player has its benefits.\n\nLakers wise to listen to Davis\n\nIt makes sense that the Lakers would listen to Davis\u2019 concerns here, in that a happy, healthy Davis is best for all parties. Listed at 6-10 and 253 pounds, Davis is more than capable of playing center. An elite defender, he can guard the rim as well as anybody in the league not named Gobert.\n\nBut Davis\u2019 talents are many, and allowing him to stretch the floor as a power forward while protecting his body from the rigors of regular post play against the league\u2019s strongest bodies is a recipe for success and perhaps a longer career.\n\nHoward can provide value\n\nStory continues\n\nHoward, meanwhile, is well suited for the role. A strong, big-bodied center, Howard was one of the league\u2019s best defenders and rebounders in his prime. Despite the criticism he\u2019s endured as a late-career journeyman, he\u2019s remained effective on both fronts, averaging 12.5 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game in his most recent healthy season with the Charlotte Hornets in 2017-18.\n\nInjuries limited him to nine games last season with the Washington Wizards. But if he can remain healthy, he can play a valuable role in the Lakers rotation.\n\nA big part of that value will be limiting the physical toll of the game on his superstar teammate.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Anthony Davis would reportedly prefer Dwight Howard bear the brunt of banging with Western Conference centers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gjLmFsX7APRWZTMzD5AZgA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6gkdvclkO3x6TOFz0.Nesg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5db99ee0-ce8c-11e9-b9af-08633db82774"}
