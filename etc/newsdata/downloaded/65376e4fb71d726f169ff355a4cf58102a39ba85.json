The cryptocurrency may challenge 2019 high above $13,800 before the year\u2019s end.\n\nThe immediate outlook, however, is bearish and prices could drop to $8,800 in the next day or two, with the daily chart reporting buyer exhaustion. Further, China\u2019s state media has asked investors to avoid speculative behavior which could dampen trading.\n\nA pennant breakout on the hourly chart could yield a re-test of recent highs above $10,000, although that looks unlikely.\n\nA widely-tracked bitcoin (BTC) price indicator has turned bullish for the first time in over three months, hinting that a move to yearly highs lies ahead.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram \u2013 an indicator used to identify trend reversals and trend strength \u2013 has crossed above zero on the three-day chart, confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change. A positive reading was last observed in the first half of July.\n\nSeasoned traders may argue that the MACD\u2019s bullish turn cannot be trusted, as it is based on moving averages (MAs) which are lagging indicators.\n\nRelated: How Lebanon\u2019s Economic Crisis Highlights Bitcoin\u2019s Limitations\n\nWhile that sounds logical, the histogram has a strong track record of predicting trend changes and big moves, as seen in the chart below.\n\nThe MACD crossed above zero in late December 2018, confirming a bottom had been made near $3,100 and remained in the bullish territory throughout the first quarter, even though bitcoin\u2019s recovery rally remained capped above $4,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency broke into a bull market on April 2 with a convincing move above a bearish lower high of $4,236 created on Dec. 24.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin\u2019s Four-Month Bear Trend Intact Even After 16% Price Rise\n\nThe histogram fell below zero on Nov. 14 as prices breached the long-held support of $6,000. What followed was a sell-off to $3,100.\n\nGoing further back, the indicator\u2019s bullish turn in Oct. 2017 was followed by a meteoric rise from $7,000 to $20,000. Meanwhile, a drop below zero in early January 2018 fueled a deeper slide in bitcoin\u2019s price from $13,000 to $6,000.\n\nSo if history is a guide, the MACD\u2019s latest bullish turn could see bitcoin breaking out of a four-month falling channel and challenging yearly highs above $13,800 before the year\u2019s end.\n\nSupporting the bullish case is another piece of historical data that says BTC picks up a strong bid six months ahead of the mining reward halving due in May 2020.\n\nSo far, however, the MACD\u2019s move above zero has failed to be reflected in price gains. BTC is currently changing hands at $9,470 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.6 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, having faced rejection near the 100-day MA resistance at $9,625 during the Asian trading hours.\n\nNotably, bitcoin failed to close above the 100-day MA for the third straight day on Tuesday, having faced rejection above $10,000 over the weekend. as seen below.\n\nDaily chart and hourly charts\n\nThe repeated failure to hold onto gains above the 100-day MA indicates buyer exhaustion. A similar sentiment is echoed by Tuesday\u2019s red candle with a long upper shadow.\n\nAs a result, the odds of BTC diving out of the contracting triangle, or pennant pattern, on the hourly chart are high. At press time, the lower edge of the pennant is located at $9,260.\n\nA breakdown, if confirmed, could yield a sell-off to the former resistance-turned-support of $8,820 (formerly a bearish lower high).\n\nOn the other hand, a high-volume pennant breakout, if confirmed, would imply a resumption of the rally from Friday\u2019s low near $7,400 and will likely yield a quick break above $10,000.\n\nChina influence\n\nChina\u2019s state media has called investors to stay rational and avoid speculative behavior. The warning has come after Monday\u2019s sharp rise in blockchain-related stocks in China.\n\nInvestors poured money into bitcoin and blockchain-focused stocks after President Xi Jinping said last week that the world\u2019s second-largest economy should accelerate its adoption of the blockchain technology.\n\nThe comments by China\u2019s state media may force investors to scale back lofty expectations, leading to a price drop. A pennant breakdown, therefore, looks likely.\n\nThe overall outlook would turn bullish if and when the cryptocurrency invalidates the four-month bearish trend, as discussed on Monday.\n\nDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View\n\nRelated Stories", "description": "A widely-tracked bitcoin price indicator with a strong track record of predicting big moves has turned bullish for the first time in over three months.", "authors": ["Omkar Godbole"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BfZl19TX6TysfKKfb75KfQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/56787f44b952e92ef141d425d6b57ecd", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
