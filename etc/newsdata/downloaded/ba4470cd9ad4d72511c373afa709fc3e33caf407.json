Revenue growth was driven by an 8% increase due to volume, partially offset by a 4% decline due to lower realized prices, the company said in a statement. \"Increased U.S. volume for key growth products including Trulicity, Taltz, Emgality, Jardiance(R) , Verzenio(R) , and Basaglar(R) , was partially offset by decreased volume for Cialis(R) due to loss of patent exclusivity, as well as the impact from the product withdrawal of Lartruvo(R),\" the company said. The company is now expecting full-year EPS to range from $8.59 to $8.69 and adjusted EPS to range from $5.75 to $5.85. The FactSet consensus is for adjusted EPS of $5.72.
