Nine out of ten women in early stages of menopause were found to be keen to be given the option of a natural alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) which replaces the oestrogen that the body stops producing during menopause.\n\nMaryon Stewart, a women\u2019s health expert who conducted the poll, said the issue of menopausal women being inappropriately prescribed antidepressants was \u201cworrying on a number of levels\u201d and \u201cquite frankly insulting\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt is not a solution, it is not going to help their self-esteem or their relationships. In some cases, it can make them feel worse. We are constantly inundated with women who are suffering unbelievably who are not getting any effective help.\n\n\u201cThey are not mentally ill, antidepressants are not appropriate. Once they have the label, it doesn\u2019t help them. Some of the women tell me they feel worse on the antidepressants, some say they don\u2019t have much of an effect. Studies show that for menopause that antidepressants aren\u2019t that effective.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Women get to mid-life and feel like a shadow of their former selves and feel like their life is over. One woman who is currently suicidal has once again been prescribed antidepressants which are not doing anything. Doctors are not given enough help and advice themselves around the menopause. By their own admission, they are lacking education so therefore they can\u2019t help the women. The doctors are not educated enough to dig a bit.\u201d\n\nMs Stewart, who specialises in the menopause and hormonal health overall, said she had recently spoken to a GP who admitted to not \u201chaving a clue\u201d about how to help women going through the menopause.\n\nShe said she thought the current HRT shortage could potentially be compounding the problem of doctors dishing out antidepressants.\n\n\u201cIf doctors can\u2019t give HRT due to the shortage and it was previously in their tool bag for dealing with the menopause, they will be looking for other things to offer,\u201d Ms Stewart added.\n\nHRT medication has become increasingly difficult to get hold of since the end of last year, when supply issues that started in China forced some manufacturers to stop producing HRT patches. This led to increased demand for alternatives which subsequently then also became scarce.\n\nA survey of pharmacists recently discovered most are experiencing shortages of every major variety of medicine. It found 84 per cent were struggling to obtain HRT drugs.\n\nDr Louise Newson, a GP and menopause specialist, said: \u201cLow oestrogen and testosterone levels in our brains which occur during menopause often leads to symptoms such as low mood, reduced motivation, anxiety and poor sleep. Many women are misdiagnosed with depression. A study recently undertaken of nearly 3000 women by my non-profit Newson Health showed that 66 per cent of these had been inappropriately offered or given antidepressants for the low mood associated with their menopause.\n\n\u201cMenopause guidelines are very clear that antidepressants should not be given first line for low mood associated with the menopause because there is no evidence that they will help. Research has shown that if women are given HRT when they are perimenopausal then this can reduce the incidence of clinical depression developing. Many of the women who take HRT who have been incorrectly given antidepressants in the past find that their depressive symptoms improve to the extent that they can reduce and often stop taking their antidepressants.\u201d\n\nResearch from Nuffield Health has shown one in four women will experience debilitating symptoms that can last up to 15 years from menopause.", "description": "Women going through the menopause are being wrongly prescribed antidepressants which are making their symptoms worse and destroying their confidence, experts have warned.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/07/21/11/menopause.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
