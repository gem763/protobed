Then they took it away", "language": "en", "text": "On 10 March 2009, a case was filed in the US circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, where I grew up. Rothstein v American Airlines, Inc starred my father, Plaintiff Steven Rothstein, and the defendant, then the world\u2019s third-largest airline. With $23bn in annual revenue, American Airlines had nothing to lose. For my father, it was a last-ditch effort to save his life.\n\nHere\u2019s how it all took off. In the early 1980s, American rolled out AAirpass, a prepaid membership program that let very frequent flyers purchase discounted tickets by locking in a certain number of annual miles they presumed they might fly in advance. My 30-something-year-old father, having been a frequent flyer for his entire life, purchased one. Then, a few years later, American introduced something straight out of an avid traveler\u2019s fantasy: an unlimited ticket.\n\nIn 1987, amid a lucrative year as a Bear Stearns stockbroker, my father became one of only a few dozen people on earth to purchase an unlimited, lifetime AAirpass. A quarter of a million dollars gave him access to fly first class anywhere in the world on American for the rest of his life. He flew so much it paid for itself. Often he\u2019d leave in the morning for a business trip, fly back, and I hadn\u2019t even known he\u2019d left. Other times, I remember calling his office to find out what country he was in. He (and our whole family) was featured on NBC\u2019s Today Show in 2003, and then on MSNBC in 2006. For 20 years, he was one of American\u2019s top fliers, accumulating more than 30 million miles, which he acquired every time he flew, even with the AAirpass.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One of the many designs that American used for AAirpass. These cards were coveted more than gold. All photographs courtesy Caroline Rothstein\n\nThen, on 13 December 2008, American took the AAirpass away.\n\nFor several years, the revenues department at American had been monitoring my father and other AAirpass holders to see how much their golden tickets were costing the airline in lost revenue. After 20 years, it seems, they\u2019d decided the pass wasn\u2019t such a good idea. My father was one of several lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders American claimed had breached their contracts.\n\nA few months later, my father sued American for breaking their deal, and more importantly, taking away something integral to who he was. The legal fight went on for years without going to trial. The story became front-page news. The Los Angeles Times. The New York Post. Fox News. A slew of online outlets. It\u2019s even a perennially popular conversation topic on Reddit.\n\nThe obvious story is that my father was a decadent jet-setter who either screwed or got screwed by American; depends on your take. The coverage is always sensational. And I think \u2013 as does my whole family, including my dad \u2013 that at the very least, it doesn\u2019t quite land.\n\nLegend goes, upon bringing me to O\u2019Hare Airport as a baby, my father said, \u201cThis is daddy\u2019s playground.\u201d\n\nDad has loved to travel for his entire life. His father, Josh, was a navigator in the army air corps during the second world war and ran a company that manufactured paper and artificial flowers, traveling worldwide and telling stories about the places he went.\n\n\u201cWhen I was nine,\u201d Dad tells me, \u201cwe went to Denver. When he left in the morning to go on his business appointments, he said to me: stay at the pool, charge your lunch to the room, and I\u2019ll see you at dinnertime. Make sure you have your tie on.\u201d\n\nWhen he was 16, Dad\u2019s parents took him on a three-and-a-half-week trip: New York\u2013San Francisco\u2013Honolulu\u2013Kamuela\u2013Tokyo\u2013Nagoya\u2013Osaka\u2013Okinawa\u2013Taipei\u2013Hong Kong\u2013Calcutta\u2013Karachi\u2013Tehran\u2013Rome\u2013Florence\u2013Nice\u2013London\u2013New York.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Left: Dad with his mom in Hawaii on his first around-the-world trip. He was 16, circa 1967. Right: Dad, on the phone, and his colleague at the company\u2019s booth at a wallets and clothing trade show in Los Angeles, circa 1973.\n\n\u201cI began to taste, directly, the fervor of foreign travel,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI felt as at home in Copenhagen or Paris as I did in New York \u2026 I was a child of the world.\u201d\n\nHe wrote his college application on a typewriter at a hotel beach in Hawaii and mailed it from a post office in Osaka. In college he worked for a travel agency helping students book standby flights at low fares, which he utilized himself. \u201cI was on my own and could go anywhere at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d he reminisces. He flew to Europe several times a year and went to live there after graduating in 1972.\n\nThat December, he joined the wallet business \u2013 a company my grandfather had purchased \u2013 doing sales. He had an apartment in Manhattan on East 89th Street, but mostly, he was at the wallet factory in Oklahoma, or traveling, both for work and play. On the weekends, he\u2019d rush to Houston, Dallas, Wichita Falls, Mexico City or Acapulco, then back to work on Monday.\n\n\u201cSteven got on a plane like most people get on a bus,\u201d says my mom, Nancy Rothstein, who was married to my father for 36 years.\n\nTransitioning to finance, Dad moved to Chicago in 1976 for a stint at Smith Barney and, according to him, became the second-highest-grossing stockbroker at Bear Stearns in 1979, where he worked for a decade. Later, he focused on investment banking, and also became the largest shareholder of the financial corporation Olympic Cascade, the holding company of a brokerage firm, National Securities. Through it all, he continued flying. Everywhere. Airports and airplanes \u2013 they were who Dad was.\n\nWhen American started the AAdvantage program, Dad and Uncle Shelly (Mom\u2019s uncle and one of Dad\u2019s best friends and business associates) began flying even more than they already did. Then, after a good year at Bear, the investment in an unlimited pass made sense.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dad speaking at an event, organized by American Airlines\u2019 public relations team, where he was asked to donate miles for kids with cancer, circa 2000.\n\nIn September 1987, five months after my brother, Josh, was born, and three months after we moved from downtown Chicago into the north suburbs, Dad bought his unlimited lifetime AAirpass. The cost was $250,000, which the agreement stated was based on his age. My father was 37 years and four days old when he dated the check.\n\nTwo years later, which was one year before my younger sister, Natalie, was born, he added a companion feature to his AAirpass, allowing him to bring another person along on any flight. The cost was $150,000, based on his being 39 years old. This changed the game, not only for him, but our entire family.\n\nErnie Thurmond, a former American employee who handled Dad\u2019s AAirpass contracts, helped with adding some special stipulations. My parents decided early on to take separate planes so that in the unlikely event of a crash, at least one of them would be alive for their three children. So the agreement amendment stated: \u201cIf spouse is the companion, the spouse will be allowed to travel separately from Holder, provided that the spouse travels on the flight immediately prior to or just after the flight taken by Holder.\u201d My parents wouldn\u2019t fly on the same plane for at least a decade after that.\n\nMajor US and global hubs became Dad\u2019s office; American became his home. He knew every employee on his journey \u2013 from the curb, through security, to the gate, and on to the plane.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Dad found his go-to agent at the American Airlines Platinum desk: Lorraine Cross from Raleigh, North Carolina. None of us has ever met her in person. But Lorraine was family, her southern lilt a speakerphone staple at the dinner table. While my father befriended dozens and dozens of American employees throughout his tenure as one of their top fliers, no one played a role quite like Lorraine.\n\nLorraine and Dad became fast pals. Over the next decade-plus, he\u2019d send Lorraine \u2013 and others at Platinum \u2013 postcards from Maine when he took us to sleepaway camp, menus from restaurants around the world, and magazines from foreign airport lounges. Lorraine loved receiving these; she\u2019s even kept the postcards after all these years.\n\nShe says they shared inside jokes \u2014 a lot. \u201cEvery time I talked to your father, as we would close the conversation \u2013 I\u2019m southern \u2013 I would always say, \u2018Bye now.\u2019 \u2026 That was my closing. He would say, \u2018Pay later.\u2019 Caroline, we used to laugh all the time.\u201d\n\nLorraine and the other Platinum desk employees weren\u2019t his only pals. Recently, Dad described himself as being \u201clike an adopted child\u201d. American \u2013 and its employees \u2013 were his parents. He knew the skycaps at O\u2019Hare, LaGuardia, JFK, Heathrow, LAX; the people at the front desk at the Admirals Club pre-departure lounges; flight attendants on hauls he frequently flew; the gate attendants; and the folks who drove the carts from security to the gate, like Aamil.\n\nAamil \u2013 whose name I\u2019ve changed to respect his privacy \u2013 was a refugee who fled the Bosnian genocide with his family. Dad met Aamil when he was in high school, driving a cart at O\u2019Hare, and took him under his wing \u2013 errands and various paid-for-hire tasks. Ultimately, Aamil started coming over for dinner; picked us up at school; became Josh\u2019s \u201cbig brother\u201d ears for his dating rendezvous as he entered high school; and was both an employee and a dear, dear friend.\n\nDad \u201cwas gracious and kind in a way you don\u2019t see in a lot of people\u201d, Lorraine says, recollecting the time he helped fly some priests to Italy to see the Vatican, or when Mom called her from the local Gap to use miles to help a sales clerk visit her mother.\n\nDad gifted the miles and upgrades he accumulated throughout his life \u2013 both before and during his AAirpass tenure \u2013 to dozens and dozens of people. Once he upgraded my cantor and his wife to first class from Amsterdam. He regularly let relatives and people in crisis come along in his extra seat. There was the time he took my brother\u2019s best friend on his first airplane ever to see a football game; the American Airlines employee he saw in India, crying because she might lose her job if she didn\u2019t make it to Toronto; his brother and sister-in-law for their honeymoon; a guy from college and his wife who really wanted to go to Australia; a man in the back office at National Securities, who wanted to visit his dying father (he got there just in time).\n\n\u201cYour family\u2019s heart is as big as the state of Texas,\u201d Lorraine says. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible how many lives they touched and how many lives touched them because they\u2019re very sensitive and attuned to what goes on in the world.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not saying Dad was a saint. Just that his AAirpass was about more than solipsistic travel. It allowed him to build relationships. And it allowed other people to access the world like he did. That\u2019s what Dad\u2019s AAirpass and ultra-elite flying status yielded for him: lifelong bonds.\n\nOn 13 January 1998, the American Airlines CEO, Robert Crandall, wrote my father a letter after they\u2019d seen each other on the Concorde (a transatlantic supersonic aircraft).\n\nAt the end, Crandall wrote: I am delighted that you\u2019ve enjoyed your AAirpass investment \u2013 you can count on us to keep the Company solid, and to honor the deal, far into the future.\n\nMy friend Phil likes to say my father ran his life like a corporation and raised me in it. His underwear was pressed. UPS and FedEx came nightly to our driveway to drop things off, pick things up. He had packing down to a science \u2013 sets of clothes folded and fitted into plastic cases, cosmetics ready to go. We had a whole suitcase closet in the basement, and at some point, he turned the downstairs guest room into a staging area for packing.\n\n\u201cThey sort of broke the mold when they made him,\u201d says Mom, who is a sleep consultant.\n\nHe stored everything he collected while traveling in the basement \u2013 hotel soaps, shampoos, conditioners; his thickened old passports; towels; shirts; hairdryers and combs from around the world \u2013 in what we called his \u201cSecret Room\u201d, the key hidden in his office desk. A fun party trick was bringing people inside \u2013 his business associates, my siblings and my friends. Sometimes we used the items ourselves. Often, we gave things away. After Hurricane Katrina, Dad and I flew down to New Orleans with boxes of clothes and toiletries. When he went to India, he brought things along. Like travel, for Dad, the Secret Room was an extension of souvenir collecting as a kid.\n\nDad eating on an international flight, circa 1996.\n\nAs a kid myself, I often complained about Dad\u2019s excessive traveling. I used words like \u201cabandonment\u201d and \u201cneglect\u201d. In retrospect, that was wildly dramatic. But it\u2019s how I felt.\n\n\u201cNo matter where Steven went, there wasn\u2019t a day we didn\u2019t talk,\u201d Mom says. \u201cSome men are home every night at 5.30 from the office, but they\u2019re not really there. Steven Rothstein was there.\u201d She emphasizes there with a deep, grinding grunt. \u201cWhether he was in the house or out of the house, he was very involved. He was very much there. And always in touch. I mean, he used a phone \u2026 he was one of the first people with a cellphone.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right. Most of my life, I focused on how Dad was always on a plane. When I think about it now, when he was home, he was there: sitting with me on my bedroom floor, or at the dinner table, or coming in to kiss me goodnight. He has a presence. Not only a loud voice, but also a boom of self. He arrives. He is both taking off and landing at once.\n\n\u201cHe never missed an opportunity to come home to the family,\u201d Lorraine says. \u201cI don\u2019t care where he was going. I don\u2019t care what he was doing. If there was a chance he could come home and stay with his family overnight, he preferred that to any hotel in the world.\n\n\u201cI really valued and appreciated that from him,\u201d she says. \u201cHis family meant the most. I would say, \u2018That\u2019s a long way to go, are you gonna overnight and come back the next day?\u2019 He\u2019d go, \u2018No, I wanna sleep in my own bed. I wanna go home. I wanna be with my family.\u2019\u201d\n\nI laugh, tears in my eyes. I didn\u2019t know this.\n\n\u201cThat was crucial to him, to be with his family,\u201d Lorraine says. \u201cHe did some crazy stuff to make that happen over the years.\u201d\n\nDad was an airport celebrity, and when we traveled together, it embarrassed the shit out of me. Like riding a cart from security to the gate (because as a family, we ran late \u2013 Dad has a knack for rushed arrivals). I would bow my head so I couldn\u2019t make eye contact with anyone we passed. Or walking into the Admirals Club locations and having the folks at the front desk know us by name.\n\nOr when, in second grade, he took me to Japan for the weekend because he wanted me to experience an inaugural flight (San Jose to Tokyo). We were in the bulkhead, the first row of any flight cabin. As we landed, there were reporters flooding the jet bridge to photograph the first person off the flight. Technically, based on his seat, that was Dad. But as he figured out what was happening, he insisted I go first so I could be the star. I stood there with my seven-year-old smile, bright-colored headband, and long V-neck Limited Too sweater hanging down to my thighs.\n\nI was mortified. But Dad wanted us to experience absolutely everything there was in life.\n\nHe wanted to take me to all 50 states by the time I was 11. We put a big US map on the wall behind his home office desk. After each trip, I\u2019d add a pin to the visited state; another for the places I wanted to go. When we\u2019d gone to 30-something states, I asked to stop; I wanted to be able to have new adventures as an adult.\n\n\u201cYou grew up with a different lens than most people you knew,\u201d Mom says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying \u2026 that other people didn\u2019t travel all over the world. But I sort of doubt, for the most part, they had the kind of wanderlust and open-mindedness and fascination that your father had with the world, and still does, for that matter.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember saying, at some times \u2026 to Steven \u2026 are we taking away [their] future experiences by showing you so much so young? But looking back, if it were [me], I\u2019d much rather have had this global exposure as a child than waiting until I was an adult. Wouldn\u2019t you say it framed you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answer.\n\n\u201cNot only framed you,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut it helped with your, your tapestry. It was woven into your tapestry. Into the fabric of who you are, and how you look at other people and the world.\u201d\n\nI understood the weight and privilege as a kid. I understood \u2013 we all did \u2013 that the AAirpass meant my father could travel and do business in unprecedented ways, and it allowed our entire family to travel in ways few people on earth could. We got the privileges, all of them, all of us.\n\nI ask my sister, Natalie, a psychotherapist living in Chicago, her earliest memories of traveling on an airplane: landing in Australia at age three, walking down the aisle as the plane was still moving, and someone grabbing her to keep her safe. \u201cI think I remember that because it was really dramatic,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a lot of vivid memories from that trip, actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you aware that we were in first class?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sit out of first class until I was 12 years old,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I was aware when I was three years old. But I was aware very early.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Left: Me, Natalie, and Josh with Misty, a teacher from our elementary school, who came with us on the family trip to Australia over winter break, December 1993. Right: Part of a collage made by Mom with a photo of the five of us: Mom, Dad, Josh, Natalie and me in Sydney, Australia, December 1993.\n\nWont to interrogate privilege \u2013 race, class and otherwise \u2013 I pry. Did she really get that first class was different than the rest of the plane?\n\n\u201cFor a long time, I really wanted to sit in coach,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I felt uncomfortable being a kid in first class when it was clearly where all fancy adults were sitting. It was clear I was surrounded by mostly people who had a lot of money, and I was always one of the only kids in first class, and that felt weird and I always wanted to be with other kids in coach.\u201d\n\nThat trip to Australia (I was in fifth grade) was our first big international family vacation. The following year, Dad, on a whim, said to Mom: let\u2019s go to Tokyo.\n\n\u201cJapan!\u201d she said. \u201cOver Christmas? Are you kidding?\u201d\n\nBut we went.\n\nMom can still perfectly picture us all at dusk in Tokyo: \u201cDad has on his camel coat. You and Josh are in all the black-and-white-check stuff. We\u2019re walking through an aisle of stalls \u2026 going to yet another monastery or shrine and the flavors that we felt and saw and tasted \u2026 it was probably one of the best Christmas vacations we\u2019d ever had because we were the only people in the hotel.\u201d She starts chuckling. \u201cAnd it was so much fun. It was so unusual to be Americans at Christmas in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cIt was about seeing the world \u2026 We wanted to connect to the people,\u201d she says. As she recounts these stories, her tone is somewhere between euphoric and frenzied. She punctuates each story with an \u201coh my God\u201d and transitions immediately into the next.\n\n\u201cWhen we were in India \u2026 we got so friendly with our cab driver that we brought him for dinner to the hotel \u2026 For a while we were in touch \u2026 We would send him pictures and things. That was the kind of richness that this AAirpass, this sense of a family traveling anywhere we wanted to go in the world that American could take us \u2013 that\u2019s what we did. People enriched us. Hopefully we enriched others.\u201d\n\nShe starts laughing as she recalls a time we visited the Holy Sepulchre in Israel and Dad got in trouble for lying down with his yoga strap, trying to stretch his back in front of the church. \u201cI mean, there was so much color in what we did and where we went and how we did it. The travel was first class, the hotels were first class, but the experiences were very real and authentic.\u201d And then without skipping a beat, she goes up an octave with: \u201cOh my God \u2026 so Josh was dead when we first went to India, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cJosh was dead both times we went to India,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he was very much with us, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\nOn 6 October 2002, Josh \u2013 15 and a half \u2013 was hit by a car while walking down the sidewalk. The car had pulled an illegal U-turn. To avoid a collision, another driver accidentally accelerated, swerved up on to the sidewalk and flung Josh into the side of a building. His head hit the building. He was knocked unconscious. My uncle Jeffrey called me from Scarsdale and told me to get on a plane. It was my first month of college; I rushed to the Philadelphia airport and bought a ticket home. I landed at O\u2019Hare, descended to baggage claim, into more uncles\u2019 arms. Their faces distraught: It doesn\u2019t look good. It would be at least another 15 years before I could descend the American Airlines baggage claim escalator without going into a trauma shock.\n\nJosh died the next morning \u2013 our rabbi and the hospital chaplain reciting the end of life Hebrew blessings and prayers; Dad, Natalie, our maternal grandmother, and me standing around the bed; Mom\u2019s own body draped alongside her dying son; Natalie\u2019s hand on his heart for his last beat.\n\nJosh on Dad\u2019s shoulders in Ogunquit, Maine, early 1990s.\n\nOver a thousand people attended his funeral. Lorraine helped get people on flights. I remember a family friend walking through the front door of our home after a flight from Australia, as if she\u2019d taken a bus.\n\nTo say Josh\u2019s death broke Dad would be an understatement. Ernie from American says it was sad to watch Dad when they occasionally saw each other over the years. \u201cHe\u2019s not the same person any more,\u201d Ernie says.\n\nJosh was Dad\u2019s little buddy. His only son. He\u2019d already lost his father in 1989, and he would soon lose the companionship of Uncle Shelly, when Shelly had a stroke.\n\n\u201cPeople react to tragedy in different ways,\u201d Lorraine says. \u201cHe let Josh\u2019s death take the best of him away \u2026 Outwardly, his strength was renowned. But I knew how much it impacted him \u2026 I know his children meant more to him than any business deal, than any situation in life that could come up.\u201d\n\nRight after Josh died, Dad leaned on people like Lorraine, and other agents and employees, which I hadn\u2019t known until writing this piece. I had asked Dad what the media tends to overlook when they cover this story.\n\n\u201cWhen everyone was asleep in the house,\u201d he tells me, \u201cand I had nobody to talk to, and I was lonely about Josh\u2019s death, I would telephone American Airlines reservations and speak to the agents about who knows what for an hour and then at the end, they\u2019d ask me, oh, what reservation was I calling about to make, and I would say, \u2018Oh yeah, I need to go to San Francisco next week.\u2019 I really didn\u2019t need to go to San Francisco. I was just very confused and very lonely and I was calling American Airlines because they were logical people for me to speak to. They knew me. I knew them. I knew their names. I knew their lives.\u201d\n\nI tell Dad this makes sense, to lean on the community you know in a time of need.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mom, Dad, Natalie and me after Josh\u2019s death, at the Taj Mahal, Agra, India, 2005.\n\n\u201cI traveled all over the world,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing from the front of American Airlines to the gate, I might see a dozen people, each of whom would say hello to me, and I would say hello to all of them.\u201d Dad says that about 10 American Airlines employees came to Josh\u2019s funeral. \u201cThat\u2019s an extremely unusual relationship for a passenger to have with the airlines.\u201d\n\nI talk to Natalie, who was still at home with a front row seat to his grief while I was away at college. She tells me about the shame Dad felt when people in our community often pitied him after Josh died \u2013 and still do \u2013 as if he were a broken man. But the airport and American were where he was still treated like a full, whole man.\n\n\u201cHis community at American treated him like a normal human, and walking through the airport, they didn\u2019t treat him like he was broken, the way a lot of his other worlds did,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the only sense of normalcy that he still had.\u201d\n\nSix years and two months later, Dad arrived at O\u2019Hare with Aamil, who needed to go to Sarajevo but didn\u2019t have the cash, so Dad offered to fly him to London on his AAirpass and then pay for his London hotel and airfare from there to Sarajevo.\n\n\u201c I went into the ticket counter. I checked in my luggage for London. I walked to the gate \u2026 and just as I was walking on the plane, they handed me a letter terminating the AAirpass,\u201d Dad recounts. \u201cWhy did they let me go to the gate? Why didn\u2019t they tell me up front, which would have been the nice thing to do?\u201d\n\nTurns out a letter had been drafted to notify Dad that they were concerned with his behavior and use of the pass. But they decided not to send it. They didn\u2019t want the bad press \u2013 what it might mean to terminate a lifetime AAirpass from a frequent flyer. So they terminated it without warning, at the airport \u2013 a punch right into Dad\u2019s proverbial heart.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dad opening his tote bag next to a London taxi, late 1990s.\n\nEven Lorraine hadn\u2019t been notified. \u201cI walked in one day from work,\u201d she said in a deposition, \u201cand received notification that the AAirpass had been terminated. I was probably more shocked than anyone else.\u201d No warning. No input sought, even though she had been regularly managing his and other top fliers\u2019 bookings.\n\nDad\u2019s luggage went to London. They wouldn\u2019t help him get it back. Aamil never made it to Sarajevo. In fact, that was one of the last times they ever spoke. Ultimately, Aamil disappeared from our lives.\n\nDad doesn\u2019t think Aamil understood the \u201cshock and horror\u201d of what had happened. Dad went home. Told Mom. Got in bed. And slept for the rest of the weekend, and arguably \u2013 at least figuratively \u2013 for a really long time after that. \u201cI was in disbelief,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was in shock. And I had no idea how I was going to live my life the way I lived it.\u201d\n\nThe AAirpass was Dad\u2019s lifeline. His blood. Mom described his relationship with it as \u201csacrosanct\u201d. There was a contract. Rules. It was his superpower. He didn\u2019t ever want to do anything wrong.\n\nBut American claimed he did.\n\nDad was one of a few lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders that American had been monitoring and claimed had breached their contracts. They claimed Dad made \u201cspeculative bookings\u201d and a host of other things that they interpreted as objectionable based on a clause in the contract about \u201cfraudulent usage\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen I bought the AAirpass, in no uncertain terms, they told me that there was only one rule: I couldn\u2019t give anybody the AAirpass,\u201d Dad says. \u201cAnd those were the days before they took identification from passengers.\u201d A former colleague had once offered him five grand a week to use the AAirpass. Dad told the guy he was \u201ccrazy\u201d.\n\nBut now, after years of secret investigation, apparently Dad and others were costing American too much money. Though Dad had dealt with the reservations agents on an almost daily basis, it was the revenues department that got involved, interjected, and launched an investigation that brought the whole house down.\n\nOn 10 March 2009, Dad sued American for breaking their deal, claiming $7m in damages. The dollar amount was based on the value of the lifetime unlimited AAirpass the last time it was sold for public consumption \u2013 though American had stopped selling them in 1994, a 2004 Neiman Marcus catalogue offered them for 3 million bucks. So it was the Neiman\u2019s figure plus estimated costs for first-class travel for the rest of his life.\n\nA primary issue in the case was whether American properly terminated his AAirpass Agreement based on Section 12, which read:\n\n12. FRAUDULENT USAGE. If American determines that an AAirpass has been fraudulently used, American reserves the right to revoke the AAirpass and all privileges associated with it. Holder will thereupon forfeit all rights to the AAirpass, without refund, and will return the AAirpass card and this Agreement shall terminate.\n\nThey claimed that his \u201cfraudulent usage\u201d included booking empty seats for his companion feature under \u201cBag Rothstein\u201d or \u201cSteven Rothstein Jr\u201d (which they had for years condoned, and Mom says was not Dad\u2019s idea), as well as \u201cbooking speculative reservations\u201d \u2013 ie, flight reservations he was allegedly never planning to actually take.\n\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t think he materially violated any of the use of the AAirpass as it [was written],\u201d says Ernie. \u201cBut he used it a lot of times not as they intended for it to work. I think that\u2019s where they got pissed off, not to mention the fact that they had this liability sitting out on the books with all of these unlimited lifetime cardholders. \u2026 My guess, and I have no idea whatsoever about this [is] that they just wanted to get rid of it \u2026 even if they had to be mean.\u201d\n\nDad believes there was someone at American who decided, \u201cOh, if these guys didn\u2019t have these goddamn AAirpasses, it would be great.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lorraine and the legal documents, a longtime American employee launched the investigation, looking into several other AAirpass holders, including Dad and Jacques Vroom, another lifetime unlimited customer, whose AAirpass termination also resulted in a lawsuit.\n\n(I reached out to American Airlines for comment on this article. Their media relations representative said: \u201cWe are pleased to continue to provide AirPass benefits to eligible cardholders when enjoyed in conjunction with the appropriate program conditions.\u201d They said they did not have anything to add beyond what\u2019s already in the court documents.)\n\nTruth is, AAirpass was \u2013 even in its earliest, earliest days \u2013 a failed program. It didn\u2019t yield the revenue they\u2019d hoped. In 2017, one writer listed the lifetime unlimited AAirpass as number one on the \u201c7 Worst Marketing Disasters in human history\u201d. In fact, when AAirpass started, according to Ernie, American thought they\u2019d make \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d selling them, but they did not. \u201cIt became painful,\u201d Ernie says. He says he tried several times to get them to shut it down; they didn\u2019t want to admit defeat.\n\nAs for the case, American anticipated a resolution without a trial; Dad anticipated a trial by jury. Instead, everything happened in legal offices, calls, motions and documents, judges\u2019 chambers and depositions. They spent the summer of 2009 debating \u2013 back and forth \u2013 over the fraud clause, and whether it was ambiguous or clear.\n\nThen, American counterclaimed, saying Dad broke the contract by improperly using the companion feature. In early 2010, they claimed, \u201cRothstein had a history of making speculative, fictitious, impossible and/or illogical reservations on behalf of companions.\u201d They claimed these \u201ccompanions\u201d were people with whom he \u201chad no intention of traveling\u201d.\n\nThe senior analyst who launched the investigation reviewed and analyzed Dad\u2019s flight records, and claimed \u201cthat between December 2003 and April 2004, Steven Rothstein made companion reservations using \u2018Steven Rothstein, Jr.\u2019 using for his AAirpass companion feature for at least 41 flight segments\u201d. But again, they had condoned his booking companion seats under fictitious names for years. In April 2004, an American employee had approached Dad and asked him to stop, as security measures around flying had clearly started to shift after September 11. So he stopped.\n\nBut they continued investigating him, looking for a way to push him out.\n\nAnother document shows that American contends that 14 incidents from August 2006 to November 2008 were considered \u201cfraudulent\u201d under their alleged terms \u2013 but Dad was never notified that they were considered fraudulent at the time they were made.\n\nIn her deposition, Lorraine said she hadn\u2019t received any written directions from American Airlines regarding what was and was not \u201cacceptable practice for making reservations for the Executive Platinum customers\u201d.\n\nLorraine said, both in her deposition and our interview, that she didn\u2019t suspect misuse of his AAirpass; they were the ones handling all of his bookings. Yet, they \u2013 Lorraine, and anyone else in reservations \u2013 weren\u2019t contacted at all once revenues began the investigations.\n\nMom chuckles when she recalls sitting in the federal judge\u2019s chambers with the attorneys in 2010 as American noted his making \u201cfraudulent reservations\u201d.\n\n\u201cSteven never made a single reservation on his own on a computer,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery single reservation he ever made was made with an American Airlines paid employee.\u201d Dad didn\u2019t use a computer. He was the first person I knew to have a cellphone, and then the first person I knew to get a BlackBerry (and remains one of the last to have one). To write letters, he\u2019d use an electric typewriter or audio-record memos on his Dictaphone and mail mini cassette tapes to his secretary to type and then fax or mail accordingly. But a computer \u2013 never. Still doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cAs anybody can see in the documentation \u2013 with the letter from [American Airlines CEO] Crandell, or anything else \u2013 he didn\u2019t do anything alone,\u201d Mom says. \u201cThey all condoned it.\u201d\n\nErnie says Dad found creative ways to use his AAirpass, even though Ernie knows of other cardholders who absolutely violated the terms of use \u2013 letting others use it, getting paid. \u201cHe would be at the airport waiting to board an airplane by himself,\u201d Ernie says, \u201cand he would meet somebody at, like, the Admirals Club and get into a conversation with them and they\u2019re on the same flight he is and he said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t we continue this conversation on the airplane? Let me go check and see if they\u2019ve got any open seats in first class,\u2019 and he would invite that person to join him.\n\n\u201cIt was not prohibited by the language of the contract,\u201d Ernie says. \u201cBut it was not intended to be used like that \u2026 I don\u2019t think Steve did anything that was directly or intentionally trying to do something that was \u2026 against the rules. Certainly it took some interpretation on American\u2019s part to go after him.\u201d\n\nSeven third-party witnesses connected to Dad \u2013 family members, friends and business associates \u2013 were interviewed during discovery. They were questioned by American around the \u201cspeculative bookings\u201d that were deemed retroactively fraudulent.\n\nSometimes Dad would spontaneously book a flight for him and a companion \u2013 say, taking my aunt to visit my cousin in Denver \u2013 planning to twist his loved one\u2019s arm to travel at the drop of a hat. But that\u2019s the challenge. Rarely could anyone else do that, even if they gave their word. Only Dad knew how to drop everything and fly. That was his superpower. He had wings. The family member, or colleague, or friend he hoped to take along couldn\u2019t always go.\n\nDad\u2019s lawyer asked one of my uncles: \u201cDo you have any reason to believe that Steven Rothstein made reservations in your name without actually intending to bring you along as his companion?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d he said.\n\nMaybe it seems normal to me because that\u2019s how I was socialized, in the vortex realm of a father who treated an airplane like a bus. As a journalist, now, I can read the court documents and understand where \u2013 from American\u2019s standpoint \u2013 this behavior was kind of absurd. Yet American Airlines agents condoned it for decades. And understanding that the legal terms of the contract and agreement stipulated that fraud meant giving someone else your pass to use, Dad\u2019s quirky and hectic and allegedly \u201cspeculative\u201d behavior seems reasonable within how he worked.\n\nThere was discovery and depositions throughout 2010; there were seemingly endless motions and American kept extending discovery; then a summary judgment in American\u2019s favor on 30 June 2011. They had won.\n\nAmerican dismissed \u201cwith prejudice\u201d their remaining counterclaims; then the case went into a holding pattern after American\u2019s parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy that fall; a joint stipulation of dismissal was filed on 21 September 2012, the day before Dad turned 62.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the end end. As mentioned, the judge issued a summary judgment. Then, the court of appeals affirmed. Dad had lost. The appeal stayed until American exited bankruptcy in December 2013. And the final chunks of paperwork were filed in 2014. But it never really quieted.\n\nI didn\u2019t know the full details of the trial until I wrote this piece. That my mother, two uncles and an aunt all went in for depositions, or that hundreds of legal hours and thousands of dollars and documents unfolded. I didn\u2019t quite get the magnitude until taking off my daughter hat and trading it in for my journalistic reporter lens.\n\nThis spring, after gaining access to the court documents, and reading over 80 documents in full, I call Dad as I leave my writing space at 11.30pm and walk to the subway station at Union Square in Manhattan. I say this is clear: what American did to interpret fraud was out of line. But I say: \u201cDad, some of the bookings they cited for what they called speculative as evidence in the case were \u2026 well \u2026 shady.\u201d\n\nI had read in the court documents that, according to the senior analyst at American Airlines who investigated Dad and other AAirpass holders, of the 3,009 flight segments Dad booked for himself from May 2005 to December 2008, he either canceled or was considered a \u201cno-show\u201d for 84% of those reservations. During the same time period, he booked 2,648 flight segments for travel companions, and 2,269 were either canceled or a no-show.\n\nI tell him I need to maintain my journalistic balance and integrity. I ask him point blank: \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal?\u201d\n\nAs I get on the subway, he writes me an email detailing how when he purchased the companion feature \u201cit was 100% contemplated that [he] would buy a seat for nobody to keep it empty\u201d. They gave him examples of empty seats for legal documents, an extra carry-on, or even musical instruments.\n\n\u201cThe example given to me was that Yo-Yo Ma, with whom I flew more than twice and whom I met in several hotel lobbies, flew with his [cello] in the next seat. Under those terms I bought the extra seat.\u201d He thought it would be Mom, my siblings, me, Uncle Shelly, a business associate, or someone he \u201cmet at the airport. Anyone I wanted. Anyone. Documents.\u201d\n\nMy Airbnb habit left me sleeping under my desk \u2013 but it saved my career Read more\n\nHe goes on: \u201cAfter they told me not to buy an empty seat they knew that I was in a huge depression in the actual MEDICAL SENSE. IT WAS A SERIOUS DEPRESSION. I was incoherent, crying several times daily, drinking liquor which I never did before and if I got in a seat I didn\u2019t want to explain why I was crying to anyone.\u201d So he wanted it empty. He wanted to be alone, just as had always been his booking practice on many airlines, even well before the AAirpass days. He liked his space. He liked access to bringing extra carry-on bags. He liked some privacy. The airplane was his home. It\u2019s where he lived. It\u2019s where he got to do work, or catch up on sleep, or regenerate. Then, once Josh died, it\u2019s where he grieved. He was at home.\n\nPeople buy extra and empty seats all the time. Technically, that\u2019s what he\u2019d done with the companion feature. A permanent extra seat for life \u2013 whether another human was in it or not.\n\n\u201cSo in my incoherent state,\u201d he writes, \u201cI would book a seat for Dan or Laurie just imagining that they might come. I was making reservations and didn\u2019t know whether I was even going. Here is why. I was up and [alone] in my home office and bored. So I would call the 800 number for the AAirpass desk and talk to the agent about the news or the weather or about Paris or little London. Then, after an hour of nothing they had to hang up. So I would make a reservation and ask them to fax it to me. Then the next day I would take the fax and cancel the reservation. I needed someone to talk to at midnight. The 800 number was open.\u201d\n\nIn one sense, I understand how these could be interpreted as \u201cspeculative bookings\u201d. Dad does admit he booked seats he wasn\u2019t sure that he, or his companions, would ultimately use. But that\u2019s not an uncommon practice, and he never understood it to be against the rules. His understanding was that fraudulent behavior was limited to giving the AAirpass to someone else \u2013 which he never did.\n\n\u201cI never booked my own reservation on a computer,\u201d he reminds me. \u201cI never knew how to do this. So every single one of the reservations they didn\u2019t like was booked and/or changed by an American employee. Again. I didn\u2019t know how to use a computer. I still have never ever ever booked any reservation online. I always use the phone. So their own agents never stopped me from anything. And I didn\u2019t understand what American was asking me to do or not to do because my mind was torn apart from depression. Real depression.\u201d\n\nThe 7 April 2018, article in the Hustle by Zachary Crockett quoted my father saying: \u201cI wish I\u2019d never bought the thing.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, I speak to Dad, in India, where he\u2019s traveling for work. He FaceTimes me from his hotel room (from an iPad, still no computer). He sits on a couch, a desk and bright lights trailing in the background.\n\nI ask if he\u2019s accepted the loss \u2013 the AAirpass.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dad asleep in seat 1A, the left-hand front seat, early 2000s.\n\n\u201cProbably, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cEnough\u2019s enough. I can\u2019t worry about it all day long.\u201d\n\nTwenty-six minutes and thirty seconds later, after he\u2019s relived 13 December 2008, so I could recount it above, something shifts.\n\n\u201cWhy did they have to be mean?\u201d he says. And later, he interrupts himself mid-story: \u201cWhat American did was nasty.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like there isn\u2019t space for anything else in his mouth or head.\n\n\u201cIt took away my mobility. It took away my hobby. I thought that I could go to Sweden for the weekend in July and pick up flowers when I was 70.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that, can I?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how do you feel about it all now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m angry,\u201d he says. \u201cStill. I\u2019m less angry. But I\u2019m still angry.\n\n\u201cThey stole my personality,\u201d he continues. \u201cThey stole my love. They stole the very thing that caused me to give them a half a million dollars in the first place. And a half a million dollars is probably like 5 million dollars today. And they did it maliciously. If there had been a problem, the proper thing to do would have been to telephone me and tell me they\u2019d like me to change the way I used the AAirpass.\u201d\n\nI remind him that when we started talking, now 59 minutes ago, he said he had accepted it all.\n\n\u201cI guess as I think about,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m angry. So maybe someplace in between. Or maybe my mind goes back and forth.\u201d\n\nGrief and death don\u2019t discriminate. Loss \u2013 human life, financial wealth, material goods \u2013 doesn\u2019t discriminate either. It\u2019s gut-wrenching no matter what. Of course, racial and class privilege, body ability, access to healthcare and support, and other privileges obviously play a massive role. But the inside spectacle of pain is traumatic across the board.\n\n\u201cYour dad was so depressed as it was,\u201d Mom says. \u201cHe was totally unglued after Josh died, and then he loses the one thing that gives him some freedom to run away from his grief.\u201d\n\nThe AAirpass \u201calso wasn\u2019t just a loss for him\u201d, I say to Mom. \u201cIt was a loss for our family because it gave us access to experiences that were part of who we had become as a unit, and we\u2019d already lost Josh, and so to have lost the AAirpass meant we could no longer travel.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 Like we did,\u201d she adds. \u201cBecause economically after Josh died, it was also a problem. Dad wasn\u2019t able to work at the same pace, speed and everything else that he had. So it was a huge loss, and it was shitty timing because it gave our family an opportunity to still travel, to find the joy in travel. \u2026 It took away a big part of our lives, and we already had a big part of our lives taken away. \u2026 So, it was a family trauma.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Me, left, and Natalie on an international flight in first class, late 1990s.\n\nWe\u2019ve done a remarkable job \u2013 at least in my opinion \u2013 of finding some way back to being a family unit after Josh died and my parents got divorced (which, having separated in the years after Josh died, was formalized in 2014), and Natalie and I have built an unbreakable bond to manage the vacancy lingering between our age gap.\n\nI ask Natalie if she has any resentment or anger about the AAirpass.\n\n\u201cAt first \u2026 I did have resentment toward the airline,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a time of a lot of loss in my life that my dad was having a hard time [with] and he wasn\u2019t as available to me as a father, so flying was like one of the only things that were normal in our life any more, and so when that was taken away, it was a really big loss for me and it was painful. I\u2019d say it took me a few years to get used to that change.\u201d\n\nDad still hasn\u2019t gotten used to it. The AAirpass was \u201chis pass to freedom\u201d, Mom says. \u201cThe trauma of taking that away, it grounded him, literally.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe seems to be, I don\u2019t know, is he running from things?\u201d Ernie adds. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of him as a settled person.\u201d Ernie notes the places my dad has lived \u2013 or tried to live \u2013 since my parents sold the house and got divorced. Berlin. Hong Kong. India. New York. Chicago. Australia. France.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if he stops moving,\u201d Ernie says, \u201cthen he\u2019s not him any more.\u201d\n\nWe inherit things from our kin. As much as I salivate over locking myself in a silent cave to write, I feel a wildly profound sense of purpose when I\u2019m traveling. As an internationally touring poet, performer and educator, when I am on tour, I am alive. I know how to operate an airport or bus terminal or Amtrak station or rental car. Natalie does too. People have come to me about their hatred or fear of flying. It\u2019s like a spa, I tell them. A certain amount of time in the sky that belongs only to you. Regardless of your seat.\n\nOf course, I recognize that because I was socialized to fly in first class, my feelings about travel are biased. Even though I fly economy now, even though my eyes can tell the difference, somehow my body does not. I am in the air. I am free above the world. I don\u2019t need fancy seats or legroom. I\u2019m just grateful to get a break from Earth.\n\nMy best friend, Chloe, recently asked me what my favorite airline is, given all the travel I do. I said, even though they so deeply impacted my family\u2019s life: American. I feel nostalgia. Loyalty. It\u2019s like having a crush on that kid who chases you around the playground, or never letting go of your first true love.\n\nMom still has skycaps\u2019 numbers in her phone. She, Natalie and I all still fly American, even though it hurts (and I have exactly 384,475 American miles at the time of publishing this piece, so if that dwindles unexpectedly, we\u2019ll all know why).\n\nWhen I talked to Lorraine, she told me she wanted to go to Fargo, North Dakota.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Left: Dad with the bellman at the Mauna Kea Hotel on the Big Island in Hawaii. Right: Dad in Hong Kong, where he shopped before a business meeting and was running late, early 1990s.\n\nI scream: \u201cLorraine! I\u2019ve never been to North Dakota! Fargo is on my bucket list!\u201d I\u2019ve made it to 47 states by now; Oregon and Alaska are still on the list, as well.\n\n\u201cOh my God, Caroline, I\u2019ve got a feeling we may end up going to Fargo, North Dakota,\u201d she says, \u201claughing our butts off and having a ball.\u201d\n\nI am yelping at this point. Literally hitting my leg and chair audibly. Suddenly, I feel like Dad must have felt talking to her \u2013 laughing, joking, dreaming up trips. Some people inherit money. Or trauma. A host of other things. I\u2019ve inherited plenty, but perhaps \u2013 more than anything \u2013 it\u2019s the wanderlust and desire to meet people and go places around the world.\n\nAfter we scheme about Fargo, she sends her love to my mother and sister, and says she\u2019d love Dad\u2019s number; she\u2019d love to catch up. I thank her and wish her a beautiful day.\n\n\u201cYou as well, Caroline,\u201d she says. \u201cI still love ya, so you take care, sweetheart.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you as well,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd what was it that you would say to my dad?\u201d\n\n\u201cBye now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then \u2018pay back\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would say, \u2018Pay later.\u2019\u201d\n\nI ask if we can try again.\n\n\u201cCaroline, bye now.\u201d\n\n\u201cPay later, Lorraine.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform Narratively.
