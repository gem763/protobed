For decades, vegetarians and vegans have been the main market for such proteins, but that\u2019s now changing as consumers seek to diversify diets and opt for more environmentally friendly options.\n\n\u201cWe are already looking beyond peas,\u201d Azoulay said in an interview at the Future Food-Tech Innovation & Investment summit in London. \u201cThe fava bean seems to be the most promising today, but it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d\n\nRoquette is also looking at expanding into processing lentils, mung beans, oats and rice, Azoulay said.\n\nThe closely held company extracts protein from peas, which is then used to make products such as vegan burgers, and has an agreement to supply Beyond Meat this year. To tap rising demand, it plans to more than double its pea-processing capacity from about 100,000 tons, and is building a plant in Canada\u2019s Manitoba province that\u2019s scheduled to start production late next year.\n\nRoquette could use its current plants if it expands into fava beans, which are also known as faba or broad beans, because processing uses the same techniques and facilities as peas.", "description": "Demand for plant-based proteins has been fueled by producers such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/a94bab27443c44a7bea25764b78707d1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
