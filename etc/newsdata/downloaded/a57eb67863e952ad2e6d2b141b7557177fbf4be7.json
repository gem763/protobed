Like wellness influencers calling berries \u201cnature\u2019s candy.\u201d Berries are literally among the top ten foods you can put in your mouth, but saying they\u2019re nature\u2019s candy is just setting everyone up for disappointment.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but bring that kind of negative thinking to the table when I cracked open my first bottle of bakuchiol, a.k.a. #naturesretinol. But as I sit here a month later with my skin glowing, I\u2019m mildly irked to admit that my annoyance at this dorky hashtag was unfounded.\n\nAs beauty\u2019s hot new \u201cnatural\u201d ingredient, bakuchiol has been popping up in loads of exciting new formulations, and the good news is that both clinical studies and anecdotal evidence support the claim that it\u2019s a dupe for retinol, the wonder drug for smooth and bouncy skin.\n\n\u201cBakuchiol is just as effective as retinol in stimulating collagen production,\u201d says Dr. Dendy Engelman, a board-certified dermatologic surgeon and New York-based celebrity dermatologist. Bakuchiol was formulated into a finished skin-care product and was tested in a clinical case study by twice-a-day facial application, according to Dr. Engelman. \u201cThe results showed that, after 12 weeks of treatment, significant improvement in lines and wrinkles, pigmentation, elasticity, firmness and overall reduction in photo-damage was observed.\u201d\n\nBut what truly makes bakuchiol worth its weight in gold is the fact that it comes with none of the baggage that retinol does. \u201cI\u2019ve created skin-care product prototypes using bakuchiol and I personally think it is a great natural alternative to retinol, especially for those with sensitive or dry skin prone to retinol irritation,\u201d says Rhonda M. Davis, cosmetic chemist for Alquemie Product Development Group.\n\nRetinol has been used for decades as one of the few reliable over-the-counter ingredients with solid anti-aging credentials (not to be confused with Retin-A or tretinoin, its turbo-charged version, which is available by prescription only). It\u2019s the Swiss Army knife of beauty \u2014 it promotes collagen production, encourages cell turnover, reduces wrinkles and dark spots, and even fights acne. But all that comes at a cost. Retinol is irritating to the skin, causing major side effects like irritation, peeling, redness, dryness, and sun sensitivity. Pregnant women can\u2019t use it for fear of causing birth defects in the fetus, and it\u2019s most often a no-go for people with sensitive skin.\n\nBakuchiol, on the other hand, has all of retinol\u2019s benefits, but you won\u2019t suffer that scorched-earth aftermath. As someone with sensitive skin, I can vouch for that. Even after a month of regular use, I\u2019ve experienced none of the tell-tale irritation that I\u2019d get from retinol after just a few days. I started by alternating a couple of bakuchiol serums: Herbivore\u2019s Bakuchiol Retinol Alternative Serum and Beautycounter\u2019s Countertime Tripeptide Radiance Serum; I also added Countertime Ultra Renewal Eye Cream to the mix. By now, I\u2019d run out of facial real estate but still had Omorovicza\u2019s Miracle Facial Oil to test, so I\u2019ve been deploying that on my limbs shamelessly, like a one-percenter.\n\nAfter a month, I found my skin smoother and firmer, with improved clarity and tone. The texture of my eye area is nearing baby\u2019s bottom territory, though some darkness remains. And since I wasn\u2019t restricted to night-only use (often the case with most retinol products), I could easily fit bakuchiol into my daily routine.\n\nWhich brings me to another plus in the bakuchiol versus retinol showdown: Bakuchiol can be used safely during the day without fear of causing sun sensitivity. Who am I even, I wondered, as I dripped bakuchiol oil on my legs in 90-degree weather and dabbed the cream around my eyes. The audacity of being out in the sun with a retinol-adjacent substance slathered all over me was breathtaking; I\u2019m too cowardly to ever have tried messing with retinol like this. (Full disclosure: I did sunscreen my face; the body I wasn\u2019t that fussed about).\n\nIn my limited anecdotal experience, there was one area I didn\u2019t see an improvement in: Bakuchiol doesn\u2019t seem to mimic retinol\u2019s deeply satisfying pore-unplugging action. To be fair, none of the studies I read claim this to be the case. According to Dr. Engelman, bakuchiol\u2019s antibacterial properties mean that it\u2019s great for those with acne and oily skin, and that the acne-prone should take advantage of its gentleness. \u201cThere are instances where you should avoid specific products when using a retinol, such as exfoliators, toners, benzoyl peroxide, as they can cause irritation. However, due to bakuchiol\u2019s natural composition it\u2019s safe to use with other products in your skin-care regimen,\u201d she says. Davis agrees, pointing to salicylic acid as a great add-on to combat acne and comedones. In other words, it\u2019s helpful when used with another acne-clearing aid.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering where this beauty unicorn has been your whole life, it turns out that the East has known about it all along. Bakuchiol is derived from the seeds of the Psoralea corylifolia or babchi plant, and has been used in Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine for centuries. \u201cBakuchi (as it\u2019s known in Ayurveda) has been used to treat leukoderma or vitiligo, hyperpigmentation, skin rashes and a host of other skin conditions,\u201d says Michelle Ranavat, the founder of Ayurveda-inspired beauty brand Ranavat Botanics. Ranavat, who is based in Los Angeles, learned about this ingredient in 2016 at an Ayurvedic conference in Kolkata, India, while researching ingredients. \u201cI was working on a brightening mask and I was looking for ingredients that helped create an even complexion. Bakuchi really stood out.\u201d Ranavat says since hyperpigmentation is such a huge area of focus especially for the South Asian community, learning about this ingredient was very exciting.\n\nTo know if you\u2019re getting a bakuchiol product with enough of the hero ingredient to make a difference, Davis advises you to read the fine print of the ingredient list. Bakuchiol should be listed before the preservatives (which most often show up as phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate, or ethylhexylglycerin). If it comes after those ingredients, you\u2019re only getting a small percentage, which won\u2019t do much for the skin.\n\nDavis thinks as chemists become more aware of bakuchiol\u2019s benefits and see more studies that back its clinical claims, it will become a major retinol contender and will be widely used in formulas. You might not have to wait that long \u2014 here\u2019s what\u2019s already out there.\n\nThe Best Bakuchiol Products\n\nThe Inkey List Bakuchiol This culty British beauty brand landed at Sephora a few months ago.
