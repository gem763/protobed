He also helped lay the groundwork for Essex\u2019s double of this season, and showed an ability to develop and integrate youth during his time at Chelmsford.\n\nSince joining England as bowling coach he has developed the bowling corps, which now looks more adaptable and consistent across different conditions.\n\nGiles\u2019 English desire and Kirsten\u2019s interview flop\n\nIt is understood that Ashley Giles always favoured Silverwood ahead of other candidates given his preference for an English coach, but it seemed last week that Gary Kirsten was favourite for the role.\n\nThe South African was the front-runner until the interview process \u2013 believed to have also included Ottis Gibson and Alec Stewart, who could not be tempted away from Surrey \u2013 but dropped away after disappointing in front of the three-man panel.\n\nKirsten was supposedly unwilling to commit all of his time to England, perhaps skipping certain tours, and would also have been more costly.\n\nThe appointment would also have further unsettled those in the county game. The ECB has earned little goodwill by appointing eight overseas coaches - including, incidentally, Kirsten - for the men\u2019s sides to take part in The Hundred next year.\n\nConversely, Silverwood produced a solid interview, displaying forward-thinking and sound planning to earn him the job.\n\nExisting relationships with players\n\nGiles particularly highlighted Silverwood\u2019s working relationships with England\u2019s white and red ball captains Eoin Morgan and Joe Root in his announcement.\n\nCarrying over a coach in such a manner, albeit in a different role, ensures there will be no ingratiation from a new man, and new boundaries will not need to be set.\n\nSilverwood will understand Morgan and Root\u2019s temperaments, and vice versa, which should ease the transition.\n\nEqually, those within the set-up seem to like Silverwood, amicably known as \u201cSpoons\u201d. Stuart Broad especially has talked up his impact, with the veteran seamer looking a rejuvenated figure this summer with a tweaked run-up and action.\n\nEnsuring continuity, but providing a fresh voice\n\nAlso talked up in the announcement was Silverwood\u2019s \u201cintimate understanding\u201d of England\u2019s \u201dstructures and systems.\u201d\n\nThat should ease the succession process, but given most agreed England could do with a fresh voice at the helm, some have suggested the appointment of Silverwood is a short-sighted and unexciting one.\n\nYet he is very much his own man, with his own ideas and thoughts, and given he only joined the set-up last year, not entirely allied to the Bayliss way as Paul Farbrace, for example, might have been had the former England assistant still been in the frame.\n\nBayliss was accused of being too hands off with the players, creating a laid back air that was often detrimental, and Silverwood will be aware of that, and may favour a slightly more hands-on approach.\n\nRepairing county connections\n\nAnother criticism of Bayliss was his general dismissal of the county game. The Australian, very much an outsider, was not at all embedded in the English domestic system, watching little county cricket.\n\nConversely, Silverwood very much is after such success at Essex, and will be able to draw on the opinions of former colleagues and combatants around the England game.\n\nHe will be aware of many of the players on the circuit, too, which should help those coming in to or on the fringes of the England set-up feel more at ease as they take their first international footsteps.\n\nWith the domestic structure undergoing significant changes at the moment, this should be a major positive for the health of the English game, with a closer relationship between the national team and the county system.", "description": "Chris Silverwood will be the new England cricket head coach, stepping up from his current role as bowling coach\u00a0to succeed Trevor Bayliss at the helm.
