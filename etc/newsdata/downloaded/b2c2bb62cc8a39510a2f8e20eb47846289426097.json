It was because I was doing a double-take. Mike Ashley was on screen, talking to the reporter.\n\nThis, for anyone who knows anything about the Sports Direct and Newcastle United boss, is a rare event. He keeps his public appearances to a minimum.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut there he was, looking relaxed, natural, speaking freely, and, I have to say, sounding authentic and genuine.\n\nThat qualification is necessary, because so much that is negative is written about Ashley. He\u2019s a bogeyman, a dark, bullying, brooding, mysterious force who runs the discounts chain and his other store chains as a personal fiefdom.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nHe cares little for the niceties, extolling the virtues of zero hours\u2019 labour, facing a \u00a3605m tax demand from the authorities in Belgium, falling out with his firm of auditors and struggling to find a replacement, buying up fading retailers when others will not touch them, appointing his young son-in-law to a high-flying strategic post. And that\u2019s just the recent coverage. And that, too, is merely the high street end.\n\nGo to the sports section, and you will find acres of newsprint devoted to Ashley\u2019s reign at Newcastle United, much of it scathing. He falls out with his managers, does not spend enough on the team, is seemingly content to preside over a big club that in footballing terms is going nowhere... the list of complaints levelled against him by the Geordie faithful is long and rancorous.\n\nBefore matches they will demonstrate against him, they hold up placards demanding his departure, sometimes in the most impolite of terms. It\u2019s been going on like this for years, and all the while, Ashley does precious little to engage with them.\n\nYet, after seeing him on the news bulletin, I was listening to the following morning\u2019s Today programme on Radio 4, and there he was again. He was describing how he is a major supporter of bricks and mortar retailing, and is from a generation that has never quite got digital, and how determined he is to make a fist of old-fashioned retailing. And jolly convincing and persuasive he came across, too.\n\nLikeable, almost. I hesitate there because much of the mud has stuck, and we\u2019ve heard little of his side of the story \u2013 not from him directly, anyway. But, as I watched and listened, I found myself thinking, why not? Mike, where have you been all this time?\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to him, but it was strictly for background and off-the-record. It\u2019s a shame, because if ever there was a business leader with plenty to say it was Ashley. He owned more than 60 per cent of a publicly-quoted retailer that possesses some of our best-known sports clothing and equipment brands, and has stores on virtually every major shopping stretch. He controlled one of our most famous football clubs, an iconic institution in its native northeast. He was intent on defying the gravitational pull besetting other shopkeepers as they battled the onset of online, and was busy snapping up chains, making him an enormous player in the industry.\n\nAny one of which would make Ashley a public figure. They gave him celebrity status, in the City, in retailing, and in football. Yet, his stock position was always to eschew any media interest.\n\nOf course, he\u2019s entitled to adopt that stance. He might be shy, he may believe he prefers to let the numbers and performance do the talking, he may assume he will never get a fair hearing (certainly where some football punditry is concerned, he could be justified in that supposition).\n\nAll of which are perfectly valid, and indeed, among the reasons trotted out frequently by bosses as to why they will lay themselves open to public questioning by journalists. For some, not many, such reticence is accepted, and they remain undamaged.\n\nIn Ashley\u2019s case, however, given the scale of his high-profile interests, and accompanying prominence, and the various accusations levelled against him, his decision to remain in the shadows backfired terribly on him. In fact, Ashley is living proof of how the media and accusers can run away with themselves if there is little by way of counter-balance. They filled the vacuum, and it was virtually entirely negative.\n\nHearing him, it\u2019s difficult to discern what he was so afraid of. He\u2019s strong and forthright in his views. He\u2019s got something to say, and, provided he keeps his temper, delivers it well.\n\nInvestors require detail and analysis from Ashley regarding their company\u2019s practices and future direction. The Newcastle supporters could do with being taken through the club\u2019s finances from his perspective (they assume that as a wealthy individual he should dip into his deep pockets more readily, but he may have a perfectly valid reason why that should not be the case). The stricken UK traditional retail industry urgently needs an advocate and a champion, someone who can persuade ministers and councils to act, to make shopping more attractive and accessible, and to level the playing field with online.\n\nAshley could be that person. He\u2019s articulate, sensible and unlike a lot of commentators he has actual experience and current skin in the game.
