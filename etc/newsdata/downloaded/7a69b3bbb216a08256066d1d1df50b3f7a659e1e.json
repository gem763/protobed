You are failing us, and the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you.\n\n'We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.'\n\nThe 56-year-old DJ continued to use the clip throughout the song, to cheers from the audience.\n\nHe shared a clip of the mash-up on social media with the caption: 'Right Here, Right Now... Greta Thunberg', followed by an earth emoji.\n\nScott Jackson, 40, of Middlesbrough, filmed Fatboy Slim incorporating Thunberg's speech in Gateshead.\n\nDuring the song, Thunberg's voice can be heard saying: 'People are dying.
