We have worked extensively with our partners in Kent to ensure that the county is as prepared as possible for any disruption to cross-Channel services,\u201d said Highways England\u2019s south-east operations director, Nicola Bell.\n\nThe disused Manston airport in Kent is also available as a lorry park should congestion occur, whatever the outcome of Brexit and election talks next week.\n\nWhile the rerouting of traffic causes disruption to local residents and businesses, Richard Burnett, the chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said he thought the move was wise.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s belt and braces. You don\u2019t know what curveball will be thrown at you in the coming days with Macron\u2019s position, so I think it\u2019s a sensible contingency plan.\u201d\n\nHighways England said it would stand down the operation if it was not needed next week.\n\nThe food industry, which relies heavily on the Calais-Dover route for fresh imports, said it was \u201cstill on a war footing\u201d as it believed a no-deal Brexit was a distinct possibility.\n\nIt fears the instigation of Operation Brock would be in itself disruptive as it could prevent delivery lorries getting through in good time.\n\nThe activation of the contingency plans came hours after it emerged that the government was also continuing with its taxpayer-funded adverts advising the public to prepare for Brexit on 31 October.", "description": "Operation Brock to cause major disruption around M20 despite likelihood of extension from EU", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87d6c8ab14c255478b1dfd6803d530d029dbf51/0_225_5304_3182/master/5304.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5646622d73c561534cf924c40f1b5c5b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
