The two have agreed to develop a prototype of such a vehicle. (Photo: Boeing Co)\n\nAircraft giant Boeing and German sports car maker Porsche are teaming up on a flying car \u2013 specifically, a self-driving air taxi.\n\nThe two companies announced that they'll work together to develop a concept for an upscale commercial passenger drone and to evaluate the potential market for such a vehicle.\n\nIs this just a flight of fancy, or is it a peek into the near future?\n\nBoeing and Porsche said they signed a Memorandum of Understanding \"to explore the premium urban air mobility market and the extension of urban traffic into airspace.\"\n\nUnder the deal, engineers from Boeing, Porsche and Aurora Flight Sciences \u2013 a Boeing subsidiary that designs and builds drones \u2013 will work together to design an autonomous, all-electric \"premium air mobility vehicle\" that can take off and land vertically. Once the design is done, the team will build and test a prototype.\n\nPorsche and Boeing envision an electric, autonomous passenger drone that would take off and land vertically.

Boeing NeXt works to create a \"next-generation mobility ecosystem\" in which autonomous and human-piloted air vehicles can safely coexist.\n\nSteve Nordlund, Boeing NeXt's general manager, said the partnership could accelerate the development of urban air mobility. \"This collaboration builds on our efforts to develop a safe and efficient new mobility ecosystem,\" he said.\n\nMakeup mogul: For Huda Kattan, beauty has become a $1.2 billion empire\n\nAs auto investors know, Porsche's automotive sales volumes are small, but its profits aren't: They're a major component of parent Volkswagen AG's bottom line. Though Porsches accounted for just 2.6% of the passenger vehicles Volkswagen Group delivered in the first half of 2019, Porsche contributed 31.6% of its parent's operating income from passenger vehicles over that period.\n\nPorsche and VW are looking for ways to ensure that flow of profits continues as the auto industry moves toward electric, connected and autonomous vehicles over the next couple of decades.\n\nPorsche Consulting took a close look at the potential market for electric passenger drones in a study last year. The study estimated that commercial passenger drones will start to come into service around 2025 and that by 2035, there could be about 23,000 of these air taxis in service, creating a market worth roughly $32 billion.\n\nThe study concluded that urban air mobility solutions could transport passengers more quickly and efficiently than ground transport and at lower cost, in time. (Note that the study's authors see passenger drones as a \"hub-to-hub\" solution, moving between established stations, rather than \"end-to-end\" like taxis. That limitation will be necessary to keep the skies from becoming overcrowded, they say.)\n\nSimply put, the deal with Boeing allows Porsche to explore possibilities for an upscale, premium electric passenger drone that is consistent with the brand's image and values, as part of a larger effort to figure out how Porsche can continue to generate strong profits as mobility technology evolves.\n\nJohn Rosevear has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.
