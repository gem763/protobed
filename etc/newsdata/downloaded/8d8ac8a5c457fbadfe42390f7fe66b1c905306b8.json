The key to doing this successfully, as L\u00fctke said on an August episode of NPR's \"How I Built This with Guy Raz,\" is outlining your expectations for the relationship at the start.\n\n\"I've always had a fantastic relationship with all the people who invested in the company, partly because I told them straight off the bat, saying, 'I'm not going to pretend to know things I don't know and I really hope you're going to help me in this journey,'\" L\u00fctke said on the episode. \"I think our relationship has always been, we were always on the same side of the table trying to build this thing.\"\n\nL\u00fctke told NPR that Shopify's investors were so in tune with the company's performance \"that they basically saved me from having to do a fundraising round.\"\n\n\"Ten months after the Series A, Jeremy and Trevor from Bessemer came to me and said, 'You are still massively constrained by money, how about instead of you spending a bunch of months of fundraising, we'll just quadruple the evaluation of the company and put much more money into this because you can grow this way faster,'\" L\u00fctke told Raz.\n\nL\u00fctke founded the e-commerce platform in 2004 after trying to launch his own small online business selling snowboards, according to Forbes. Fifteen years later, the company's $42.3 billion market cap makes it worth more than Twitter, Snap, Square, and Lyft, Forbes reported. Kylie Cosmetics and Allbirds both launched their online retail businesses using Shopify.\n\nRead more: The billionaire CEO of Uniqlo \u2014 and the richest person in Japan \u2014 says a woman would be the best person to take over his job\n\nInterpersonal issues \u2014 including those between founders and investors \u2014 are the leading cause of startup death, Yeshiva University Sy Syms School of Business dean Noam Wasserman previously told Business Insider's Shana Lebowitz and Sherin Shibu. Wasserman has studied 6,000 startups and 16,000 founders since the year 2000. He now advises founders and investors to set their expectations for their professional relationship early on, especially when it comes to tough issues \u2014 like how to divide equity \u2014 that often get pushed to the backburner.\n\nFor L\u00fctke, Shopify's success has already paid off: Forbes currently puts his net worth at $2.8 billion.", "description": "On an episode of NPR's \"How I Built This with Guy Raz,\" Tobias Lutke of Shopify talked about building strong relationships with VCs.", "authors": ["Taylor Nicole Rogers"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d5d6692cd978407dd28b2d2-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
