Both are terrible,\" Ganus added.\n\nRUSADA is in danger of being declared non-compliant by WADA a year after a suspension was lifted, which could put increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to exclude Russia from the Tokyo Games next year for failing to ensure that its athletes are clean.\n\nGanus said WADA was expecting an explanation from the sports ministry, and that RUSADA does not have access to the laboratory database.\n\n\"RUSADA works with at least 13 WADA-accredited anti-doping laboratories in the world, with five of which (are) in active mode. And we do not have and cannot have any access to their electronic databases,\" he said.\n\nGanus last month called for a complete overhaul in the country's sports management including the dismissal of state officials involved in the doping scandal.\n\nThe Moscow laboratory data is needed to open doping cases from major events including the 2014 Sochi Olympics, where anti-doping officials said Russian authorities took part in an elaborate scheme to cover up doping tests.\n\nRussia has denied running a state doping programme but has acknowledged that officials were involved in covering up doping cases.
