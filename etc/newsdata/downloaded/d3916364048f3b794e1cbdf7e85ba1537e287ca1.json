However, Boris Johnson has neither the intention nor ability to negotiate a deal or protect jobs and communities across the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell added that he thought Johnson\u2019s plans were \u201ca cynical attempt to force through a no-deal Brexit\u201d.\n\nOpposition parties were united in rejecting the prime minister\u2019s proposal for a deal, which would involve Northern Ireland leaving the EU customs union, necessitating customs checks.\n\nTom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, said: \u201cIt is ludicrous to think that somehow Boris Johnson believes the answer to ensuring no Irish border is to create two. Not to mention it goes against the Conservative government\u2019s own promises that there would be no return of any border infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIrish officials dismiss Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit offer as 'unacceptable' Read more\n\n\u201cIt looks like these proposals are designed to fail and that the UK government is intent on pursuing a no-deal [Brexit],\u201d said Michael Russell, a Scottish National party MSP and the constitutional affairs secretary. \u201cThis plan does not appear to be a serious basis for negotiation.\u201d\n\nThe SNP has been keen to remove Johnson by tabling a vote of no confidence in the government and triggering a general election. But in their regular meetings, opposition figures have agreed to hold off until the prime minister has been forced by the Benn law to request a Brexit delay.\n\nThe legislation, drawn up by a cross-party group of MPs, including Keir Starmer and Dominic Grieve, is aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Despite Johnson\u2019s hints that he could circumvent it, the rebels believe it is watertight.\n\nOne proposal that has been discussed is a short-term caretaker government to extend the Brexit deadline and then trigger a general election.\n\nHowever, the parties have squabbled about who could lead such a government. Labour insists it would have to be Jeremy Corbyn, as the leader of the official opposition but Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has suggested he should step aside in favour of a less contentious figure.\n\nQuick guide Why is the Irish border a stumbling block for Brexit? Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts of cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

SNP sources described the Lib Dems as the \u201croadblock\u201d to removing Johnson before 31 October.\n\nBut a senior Lib Dem source said: \u201cThe only people who currently think a vote of no confidence is a good idea are the SNP and Boris Johnson. They are putting their desire for an election above what is good for the country, which is a totally reckless course of action.\u201d\n\nJohnson tried to trigger a snap election earlier this month after the Benn law was passed, but parliament twice voted against the idea.\n\nHowever, Labour has said it is ready to support a general election once an extension to article 50 has been agreed and the threat of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October has been lifted.", "description": "Opposition parties reject PM\u2019s proposals and claim he is trying to force through no-deal Brexit", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/914daa71a4800e063a523fc00507880cc9301155/386_386_3379_2028/master/3379.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=98779d8eff0cfd504959b8a2510af872"}
