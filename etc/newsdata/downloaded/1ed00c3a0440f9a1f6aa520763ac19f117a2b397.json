After a short conversation in which Rudd admits he hasn\u2019t watched Game of Thrones and explains Living With Yourself as \u201cthe cornhole of TV,\u201d it\u2019s time to get to the part of the interview when Rudd gives the signal for O\u2019Brien to roll a clip from the show. But as is tradition anytime Rudd visits O\u2019Brien since he started the bit in 2004, Rudd\u2019s clip isn\u2019t from Living With Yourself at all, but instead from the 1988 movie Mac and Me. It\u2019s the dumbest long-running bit on late-night TV, which is why it\u2019s also just the best. \u201cI love how many people in the audience were like \u2018Here we go!\u2019\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cWell,\u201d Rudd says, \u201cclearly many people have seen the trailer.\u201d\n\nRelated", "description": "During his latest visit to Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s TBS late-night show, Paul Rudd promoted his new Netflix series \u2018Living With Yourself\u2019 by continuing his long-running tradition of pranking O\u2019Brien by rolling clips from \u2018Mac and Me.\u2019", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/23/23-paul-rudd-conan.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
