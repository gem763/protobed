Ozzie Valdez said of the meeting. \u201cIt was determining how the video would jeopardize anything.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the city released thousands of pages of records related to the investigation of the McDonald shooting conducted by the city\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG).\n\nThe records primarily concern the 16 officers Inspector General Joe Ferguson recommended be disciplined for their roles in covering for former CPD Officer Jason Van Dyke, who fired the 16 shots that killed the African American teenager in 2014.\n\nThe documents offer an even closer look into the shooting and subsequent investigations that have dominated Chicago\u2019s consciousness for nearly five years.\n\nAmong the inspector general\u2019s findings: Current CPD Supt. Eddie Johnson \u2014 who Emanuel tapped for the job in an effort to quell tensions between the CPD and city\u2019s African American community \u2014 saw the shooting video before it was publicly released and believed the shooting to be justified.\n\nFerguson\u2019s office also found that Van Dyke repeatedly submitted false reports, made false statements and disobeyed orders from supervisors while the office was conducting its investigation.\n\n\u201cVan Dyke\u2019s false reports, false statements, and material omissions all served to exaggerate the threat McDonald posed,\u201d the reports released by the Office of the Inspector General state.\n\n\u201cVan Dyke failed to cooperate with the OIG\u2019s investigation, after being properly called upon to do so and in direct violation of a superior\u2019s order, by refusing to answer OIG\u2019s questions in his interview. Van Dyke\u2019s statements can be seen as a deliberate attempt to establish the false narrative that a back-pedaling Van Dyke shot an onrushing McDonald in response to McDonald\u2019s potentially deadly knife attack.\u201d\n\nVan Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder last year and sentenced to more than six years in prison. Three other officers were charged with covering up the shooting, but they were acquitted.\n\nDan Herbert, Van Dyke\u2019s attorney, issued a statement Wednesday saying the inspector general\u2019s report \u201cconfirms our contention throughout these court proceedings.\u201d\n\n\u201cJason Van Dyke was taking the fall to protect the politicians and police command staff who determined the shooting was justified before realizing there would be a huge public outcry,\u201d Herbert said.\n\nThe OIG report on Anthony Wojcik \u2014 the lieutenant at the scene of the shooting who retired from the department in 2016 \u2014 was especially concerned with his handling of reports by detectives who interviewed several civilian eyewitnesses the night of the shooting.\n\nWojcik said the reports had gone missing, but assured one detective the department would find them. He told several others that the original reports were destroyed when he spilled coffee on them, but Wojcik said he\u2019d been able to \u201crecreate\u201d the reports, and that he had disposed of the originals.\n\nWojcik refused to be interviewed by OIG investigators, according to the report, first asserting that the inspector general\u2019s subpoena power did not apply to retired city employees. When a judge ruled that Wojcik would have to sit for an interview, his lawyer said Wojcik would assert his Fifth Amendment rights and refuse to answer questions.\n\nThough they were not criminally charged, three other officers and a sergeant who were on scene the night of the shooting were fired earlier this year for allegedly lying to cover up the shooting. They have filed lawsuits fighting their terminations.\n\nAmong the lost interview reports were those of Det. Beth Svec, who talked witnesses who were largely mortified by Van Dyke\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cThat omission is particularly egregious because ... one of the witnesses Svec interviewed, claimed he told CPD that night that he saw the shooting and further described it as an \u201cexecution,\u2019\u201d the report states.\n\nThe OIG recommended the firing of 11 officers who were at the scene of McDonald\u2019s shooting or involved in the subsequent investigation.\n\nAmong those was Janet Mondragon, who is among the four officers suing to overturn their termination by the police board. The OIG said her credibility was \u201cseverely limited by her uncooperativeness.\u201d Mondragon answered questions by saying she did not remember or did not recall roughly 145 times, according to the inspector general\u2019s report, and gave the answer \u201cnot that I recall\u201d more than a dozen times. Mondragon has claimed she was looking down while placing her vehicle transmission into park when McDonald was shot \u2014 even though her gearshift lever was on the steering wheel.\n\nDespite her poor memory, Mondragon remembered being served pizza at Area Central.\n\n\u201cIt defies belief that Mondragon does not remember whether or not she had seen anyone shot, but has a clear recollection of pizza,\u201d the OIG wrote.\n\nThe report for Thomas Gaffney \u2014 one of the first officers to encounter McDonald the night of the shooting \u2014 keyed on the officer\u2019s failure to make sure the in-car camera and microphones on the SUV was functioning at the start of his shift.\n\nGaffney told investigators he was not aware the camera was not recording \u2014 CPD technicians determined that there was a problem related to the system processing another large video file that prevented it from saving new footage \u2014 and admitted that he and his partner, Joe McElligott, did not wear the microphones synced to the camera.\n\nGaffney was among the officers charged in a conspiracy case for allegedly making false statements in his reports on the shooting. Alongside co-defendants Det. David March and Van Dyke\u2019s partner, Joseph Walsh, Gaffney was acquitted at a bench trial last year. Gaffney returned to duty as a patrol officer soon after the not-guilty verdict, and never faced discipline from the department.\n\nFormer CPD Deputy Chief David McNaughton was the On-Call Incident Commander the night of the shooting. The OIG recommended he be fired for, among other things, approving false reports and relaying a knowingly false statement to the CPD\u2019s Office of News Affairs.\n\n\u201cMcNaughton\u2019s creation and endorsement of false statements, despite objective evidence to the contrary, all served to establish a false narrative that McDonald initiated an attack on Officers Walsh and Van Dyke,\u201d the OIG said.\n\nEugene Roy, the former chief of Area Central Detectives, \u201clet stand reports containing materially false statements and conclusions despite viewing video of the shooting within hours of its occurrence and possessing ongoing knowledge of the investigation as it unfolded.\u201d\n\nRoy and McNaughton were among the officers the OIG recommended be fired, but both retired from the CPD before any disciplinary measures could be brought against them.\n\nThe City Council OK\u2019d the release of the reports last month, further allowing for Chicago\u2019s corporation counsel to make public reports issued by Ferguson\u2019s office whenever they involve \u201csustained findings regarding conduct that either is associated with a death or is, or may be, a felony as defined in the Illinois Criminal Code and is of a compelling public interest.\u201d\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police, the union representing the CPD\u2019s rank-and-file officers, blasted the reports\u2019 imminent release last month as \u201clittle more than a political witch hunt.\u201d", "description": "On Wednesday, the city released thousands of pages of records related to the investigation of the McDonald shooting conducted by the city\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG).", "authors": ["Sam Charles", "Andy Grimm", "Jon Seidel", "Gordon Wittenmyer", "Dale Bowman", "Tom Schuba", "Matthew Hendrickson", "Jermaine Nolen", "Nancy Malitz - For The Sun-Times", "Sun-Times Wire"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6JItmo0GLWHhw_O_-iXlQsXZfOU=/0x143:1895x1135/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16135703/chicago_police_laquan_mcdonald_72541347.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
