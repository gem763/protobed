Josmar Taveras, USA TODAY\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the roughly 15 million taxpayers who asked the Internal Revenue Service for an extension on filing your federal taxes in April, time\u2019s almost up.\n\nThe federal tax extension deadline hits Oct. 15.\n\nBy submitting Form 4868 as of April 15, you gave yourself an extra six months to file your taxes. If you miss the October deadline, you\u2019re likely to face a hefty penalty for failing to file.\n\nMore than one in 10 taxpayers asked for an extension this year, according to IRS statistics. Typically, taxpayers who asked for one needed more time to gather tax documents, or they had complicated taxes that required additional prep work. On top of that, taxpayers are grappling with the ins-and-outs of the new tax code, which President Donald Trump signed into law in December 2017.\n\nBetter to get a refund or not?Should you aim for a refund or not?\n\nTax law changes: Taxes 2019: When to file and what big changes to expect\n\nHave you got the new tax code all figured out? (Photo: GETTY IMAGES)\n\n\u201cThere were a lot more extensions this year really due to the complexity of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d the law that overhauled the tax code, says Bill Smith, managing director for CBIZ MHM\u2019s National Tax Office.\n\nHe says, \u201cIn October, the key is to make sure you have your documents together. If you are missing anything, you will have to get the documents very quickly \u2013 you are running out of time.\u201d\n\nTax extension due date: What to know\n\nSome taxpayers mistakenly believe the six-month extension provides an extra half-year to pay any taxes owed to the IRS, says Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert with TurboTax.\n\n\u201cIt's a misconception, and we always emphasize that \u2013 it's just an extension to file. The IRS wants you to pay 90% of what you owe\u201d by April 15, she says.\n\nTaxpayers who owe the IRS should have sent in an estimated payment before the regular tax deadline in the spring. If they didn\u2019t \u2013 or low-balled what they owe the taxman \u2013 they could be on the hook for an underpayment penalty.\n\nDealing with an underpayment penalty\n\nIf your tax return shows you didn\u2019t pay at least 90% of your tax bill by April 15, the IRS will sock you with a penalty of 0.5% per month on the unpaid amount until the rate reaches 25%, Greene-Lewis says. In other words, it could take about four years to hit that limit \u2013 unless you've failed to file your taxes, in which case you'll face a higher penalty (see below.) The IRS charges interest on the amount you owe, although the rate varies by quarter.\n\nEstimating correctly could be tricky for taxpayers who hadn\u2019t gathered all their documents by the April deadline. Some tax preparers who wanted to help clients avoid the penalty may have overestimated what was owed by clients who filed extensions, Smith says.\n\n\u201cIf you overpaid, you'll get it back when we file the return,\u201d he says. \u201cThat's not the worst thing \u2013 the worst thing is there are people right now putting off filing or getting the info they need\u201d to file before Oct. 15.\n\nIf you miss the Oct. 15 deadline\n\nTaxpayers who don't file by Oct. 15 can face even higher penalties, tax experts say. The IRS will sock you with a \u201cfailure to file\u201d penalty of 5% a month on your unpaid tax bill for up to five months, maxing out at 25%. If you face penalties for both underpayment (see above) and failure to file, the IRS will charge the higher fee of 5% until that penalty hits 25% after five months, but Smith notes that the underpayment penalty will continue to run at 0.5% per month beyond that.\n\nIf you owe either penalty, the IRS will calculate your fine after you file your return, says Eric Bronnenkant, head of tax for financial services firm Betterment.\n\n\u201cPay what you owe, and let the IRS send you a bill for the amount of interest and penalties that you owe,\u201d Bronnenkant says. \u201cYou'll want to watch for that in the mail.\u201d\n\nIf you can\u2019t pay what you owe right away, the IRS will work out a payment plan. You can learn more about those here.\n\nLast-minute retirement savings\n\nSome business owners and self-employed workers may still be able to sock away retirement savings for the 2018 tax year if they have a simplified employee pension individual retirement account, also known as a SEP-IRA, which is geared toward these workers, tax experts say.\n\nThat\u2019s because SEP-IRAs allow prior-year contributions as late as Oct. 15 \u2013 as long as an extension was filed. Traditional and Roth IRAs don\u2019t enjoy this benefit, Bronnenkant says.\n\nIf you qualify for a SEP-IRA but don\u2019t have one, you \u201ccan set one up today and fund that contribution\u201d before the October deadline, he says. Because retirement contributions are tax deductible, this can help reduce your tax liability.\n\nTax penalty relief\n\nLastly, the IRS may waive penalties in certain cases, such as taxpayers who have suffered through a natural disaster. There\u2019s also relief through the agency's \u201cfirst-time penalty abatement\u201d program, CBIZ\u2019s Smith says.\n\nThe IRS says this program is open to taxpayers who haven\u2019t paid penalties in the previous three years, among other criteria.\n\nSmith says, \u201cIf you have been a good boy or girl, you can get the penalty waved.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Millions of Americans file their taxes annually.
