(TSX-V:GTEC) (OTCQB:GGTTF) (FRA:1BUP) (\u201cGTEC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), is pleased to announce that pursuant to the sale of certain assets, as previously announced on September 4, 2019 (the \u201cTransaction\u201d), between Cannabis Cowboy Inc (\u201cCCI\u201d) and Fire & Flower Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Flower Holdings Corp. (\u201cFFHC\u201d) (TSX:FAF), that the Transaction has been completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoan Repayment\n\nUpon the closing of the Transaction, CCI has settled GTEC\u2019s outstanding $4.06 million debt, in a cash repayment (the \u201cRepayment\u201d). The Repayment will strengthen GTEC\u2019s balance sheet as the Company continues its near-term initiatives of completing the development of its two facilities currently under construction, with the expectation to increase its annual production output from its current 4,000 kg output to approximately 9,000 kg in 2020. The Repayment also reinforces GTEC\u2019s ability to fulfill its debt obligations due in the second half of 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis transaction exemplifies our dedication to strengthening our balance sheet with a disciplined and non-dilutive approach, while realizing profits from non-core assets. This strategy demonstrates management\u2019s commitment to be aligned with our shareholders,\u201d said Norton Singhavon, Founder, Chairman and CEO of GTEC. \u201cWe are confident that the strengthened balance sheet will accelerate the development of our core cultivation business and accelerate our transition to profitability.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCannabis Cowboy Divestment\n\nConcurrent to the Transaction, GTEC and Cannabis Cowboy had entered into a Share Purchase Agreement where CCI would repurchase all of GTEC\u2019s interest, equal to 25% of CCI (the \u201cDivestment\u201d). As consideration for the Divestment, CCI will pay GTEC a sum of $1 million, payable as follows: (i) $800,000 in shares of FFHC at 10-day volume weighted average price leading to the signing of the definitive agreements related to the aforementioned Transaction; and (ii) a $200,000 Promissory Note to be re-paid in cash. The Promissory Note will have a two-year term and bear an interest rate of 8% per annum and is secured against Cannabis Cowboy\u2019s BC assets. The shares of FFHC will be subject to a statutory 4 month and a day hold. The Divestment is expected to close on or about October 10, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Rationale\n\nAs previously announced, GTEC is divesting of non-core/non-operational assets to strengthen its balance sheet, while focusing the organization\u2019s resources on the cultivation and extraction of premium indoor flower and its derivatives, with the mandate to establish long-term brand equity and consumer loyalty by distributing premium quality cannabis products.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout GTEC\n\nGTEC Holdings is a specialized cannabis company dedicated to cultivating ultra-premium quality cannabis in purpose-built indoor facilities.
