Using the flaw, hackers could load spyware onto a phone through a video call, even if the person never answered the call. Citizen Lab, the organization that discovered the vulnerability, said at the time that the attack was being used to target journalists and human rights advocates. The spyware used in the attacks, called Pegasus, was developed by the Israel-based NSO Group, whose software has been employed by repressive governments around the world.\n\nWhen the WhatsApp flaw was revealed, NSO Group said it wasn\u2019t involved in the direct use of its software, and merely provided it to governments. But in a Washington Post opinion article published today, WhatsApp head Will Cathcart says the company has evidence of NSO Group\u2019s direct involvement in the attack. \u201cNow, we are seeking to hold NSO accountable under U.S. state and federal laws, including the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,\u201d Cathcart writes.\n\nAccording to Cathcart, Facebook-owned WhatsApp linked servers and services used in the attack with NSO Group, and also uncovered evidence tying WhatsApp accounts used in the attack to the spyware vendor. \u201cWhile their attack was highly sophisticated,\u201d Cathcart writes, \u201ctheir attempts to cover their tracks were not entirely successful.\u201d About 1,400 devices were infected by the malicious code, according to WhatsApp.\n\nIn a related announcement, Citizen Lab said it has been working with WhatsApp since the attack to identify suspected targets.\n\n\u201cIn the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them,\u201d NSO Group said in a statement. The company went on to say it takes action when one of its products is used for purposes other than fighting crime or terrorism.\n\nWhatsApp is asking a court to stop NSO Group from taking similar action in the future and to award damages. \u201cWhatsApp will continue to do everything we can within our code, and within the courts of law, to help protect the privacy and security of our users everywhere,\u201d Cathcart writes.\n\nUpdate, 5:37 PM ET: Includes statement from NSO Group spokesperson.\n\nCorrection, 4:25PM ET: An earlier version of this article stated that Citizen Lab attributed the attack to NSO Group. The organization cited WhatsApp in its announcement.", "description": "WhatsApp is suing notorious spyware vendor NSO Group, saying the company was actively involved in hacking users of the encrypted chat service owned by Facebook.
