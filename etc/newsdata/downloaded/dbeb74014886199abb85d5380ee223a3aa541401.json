At the conclusion of the meeting the committee will decide if the Federal Funds Rate needs to be cut. That rate directly affects interest rates for mortgages and credit cards as well as other rates.\n\nThe Kansas City Federal Reserve President says the economy is in \u201cgood place\u201d echoing the words of the Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell from Friday.\n\nHowever, George says inflation running just under target is no reason to cut rates again saying,\u201dIn the midst of the longest business cycle expansion in history, inflation running a few tenths of a percent below 2 percent is, in itself, not a compelling justification for providing additional monetary policy accommodation.\" She adds that people on \u201cMain Street\u201d do not see inflation running under the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2 percent for a prolonged time as a problem.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAnother voting member of the FOMC, St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, believes the Federal Reserve needs to get inflation back to the 2 percent target. He dissented the 25 basis point rate cut, advocating a more drastic 50 basis point rate cut at the last meeting. In his justification he says that manufacturing in the United States may be in a recession because of trade uncertainty.\n\nGeorge points to the uncertainty as a potential reason for the low inflation. She says in the speech to the National Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting that the trade uncertainty and global economic slowdown could cause firms in the United States to be more cautious, artificially keeping inflation domestically and around the globe low.\n\n\u201cRather than focusing too narrowly on achieving a precise point target of 2 percent inflation, I find it more realistic to accept that there will be both temporary and persistent fluctuations around this long-run target.\u201d George says. Adding inflation fluctuations, \u201c\u2026should be tolerated, depending on broader economic conditions.\u201d\n\nShe does leave the door open for a rate cut if the economic data shows weakness, \u201cIf weaker global demand and trade policy uncertainty were to materially weaken my modal outlook for growth, providing additional monetary accommodation may be warranted.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nWeakness could not be seen in the latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics which shows the unemployment rate falling to low of 3.5 percent.
