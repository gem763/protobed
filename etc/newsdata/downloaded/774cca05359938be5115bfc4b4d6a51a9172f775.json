To date I have received few reports outlining what has actually transpired and not assisting government in making sound policy decisions ... I have not received any tangible plan and improvement of product strategy to ensure that we timeously detect, analyse and disseminate actionable intelligence to the client and to other stakeholders.\u201d\n\nDlodlo asked to be presented with an engagement strategy on how best to address the issue.\n\n\u201cThe strategy should ensure that intelligence is at the centre of forewarning and in assisting government to take right policy positions.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, Muofhe hit back in a strong letter to Dlodlo, defending his work.\n\n\u201cSince I assumed responsibility as director of the domestic branch, shortcomings identified were attended to and addressed on a continuous basis. The products received thus far have assisted government to arrest some volatile situations, which would have been worse had it not been for the timely intervention of the intelligence services. This is also borne by the fact that the minister of police, Mr Bheki Cele, publicly thanked the intelligence services. He indicated that the SA Police Service interventions were successful due to cooperation with the intelligence.\u201d\n\nIt was in the same letter that Muofhe referred to his refusal to intercept communication of a target as directed by the minister without the approval of a judge.\n\nNews24 has published details of the dispute between Muofhe and Dlodlo.\n\nThe minister has denied that she issued such an instruction, but those close to her argue that, under section 7 of the Rica Act, interceptions on an emergency basis are allowed, and the worsening violence would merit the invocation of such powers.\n\nCity Press understands that Muofhe\u2019s boasts about praise from the president have created the impression that he wields far more influence than the minister.\n\nTalk in intelligence circles is that if the conflict is not contained, Ramaphosa would move to remove the minister rather than Muofhe, who was handpicked by the president for the position.\n\nMuofhe, an advocate, was a key player in the CR17 campaign that led to Ramaphosa winning the ANC presidency.\n\nMuofhe was previously chief governance officer for the Special Investigating Unit and had recently occupied a position as adviser to Dlodlo\u2019s predecessor, Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba.\n\nJafta is a veteran of the intelligence services.\n\nCity Press has learnt that if mediation fails, Ramaphosa may have to choose between a minister he appointed and who has clout in the ANC and military veteran circles, and a director-general who is his close ally, and his eyes and ears on \u201cthe farm\u201d, as the intelligence headquarters is known.\n\nAside from the dispute over how intelligence related to the xenophobic attacks was handled, City Press understands that there is also growing conflict over the restructuring taking place inside the agency.\n\nBecause of the constant changing of the guard at the helm \u2013 particularly during Jacob Zuma\u2019s presidency \u2013 many senior operatives have been \u201cdisplaced\u201d.\n\nThis refers to officials from whom responsibility has been removed, but who continue to earn salaries without any new responsibilities.\n\nThis has necessitated a restructuring, but City Press has learnt that the minister and her senior officials do not see eye to eye on the process. The restructuring has created deep tension in the service.\n\nDue to start at the beginning of this month, the restructuring is now on hold because of the ongoing conflict.\n\nMuofhe told Dlodlo in the letter that, if she was not happy with the performance, she would be advised to go to the inspector-general of intelligence for investigation.\n\nIn terms of the Intelligence Services Oversight Act, the inspector-general monitors compliance and exercises oversight over the SSA.\n\nDlodlo\u2019s spokesperson, Mava Scott, warned City Press that it was not supposed to be in possession of the information.\n\n\u201cIt is illegal to have that information. Whoever gave you that information has breached security. It is a crime. We are going to take steps to correct that.\u201d\n\nHe refused to take questions or to comment on the merits of the story.\n\nHow do you feel about the state\u2019s security sector being in apparent disarray?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword SECURITY and tell us what you think.
