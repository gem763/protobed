Two dozen more were pulled after German police raided the place on Thursday, on suspicion that a number of the paintings signed, \"A. Hitler,\" are forgeries.\n\nImagine acquiring the technical proficiency to counterfeit a work of art, only to use those skills not to fabricate a fictitious Picasso, El Greco, Gauguin or Georgia O'Keeffe \u2014 but a watercolor by a highly mediocre painter who went on to exterminate 6 million Jews and try to enslave the world.\n\nIn his 20s, the future Fuhrer was twice rejected by Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts for what they called his \"unfitness for painting.\" Hitler stayed on in the city to study with private teachers and tried to sell his paintings and postcard sketches for spare change.\n\nWe asked Jerry Saltz, the Pulitzer Prize-winning art critic, for his appraisal of A. Hitler's artwork.\n\n\"Physically and spatially dead,\" Jerry told us, \"generic academic realism, the equivalent of mediocre exercises in aping good penmanship. He was an adequate draftsman, utterly unimaginative, and made the equivalent [of] greeting cards.\"\n\nThen why would someone want to create a forgery of a Hitler painting?\n\nThe opening bid for one of those Hitler paintings is more than $50,000.\n\nNot because it's that good, but because it's painted by history's great monster.\n\nThat same auction house sold 14 Hitler paintings in 2015 for almost a half million dollars; auctioneers say their bidders were from all over Europe, China and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nWhy would anyone who could afford to bid so high spend so much good money on a bad painting by an evil man?\n\nIt is tempting to believe that each and every Hitler artwork should be tossed onto the trash heap of history and burned. But critics and scholars remind us it's important to be able to see Hitler's middling and unremarkable paintings to try to find clues into his monstrous mind and malicious life.\n\nYou see the soft landscapes that A. Hitler painted, of thatched-roof houses, old stone churches, slim flowers and snowy countrysides, and realize one of the most frightening facts of all.\n\nHistory's great monster was human.", "description": "NPR's Scott Simon reflects on why someone would create a forgery of a painting by Adolf Hitler after German police raided an art house in Nuremberg with suspected counterfeits painted by the F\u00fchrer.", "authors": ["Scott Simon"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/02/08/gettyimages-1095334228_wide-34c372b45cafbefa340ff97119f343912ce61013.jpg?s=1400"}
