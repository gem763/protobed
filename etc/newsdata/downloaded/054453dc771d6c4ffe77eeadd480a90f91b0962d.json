They're in multiple different languages. All around the border of the geyser, there are rules saying that it is very dangerous, that the ground is unstable and very fragile.\"\n\nKimberly Guilliams/Facebook\n\nIt's not the first time someone has been caught trespassing at Old Faithful.\n\nGabriel Villalva, 27, of Greeley, Colorado, was arrested after park visitors' video recorded him getting dangerously close to the geyser's spout in September 2018. The video, which was passed on to park rangers, not only showed Villalva walking up to the geyser, which spews 200-degree boiling water about every hour, but sticking his head in the spout.\n\nVillalva pleaded guilty in November to disorderly conduct and thermal trespassing. He was sentenced to five years' probation and banned from Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks for five years, officials said.\n\nOn the Yellowstone National Park website visitors are warned about the dangers of venturing close to the geyser, saying, \"burns from thermal features are a common cause of serious injury and death in the park.", "description": "A visitor took photos and turned in two men trespassing at Old Faithful.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/old-faithful-2-ht-er-190915_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
