West Palm is good for us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, forgive local fans coming to a World Series watch party this week at the park for feeling a bit conflicted. Major League Baseball has given permission to let them onto the field for free Friday night to see Game 3 on the video board.\n\nThere\u2019s even been some talk around the diamonds of splitting Houston and Washington jerseys down the middle, then sewing the opposing halves together to create a hybrid NatRos shirt for employees to wear while watching the game.\n\n\u201cWe work 50/50 for each team so we root for both equally,\u201d grounds crew chief Matt Eggerman said. \u201cIn my book, we\u2019ve already reached our goal.\u201d\n\nThe Astros and Nationals began the year with workouts as neighbors, and they met in the exhibition opener. Jake Marisnick was the first batter of the game and homered off Nationals ace Max Scherzer, the winning pitcher Tuesday night.\n\nThe clubs played six times last spring, with Washington going 5-1.\n\n\u201cWe see them in spring training so much,\u201d Astros star Alex Bregman said.\n\nThis World Series matchup is the first in the modern era to feature teams that share a common spring training site.\n\nIn 1942, the St. Louis Cardinals and New York Yankees met after playing their spring games in the same park in St. Petersburg, but they worked out at different sites.\n\nSeven spring training sites currently host two teams, including Camelback Ranch in Glendale, Arizona, home of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago White Sox.\n\nThat complex was one of Matt Slatus\u2019 stops during an 18-year career in baseball that brought him a few weeks ago to the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches as its new general manager.\n\nMoving purposely from one spot to another, Slatus paused to reassure a flustered new staffer that Monday wasn\u2019t indicative of a normal offseason day.\n\nNever before has a complex been guaranteed to be the spring home of baseball\u2019s champion even before the World Series\u2019 ceremonial first pitch, and that has the Ballpark buzzing with energy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cool time,\u201d Slatus said. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time. It\u2019s a pinch-me time. It\u2019s kind of, oh my goodness, how did this happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been part of a World Series, and now we\u2019re going double barrel here one month in with both these clubs,\u201d Slatus said. \u201cThe 2019 world champion will open spring training right here in 2020.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll be the second time in three years the complex can make that claim. A graphic painted on the wall outside Houston\u2019s administrative offices, easily visible beyond the stadium\u2019s left field foul pole, reminds visitors the Astros won the 2017 World Series - the same year both teams opened the facility.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 side is impatiently awaiting its first piece of celebratory artwork.\n\nAn additional graphic will be visible inside the ark next Feb. 22 when the spring training schedule opens with a night game - naturally, it\u2019s a World Series rematch.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t script it any better,\u201d Slatus said.\n\nThis week, a few minor leaguers have been working out at the complex. There also was the 14-under Perfect Game Fall World Championship game, with teams from Texas and Florida competing on the same diamond that Soto, Bregman and other big leaguers used.\n\n\u201cPlaying on the same field as they play on, it\u2019s cool,\u201d Florida infielder Anthony Espinoza said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "All of the Houston Astros and Nationals see a lot of each other starting every February -- they share the complex at the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches.
