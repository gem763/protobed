The details\u2014whether there is an income cap for eligibility; whether the government covers tuition costs up front before grants; whether there are merit or GPA requirements\u2014will determine who will benefit the most, and who will pay for such a plan.\n\nA subtle tweak from Kamala Harris this past January encapsulates the coming debate over the scope of the party\u2019s proposals. The senator from California, while making formal what many had suspected\u2014that she would be running for president\u2014tweaked her language in a slight but potentially significant way. She was supporting free college, but not just any free college: She was pushing for debt-free college. \u201cI am running to declare education is a fundamental right,\u201d she said, \u201cand we will guarantee that right with universal pre-K and debt-free college.\u201d\n\nWhat was the difference? Free college is a catchall term for a range of college-affordability plans. There are \u201ctuition-free\u201d programs, where the government\u2014or an institution\u2014covers tuition but not the other expenses, such as books, housing, or food; then there are debt-free college plans, which aim to address all those other costs. Harris was getting specific; and she was doing so with the kind of free-college idea\u2014debt-free\u2014that equity advocates tend to prefer.\n\nOftentimes, tuition-free models are \u201clast dollar,\u201d which means that the government covers tuition after all other grant aid\u2014such as Pell Grants, which are federal grants for low-income students\u2014is applied. Oftentimes those grants cover the full tuition at community colleges, and students aren\u2019t able to use that money for things like books, housing, or food. These are things that they may ultimately have to take on debt to afford. \u201cProgressive candidates need to be talking about debt-free college instead of just free college, and going beyond tuition for low-income students,\u201d Tiffany Jones, the director of higher-education policy at the Education Trust, an advocacy group for low-income students, told me.\n\nHarris\u2019s declaration was a departure from her language in 2016, when she first introduced a plan, toward the end of her Senate campaign, to make community college tuition-free for all, and four-year college tuition-free for families making less than $140,000 a year; it was even a departure from weeks prior, when she pushed for tuition-free college. Her development signaled, perhaps above all, how the Democratic Party has evolved on college affordability.\n\nRead: Why is college in America so expensive?\n\nThe United States has a long history of college-access and -affordability policies\u2014the first Morrill Act, the GI Bill, etc.\u2014that did not provide equitable access or universal affordability, particularly for minorities. Advocates hope that a similar mistake won\u2019t be made with a potential national free-college policy, and that debt-free college becomes the new gold standard.", "description": "Well, sort of", "authors": ["Adam Harris"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/Free_College_2020_FINAL_1/facebook.jpg?1551132324", "published_at": "2019-02-20"}
