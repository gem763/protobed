To do so, you'll first need to find some jobs to apply for so we've rounded a good set of sites to start your search.\n\nThis Is What A Perfect Resume Looks Like Recruiters spend an average of six seconds reviewing a resume before they make the initial decision on candidates. That means you have to win them over fast. To get a better idea of what makes a resume great, we reached out to Amanda Augustine, career expert at online job-matching service TheLadders. She created an example of an excellent resume and allowed us to share it.

On the front page, chuck in a few keywords such as 'casual', 'retail' or whatever you're thinking of, choose a relevant industry, where you're located and hit that 'Search' button. Once the results come up, you can refine them further by selecting whether you're looking for casual or full-time work, what sort of position you're interested in within the field and salary expectations. There's also a handy button to filter out any unpaid jobs and internships if you're looking for that sweet cash injection.\n\nSeek is one of the biggest job sites in Australia but that means you'll need to do a bit of work filtering out all the irrelevant stuff. Similarly, on the front page you'll need to search for some keywords (or leave it blank), select the industry and your preferred location. But if you hit that 'More options' button before you search, you can limit the thousands of jobs you're likely to bring up on first search. From there, you can set your salary expectations, the type of work you want (casual or part-time) and limit it to jobs posted within a certain timeframe.\n\nIndeed offers a more simplified search option with key words and location. Once you've searched that, you can then refine it salary expectation, job location range, job type and role titles.\n\nWhile LinkedIn seems to have become a Tumblr for work these days, its Jobs section is incredibly handy. You'll first need to make a profile (here's some tips on that), then head to the Jobs tab and select relevant filters and browse to your heart's content.\n\nIf there's nothing immediately available, you can set alerts for those searches so you'll know when something new pops up.\n\nThe government also operates its own job search site, JobSearch, for jobs in the public service if you'd like some stable work and great pay (especially for entry-level work). Like most other job sites, pop in some keywords, preferred job location and field and search away until you find that perfect job.\n\nIf you're finding too many are popping up at once, you can go to town on customising it to find your dream interim job.\n\nFinally, there's Glassdoor, which provides some employer reviews and estimated salaries about some of the major employers too. To use Glassdoor, you'll need to sign up for an account and then you'll be able to search via keywords and location. You'll also be able to search for companies to see whether anyone's left reviews about what it's like to work there.\n\nAlternatively, some places still do job offerings the old school way with a piece of paper out the front of the store. If this is your preferred vibe, talking to a real person about why you deserve the job, visit your local town centre and keep an eye out for smaller businesses who are on the lookout.", "description": "With final school exams rolling up and the holidays just around the corner, now's a good time to think about nabbing a job over the summer break before you head to university, TAFE, travel or full-time work.
