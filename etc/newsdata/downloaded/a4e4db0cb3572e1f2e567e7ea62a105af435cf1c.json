He appeared for the last time in the first of Emmerdale\u2019s double tonight but a scene later saw Billy Fletcher (Jay Kontzle) explain to Kim Tate (Claire King) and Al Champan (Michael Wildman) that Ellis had accepted a new job in Dubai and was moving abroad with his mum Jessie Grant (Sandra Marvin).\n\nIn the wake of the incident at the TV Choice Awards, Asan said: \u2018My behaviour at the TV Choice Awards was completely unacceptable and very much out of character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I sincerely apologise to everybody who has been affected especially Jamie Lomas, the whole Emmerdale team, our audience, ITV, my family, and the organisers of the TV Choice Awards. I am devastated, +accept full responsibility for my actions and I am determined to learn from this.\u2019\n\nAfter the dust had settled, the actor recently tweeted: \u2018All the people who\u2019ve reached out and had my back you\u2019ll never know how much I appreciate you. I\u2019ve learned, I\u2019ve grown and now I\u2019m working harder than ever to finish what I started. Keep you\u2019re circle tight and always fall forward!\n\n\u2018The universe tends to unfold as it should. (sic)\u2019\n\nEllis wasn\u2019t the only departure from this week\u2019s Emmerdale storylines as Robert Sugden\u2019s (Ryan Hawley) final storyline was playing out, with the police surrounding him and Aaron Dingle (Danny Miller).\n\nOther actors who have recently left include Sally Dexter (Faith), Anthony Quinlan (Pete), Michael Praed (Frank) and Gaynor Faye (Megan).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "He threatened to stab Jamie Lomas.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PRI_84262462-e1568370908706_1571339981.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
