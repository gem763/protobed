Andrew Cuomo Drops N-Word in Radio Interview", "language": "en", "text": "Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) on Tuesday used the N-word during a radio interview in which he quoted a New York Times op-ed on discrimination against Italian-Americans.\n\n\u201cThe Times also said in an article the other day, apropos of nothing, they were talking about it,\u201d Cuomo told WAMC in reference to the newspaper\u2019s op-ed titled \u201cHow Italians Became White.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing back to the Italian Americans because now you have me. They used an expression that southern Italians were called quote-unquote, and pardon my language, but I\u2019m just quoting The Times, n**ger wops. N-word wops as a derogatory comment,\u201d added the Democrat governor.\n\nOn Monday, Cuomo announced his \u201cfull support\u201d for a statue of Saint Frances Cabrini, who founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, an institute that famously supported Italian immigrants to the U.S.\n\n\u201cAs Italian Americans, we must also remember that we ourselves are not immune from attack. The ugliness of Italian American stereotyping is still alive and well. Our battle is not over,\u201d Cuomo said Saturday at the Columbus Citizens Foundation Gala.\n\nHe also expressed support for the Brooklyn Diocese\u2019s plans to erect its own memorial of Cabrini.\n\n\u201cThey are right. We should applaud their courage and their activism,\u201d he stated.\n\nCuomo\u2019s younger brother, CNN host Christopher Cuomo, was recently the subject of much mockery for claiming that him being called \u201cFredo\u201d \u2014 a character from the \u201cGodfather\u201d film series \u2014 is like \u201cthe N-word to Italians.\u201d", "description": "Andrew Cuomo used the N-word during a radio interview in which he quoted a New York Times op-ed on discrimination\u00a0against Italian-Americans.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1026547638-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
