They apparently expected Lindsey Graham to use his perch as Senate Judiciary chair to push back against the House effort, but up to now Graham has kept his committee out of the process. Graham has now called a presser for later today, and Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan wonders whether Graham has had enough of the House, or the White House has had enough of Graham\u2019s silence:\n\nThis @LindseyGrahamSC press conference comes as influential figures in the Trump base, including @DonaldJTrumpJr, pile pressure on Graham for what they say is his lack of push back, as Senate Judiciary chair, against House Dem impeachment drive. https://t.co/xBAsNzN4v4 \u2014 Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) October 24, 2019\n\nThis reached a crescendo pitch earlier this week when Trump complained on Twitter about a lack of \u201cfight\u201d from Senate Republicans. After yesterday\u2019s clown show in the SCIF, however, Graham has decided to take more concrete action. He told Sean Hannity last night that he and Mitch McConnell plan to introduce a resolution in the Senate condemning the House\u2019s handling of impeachment:\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is planning to introduce a resolution condemning the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry process and argued that any articles should be dismissed in the Senate without a trial. \u201cThis resolution puts the Senate on record condemning the House. \u2026 Here\u2019s the point of the resolution: Any impeachment vote based on this process, to me, is illegitimate, is unconstitutional, and should be dismissed in the Senate without a trial,\u201d Graham told Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity. \u2026 Graham added on Tuesday night that Trump should get \u201cthe same rights that any American has if you\u2019re giving a parking ticket to confront the witnesses against you: can\u2019t be based on hearsay.\u201d \u201cWe cannot allow future presidents and this president to be impeached based on an inquiry in the House that\u2019s never been voted upon, that does not allow the president to confront the witnesses against him, to call witnesses on his behalf, and cross-examine people who are accusing him of misdeeds,\u201d he added.\n\nThe resolution will not mean much, of course, but at least it will give Senate Republicans a chance to signal to their Democrat colleagues just how much credibility they see in the House process. Graham also told Hannity that the Senate GOP has discussed simply dismissing any articles of impeachment that arise from this process, which The Hill reports this morning as well:\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s biggest allies in the Senate are looking to quickly quash articles of impeachment that the Democratic-controlled House might pass in the coming months. The possible GOP strategy would swiftly dismiss impeachment following an extensive House inquiry that is investigating whether Trump tried to leverage aid to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. \u2026 Republicans, who believe it is likely the House will impeach Trump, are weighing what is best for their party: a rapid dismissal of impeachment or a vote to acquit Trump after a trial. Sixty-seven votes are needed to convict a president.\n\nThat, and the SCIF clown show that took place yesterday, has some House Democrats worried enough to start thinking about moving into an open inquiry sooner than planned. The Washington Post reports that a flat-out Senate rejection would look bad under any circumstances, but especially after House Republicans have signaled that they will play hardball against the leaks coming from Schiff\u2019s team:\n\nHouse Democrats are preparing to move their largely private impeachment inquiry onto a more public stage as soon as mid-November and are already grappling with how best to present the complex Ukraine saga to the American people. Over the past three weeks, a parade of current and former Trump administration officials have testified behind closed doors, providing House investigators with a compelling narrative of President Trump\u2019s campaign to extract political favors from Ukrainian officials. But on Wednesday, after conservative lawmakers stormed the hearing room and delayed the proceedings for five hours, some Democrats were feeling pressure to advance public hearings in hopes of avoiding further disruptions. \u2026 Some Democrats are concerned that repeated protests by Republicans, similar to Wednesday\u2019s disruption, could make it impossible for them to question witnesses and could completely stop the process.\n\nThe threat of dismissal is real, and has been at least hinted at by McConnell himself. It could take place in one of two forms \u2014 either an explicit motion to dismiss, or by a motion for an immediate verdict. If House Democrats don\u2019t bother to make a strong public case but instead largely rely on \u201csecret\u201d depositions for the article(s) of impeachment, then Senate Republicans would likely opt for the former to emphasize the illegitimacy of the House process. They would only need a simple majority to dismiss, and given the clown-show process that Schiff has been running (although within the rules), it would make it the easiest politically.\n\nIf House Democrats do hold public hearings and testimony, a dismissal might be tough, but it might also undermine their case. There have already been counter-leaks suggesting that the supposedly damning testimony is only hearsay and supposition for a premise that isn\u2019t even technically a crime at all. If this comes down to rumors and analysis rather than fact witnesses, the entire enterprise will bomb harder than the Muellermas in late July. In that case, Senate Republicans might well opt for the immediate verdict, or even a short trial to rebut the public case made in the House and to humiliate Schiff and Nancy Pelosi over it.\n\nGraham\u2019s presser will take place at 3 pm ET today, presumably to announce the substance of the resolution. Will Graham start opening his own probe into the machinations that produced the House clown show? That\u2019s what the White House really wants, but Graham will be very reluctant to start that kind of interchamber food fight by having a Senate committee essentially investigating the House.\n\nUpdate: Via Allahpundit, Graham\u2019s already precluding that possibility on those very grounds:\n\nGraham said Intel committee has oversight of Ukraine/whistleblower stuff. He said he will eventually hold hearings on IG report on origin of Russia probe. \"My committee is going to focus on the Horowitz report. We\u2019ll build out upon that.\u201d\n\n2/2 \u2014 Paul Kane (@pkcapitol) October 24, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s a smart move, although it won\u2019t make the White House too happy.", "description": "\"... and should be dismissed in the Senate without a trial.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graham-impeachment.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
