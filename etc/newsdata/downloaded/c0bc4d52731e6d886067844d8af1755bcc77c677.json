And we miss it, quite frankly.\n\nSo we\u2019re glad we got the chance to catch up with Molly-Mae Hague recently. The 20-year-old played Text On The Beach with Cosmopolitan UK, and we learned all sorts of interesting things about her fellow Islanders.\n\nTalking about who the hardest person to live with in the villa was, Molly-Mae said: \u201cI mean there isn\u2019t really anyone who stands out to me as being the hardest to live with. I think there were times when everyone got on each other\u2019s nerves. I know I got on people\u2019s nerves \u2013 I know I can be a little bit whingey and loud sometimes; I think everyone can. But I think, we all got on each other\u2019s nerves at certain points because we were in that house for eight weeks.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Ricky Vigil M - Getty Images More\n\nWhen she was asked what the hardest challenge had been for her in the villa, Molly-Mae said it was the ones to do with social media.\n\n\u201cI found it quite hard finding out what people were saying about you. When you have no idea what\u2019s going on in the outside world, and to hear what people are saying about you that aren\u2019t necessarily positive is a little bit hard.\"\n\nShe also opened up about the prospect of her and Tommy Fury's new house having a room dedicated to boxing memorabilia and Mayonnaise.
