Jefferson had been playing video games with her eight-year-old nephew.\n\nAt a press conference, Ed Kraus grew emotional when describing the morale of the police department.\n\n\u201cOfficers are hurting,\u201d he said. Kraus said he had not encountered an officer who disagreed with the decision to arrest Aaron Dean, and pleaded with Fort Worth residents to not let the conduct of one officer reflect on the whole department.\n\nAt least five people have been shot dead by Fort Worth police officers this year.\n\nKraus said Dean did not make a statement to investigators before resigning on Monday. Kraus said he would have been fired if he had not quit voluntarily.\n\nDean was arrested on Monday night on a murder charge in the shooting death of Atatiana Jefferson. He is out of custody after posting bond, which was set at $200,000.\n\nJefferson was devoted to her family and had moved into her mother\u2019s Fort Worth home earlier this year to help as her mom\u2019s health declined, relatives said. With her mother in the hospital, Jefferson and her eight-year-old nephew were the only two people home when she was shot.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who family members sometimes called \u201cTay\u201d, had the front door of the home open to let the cool breeze in, said Lee Merritt, an attorney for the family.\n\n\u201cThey did that all night from sunset until the time that they lost track of time \u2026 when they heard someone prowling around in the bushes,\u201d Merritt said during a news conference with the family on Monday.\n\n\u201cHe and his Auntie Tay experienced the fear of someone prowling in the backyard,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cHis Auntie Tay did not allow him to check the window, she checked herself.\u201d\n\nOfficer Dean fired a split second after shouting at Jefferson to show her hands. Police bodycam video shows the officer did not identify himself as police.\n\nAmber Carr said her sister loved spending time with her nephews.\n\n\u201cMy sister, the relationship she has with my sons is indescribable. Sometimes people think that they are her kids and not mine,\u201d said Carr, who also has a four-year-old son.\n\nShe said the last time she spoke to her sister was a week before she was killed.\n\n\u201cShe came to the hospital in Plano where I was recovering from a major heart surgery. She came and brought me food, she brought me a new cellphone,\u201d Carr said.\n\nJefferson loved playing basketball and video games with the eight-year-old and also \u201chelped him become more independent and self-sufficient\u201d, Carr said.\n\nWhen Carr picked the eight-year-old up at a facility where police took him after Jefferson was killed, it was the boy who told his mother about the shooting.", "description": "Fort%20Worth%20police%20chief%3A%20%27absolutely%20no%20excuse%27%20for%20officer%20killing%20black%20woman%20%7C%20Texas%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
