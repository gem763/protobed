(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nFor the 40,000-plus Washingtonians who will pack into Nationals Park on Friday night for the first World Series game in the District since 1933, there are no weather worries. But the Saturday night game now looks as if it could be a bit damp, and showers could continue into Sunday morning, coinciding with the Marine Corps Marathon.\n\nIf a third game at Nationals Park is necessary on Sunday night, it now looks as though most of the rain should be over by then (although a few could linger early on). This is a change from our earlier forecast, which called for likely showers.\n\nForecasts in brief\n\nGame 2 watch party at Nationals Park, Wednesday, 8:07 p.m.: First-pitch temperature: 56 to 58 degrees. Clear skies. Temperatures falling into the low 50s. No chance of rain.\n\nGame 3 at Nationals Park, Friday, 8:07 p.m.: First-pitch temperature: Near 60 degrees. Partly cloudy skies with temperatures falling into mid-50s. Chance of rain: 10 percent\n\nGame 4 at Nationals Park, Saturday, 8:07 p.m.: First-pitch temperature: 56 to 58 degrees. Cloudy with showers possible. Temperatures steady in the 50s. Chance of rain: 40 percent. Chance of rain delay: 20 percent. Chance of postponement: 10 percent.\n\nMarine Corps Marathon, Sunday, 7:55 a.m.: Temperatures in mid-50s to start race. Cloudy with intermittent showers and temperature rising into the 60s by mid-to-late morning. Chance of rain: 60 percent.\n\nGame 5 at Nationals Park, Sunday, 8:07 p.m. (if necessary): First-pitch temperature: Near 65 degrees. Chance of a lingering shower with temperatures falling to near 60. Chance of rain: 20 percent. Chance of rain delay: 10 percent. Chance of postponement: 5 percent.\n\nForecast discussion\n\nA storm system will organize in the South on Saturday, lifting north toward the eastern Great Lakes that night. As it moves north, it will push a warm front through the Washington region, most likely Saturday evening, introducing a chance of showers. The exact timing for the onset of any showers is still uncertain and they may be most numerous in our western areas, but some could still affect Game 4 of the World Series.\n\nOn-and-off showers will remain possible Saturday night through Sunday afternoon, affecting the Marine Corps Marathon, but we do not expect a washout. Temperatures will turn rather mild, rising into the 60s on Sunday, thanks to winds from the south in the warm front\u2019s wake.\n\n\n\nForecast radar from Canadian model Saturday afternoon through Sunday night.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, a cold front will sweep across the region, likely producing a closing round of showers. Once that front exits, rain chances should diminish Sunday evening. The exact timing of the cold front\u2019s departure is still to be determined. If it\u2019s on the slow side, some showers could linger into a possible Game 5 of the World Series.", "description": "The forecast for Saturday night into Sunday has turned a bit wet.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "October At Pm", "Jason Samenow Is The Washington Post S Weather Editor", "Capital Weather Gang'S Chief Meteorologist.
