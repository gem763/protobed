This is the fundamental reason why a Final Say or People\u2019s Vote is essential. To call it \u201ca betrayal of democracy\u201d is beyond absurd; it is a betrayal of democracy NOT to do it.\n\nBill Stevenson\n\nSuffolk\n\nReality bites\n\nThank you, Dame Sally Davies.

During our next train trip home from a long day out, I shall try to remember that when my seven year old asks for his neatly cut carrot and celery strips to dip into his smokey hummus pot, to sternly ask him to refrain until we get home.

Is it not about time that the antics of these women, whose main claim to fame lies in the fact that one is married to the spud-faced nipper and the other one to another footballer, were left to the anonymity they so clearly deserve?\n\nRobin J Bulow\n\nClacton-on-Sea", "description": "Of course the Kurds couldn\u2019t expect their American \u201callies\u201d to protect them from a Turkish attack.
