The video in question was posted to the channel in July 2018.\n\nAccording to the Times, the video was shown last week at the American Priority conference at Doral Miami resort. Speakers at the event included Donald Trump Jr and former White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nOne of the event organisers, Alex Phillips told the Times that he denounced the video and was looking into how it was played at the event.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, CNN said the video was \u201cvile and horrific\u201d.\n\n\u201cSadly, this is not the first time that supporters of the president have promoted violence against the media in a video they apparently find entertaining \u2013 but it is by far and away the worst,\u201d CNN said in a tweeted statement.\n\n\u201cThe president and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone.\u201d\n\nThe White House Correspondents Association said it was \u201chorrified\u201d by the video and \u201call Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed towards journalists and his political opponents\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have previously told the president his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.\u201d\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke condemned the video on Twitter, saying: \u201cThis video isn\u2019t funny. It will get people killed.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Trump told the Times that the video had nothing to do with Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the campaign does not condone violence.", "description": "Doctored scene from a violent film shows the US president attacking CNN, Politico, Hillary Clinton and John McCain", "authors": ["Josh Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/652490c0f9d9b1702ab5cbc726b1a3ea18572563/119_158_1139_684/master/1139.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4617271412a9198dc9fc9f25fa6627ed", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
