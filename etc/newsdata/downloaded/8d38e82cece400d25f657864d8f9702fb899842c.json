The VIX \u2013 otherwise known as the \"fear gauge\" \u2013 climbed nearly 11 per cent on Wednesday, posting a second day of double-digit gains for the first time since July 31-August 1.\n\nGiven the S &P 500 Index had been trading at a hefty 17 times forecast earnings (compared to a 10-year average of 15 times), the market was primed for a fall if the newsflow turned bad.\n\nSigns of economic weakness come as investors brace for the third quarter earnings season, which will be another test of market sentiment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Factset, US earnings per share are forecast to fall a little more than 3 per cent, which if true would mark the first three consecutive quarters of negative year-on-year declines since the fourth quarter of 2015 through the second quarter of 2016.\n\nAustralian stocks are also vulnerable. Trading at 17 times forward earnings, on Macquarie's numbers, there has been more negative consensus earnings revisions than positive revisions.\n\nWith banks' margins and dividend growth under pressure from ongoing cuts to official interest rates, and commodities prices down from their highs earlier this year, it wouldn't be surprising to see more negative earnings revisions come through.\n\nInvestors have rationalised the rally in global stocks on the basis that falling bond yields help support valuations. That may be true, but it's a risky game to play at possibly the end of the cycle.\n\nInvestors have bet that lower bond yields are not an omen of a recession which ends up depressing earnings, while at the same time hoping that growth remains muted enough to ensure bond yields don't rise and end up sapping the rally of its strength.\n\nThe risk is that the recent inversion of the US yield curve may prove right in portending the threat of a recession \u2013 unless action is taken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, all eyes are now on the Federal Reserve to ride to the rescue with more monetary stimulus.\n\nThe US central bank has clearly lagged its peers in easing policy, and traders are increasingly convinced another rate cut is set to follow the two cuts of 25 basis points delivered over the past two meetings.\n\nFutures markets have priced in a 70 per cent chance of a cut later this month, up from 40 per cent before the ISM data.\n\nWhile another Fed rate cut will bolster market sentiment, a bigger boost to growth would come from an end to the pall of uncertainty cast by Trump's trade war.\n\nTrump's shirt-fronting of China on trade risks turning the Fed's \"mid-cycle adjustment\" of rates into a more prolonged campaign.", "description": "Having taken aim at the Fed and rivals, slumping global manufacturing activity and financial markets have sharpened focus on the real threat to growth: Trump himself.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/295cb87b5e79128efdabf870bdd5b646603cbd48", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
