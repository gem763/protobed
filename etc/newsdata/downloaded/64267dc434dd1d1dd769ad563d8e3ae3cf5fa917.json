That wasn't going to work,\" said Riley, who called her the best Brazilian player he's watched. \"She took ownership, she took accountability.\n\n\"I think you could see today how many times she came back behind a ball and defended for us and closed people down. She's a complete player.\"\n\nDebinha fired the opening salvo against the Chicago Red Stars, scoring the first goal of what would ultimately become a shutout four-goal win for the Courage.\n\nShe was controversially left off the NWSL's Best XI lists for the season, making the honor on Sunday, announced in front of a sold-out hometown crowd, all the more sweet.\n\n\"I just want to help my team, I just want to improve every training, every game,\" a pleased Debinha told reporters after the match. \"I don't know what to say -- I just want to enjoy playing and do my best.\"", "description": "NWSL championship MVP Debinha the 'complete player': coach", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9R00O_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
