As one of the most senior members of the Senate, Biden twice intervened with federal agencies in ways that benefited his son Hunter\u2019s clients, the Washington Examiner\u2019s Alana Goodman reports. Both interventions took place when Biden was running for president in 2007, and involve curiously arcane topics to everyone except Hunter\u2019s clients:\n\nOn Feb. 28, 2007, Biden contacted DHS to express that he was \u201cconcerned about the Department\u2019s proposed chemical security regulations authorized by Section 550 of DHS Appropriations Act of 2007,\u201d according to the department\u2019s log of its contacts with members of Congress. Section 550, which was passed in 2006 as part of the DHS appropriations bill, requires high-risk chemical plants to submit site safety plans to DHS for approval, including security credentialing and training for employees. Eight weeks earlier, the Industrial Safety Training Council had hired Hunter Biden\u2019s firm to lobby DHS on the issue. The trade group, which represents companies that provide safety training for chemical facility employees, was mounting a heavy lobbying campaign over section 550, submitting congressional testimony about the need to expand background checks for chemical plant employees.\n\nJust to remind everyone of the timing, Biden had announced his presidential bid on January 7, 2007, and he didn\u2019t officially suspend it until almost precisely a year later on January 3, 2008. The official launch date of the Biden campaign was January 31, 2007, four weeks prior to Biden\u2019s intervention at DHS. Having someone who was not just a senior senator but also a serious (at the time) contender for the presidential nomination taking an interest in security regs must have raised a few eyebrows at DHS.\n\nAnd Biden\u2019s interest in this arcane issue is curious, too. Biden sat on the Judiciary Committee in 2007 (having formerly chaired it) and chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. As far as can be seen on either Wikipedia or his campaign\u2019s website, Biden never sat on the Homeland Security Committee, at that time or any other. Why would Biden take such an interest in an arcane DHS regulation at all, let alone the one that his son\u2019s law firm client wanted to challenge?\n\nThe other intervention noted by Goodman was at least within the purview of one of Biden\u2019s committee assignments. On the same day that Biden officially launched his presidential campaign, he took the time to check in with the Attorney General to request a meeting about boosting funding for a fingerprint system involved in federal background checks:\n\n\u201cI write to request your assistance in implementing an expanded background check system for our nation\u2019s volunteer organizations,\u201d wrote Biden. \u201cIf we can work together to expand the number of volunteer organizations that have access to fast, accurate, and inexpensive fingerprint background checks, we will make significant and important strides in our ongoing effort to protect kids across our country.\u201d Biden added, \u201cI would like to convene a small meeting with key representatives\u201d from DOJ, the FBI, members of Congress and volunteer groups. One of Hunter\u2019s firm\u2019s lobbying clients at the time, a coalition of state-level criminal justice advocates called SEARCH, was also lobbying the federal government for a broader fingerprint screening system at the time.\n\nIn this case, however, Biden\u2019s intervention went beyond a phone call. Early the next year, after Biden dropped out of the presidential primary campaign, he returned to the Senate and Judiciary to author the Child Protection Improvements Act. Guess what the bill contained, and guess who lobbied for its passage?\n\nBiden introduced a bill called the \u201cChild Protection Improvements Act\u201d on March 13, 2008, which created a national fingerprint background check system for volunteer groups that worked with children. Oldaker, Biden & Belair promptly began lobbying for the bill on behalf of their client, SEARCH, according to lobbying records. SEARCH paid the firm $93,000 in 2008, records show.\n\nIt turned out that Biden\u2019s seat on Judiciary came in handy for Hunter and his client.\n\nLater that year when Barack Obama selected Joe Biden as his running mate, Hunter left the firm. That was due to concerns about Hunter\u2019s connections to Biden\u2019s actions in the Senate, as well as Biden\u2019s attempts to leverage his influence to find his son a different job, according to a 2007 lawsuit brought by one of Biden\u2019s business associates:\n\nBefore Joe Biden launched his second campaign for president in November 2006, he sought to find Hunter Biden a new line of work as he became \u201cconcerned with the impact that Hunter\u2019s lobbying activities might have on his expected campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination,\u201d according to court documents filed by Hunter Biden\u2019s former business associate Anthony Lotito in New York in 2007 as part of a dispute between the two men. According to claims Lotito made as part of a lawsuit targeting the Bidens, Joe Biden tasked his brother, James, with finding his son a new job, and James Biden reached out to Lotito for help. \u201c[James] Biden told Lotito that, in light of these concerns, his brother had asked him to seek Lotito\u2019s assistance in finding employment for Hunter in a non-lobbying capacity,\u201d the court documents read. \u201cLotito agreed to help, and, in connection therewith, began to consider whether any of his contacts in the financial community might be a good starting place in which to seek out employment on Hunter\u2019s behalf.\u201d Shortly after Lotito connected with Hunter and James Biden, the trio worked with Lotito to acquire a hedge fund called Paradigm. But within months, the deal began to unravel. Lotito filed the lawsuit in New York accusing the Bidens of cutting him out of the Paradigm deal, and the Bidens countered that Lotito had misrepresented the value of the hedge fund they had acquired. The Bidens eventually settled with Lotito in 2008 after incurring \u201c$1.3 million in out-of-pocket losses,\u201d according to court records filed by the Bidens in the case. Hunter Biden later called the ordeal \u201ca tragicomedy,\u201d according to The New Yorker.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the track record of the appearance of nepotism and familial enrichment. That brings us to this morning, when Joe Biden tried to make an \u201cat least we\u2019re not the Trumps!\u201d argument on CBS:\n\n\u201cDo you believe President Trump\u2019s children have acted properly and avoided conflicts of interest?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked. \u201cLook, I wasn\u2019t raised to go after the children. Their actions speak for themselves. I can just tell you this, that if I\u2019m president, get elected president, my children are not gonna have offices in the White House. My children are not gonna sit in on cabinet meetings,\u201d Biden said.\n\nHunter hasn\u2019t really needed a desk in Joe\u2019s office, has he?", "description": "\"My children are not gonna have offices in the White House.\" Would they need any?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/biden-60mins.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
