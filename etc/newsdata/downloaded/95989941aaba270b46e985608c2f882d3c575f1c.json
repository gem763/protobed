REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Overlapping British and European Union share trading rules would damage markets \u201cto no good end\u201d and can be avoided, Britain\u2019s top markets watchdog said on Monday.\n\nBritain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, but has yet to agree a divorce settlement with the bloc.\n\nBrussels has said that if there is a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit, investment firms in the bloc must trade euro-denominated shares in the EU; many are currently heavily traded in London.\n\nFinancial Conduct Authority CEO Andrew Bailey said some of this overlap must be avoided. \u201cIt is therefore easy to conclude that for those shares, market liquidity would be damaged to no good end,\u201d Bailey said in a speech at Bloomberg.\n\nHe reiterated comments from the Bank of England that extensive preparations for a no-deal Brexit would not mean that all disruption in markets can be avoided.\n\nBrussels has said that EU customers could continue using clearing houses for derivatives in London until March next year if there is a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThis date was reflected Britain\u2019s original plan to leave the EU last March. Bailey said Brussels would need to grant an extension soon if there is a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThere is no reason to \u201csacrifice open financial markets\u201d and many reasons to preserve them, Bailey said.", "description": "Overlapping British and European Union share trading rules would damage markets \"to no good end\" and can be avoided, Britain's top markets watchdog said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430381988&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0G6", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
