The inquiry could result in Trump\u2019s removal from office \u2013 or it could stop well short of that. Here\u2019s how it could play out.\n\nThe impeachment process has two main parts: the passage of articles of impeachment by the House of Representatives followed by a trial in the Senate, with the chief justice of the US supreme court presiding.\n\nIf a two-thirds Senate majority votes to convict, the president is removed from office.\n\nBut no previous impeachment inquiry has resulted in a Senate conviction. Both Bill Clinton (1998) and Andrew Johnson (1868) were acquitted in the Senate. Richard Nixon (1974) resigned before the House voted on impeachment.", "description": "The impeachment process has two main parts \u2013 here\u2019s a visual guide to how it could play out", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy", "Juweek Adolphe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea1a03df6e58f556c494add99438e0cfef2755cf/0_84_5472_3283/master/5472.png?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=739e202e1585621fb1ac2b0443e30f47", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
