(SANA via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Targeting Turkey's economy, President Donald Trump announced sanctions aimed at restraining the Turks' assault against Kurdish fighters and civilians in Syria \u2014 an assault Turkey began after Trump announced he was moving U.S. troops out of the way.\n\nThe United States on Monday also called on Turkey to stop the invasion and declare a cease-fire, and Trump is sending Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser Robert O'Brien to Ankara as soon as possible in an attempt to begin negotiations. Pence said Trump spoke directly to Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who promised not to attack the border town of Kobani, which in 2015 witnessed the Islamic State group's first defeat in a battle by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters.\n\n\"President Trump communicated to him very clearly that the United States of America wants Turkey to stop the invasion, implement an immediate cease-fire and to begin to negotiate with Kurdish forces in Syria to bring an end to the violence,\" Pence said.\n\nThe Americans were scrambling for Syria's exits, a move criticized at home and abroad as opening the door to a resurgence of the Islamic State group, whose violent takeover of Syrian and Iraqi lands five years ago was the reason American forces went in the first place.\n\nTrump said the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops who had been partnering with local Kurdish fighters to battle the Islamic State in northern Syria are leaving the country. They will remain in the Middle East, he said, to \"monitor the situation\" and to prevent a revival of IS \u2014 a goal that even Trump's allies say has become much more difficult as a result of the U.S. pullout.\n\nThe Turks began attacks in Syria last week against the Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom the Turks see as terrorists. On Monday, Syrian government troops moved north toward the border region, setting up a potential clash with Turkish-led forces.\n\nTrump said Turkey's invasion is \"precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes,\" a reference to reports of Turkish-backed fighters executing Kurdish fighters on the battlefield.\n\nThe Kurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. said they had reached a deal with President Bashar Assad's government to help them fend off Turkey's invasion, a move that brings Russian forces deeper into the conflict.\n\nIn his sanctions announcement, Trump said he was halting negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey and raising steel tariffs back up to 50%. Trump also imposed sanctions on three senior Turkish officials and Turkey's defense and energy ministries.\n\n\"I am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey's economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,\" Trump said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions will hurt an already weak Turkish economy. Pence said the U.S. will continue to ramp up the sanctions \"unless Turkey is willing to embrace a cease-fire, come to the negotiating table and end the violence.\"\n\nAmerican troops consolidated their positions in northern Syria on Monday and prepared to evacuate equipment in advance of a full withdrawal, a U.S. defense official said.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name, said U.S. officials were weighing options for a potential future counter-IS campaign, including the possibility of waging it with a combination of air power and special operations forces based outside Syria, perhaps in Iraq.\n\nThe hurried preparations for a U.S. exit were triggered by Trump's decision Saturday to expand a limited troop pullout into a complete withdrawal.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday he would travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels next week to urge European allies to impose \"diplomatic and economic measures\" against Turkey \u2014 a fellow NATO ally \u2014 for what Esper called Ankara's \"egregious\" actions.\n\nEsper said Turkey's incursion had created unacceptable risk to U.S. forces in northern Syria and \"we also are at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict.\"\n\nThe only exception to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria is a group of perhaps 200 troops who will remain at a base called Tanf in southern Syria near the Jordanian border along the strategically important Baghdad-to-Damascus highway. Those troops work with Syrian opposition forces unrelated to the Kurdish-led fighters in northern Syria.", "description": "Targeting Turkey's economy, President Donald Trump announced sanctions aimed at restraining the Turks' assault against Kurdish fighters and civilians in Syria \u2014 an assault Turkey began after Trump announced he was moving U.S. troops out of the way.
