The U.S. Commerce Department has received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell U.S. goods to Huawei, Reuters reported in August.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration gave the green light last week to start approving licenses for a few American companies, to bypass the curbs it put on the Chinese equipment maker this year, the paper said https://nyti.ms/35pED2e.\n\nHuawei and the U.S. Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nThe move comes as the two countries are set to meet later this week in Washington for talks to end their 15-month trade war, and tensions mounted after U.S. administration expanded its blacklist on Monday by adding 28 Chinese entities including top artificial intelligence startups.
