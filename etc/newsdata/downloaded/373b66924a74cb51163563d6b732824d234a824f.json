Ryan Biddulph often promotes other bloggers, or talks about other people\u2019s blogs on his own blog Blogging from Paradise. More often than not, he\u2019s chatting up a blogging tip, or identifying a promotional concept that works well in the industry.\n\nMost bloggers are working toward making a profit from sharing information. Even here at TownHall, the interactive sharing of content, information, and ideas brings in ideas by promoting ad links where readers can purchase what interests them. Since I\u2019m moving into a new house and have ordered several pieces of new furniture (dressers, night stands, etc.) the majority of ads are directed at these pieces. And when I see something I\u2019m interested in, I click. If I purchase from that click, TownHall makes money on my \u201cCLICK.\u201d But did they really have anything to do with my purchase?\n\nNot really. But I did see the item, or a like item on their site, while reading content I wanted to read. So the option to place ads on your blog or website, offers a viable alternative income stream for content providers. This benefits not only the blogger, but also the marketing business.\n\nWhen you have a blog and you\u2019d like people to click your ad links, the best way to get them to click is to promote others first.\n\nYou really don\u2019t need to talk about yourself. You can talk about ads, other bloggers or writers, other businesses, or even the promoters on your site \u2013 if you don\u2019t directly TELL your readers to click those links!\n\nCreating evergreen content, driving traffic through links, and promoting others through links to their blogs can be lucrative, if only in link clicks, without becoming a clickbait site.\n\nNobody appreciates the sites where popups, ads, and overzealous promotion is all they see. And it\u2019s even worse if you have to click to the next page, because so much of the page is covered with ads that the actual content is split between many pages of ads. Ridiculous!\n\nThere\u2019s a better way.\n\nThere\u2019s a more proactive way to promote your content and income streams.\n\nPromote others first!\n\nIt\u2019s easy\u2026 Do you like the content? Leave a comment. Share the link.\n\nDo you like the book? Leave a review. Write a review and post it on your website, or a website where you offer reviews and content.\n\nWrite reviews when you purchase books on Amazon.com. ALWAYS.\n\nWrite reviews of other people\u2019s blogs and books on your own website.\n\nTalk about the incredible inspiration you get from another blogger.\n\nChat with and encourage those whose work you appreciate.\n\nOffer praise. Share their work. Add a comment on social media.\n\nWrite guest posts for them. Promote a variety of bloggers, or businesses, in your posts. Links are good!\n\nMention others in similar industries when you write blog posts, or books, or other items that offer opportunities.\n\nWhen you mention others, you give your readers time and opportunity to research them, visit their links, and read their work as well. Promote others, because as you do so, you\u2019re promoting yourself.\n\nSome fun ways to promote others\n\nWrite a Case Study about your experience using Financial Peace University with Dave Ramsey.\n\nDiscuss how you made a few extra dollars last year, investing with Crista Huff\u2019s advice.\n\nOr start your business based on advice from Kevin Cullis at HWJDB.com.\n\nThe opportunities you take to promote others will come back and bless you, because they will promote you. Others who see you promoting them, will promote you too. This process of promotion works all the time. Try it.\n\nLet\u2019s chat over coffee.", "description": "Recently, I was rewarded for my promotional efforts by a .09/25/2019 19:26:38PM EST.", "authors": ["Jan Verhoeff", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
