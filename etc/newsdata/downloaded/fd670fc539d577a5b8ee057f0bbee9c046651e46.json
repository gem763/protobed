CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett and New York Times national editor Marc Lacey will moderate, the news outlets announced. The format will be announced at a future date, the DNC said previously.\n\nTwelve candidates are currently qualified for the upcoming matchup, according to an ABC News analysis:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro\n\nHawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang\n\nCandidates have until Oct. 1 to qualify for the debate.\n\nAhead of next week's deadline, no other candidate appears to be closing in on the polling and donor requirements to qualify, based on ABC's analysis. Author Marianne Williamson met the donor threshold, according to her campaign, but she only has 2% support in one DNC-approved poll.\n\nThe debate will feature another matchup between the two polling front-runners, Biden and Warren, on the same stage. In recent national and early state polling, the Massachusetts senator continues to narrow the gap with the former vice president - with a September Des Moines Register/CNN poll showing a virtual tie between Warren and Biden in the Hawkeye state, with the Massachusetts senator holding onto a two-point lead over the former vice president.\n\nTo qualify for the October debate, candidates must receive 2% or more support in at least four national polls, or polls conducted in the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and/or Nevada and publicly released between June 28 and 11:59 p.m. Oct. 1.\n\nAny candidates\u2019 four qualifying polls must be sponsored by one or more of the following organizations approved by the DNC: The Associated Press, ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Des Moines Register, Fox News, Monmouth University, NBC News, New York Times, National Public Radio (NPR), Quinnipiac University, University of New Hampshire, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Washington Post, and Winthrop University. They also must be conducted by different organizations or -- if by the same organization -- must be in different geographical areas.\n\nCandidates must also have received donations from at least 130,000 unique donors over the course of the election cycle, with a minimum of 400 unique donors per state in at least 20 states.", "description": "The October debate, hosted by CNN and the New York Times, is set for a single night on Oct. 15, the Democratic National Committee told presidential campaigns Friday.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/biden-warren-debate-rt-ps-190927_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
