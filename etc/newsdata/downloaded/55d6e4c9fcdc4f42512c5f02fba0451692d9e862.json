That includes things like auto loans and credit cards; even a slightly lower rate for both can mean thousands of dollars in savings for consumers.\n\nFor consumers, that can be both good and bad news, according to Curt Long, the chief economist and vice president of research at the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt kind of depends on which side of the fence they\u2019re on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re potentially going to be a borrower in the near future, the fact that the Fed seems determined to be patient, in their words, is probably good news. It means rates will probably stay lower than they would have otherwise. On the other hand, if you\u2019re a saver, that might not be as good of news for you.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because some banks and credit unions will increase their savings rate during Fed hikes, making it a good chance for consumers \u2013 particularly retirees living off of their savings \u2013 to earn more.\n\nThe correlation isn\u2019t quite so direct, however: The Fed raises the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn passes that along to consumers. Congress tasked the central bank in 1977 with promoting \u201cmaximum employment, production and purchasing power\u201d by keeping the cost of goods stable and creating solid labor-market conditions.\n\nOne of the most potent tools in the Fed\u2019s arsenal is interest rates. But Kevin Philip, Bel Air Investment Advisor's managing director, noted that the cut is likely to be so modest that it won't have a large impact on consumers' financial lives -- though he said it's a good time to reduce debt.\n\n\"Interest rates at some point will go higher, and it\u2019s important to reduce in good times so as to not feel overburdened in leaner economic times,\" he said.\n\nTypically, when policymakers are trying to spur additional consumer spending, they lower interest rates to reduce the cost of borrowing (during the recession in 2008, for instance, the Fed lowered them to effectively zero and did not raise them again until 2015). Conversely, to avoid inflation and cool the economy, it will raise rates to make borrowing more expensive.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nGenerally, the Fed tries to maintain a federal funds rate between 2 percent and 5 percent; it last raised rates in December, but essentially reversed that decision in July, when it cut interest rates for the first time in a decade, thanks to growing economic uncertainties \u2013 like the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war, concerns of slowing growth and the increased likelihood of a no-deal Brexit.", "description": "What does it mean, exactly, for your own personal finances?", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/04/0/0/federal-reserve.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-02-21"}
