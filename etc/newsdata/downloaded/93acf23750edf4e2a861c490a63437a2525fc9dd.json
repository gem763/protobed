In a blender, cover the porcini with 600ml boiling water. Trim, wash and slice the leeks 2cm thick, then scrub the carrots, swede and celeriac and chop to roughly the same size.\n\nDrizzle two tablespoons of oil into a large casserole pan on a medium heat, strip in the rosemary, fry for one minute to crisp up, then transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add the cumin seeds and prepped veg to the flavoured oil, season with sea salt and black pepper, then cook for 30 minutes, stirring regularly.\n\nMeanwhile, peel and roughly chop the potatoes, cook in a pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until tender, then drain well. Mash with the butter and milk, and season to taste. Peel and quarter the onion, add to the porcini in the blender, along with the Marmite and tomato puree, and whizz until smooth. Pour into the veg pan and cook for 20 minutes, or until dark and caramelised, stirring regularly and scraping up any sticky bits from the bottom of the pan.\n\nTip the lentils (juices and all) into the veg pan, bring to a boil, then season to taste. Spoon over the mash, place on a tray, bake for 30 minutes, or until light golden and bubbling at the edges, then sprinkle over the crispy rosemary. Serve with simple steamed seasonal greens \u2013 it\u2019s a winner!\n\nCrispy cauliflower katsu\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Oliver\u2019s crispy cauliflower katsu. Photograph: David Loftus\n\nLight and delicate curry sauce, fluffy rice, lime-pickled chillies\n\nTip: for that 1980s retro feel, mould the rice in small bowls like I\u2019ve done here \u2013 it\u2019s pointless, but fun!\n\nPrep 30 min\n\nCook 1 hr 15 min\n\nServes 6\n\nEnergy 637kcal; fat 9.2g; sat fat 2g; protein 23.6g; carbs 120g; sugars 16g; salt 1.5g; fibre 10.4g\n\n2 heads cauliflower (800g each)\n\n3 fresh mixed-colour chillies\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n3 limes\n\n150g plain flour\n\n3 large free-range eggs\n\n200g fine breadcrumbs\n\n1 onion\n\n4 garlic cloves\n\n5cm piece ginger\n\n1 carrot\n\n1 bunch fresh coriander (30g), leaves and stalks separated\n\nOlive oil\n\n1 heaped tsp garam masala\n\n1 tsp ground turmeric\n\n3 tsp mango chutney\n\n450g basmati rice\n\nHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Cut six chunky cauliflower slices, straight through the stalks, around 2.5cm thick (use up the leftover stalks by making my simple pickle). Season the cauliflower slices all over with sea salt and leave aside (this will draw out the natural moisture). Meanwhile, finely slice the chillies and place them in a bowl with a pinch of salt. Finely grate over the zest of two limes, then squeeze over the juice and leave to lightly pickle.\n\nPut 100g of the flour into one bowl, beat the eggs in another, and tip the breadcrumbs into a third. Coat the cauliflower slices in the flour, dunk in the beaten egg, then dip, press and coat in the breadcrumbs. Place on an oiled baking tray and push down to compact. Bake for 45 minutes, or until golden and crisp.\n\nMeanwhile, peel the onion, garlic, ginger and carrot, then finely chop with the coriander stalks, reserving the leaves. Fry in a large pan on a medium heat with a tablespoon of oil and the spices for 15 minutes, stirring regularly. Stir in 50g of flour and the mango chutney, followed by a litre of boiling water. Whisk together, then simmer for 15 minutes, or to your preferred consistency, stirring occasionally. Taste and season to perfection with salt and black pepper. Cook the rice according to the packet instructions, then drain. Serve the rice and sauce with the crispy cauliflower, chilli pickle, lime wedges and reserved coriander leaves.\n\nMushroom stroganoff\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Oliver\u2019s mushroom stroganoff. Photograph: David Loftus\n\nCrunchy cornichons, fragrant capers, creamy whisky sauce, parsley\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 10 min\n\nServes 2\n\nEnergy 251 kcal; fat 13.9g; sat fat 5.2g; protein 6.7g; carbs 11.9g; sugars 7.9g; salt 0.8g; fibre 4.3g\n\n400g mixed mushrooms\n\n1 red onion\n\n2 garlic cloves\n\n4 silverskin pickled onions\n\n2 cornichons\n\n4 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley\n\nOlive oil\n\n1 tbsp baby capers\n\n50ml whisky\n\nSmoked paprika\n\n80g half-fat creme fraiche\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\nRice, to serve\n\nGet all the prep done before you start cooking: trim the mushrooms, tearing up any larger ones and leaving any smaller ones whole, peel and finely slice the red onion and garlic, and finely slice the pickled onions and cornichons. Pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, finely chopping the stalks.\n\nPlace a large nonstick frying pan over a high heat, throw in the mushrooms and red onions, shake into one layer, then dry-fry for five minutes (this will bring out the nutty flavour), stirring regularly. Drizzle in a tablespoon of oil, then add the garlic, pickled onions, cornichons, parsley stalks and capers. After three minutes, pour in the whisky, tilt the pan to carefully flame, or light with a long match (watch your eyebrows!), and, once the flames subside, add a quarter of a teaspoon of paprika, the creme fraiche and parsley leaves, then toss together.\n\nLoosen with a splash of boiling water to a saucy consistency, and season to taste with sea salt and black pepper. Divide between plates, sprinkle over a little paprika, and serve with fluffy rice.\n\nAngry pasta fagioli\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Oliver\u2019s pasta fagioli, arrabbiata-style. Photograph: David Loftus\n\nSquash, beans, warming chilli, rosemary oil\n\nI like to pull out the chillies, chop them into a paste and serve them as an angry (fiery) condiment for stirring back through the soup, to taste.\n\nPrep 20 min\n\nCook 40 min\n\nServes 4\n\nEnergy 506kcal; fat 17.9g; sat fat 2.6g; protein 17.3g; carbs 73g; sugars 13.9g; salt 1.2g; fibre 13.6g\n\n300g butternut squash\n\n1 carrot\n\nOlive oil\n\n4 fresh red chillies\n\n1 onion\n\n2 garlic cloves\n\n300g dried wholemeal penne\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n1 x 400g tin borlotti beans\n\n1 x 400g tin quality plum tomatoes\n\n2 sprigs fresh rosemary\n\nExtra-virgin olive oil\n\n1 tsp red-wine vinegar\n\nPeel the squash (deseed if needed) and scrub the carrot, then chop into 1cm chunks, and place in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with two tablespoons of olive oil. Prick and throw in the whole chillies (this will give you a warming, gentle heat), then cook for 10 minutes, or until lightly golden, stirring regularly.\n\nPeel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then add to the pan and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until softened and caramelised.\n\nWrap the pasta in a clean tea towel and bash with a rolling pin to crack and break it up (give it some welly!), then stir into the pan with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Tip in the beans (juices and all) and scrunch in the tomatoes, along with three tins\u2019 worth of water. Pop the lid on and simmer for 20 minutes, or until thickened and the pasta is cooked, stirring occasionally.\n\nMeanwhile, strip the rosemary leaves into a mortar, add a pinch of salt and bash to a paste with the pestle, then muddle in three tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and the vinegar. Swirl into the pan and serve up.\n\n\u2022 Recipes extracted from Veg by Jamie Oliver (Penguin Random House \u00a9 Jamie Oliver Enterprises Ltd 2019 Veg), out now at \u00a326.
