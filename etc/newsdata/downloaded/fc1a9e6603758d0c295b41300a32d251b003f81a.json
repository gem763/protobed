With his World Central Kitchen, Andr\u00e9s most recently donated tens of thousands of meals to victims of hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.\n\nHe acknowledged the impending event on social media, saying that he is \u201chumbled by the invitation\u201d to throw the first pitch. Andr\u00e9s added that he hoped the Nationals sweep the series and preclude the need for a Game 5: \u201cI really hope that by Saturday night all of WASHINGTON will be celebrating that the @Nationals are the 2019 @MLB World Series Champions.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m humbled by the invitation, and I realize is a big big big honor but I really hope that by Saturday night all of WASHINGTON will be celebrating that the @Nationals are the 2019 @MLB World Series Champions\u2026\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\u26be\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc6 https://t.co/V6EvP9L7Lr \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (@chefjoseandres) October 25, 2019\n\nBut the D.C. restaurant owner is also a frequent Trump detractor.\n\nIn August, Andr\u00e9s went on the attack against SoulCycle owner Stephen Ross merely because he supports President Trump. He has often tweeted out taunts at the president about immigration issues. He famously canceled a deal with Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel over a disagreement with the president\u2019s stance on immigration. And he has even railed against the president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nAndr\u00e9s does have his supporters. Trump-hating writer Gabe Hiatt was pleased to tell readers of Eater magazine that the choice of Andr\u00e9s to throw out the ceremonial pitch was ideal because it may \u201csteal attention from the president,\u201d who is set to attend the game.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @WTHuston.", "description": "The Washington Nationals have tapped chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, a virulent Trump hater, to throw out the first pitch during Game 5 of the World Series", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-937522610-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
