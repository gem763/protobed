What makes you believe that it's OK to come to a college campus, like this, when we are supposed to be promoting diversity on this campus, which is what we're taught. I don't understand what the purpose of this was.'\n\nCrucet wrote Wednesday on Twitter that the exchange included 'aggressive and ignorant' comments.\n\nShe later said it ended with students shouting at each other across the auditorium.\n\nCrucet has won acclaim for her work which draws on her own experiences as the daughter of Cuban immigrants. She is seen above giving a lecture at Bowling Green State University in March 2016\n\nShe said questions continued 'with other students apologizing for the strangeness and rudeness they felt their peer had shown.'\n\nCrucet later signed books after the event ended.\n\nBut that wasn't the end of the conflict.\n\nA video posted online shows some students later Wednesday burning copies of Crucet's book in a dormitory barbecue grill.\n\nA since-deleted Twitter account also showed a picture of the novel with its pages torn out.\n\nCrucet said university employees moved her Wednesday from her Statesboro hotel to a hotel in another town.\n\nThe author had been scheduled to give a similar talk Thursday on Georgia Southern's Savannah campus.\n\nGeorgia Southern spokeswoman Jennifer Wise said Crucet cancelled the second appearance, but Crucet wrote on Twitter Thursday that the event was cancelled because 'the administration said they could not guarantee my safety or the safety of its students on campus because of open carry laws.'\n\nA 2017 Georgia law lets people with a state concealed-weapons permit carry guns on parts of public college campuses.\n\nCrucet tweeted that she faced 'aggressive and ignorant' comments from white students during a question-and-answer session\n\nIn a statement she posted on Twitter, Crucet said 'nothing close' to what happened at Georgia Southern has happened at other colleges where she's given the same talk\n\nWise said Friday that university officials don't plan to discipline the students. University President Kyle Marrero sent an email to faculty, staff and students, saying that 'while it's within the students' First Amendment rights, book burning does not align with Georgia Southern's values nor does it encourage the civil discourse and debate of ideas.'\n\n'Yes, I wish our students had engaged in a reasoned discussion,' Marrero wrote Friday. 'And yes, I wish these discussions had not deteriorated or led to broad generalizations that paint an ugly picture about our university.'\n\nSome faculty groups were more critical.\n\n'We assert that destructive and threatening acts do not reflect the values of Georgia Southern University,' wrote Russell Willerton, chair of the Department of Writing and Linguistics, in a statement released on behalf of his department.\n\nCrucet said 'nothing close' to what happened at Georgia Southern has happened at other colleges where she's given the same talk.\n\nShe wrote that she fears for outsider students at Georgia Southern and called on the university to support them.\n\n'To think of those students watching as a group of their peers burned that story - effectively erasing them on the campus they are expected to think of as a safe space - feels devastating.'", "description": "Jennine Capo Crucet spoke Wednesday at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, where she says students argued with her before burning her book on campus.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/05/19617048-0-image-a-61_1570854140192.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
