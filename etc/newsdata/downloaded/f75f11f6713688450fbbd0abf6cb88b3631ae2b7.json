Click or tap Connect Sign into your Epic Games account.\n\nThe first event that will introduce drops is \u201cGame Jam Hollywood.\u201d The event brings together 16 different Fortnite Creative community builders to design new creative levels for the World Cup finals. People who want to collect some Fortnite drops can tune in on July 25th at 12:30pm ET.
