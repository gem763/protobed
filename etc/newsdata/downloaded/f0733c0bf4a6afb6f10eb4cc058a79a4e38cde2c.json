The Trumps\u2019 latest attempts to ding Biden\u2019s son over nepotism came not long after \u201cGood Morning America\u201d aired an interview with the 49-year-old on Tuesday amid ongoing allegations that he has benefited financially from his father\u2019s influential position.\n\nDuring the interview, Hunter Biden said it was \u201cpoor judgment,\u201d but not unethical, to accept a paid position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father was still vice president and acknowledged that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of things that wouldn\u2019t have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, Noah praised Biden for recognizing his privilege.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how the world works,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people get opportunities because of who their parents are.\u201d\n\nThe host noted that he has even been able to take advantage of his last name.\n\n\u201cI know the only reason I got to where I am today is probably because my great-great-grandfather built the ark,\u201d he joked. \u201cI accept that.\u201d\n\nHold up, so the Trump boys wanted to attack the Bidens and the issue they chose was nepotism??? pic.twitter.com/2fP8i68HyI \u2014 The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) October 17, 2019\n\nFor the Trumps, however, Biden\u2019s comments only fueled their belief that he had leveraged his father\u2019s position in politics for financial gain.\n\n\u201cDumpster fire at Biden HQ!\u201d Trump Jr. tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nDumpster fire at Biden HQ! \u201cIt is impossible for me to be on any of the boards I just mentioned without saying that I\u2019m the son of the vice president of the US. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happen in my life that if my name wasn\u2019t Biden\u201d Hunter Biden \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 15, 2019\n\nCritics on social media instantly cried foul.\n\n\u201cdude your name is literally your dad\u2019s full name,\u201d one person tweeted.\n\nAD\n\nAnother person wrote, \u201cImagine being *this* lacking in self-awareness.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr.'s resume:\n\n\n\n1. Ski bum\n\n\n\n2. Executive Vice President for the Trump Organization, his father's company\n\n\n\n3. Judge on the Apprentice, his father's TV show\n\n\n\n4. Anti-nepotism activist https://t.co/6Zlo1Pd2tq \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) October 15, 2019\n\nSeveral people also pointed to past instances of the Trump family appearing to express favorable views toward nepotism.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI like nepotism,\u201d Trump told Larry King in 2006. \u201cI think, you know, a lot of people say, \u2018Oh, nepotism.\u2019 Usually these are people without children. But I like nepotism.\u201d\n\nEric Trump has also described nepotism as \u201ckind of a factor of life,\u201d later adding that it is a \u201cbeautiful thing,\u201d the Hill reported in 2017.\n\nIn a Tuesday interview with Fox News\u2019s Laura Ingraham, Eric Trump stressed that his family was not like the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThe difference between us and Hunter is when my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business, right?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen his father became vice president of the United States, he got into international business.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump Jr. echoed his brother\u2019s remarks on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say that I am not part of who I am because of my father, that would be foolish,\u201d he told Hannity. \u201cBut the difference is, we did it as capitalists. We did it as business people. We didn\u2019t do it pretending and under the cloak of \u2018Joe\u2019s this great public servant, well here son, here\u2019s every job you\u2019ve ever had.'\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Trumps, both top executives within the Trump Organization, say they stopped pursuing new foreign deals once their father became president, but they have continued to operate and promote family businesses overseas, the New York Times reported this month. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have also maintained their foreign business ties while serving as White House advisers, The Washington Post\u2019s Jennifer Rubin wrote. On Monday, GQ published a lengthy article titled, \u201cHow Don Jr., Ivanka, and Eric Trump Have Profited Off Their Dad\u2019s Presidency,\u201d which included golf course and real estate deals among the family\u2019s sources of income.\n\nTrump Jr.'s comments did little to sway detractors on Wednesday, as a short clip of his interview quickly went viral. By early Thursday, the 26-second video had been viewed more than 1.25 million times.\n\n\u201cLocal arsonist lectures on fire safety measures,\u201d one person tweeted.\n\nIrony has died and asked not to be reincarnated again.
