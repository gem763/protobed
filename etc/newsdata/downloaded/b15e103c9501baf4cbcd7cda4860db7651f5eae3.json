It is hoped that this higher level of authorisation will make local authorities think twice about whether it is, in fact, proportionate to use directed surveillance and covert human intelligence sources to catch people guilty of fly tipping or allowing their dogs to foul in public.\n\nWhen RIPA was brought into law the intention was that it would be used to help tackle serious crimes and protect national security. In reality, as seems almost inevitable these days, it ended up being watered down. Hundreds of public bodies were granted powers, from Ofsted to the Charity Commission, without any public accountability or the need to be transparent about how the powers are being used.\n\nDespite the Coalition\u2019s initial efforts, these public authorities \u2013 many of which serve no law enforcement function \u2013 will still not be required to seek a magistrate\u2019s approval. Business as usual for the quangos, it seems.\n\nThe report, \u2018A legacy of suspicion\u2019, highlights the fundamental failings in RIPA, and the need for a thorough review of the past decade\u2019s surveillance orgy. For the Home Office to be considering adding to the mire of surveillance legislation by making Britain the first democratic state to monitor our emails, web use and social media messages without any review of RIPA seems dangerous at best and reckless at worst.\n\nIt is clear from this excellent report that the Protection of Freedoms Act must be the beginning of a serious discussion about civil liberties and privacy in modern Britain.
