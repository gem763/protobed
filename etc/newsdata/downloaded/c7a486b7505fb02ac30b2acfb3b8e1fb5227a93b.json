They listen patiently as their teacher makes a few announcements about tomorrow\u2019s timetable. Then, as every day, the teacher\u2019s final words: \u201cOK everybody, today\u2019s cleaning roster. Lines one and two will clean the classroom. Lines three and four, the corridor and stairs. And line five will clean the toilets.\u201d\n\nA few groans arise from line five, but the children stand up, grab the mops, cloths and buckets from the broom cupboard at the back of the classroom, and trot off to the toilets. Similar scenes are happening at schools across the country.\n\nMost first-time visitors to Japan are struck by how clean the country is. Then they notice the absence of litter bins. And street sweepers. So they\u2019re left with the question: how does Japan stay so clean?\n\nThe easy answer is that residents themselves keep it that way. \u201cFor 12 years of school life, from elementary school to high school, cleaning time is part of students\u2019 daily schedule,\u201d said Maiko Awane, assistant director of Hiroshima Prefectural Government\u2019s Tokyo office. \u201cIn our home life as well, parents teach us that it\u2019s bad for us not to keep our things and our space clean.\u201d\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Japan\u2019s unusual way to view the world\n\n\u2022 The complex art of apology in Japan\n\n\u2022 The truth about mindfulness\n\nIncluding this element of social consciousness in the school curriculum helps the children develop an awareness of, and pride in, their surroundings. Who wants to dirty or deface a school that they have to clean up themselves?\n\n\u201cI sometimes didn't want to clean the school,\u201d recalled freelance translator Chika Hayashi, \u201cbut I accepted it because it was part of our routine. I think having to clean the school is a very good thing because we learn that it\u2019s important for us to take responsibility for cleaning the things and places that we use.\u201d\n\nOn arriving at school, students leave their shoes in lockers and change into trainers. At home, too, people leave their street shoes at the entrance. Even workmen coming to your house will remove their shoes and pad around in their socks. And as the schoolchildren grow, their concept of what constitutes their space extends beyond the classroom to include their neighbourhood, their city and their country.\n\nSome examples of extreme Japanese cleanliness have gone viral, like the seven-minute Shinkansen train-cleaning ritual that has become a tourist attraction in its own right.\n\nEven Japan\u2019s football supporters are cleanliness-conscious. In World Cup football tournaments in Brazil (2014) and Russia (2018), the national team\u2019s fans amazed the world by staying behind to pick up rubbish from the stadium. The players also left their dressing room in immaculate condition. \u201cWhat an example for all teams!\u201d tweeted FIFA\u2019s general coordinator Priscilla Janssens.\n\n\u201cWe Japanese are very sensitive about our reputation in others\u2019 eyes,\u201d Awane said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want others to think we are bad people who don\u2019t have enough education or upbringing to clean things up.\u201d\n\nSimilar scenes unfold at Japanese music festivals. At the Fuji Rock festival, Japan\u2019s biggest and oldest festival, fans keep their rubbish with them until they find a bin. Smokers are instructed to bring a portable ashtray and to \u2018refrain from smoking where your smoke can affect other people\u2019, according to the festival website. How different to 1969\u2019s Woodstock festival, where Jimi Hendrix played to a handful of people amid a vast morass of trash.\n\nWe don\u2019t want others to think we are bad people who don\u2019t have enough education or upbringing to clean things up\n\nExamples of social awareness abound in daily life too. Around 08:00, for instance, office workers and shop staff clean the streets around their place of work. Children volunteer for the monthly community clean, picking up rubbish from the streets near their school. Neighbourhoods, too, hold regular street-cleaning events. Not that there\u2019s much to clean, because people take their litter home.\n\nEven banknotes emerge from ATM\u2019s as crisp and clean as a freshly starched shirt. Nevertheless, money gets dirty, which is why you never put it directly into someone\u2019s hand. In shops, hotels and even in taxis, you\u2019ll see a little tray to place the money. The other person then picks it up.\n\nInvisible dirt \u2013 germs and bacteria \u2013 are another source of concern. When people catch colds or flu, they wear surgical masks to avoid infecting other people. This simple act of consideration for others reduces the spread of viruses, thereby saving a fortune in lost work days and medical expenses.\n\nSo how did the Japanese become so clean-conscious?\n\nIt certainly isn\u2019t a new thing, as mariner Will Adams found when he anchored here in 1600, thus becoming the first Englishman to set foot in Japan. In his biography of Adams, Samurai William, Giles Milton notes \u2018the nobility were scrupulously clean\u2019, enjoying \u2018pristine sewers and latrines\u2019 and steam baths of scented wood at a time when the streets of England \u2018often overflowed with excrement\u2019. The Japanese \u2018were appalled\u2019 by the Europeans\u2019 disregard for personal cleanliness.\n\nIn part, this preoccupation is born of practical concerns. In a hot, humid environment like Japan\u2019s, food goes off quickly. Bacteria flourish. Bug life abounds. So good hygiene means good health.\n\nBut it goes deeper than that. Cleanliness is a central part of Buddhism, which arrived from China and Korea between the 6th and 8th Centuries. In fact, in the Zen version of Buddhism, which came to Japan from China in the 12th and 13th Centuries, daily tasks like cleaning and cooking are considered spiritual exercises, no different from meditating.\n\n\u201cIn Zen, all daily life activities, including having meals and cleaning the space, must be regarded as an opportunity to practice Buddhism. Washing off the dirt both physically and spiritually plays an important role in the daily practice,\u201d said Eriko Kuwagaki of Shinshoji Temple in Fukuyama, Hiroshima Prefecture.\n\nWashing off the dirt both physically and spiritually plays an important role in the daily practice\n\nIn Okakura Kakuro\u2019s The Book of Tea, his classic book about the tea ceremony and the Zen philosophy that infuses it, he writes that, in the room where the tea ceremony is held \u201c\u2026everything is absolutely clean. Not a particle of dust will be found in the darkest corner, for if any exists the host is not a tea master.\u201d\n\nOkakura wrote those words in 1906, but they still hold true today. Prior to a tea ceremony at the Seifukan tea house in Hiroshima\u2019s Shukkeien Garden, you\u2019ll see the tea master\u2019s kimono-clad assistant on her hands and knees dabbing the tatami floor with a roll of sticky brown-paper tape, picking up every speck of dust.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t all Buddhist nations as zealously clean as Japan? Well, long before the arrival of Buddhism, Japan already had its own indigenous religion: Shinto (meaning \u2018The Way of The Gods\u2019), said to enshrine the very soul of the Japanese identity. And cleanliness lies at the heart of Shinto. In the West, we are taught that cleanliness is next to godliness. In Shinto, cleanliness is godliness. So Buddhism\u2019s emphasis on cleanliness merely reinforced what the Japanese already practiced.\n\nA key concept in Shinto is kegare (impurity or dirt), the opposite of purity. Examples of kegare range from death and disease to virtually anything unpleasant. Frequent purification rituals are necessary to ward off kegare.\n\n\u201cIf an individual is afflicted by kegare, it can bring harm to society as a whole,\u201d explained Noriaki Ikeda, assistant Shinto priest at Hiroshima\u2019s Kanda Shrine. \u201cSo it is vital to practice cleanliness. This purifies you and helps avoid bringing calamities to society. That is why Japan is a very clean country.\u201d\n\nThis concern for others is understandable in the case of, say, infectious diseases. But it also works on more prosaic levels, like picking up your own rubbish. As Awane put it: \u201cWe Japanese believe we shouldn\u2019t bother others by being lazy and neglecting the trash we\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\nExamples of ritual purification abound in everyday life. Before entering a Shinto shrine, worshippers rinse their hands and mouth in a stone water basin at the entrance. Many Japanese take their new car to the shrine to be purified by the priest, who uses a feather duster-like wand called onusa that he waves around the car. He then opens the doors, bonnet and boot to purify the interior. The priest also purifies people by waving the onusa from side to side over them. He will even use it to purify land on which new building is about to commence.\n\nIf you live in Japan, you soon find yourself adopting the clean lifestyle. You stop blowing your nose in public, make use of the hand sanitizers provided for customers in shops and offices, and learn to sort your household rubbish into 10 different types to facilitate recycling.\n\nAnd, like Will Adams and his castaway crew back in 1600, you find your quality of life improves.\n\nThen, when you return to your homeland, you\u2019re shocked by barbarians who sneeze and cough in your face. Or stomp into your house in dirty shoes. Or, worse yet, have the toilet and shower \u2013 the dirty and the clean \u2013 in the same room. Unthinkable in Japan.\n\nBut there\u2019s still hope. After all, it also took a while for Pok\u00e9mon, sushi and camera phones to sweep the world.\n\nWhy We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
