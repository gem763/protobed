The idea was \u2018Bollywood meets Disney.\u2019\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nVarun proposed last year after whisking Anisha away on a helicopter ride, and popped the question with a crop circle in a field of wheat. The imaginative groom-to-be asked a farmer to write the message reading, ''Anisha, marry me?'' so it could be seen from the sky at a height of 200 feet.\n\nAfter getting the idea for their lavish wedding, the couple, from London, visited Disneyland Paris for a reconnaissance trip on Valentine's Day.\n\n\"People just enjoy the magic of the place,\" said Anisha, who works as an accountant. \u201cWhen we went on the rides, it was nice to see all the children enjoying the Disney magic.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nHer husband said their families were surprised by the decision, but came around after he explained that destination weddings were becoming more popular.\n\n\u201cParis is the city of love \u2014 that all played into the idea,\" said Varun, an internet entrepreneur. \u201cWe have been Disney fans for years, and we have organized big events together. We thought we would put our heads together and do something a bit different.\"\n\nThe wedding was estimated to have cost tens of thousands of pounds, but the couple, who have been together for five years, said that Disneyland Paris chipped in to subsidize the event. (Wedding packages at the resort are advertised on the Disneyland Paris website as costing between 32,000 euro ($35,000) and 55,000 euro ($60,000).\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nWhatever the cost, the wedding was seemingly worth the expense. Varun, whose favorite Disney film is \"The Jungle Book,\" said the wedding didn't wrap up until very late \u2014 or rather, very early in the morning.\n\n\"We had a disco, which was 'Moulin Rouge'-themed,\" he said. \"We both love dancing, it finished at 3 a.m.\"", "description": "The Londoners said their family didn't understand their idea at first, but eventually warmed up to the idea of doing things \"a bit different.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/fairy-tale-wedd-416890.jpg"}
