And before you notice that I did a promo instead of a joke: This is The Trailer.\n\nBrett M. Kavanaugh before his ceremonial swearing-in in the White House in October 2018. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nSeventy-two hours after a debate that could have reshaped their primary, the 2020 Democrats were talking about something completely different: Brett M Kavanaugh.\n\nIt all started when the New York Times published new reporting about the pre-midterm Kavanaugh hearings, based on the book by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. The Times's team said it corroborated an allegation of sexual assault against the future justice by a Yale classmate, Deborah Ramirez, allegations that surfaced and were dismissed as flimsy shortly before the confirmation vote.\n\n\u201cIt's more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath,\u201d tweeted Juli\u00e1n Castro, the first 2020 Democrat to react to the article. \u201cHe should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.\u201d\n\nBy Sunday morning, both Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who had opposed Kavanaugh \u2014 over worries that he could undermine Roe v. Wade \u2014 before any allegations came out, called for his impeachment.\n\n\u201cHe was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice,\u201d Harris wrote of Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cConfirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cLike the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the day, more candidates piled on, all of them taking the Times story as gospel.\n\n\u201cI support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable,\u201d said Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\n\u201cWe know he lied under oath,\u201d said Beto O'Rourke. Even Seth Moulton, whose candidacy never caught fire and ended after four months, jumped into the fray. \u201cHe should be impeached,\u201d Moulton tweeted, \u201csomething I called for months ago on the steps of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThere are not enough votes in the House to impeach the president; the odds of this Congress impeaching or removing Kavanaugh are nonexistent. But the Kavanaugh fight compares only to the 2016 election as a modern Democratic trauma. Not only did Democrats fail to stop his Supreme Court nomination, a consensus of Republicans and political strategists argued that by echoing accusations against him, Democrats energized conservative voters and tipped key Senate races toward the GOP.\n\n\u201cI hope that 'remember Kavanaugh' will be fighting words between now and the election,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the outgoing chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said shortly before the midterms, sentiments echoed by nearly every Republican.\n\n\u201cThat was such a mess,\u201d former senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cAnd what it did for those of us who were running, it crystallized how bad Washington is.\u201d\n\nThe saga turned Kavanaugh into an updated Clarence Thomas: Conservatives successfully placed him on the bench while simultaneously turning him into a martyr. He was living proof of how liberals smeared their enemies, of how President Trump would stand up to fight them. This month, when conservative writer Sohrab Ahmari debated conservative writer David French on political \u201ccourage,\u201d Ahmari argued that in standing by Kavanaugh, Trump proved his mettle; French pointed out that the last Republican president who refused to bend in a similar situation was George H.W. Bush and that his role in conservative history seems to shrink every year.\n\nDemocrats, in revisiting this fight, have no plan to win it. But in doing so, the 2020 field is demonstrating just how different the path to the presidency is than the path to control of the Senate. Republicans argued in 2018 that attacking Kavanaugh was driving up their base's enthusiasm, and tracking polls found an uptick from conservatives who had been less interested in the election.\n\nBut three of the Democrats' 2018 losses came in states that backed Trump by more than 20 points: Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. In Florida, the site of the fourth defeat, 56 percent of voters told exit pollsters that Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson's (Fla.) vote against Kavanaugh was \u201ca factor\u201d in their decision; those voters picked Nelson at a slightly higher rate than voters who said the vote was not a factor.\n\nFlorida is extremely relevant in the race to elect the next president; those other three states are not. And there's less information about how the Kavanaugh saga affected key swing states. While there were 2018 Senate races in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and while the Democratic senator in each state opposed Kavanaugh, exit pollsters did not bother asking about that. But national polling found that Kavanaugh was an unusually unpopular nominee, with a Washington Post-ABC News poll finding the country more disappointed than pleased by his confirmation by a 10-point margin.\n\nSince 2018, Democrats have also gotten more clarity about the president's ability to fire up conservatives with cultural conflict \u2014 no conflict is too small. The Kavanaugh battle didn't turn on the issues that liberals warned would come before the court; the initial plan for opposing Kavanaugh was actually to emphasize the risk a conservative majority posed to abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act. McCaskill, for example, announced her \u201cno\u201d vote by ignoring allegations against him and saying that Kavanaugh \u201crevealed his bias against limits on campaign donations, which places him completely out of the mainstream of this nation.\u201d\n\nWhat galvanized conservatives was the idea of a liberal mob trying to seize power and ruin lives, and the Trump reelection campaign has applied that frame to nearly everything \u2014 bans on plastic straws, mockery of the president's use of a Sharpie to alter a map of a hurricane's path, the theoretical threat posed by environmentalists to hamburgers. Trump on Sunday morning went after the new reporting, accusing the \u201cLameStream Media\u201d of working with Democrats.\n\nIn the end, the Kavanaugh fight made Democrats and Republicans a lot more cynical. What truly mattered for Democrats, in 2018, was that they were defending so many Senate seats in deep red states. The 2020 Democrats know that \u201cremember Kavanaugh\u201d was a strong rallying cry in Indiana and Missouri; they're betting that in the Midwest, and in especially in their own party's primaries, the court fight is remembered in a very different way.\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\u201cAs Joe Biden proves a durable candidate, opponents delicately raise his age,\u201d by Matt Viser\n\nDemocrats hear it, and voters often say it.

(David J. Phillip/AP)\n\nUp until the Houston debate, Democrats didn't know what to make of Beto O'Rourke's sharp turn on gun control. The former phenom was polling in the low single digits; his fundraising, one of the factors that made some Democrats see him as a 2020 contender, had begun to dry up.\n\nBut O'Rourke's onstage call for mandatory assault weapon buybacks spurred Democrats to do what comes naturally: panic. Decades of work promising conservative voters that they are not, in fact, \u201ccoming for their guns,\u201d were being undone by one struggling presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cMy sons and I have gone skeet shooting and hunting,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), an early supporter of Joe Biden's campaign, said in a Friday interview with CNN. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t think having our presidential candidates, like Congressman O\u2019Rourke did, say that we\u2019re going to try to take people\u2019s guns against their will is a wise either policy or political move.\u201d\n\nCoons got reinforcements Sunday when Pete Buttigieg, who did not get a chance to respond to the \u201cbuyback\u201d talk onstage, appeared on CNN's \u201cState of the Union\u201d and denounced it.\n\n\u201cLook, right now we have an amazing moment on our hands,\u201d the South Bend, Ind., mayor said. \u201cWe have agreement among the American people for not just universal background checks, but we have a majority in favor of red flag laws, high capacity magazines, banning the new sale of assault weapons. This is a golden moment to finally do something because we've been arguing about this for as long as I've been alive, when even this president and even Mitch McConnell are at least pretending to be open to reforms.\u201d\n\nButtigieg's answer was surprising in one way: He's repeatedly warned that Democrats will be accused of radicalism no matter what position they take. \u201cIt's time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say,\u201d Buttigieg argued in the Detroit debate two months ago. \u201cLet's stand up for the right policy, go up there and defend it.\u201d That completely clashed with his argument on buybacks, admitting that some policies were going to lose votes that Democrats might otherwise win.\n\nBut the entire debate about buybacks, which do not have the legislative support to pass in either house of Congress, is really about Republican attacks. There are two schools of thought in the party. One, which Buttigieg seemed to belong to before, was that the dishonesty of Trump-era Republican politicking lowered the cost of taking left-wing positions. Democrats who pointedly distanced themselves from the party's left continued to be linked to it.\n\n\u201cIf we learned one thing from the Obama years, it's that Republicans are going to call us socialists no matter what we do,\u201d actress and 2018 New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon said at last year's Netroots Nation conference. \u201cWe might as well give them the real thing.\u201d\n\nThe second school of thought is that voters can tell the difference between a false attack and a fair one. Nixon, after all, did not win her primary; the Democratic victors in 2018 included dozens of moderates who were hard to peg as left-wing. In Houston, for example, Democrat Lizzie Fletcher defeated a Medicare-for-all supporter in a primary, then faced attack ads accusing her of supporting \u201ca government takeover of health care.\u201d Fletcher pushed back, and local media excoriated the Republican nominee for lying about her position; in Congress, Fletcher is one of the minority of House Democrats not supportive of Medicare-for-all.\n\nThe idea of mandatory assault weapon buybacks is newer than Medicare-for-all, but it has something in common: It's more popular than Democrats often say. In the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, 52 percent of Americans and 51 percent of registered voters said they favored a program to \u201crequire assault weapon owners to turn in those weapons in exchange for payment.\u201d Other polls have found less support, but never less than 40 percent. An idea that's already inspiring Democratic panic is, at the moment, more popular than a wall across the entire U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 something nearly no Republicans oppose. And O'Rourke is now trying to tap into Democratic frustration at the party's hand-wringing.\n\n\u201cLeaving millions of weapons of war on the streets because Trump and McConnell are 'at least pretending to be open to reforms'?\" O'Rourke tweeted Sunday. \u201cThat calculation and fear is what got us here in the first place. Let\u2019s have the courage to say what we believe and fight for it.\u201d\n\nAD WATCH\n\nRalph Abraham for governor, \u201cFor them.\u201d Louisiana's gubernatorial elections typically consist of two rounds \u2014 a \u201cjungle primary\u201d that every candidate competes in (this year, Oct. 12) and a runoff (Nov. 16) if no candidate topped 50 percent of the vote. Abraham, the highest-polling Republican in Louisiana's race for governor, has released a series of ads that focus more on his biography (a veteran and a medical doctor) than on any issue, because to win, he needs to hold Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards under 50 percent; simply bringing \u201cJBE\u201d down before that doesn't guarantee Abraham a runoff slot.\n\nEddie Rispone for governor, \u201cHome.\u201d The self-funding multimillionaire in Louisiana's race for governor has been running his own effort to boost his favorables; his latest ad spends 30 seconds describing his love for the state and how he found love after his first wife died. Only at the end does he suggest something's amiss: \u201cToday's challenges threaten what we love. Our economy is the slowest in America. A generation is leaving, just to find work.\u201d\n\nJohn Bel Edwards for governor, \u201cHarder right.\u201d In 2015, when he crushed scandal-plagued former senator David Vitter to win his first term, Louisiana's Democratic governor heavily emphasized his military service. He does the same in his latest spot, narrated entirely by veterans who know Edwards personally and who declare that he has \u201cthe leadership qualities we were taught at West Point.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox three times a week.

He's cutting a few events from his schedule \u2014 the busiest, easily, of any candidate who appeared in Thursday night's debate \u2014 to heal a sore throat that was making him sound unusually hoarse.\n\nTulsi Gabbard. She appeared on Dave Rubin's podcast, which has a relatively conservative audience, and said she favored some abortion restrictions outside the Democratic Party's platform: \u201cUnless a woman\u2019s life or severe health consequences is at risk, then there shouldn\u2019t be an abortion in the third trimester.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg. He has added a campaign bus tour, his first, to the events around this coming weekend's Iowa steak fry.\n\nTim Ryan. He declared solidarity with United Auto Workers ahead of a strike that will begin at midnight.\n\nWHAT I'M WATCHING\n\nBernie Sanders feels your pain. Every candidate for president is expected to hold town hall meetings \u2014 lots of them \u2014 in Iowa and New Hampshire. Bernie Sanders's version of the town hall is different, in a way that is starting to get results. Often, instead of asking voters to line up and ask questions, he polls the audience on their biggest problems and urges them to vent.\n\nThis approach led to a dramatic conversation in Reno, Nev., where a veteran named John Weigel (no relation) said that he was in stage 4 of Huntington's disease and was exhausted by the fight to get his insurance to cover expenses.\n\n\u201cI do not have the energy to fight these people,\u201d Weigel said. \u201cEvery time I get on the phone with them, they piss me off, and I can't deal with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm looking at a bill that says account balance $139,000,\u201d Sanders asked. \u201cHow are you going to pay it off?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can't, I can't, I'm going to kill myself,\u201d Weigel said.\n\n\u201cStop it,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cYou're not going to kill yourself.\u201d\n\nSanders ended the exchange by saying that he would talk to Weigel afterward, and for the first time in a long time, cable news picked up an exchange from one of the candidate's rallies. But the Sanders strategy is designed to find moments such as this, with the goal of cutting through coverage that assumes two things \u2014 that Joe Biden has the most direct emotional connection to Democratic voters and that Sanders's plans are unworkable and unpopular.\n\nCOUNTDOWN\n\n... one day until former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford hits the campaign trail\n\n... one day until Democrats speak at South Carolina's Galivants Ferry Stump\n\n... two days until the AFL-CIO's \u201cWorkers\u2019 Presidential Summit\u201d in Philadelphia\n\n... five days until the One Iowa LGBT forum\n\n... six days until the Polk County, Iowa, Democratic steak fry", "description": "In this edition: Why Democrats are fighting about Kavanaugh again, why Beto O'Rourke is betting on gun buybacks, and why Bernie Sanders has become a feel-your-pain candidate.", "authors": ["David Weigel", "National Reporter Covering Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/972aa071d5377ced52ef3854c5c6dc96-2235-1516-70-8-KS2CZMGX3EI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
