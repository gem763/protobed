We are off to Cyprus \u2013 never been there before, but I\u2019ve been told there is a wonderful kids club at the hotel.\n\nWith the kids off my hands for few hours a day \u2013 and my dad also happy to lose them, I might finally have a holiday.\n\nI\u2019m visualising lying on a beach with a nice cold drink and my F Scott Fitzgerald short stories, listening to the noise of the lapping waves.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAs a single parent with two children, Lola, three, and Liberty, one, and an elderly single dad, Brian, 86, we have been holidaying together a lot since my partner died. We have never managed to have a relaxing holiday \u2013 but surely this time it will be different?\n\nAt his age, my dad should really be in a home, being spoon-fed by an underpaid carer, but he ends up lugging all the buckets and spades and nappy bags onto the beach. People don\u2019t know what to make of us \u2013 is he a doting grandfather, my elderly husband or a seedy sugar daddy?\n\nBut nothing could have prepared us for the horror of what lay ahead in Cyprus.\n\nI knew it was a child-friendly hotel, but when we entered the canteen, with screaming and crying children, dropping fish fingers and pasta shells everywhere, I suddenly felt like I was trapped on an ocean liner that I couldn\u2019t get off.\n\nInstead of fighting over sun loungers, it was fighting over high chairs and the last scoop of bubble gum ice cream.\n\nBut the photos looked so appealing in the brochure! The kids looked so happy and the hotel looked like a peaceful sanctuary.\n\nBy the time I get my dad and the kids\u2019 breakfast the next morning, from the help yourself buffet, and take it all outside to our table, I feel like a waitress, not a guest. My dad\u2019s sense of direction is so bad, that in these big hotels he can\u2019t leave the table alone, because I don\u2019t know where he will end up.\n\nBut when my children are turned away from the kids\u2019 club because they are under four, and need an adult to accompany them at all times, I nearly faint.\n\nOh my god. I can\u2019t spend the holiday indoors in a soft play area.\n\nThe toddler pool with slide, heaving with children, is like a scene from Alton Towers.\n\nMy dad, who by this point had developed some extreme wheeze, possibly due to a dust cloud from Syria overhead, gives the green light for us to use the hotel\u2019s babysitting service.\n\n\u201cFantastic,\u201d I cheer. \u201cNow I can enjoy the beach.\u201d We are given a Russian nanny, Nadia, who explains in pidgin English that there are a lot of rich Russians at the hotel in Cyprus, who have bought property here to get EU membership, so they must enter the country from time to time.\n\nInteresting, I think, as she takes the kids off to the kid\u2019s club while I finally lie on a sun lounger next to my dad wheezing. We now think it might be a nut allergy. I\u2019m trying so hard to be mindful and in the present, even trying to remember that TM meditation course I did, but my mind is racing (it\u2019s mad):\n\n\u201cI must make the most of every second relaxing as it\u2019s the last chance saloon before going back to work after maternity leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are my kids? They have been away from me for one hour. I\u2019m here on holiday with them. Why aren\u2019t I with them?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I need a break. When will I ever get one again?\u201d\n\nI must make the most of every second relaxing as it\u2019s the last chance saloon before going back to work after maternity leave\n\n\u201cOh god this time next week I will be back in the office after a whole year. It can\u2019t be happening. No, no, no, just don\u2019t think about it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod is dad ok \u2013 does he need to go to hospital?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole point was the nanny on the beach to help me, not take them away from me all afternoon.\u201d\n\nBut every time I go to visit the kids, the nanny scowls at me as if I am supervising her. Used to wealthy parents who want her to disappear with the children, I feel bereft.\n\nI catch her fleeing with my children to our room through the bushes so they don\u2019t see me. I demand that she understands that I want us all to hang out together.\n\nBut, it is all getting lost in translation and fearing that I don\u2019t trust her, she says: \u201cJust relax I know vot I am doing. You can trust. I take them to bubble show.\u201d\n\nBy this point, I am so frustrated and tired. I didn\u2019t know the sleepless nights would be caused by my dad, not the baby.\n\nHis wheezing is so bad, he has decamped to the balcony of our family room, to sleep on Lola\u2019s giant inflatable unicorn.\n\nUnfortunately, the truth is, this holiday is like being stuck inside Lola\u2019s nursery school for a week without any escape.\n\nOne good thing that has come out of it, though, is the realisation that, on reflection, it will be a relief to go back to work. The office is certainly as challenging as going on holiday with my dad and the kids.", "description": "There\u2019s nothing like the feeling of booking a holiday on my dad\u2019s credit card.
