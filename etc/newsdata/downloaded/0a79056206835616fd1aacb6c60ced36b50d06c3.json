Seitz, has published a blistering \u201cpastoral letter\u201d denouncing President Trump\u2019s border wall as a \u201cmonument to hate\u201d and a symbol of exclusion and racism.\n\nPulling no punches, Bishop Seitz writes that xenophobia is \u201cravaging the United States\u201d in a desperate effort by Caucasians to shore up white privilege and perpetuate \u201cinstitutionalized racism.\u201d\n\nThis racism targets Latinos in a particular way, the bishop writes in his letter titled \u201cNight Will Be No More,\u201d and although \u201cthis hatred of Latinos is not new,\u201d the grave racism directed at Latinos today \u201chas reached a dangerous fever pitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cAncient demons have been reawakened and old wounds opened,\u201d he proposes, and this racism shows itself in an acute way in the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\n\u201cOur highest elected officials have used the word \u2018invasion\u2019 and \u2018killer\u2019 over 500 times to refer to migrants, treated migrant children as pawns on a crass political chessboard, insinuated that judges and legislators of color are un-American, and have made wall-building a core political project,\u201d the bishop asserts, and while the wall precedes Mr. Trump, he has made it a central plank of his platform.\n\n\u201cThe wall is a powerful symbol in the story of race,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt has helped to merge nationalistic vanities with racial projects.\u201d\n\nThe wall \u201cis not just a tool of national security,\u201d Seitz claims. \u201cMore than that, the wall is a symbol of exclusion, especially when allied to an overt politics of xenophobia. It is an open wound through the middle of our sister cities of El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wall deepens racially charged perceptions of how we understand the border as well as Mexicans and migrants. It extends racist talk of an \u2018invasion\u2019. It perpetuates the racist myth that the area south of the border is dangerous and foreign and that we are merely passive observers in the growth of narco-violence and the trafficking of human beings and drugs,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe wall is a physical reminder of the failure of two friendly nations to resolve their internal and bi-national issues in just and peaceful way,\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cThe wall kills families and children. There will be a day when after this wall has come crumbling down we will look back and remember the wall as a monument to hate,\u201d he concludes.\n\nThose who support the wall are propagating racist attitudes, moved by an unconfessed disdain for people of color, he suggests.\n\n\u201cIf we are honest, racism is really about advancing, shoring up, and failing to oppose a system of white privilege and advantage based on skin color,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhen this system begins to shape our public choices, structure our common life together and becomes a tool of class, this is rightly called institutionalized racism.\u201d\n\n\u201cAction to build this system of hate and inaction to oppose its dismantling are what we rightly call white supremacy,\u201d he states.\n\nIn conclusion, the bishop appeals to President Trump and officials of the other two branches of the federal government to stop deporting those who enter the country illegally and to open the borders to refugees.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of immigration reform, I also renew my appeal to the President of the United States, to the Members of Congress and to the jurists of our highest Courts,\u201d he declares. \u201cI beg you to listen to the voice of conscience and halt the deportation of all those who are not a danger to our communities, to stop the separation of families, and to end once and for all the turning back of refugees and death at the border.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz has published a blistering \u201cpastoral letter\u201d denouncing Trump\u2019s border wall as a \u201cmonument to hate\u201d and exclusion.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
