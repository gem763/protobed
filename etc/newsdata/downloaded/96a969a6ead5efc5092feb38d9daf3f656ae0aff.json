The latest comes from Nikkei, in a report that claims Google \u201chas begun test production of a 5G smartphone that it may unveil as soon as next week.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are already going into mass production, while the 5G device is in test production. This could indicate the company plans to announce the devices simultaneously, but the 5G might not be available until a few weeks later.\n\nApple decided to skip the 5G train this year, with rumors currently pointing to a 2020 launch. Beating Apple to the punch could give Google a leg-up in 5G technology, although it\u2019s far from the first Android manufacturer to support the nascent technology.\n\n5G allows for dramatically faster downloads \u2013 fast enough to compete with a decent broadband connection \u2013 and very low latency. It theoretically tops out at around 1 to 10 Gbps, and though real-world speeds will be a fraction of that, it\u2019s still a major improvement. The low latency also makes serious mobile gaming more feasible too. The infrastructure isn\u2019t quite there to make it a very useful upgrade for most people at the moment \u2013 especially if you live outside of a major city \u2013 but wireless companies are rapidly building more 5G towers.\n\nOn that note, we\u2019ll likely hear an announcement of 5G availability on Google\u2019s Fi network during the event. Last we heard, Fi would use Sprint\u2019s 5G network, but Google could have more details for us come next week.\n\nThe Nikkei report also says the company may have a new smartwatch and laptop on the way, two products we\u2019ve heard a few rumblings about, but not much in the way of concrete details. Hopefully Google still has some surprises left for next week.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F09%2FGoogle-Pixel-4.jpg&signature=ce0581645733538511796dd0ddfd60b2", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
