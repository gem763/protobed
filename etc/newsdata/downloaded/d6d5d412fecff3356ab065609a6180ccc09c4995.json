He was stopped in the 10th round of his boxing rules contest against Floyd Mayweather in 2017, and Khabib Nurmagomedov submitted him in the fourth round of a wild fight at UFC 229 the following year. The back-to-back defeats mean he has not won a match since 2016.\n\nThis, combined with troubles in his personal life \u2014 from slapping the phone out of a fan's hand and walking away with it, to throwing a punch at an older man in a Dublin pub \u2014 has seen him frozen out of the UFC's biggest fights.\n\nRead more: Khabib Nurmagomedov is freezing Conor McGregor out of the UFC's biggest fights, and he's not the only one\n\nThe dominant lightweight Tony Ferguson, for example, told ESPN last month that McGregor is \"irrelevant\" because he hasn't competed all year. Nurmagomedov also said the only athlete deserving of a shot at his UFC lightweight title is Ferguson, rather than McGregor.\n\nBut just weeks after being called an \"irrelevant\" has-been, McGregor is now linked with four fighters, three of whom are contracted to the UFC.\n\nJustin Gaethje, Frankie Edgar, and Dustin Poirier linked with a McGregor bout. Getty Images\n\nLast month, the in-form wrestler Justin Gaethje destroyed Donald \"Cowboy\" Cerrone in a single round, then said he'd happily \"f--- up\" Conor McGregor.\n\nThe experienced bantamweight Frankie Edgar challenged McGregor to a fight just months after the Irishman asked the UFC president Dana White for the same thing. \"I told him I want to fight him,\" Edgar said this month. \"I told the UFC I want to fight him.\"\n\nMcGregor beat Dustin Poirier in 2014. However, the American wrestler has since risen to no.2 in the UFC's lightweight rankings and tweeted last week that he wants to fight the Irishman adding it could even happen on St. Patrick's Day.\n\nA boxer also wants McGregor\n\nMcGregor has fought one professional boxing rules bout, and though he lost conclusively to Mayweather, the event scooped him a $100 million payday.\n\nThough he will unlikely match that milestone with another foray in the sport, he could still attract a good payday fighting for a world title. His compatriot Luke Keeler, who we've been told McGregor angrily rang earlier this year, has offered him a route to a title.\n\nKeeler is a top-ranked middleweight with the World Boxing Organization (WBO) and told Business Insider he expects to fight the current champion Demetrius Andrade on St. Patrick's Day in New York or Boston in 2020. Should he win, then he hopes to entice McGregor into a Dublin boxing ring so they can settle their war of words.\n\nRead more: An Irish boxer is challenging Conor McGregor to 'stay sober' long enough so they can end their war of words and fight for a world title\n\nAll Keeler hopes is that McGregor \"stays sober\" for long enough that it makes his dream match-up a reality.\n\nLuke Keeler.

McGregor's long-time trainer John Kavanagh runs the gym.\n\nRead more: Take a look inside the new and improved Straight Blast Gym where John Kavanagh trains Conor McGregor and James Gallagher\n\nThe MMA coach Kavanagh, who trains several top fighters like the Bellator prospect James Gallagher and the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship brawler Artem Lobov, was reticent to talk too much about McGregor and any potential comeback. However, he did say his most famous athlete, \"loves martial arts and competing.\"\n\nWhen asked about potential comeback opponents like Edgar and Keeler, Kavanagh told us: \"Bring them all on.\"\n\nHe said: \"He's in phenomenal shape right now and we're back training away. I don't have any scoop to give you about an upcoming fight, I don't know of any. I tell those guys, the management team and him, 'Let me know when you have it.'\n\n\"When something's confirmed, I'm sure I'll be told. We'll train for it, we'll fight, and that's that. I hear the rumors, same as you. I don't even bother texting him about it because there's a new rumor every day. I'd love to see him against anybody. Bring them all on.\n\n\"I'm his coach, I love mixed martial arts, and I believe he's arguably the best in the world.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nThe 22-year-old Irish fighter being compared to Conor McGregor could actually be a greater example of 'modern' MMA\n\nA fight against Dillon Danis would be 'very embarrassing' for YouTuber Jake Paul, MMA coach John Kavanagh says\n\nThe real Tyson Fury is quiet, shy, and introverted, according to an Irish boxer who knows him well", "description": "Three UFC fighters and one middleweight boxer reportedly in line to fight Conor McGregor.
