They already trailed the Chicago Cubs in the National League wild-card race, and now they had lost the irreplaceable superstar that had made them contenders at all.\n\n\u201cIt felt like the dream had died for this season,\u201d Brewers owner Mark Attanasio told reporters in Milwaukee this weekend.\n\nSuffice it to say that dream remains very much alive. In fact, it continues to flourish: With just six games remaining, the Brewers\u2019 place in the postseason now seems all but certain\u2014even with a Yelich-sized chasm in their lineup.\n\nThe Brewers have thrived without Yelich, going a major-league best 11-2 since his injury in the first inning on Sept. 10, including that night\u2019s victory at Marlins Park. Their improbable resurgence has coincided with an utter meltdown by the Cubs, who just suffered their first-four game sweep to the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field since 1921. It has put the Brewers on the verge of clinching their second consecutive trip to October and in a tight race with the Washington Nationals to host the one-game play-in next week.\n\n\u201cTeams can go in two directions when something like that happens,\u201d Attanasio said. \u201cThey can give up, or they can pull together. This group pulled together.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the Brewers\u2019 offense has sagged without Yelich, who still leads the NL in batting average (.329) and OPS (1.100), to go along with his 44 home runs, 97 RBIs and 30 stolen bases. They\u2019ve posted a .220 batting average, fourth-worst in baseball, and seen their OPS drop to .720, down from .770 with Yelich.\n\nBut their pitching, which had been only average for the first 5 1/2 months of the schedule,\n\nCatcher Yasmani Grandal and reliever Josh Hader after Hader closes out a game.

Led by their dynamic bullpen\u2014and manager Craig Counsell\u2019s aggressive use of it\u2014the Brewers lead the sport with a 2.56 ERA since Sept. 10, holding batters to a .188 batting average.\n\nLacking a reliable starting rotation, the Brewers lean on their relievers more than any team in the NL, trusting them to record more than 12 outs outs per game. (Conversely, the Nationals, their likely wild-card foe, ask their bullpen to handle just nine outs a game.) If not for the fact that the Brewers need to navigate a 162-game season without their pitchers\u2019 arms falling off, they probably would push their relievers even more.\n\nCase in point: Lately, with the benefit of expanded September rosters and less concern for long-term preservation, Brewers starters have averaged just over four innings and 70 pitches a game since Yelich went down. The Brewers\u2019 bullpen owns a 2.32 ERA dating back to Sept. 10.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s win over the Pittsburgh Pirates, for instance, Counsell removed starter Brandon Woodruff after he retired the first six batters he faced. He turned the game over to a collection of five relievers who didn\u2019t allow a single earned run over the next seven frames. That includes 1 1/3 innings by All-Star closer Josh Hader, who has already appeared in the same amount of games this month as he did in any other month in 2019.\n\nThe Brewers have shown that they can win this way in the playoffs. Counsell mixed and matched the Brewers to within one win of the World Series last season, even though their starters averaged 3 1/3 innings in their 10 postseason games.\n\n\u201cThe pitching was the key to this stretch here,\u201d Counsell said Sunday. \u201cWe shared the outs, and we did it really, really well.\u201d\n\nChristian Yelich injured his knee on Sept. 10.

They have feasted against the league\u2019s bottom-feeders, with 17 of their final 20 games coming against the Marlins, San Diego Padres, Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies, teams with a collective winning percentage of about .420.\n\nDuring their 11-2 stretch, they\u2019ve outscored opponents, 64-38, even with a 10-0 loss to the Cardinals during that time. If they had to move forward without Yelich, it happened at the best possible time, especially with rival Cubs imploding.\n\nPlayoff teams should take advantage of inferior competition, and the Brewers have done just that. Even better for the Brewers, they own the tiebreaker over the Nationals by virtue of their 4-2 record against them this season. That means they very well could end up playing for a spot in the division series at Miller Park, where they have gone 49-32 this season.\n\nConventional wisdom would suggest that the Brewers probably couldn\u2019t advance all that far in the playoffs without Yelich, especially with the wild-card winner set to challenge the Los Angeles Dodgers. But conventional wisdom would suggest that the Brewers would\u2019ve folded without Yelich\u2014yet here they are.\n\n\u201cI saw a bunch of memes on Twitter and Instagram poking fun at the team, saying that once Yeli was out, that we were done,\u201d first baseman Eric Thames said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the complete opposite.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "description": "Christian Yelich fractured his kneecap and is out for the season, but the Brewers have leaned on their relievers to put themselves on the verge of clinching a wild-card spot", "authors": ["Jared Diamond"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109921/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
