Now it's center stage for his first debate", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Democrat Tom Steyer, a businessman and political donor, spoke Aug. 11, 2019, at the Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair. Des Moines Register\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Tom Steyer said he smiled when heard House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nSteyer founded Need to Impeach in October 2017 \u2014 a group with the singular goal of impeaching Trump. Since then, he has pumped millions of dollars into the group.\n\nIn doing so, he put his stamp on Trump's impeachment before many of the Democratic presidential candidates were even thinking about it \u2013 and he takes responsibility for helping to push the congressional investigations into Trump into a full-blown impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, Steyer told USA TODAY, \u201cwas a sign the American political system was working.\u201d\n\n\"The Need To Impeach movement has been around for almost two years, pushing and pushing and pushing,\" he said, as part of a \"drumbeat over two years of building momentum.\"\n\nNow, with House Democrats' impeachment inquiry rapidly escalating, Steyer finds himself making his first appearance on the debate stage while one of his signature issues is finally dominating headlines.\n\nWhile his political history is built around two organizations he has founded and funded \u2014 NextGen America, focused on climate change, and Need to Impeach \u2014 the debate will test his ability to stand out in the crowded Democratic field and move beyond being defined by those groups.\n\nOn stage: 12 candidates, one night: Here's who has made the October debate\n\nSteyer, 62, believes he has an opening in the field due to his relative lack of political experience compared with other candidates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an outsider, they\u2019re insiders,\u201d he said. Other than entrepreneur Andrew Yang, every other candidate on the Democratic debate stage is a current or former elected official.\n\nBut as fellow Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., rails against the \u201cmillionaires and the billionaires\u201d on the campaign trail, Steyer is testing whether the Democratic primary electorate has the appetite for a billionaire presidential candidate to take on the current billionaire occupant of the White House.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate, Tom Steyer speaks to attendees during the Blue Jamboree on October 5, 2019 in North Charleston, South Carolina.

Forbes estimates Steyer's personal worth at $1.6 billion.\n\nHe left Farallon in 2012 seeking to get involved in politics and the environmental movement, starting NextGen in 2013. The group organized voters around environmental issues and its PAC, NextGen Action, spent millions of dollars on political races in the next several election cycles.\n\nHeather Hargreaves, Steyer\u2019s campaign manager and the former Executive Director of NextGen America, called him \u201ca really genuine person in the way that people don\u2019t expect.\u201d\n\nAfter years of participating from the sidelines, and months after saying he wouldn't join the race, Steyer threw his hat into the Democratic presidential contest in July.\n\nore: Gabbard considering boycotting October debate, claims DNC and media are 'trying to hijack' election\n\nSteyer\u2019s campaign points to his ties to the environmental movement and grassroots activism as evidence of his experience beyond the boardroom.\n\nRev. Lennox Yearwood Jr., a friend of Steyer and the head of the Hip Hop Caucus, a national youth voter outreach organization, told USA TODAY he first met Steyer at a February 2013 rally against the Keystone XL pipeline in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI met him in the streets,\u201d Yearwood recalls. He first noticed that Steyer was wearing a tie. At a rally.\n\n\"That\u2019s what stood out to me most,\" Yearwood said with a laugh.\n\nDespite the appearance, Steyer's commitment to environmental activism on a deep level was clear, Yearwood said.\n\n\u201cYou could tell he was definitely deeply thinking about\" climate change, Yearwood said. \u201cHe really wants to know what the movement is doing, not just being out here.\u201d\n\nThanks for noticing my favorite belt! I bought it on a trip to Kenya from female artisans. I wear it as a reminder not to be so formal, and also as a symbol that the world is a better place when we educate women and girls. https://t.co/PoqRorGUPj \u2014 Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) August 20, 2019\n\nWhen asked about his wealth and ability to compete in the Democratic field, Steyer pointed to his \u201c10-year record as an outsider\u201d and cited his experience leading ballot initiatives in California that took on \u201ccorporate power.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs an outsider, I've been doing things that people in the inside have been unwilling or unable to do,\u201d he says. \u201cLook, take a look at Need to Impeach. That was clearly an outside effort, organizing people who were from outside Washington, D.C., to stand up and insist that the government do what's right, and hold the most corrupt president in American history to account.\u201d\n\nSteyer believes Democratic primary voters care less about the identity of the candidate so much as they do the message.\n\n\u201cThis is all about message,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cDo I have something that is different, important, and true, that resonates with Democratic voters? If I don't have that, then I'm not a viable candidate, period. The end.\u201d\n\n\u2018We need a new vision of America\u2019\n\nIn Steyer\u2019s view, America needs a new vision to move beyond conservative economic policies from the 1980s \u2014 and hebelieves he alonecan present that vision to the American people.\n\n\u201cI think we're living in a framework of life and government, put out by Ronald Reagan in 1980, which has been disastrous for America, that his ideas of how to think about the country have proven to be shockingly wrong, and nearsighted and destructive,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cAnd I think that we need a new vision of America from the one that he put forward, and that is still impacting our politics and our framework for government.\u201d\n\nSteyer\u2019s campaign has since rolled out an economic plan that, among other provisions, would raise the national minimum wage to $15 an hour, allow for two years of free college, and repeal the tax cuts passed by Republicans in 2017.\n\nDespite his net worth, he supports redistributive economic policies like a 1% wealth tax on the richest 0.1% of Americans, though the tax is not as high as similar policies proposed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nMore: 4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like.\n\n\u2018The biggest impact\u2019\n\nInitially, Steyer said he would not be running for president in 2020 and would instead be working to support NextGen and Need to Impeach.\n\nBut by July 9, he announced his bid for the presidency, becoming the 24th Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nHe argued that he would try to get money out of politics and bring climate change to the front of the agenda.\n\n\"Almost every major single intractable problem, at the back of it, you see a big-money interest for whom stopping progress, stopping justice is really important to their bottom line,\" he said in his announcement video.\n\nHis candidacy was welcomed by some environmental groups, especially after climate-focused candidate Washington Gov. Jay Inslee bowed out toward the end of August.\n\nTiernan Sittenfeld, the Senior Vice President for Government Affairs for the League of Conservation Voters, said \u201cwe were really happy about his justice-centered climate plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom Steyer clearly understands the urgency of the climate crisis, and he's made climate action one of his very top priorities for years,\u201d she explained. \u201cI think he brings an important voice for climate leadership and climate action to the presidential race.\u201d\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters has not yet made a presidential endorsement for 2020.\n\nBuying his way into the race?\n\nDespite the attention he has gotten from environmental advocates, some fellow Democratic candidates have turned their ire on Steyer ahead of the debate \u2014 and used him as an opportunity to fundraise.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign sent out a fundraising email on Sept. 29 with the subject: \u201cTom Steyer,\u201d appealing for donations with the worry that they were being outspent by \u201cbillionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer.\u201d\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock has accused Steyer of using his wealth to \u201cbankroll\u201d himself onto the debate stage.\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke sent out a fundraising appeal on Oct. 7 also criticizing Steyer for \u201cbuying his way\u201d onto the stage and asked his own supporters to donate.\n\n\u201cTom Steyer is a billionaire hedge fund manager who already spent a staggering $17.6 million on TV ads trying to qualify for the debates. Now, he\u2019s succeeded in buying his way up there. Beto needs to raise a lot of money to qualify for the debates too,\u201d the email stated, before asking for \u201cgrassroots donations\u201d\n\nSteyer's campaign shrugs off the attacks from other candidates.\n\nSteyer campaign press secretary Alberto Lammers told USA TODAY, \"Candidates need to do what they need to do.\"\n\nIf anything, the attacks \"elevate Tom's name,\" Lammers explained. \"We see it as kind of beneficial to us.\"\n\nMore: Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide\n\nAs for the campaign's own fundraising, Steyer's campaign says they have raised more than $2 million in the third quarter, with about 166,000 donors and an average of $12 a donor.\n\nSteyer has been willing to commit his own considerable resources to the race, though signaling his staying power.\n\nWhen Steyer announced his campaign, The New York Times reported he was prepared to spend up to $100 million in the race \u2014 a large proportion of which would come from Steyer himself.\n\nSince then, Steyer\u2019s campaign has poured money into ads. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Steyer spent more than $7 million on social media and TV ads within the first month of the start of his campaign, dwarfing the spending by other candidates.\n\nAnd while he resigned his roles at NextGen and Need to Impeach, he has still continued to fund the groups.\n\nOn Oct. 3, Steyer\u2019s campaign announced he would be giving $2.7 million of his own funds to Need to Impeach as the group geared up to spend millions on ads targeting Republican members of Congress in competitive races in 2020.\n\nAsked whether the large amounts of money he spent on social media ads might make it difficult for him to challenge social media companies' power as president, Steyer replied that companies like Facebook provided a service to him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s like telling Teddy Roosevelt, \u2018how can you take on the railroads if you ride the railroad,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nCLOSE The 2020 election is nearing and with that, comes the caucuses and primary elections. But what\u2019s the difference? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nHis chances?\n\nSteyer will be around through at least the November Democratic debate. His campaign qualified for it at the beginning of October by meeting the Democratic National Committee\u2019s polling thresholds in early states as well as the donor threshold.\n\nAlthough he trends towards the bottom of the field in national polls, Steyer polls well in early states.\n\nMore: Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in recent Democratic presidential primary polls\n\nIn the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, Steyer sits at about 0.8%, among the lowest-polling of the field. But in a Morning Consult poll of the early primary states of Nevada, Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, Steyer ranks fourth among the Democratic field, at 8%.\n\nWhether the early state polling is a consequence of his genuine appeal to the Democratic electorate or the result of bombarding voters with ads has yet to be seen.\n\nHow did Steyer manage to get to 4% in SC poll (and thus qualify for 10/15 debate?) My SC resident mom sent along one of many, many pieces of mail she\u2019s gotten from him over the last few weeks. Nothing from anyone else. pic.twitter.com/j6E8ILXlyi \u2014 amy walter (@amyewalter) October 7, 2019\n\nKyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said Steyer hadn't registered much in the race so far, though his high spending might have helped him qualify for the debates.\n\n\"Unlike on the Republican side in 2016, where voters clearly were clamoring for outsider, non-politician candidates like Donald Trump, Democrats seem more comfortable with established politicians and seem satisfied with the top choices right now (Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren at the moment),\" Kondik wrote in an email. \"So Steyer is a significant longshot at this point, along with most of the other candidates. We\u2019ll see if the debate does anything for him, but it\u2019s going to be hard for anyone to stand out on a 12-person stage.\"\n\nRegardless, Hargreaves describes Steyer\u2019s decision making as being driven by the desire to make the \u201cbiggest impact.\u201d\n\nAnd at least for now, to Steyer, that impact would be removing Trump from office by beating him in 2020.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/12/democratic-debate-tom-steyer-has-pushed-impeachment-and-debate-first-time/3915210002/", "description": "With House Democrats' impeachment inquiry rapidly escalating, Steyer finds himself\u00a0making his first debate appearance while\u00a0one of his signature issues is finally dominating headlines.", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Published A.M.
