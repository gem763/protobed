On Wednesday morning, one of the great soccer stories of recent memory broke, and it was all centered on Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy.\n\nThis story has everything: A mystery, an investigation, a surprise twist, a denial. It's got it all. It just about broke the Soccer Internet on Wednesday morning.\n\nSo let's go and get to the bottom of it.\n\nWho is this now?\n\nThis story centers on two people: Coleen Rooney, who is the wife of D.C. United attacker and England legend, Wayne Rooney, and Rebekah Vardy, the wife of Jamie Vardy, who is a striker for Leicester City and has played with Rooney on the England national team.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nSo, Coleen Rooney had noticed that details of her personal life had ended up in an English tabloid newspaper, The Sun. She also noticed that the details would only have been known to people who had access to her private Instagram account, which was a limited group of people.\n\nSo she decided to do something about it.\n\nThis sounds exciting.\n\nYou have no idea. Rooney had a hunch that it was Vardy, she says, so over the course of several months she posted fake stories to her private Instagram account. These stories included one about her home's basement flooding, and another one about going to Mexico to do a gender selection procedure. They were all fake.\n\nBut she set her Instagram Story settings so that only Vardy could see it.\n\nNo.\n\nYes.\n\nWow.\n\nYes, so those stories ended up in The Sun, and Rooney now had proof it was Vardy. Or proof to her, anyway.\n\nHow do we know about all this?\n\nBecause Rooney posted the whole amazing saga to her Twitter account.\n\nThis has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it...... pic.twitter.com/0YqJAoXuK1 \u2014 Coleen Rooney (@ColeenRoo) October 9, 2019\n\nWhat is Vardy saying?\n\nRebekah Vardy posted a response, claiming that other people have access to her social media accounts, and it wasn't her, basically.\n\nHow have Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy reacted to this?\n\nNo word yet, but a world sits \u2026 and waits.\n\nAre people making jokes about this?\n\nMore jokes than you would ever imagine.", "description": "The wife of Wayne Rooney ran a months-long investigation to find out who was leaking private stories to a tabloid.
