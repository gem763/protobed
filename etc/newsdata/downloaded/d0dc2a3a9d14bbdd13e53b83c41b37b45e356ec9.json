But the software on their screens \u2014 made by Cogito, an A.I. company in Boston \u2014 has become a kind of adjunct manager, always watching them. At the end of every call, Mr. Sprouls\u2019s Cogito notifications are tallied and added to a statistics dashboard that his supervisor can view. If he hides the Cogito window by minimizing it, the program notifies his supervisor.\n\nCogito is one of several A.I. programs used in call centers and other workplaces. The goal, according to Joshua Feast, Cogito\u2019s chief executive, is to make workers more effective by giving them real-time feedback.\n\n\u201cThere is variability in human performance,\u201d Mr. Feast said. \u201cWe can infer from the way people are speaking with each other whether things are going well or not.\u201d\n\nThe goal of automation has always been efficiency, but in this new kind of workplace, A.I. sees humanity itself as the thing to be optimized. Amazon uses complex algorithms to track worker productivity in its fulfillment centers, and can automatically generate the paperwork to fire workers who don\u2019t meet their targets, as The Verge uncovered this year. (Amazon has disputed that it fires workers without human input, saying that managers can intervene in the process.) IBM has used Watson, its A.I. platform, during employee reviews to predict future performance and claims it has a 96 percent accuracy rate.", "description": "The goal of automation has always been efficiency.
