REUTERS/Todd Korol/File Photo\n\nChina, angry at Canada\u2019s detention of a top Huawei Technologies Co Ltd executive last year on a U.S. arrest warrant, blocked all imports of canola seed in March on the grounds they contained pests.\n\n\u201cWe have continuously been engaging with China at multiple levels. The issue is that we\u2019re not seeing progress fast enough and as we would with any trading partner, this is the next step,\u201d Carr spokesman Michael Jones said.\n\nCarr said in a statement that Ottawa was seeking bilateral consultations with China at the WTO. Under WTO rules, Canada and China should meet within 30 days, and if these talks fail, Canada can request adjudication by a panel.\n\nThe WTO timeline means there is slim chance of a resolution before Canadians vote in a federal election on Oct 21.\n\nPolls show Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals face a tough fight against the opposition Conservatives. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who has strong political support from Canada\u2019s agriculture community, has attacked the prime minister for being weak in his dealings with China.\n\n\u201cI told Trudeau to take China to the WTO immediately. He had to think about it for over 120 days,\u201d Scheer said on Friday, citing an April statement in which he called on Trudeau to launch a formal WTO complaint against China.\n\nIn 2018, Canada exported C$2.7 billion ($2.1 billion) worth of canola seed to China, a market that accounted for approximately 40% of all Canadian canola exports.\n\nCanadian canola stockpiles surged to an all-time high this summer amid slumping sales to China.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that this action needed to be taken, but it is a necessary step,\u201d said Jim Everson, president of the Canola Council of Canada.\n\nIn May, Ottawa extended a federal loan program to offer more financial assistance to canola seed farmers. China has also blocked imports of Canadian pork and beef.\n\nJohn Guelly, chairman of the Alberta Canola Producers Commission, said the WTO move was \u201cdefinitely something we\u2019ve been asking for some time\u201d.\n\nNormally at this time of year, Guelly has sold up to one-third of his new harvest through contracts for forward delivery. This year, he has sold none of it.\n\nCarr made his announcement a day after Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said both Canada and China had formally approved each other\u2019s choice of new ambassadors.\n\nChina, which insists Ottawa release the Huawei executive, has also arrested two Canadian men and charged them with spying.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Ottawa had no immediate comment.", "description": "Canada, locked in a major dispute with Beijing, is taking the first formal step at the World Trade Organization to challenge China's decision to block Canadian canola exports, Trade Minister Jim Carr said on Friday.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427004542&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851P4-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
