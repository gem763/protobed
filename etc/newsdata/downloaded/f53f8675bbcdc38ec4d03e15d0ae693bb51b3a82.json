Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.\u201d\n\nEven as the FDA clarifies that \u201cno illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem,\" it\u2019s yet to be established whether the same MDH products have been distributed in India. Previously, the FDA has detained the imports of MDH spices for being on the Red List of salmonella detection alert. But for now, the FDA has asked those who\u2019ve already bought it to bring them back to the stores. \u201cConsumers who have purchased the MDH SAMBAR MASALA, 3.5 oz (100g) are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund,\u201d it said.\n\nFollow Vice India on Twitter , Instagram and Facebook.", "description": "MDH, a household name in Indian cooking, is recalling its products from retail stores in California for contamination that can cause diarrhoea, cramps, and fever within days of consuming it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d79f9cbeff011000807f77a/lede/1568275347540-garam-masala-3428150_1920.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.9712xh;0xw,0.0288xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
