The northern Italian resort where they held their summer training camp was in many ways the polar opposite of wet, autumnal Tokyo: scorching sunny days, pleasant warm evenings, a relaxed atmosphere and idyllic bike rides into the countryside.\n\nThen again, maybe not. If you were to sweep the memories of England\u2019s players now, their overriding impressions of Treviso will be of discomfort: double training sessions at higher than match intensity in cloying heat, with the mercury hitting 35C, the humidity at 85 per cent, and the mosquitos feasting on virginal English flesh. \u201cAbsolute hell,\u201d is how Joe Marler described it at the time. But Treviso was also where this side was forged: beasted and brutalised, held to the fire, girded for the rigours of games like these.\n\nThis is what it was all for, then: all these long months away from home, all those awful sprint training sessions, all those hours hoisting and hauling massive carpets across the field, every press-up you had to do with a team-mate sitting on your back. This was what kept you going: a World Cup semi-final against the greatest side in history, 80 minutes that will grip nations and define careers. This is the vision that sustained you when first picked up a rugby ball and started flinging it around. This is why you play the game.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s a semi-final that feels like a final, both in its heft and its mystique. These are the two best teams left in the tournament, teams who have played each other just once in five years, the sort of game that World Cups are for. It\u2019s a clash of opposites: northern hemisphere against southern, All Black against all-white, pure oozing pedigree against pure, breathing potential. Evidently, New Zealand start as favourites. Equally evidently, until Nigel Owens peeps on his whistle and brings up the curtain, nobody can be remotely certain.\n\nIt has felt like an interminable week. A match that needed no salesmanship has had plenty of it nonetheless: a phoney war being played out not just on tactics boards and in team meetings but on the airwaves, stoked by a thirsty media with hours and pages to fill, and with the eager connivance of two coaches at the very top of their game. For Steve Hansen and Eddie Jones, you get the sense that this is the part they most enjoy. For the players, muzzled and shackled, you get the sense that this is the part they most despise.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rugby World Cup semi-final: England vs New Zealand predicted team 1/24 England vs New Zealand Here's the team Eddie Jones should select for the Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand.

Mako Vunipola After coming through his first start in five months last weekend with flying colours, Eddie Jones knows he has one of his genuine world class players to call upon from the start. Vunipola completely changes the way that England\u2019s pack are able to impose themselves on the opposition, which enables the likes of Billy Vunipola and Manu Tuilagi to reap the benefits.

Kyle Sinckler His excellent display against Australia felt like a breakout performance that will have filled him with confidence ahead of what will be the biggest game of his career since the Lions tour. Sinckler is proving one of the gems in the pack that is proving his class by the minute. Getty Images, 5/24 4. Maro Itoje If New Zealand could have one player from the England side in their squad, it would be Itoje. The dynamic forward has been one of England\u2019s most consistent performers in Japan and has led their turnover charts, proving what a thorn he is in the backside of opponents. AFP via Getty Images 6/24 5. George Kruis He has swapped places with Courtney Lawes throughout the tournament and I\u2019d expect no different for this occasion, given the emphasis that Eddie Jones has put on the lineout. Kruis also brings extra bulk in the carrying department. Getty Images 7/24 6. Tom Curry Man of the match against Australia at the age of 21, Curry now has a target on his back that the Kiwis will have spotted. His place could have been at risk in order to play Courtney Lawes to strengthen the lineout, but breaking up the \u2018Undercurry\u2019 duo would be a travesty. Getty Images, 8/24 7. Sam Underhill The second part of England\u2019s dynamic flank duo, Underhill has proven worth his weight in gold in Japan, having formed a back-row of the likes that England have never seen before. Getty Images, 9/24 8. Billy Vunipola With fitness concerns and burnout fears done and dusted, Vunipola is the easy choice at No 8. AFP via Getty Images 10/24 9. Ben Youngs One of the survivors of the victorious 2012 team, Youngs has had a good World Cup up until now, but he will need to be at his very best to outshine opposite number Aaron Smith. AFP via Getty Images 11/24 10. George Ford A surprise choice, but one that makes sense. New Zealand lack a big ball-carrier in the centre unless they select Sonny Bill Williams, which given how Steve Hansen has gone this tour looks unlikely. In which case, England need the creativity that Ford and Farrell bring together. AFP via Getty Images 12/24 11. Jonny May There\u2019s a big concern over his hamstring, but if\u2019s he\u2019s close to fully fit May is worth the gamble. He proved his lethal finishing ability against the Wallabies, and the All Blacks know what he can do given his famous try at Twickenham in 2014. Getty 13/24 12. Owen Farrell The move to inside centre would be a surprise, but Farrell appeared to regain his confidence last weekend as displayed by his 100 per cent kicking ability. His appearance in this week\u2019s press conference said as much, and it\u2019s worth remembering that he and Ford know what to do together. Getty Images, 14/24 13. Manu Tuilagi Can he rekindle the 2012 Manu Tuilagi that blew New Zealand away? His recent form suggests he could well do so, and New Zealand know they need to hatch a plan to contain him when he\u2019s given the space out wide. Getty Images, 15/24 14. Anthony Watson The wing utilised his footwork supremely well against Australia, and having been faced with the powerhouse that was Marika Koroibete last week, George Bridge should be a welcome release.

Jack Nowell Getty Images\n\nAccording to his brother Beauden, with whom he has been sharing a hotel room, Scott Barrett is already so engrossed in the contest that he has been calling out lineout codes in his sleep. The middle of the five Barrett brothers, three of whom are in the matchday 23, Scott\u2019s selection at blindside over Sam Cane has been the main source of intrigue in the build-up, and offers an insight into where Hansen believes England are vulnerable.\n\nThe consensus is that Scott has been chosen as a fourth lineout option, an attempt to dominate an area of traditional English strength, one that was successfully disrupted during New Zealand\u2019s 16-15 win at Twickenham last November. There\u2019s an element of truth to that, but perhaps there\u2019s more to it too. For all his ability in the air, Scott is also superior to Cane with ball in hand, and from 1 to 15 the All Blacks have the look of a side prepared to pick and carry, to pass and offload, to punch and stampede for as long as it takes until a hole appears.\n\nAt which point, enter Beauden. The world\u2019s greatest rugby union player is adept at creating holes as he is at exploiting them, and if England allow him more than a few yards on the ball you can guarantee they will spend much of the evening turning on their heels. Beauden\u2019s counter-attacking ability in back field is another reason why England\u2019s kicking game will have to be immaculate, their chase co-ordinated and ruthless.\n\nMeanwhile, England\u2019s own reconditioned No 15 will face the sternest test of his career to date. Everyone knows what Elliot Daly can do in attack, but it is his defensive work that will be under the microscope here. It is one of the few certainties in his game that New Zealand will look to test him with plenty of high balls, look to isolate him in one-on-one situations, much as Australia\u2019s Marika Koroibete did in scoring Australia\u2019s only try in Oita last weekend. But Jones\u2019s faith in his full-back is total, a calculated gamble whose success depends on his 14 team-mates giving him a viable platform.\n\nBack in Treviso, Jones would hold full 15-a-side training games, in which any player who strayed offside would be issued with a yellow card, despatched to the corner of the field and flogged with press-ups and shuttle runs. It was a harsh punishment that achieved two aims: firstly it enforced a ruthless intolerance of indiscipline that has seen dramatically reduced England\u2019s penalty count, and secondly it provided valuable experience of playing 14 v 15, which in an atmosphere as febrile and high-pitched as a World Cup semi-final could very conceivably come to pass\n\nSo you\u2019ve got through the first hour and you\u2019re still in the game. What then? Jones believes the final quarter will be the most pivotal period, a truism that nonetheless serves as an acknowledgement of how the All Blacks can finish you off in the last 20 minutes. Cane will doubtless make his bow at this point to enforce order at the breakdown, and with the likes of Sonny Bill Williams and TJ Perenara lurking on the sidelines, New Zealand have the bench to turn the game any which way.\n\nEngland\u2019s bench, by contrast, looks better suited to containment. Marler and Dan Cole could wreak havoc on a tired scrum, but if England are forced to chase the game in the closing stages, you sense they will need something very special indeed. Tired, risk-taking oppositions are where this New Zealand side eat and drink, and there is no side in the game more adept at punishing lapses and running up the score in brazen, insouciant bursts.\n\nOften it\u2019s said that the opening exchanges hold the key to the game. Here, England will need to be at their peak from first minute until last. That level of intensity, the minuscule margins for error, their relative inexperience in these sorts of games and New Zealand\u2019s formidable strength in depth is why only an arch-optimist would dare to back them on Saturday. Either way, this should be a feast to savour: an encounter that will stimulate and stir the imagination until its very last second.", "description": "Did England\u2019s players look out of their Tokyo hotel windows on Friday morning, see the rain gusting in off the bay in great, monochrome sheets, and dream of Treviso?
