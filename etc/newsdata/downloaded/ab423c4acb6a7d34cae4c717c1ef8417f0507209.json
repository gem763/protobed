We take lessons from those games and we need to be a lot better than what we were.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Ready to rumble\u2019 \u2013\n\nCross-code star Sonny Bill Williams will start on the bench and fellow centre Ryan Crotty misses out altogether as coach Steve Hansen named in-form Anton Lienert-Brown and Jack Goodhue in midfield. Two-time World Rugby player of the year Beauden Barrett starts at full-back.\n\n\u201cIreland are in a situation where they haven\u2019t gone past the quarter-final. They know what it\u2019s like to go home so they\u2019ll try their darndest not to and we\u2019ll be the same,\u201d said Hansen.\n\nSchmidt admitted that Hansen and his backroom staff were \u201cgood guys to have a drink with afterwards\u201d, but stressed there would be little conviviality in the lead-up to what he said would be a challenging game for the Irish.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly not going to sneak up on them anymore, we\u2019re not going to surprise them. They are well aware of how we play and what they are going to do to combat that,\u201d said the Kiwi who, like Hansen, will step down after the World Cup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve no doubt they\u2019ve got a few things cooked up that we haven\u2019t seen before that we\u2019re going to find really challenging.\u201d\n\nSchmidt drafted in Robbie Henshaw to replace Bundee Aki, banned for three matches for a high tackle in their final pool game against Samoa, at inside centre.\n\nVeteran Rory Best will skipper the team from hooker, with the experienced duo of Conor Murray and World Player of the Year Johnny Sexton named at half-back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a reasonably good spot,\u201d said Best. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s all about Saturday \u2014 it\u2019s all about which team can turn up and implement their game plan best and deal with the pressure of knockout rugby.\u201d\n\nHansen echoed Best\u2019s words, saying he had primed his All Blacks team to be \u201cexcited, full of energy and ready to rumble\u201d as they seek a third consecutive title.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Defending world champions New Zealand are ready to conquer their quarter-final nerves and seize the slightest opportunity when they", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/5d3185_new-zealand-captain-kieran-read-is-aware-threat-posed-by-ireland-nerves-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
