An approach from Saudi Arabia was disregarded in early 2019.\n\nUnited are currently 12th in the Premier League, having lost 1-0 to Newcastle United in their most recent fixture before the current international break.", "description": "Kevin is one of six Glazer siblings to own a stake in Manchester United, having inherited their combined 90% stake after their father Malcolm, who bought the club 14 years ago, passed away.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/23/19714626-0-image-a-33_1571093626466.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
