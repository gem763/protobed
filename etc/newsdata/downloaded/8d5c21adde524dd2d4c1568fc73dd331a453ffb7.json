Locaria, a Venable lawyer who signed the complaint letter, declined to disclose the name of his client.\n\nA phone message left for Robert Trump through Trump Management, where he is a senior executive, was not returned.\n\nCertiPath\u2019s president and founder, Jeff Nigriny, said in a statement that Robert Trump \u201cis one investor in an entity which holds a minority interest in Certipath\u201d and that \u201che is exclusively a passive investor, has no management role whatsoever, is not an officer or director, and his name has never been used or mentioned by Certipath in any solicitation for a government contract, whether state or federal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNigriny said that the company is unaware of the complaint filed with the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general.\n\nThe company specializes in digital security and verifying online identities.\n\n\u201cCertipath has never used the Trump name in any way, and to do so would be completely inconsistent with our business practices and ethics,\u201d Nigriny added.\n\nThough the contract has been awarded, no money has been paid out. That is because a second company, NMR Consulting, of Chantilly, Va., also filed a protest of the bid with the Government Accountability Office, on July 1.\n\nThat bid protest has led to a \u201cstop work order\u201d on the contract, said Drew Wade, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no money being spent with CertiPath until this issue is resolved,\u201d Wade said.\n\nWade added that the Marshals Service had no knowledge of the allegations that a member of the president\u2019s family has a financial interest in CertiPath or that a complaint has been made to the inspector general.\n\nAD\n\nThe NMR complaint is about a separate issue and \u201chas nothing to do with the president or his relationships,\u201d Wade said.\n\nNMR did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.\n\nThe Justice Department inspector general has not initiated a review of the matter, according to a public listing of that official\u2019s reviews regarding the Marshals Service. A spokeswoman for the inspector general declined to comment further.\n\nAD\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSince Trump took office, CertiPath has been paid more than $6 million in government contracts, federal data show.\n\nOnce regularly spotted in New York society circles, Robert Trump has spent his recent years largely out of the limelight.\n\nHe followed Donald Trump into the family real estate business in New York and held senior positions in the Trump Organization. In the 1980s, he served as an executive vice president at the company and was involved in the Trump Organization\u2019s casino operations in Atlantic City.\n\nAD\n\nOne recent book about Trump\u2019s litigious history cites an anecdote about Robert Trump enduring Donald Trump\u2019s wrath in a meeting with bankers from Bear Stearns about the Trump Taj Mahal casino.\n\nAD\n\nAfter Robert Trump made a comment that Donald Trump didn\u2019t like, \u201cTrump stood up and pointed his finger near Robert\u2019s face, angrily saying, \u2018You talk when I tell you to talk!\u2019 \u201d according to the book by James D. Zirin titled \u201cPlaintiff in Chief: A portrait of Donald Trump in 3500 lawsuits.\u201d\n\nRobert Trump has been a steady donor to Republican candidates and state committees over the years, his contributions including a $100,000 donation to the \u201cTrump Victory\u201d political action committee in 2016, according to Federal Election Commission data.\n\n\u201cI support Donald one thousand percent,\u201d he told the New York Post that year.\n\nAD\n\nRobert Trump, who reportedly lives in New York\u2019s Dutchess County, is the president of Trump Management, a company that is listed on President Trump\u2019s financial disclosure form.\n\nAD\n\nThrough this company, the two brothers appear to have a financial relationship: The company is 25 percent owned by the \u201cDonald J. Trump Revocable Trust,\u201d a trust fund of the president\u2019s assets from which Trump can withdraw money from at any time. The other 75 percent of Trump Management is owned by \u201cTrump Family Members,\u201d according to the president\u2019s financial disclosure form.\n\nRobert Trump has also invested in other companies outside of real estate; he is listed as a board member of ZeniMax Media, a video game maker based in Rockville, Md.\n\n\n\nRobert Trump\u2019s stake in CertiPath is through SHiRT LLC, an investment partnership including the younger Trump and CertiPath\u2019s chief executive, Shawn R. Hughes. On the CertiPath website, Hughes\u2019s biography mentions that he is the managing partner of SHiRT LLC. It does not indicate Robert Trump\u2019s percentage of ownership.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2013, CertiPath was acquired by two entities; one of them was SHiRT LLC, according to a CertiPath news release from October of that year.\n\nSince then, CertiPath has been paid at least $13 million in U.S. government contracts, according to an analysis of data from the Federal Procurement Data System.\n\nBut the contract announced on June 25 by CertiPath appears to be the company\u2019s biggest yet: a \u201chighly-coveted contract,\u201d as the company described it in its announcement at the time, to upgrade and manage \u201cphysical access control systems\u201d for the Marshals Service including at judges chambers, courtrooms, cellblocks and firing ranges.\n\n\u201cOur decade-long strategy is being validated,\u201d Nigriny said in a statement at the time.\n\nAD\n\nBut the award was quickly challenged by other bidders.\n\nLocaria, the Venable lawyer, said that he has made follow-up calls to the inspector general\u2019s office since he sent the letter in July but has yet to receive a response. He said his client\u2019s motivation was \u201cshining a light on whether this was appropriate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBeyond the potential conflict of interest, the complaint letter also alleges that on the basis of CertiPath\u2019s experience, the company should not have won the contract.\n\n\u201cCertiPath, which primarily provides information technology products related to digital identification, appears to lack the basic program management skills and experience required to provide the physical security\u201d for these Marshals Service needs, the letter says.\n\nNigriny disputed that assessment and said CertiPath\u2019s \u201ctechnical abilities and operational history are, in our opinion, more than adequate to perform under the contract in an exemplary manner.\u201d\n\nSteven Rich, Devlin Barrett, Alice Crites and David A.
