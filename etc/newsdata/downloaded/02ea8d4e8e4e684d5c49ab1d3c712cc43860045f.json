But Bollore, a former Ghosn prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who succeeded his absent boss as CEO in January, blocked the move.\n\n\"Thierry Bollore told me no one wanted to work with me ... and that I could not go to work at Nissan either,\" Deboeuf said in a farewell email to colleagues seen by Reuters.\n\nRenault declined to comment on Deboeuf's departure. Deboeuf did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSince FCA deal talks collapsed in June, Nissan has pressed Renault to cut its 43.4% stake in the Japanese carmaker as the price of its support for a revived FCA tie-up.\n\nRenault is refusing to consider cutting its holding below a 33% blocking minority, and no agreement is yet in sight, according to two people closely following Renault-Nissan talks on the future of the alliance.\n\nOne option being discussed is a smaller immediate stake cut and an agreed mechanism to deliver a deeper reduction in future, if key milestones are met, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nShares in Nissan, hit by a sales slump since Ghosn's exit, are trading 35% below their value before his Nov. 19 arrest. The stock rose 1.3% on Tuesday, with Renault advancing 1% on reports that the alliance talks were progressing.\n\nDeboeuf's move adds to a steady Renault brain-drain to PSA since 2013, when Tavares was hired to rescue the carmaker from near-bankruptcy.\n\nOther switchers from Renault include Yann Vincent, PSA's executive vice president for manufacturing, powertrain engineering chief Alain Raposo. Thierry Koskas joined PSA as sales chief in March, two months after Bollore ousted him from the same role at Renault.\n\nTavares, who preceded Bollore as Ghosn's No.2 at Renault, was pushed out after publicly voicing CEO ambitions. Under its Portuguese-born leader, PSA has set new profitability records while making swift headway on the integration of Opel, acquired from General Motors <GM.N> in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Gilles Guillaume and Laurence Frost, Editing by Richard Lough and Mark Potter)", "description": "A senior Renault-Nissan executive has quit the troubled carmaking alliance to join Peugeot maker PSA Group , blaming Renault boss Thierry Bollore for forcing his exit.
