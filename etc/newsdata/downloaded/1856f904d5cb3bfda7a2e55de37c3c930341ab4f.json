Cuomo Drops The N-Word During Live Radio Interview", "language": "en", "text": "Warning: Language and audio may offend some readers\n\nYikes. What is it with the Cuomo family and their misunderstandings of racial slurs?\n\nDemocratic Governor Andrew Cuomo accidentally said the n-word during a radio interview on Tuesday on a local NYC radio station while explaining racism against Italian Americans. Cuomo's brother and star CNN anchor recently came under hot water after he went ballistic on some kid for calling him Fredo. The TV host said that Fredo was the Italian equivalent of the n-word. But on Tuesday, Gov. Cuomo also stuck his foot in his mouth while defending his brother.\n\nApparently, he called the radio station to discuss Columbus Day and Indigenous People's Day. Here's what happened:\n\nvia New York Post: He quickly turned the discussion to a New York Times op-ed that ran Saturday about the treatment of Italian-Americans in the past \u2014 and said the entire N-word while talking about slurs once used against the Italian community. \u201cThey used an expression that Southern Italians were called, I believe they were saying Southern Italians, Sicilians \u2014 I\u2019m half Sicilian \u2014 were called, quote-unquote and pardon my language, but I\u2019m just quoting the Times: \u2018n\u2014r wops. N-word wops,\u2019 as a derogatory comment,\u201d Cuomo said, slowly and clearly saying the whole inflammatory epithet. \u201cWhen I said that \u2018wop\u2019 was a derogatory comment, that was when the Times Union told me, no, you should look in Wikipedia, \u2018wop\u2019 really meant a dandy,\u201d he told host Alan Chartock, laughing.\n\nHere's the actual audio:\n\n\n\n\n\nFolks let Gov. Cuomo know on Twitter how out of line his comments were:\n\nHe said it in the context of trying to yell at the New York Times for being unfair to him, referencing a term they used.\n\n\n\nSo the motivation behind the using of the word wasn\u2019t even defensible. It was just self serving, which is par for the course with Andrew Cuomo. https://t.co/h04g0G2NfQ \u2014 Emma Vigeland (@EmmaVigeland) October 15, 2019\n\nI just don't get it.\n\n\n\nWhy is it okay to use the derogatory word... https://t.co/ePc5mEEgKA \u2014 Joe Bruno (@Joebruno999) October 15, 2019\n\ni'm more surprised it's taken cuomo this long to slip up and say the n-word in public \u2014 Chaotic Goof (@mattRAZ) October 15, 2019\n\nI'm trying to imagine how this would play out if a Republican governor did this. He probably would have been forced out of office by sundown, right?", "description": ".10/15/2019 19:06:34PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/59/862dd0bf-31be-4756-a6bb-7ebe5ebeee7c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
