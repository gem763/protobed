In my new Music for a While, I have another Gershwin song: \u201cThey Can\u2019t Take That Away from Me.\u201d I mentioned it in a political post last week.\n\nThe new episode begins with Bach, arranged by Jean Guillou, the late organist (and played by him). \u201cJust under four minutes of pure joy,\u201d I call it. (Indeed, the title of the episode is \u201cPure Joy.\u201d) I also have a story or two and a couple of tributes. One is to Myron Bloom, a great French-horn player, who passed away this month. Another is to Christopher Rouse, a composer, who also passed away this month.\n\nHe wrote out a statement, to be released after his death.\n\nWithout music, my life would have had no meaning. It has not only informed my life or enriched my life; it has GIVEN me life and a reason for living. . . . My hope has been to do for my listeners what Beethoven and Berlioz and Bruckner and Ibert and all of those others did, and still do, for me. I\u2019ve wished to \u201cpay it forward\u201d by inviting listeners to call on me to enter their hearts and their lives and to allow me the honor of accompanying them on their road through life. If summoned, I will try to be of use: to sing you a song, to paint you a picture, to tell you a story. Perhaps we can take a journey together. . . .\n\nSo, a mix of music, personalities, and ideas. Again, that new episode is here.\n\nP.S. For a review of Friday night\u2019s New York Philharmonic concert, go here. That concert was actually an operatic double-bill: Erwartung (Schoenberg) and Bluebeard\u2019s Castle (Bart\u00f3k). Two one-acters, a walk (two walks) on the dark side.", "description": "A statement by the late composer Christopher Rouse, and other musical notes.", "authors": ["Jay Nordlinger", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jonah Goldberg", "Kevin D.
