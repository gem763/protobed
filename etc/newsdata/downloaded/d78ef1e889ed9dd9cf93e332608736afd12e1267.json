The power has to be kept on even in idle plants, and GM will need to continue paying businesses that provide it with parts, even if no cars are rolling off the assembly line.\n\nPricier rides: Why buying a new car is more expensive than ever\n\nCar seat trade-ins: Walmart's event underway through Sept. 30. What you need to know.\n\nStill pay your bills\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s keeping the utilities on,'' Dziczek says. \"They're paying their suppliers ... (and) if you're not using the plant and the equipment, it's not making you any money.''\n\nAnalysts with Credit Suisse said in an investors note that while \"the impact could potentially be nominal if the strike is resolved quickly,'' GM could suffer $50 million a day just in lost production because of the strike\n\nHowever, the company could save some cash because plants are not operating, and \"GM could potentially offset lost production once the strike ends,'' wrote the analysts, Dan Levy and Robert Moon.\n\nWhile inventory is currently strong, car shoppers could eventually take their business elsewhere if they can't get the vehicle model or color they prefer, says Harley Shaiken, a professor at U.C. Berkeley who specializes in the study of labor.\n\nCustomers walk away\n\n\"If you can't find the Chevy Silverado pickup in the color and options you want, you may not want to wait,'' says Shaiken. \"You may go to Toyota... The hot-selling, high-profit models, that's where (GM) wants to have the inventory.''\n\nUAW members go on strike: 46,000 GM autoworkers walk out\n\nUAW hopes they won't have to walk picket line for long: UAW hourly workers hope for short strike against GM as strike begins\n\nGM reported a financial uptick last year, with net revenue of $147 billion, and $8.1 billion in income.\n\nFiguring out the exact financial toll a strike can take on GM is complicated, says Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business who closely follows the auto industry.\n\n\"They\u2019re all wild estimates,'' he said of the varying figures. \"You\u2019d have to estimate how many sales they would have made. You have to estimate whether sales are merely deferred. ... Those numbers are very broad guesses.''\n\nWill it be a draw?\n\nBut if the strike goes on, there are a couple of certainties, Gordon says.\n\n\"It will have a big impact on GM's finances and it will also have a big impact on the strikers\u2019 finances,'' he says. \"Both sides are going to suffer. Think of two boxers punching each other..You can't knock labor out because you need to have your cars assembled. You don't want GM to go broke. At the end, you declare sort of a draw. And everybody has a broken nose.''\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: UAW strike: How much could it cost GM?", "description": "From customers who go elsewhere because they can't get the pickup they want, to the need to keep lights on, here's what the UAW strike could cost GM.", "authors": ["Charisse Jones", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tkLNx1BTKo8voUZu3IZHAw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_money_325/b9680bc0f9ef50986622e3d0744857b9", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
