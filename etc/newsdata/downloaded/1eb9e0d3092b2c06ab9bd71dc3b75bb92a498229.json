I get the confusion,\" Noah told Angela Yee and Charlamagne Tha God on radio show The Breakfast Club.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It's not like you can't use the word \u2013 you can use it, but don't be shocked when something happens to you.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Some people need to say to themselves, 'I grew up with hip hop. I may have identified with black culture. But I also understand that I'm not black or I have not lived the black experience. There's something that comes with that.' Whereas black people, we go... the one perk to the oppression is getting the N-word.

So, I don't get why people make it like it's [difficult],\"\n\nTo prevent the issue, Noah said rap artists should release versions of their songs with a different word in its place.\n\n\"They should just make like another version, like a non-black people version that everyone can rap along to [where] they find an alternative word.\"\n\nIn 2018, Kendrick Lamar called out a white fan for failing to censor herself when he invited her to sing one of his songs on stage.\n\nThe rapper was performing his song \u201cM.A.A.D City\u201d at Hangout Festival when the moment happened, halting the music after the fan rapped the racial slur three times.\n\nFollowing the moment, Lamar cut the woman off and permitted her to perform the song again, telling her: \u201cYou got to bleep one single word though.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair, Lamar explained why non-black people shouldn't use the word.\n\n\u201cLet me put it to you in its simplest form,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been on this earth for 30 years, and there have been so many things a Caucasian person said I couldn\u2019t do.
