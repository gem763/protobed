Under the proposal, the Federal Court could order power companies to sell off assets on the recommendation of the competition watchdog.\n\n\u201cThe government has long warned that energy companies must put their customers first,\u201d Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement earlier this week. \u201cThat is why the government is committed to passing our \u2018big stick\u2019 legislation.\u201d\n\nAustralia has struggled in recent years with spiraling power prices and regional grid instability as aging coal plants close and successive governments have fumbled a transition to renewable energy.\n\nA previous attempt to pass similar legislation failed amid opposition from business and energy groups, though the government is claiming a mandate after promoting it as policy during its successful re-election campaign in May. It\u2019s unclear whether the bill, which was reintroduced Wednesday, has enough support from rival lawmakers to pass parliament.\n\nBusiness groups have spoken out against the move saying it could deter investment and say the legislation is at odds with the conservative government\u2019s traditional reputation as a supporter of big business.\n\n\u201cWe need investment in new parts of the energy market,\u201d Jennifer Westacott, chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, saidin a radio interview on Tuesday. \u201cWe think it will deter it. We think it is a highly risky piece of legislation and we think it\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Liberal-National coalition has sought to intervene in the power market to drive down prices. Under rules in place since July 2017, the government can force producers to divert gas to the domestic market if there is a shortfall.", "description": "Australian Power Firms Face Breakup Threat Under \u2018Big Stick\u2019 Law", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic4d643a7951f667aecd13d5275ccbad47.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
