It also scored its most points against an FBS team this season.\n\nOutside linebacker Rayshad Jackson led the Rebel defense with nine tackles and a forced fumble, while linebacker Javin White's third-quarter interception led to a field goal.\n\nRunning back Ke'Shawn Vaughn led Vandy (1-5) with 193 yards from scrimmage.\n\nNear the end of a scoreless third quarter, White picked off Vanderbilt quarterback Riley Neal and returned it 44 yards to the Vanderbilt 11. That set up kicker Daniel Gutierrez's 29-yard field goal that gave UNLV a 27-10 lead with 14:56 left in the game.\n\nOn Vanderbilt's next possession, Jackson forced a Neal fumble, which wound up in the hands of defensive lineman Nate Neal. Running back Chad Magyar's 14-yard scoring run gave UNLV a 34-10 lead with 10:44 to play.\n\nRiley Neal started the game off on the right note, hitting Vaughn for 53 yards on the game's third play from scrimmage, ultimately leading to Vaughn's 4-yard touchdown run to make it 7-0.\n\nUNLV answered with running back Charles Williams's 5-yard run on its first possession to tie the game.\n\nThe Commodores turned it over on downs on the ensuing possession, failing to convert a fourth-and-1 at their 46, and the Rebels answered with a six-play, 20-yard drive culminating in Gutierrez's 44-yard field goal.\n\nAfter a missed field goal by Vanderbilt kicker Ryley Guay, UNLV quarterback Kenyon Oblad found wide receiver Randal Grimes behind cornerback B.J. Anderson for an easy 63-yard pitch-and-catch score.\n\nVanderbilt pulled within seven on Guay's 48-yard field goal on the next drive, but UNLV marched 79 yards in 11 plays, going up 24-10 when Oblad hit tight end Noah Bean with a 5-yard pass touchdown pass 3:39 before halftime.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Entering the game a 15 1/2-point underdog, UNLV rolled to past host Vanderbilt  34-10 in Nashville, Tenn., on Saturday afternoon, giving the Rebels their ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
