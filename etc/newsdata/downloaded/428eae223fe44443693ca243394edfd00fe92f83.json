The gang will be arrayed in order of current polling popularity, with former vice president Joe Biden\u2014who is guaranteed to remind you many times that he was President Obama\u2019s VP\u2014sandwiched between a pair of progressives: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. The other seven hopefuls are New Jersey Senator Cory Booker; South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg; California Senator Kamala Harris; entrepreneur Andrew Yang; former Texas Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke; and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. (Sorry, no Marianne Williamson to amuse you this time around.)\n\nHere are just some of the many things you might keep an eye out for:\n\nWill Warren and/or Sanders go after Biden? Will they bring up his vote on the Iraq War, his endorsement of the crime bill, his refusal to support Medicare for All? Or will they play nice?\n\nWill Biden continue to present as an uncharismatic stumble-bunny? Or will he rise to the occasion and offer a little fire in the belly?\n\nWill someone try to gain attention by launching an attack out of the blue, like Harris\u2019s ambush of Biden during the first round of debates? (It gave her a momentary lift in the polls, but that seems to have abated.)\n\nHow will the lower seven distinguish themselves? Will they spend most of their time attacking Trump? How much of the conversation will center around gun control? The situation at the border? The wall? Impeachment?\n\nOr will they ignore the president and spend the evening eviscerating each other?\n\nWhat surprise does Andrew Yang, the guy who has promised to give everyone $1,000 for life, have in store for us? His campaign announced that he has something \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d to reveal tonight. (Imagine how the fact that Yang qualified, while Representative Tulsi Gabbard, Mayor Bill DeBlasio, and the other non-qualifiers didn\u2019t make the grade, makes that bunch feel about life tonight.)\n\nAnd, since this may be the last chance hotel for at least some of the people on the podium tonight, what degree of look-at-me histrionics can we expect?\n\nWhich brings us to our last question: Will anyone dare defy the no-cussing rule? According to CNN: \u201cIn an email to campaigns obtained Tuesday by CNN, officials from the Democratic National Committee and ABC News\u2014the host network of the debate\u2014warned the candidates to refrain from swearing on the debate stage so as not to run afoul of Federal Communications Commission indecency rules. \u2018We will not be broadcasting on any delay, so there will be no opportunity to edit out foul language,\u2019 the note read. \u2018Candidates should therefore avoid cursing or expletives in accordance with federal law and FCC guidelines.\u2019\u201d Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to refrain from a little judicious cursing or choice expletives of your own, as you sit glued to the screen for three hours, watching what will be a slug-fest, a snore-fest, or something in between.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "Only 10 potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates qualified for tonight's debate.
