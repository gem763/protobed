'I paid for my wife and then moved to Kusadasi in my rented apartment,' Collier posted. He added that Julia 'used to be a bloke.'\n\nIt is thought Collier ran an estate agency in Kusadasi while Mrs Collier was a pianist, giving private lessons as well as performing at hotels and bars, including the resort's Korumar Hotel.\n\nAfter the killing a horrified woman friend of the couple said: 'Julia was just the nicest girl you could ever meet.'\n\nNews of Collier's death has stunned the community in Cheddleton where he was a well-known and popular character.\n\nAfter his wife's murder, detectives probed the couple's relationship amid claims Collier paid for his bride on the internet and she had undergone a sex change (Julia Collier pictured)\n\nMike Worthington, who knew Collier through work, said: 'It's extremely sad, he was a very nice fun-loving person. I knew him a long time.\n\n'I had been out for a few meals with him in Leek and sadly he made the mistake of going to Turkey. I feel very saddened.\n\n'I'm sorry that I didn't take the chance of going to visit him. I wanted to see him but it's hard enough going to an English jail, let alone a Turkish one.\n\n'I don't know the full circumstances of how he was found guilty of killing his wife. But the man I knew wasn't like that all. He didn't have a care in the world and was lovely.\n\n'He was an entrepreneur and did very well for himself but things obviously went very wrong for him.\n\n'I would have liked to have seen him serve his sentence in an English prison really, because you hear all sorts of stories about these foreign prisons.\n\n'Forty-nine is no age. It's a tragic end to his life, firstly to be jailed in Turkey and then to die there.'\n\nKusadasi, Southern Aegean Coast in Turkey where Chris Collier lived with his glamorous bride Julia\n\nAt the time Collier was jailed another friend said: 'I don't think he is a strong enough character to serve that amount of time in a prison over there.'\n\nCollier was one of the first salesmen employed by tycoon Caudwell when he was building his mobile phone business, which he sold for a staggering \u00a31.46 billion in September 2006.\n\nSpeaking at the time of Collier's arrest, the day after Julia's death on November 27, 2010, Mr Caudwell said: 'Chris was one of my first salesman when I was starting out, so I remember him well. He was a good salesman and became a sales manager.\n\n'It is shocking to hear he has been arrested for murder. It's shocking to hear about any murder.'", "description": "Chris Collier died of sepsis after being diagnosed with pneumonia in a Turkish jail.
