He was told not to drive at night.'\n\nDeeney pleaded guilty to a charge of driving a car in a dangerous condition.\n\nHis lawyer Mark Haslam told the court in mitigation the footballer made the 'necessary changes within a short period of time' and the car, which had been bought with the windows already tinted, was now legally compliant.\n\nDetails of the model of Mercedes were not given in court, but he was fined \u00a3650, ordered to pay \u00a3150 in costs and was given a surcharge of \u00a365.\n\nHe attended the hearing but did not stay until the end, with a spokesman saying he had to rush off to a medical appointment.\n\nIt is not Deeney's first run-in with the law.
