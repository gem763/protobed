The device is fresh and spotless, and it has that \u201cnew phone\u201d scent. But as time goes by, your phone loses its luster: it just slows down.\n\nIf this scenario sounds more like your laptop, tap or click here for 7 monthly laptop maintenance tasks you should be doing .\n\nMaybe your phone is only dirty, lucky you. Tap or click here for 5 steps to clean your phone the right way .\n\nYou might blame the phone\u2019s aging circuitry, but the problem is usually much simpler than that. Apps, security issues, and battery use can have a profound impact on your phone, and a little maintenance can go a long way.\n\n1. Clean house\n\nYou probably have pages of apps and only use a handful. Time to purge.\n\nOn your iPhone, launch the Settings app, tap General, Storage, scroll and select the app you want to delete. Tap Delete App, and Delete again to confirm that you want to delete the app.\n\nTo delete apps from Androids, go to Settings, scroll, and tap Apps. A list of the apps on your phone will appear. Select the app you want to delete and tap Uninstall. Make sure to go back to your display window to remove the widget. If all else fails, Settings is the place to start when looking to delete apps. (Note that the steps in this post are for Samsung phones. Your exact steps may be different.)\n\nApps are only one way that advertisers track you through your smartphone. Watch this quick video to learn how to stop them.\n\n2. Don\u2019t believe the app hype\n\nContrary to what most believe, letting apps run in the background is not bad for Androids. If you are constantly opening and closing apps, you can hurt your phone\u2019s performance and battery life.\n\nApps on iPhones, on the other hand, don\u2019t truly keep running in the background. If you are multitasking, the app you\u2019ve stopped using will suspend itself, keeping its data in memory but not using resources.\n\nClosing apps and reopening them will drain your battery in the long run on an iPhone. If you want to use Background App Refresh, go to Settings, General, Background App Refresh and turn it on.\n\nRELATED: Change this one setting to save big money when traveling.\n\n3. More battery drain culprits\n\nYour settings can siphon battery life. Whether you have an iPhone or Android, turn off Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi when you\u2019re not using them. If you\u2019re in a place with no Wi-Fi, use Airplane Mode. Your phone will stop hunting for a signal, which really drains the battery. Another straightforward trick is to lower the brightness of your screen.\n\nTo lower the brightness on your iPhone, open the Settings app, and tap Display & Brightness. To turn off the GPS on your iPhone, tap on Settings, Privacy, Location Services and slide the toggle to off. To turn off Bluetooth, open the Settings app, scroll down and tap Bluetooth, then slide the toggle to off.\n\nFor turning off Wi-Fi, launch Settings, tap Wi-Fi and slide the toggle to off. There\u2019s also an easy way on iPhones to adjust your screen brightness or shut off your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi by accessing the phone\u2019s handy Control Center. There you can see icons for Screen Brightness, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.\n\nOn your Android, open Settings, tap Display and you can either turn on Auto Brightness or use the slider to adjust the brightness manually. To turn off Wi-Fi, go to Settings, tap on Connection, find Wi-Fi, and slide the toggle to off. On the same page, you can also turn off your Bluetooth and GPS.\n\nIf your Android supports this function, you can go to your home screen and swipe down to see the Status Bar. From there you can click off the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPS simply by tapping the appropriate icons. You can also adjust the brightness of your screen.\n\nRELATED: Can police make me unlock my smartphone?\n\n4. Stay up with the times\n\nWhen there\u2019s an update for your phone, install it. Makers are continually fixing performance and security issues.\n\nOn an iPhone, back up files you don\u2019t want to lose such as photos and videos. Next, tap Settings from your home screen, tap General, Software Update, Download and Install, enter Passcode if you are asked, tap Agree to the Terms and Conditions and Agree again to confirm.\n\nKnow that apps are not updated during an operating system update. You will have to go to each app to see if any updates are available.\n\nOn Android, tap About Phone and then Software Information. This step will tell you if you have the latest operating system. If you don\u2019t have the latest version, tap Settings, Software Updates, and Download Updates.\n\n5. To charge or not?\n\nFor iPhones and Androids, keep your phone charged between 40% and 80%. You want to restart your phone from time to time to give it a clean slate. And never let the battery overheat.\n\nNow, this is important. If you need to replace your charging cable, make sure it comes from the original manufacturer or a certified brand. Generic chargers may save you a few bucks, but they can also be extremely dangerous. Tap or click here to see if your charger could possibly cause a fire.\n\n6. Stay vigilant on security\n\nSmartphones can get viruses and malware. Here, an iPhone out-performs Android. Apple does not give its source code to developers, and consumers cannot easily modify the code on their own. That keeps hackers at bay.\n\nAndroids use open-source code that app developers can use, and hackers can misuse. If you own an Android and think you might have a virus, look for signs such as you\u2019re blasted with pop-up ads, your battery is draining too quickly, you see spikes in data usage, and unexpected apps appear on your phone.\n\nTo get rid of a bad Android app, put your phone into Safe Mode. This step disables third-party apps. The method for doing this may vary depending on your phone, but for most, it involves holding down the Power key and then tapping and holding Power off. Tap OK when prompted to reboot into Safe Mode.\n\nTo remove the offending app, open Settings, tap on Apps, go through your list of apps, and tap on Uninstall. You can then restart your phone to get out of Safe Mode.\n\nTap or click here for more advice if you suspect your phone is infected with malware.\n\n7. Clear things out\n\nDelete the cache from whatever browser you\u2019re using. On iPhone, tap Settings, find your browser and tap Clear History and Website Data.\n\nTo clear cache from third-party apps, tap Settings, General, iPhone storage and search through your apps. There may be a button to reset cache when you relaunch the app.\n\nOn Android, you can delete files by tapping on Settings, Storage, Free up space, pick a file to delete and check the empty box on the right. Then, tap Free Up at the bottom of the screen.\n\nBonus: 7 ways to hack-proof your smartphone to keep your data safe\n\nData breaches, ransomware, and phishing attacks are always in the headlines.
