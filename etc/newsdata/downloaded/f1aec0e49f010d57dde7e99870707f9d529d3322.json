Impeachment\u2019s gonna kill anyone who\u2019s not a senator or in the top five. We\u2019re fucked.\u201d\n\nThe likely difficulty for candidates from El Paso to Minneapolis isn\u2019t just an inability to break through in the saturated national media environment, though that is one concern. (\u201cIt\u2019s been the most nationalized race I\u2019ve ever seen, driven by nationalized media coverage,\u201d said Caplin, who also worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016.) Instead, it\u2019s the subsequent lack of cash that begets a long-term inability to build up infrastructure in early-voting states and to invest in paid advertising, which a consultant to a middle-tier campaign characterized as the \u201cone way you can break through right now,\u201d since ads aren\u2019t dependent on the news cycle. And that doesn\u2019t just determine whether candidates can make it to the next few debate stages, a necessary hurdle to long-term viability. In fact, \u201cthe choices that are going to be on the ballot in February and March are being set now,\u201d said yet another senior aide helping lead a campaign struggling to stay afloat. \u201cThe main thing that is determining whether you can participate in that ultimate campaign is finances.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Gabriel Debenedetti", "Nymag.Com Intelligencer"], "top_image": ""}
