We have been at the airport since 6pm last night and will be here until at least 10pm tonight.\n\n\"We are stuck in a little area near check-in. It has been a nightmare. None of us have slept. All they have given us is a cake and a cup of tea.\n\n\"Forty to 50 of us have been left with no hotel because there are no rooms on the island.\n\n\"The thing we are worried about is the weather is bad, we are not going to be able to take off again and stay another night at the airport.\"\n\nNicholas Mitchell, from Urmston, said disabled and elderly people have been left to sleep on the floors of the freezing cold airport.\n\n(Image: Nicholas Mitchell)\n\nThe 32-year-old said: \"I have been awake for 25 hours. I got to the airport 6pm for a 9pm flight back.\n\n\"We checked in but then the bad weather occurred. The plane got delayed by an hour and then another hour, it kept getting delayed.\n\n\"Ryanair also diverted, Ryanair had everyone in a hotel straight away.\n\n\"We got asked to wait outside the airport. We queued up for two hours, two flights worth of people one going to London one to Manchester.\n\n(Image: Nicholas Mitchell)\n\n\"We got to the front of the queue, they said they didn't have a hotel for us.\n\n\"They had only space for the elderly, children and disabled people, but they have left behind disabled and elderly people.\"\n\nHe added: \"They expected us to find our own hotels, it is now 9am in the morning and hotels don't check you in until 2pm.\n\n\"The flight has been re-scheduled to 9.50pm tonight. Which means we will have been awake for 36 hours and not put up in a hotel.\"\n\nJames Hampson, another stricken passenger, said: \" We are now 12 hours delayed in the airport. People are sleeping on the floors with damp towels because it is so cold.\n\n\"There is no accommodation for us. My wife has had to send airport staff to get her medication that she needs daily.\n\n\"Since we have been here we have had one bottle of water, a coffee and a bacon and cheese pasty.\n\n(Image: Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\n\"It has put a right miserable end to the holiday. We were on an all inclusive package holiday, why are we lying on the airport floor and not put up in a hotel?\n\nA spokesperson said: \u201cUnfortunately due to the adverse weather conditions last night in Corfu, flights LS952 to Manchester and LS1490 to London Stansted are being rescheduled.\n\n\u201cDespite our best efforts at the time, we were unable to source suitable accommodation for some customers at such short notice, however our teams have been working around the clock and have arranged day rooms for customers without accommodation.\n\n\u201cWe apologise to all affected customers for any inconvenience caused by these circumstances, which were beyond our control. We will ensure customers are on their way as soon as possible.\u201d", "description": "Only some were given hotels as around 50 were left stranded thanks to problems in Corfu Airport, Greece, on Friday", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Nicholas Mitchell", "Bloomberg Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20464848.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_AR_041019_Jet2-3JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
