(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nSports columnist\n\nIn Game 5 of the Washington Nationals\u2019 2016 National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Max Scherzer got Josh Reddick to fly out on his 98th pitch to protect a scant 1-0 lead. Scherzer had allowed four hits and two walks, working out of one bases-loaded jam.\n\nDusty Baker, then the manager, stuck with him for the seventh.\n\nWith the Nats hosting the wild-card game Tuesday night, this scene can\u2019t repeat itself.\n\nThe Nationals say they not only have Scherzer prepared to start against the Milwaukee Brewers, but Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin ready to back them up. The strategy, then, is simple: Use them.\n\nThis is not a game for Wander Suero. It is not a game for Fernando Rodney. This is a game in which your best available arms need to be used to somehow cobble together 27 outs, and there\u2019s no way Strasburg \u2014 on full rest \u2014 isn\u2019t among the Nats\u2019 best available arms.\n\nCould we see a game in which no traditional relievers appear, and it\u2019s some combination of Scherzer, Strasburg and Corbin?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to win Tuesday\u2019s game, because if you don\u2019t win Tuesday\u2019s game, there\u2019s no game Wednesday,\u201d General Manager Mike Rizzo said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we have to do to win tomorrow.\u201d\n\n[Nationals and Brewers enter NL wild-card game with different plans to get 27 outs]\n\nThat\u2019s a non-answer, which makes sense for Rizzo, given that he shouldn\u2019t reveal strategy to the Brewers. But it says here that if Scherzer is pushing through the Brewers\u2019 lineup for a third time, and the game is tight, there\u2019s no way he should be sent back out there to start a new inning. Give that inning to Strasburg. Or, if two of the three hitters due up are lefties, give it to Corbin, who, for some reason, was allowed to throw 94 pitches Saturday.\n\nI don\u2019t say this solely because of what happened to Scherzer and Baker in 2016, when Joc Pederson, a left-handed hitter, opened the top of the seventh with a solo shot to tie the score. It was Scherzer\u2019s last pitch, and the inning imploded from there. Remember who it imploded with? That would be Marc Rzepczynski to Blake Treinen to Sammy Solis to Shawn Kelley to Oliver Perez. By the end of the inning, the Nats were down 4-1.\n\nThe corresponding members of this Nationals bullpen \u2014 a bullpen that finished with a 5.68 ERA, worst in the National League and higher than any team since 2007 (except this year\u2019s Orioles) \u2014 can\u2019t be allowed to pitch against Milwaukee.\n\nNow, there are some tricks to this. Should Strasburg pitch, he needs proper time to get ready because he\u2019s not accustomed to warming up quickly, as relievers are. And you would prefer for him to start an inning rather than coming in with runners on base.\n\nBut Manager Dave Martinez said he has had the discussion with Strasburg.\n\n\u201cI brought Stephen into my office to talk to him and asked him if he\u2019d be willing to come out of the bullpen,\u201d Martinez said Monday. \u201cHis response was, \u2018I\u2019ve closed before \u2014 in college. I\u2019m ready to do whatever you ask me to do. Our motto all year is to go 1-0, and I\u2019m ready to go 1-0 on Tuesday.\u2019\u201d\n\nYeah, those relief appearances were a dozen years ago, when Strasburg was an 18-year-old freshman at San Diego State. Then, he saved seven games and struck out 47 hitters over 37 innings, all in relief.\n\nThose are nice tidbits. What\u2019s more important than Strasburg\u2019s experience is Strasburg\u2019s willingness. If that\u2019s as the Nats say it is, then he should pitch.\n\n[New York to new life: How a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight]\n\nThis isn\u2019t a casual decision, and there are considerations. Listen to first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, a 15-year veteran who knows not only the game, but the psyche of players.\n\n\u201cI think certain guys have certain jobs and they\u2019ve done it all year,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier said than done to ask someone to do something that they\u2019ve never done. \u2018Oh, just go out and get three outs in the big leagues against one of the better teams in one of the biggest moments, and it\u2019ll be exactly the same.\u2019\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, you have to be careful doing too much of that. I think people get carried away with it and just assuming we\u2019re not humans. If you\u2019re used to doing something, it\u2019s hard to do it in that situation.\u201d\n\nBut we\u2019re talking about Stephen Strasburg here.\n\n\u201cDo I think he could do it?\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d\n\nSo we have five acceptable names to pitch tonight: Scherzer, Strasburg, Corbin, Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson. The first three are the arms that made this postseason appearance possible. The last two are your best relievers who have righted themselves at the right time. Doolittle has worked through his midseason issues and has allowed just two runs and a .111 batting average in his last nine appearances. Hudson hasn\u2019t been scored upon in his last eight appearances, when opponents have a .194 on-base percentage against him.\n\nTo get 27 outs, that\u2019s the list.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll put together a game-time strategy,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cOf course, once the first pitch arrives, those plans go out the window. The manager\u2019s got to manage the game the way he sees fit.\u201d\n\nSure. Fine.\n\nDavey, don\u2019t treat this like it\u2019s Max in mid-July. Take Strasburg at his word. Back up what you said Monday: that Corbin\u2019s available, and use him if you need him. Treat it like Game 163 in your mentality, but not in your pitching strategy. Because if you do, there\u2019ll be no Game 164.", "description": "The best way to use Washington\u2019s unreliable relievers in a wild-card game?
