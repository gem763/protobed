(AP) - Officials say an African lion that died at the Rolling Hills Zoo in Salina suffered from encephalitis caused by a fungal infection.\n\nThe lion, called Sahar, died Sept. 27.\n\nZoo officials announced Thursday that a necropsy performed at Kansas State University found the infection caused lesions on the lion\u2019s brain and a lung. It said Sahar had no outward signs of illness until the day before his death. The fungus is not contagious.\n\nThe Salina Journal reports Sahar was born in January 2010 at the Bronx Zoo/ Wildlife Conservation Society. He was moved to the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago in 2012 along with 5-year-old litter mates, Kamali and Zalika. The three lions moved to the Salina zoo in June.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: KZBZ-FM.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Officials say an African lion that died at the Rolling Hills Zoo in Salina suffered from encephalitis caused by a fungal infection.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
