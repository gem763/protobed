But despite largely keeping those promises, Bevin now finds himself in a dogfight with Beshear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most recent poll of the race, from Gravis in June, gave Bevin just a six-point advantage over Beshear, 48 percent to 42 percent, with 10 percent of voters still undecided. According to data from Morning Consult, he is now the least popular governor in the country. At last count, just 32 percent of registered voters in Kentucky approved of his job as governor, compared with 56 percent who disapproved. All of which raises the question: What caused his political stock to plummet from its peak at the time of his comfortable victory four years ago?\n\nIn part, the answer has to do with Bevin\u2019s political brand. He ran in 2015 as an outsider willing to tackle politically thankless but necessary tasks, and that\u2019s how he\u2019s governed. He\u2019s attempted unpopular pension, education, and entitlement reforms; pushed right-to-work legislation; and tirelessly touted his efforts to make the state more business-friendly. On his watch, Kentucky\u2019s jobless rate has dropped to its lowest point in state history. He\u2019s even floated the idea of entirely eliminating the state income tax.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting in a profile in National Review earlier this summer, John J. Miller pointed out that \u201chis governorship has tested the viability of an agenda of labor-market and entitlement reforms.\u201d And indeed, despite the macroeconomic indicators that Bevin points to as evidence of his success, Ashley Spalding, an analyst with the left-leaning Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, suggested to the Louisville-based Courier-Journal this summer that the benefits of his reforms haven\u2019t necessarily been evenly distributed among the state\u2019s residents. \u201cUnemployment is certainly lower than it\u2019s been in a long time, and the job market continues to tighten in parts of the state,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Kentucky workers are not experiencing the kind of wage growth and improvement in standard of living that such an economy should afford.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, policy may be only part of the political equation in Bevin\u2019s case. His struggles could also be evidence that Republicans are still finding their footing in a state government that hasn\u2019t always been solidly red. Until Bevin\u2019s election in 2015, Democrats had held the gubernatorial mansion in Lexington for 16 of the previous 20 years, and the Democratic occupant just before Bevin\u2019s 2015 victory was Steve Beshear, the father of Andy, Bevin\u2019s challenger this time around. So while Andy Beshear was first elected to statewide office the same year as Bevin, in a race much closer than Bevin\u2019s, he comes into this campaign with the advantage of a surname well-known to the state\u2019s voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince assuming their posts four years ago, Bevin and Beshear have waged an intense partisan war of which their race for governor looks set to be the culmination.\n\nIn 2017, Bevin signed an executive order modifying the structure of state education boards and creating a council for managing charter schools, which had just opened in Kentucky for the first time thanks to a law he\u2019d signed earlier that year. Beshear then filed a lawsuit to block Bevin\u2019s order, asserting that the reordering of education boards exceeded the governor\u2019s authority. A judge ruled later that year that Bevin\u2019s modifications had been legal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis spring, Beshear again sued to block subpoenas issued by Bevin\u2019s administration in an effort to obtain the attendance records of teachers who used sick days to protest legislation at the Kentucky statehouse, resulting, according to local reports, in some Kentucky public schools\u2019 being closed on some days. In May, a federal judge refused Beshear\u2019s request to block the subpoenas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBevin has also expressed support for a proposal from Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos that would offer federal tax credits for state-based education scholarships. A bill to create a state tax-credit-scholarship program in Kentucky has not yet passed the legislature, but the governor has said he would sign it if it did.\n\nIn addition to education reform, health-care policy is likely to be a big factor in the race\u2019s outcome. A recent television ad backed by the Republican Governors Association slammed Beshear for his support of the Affordable Care Act and his opposition to Bevin\u2019s efforts to impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients.\n\nOne of Bevin\u2019s chief policy accomplishments so far is ending individual enrollment in the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange, a decision that was fairly popular at the time but might be becoming less so now. In a state with more than 1 million people enrolled in Medicaid, Bevin has staunchly opposed the ACA\u2019s expansion of the program even as it has become more popular, instead insisting on work requirements that would save the state $300 million over five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause governors have little to do with events in Washington, it isn\u2019t clear how big a role President Trump will play in the results of this contest: His agenda has little relevance to the state-centric policy debates that have dominated the race. But Bevin would likely prefer to have Trump\u2019s support nonetheless.\n\n\u201cYou want your governor to have a good relationship with the president no matter your political affiliation,\u201d Bevin said at a business summit over the summer. \u201cIt\u2019s good for you, your business, and Kentucky.\u201d\n\nOn the day of the GOP primary in May, Trump tweeted, \u201cTo the great people of Kentucky, please go out and vote for Matt Bevin today. Very important. He has done a fantastic job for you and America!\u201d In mid-August, he attended a fundraiser for Bevin, and later that month, his son, Donald Trump Jr., headlined a rally for the governor. The president\u2019s gloomy national approval ratings might make him seem like an unattractive campaign-trail partner at the moment, but he trounced Hillary Clinton in Kentucky in 2016, winning by 30 points and taking every county but two after claiming a narrow victory in the state\u2019s Republican primary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith or without Trump\u2019s support, though, Bevin has the advantage of incumbency and of being a Republican in a state that seems to be at the culmination of slow, decades-long shift from blue to red. Observers in Washington might hope to use the race to forecast Trump\u2019s 2020 fate, but if the governor can hang on to his seat in November, it will say much more about Kentucky\u2019s internal dynamics than about the fate of the national GOP.\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
