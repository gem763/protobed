Here\u2019s its how it\u2019s preparing for an 'inevitable' collapse.", "language": "en", "text": "Corporate profit margins have been on an unsustainable growth trajectory and are now poised to unwind, according to Rob Almeida, the global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management.\n\nIn a recent interview with Business Insider, he laid out why his colleagues have expressed this concern, and how he is investing for this eventuality in the portfolio he manages.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nRob Almeida is in constant communication with various portfolio managers from his perch as the global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management, which oversees $489.5 billion in assets.\n\nOne of the most common concerns they relay \u2014 and one he agrees with \u2014 is that corporate profit margins are unsustainable.\n\nAlmeida and his colleagues are leery of the disconnect between record-high profit margins on one hand and average revenue growth on the other. Gross domestic product growth has also lagged far behind the pace of profit-margin expansion \u2014 and it's a sign to them that something is wrong.\n\n\"Absent some sort of normalization upward in the economy, this has to come down,\" Almeida said of margins during a recent interview with Business Insider.\n\nThe firepower behind soaring margins has consisted of financial engineering tactics that companies use to improve their numbers, Almeida said. These include share buybacks, cost controls, leverage, and other things he calls \"non-core-business levers.\"\n\nFor example, companies have been able to simultaneously maximize margins and keep shareholders happy by keeping their costs in check.\n\n\"We generated above-average margins not by selling more and better dishwashers, but through cost optimization,\" Almeida said.\n\nThe heyday of such tactics is coming to an end, in his view.\n\nThat is because costs are rising, particularly the cost of labor as companies come under pressure to invest more in their employees.\n\nRead more: BlackRock's bond chief breaks down the best way for US investors to profit from the growing $17 trillion pile of negative-yielding debt\n\nAgainst this backdrop of rising costs, companies have the option of raising prices.\n\nBut that's not an easy proposition due to technology. It has lowered the barrier of entry for many business models and made mass production easier. It has also improved price discovery, such that customers can always purchase at the lowest price and sellers can easily undercut their competitors.\n\nCompanies could also make up for higher costs by selling more products. However, this move equally depends on the demand pull from consumers \u2014 and there's no guarantee of a resurgence on that end.\n\nPreparing for a profit slowdown\n\nWhile Almeida has clearly mapped out the road to lower profit margins, he is less certain about whether the reckoning will be an outright earnings recession. It could look more like a slog of slow earnings growth that jolts investors out of companies with the weakest value propositions and into those with the strongest.\n\n\"You've seen a lot of that incrementally this year, and I think that it picks up,\" Almeida said.\n\nIn addition to being the global investment strategist, he is lead portfolio manager of the MFS Diversified Income Fund. The fund has returned 10% and bested 96% of its peers over the past year, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWhat's worked includes shedding dividend-paying stocks and high-yield bonds, where he has an \"almost maximum underweight,\" and allocating capital instead to Real Estate Investment Trusts.\n\nREITS, Almeida said, have not pulled the same kind of financial levers that companies in other sectors have to maximize their profit margins. He also likes the sector because housing is an income-producing asset that is not as easy to duplicate as other consumer products.\n\nHis fund's top REIT holdings include AvalonBay Communities, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, and Simon Property Group.", "description": "There's evidence that something is wrong with profit margins, and MFS Investment Management is getting ready for a reckoning.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5231d23569bedd7d1d966704?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
