Massive vessels, interconnected by a multitude of corroded pipes that once carried chemical slurries, have rusted beyond repair.\n\nFive-year-old Saagar, pictured above in his mother Komal\u2019s arms, suffers from mental and physical disabilities and receives treatment at a rehabilitation centre supported by Bhopal Medical Appeal, which says it only treats families it believes have been affected by the Union Carbide gas leak 31 years ago. \u201cWhat is most pronounced is the number of children with birth defects,\" said Bhopal Medical Appeal activist Satinath Sarangi. \"Children are born with conditions such as twisted limbs, brain damage, musculoskeletal disorders.\u201d Sarangi admitted, however that there has been no long-term epidemiological research which conclusively proves that birth defects are directly related to the drinking of the contaminated water.\n\n100,000 people who were exposed to the gas continue to suffer today with sicknesses such as cancer, blindness, respiratory problems, immune and neurological disorders. While those directly affected, such as 64-year-old Zafar Ahmedas, pictured above, receive free medical health care, activists say authorities have failed to support those sick from drinking the contaminated water and a second generation of children born with birth defects.\n\nZubeida Bi and her husband Salim Rehman are pictured in an undated family photograph (top).

She says her husband died as a result of gas poisoning after the Bhopal disaster.\n\nLata Bai is seen with her husband Ashok Badgujjar and their four sons in an undated family photograph (top).
