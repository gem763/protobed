As well as starring in the performance, Tara has also written and produced \"God Sized Hole\", which previews at London\u2019s Etcetera Theatre from 2 pm on October 26th.\n\nWhilst keeping the plot a little covert and mysterious, Tara [VIDEO] briefly described what audiences can expect from this fascinating debut.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to say a whole lot about the show, because it takes a lot of twists and turns. It's a mystery that unfolds and reveals itself in the end but it's an important story to tell and the characters are people who are often stigmatised in today\u2019s society. Overall the concept is one of exploring how ordinary people can find grace and hope, whilst living alone and often feeling isolated.\n\n\"The main character, June, had big dreams, and she was on the way to making them happen when she got into a relationship that would change her life forever.\n\nClearly with the clue being in the title \u2026God Sized Hole\u2026 the story then follows the rise and fall of June\u2019s most profound relationship to date.\"\n\nHaving studied and worked on \"both sides of the pond\", Tara's fearless attitude in bringing her first solo play to London is something which she described as 'completely thrilling'. Not only does she have to conquer the complex challenges of wearing many hats, as an actress, writer and producer, but equally she has to develop the show using her own sense of improvisation and judgement.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!
