The FAST test is an easy way to recognise and remember the signs of stroke. FACE: Check their face. Has their mouth drooped? ARMS: Can they lift both arms? SPEECH: Is their speech slurred? Do they understand you? TIME: Time is critical. If you see any of these signs, call 000 straight away.\n\nThe mother - who's been documenting her battle via Instagram - said she was getting a glass of water for her four-year-old daughter Piper at dinner when the first signs of the symptoms struck.\n\n'I was thinking \"what the bloody hell is going on here?\",' she told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'I dropped and slumped over a chair as my right leg went numb and was unable to support me. I eventually dropped to the ground paralysed on my entire right side.'\n\n'My tongue wouldn't poke out, my speech was slurred and I was extremely disoriented and not making sense when I could manage to spit a word out.\n\n'I had a ringing in my head that wouldn't stop and sounded like a train putting on its breaks in my head. I thought I was going to die I cannot describe anything like this.'\n\nStruggling to move the right side of her body, the retailer worker experienced slurred speech, blurred vision, disorientation and ringing in the ears (pictured in hospital)\n\nThe doting mother - who's currently in hospital getting further treatment - said the most challenging part of her battle is not being with her two young daughters\n\nWhen Tahlia arrived at the hospital, she was still disoriented but despite her symptoms, she was sent home.\n\n'We told them I was having a stroke but the doctor kept arguing, saying I was too young for a stroke so he wouldn't investigate,' she said.\n\nI knew something more sinister had happened but due to my age, I was discriminated against being told \"no, it's not a stroke\"\n\n'After a few hours, I was sent home after being told I was too stressed and I needed a psychologist. I was super p***ed off as you can imagine.'\n\nTahlia - who goes to the gym between five to seven days a week - claimed the doctor refused to give her a CT scan because of her age.\n\n'I knew something more sinister had happened but due to my age, I was discriminated against being told \"no, it's not a stroke\",' she said.\n\n'The doctor refused to believe it was a stroke. Further problems could have been prevented if I was given immediate attention like needed.'\n\nWithin less than one hour after she was discharged from hospital, she suffered a second stroke, leaving her left side temporarily paralysed (pictured of her smile slightly drooped)\n\nWhat is a stroke? A stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel (artery) and interrupts blood flow to the brain region supplied by that artery, or when a blood vessel breaks and bleeding occurs into an area of the brain. The symptoms of stroke usually come on suddenly. Symptoms that may also occur in stroke are: Loss of vision in one eye, loss of vision in half the visual field of each eye, or double vision\n\nSudden onset of dizziness or loss of balance\n\nSudden severe headache with no known cause\n\nDrowsiness or loss of consciousness Stroke is the third most common cause of death in Australia and a leading cause of disability. About 55,000 Australians have strokes annually, 73 per cent of these being first-ever strokes.

When the second stroke hit I don't remember much of it but it went for around half hour,' she said.\n\n'All I do remember is crying, saying \"I'm going to die\". For several nights after, I wouldn't sleep as I thought I would have another stroke and die in my sleep.\n\n'Still now I have side effects and think it's all starting again.'\n\nThe mother said she was getting a glass of water for her four-year-old daughter Piper (left) at dinner when the first signs of the symptoms struck\n\nWhat are the effects of stroke? The most common problems in daily life are likely to be caused by: Weakness or lack of movement (paralysis) in legs and/or arms\n\nTrouble speaking, reading or writing\n\nChanges to the way things are felt when touched (sensory problems)\n\nProblems thinking or remembering (cognitive problems)\n\nChanges to way things are seen or felt (perceptual problems)\n\nShoulder pain\n\nTrouble swallowing\n\nIncontinence\n\nTiredness / fatigue\n\nTahlia said she now uses a walking frame because she feels weak on her left side.\n\n'I now use a walking frame because I'm weak on my left side, I have hearing issues, my fine motor skills are a struggle, I have seizures and I have nerve pain constantly. The list goes on,' she said.\n\n'My smile is slightly drooped, I constantly get blurry vision and loud ringing in my ears. My short term memory is horrendous, I forget the conversations I have just had or who I've spoken to.\n\n'But as traumatic as this was, I am lucky to have come out with only tiny parts of my brain dead... I have small struggles to overcome with physio and work with doctors.'\n\nTahlia said the cause of her stroke stems from a 'small hole' in her heart, which has been there since birth.\n\n'It's creating clots and shooting them to my brain, which led to the strokes. I am awaiting heart surgery to try fix the issues,' she said.\n\n'The hospital staff have been incredible. One nurse in particular helped me through the anxiety and sleepless evenings.'\n\nThe doting mother said the hardest part is not being 'hands on' with her two young daughters\n\nAs she remains in hospital, Tahlia said she 'hates' not being at home to see her little girls\n\nThe doting mother - who's currently in hospital getting further treatment - said the most challenging part of her battle is not being with her two daughters.\n\n'I am such an active hands on mother but after the stroke, I have been on a walking frame and I'm struggling to move,' she said.\n\nNever at 27 did I think I would have a stroke and if I hadn't gone with my own gut feeling and instincts I wouldn't of been treated\n\n'Not being able to live our normal life and be hands on is difficult. We have never been separated for this long. I am currently back in hospital on day five and hate not being there to kiss them goodnight and hug them good morning.'\n\nBy sharing her story, she wanted to warn young people about the tell-tale signs - and why you should 'never ever think a stroke is only for old people'.\n\n'I wanted to speak out so I can help save someone else's life,' she said.\n\n'Anyone of any age can get a stroke and doctors need to not discriminate when someone comes in with stroke symptoms.\n\n'Never at 27 did I think I would have a stroke and if I hadn't gone with my own gut feeling and instincts I wouldn't of been treated.'", "description": "Australian mother Tahlia Jade who suffered three terrifying strokes at the age of 27 despite being healthy has revealed how doctors  initially didn't believe her because she was too young.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/23/20059846-0-image-a-174_1571785085982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
