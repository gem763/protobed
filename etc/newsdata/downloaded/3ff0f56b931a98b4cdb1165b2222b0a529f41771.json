Or making a big show about trying to impeach Trump to appease the Liberal base.\n\nBecause that\u2019s what Collins points out, this is all really just a show and that the committee doesn\u2019t ever do anything but talk. And issue a bunch of subpoenas, apparently \u2026\n\nWatch.\n\nIn the absence of a proper floor vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, today\u2019s business represents a regular oversight hearing, masquerading as impeachment to appease a liberal base. pic.twitter.com/RfmPO2C4F6 \u2014 Rep.
