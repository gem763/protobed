If Johnson lost such a vote, and no other party leader could command majority support within 14 days for a new administration, an election would be triggered in 25 working days - later than the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s strategy is to win the election, renegotiate the Brexit deal and then hold a special conference to decide the party\u2019s position - either to leave the EU with a deal or to remain - in a second referendum.\n\nThe outcome of any second referendum remains difficult to predict as opinion polls have shown only minor fluctuations in voters\u2019 views on Brexit since the 2016 referendum. Much would hinge on turnout.\n\nAnother route to an election would be a simple majority vote by parliament for that option. If parliament were to back that option on Wednesday an election could be held as early as Oct. 31 - the day the government says Britain must leave the EU.\n\nAn election after Oct. 31 - assuming Britain remains in the EU - could undermine Johnson\u2019s chances of winning a parliamentary majority as many Brexit supporters would defect to the Brexit Party, splitting the Brexit vote.\n\n2) \u2018LOOPHOLE BREXIT\u2019\n\nJohnson\u2019s reaction to the court ruling on Wednesday was public defiance. He said he wanted to reach an exit deal with the EU but that the court had hindered his efforts, adding that the default situation was still for Brexit to occur on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cAs the law currently stands, the UK leaves the EU on October 31st come what may, but the exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWe should have an election,\u201d he said. Parliament has already twice defeated his demand for an election.\n\nA Downing Street source said he would not resign but would fly back to London later on Tuesday after giving a speech at the United Nations in New York. He had been due to leave New York on Wednesday. Johnson will hold a call with cabinet ministers later on Tuesday, the source said.\n\nJohnson said that opponents of Brexit were trying to thwart the will of the people. His chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has repeatedly said that the people should be trusted on Brexit.\n\nSome opponents fear Johnson has been working on finding a loophole to get around the legislation that parliament has passed forcing a delay unless he gets a deal.\n\nThat would move Brexit back to the courts, possibly just as the deadline looms. If he gets an election before Oct. 31, Johnson hopes the new intake of lawmakers would be more supportive of an aggressive Brexit strategy.\n\n3) BREXIT WITH A DEAL\n\nJohnson has repeatedly said he will try to get a deal at an EU summit on Oct. 17-18, though the EU has been much less positive on his chances.\n\nEU negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday cast doubt on the likelihood of a deal and reaffirmed that the bloc could not agree to London\u2019s demand to remove the Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d, a policy to prevent a return of border controls on the island of Ireland, without a serious alternative.\n\nIf he can win some changes to the Withdrawal Agreement - which was negotiated by his predecessor Theresa May and the EU and has already been voted down three times by parliament - this could prove enough to convince some opponents of the bill to finally back it or risk losing Brexit completely.", "description": "Britain's exit from the European Union was in disarray on Tuesday after the Supreme Court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had acted unlawfully by advising Queen Elizabeth to suspend parliament.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433397337&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1IU", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
