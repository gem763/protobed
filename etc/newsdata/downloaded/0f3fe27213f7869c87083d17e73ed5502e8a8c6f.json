Taylor detailed conversations with Trump administration officials pushing an explicit quid pro quo, in his view. He was told, \u2018everything that Ukraine wanted from the United States including military aid depending on the president publicly announcing an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden.\u2019 The White House has been relentlessly attacking Ambassador Taylor.\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe president then called Taylor a Never-Trumper, and there\u2019s no evidence for that. And he said that all Never-Trumpers, quote, are human scum. Human scum. Thousands of miles away, watching this all unfold, was one of Taylor\u2019s west point classmates with whom he served in Vietnam, now retired colonel Bob Seitz.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSeitz told me that Bill Taylor of Alpha Company is the embodiment of the military academy cadet prayer, \u2018make us to choose the harder right instead of, the easier wrong and never be content with a half-truth when the whole can be won.\u2019 Colonel Seitz told me he\u2019s been enraged, watching the president and his aides lie about his friend Bill Taylor.\u201d\n\nTapper concluded, \u201cPresident Trump can suggest that Taylor is \u2018human scum\u2019 and the folks in the White House can attempt to smear Bill Taylor but to his friends, the president isn\u2019t just attacking Bill Taylor, he\u2019s attacking the values that Taylor personifies: duty, honor, and country. General Eikenberry told me, \u2018Taylor\u2019s integrity and courage are the true marks of patriotism, loyal to an oath of office and never to be corrupted or intimidated by those seeking personal gain at our nation\u2019s expense.\u2019 You can ask yourself: of the behavior and values you have seen displayed during this impeachment inquiry, whose makes you proud to be an American and whose might make you ashamed?\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of CNN's \"State of the Union,\" host Jake Tapper commented on President Donald Trump criticizing Bill Taylor and his testimony to the House impeachment inquiry. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-1149299476-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
