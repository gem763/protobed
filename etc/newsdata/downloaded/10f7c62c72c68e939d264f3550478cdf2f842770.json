She is in an incubator.\"\n\n\"I went close and looked - and saw this wide open mouth. I fell into darkness - and lost consciousness.\n\n\"I was taken to intensive care where the doctors suggested I leave the baby in the hospital. But I strongly refused.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Yury, her husband, was recovering from a car crash in another hospital.\n\n\"His face did not change when he saw Darina,\" she said. He told his wife: \"She is ours, our girl.\"\n\n\"The truth is this trouble has only brought us together,\" she said.\n\n\"It is so horrible when you see a crippled and crying baby and you are unable to help.\n\n\"Darina was crying day and night, and I was crying too. I understood that she was in pain.\u201d", "description": "Darina Shpengler's dad says 'you are so beautiful' after a mammoth 11-hour operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital", "authors": ["Will Stewart", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "The Siberian Times"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20446087.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Darina-Shpengler_5_reunited_The-Siberian-Times.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
