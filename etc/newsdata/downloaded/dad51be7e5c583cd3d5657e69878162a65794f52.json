It should have been an easy win: Umbria has only ever been governed by either communists, the far left or the center left since Italy began holding regional elections nearly 50 years ago.\n\nYet as is the case across Italy, the wind here has changed in favor of the League. The most recent polls show the League-led right-wing coalition to be ahead by 4 percentage points.\n\n\"We're broke, there are no jobs. After [50] years of the left, it doesn't work,\" said Michele Proietti, a 61-year-old artist from Terni, an industrial city in southern Umbria, who was visiting Perugia for the chocolate festival.\n\n\u201cIf the center right wins here on October 27, it's a clear signal for the national government\u201d \u2014 Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's League party\n\nPreviously a supporter of the center-left Democratic Party (PD), he recently decided to vote for the League. \"The Democratic Party showed me that they have good ideas, but we have concrete problems and their ideas don't work,\" Proietti explained.\n\nThe center left has tried to shrug off the looming defeat in Umbria, but it's expected to have significant repercussions at a national level. For the PD, Sunday marks the first time they're running together in an election with the anti-establishment 5Star Movement after the two parties entered a national coalition in September.\n\nLosing one of Italy's last left-wing strongholds could spell trouble for the government's longevity \u2014 and, in turn, resuscitate the fortunes of Salvini's League.\n\nSalvini on the campaign trail\n\nMany PD voters in Umbria say they're unconvinced by both the new alliance in Rome and the center-left pick for regional president.\n\nThe 5Stars don't have much of a following in Umbria and the presidential candidate \u2014 Vincenzo Bianconi, a hotelier who supported a center-right candidate in this year's European election \u2014 isn't associated with the left. The previous regional president, the PD's Catiuscia Marini, had to resign over corruption allegations in the spring, triggering Sunday's election. (She denied any wrongdoing.)\n\nThe League, meanwhile, is on the rise. The far-right party was already the first party in almost every Umbrian municipality in the European election, and this summer's crisis \u2014 when Salvini pulled the plug on the League's coalition with the 5Stars \u2014 doesn't appear to have dented their appeal.\n\nAfter being ousted from government, Salvini has made it a priority to campaign in Umbria to demonstrate that, in power or not, he still commands considerable support.\n\n\"If the center right wins here on October 27, it's a clear signal for the national government ... which is why [center-left leaders] are saying it's a local election and it has nothing to do with the government's popularity,\" Salvini said last week, speaking at a rally in the Umbrian town of Spoleto.\n\nHe then paid a visit to Perugia's chocolate festival, where he posed for selfies with supporters and gingerly carved pieces of chocolate from a giant block with an axe, throwing the pieces to a crowd of spectators. He also took a dig at the government, which has recently proposed a sugar tax, saying: \u201cI hope chocolate isn\u2019t next.\u201d\n\nFor some Salvini supporters in Italy, it's a protest vote. Vincenzo Maranicci, a 55-year-old taxi driver who plans to vote for the League, said: \"The right are the old fascists, but now the parties are the same. It never changes here ... [Politicians] say they care, but many people are not happy. For change, we need a revolution.\"\n\nYet others say there has been a gradual change in Umbria, driven by wider dissatisfaction with the center left in the region.\n\nShifting toward the right\n\nMarco, 32, a history researcher from the town of Marsciano who did not give his surname, thinks the shift began a few years ago. He said that during the 2014-16 PD-led government of Matteo Renzi, center-left politics went from being associated with workers to the upper and middle classes, creating a fundamental shift.\n\n\"The most shocking fact,\" said Marco, \"is that the workers in Terni's steel factory all vote for Salvini.\"\n\nTerni is home to Italy's first steel factory, on which the local economy has long been heavily reliant. Yet the factory has hemorrhaged jobs since it was taken over by German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp in the late 1990s.\n\nCesare Filipponi, a former worker at the factory and longtime center-left voter, was unsure whether he would vote on Sunday, but echoed some of Salvini's rhetoric when describing the town's difficulties. \"We're all impoverished, no jobs, no future for our kids, you walk around Terni and all you see are immigrants,\" he said.\n\nWhile he was still undecided, Filipponi was certain that none of his former factory colleagues would vote for the center left, despite \"all being former Communist Party supporters and members of the unions.\"\n\nThe shift hasn't only occurred among factory workers, however, but among a wide range of groups dissatisfied with the current state of Italian politics and the economy. Unlike in the south, rising anti-establishment sentiment has never translated into votes for the 5Stars in Umbria.\n\nThe region's remaining left-wing voters are watching League's growing popularity in Umbria with dread.\n\n\u201cToo bad the chocolate festival ends on the day of the election. We'll have nothing to comfort ourselves with\u201d \u2014 Laura Miccioli, left-wing voter\n\nLaura Miccioli, from the town of Stroncone \u2014 where Salvini held a rally recently \u2014 said her family had only ever voted for left-wing parties, a tradition she planned to uphold despite some misgivings about the current direction of the PD.\n\n\"Seeing Salvini in town last weekend made me sick,\" she said, \"but I get why people vote for him, the PD's behavior both at a national and regional level has been so disappointing.\"\n\nMiccoli added: \"Too bad the chocolate festival ends on the day of the election. We'll have nothing to comfort ourselves with.\"", "description": "Umbria looks set to lose its status as a left-wing stronghold in Sunday\u2019s vote.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli", "Imogen Sudbery", "Jacopo Barigazzi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1168369871-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
