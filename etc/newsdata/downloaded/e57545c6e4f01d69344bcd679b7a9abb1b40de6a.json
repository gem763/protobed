The CVE stands for countering violent extremism.\n\nIt employs 40 people working in 15 languages, including English, French and Arabic, on 76 projects in 28 countries, with clients ranging from governments to technology firms.\n\nOne project is a collaboration with the Canadian government against jihadism and the far-right. Another works with the United Nations on online Islamist content in Asia.\n\nThe company has also had a partnership for several years with Google, using online advertising to target people looking up violent extremism on the net.\n\nThe Facebook contract involves Moonshot analysing how effective the social network could be to \u201cderadicalise\u201d users looking up extremist content.\n\nMoonshot is classed as a \u201csocial enterprise\u201d in that it reinvests most of its profits into the projects it develops and technology, guaranteeing independence.\n\nIt\u2019s known for having developed the \u201credirect method\u201d of finding individuals taken in by violent extremism then trying to make them change their ways.\n\nThat involves identifying people searching for such content online, finding out as much possible how they are doing it and what ideas they are looking for, before intervening.\n\nThat can even include direct contact, using social workers or mental health specialists who work in the \u201creal world\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Peace activists\u2019 \u2013\n\nJihadist online networks are known for being more difficult to infiltrate, and often use hard-to-access encrypted software such as the Telegram messaging app and other platforms.\n\nFar-right extremists and white supremacists on the other hand are often more inclined to air their views openly, which makes them easier to find, said Ramalingam.\n\n\u201cObviously, if we believe someone poses an imminent threat, that\u2019s where it\u2019s beyond our organisation,\u201d she added. \u201cOnly on rare occasions we\u2019ll engage with law enforcement on this.\u201d\n\nSince 2015, Moonshot has gathered huge amounts of data and experience, while Ramalingam says direct messages sent to users offering help have been particularly successful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with so many individuals that were deep in these sort of groups,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve now left and turned their life around and some of them have become peace activists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge transformation. To my mind change is always possible because I\u2019ve seen it with my own eyes. You have to have an optimistic view.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Vidhya Ramalingam believes it\u2019s always possible to change, even for people deeply involved in the murky online world of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/97bd0e_vidhya-ramalingam-co-founder-start-up-moonshot-cve-countering-violent-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
