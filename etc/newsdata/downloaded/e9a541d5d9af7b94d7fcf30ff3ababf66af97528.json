Most teams try to regain the kick directly.\n\nWhile retaining the kick would be first prize, a close second prize is catching the opponents in the wrong place and putting them under pressure, which often leads to a line-out for the best line-out in the competition (57 out of 57) in their own half.\n\nAgainst Wales, the Boks will run into sterner forwards than Japan, a team whose kicking game picked apart their rush defence last year because they have good kickers and chasers, and a defence forged in the image of defence coach Shaun Edwards, who looks an awful lot like the guy in charge of enforcing the no-touching rule at strip joints.\n\nIf there is a weakness in the Welsh team, it is the absence of injured number eight Josh Navidi, who was a pain in the backside at the break down in November last year and fullback Liam Williams\u2019 withdrawal with an ankle injury.\n\nThen there is the return of outside centre Jonathan Davies, who combines iron fist with velvet glove so seamlessly and is world class, but his return looks rushed, while Williams\u2019 replacement, the experienced Leigh Halfpenny, is less explosive than the man he is replacing in attack.\n\nOf course, the Boks are without their player of the tournament, winger Cheslin Kolbe, who will be replaced S\u2019bu Nkosi.\n\nPsychologically, the Welsh hold the cards after winning all four of the fixtures since the 2015 Rugby World Cup quarterfinal.\n\nAs for the other two words driving Bok fans to distraction \u2013 J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s is a former helicopter builder who is so hands-free he may well be a helicopter referee. He should turn the match into a lottery.", "description": "Semifinal will see Boks try to wear out Wales, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s throws a spanner in the works.", "authors": ["Simnikiwe Xabanisa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9523/a6ec3de649474c3383100e1f5746537c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
