Gaby Wood, literary director of the Booker Prize Foundation, said prize trustees repeatedly told the judges they couldn\u2019t have two winners, but they \u201cessentially staged a sit-in in the judging room\u201d as deliberations dragged on for five hours.\n\nWood insisted the decision \u201cdoesn\u2019t set a precedent.\u201d It means Atwood and Evaristo will split the 50,000 pound ($63,000) Booker Prize purse.\n\nFlorence said both of the winning books \u201caddress the world today and give us insights into it and create characters that resonate with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey also happen to be wonderfully compelling page-turning thrillers,\u201d he added.\n\nBoth winners said they were happy to share the prize.\n\n\u201cIt would have been quite embarrassing for a person of my age and stage to have won the whole thing and thereby have kept a younger one, at different stage of their career, from going through that door,\u201d said Atwood, who at 79 is the oldest-ever Booker winner.\n\nEvaristo said winning the Booker was something that \u201cfelt so unattainable for decades.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m just absolutely delighted to have the prize and to share the prize,\u201d she said.\n\nAtwood, who won the Booker in 2000 for \u201cThe Blind Assassin,\u201d had been the bookmakers\u2019 favorite to win the coveted trophy for a second time with her follow-up to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Like that book \u2014 now a hit TV series \u2014 \u201cThe Testaments\u201d is set in Gilead, a theocratic republic taken root in the United States, where young women are forced to bear children for powerful men.\n\nFlorence, founder of the Hay literary festival, said Atwood\u2019s novel \u201cdoes massively more\u201d than just continue the story started in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful in its depth and exploration of the world of Gilead,\u201d he said. It might have looked like science fiction back in the day . Now it looks more politically urgent than ever before.\u201d\n\nEvaristo, who is of Anglo-Nigerian heritage, is the first black woman to take the trophy.\n\n\u201cI hope that honor doesn\u2019t last too long,\u201d she said.\n\nShe has published seven previous books but is less known than her co-winner.\n\nFlorence said he wasn\u2019t worried Evaristo, 60, would be overlooked as people focused on Atwood. He said that \u201cthere is something utterly magical\u201d about the 12 characters from many walks of life who narrate \u201cGirl, Woman, Other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey give a wonderful spectrum of black British women today,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that sense this book is ground-breaking \u2014 and I hope encouraging and inspiring to the rest of the publishing industry.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1969, the prize is open to English-language authors from around the world. It has been split between two winners twice before, most recently in 1992, when Michael Ondaatje\u2019s \u201cThe English Patient\u201d and Barry Unsworth\u2019s \u201cSacred Hunger\u201d shared the trophy. The rules were changed after that to stipulate there can only be one winner each year.\n\nJudges chose the two winners from a six-book shortlist that included British-Turkish author Elif Shafak\u2019s Istanbul-set \u201c10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World\u201d; U.S.-British writer Lucy Ellmann\u2019s stream-of-consciousness novel \u201cDucks, Newburyport\u201d; India-born British writer Salman Rushdie\u2019s modern-day Don Quixote story, \u201cQuichotte\u201d; and \u201cAn Orchestra of Minorities,\u201d a saga of love and exile by Nigeria\u2019s Chigozie Obioma.\n\nThe prize, which often delivers a big boost in sales and profile to the winner, was sponsored for 18 years by investment firm Man Group and was known as the Man Booker Prize. This year it reverted to its original name, the Booker Prize, under a new sponsor: the Crankstart Foundation, founded by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Michael Moritz and his wife, writer Harriet Heyman.", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Canadian writer Margaret Atwood and British author Bernardine Evaristo split the Booker Prize on Monday, after the judging panel ripped up", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/0245c8_britain-booker-prize-68752-margaret-atwood-in-tuesday-sept-10-2019-file-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
