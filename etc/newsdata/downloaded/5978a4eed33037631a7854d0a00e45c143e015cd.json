Before adopting the Mazda3 moniker, this car was known as the Mazda 323; a living legend in South Africa\u2019s automotive history.\n\n\n\nREAD: Going premium| Next-gen Mazda3 moves the Japanese bran d into a new era in SA\n\nWe take a critical look at the latest iteration of Mazda\u2019s most successful product.\n\nImage: Charlen Raymond\n\nSplendid design cues\n\nThe car\u2019s design does not stray too far from the previous model\u2019s, and still gives clear hints that it is the 3. From the front, the grille has been enlarged with the badge taking centre stage just above the number plate. A chrome strip runs around it and leads to the headlights. These units, daytime-running LEDs, have a sharp and edgy design about them, yet they manage to project generous lighting in poorly lit conditions.\n\nThe side profile is somewhat bland when viewed in tandem with the front, but at least two big doors on either side provide easy entry and exit to the vehicle. At the rear, two chrome-tipped exhaust pipes sit on the outer edges of the bumper, while the darkened light clusters lend the car a sense of mystery. The boot, operated via a button underneath the badge or from the key fob, allows access to storage space of up to 444 ltres.\n\nImage: Charlen Raymond\n\nPremium-feel cabin\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know, you\u2019d be forgiven for mistaking the Mazda3\u2019s interior for that of a German brand. Mazda really went above and over to improve the cabin and its feel, and it shows. This Individual is covered in leather seats, electric adjustment for the driver\u2019s seat, keyless entry, heads-up display, and rake and reach adjustment for the steering wheel.\n\nThe use of soft-touch materials adorns the interior and the stitched leather where the panels meet further enhances the interior\u2019s feel. The sense of space is carried throughout and one is never confronted with the feeling that you\u2019re cramped; albeit a bit if you're a rear passenger.\n\nWhat Mazda has to be commended on is its new and revised multimedia system. Operated from a knob between the front seats, users can navigate their way through a raft of features and easy-to-understand menus. A gripe, however, is that the system can\u2019t keep up with swift commands. During the test period, the colour screen atop the dashboard would often freeze and can\u2019t none of the menus could be accessed. The system would only reset after the car has been switched off and on. This does seem as if it could be fixed perhaps with a quick software upgrade.\n\nImage: Charlen Raymond\n\nStill no turbo engine?\n\nMazda is quite adamant that it will not be implementing turbo technology to their vehicles, bar diesel models. Whereas its Japanese rivals, such as Toyota and Honda, have gone the turbo route with the new Corolla and revised Civic, respectively, but Mazda is staying put with their non-turbo petrol engines.\n\nThis does have a profound effect on the car\u2019s driveability, as well as how it copes on the road with four passengers and their luggage. The car\u2019s 1.5-litre petrol engine produces a modest 88kW and 153Nm; the latter only available at a heady 4000rpm. The six-speed manual gearbox requires a bit of work to haul everything around and you have to judge an overtake carefully to prevent any chance of running out of steam or road.\n\nJuggling life in the city is a different story, however. The Mazda3, with no weight penalty, is a joy to drive and the lightweight steering adds to driver enjoyment.\n\nThanks to stop/start technology (and a light foot), the 3 returned just under 7.0-litres/100km at the end of the test.\n\nImage: Charlen Raymond\n\nSummary\n\nMazda really went the extra mile with their new 3 and can one say with certainty that they will add to the six million units that\u2019s already been sold. The car, as a whole, is well-specified and prospective buyers will certainly see their money\u2019s worth.\n\nThe glitch with the multimedia might be unit-specific, but it is something the automaker has to look into.\n\nThe Mazda3 1.5 Individual sedan retails from R418 800 and comes standard with a three-year or unlimited kilometre service plan, as well as a three-year or unlimited km warranty.", "description": "'The Mazda3 is well-specified and prospective buyers will certainly see their money\u2019s worth,\" writes Wheels24 correspondent Charlen Raymond.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9490/5f934584e10b4d449e684aca17d9fb8b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
