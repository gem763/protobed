It has arrived. The Lifetime movie version of the college admissions scandal \u2014 evocatively titled \u201cThe College Admissions Scandal\" \u2014 aired Saturday night. And it is, as anticipated, pretty bonkers. (Even if the real-life story might be crazier than any film Lifetime could produce.)\n\nThe main thing you need to know: No, sadly, this movie isn\u2019t about Lori Loughlin or Felicity Huffman, the highest-profile names in the FBI\u2019s sensational Operation Varsity Blues in which nearly 50 wealthy parents were accused of facilitating bribes to get their children into prestigious universities. Last month, Huffman was sentenced to two weeks in jail for paying $15,000 for someone to correct her daughter\u2019s SAT answers. Loughlin\u2019s case is still pending, but she is accused of paying $500,000 to get her daughters enrolled as crew recruits at the University of Southern California, although neither rowed crew.\n\nInstead the film focuses on the fictional \u201cCaroline\" and \u201cBethany,\u201d an interior decorator and a money manager obsessed with getting their kids into Stanford and Yale, respectively. Of course, this backfires spectacularly when they get involved with Rick Singer, a \u201cconsultant\u201d who promises parents he knows exactly what these prestigious schools are looking for in applicants \u2014 and for a few extra hundred- thousand dollars, he can throw in some \u201cextra\u201d services, like inflated SAT scores or bribes to athletic coaches who will recruit your kid for their team even if they don\u2019t play the sport.\n\nThe movie is careful to say it\u2019s inspired by true events \u2014 the real-life Singer has pleaded guilty in connection with the scam \u2014 but with the disclaimer that it\u2019s fictionalized for dramatic purposes and any similarity to real-life situations are not intentional. Still, here are the five craziest scenes:\n\n[California businessman sentenced to four months in college admissions bribery scandal]\n\n1) The \u201cEmory zone.\u201d\n\nThe movie has a great deal of fun skewering stressed-out helicopter moms and dads fixated on brand-name colleges. At one point, a group of concerned rich parents gathers at a local coffee shop. \u201cMolly barely broke 1300,\u201d one mom says, sounding on the verge of tears because that\u2019s not even in the \u201cEmory zone,\u201d referring to Emory University. While Molly is trying to up her philanthropy game by tutoring abused kids at a homeless shelter, that apparently doesn\u2019t matter to college admissions officers anymore \u2014 these days, you have to start your own charitable program and get press coverage for it.\n\n\u201cThis is gonna kill me. This is absolutely gonna kill me,\u201d the mom moans. Then they turn their attention to Caroline: How did her Danny do on the SATs?\n\nCaroline looks as if she is delivering the news of a terminal illness; viewers already know that Danny has more interest in his band than going to college. \u201cYou know boys that age and testing,\u201d she says, trying to sound breezy. \u201cBut we are siccing an army of tutors on him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow bad was it?\u201d one mom prods.\n\nCaroline pauses. \u201cHigh 12s,\" she says quietly. Cue the gasps.\n\nThat\u2019s when Bethany strolls into the conversation with coffee in hand and a villainous smirk on her face. \u201cIt sounds like we\u2019re all burning in the same inferno,\u201d she says; after all, her daughter Emma isn\u2019t exactly a testing whiz. That\u2019s when Bethany makes the fateful suggestion: Have they ever heard of a college consultant named Rick Singer?\n\n2) Meet Rick Singer.\n\nSinger, the consultant who flipped on his clients when he decided to cooperate with the FBI investigation, is the only person whose real name is used in the movie. Michael Shanks plays the slick-talking strategist who simultaneously calms nervous high school students about college pressures while slyly telling their parents that they can use bribes to expedite the admissions process. One lively montage flips between Singer\u2019s meetings with Bethany and Caroline\u2019s families.\n\n\u201cDo I stand a chance in hell of getting into Stanford?\u201d Danny asks.\n\n\u201cIs my mom on crack?\u201d Emma demands to know.\n\nSinger\u2019s response is beautiful: \u201cNo more than everybody\u2019s parents are on crack.\u201d\n\n3) This slightly deranged monologue.\n\nThe parents are definitely the villains in this story. While Emma would like to get into Yale, which her boyfriend attends, she\u2019s also perfectly happy to consider nearby Trinity College. \u201cDon\u2019t give me heart attacks,\u201d Bethany shudders. For reasons that are never probed by the script, she wants her daughter to go to Yale.\n\nSo Bethany sits Emma down and tells her the deal: At Rick\u2019s suggestion, she\u2019s going to have to pretend she plays soccer \u2014 so she can be recruited by Yale\u2019s coach \u2014 and also sit with a therapist who will then sign a note to give her extra time to take the SAT. Emma is doubtful about the morality of this plan, but her mother uncorks this barnburner of a monologue:\n\n\u201cEmma. Darling. Do you remember when we went on college tour and we saw these concert halls and the stadiums that were named after the families that gave the money to build them? Do you think the descendants of those people had trouble getting into those schools? Of course not. And we understand that, and we think it\u2019s fair. Because we know those people gave that money to help preserve the future of the children they love. Right? I mean, I can\u2019t endow a concert hall, but I can do whatever I can for the child I love. And I mean, it\u2019s not just the wealthy who find the ways to do the best for their children. Like, what parent of a brilliant minority child wouldn\u2019t take every advantage they can? I\u2019ve read about minority kids who have been accepted by Ivy League schools with SATs 200 points lower than yours. And we understand that, and we think that\u2019s fair. Because we know those communities are doing whatever they can for the children they love. They have their advantages and we have ours. It\u2019s just one continuum. You studied Darwin last year, didn\u2019t you? It is the natural way of the world. Some species survive and some don\u2019t. Some people can do this for their kids and some people can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nEmma eventually agrees, as Bethany takes a menacing sip of a kale smoothie.\n\n4) Emma\u2019s green-screen scene.\n\nThe real-life criminal complaint alleged that some parents had pictures of their kids altered to make it look like they played a sport, which they then submitted on their application. So poor Emma is forced to put on a soccer uniform and kick around a ball in front of a green screen while a photographer snaps away. Thanks to the magic of Photoshop, the background suddenly turns into a soccer field! It\u2019s so bad that Emma\u2019s suspicious guidance counselor calls her in for a meeting. Luckily, Bethany is there to steamroll with vague threats about enrolling her daughter in another pricey private school.\n\n5) Danny\u2019s emotional showdown with his parents.\n\nWhile Caroline and her husband, Jackson, are very reluctant to participate in Singer\u2019s conspiracy, they rationalize that it\u2019s no different than donating a building \u2014 and if Danny doesn\u2019t get into Stanford, he might end up as a starving musician on the streets! So without his knowledge, they pay one of Singer\u2019s employees to correct Danny\u2019s answers on the SAT, raising his score by nearly 400 points.\n\nAfter the police show up to arrest them, Danny tearfully confronts his parents. \u201cIf you say one more word about how you did it for me, you will never see me again,\" he says. \"You did it for one reason: So you could have something to say at cocktail parties that would make your friends jealous.\u201d\n\nHonestly? He\u2019s not wrong.\n\nRead more:\n\nBefore Lori Loughlin\u2019s alleged cheating scandal, daughter Olivia Jade made her life at USC a YouTube brand\n\nThe speech by Lori Loughlin\u2019s \u2018Fuller House\u2019 co-stars at the Kids\u2019 Choice Awards was a masterful PR move\n\nThe college admissions scandal isn\u2019t just about rich, entitled people", "description": "\"You studied Darwin last year, didn\u2019t you?
