Our hope is that it will be returned to us, and these recent recurring events will become an educational opportunity,\u201d said Sarah Clawson, the district ranger for the Bradshaw Ranger District.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Prescott National Forest tweeted photos of the missing boulder that is black with a strip of white quartz running through it.\n\n\"Wizard Rock\" Boulder Disappears from White Spar Hwy Prescott National Forest Officials Seek Its Return https://t.co/QFUtVgV2LT #WizardRock #PrescottAZ Photo #1 Courtesy of PNF Geologist Frances Alvarado; Photos 2 & 3 Courtesy of Karen Johnson pic.twitter.com/fTFRaU8PjO \u2014 Prescott NF (@PrescottNF) October 28, 2019\n\nTrails and Wilderness Manager Jason Williams said whoever stole the popular tourist attraction must have used heavy equipment to lift it.\n\n\u201cThe easy way to do it would be a back hoe,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut, if you had a trailer positioned properly and didn\u2019t mind beating some things up you might be able to do it with a Bobcat. But you surely aren\u2019t going to be able to do it any other way.\u201d\n\nWilliams said he believes people saw the person take the rock but did not know they were witnessing a theft in progress.\n\n\u201cI think what happens is the general public, if they see somebody working with equipment in the forest, they see the equipment and assume it\u2019s an authorized thing. It looks professional and they think they must be doing something the forest service has said \u2018go ahead\u2019 or even paid for,\u201d he concluded.\n\nOfficials said this is not the first time someone has taken a boulder from the national forest. In 2009, an 80-pound rock shaped like a heart vanished from Granite Mountain Wilderness.\n\nHowever, once the story made it into the local newspaper the boulder was returned.\n\nIt is illegal for anyone without a permit to remove minerals from national forest land, and anyone caught doing so could face a maximum $5,000 fine or up to six months in jail, or both, according to AZCentral.com.\n\nOfficials have asked anyone with information leading to the boulder\u2019s whereabouts to call 928-443-8110.", "description": "Officials are asking for the public's help in finding a popular tourist attraction that disappeared from a national forest in Arizona.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Wizard-Rock-2-USDA-Karen-Johnson-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
