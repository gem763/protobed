Just 40 percent opposed impeachment.\n\nNo surprise there's a divide along party lines. Eighty-five percent of Democrats support impeachment and removal, compared with 39 percent of independents and 13 percent of Republicans.\n\nREAD: Trump\u2019s legal position on impeachment is bananas\n\nThough Democrats worried for months about the politics of impeachment, support for it has only risen since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi officially announced an inquiry in late September over Trump\u2019s actions with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nVoters of all backgrounds increasingly support impeachment, according to the new Fox poll. Since July, support for impeachment rose 11 percentage points among Democrats, 5 points among Republicans and 3 points among independents.\n\nThe Fox poll interviewed 1,003 registered voters from October 6 through October 8. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nREAD: Here are 7 crimes Trump might have committed in this Ukraine scandal\n\nOverall, recent polls have shown an increase in support for impeaching Trump. The FiveThirtyEight tracker on the subjects shows a sharp uptick since late September, coinciding with the flood of news about Ukraine. As of Thursday, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s average of polls had 49.2 percent of Americans supporting impeachment, with 43.3 percent not supporting.\n\nThe rise in support for impeachment might be cause for concern in the White House. Impeachment is, after all, a political process. And while most GOP members of Congress have stayed aboard the Trump train thus far, it would stand to reason they\u2019d hop off if their political futures were jeopardized.\n\nRepublican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, for instance, hasn\u2019t outright supported impeachment but did say on Friday that \u201cthe President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nOther GOP members of Congress are leaving the door open as well.\n\n\u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t vote to impeach on the basis of what I\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a former executive director of the Republican National Committee, told CNBC this week. \u201cI\u2019m not going to rule it in or out.\u201d\n\nCover: President Donald Trump answers questions from reporters during an event on \"transparency in Federal guidance and enforcement\" in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019, in Washington.
