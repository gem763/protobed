It has a joint in the hip with a self-aligning module, and a spinal mechanism that bends together with the wearer and takes the load from the spine.\"\n\nThe carbon fibre rods on the rear give a supportive lift, taking the strain off your back, while the springs on the thighs give a small push on the legs.\n\nThe 6.3 kilo suit is passive while the wearer is walking around, and only activates when needed, with sensors in the chest alerting the device when the person wants to bend down.\n\n\"It basically knows what you\u2019re doing, it knows what you were doing, and it predicts, based on the probability, it predicts what you will do next,\"says Babi\u010d.\n\nThe Spexor researchers study how humans bend their backs using body sensors that buzz when you lift something incorrectly.\n\nThey use the system to teach people how to move better, but argue an exoskeleton does have an important role to play in preventing problems.\n\nSpexor project partner Prof Dr Nejc \u0160arabon, Director at S2P Science To Practice, tells Euronews: \"Gaining the right techniques of everyday motions is the right way to go in addition with making muscles stronger and acting properly. But sometimes we can\u2019t avoid those detrimental forces, and this is where other solutions, like external support come in.\"\n\nTesting in a real-life factory\n\nSo much for the theory, what about the practice?\n\n\u0160arabon is responsible for end-user evaluation in the project, and invites Euronews to film a testing session at engineering company Hidria. Its 2,000 employees produce components for the automotive sector, and they often have to move items manually.\n\nOnce they're wearing it, the exoskeleton transfers force from the worker's back to their legs, giving them a boost. So what do they think?\n\nRomana Kajdi\u017e, Operator at Hidria, tells us: \"It pushes here on the lumbar; here at the sides; it moves in an elastic way, the feeling is really nice.\"\n\n\"As long as it will reduce my pain on the back, my legs, my arms, I\u2019ll be happy any way I can,\" says her colleague on the production line Tadej Dragan.\n\nWatching the exoskeleton in action in a real factory environment confirms the scientists' suspicion that this prototype is too wide and bulky.\n\n\"We are already working on a design where these motors will be on the back side, so they won\u2019t obstruct the motion of the wearer,\" says Dr Jan Babi\u010d.\n\nBurden or solution?\n\nWith a more ergonomic design the researchers believe their exoskeleton can make a difference, although they believe their biggest challenge will be convincing workers without back pain to wear it.\n\n\"If you\u2019re not treating a disease, if you\u2019re just preventing it, then it\u2019s very difficult for the wearer to accept this technology,\" says Babi\u010d. \"Usually it feels like a burden before you have a problem. Once you have a problem then you would like to cure it, but then it\u2019s too late for low back pain.\"\n\nThe next step: another partner in this EU project aims to turn this initial design into a commercially-viable product that everyone could wear.", "description": "A gentle push on the knees, a subtle lift on the chest - that's the recipe to relieve low back pain applied by EU researchers developing a new exoskeleton.
