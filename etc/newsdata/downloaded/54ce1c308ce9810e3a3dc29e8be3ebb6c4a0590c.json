You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd, addressing the metaphorical elephant in the public park, Ms Warren said that Mr Trump was perhaps the most painful symptom of that very corruption disease, even if he is not the cause itself.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is corruption in the flesh,\u201d Ms Warren said, to cheers from the crowd, which her campaign said surpassed 20,000 in attendance.\n\nIn the crowd before Ms Warren\u2019s lectern spread out a sea of signs proclaiming \u201cI\u2019m a Warren Democrat\u201d, and blaring lights that shone down on the candidate who has become perhaps as well known now for her willingness to stand for hours for selfies with supporters after events \u2014 a major driver of social media outreach, and a signal that the 70-year-old has stamina to spare \u2014 as she is for having \u201ca plan for that\u201d on a long list of issues, from military housing to student loans to climate change.\n\nOn Monday, she hit on many of those notes, but began by emphasising the insidious nature of corruption.\n\nNoting that the old Triangle Shirtwaist Factory \u2014 where 15 mostly Jewish and Italian female workers died in a 1911 workplace fire \u2014 Ms Warren illustrated the dangers of lax regulations, and the human toll that can come as a result of business running free without the constraint of worker protections.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We\u2019re here because of some hard-working women. Women who, more than a hundred years ago, worked long hours in a brown, 10-story building a block that way.\u201d\n\nMs Warren told the crowd they \u201cwouldn\u2019t have to dive very deep\u201d to see the lingering affects of loose government. From corporations polluting and contributing to climate change, to the heavy financial burden felt by Americans from simply going to school or to the doctor, she described a country in which corporations have put Americans at risk in a variety of ways.\n\nAnd, employing her catchphrase, she said she has a \u201cplan for that\u201d.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d a supporter, carrying one of those Warren Democrat signs, joked to her partner upon hearing the line.\n\nFor many of those in attendance, Ms Warren\u2019s unrelenting attack on special interests is the sign that they agree with them on something of a spiritual level as the Democratic primaries barrel closer this winter. But, her plans are what seal the deal, they said.\n\n\u201cShe really does a good job of straddling big, important \u2014 you know, as she says, big structural change ideas \u2014 but also having the pragmatic, practical plans to make that happen,\u201d said Ron Gaskill, a 32-year-old publicist from Brooklyn.\n\nMr Gaskill said he supported Bernie Sanders in the New York primary in 2016, but said he will vote for Ms Warren this year if he has the chance. He said that he believes her plans are a continuation of previous American policies of investment in social programmes and infrastructure that was more acceptable 80 years ago, and that he doesn\u2019t buy the argument that Ms Warren is too liberal to take on Mr Trump in a general election.\n\n\u201cHer way of moving forward is deeply American. It is deeply rooted in ideas that are very American, and it is not something that is outlandish or far left, it\u2019s just a really good way of making our economy strong again,\u201d he said.\n\nWhatever the case, Ms Warren has been doing a good job proving that point for the past several years, as her campaign has continued to gain steam and drawn national media attention. After a campaign launch that was described in the media as faltering, Ms Warren has seen improving poll numbers, and frequent praise for her debate performances.\n\nShe remains roughly nine points behind Joe Biden in an average of national polls, with 17 per cent support and in second place. But, those numbers have only been going up.\n\nCarolyn Lynch, a 31-year-old nurse from New Jersey, said she had never been to a political rally in her life, but that she felt inspired to see Ms Warren and become involved.\n\nAnd, when asked what she likes about Ms Warren, she noted one of the most disruptive ideas Ms Warren has floated, and said she loves the idea. Beyond her plans, Ms Lynch said she likes to hear the Democrat say she plans on getting rid of the Senate filibuster \u2014 a procedural tool that requires much more than 50 per cent support in that legislative body for a bill to become a law.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get anything passed. It\u2019s so dumb. Nothing ever happens. So I\u2019m just really excited she wants to get rid of it,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Lynch said that she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because she just thought she could win. But, she said that she thinks that the very forces that allowed Mr Trump to win in 2016, show that Ms Warren can win, and is not to liberal a candidate as many worry.\n\n\u201cI think the whole reason everyone voted for Trump is \u2026 that they wanted change in the 2016 election, and then there was none,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want change. But people are just scared for things like that. They\u2019re like oh that\u2019s too big, that\u2019s too progressive, but people want that.\u201d", "description": "Framed by the iconic marble arch in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park, Elizabeth Warren unveiled a sweeping anti-corruption plan as she sought to continue the momentum that has thrust her campaign into the national spotlight and placed her name among the frontrunners to challenge Donald Trump in 2020.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/16/21/Elizabeth-Warren-Washington-Square-Park-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
