This risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering, and undermining the progress made against Daesh which should be our collective focus.\"\n\nThe foreign secretary said the UK would resist plans for Syrian refugees to be returned to the so-called safe zone.\n\nEuropean states immediately condemned the Turkish incursion and called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Thursday. The EU called for an immediate stop to the attack, warning it would \"undermine the stability of the whole region\".\n\nDonald Trump, who has given contradictory messages in recent days, said the attack was \u201ca bad idea\u201d but did not call for a halt. He said Turkey had promised to protect civilians and avoid a humanitarian disaster \u201cand we will hold them to this commitment\u201d.\n\nThe Turkish attack appeared to immediately embolden Isil loyalists, confirming the fears of Western security officials that the jihadists would try to take advantage of the chaos caused by the fighting.\n\nTurkish army vehicles drive towards the Syrian border near Akcakale on Wednesday Credit: BULENT KILIC/AFP More\n\nThere were reports of rioting by female Isil prisoners against their guards at al-Hol, the vast detention camp where 70,000 women and children are being held.
