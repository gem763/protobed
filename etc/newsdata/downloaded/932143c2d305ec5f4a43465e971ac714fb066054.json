India is reportedly considering banning palm oil imports from Malaysia, in response to a comment Mahathir made on Jammu and Kashmir. Twitter/@narendramodi\n\nIs a trade war looming for Malaysia?\n\nIndia, Malaysia\u2019s 10th largest trading partner, is reportedly considering restricting imports from the country to punish its prime minister for comments made at the United Nations General Assembly speech last month.\n\nOn Friday (Oct 11), Reuters reported exclusively that India was considering restricting imports of some products from the South-east Asian nation, including palm oil.\n\nCiting unnamed government and industry sources, Reuters said the Indian government was \u201clooking for ways to limit palm oil imports and may place restrictions on other goods from the country\u201d.\n\nThe source of India\u2019s fury was a comment made by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Jammu and Kashmir \u2013 a Himalayan region at the centre of dispute between India and Pakistan \u2013 at the UN event on September 27.\n\nMahathir had said that \u201cdespite UN resolution on Jammu and Kashmir, the country has been invaded and occupied\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere may be reasons for this action but it is still wrong. The problem must be solved by peaceful means. India should work with Pakistan to resolve this problem. Ignoring the UN would lead to other forms of disregard for the UN and the Rule of Law,\u201d he added.\n\nThe 94-year-old premier later published the same comments on his Twitter account.\n\nMahathir: Avoid trade war\n\nSo far, it seems that India has not made a firm decision on any possible curbs to trade with Malaysia.\n\nMahathir was quoted by Reuters as saying that he had not received official word from India of any trade ban.\n\n\u201cThat is only reported, but we have not received anything official,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\nIn a report on Sunday, state news agency Bernama also quoted the PM as saying that both countries needed to avoid any cause for trade war as it would not be beneficial for both economies.\n\n\u201cWe will study the impact of the action taken by India. They are exporting goods to Malaysia too. It\u2019s not just one-way trade, it\u2019s two-way trade,\u201d Bernama quoted him as saying.\n\nThe government had no plan to give an immediate response to Reuters\u2019 report, he added.\n\nIndia is the second-largest buyer of Malaysia\u2019s palm oil, with 150,000 tonnes imported monthly, Bernama reported.\n\nA ban would likely result in India substituting Malaysian palm oil with edible oils from Indonesia, Argentina and Ukraine, Reuters reported its source as saying.\n\nTwitter storm\n\nMahathir\u2019s comments on Jammu and Kashmir had earlier also sparked angry reactions on social media, with Indian social media users calling for a boycott on all things Malaysian.\n\nAfter the #BoycottMalaysia became one of Twitter\u2019s top trending hashtags in the two countries, Malaysians argued back with calls for their fellow countrymen to also boycott India.\n\nMahathir addressed the social media reactions on October 8, saying that India\u2019s PM Narendra Modi had not given him any feedback about his UN speech. \u201cI had told (Prime Minister of India) Narendra Modi to contact me if he is unhappy or dissatisfied,\u201d he was quoted by New Straits Times (NST) as saying.\n\nCalling the comments \u201cmild criticisms of India\u201d, Mahathir reportedly said that he had also brought up the Jammu and Kashmir issue to Modi when they met in Russia before the UN event.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t give criticism to side with anyone, but we call for both parties to discuss, use arbitration or go to the court of law, not to resort to violence,\u201d he added.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Is a trade war looming for Malaysia?.
