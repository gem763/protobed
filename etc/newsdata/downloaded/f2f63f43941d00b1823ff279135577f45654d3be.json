There is no evidence that mainstream media outlets have irresponsibly published information damaging to the national interest.\n\nFor example, when the ABC was gifted hundreds of highly classified documents, inexplicably left in an ex-government filing-cabinet bought at a Canberra second-hand shop, it selectively published information judged to be in the public interest, but handed back the most sensitive documents.\n\nIt is clear, however, that technology poses new risks to national security, and makes it easier for masses of government data to be stolen and dumped on the internet by ideologically-driven, non-state, non-journalist actors such as Julian Assange, who are determined to irresponsibly wreak maximum damage on nation-states heedless of security considerations.\n\nThis may be the subtext to the heavy-handed AFP raids, which appear calculated to send the message that the full resources of the law will be employed to rumble any local Edward Snowden-style leakers. But conscientious reporters simply doing their job \u2013 and fulfilling the crucial mission of a free media \u2013 have been caught up in this.\n\nAttorney-General Christian Porter vows to use his discretionary powers to stop any prosecution of journalists who are simply doing their jobs. But press freedom should not depend on ministerial whim. The chilling threat of being subject to intrusive police investigations and charges is likely to intimidate and deter all but the bravest reporters.\n\nThis is why the Right to Know coalition calls for new legal protections for good public interest journalism including protections for whistleblowers, exemptions for reporters from being jailed under security laws, and overdue changes to stultifying defamation laws and Freedom of Information processes.\n\nCommissioner Reece Kershaw told Senate estimates yesterday that the AFP was reviewing how it handles sensitive investigations involving press freedom. But more is needed than a low-level inquiry announced on the run. The reforms proposed by the media coalition would represent a win not so much for a media class that challenges the self-interest of politicians, or even for the bottom line of media companies, but for the health of Australian democracy.\n\nThe cynical but plainly justified belief that self-serving governments always have something to hide is contributing to growing community distrust in our political institutions. Greater transparency would help restore public confidence in the system; for a truly free, independent and vigorous press remains a lubricant of democracy that ultimately checks the self-interest of those empowered to govern.", "description": "The Prime Minster thinks a free press threatens national security.
