Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 1% increase in August.\n\n--Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, attributed the rise to low interest rates, but noted that low inventory was still an issue. \"With interest rates expected to remain low, home sales are forecasted to rise in the coming months and into 2020. Unfortunately, so far in 2019, new home construction is down 2.0%. The hope is that housing starts quickly move into higher gear to meet the higher demand,\" he said.\n\n--The association said last week sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million in August, up 1.3% from July.\n\nWrite to Likhitha Butchireddygari at likhitha.butchireddygari@wsj.com and David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 10:14 ET (14:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
