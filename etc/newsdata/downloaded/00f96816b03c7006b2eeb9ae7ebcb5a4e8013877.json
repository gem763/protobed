Not to find love, obviously.\"\n\nSpeaking about his future plans, Kenna said: \"For me, it's to launch my vegan apple and cheese ice cream product my Christmas time. But yeah, definitely like I said, to stay in the public eye and to do more TV work.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nKenna admitted that he was \"genuinely shocked\" to be fired and described it as \"horrible\".\n\n\"I thought I was staying in the boardroom for 59 minutes,\" he said. \"At the end I was like, 'Oh s***, dean's staying, it's got to be me'.\"\n\nQuestioned about whether being part of the process was what he expected: \"Yes and no. It was as intense as I thought it would be but being in it, now you understand why people look the way they do.\n\n\"Last week, for example, where Ryan had mistaken a rhino for an elephant, I was thinking 'This is scripted, they're telling them to do this' but literally, it was 1,000 meters away and you genuinely understand why he made that mistake. So being part of the process you understand why these things happen.\"\n\n*The Apprentice returns next Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Kenna Ngoma told Mirror TV that he is keen to stay on telly after his short, and not so sweet, Apprentice journey", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Pa", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20548110.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_The-Apprentice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
