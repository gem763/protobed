They should be able to respect that. There is no dress code but it is just common sense.\n\n\"They were told not to by the hotel management, but they said it was a form of art.\"\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\nMajor Jess Baylon, police chief of the island's Malay station, said the tourist was fined PHP2,500 for \"display of erotic and lewd picture\".\n\nJess said the bikini was \"literally just a piece of string\".\n\nShe added: \"Her boyfriend said 'It's quite normal for us in our country and that was her way to express herself with confidence'.\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\n\"But their customs and traditions are not the same in our country. They have to respect our culture and tradition, and our proper decorum.\n\nThe Taiwanese couple left Boracay Island last Friday afternoon.\n\nPolice have now urged hotel and resort owners in the area to tell their guests about clothing and behaviour.", "description": "Lin Tzu Ting, 26, was on holiday with her boyfriend when she opted for the revealing garment - sparking shock with some locals who decided to call the police", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Viralpress"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574629.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_PAY-NEWSLINK8852681_103112.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
