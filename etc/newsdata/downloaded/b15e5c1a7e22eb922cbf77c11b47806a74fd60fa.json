At least until Carell\u2019s Kessler is fired following allegations of sexual misconduct. Meanwhile, outside the Big Apple, Witherspoon plays Bradley Jackson, a rough-around-the-edges local reporter in West Virginia. And as viewers quickly realized when the series\u2019 first trailer premiered, Witherspoon is rocking both a Southern accent and a brown wig for the part.\n\nView photos Frank Masi/Apple More\n\n\u201c[The wig] was Reese\u2019s idea,\u201d showrunner Kerry Ehrin recalls. \u201cI think we tried the blond and then we tried a brown wig and when we saw it, it felt so different. And Bradley is just a little bit of a darker character. We just saw her as a little more dark and sarcastic and cynical.\u201d\n\nWitherspoon explains, \u201cI had just gotten done playing Madeline in Big Little Lies and I wanted to do some stuff that was different. I didn\u2019t feel like my character would be concerned with her hair or maintaining a certain hair color. She\u2019s a very low-maintenance, pragmatic person. She\u2019s an on-air traveling news reporter when we first meet her, so she literally has to be ready on the fly.\u201d\n\nThe Morning Show premieres on Apple TV+ on Nov. 1.\n\nWant more Fall TV Preview scoop?
