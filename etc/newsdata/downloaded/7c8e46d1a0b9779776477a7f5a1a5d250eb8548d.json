According to a source with direct knowledge of Trump\u2019s grievance, the president repeatedly made clear that he wanted there to be consequences for CNN\u2019s alleged malfeasance (though the released videos showed fairly mundane, if not outright boring, editorial meetings).\n\nAnd consequences there were\u2014at least in the form of a deeply meaningless letter.\n\nRepresenting both the president and the 2020 Trump campaign, Gawker-killing celebrity lawyer Charles Harder sent a four-page document to Zucker and CNN General Counsel David Vigilante alleging the news channel was violating the law with its coverage. In the letter, Trump and Harder threatened to sue CNN for falsely advertising itself as a legitimate news outlet, in addition to seeking \u201csubstantial payment of damages\u201d as part of some sort of resolution.\n\nReached for comment by phone on Friday, Harder simply hung up and wouldn\u2019t answer questions about Trump\u2019s role in crafting the letter. (The president has been known to enthusiastically suggest insults and jabs in his lawyers\u2019 missives.) A Harder spokesman also declined to comment and said that the letter spoke for itself.\n\nOn Friday, CNN rejected the letter as \u201cnothing more than a desperate PR stunt and doesn\u2019t merit a response,\u201d and numerous lawyer and legal experts laughed it off as amounting to little more than mere whining.\n\nThe delivery of the Trump attorney\u2019s four-page document was a blip on the news cycle, but one that offered a glimpse into how the president has often responded over the decades when he feels besieged. In his game-show host years and real-estate days, he and his legal counsel would frequently lean on lawsuits and legal threats as an intimidation tactic\u2014even if they knew there was no chance of it advancing in the courts. It\u2019s a strategy that Trump hasn\u2019t abandoned, even after he became leader of the free world. And with impeachment at the hands of House Democrats looming, one senior White House official said that the president\u2019s impulse to sue, or say he\u2019ll sue, \u201ceverybody who pisses him off\u201d is only intensifying.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just CNN. According to two people close to the president, Trump has also asked his lawyers and advisers about options for legal retaliation against other news outlets, including MSNBC and The Washington Post. Neither of these sources thought much of anything would come of Trump\u2019s inquiries, and simply viewed it as part of the president\u2019s habitual venting about his vast array of perceived enemies in politics and national media.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s first instinct on these types of things is very often: \u2018Sue, sue, sue, then sue some more,\u2019\u201d one of these confidants said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean he gets what he wants.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has also openly fantasized about suing one of his perennial Democratic foes, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who leads the probe into the whistleblower complaint that kick-started congressional impeachment drive.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal attorneys Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani (the latter of which remains at the center of the scandal and controversy fueling the impeachment inquiry) told The Daily Beast this month that they have been actively involved in discussions with the president regarding potential avenues for legal action against Schiff. Though none has been taken thus far, Sekulow said that \u201call options are on the table,\u201d and that any legal maneuver or court challenge would focus on due-process issues. \u201cWe have five lawyers working on it, and I was up until 2 a.m. [one] night researching Supreme Court cases because I want to know the limits of congressional immunity,\u201d Giuliani said early this month.\n\nThe president has even acknowledged that there may be zero legal standing for him to successfully sue the congressman. Nevertheless, Trump maintains that he just doesn\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cSue him anyway, even if we lose, the American public will understand,\u201d the president said at a speech at this month\u2019s Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cAnd sue Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Trump added, for good measure.\n\nTo those who know the president, none of this is particularly surprising. Trump has long been a fan of frivolous legal action as a tool of retribution against celebrities, media personalities, and others. In 2013, Trump sued HBO\u2019s Real Time host Bill Maher for $5 million after the comedian joked that he\u2019d give away $5 million to charity if Trump could provide evidence that he wasn\u2019t the \u201cthe spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan.\u201d (This was a satirical jab at the future president, who was then a key figure in the racist, anti-Obama birther movement that demanded that President Barack Obama prove he was in fact born in the United States.)\n\nPredictably, nothing came of the suit.\n\nIn 2006, Trump very publicly threatened to sue comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell, then a View co-host and one of his arch-nemeses. \u201cProbably I\u2019ll sue her,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cBecause it would be fun. I\u2019d like to take some money out of her fat-ass pockets\u201d for some of her contemptuous comments about him and his business empire. He also said during this tirade that \u201cRosie\u2019s a person that\u2019s very lucky to have her girlfriend. And she better be careful or I\u2019ll send one of my friends over to pick up her girlfriend [because] why would she stay with Rosie if she had another choice?\u201d\n\nThis zeal for legal saber-rattling continued through his presidential campaign, and well into his time in office.\n\nAt one point early during the 2016 election campaign, Trump was watching his favorite cable channel, Fox News, and noticed a segment in which two hosts were having a heated argument about Trump, with one host saying things friendly to the future president and the other pushing back hard. Nothing slanderous or particularly explosive was said. Regardless, this didn\u2019t stop Trump from picking up the phone shortly after the segment aired, and calling the Trump-friendly host to suggest to that person that they sue the other Fox News personality.\n\n\u201cI know a good lawyer [you can use],\u201d Trump said, according to this person, who asked for the two hosts to remain anonymous as a condition of reporting this anecdote. The source recalled laughing and then politely declining the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s offer.\n\n\u2014With additional reporting by Will Sommer", "description": "The president is reverting to his bad habits.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571707421/191021-swin-trump-sue-tease-2_jrkwxp", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
