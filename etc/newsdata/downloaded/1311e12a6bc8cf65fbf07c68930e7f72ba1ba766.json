It also received a mention during \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d when cast member Heidi Gardner returned as teen movie critic Bailey Gismert to fill Michael Che in on all the films she\u2019s checked out recently. What did she think of It Chapter Two? \u201cPennywise, you keep hanging out with those same kids? Like, you\u2019re a dusty-ass clown. Awkward!\u201d What about Judy? \u201cI\u2019m in jazz choir too, but I didn\u2019t make a whole jazz-choir movie about it.\u201d When Che brings up Joker, however, the tone noticeably shifts. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s like, psycho, but like, it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle,\u201d she says coyly. \u201cBailey, do you like the Joker?!\u201d Che asks, surprised. \u201cOkay, his name is Arthur. And I don\u2019t \u2018like\u2019 him, I just like \u2026 think I could help him.\u201d But Bismert feels, like, super awkward admitting she actually likes Joker in front of Che: \u201cI know you know him \u2019cause you\u2019re both, like, trying to do comedy or whatever. Like, if you tell him that I like him, like, he could kill me!\u201d Don\u2019t embarrass Bailey like this, Che!\n\nRelated", "description": "On \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019 Heidi Gardner returned to the \u201cWeekend Update\u201d desk as teen movie critic Bailey Gismert to review Todd Phillips\u2019s \u2018Joker.\u2019", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/12/snl-gardner-joker-update.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
