However, it overlaps with territorial claims made by Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan.\n\nBeijing blames the United States for increasing tensions by sending warships and military planes close to islands claimed by China.\n\nMalaysia had been critical of China\u2019s South China Sea position but has been less outspoken recently, especially after China pumped billions of dollars into infrastructure projects under its Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has also said Malaysia was too small to stand up to the Asian powerhouse, even as Chinese ships surveyed its waters for oil and gas without permission.\n\nSaifuddin said Malaysia would continue to push its position on non-militarization of the South China Sea, and for the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to take a united approach in dealing with China and the United States.\n\n\u201cThe South China Sea should not become a point of conflict among countries. We are consistent on that at international fora such as ASEAN, where we raise the concept of self-restraint and non-militarization in the South China Sea,\u201d he said.", "description": "Malaysia needs to boost its naval capabilities to prepare for possible conflict in the South China Sea, its foreign minister said on Thursday, even as Southeast Asia's third-largest economy pursues non-militarization of the disputed waterway.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441747566&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0AQ", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
