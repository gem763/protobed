Park Han-ki told lawmakers during a parliamentary audit.\n\nHowever, he noted that \"at least weeks or months will be necessary for their restoration\".\n\nA senior JCS officer then said that no moves for restoration have been detected at the moment.\n\nAfter his talks with the United States held in Sweden last week broke down, the North's top nuclear negotiator Kim Myong-gil said: \"Whether our suspension of the nuclear and ICBM tests will continue or they will be revived will depend wholly on the U.S. stance.\"\n\nNorth Korea recently tested the Pukguksong-3, a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).\n\nThe chairman said that the weapon does not seem to be at the stage of operational deployment.\n\nHe said the SLBM is believed to be a two-stage, solid-fuel missile with extended flight range, The Korea Herald reports.\n\nExperts said the missile is believed to have a flight range of 2,000 km or longer.\n\nThe Pukguksong-1 SLBM and the Pukguksong-2 ground-based missile have flight ranges of around 1,300 km.\n\nThe JCS has vowed to accelerate the establishment of protection facilities, pointing to potential threats from North Korea's electromagnetic pulse (EMP) bombs.\n\nThis type of weapon is designed to be detonated at a high altitude and it can generate powerful electromagnetic pulses that can destroy electronic and electrical devices on the ground.\n\n\"(The JCS) designated 55 locations as command facilities in response to EMP threats, and 18 places completed securing such capabilities or have been going through a related process,\" the JCS said, adding that it will push to bring forward the date of its full completion from 2051 to 2039.\n\n(Image: DigitalGlobe via Getty Images)\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un decided to shut the nation's only nuclear test site last year in May, ahead of an expected meeting with Donald Trump on June 12.\n\nThe site, under Mount Mantap in the north-eastern interior of the country, was the location where all of the country's six nuclear tests were conducted.\n\nThe most recent one took place in September 2017, when Pyongyang claimed to have tested a hydrogen bomb and caused a 6.3 magnitude earthquake that was felt across the border in China, The Guardian reports.", "description": "The country demolished the site last year to show its commitment to denuclearisation", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Digitalglobe Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536078.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Punggye-ri.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
