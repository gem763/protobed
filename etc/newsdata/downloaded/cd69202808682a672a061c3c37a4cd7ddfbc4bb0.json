REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Thursday sought to calm savers worried that the ever-lengthening period of low interest rates in the euro zone could see them paying negative interest on their deposits.\n\nThe ECB on Thursday promised an indefinite supply of fresh asset purchases and cut interest rates deeper into negative territory as it tries to prop up the ailing euro zone economy.\n\n\u201cMost contracts that customers have with their banks do not currently allow such penalty rates, so the problem is not acute,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cBanks\u2019 boards are wise enough to grasp what they would trigger with such penalty rates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think private customers in Germany need to reckon with negative interest rates across the board. We are monitoring the situation and are considering our options to act,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Bundesbank board member Joachim Wuermeling struck a different tone. \u201cBanks could soon pass on lower interest rates to even more customers,\u201d Wuermeling told Focus magazine.\n\nNobody should be surprised if banks demanded higher fees and were mulling negative interest rates, Wuermeling said. \u201cIt may be necessary from a business and banking supervisory point of view,\u201d he added.", "description": "German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Thursday sought to calm savers worried that the ever-lengthening period of low interest rates in the euro zone could see them paying negative interest on their deposits.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428997203&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0IT", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
