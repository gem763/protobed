A woman found the video on the ground.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cHad the citizen not called us after she found the video card, we would not have been able to solve this crime as quickly as we did,\u201d Anchorage Police Department spokesman MJ Thim told KTVA.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSmith was arrested Tuesday and charged with first-degree murder. He appeared in court Wednesday, and a judge set his bail at a combined $750,000 cash bond, the Anchorage Daily News reported. It is not clear whether Smith has an attorney.\n\nAuthorities learned about the memory card on Sept. 30, when the woman called to report a disturbing discovery, according to KTUU. The storage device she had picked up off the street contained footage of a brutal killing, she said.\n\nWhen investigators looked into the files, they found 39 photos and 12 videos that allegedly show a naked woman with long dark hair, who appears to be a native Alaskan, being assaulted and strangled by a man in a hotel room, the Daily News reported, citing an arrest affidavit. Police said the SD card was labeled \u201cHomicide at midtown Marriott.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe man could be seen on video laughing as he choked the woman, at one point even stepping on her throat, the affidavit said. In another clip, he yelled at the woman to \u201cjust \u2026 die,\u201d speaking in what sounded like a foreign accent, according to police documents. The woman fought back, \u201cattempting to scratch at the man\u2019s wrist with her right hand to get him to stop,\u201d authorities said. But her efforts were futile.\n\nIn photos, the battered woman was shown lying on the carpeted floor, her left eye bruised and swollen shut, documents said. Her lips were bloodied and blue and she had red marks on her neck, police said. Time stamps indicated that the images from the hotel room were taken early Sept. 4, starting about 1 a.m.\n\nA couple of hours later, the pictures documented a different scene. The photos showed the hotel parking lot and the woman was on a rolling luggage cart, her body wrapped in a white blanket, according to the affidavit. The final images, time-stamped in the early-morning hours of Sept. 6, showed the woman\u2019s body facedown in the bed of a pickup truck.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWith the SD card, one of the first questions that detectives had to answer was \u2018Was this staged, or did this really happen?\u2019 \u201d Thim told Alaska Public Media on Wednesday. \u201cWhen they were able to determine that this was an actual crime, then the investigation started to quickly speed up.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 2, two days after police obtained the memory card, human remains were found about 20 miles south of Anchorage along the Seward Highway. Police said Wednesday that they think the body is that of the woman from the hotel, but are still working to figure out her identity and cause of death.\n\nMeanwhile, detectives reviewing the gruesome footage recognized the man\u2019s accent, the Associated Press reported. It sounded like Smith, whom they had crossed paths with during another investigation, according to the AP. Authorities said Smith is originally from South Africa, adding that he allegedly shot the photos and video himself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before more evidence against Smith started piling up, the affidavit said.\n\nHotel records revealed that Smith had been registered to a room at the TownePlace Suites by Marriott in Anchorage from Sept. 2 through Sept. 4, documents said. Police noted that the carpet in the footage on the memory card is the same as the hotel\u2019s flooring.\n\nSmith also owns a black pickup truck that matches the one the woman was last seen in, and cellphone records put him near where the woman\u2019s body was discovered within minutes of the final photo\u2019s time stamp, authorities said.\n\nSmith was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, according to the release. Thim told KTUU that Smith had been returning to Anchorage.\n\nOn Wednesday, police praised the woman who alerted them to the memory card.\n\n\u201cThe Anchorage Police Department extends its gratitude to the citizen who stepped forward with the evidence of this crime,\u201d the release said. \u201cThey played an instrumental role in making sure Smith will be held accountable for his actions. This serves as another example of when you see something suspicious, say something.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "A memory card contained 39 photos and 12 videos that appeared to show a naked woman with long dark hair being assaulted and strangled by a man in a hotel room, Anchorage police said.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YUh2clLzQeuKvCzHMqewR3dgysY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KNO2MTHK54I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
