(Jeff Roberson/AP)\n\nLast year, income inequality in the United States reached its highest level since the Census Bureau started tracking it in 1967, according to federal data released Thursday.\n\nIn the midst of the longest economic expansion the United States has ever seen, with poverty and unemployment rates at historic lows, the separation between rich and poor from 2017 and 2018 was greater than it has ever been, federal data show.\n\nNine states saw spikes in that divide: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Virginia.\n\nThe gulf is starkest in wealthy coastal areas such as Washington, D.C., New York, Connecticut and California, as well as in areas with widespread poverty, such as Puerto Rico and Louisiana. Equality was highest in Utah, Alaska and Iowa.\n\n[More Americans go without health coverage despite strong economy, Census Bureau finds]\n\nThe Gini index measures wealth distribution across a population, with zero representing total equality and 1 representing total inequality, where all wealth is concentrated in a single household. The indicator has been rising steadily during the past several decades. When the Census Bureau began studying income inequality more than 50 years ago, the Gini index was 0.397. In 2018, the Gini index rose to 0.485.\n\nBy comparison, no European country had a Gini index greater than 0.38 between 2017 and 2018.\n\nRecent economic gains by lower-income workers who have found jobs and benefited from minimum-wage increases in many states have not been enough to close the long-running trend of the wealthy seeing far larger income growth than middle- or lower-income earners. The number of families earning $15,000 or less has fallen since 2007, according to the latest census data, while the number of households bringing in $250,000 a year or more has grown more than 15 percent.\n\nThere should be no billionaires.

This week, Sanders announced his plan for a wealth tax as high as 8 percent on the ultrawealthy, which would raise $4.35 trillion over a decade, according to analysis by economists who consulted with the Warren and Sanders campaigns.\n\n\u201cThere should be no billionaires,\u201d Sanders tweeted to announce his plan. \u201cWe are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people.\u201d", "description": "Amid the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, the gap between the country's wealthiest and poorest has never been bigger.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "September At Am", "Taylor Telford Is A Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SWKFZ7HTO7KveL_3op425gYcy2A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3YOKJHACMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
