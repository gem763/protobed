He couldn't face the humiliation that was waiting on him when he got to school on Monday, so he shot and killed himself.\"\n\nJust before his suicide, Channing took to Instagram to share a final post, writing, \"I really hate how I can\u2019t trust anyone because those I did were so fake,\" according to the New York Times. His father found him dead in his room around 4 a.m. the following morning.\n\nSmith took to Facebook to share an emotional plea after he learned of his brother's death, asking parents to have open discussions with their children to prevent similar tragedies.\n\n\"Parents... please have difficult conversations with your kids. I know I did. My wife and I told my son that if he turns out to be gay we would love him no matter what,\" Smith wrote. \"This was a conversation that I never dreamed of having or posting about on social media. However... I refuse to allow Channing\u2019s death to pass by without justice and positivity manifesting from his grave.\"\n\n\"Being gay shouldn't be a death sentence,\" he added. \"Nobody deserves to die as they are figuring their way through this complex journey called life.\"\n\nSmith has been a vocal critic of both his brother's high school and local authorities in their handling of the tragedy.\n\nHe claims administrators at Coffee County Central High School failed to mention Channing's death on the school's website or social media accounts, or even reach out to the family to offer condolences.\n\n\"I'm beyond disappointed, to say the least,\" he told CNN.\n\nIn response, Charles Lawson, director of Coffee County Schools, said the district \"is not at liberty to make any statements concerning the matter at this time,\" and reassured that \"counseling was provided at the school for students and staff who were struggling with what occurred.\"\n\nCoffee County district attorney Craig Northcott spoke out after Smith accused officials of inaction for failing to bring criminal charges in the case, assuring the public that his office is investigating Channing's death.\n\n\"I, like the rest of the community, am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of the young life of Channing Smith,\" Northcott said in a statement. \u201cMy office has encouraged, cooperated in and supported the investigation into the events leading to this death. Ethically, I am prohibited from commenting on an open investigation or prosecution.\"\n\n\"When all relevant facts are available, my office will advise the Coffee County Sheriff\u2019s Department on what charges, if any, we believe are appropriate to help guide it in that decision,\" he added. \"Any report that my office has failed or refused to act is inaccurate and I wanted to clarify this for the sake of the Smith family as they do not need the added burden to the already incomprehensible pain that they are experiencing.\"", "description": "A 16-year-old boy\u00a0took his own life last week after\u00a0two of his classmates\u00a0shared his intimate text messages on social media.", "authors": ["Alex Lasker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RB.Oj._MJkbJayyFCUqG9A--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/720x472+0+247/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d094d2e0-e458-11e9-aeff-1983bd7b00d6", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
