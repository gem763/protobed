WARNING. THIS YARN IS NOT SAFE FOR WORK. NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST. PROCEED WITH CAUTION.\n\nAhh, the internet. It\u2019s a real mixed bag. On the one hand, the wealth of all human knowledge is available at your fingertips, you can stay in touch with friends around the world, and Netflix is a thing. On the other hand\u2026\n\nWell, on the other hand it provides a platform on which absolute deviants can publish the fruits of their perversion in the least likely of places. Like, say, Google Maps\u2018 Street View.\n\nREAD MORE Mother & Daughter Show Off Their Beautiful Relationship With Matching Tattoos\n\nWhat am I talking about, you say? Who could be diabolical enough to pervert the goodness and innocence of one of the internet\u2019s truly useful tools? Where is this happening? What\u2019s going on?\n\nIf you\u2019re really interested \u2013 and you have no bosses looking over your shoulder, and you\u2019re not in public, and your family members are not in the room \u2013 then please, friend, follow these steps to find the ghoulish treasure ye seek:\n\nType \u2018Pussy France\u2019 into Google Maps Go to street view Turn left I\u2019M SORRY\n\nYes, that is an aggressively average-looking man wearing an ugly cap, a sock tan, and nothing else. Yes, he does appear to have taken the photo \u2013 the one that appears on Google\u2019s official Street View of Pussy, Savoie, France, a small village notable for not much beyond a snicker-worthy name \u2013 with a selfie stick. Yes, his hog is completely out, and in the immortal words of a colleague, \u201cfully torqued\u201d.\n\nREAD MORE A Painting Of Channing Tatum With His Giant Ballsack Out Just Sold For $9,700\n\nAnd no, we have no fucking idea where this originated. It seems to have popped up around two days ago and is spreading across the internet \u2013 via Reddit and YouTube, obviously. Your guess is as good as ours.\n\nAnd guess we must! Who is this man?! Why is he so cheerful about getting his plonker onto the world wide web, attached to his buffoonish face, no less? How did he manage to dupe the Google Street View camera into capturing said plonker \u2013 especially considering pretty much everyone else who features on the Street View pics has their faces blurred out?\n\nMy frontrunning theory: a former Google employee, disgruntled with his severance package, uses it all on a trip to Pussy, France where he puts his skills to work at wreaking havoc on this otherwise pristine corner of the internet. Abandon hope, friends. We\u2019re living in his world now.
