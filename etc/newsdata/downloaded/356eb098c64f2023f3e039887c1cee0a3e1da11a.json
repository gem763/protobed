Elizabeth Warren would understand.\n\nShe wants to be the Democrats\u2019 2020 nominee, but doesn\u2019t necessarily want to be the front-runner, at least not yet. She\u2019d rather watch Joe Biden have the honor \u2014 and the target on his back.\n\nBiden will once again be the \u00adpi\u00f1ata at Thursday\u2019s debate because the best way for any of his nine rivals to gain ground is to beat up on him, as Sen. Kamala Harris proved in the first debate.\n\nBut Warren is the one to watch this time. Most national polls have her second, with two recent ones showing her trailing the former vice president by just four points.\n\nShe is drawing by far the largest crowds and is focused, energized and organized. Biden, on the other hand, had a terrible week, with a growing realization in the party that his flubs and memory lapses are not passing problems.\n\nBoth his blood-filled eye and his gibberish remarks about climate change added to doubts he can go the distance. His team wants to cut back on his schedule and lowered expectations for Iowa and New Hampshire, moves that smell like panic.\n\nThe only surprise to me is that the cracks in his game are so obvious just four months after he entered. I assumed the aura of inevitability that greeted Biden\u2019s candidacy would carry him through this year, with the left-wing media glossing over his problems in their desire to defeat President Trump.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s weaknesses are so blatant that the party\u2019s top propaganda outlets, The New York Times and The Washington Post, gave front-page play to critical articles. That amounts to a five-alarm fire.\n\nMost surprising, David Axelrod, the 2008-campaign guru who helped put Barack Obama and Biden into the White House, has become a fierce critic of Biden.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have a well-earned rep for goofy, harmless gaffes. It\u2019s another if you serially distort your own record. @JoeBiden is in danger of creating a more damaging meme,\u201d Axelrod tweeted Friday. He was reacting to a Biden claim that he never favored the Iraq war, even though he voted to give President George W. Bush authority for the 2003 invasion and turned against it only when the war went south.\n\nNow that more voters will be paying more attention, Biden likely will pay a bigger price for poor performances. And because Warren is a much better debater than he is, and because others also will be gunning for him, don\u2019t be shocked if Thursday\u2019s showdown upends the race and she soon emerges as the front-runner.\n\nAt which point, Dems will have a new problem: The whiff of anti-Americanism in many of the candidates\u2019 policies will become more pronounced without Biden at the top. Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders are especially guilty of making sweeping condemnations of the shape and structure of contemporary society.\n\nIndeed, they and their fellow candidates want such radical changes that it\u2019s hard to figure out what, if anything, they like about America.\n\nA little background. After Trump\u2019s election, Washington Dems started with the resistance, then morphed into a soft secessionism, with some boycotting Trump\u2019s inauguration and State of the Union speeches.\n\nSince they took the House in 2018, a growing list of members declared their intent to impeach the president even though they have not identified clear offenses. Although special counsel Robert Mueller suggested no charges, many Dems refuse to accept Trump as the legitimate president.\n\nStill, these departures from political norms largely reflected a blind hatred for one man. As destructive as that is, something different \u2014 and worse \u2014 is happening now.\n\nThe 2020 candidates and their supporters appear to be as angry at America as they are at Trump. They express contempt for our history and act as if everything about our country is so polluted that we must smash the existing order and start over.\n\nAs a result, nearly all the candidates are espousing ideas that are so far out of the mainstream that they sound more like calls for \u00adrevolution than reform.\n\nAbolish the Electoral College is one example, pack the Supreme Court is another. Opening the borders and giving free health care to illegal immigrants, ideas that were fringe four years ago, are now \u00adbasic requirements for all Dems.\n\nOther bizarre policies include Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, wealth taxes and reparations for the descendants of slaves. Each has found support.\n\nThe impact of these plans would be profound, both in price and how they would change the way millions upon millions of Americans live and work.\n\nConsider that Medicare for All would outlaw private insurance plans that now cover about 150 million people, most of them job-related. Both Warren and Sanders support the idea, and several others say that a single-payer government system is the ultimate goal.\n\nSanders said his plan would cost between $30 and $40 trillion over a decade, though he argues poor families could save over current costs.\n\nBiden, by comparison, rejects the notion of a health-care reboot, saying fixing ObamaCare would be better and cheaper.\n\nSimilarly, the Green New Deal aims to radically transform the nation\u2019s energy landscape by retrofitting every building to meet draconian standards. The apocalyptic language comes with a matching price tag of up to $93 trillion over a decade, or more than $600,000 per household, according to one estimate.\n\nSanders, Harris and Beto O\u2019Rourke all subscribe to the hysteria, while Warren offers her own plan to spend $2 trillion over 10 years to create a green industrial policy.\n\n\u201cThe climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world,\u201d Warren said during CNN\u2019s seven-hour slog on the issue. She believes \u201cwe have 11 years\u201d to cut emissions in half and supports a ban on natural gas fracking. She also wants to phase out nuclear energy, which supplies 20 percent of the country\u2019s electricity.\n\nYet Warren saves her greatest zealotry for a war on corporations. For starters, she wants to raise their taxes, let employees pick 40 percent of directors, restrict executives\u2019 pay and give Washington more power by requiring a federal charter. She says all this despite the fact that an estimated 50 million people work for large corporations.\n\nIn short, she doesn\u2019t just want Trump\u2019s job. She wants the power to transform American life in ways that could be the death knell for millions of other people\u2019s jobs, too.\n\nBetraying the blue\n\nRetired NYPD Sgt.

Raising taxes is always his first instinct, so why should robots be different?", "description": "She wants to be the Democrats\u2019 2020 nominee, but doesn\u2019t necessarily want to be the front-runner, at least not yet.
