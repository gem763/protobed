They are not special forces or SDF.\" (Reporting by Tom Perry Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "description": "Kurdish-led security forces do not have enough guards for the Ain Issa camp that holds families of Islamic State militants and dozens of them have escaped since Turkish shelling struck the area, an official with the Syrian Democratic Forces said.
