The company says the Lafayette blazes did not begin in areas designated as high risk for wildfire.\n\nPG&E is under severe financial pressure after its equipment has been blamed for a series of destructive wildfires in Northern California over the past three years.", "description": "Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said Monday its power lines may have started two wildfires over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/gettyfire1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
