Fitch Affirms HT Global at 'BB-'; Outlook Stable\n\n(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Singapore/Hong Kong-October 10: Fitch Ratings has affirmed HT Global IT Solutions Holdings Limited's Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BB-'. The Outlook is Stable. Simultaneously, the agency has affirmed the 'BB-' rating on its USD368 million 7% senior secured notes due 2021. HT Global's ratings reflect the robust free cash flow (FCF) that its 63%-owned subsidiary, Hexaware Technologies (NS: ) Limited, will continue to generate, supported by above-industry average growth. HT Global's credit profile benefits from its mid-tier market position, solid customer base and revenue diversified by industry. We assess the linkages between HT Global and Hexaware as 'weak parent, strong subsidiary with strong overall linkages' under Fitch's parent and subsidiary methodology. HT Global has a controlling interest in India-based Hexaware and is able to exert significant influence over the subsidiary's business, including voting at shareholders' meetings, election of directors, timing of dividend payments and other distributions, M&As and overall strategic and investment decisions. Therefore, we rate HT Global's credit profile by proportionately consolidating 63% of Hexaware's financials. The senior notes are rated in line with HT Global's Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR as they represent its direct, unconditional, secured and unsubordinated obligations. The notes' rating will move in line with HT Global's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS Acquisition Lowers Rating Headroom: Hexaware's acquisition of 100% of US-based Mobiquity Inc. has lowered HT Global's rating headroom. We forecast HT Global's 2019 proportionate consolidated FFO adjusted net leverage will deteriorate to around 5.0x, the negative threshold above which Fitch would take negative rating action. HT Global's ability to take on additional debt is constrained by the limited headroom on its consolidated leverage of 3.2x, relative to the incurrence covenant of 3.3x in its bond documents. Management does not intend to issue additional debt in the next 12-24 months. However, we expect leverage to improve to around 4.4x-4.7x in 2020, supported by annual FCF generation of around USD25 million-30 million, led by steady growth in revenue. Hexaware acquired Mobiquity for a cash consideration of USD182 million - USD132 million in 2019, and the balance in 2020, part of which is contingent on earn-outs. The acquisition is funded by debt of USD46 million at Hexaware and the balance through cash and internal cash generation. Mobiquity provides digital solutions to customers such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Inc. (A+/Positive), Rabobank and Philips Industries Inc. FCF Usage Drives Ratings: HT Global's leverage is largely driven by the returns desired by its private equity parent, Baring Private Equity Asia. Leverage remains high relative to industry peers as its owners have extracted cash through dividends in addition to selling down stakes. HT Global has the potential to deleverage as Hexaware is strongly cash generative. However, its owners' desire for cash returns may limit the pace of deleveraging, although we do not expect higher shareholder returns to threaten the 'BB-' ratings. Improving Customer Concentration: HT Global's business-risk profile is supported by moderate-to-high costs for its customers to switch to competitors, diversified revenue in terms of products and industries served and a profitable niche serving a solid customer base. However, it lacks scale and some technological capability relative to larger IT peers. Customer concentration remains high, but has improved as the contribution from top-five and top-10 customers has fallen to 37% and 46% in 2Q19, respectively (2Q18: 42% and 52%). The client concentration risk is also mitigated by the company's established relationships, with no loss of customer among the top-20 clients in the last decade, and high revenue visibility with about 95% of revenue derived from repeat customers. Strong Growth to Continue: We forecast 2019 revenue to rise by around 21%-23% in Indian rupee terms, better than the industry average, driven by organic growth of 12%-13% and pro forma 12-month consolidation of Mobiquity's financials. We expect the revenue growth to be mainly driven by new orders in infrastructure-management services and the healthcare business, despite some softness in the banking and financial segment. We expect Mobiquity's revenue to rise by around 20%-25% annually, driven by expanding business from both existing and new customers. Mobiquity's revenue had a CAGR of 24% in the last three years to USD70 million in 2018. Stable Profitability: We forecast HT Global's operating EBITDAR margin to narrow slightly to around 16.5%-17% (2018: 17.4%) on Mobiquity's slightly lower margin than Hexaware's 17%-18%. Higher employee utilisation, flat billing rates and cost savings are likely to offset elevated staff costs and higher H1B US working-visa fees. We expect profitability to also be supported by our forecast of a drop in the attrition rate from 18% in 2Q19 to normal levels of around 14%-15% (2Q18: 14%), while employee utilisation rates will remain stable at around 80% levels. IDR Drives Senior Note Rating: The senior notes are secured by Baring's 100% equity stake in HT Global. Debt at Hexaware of USD46 million is structurally superior to HT Global's bond as the parent relies completely on dividends from Hexaware to service its debt. However, the level of prior-ranking debt/EBITDA is 0.4x - significantly less than the 2.0x-2.5x threshold at which we would start to consider notching HT Global's bond down for structural subordination. In addition, we expect Hexaware to be in a net cash position in 12-18 months thanks to its strong FCF generation. Stable Outlook for 2019-2020: We expect India's USD165 billion IT software and service industry to expand by about mid-to-high single-digit percentages annually during 2019-2020, driven by digital solutions despite slower growth in the banking and financing industry. Rising adoption of automated platforms continues to be a threat, which could dilute the labour arbitrage advantage over international peers, hurt profitability and lead to market share loss to innovators. We do not expect a complete H1B visa ban or major restrictions on outsourcing from the US. Most industry participants continue to hire or operate locally in response to the restrictions. DERIVATION SUMMARY HT Global's 'BB-' IDR is constrained by its high 2019 forecast FFO adjusted net leverage of 5.0x and aggressive financial profile as its private equity owner, Baring, has steadily extracted cash in the form of dividends or through stake sales. HT Global's business profile is weaker than that of Marble II Pte. Ltd. (BB/Stable) as Marble benefits from a larger revenue base and minimum guaranteed revenue of USD990 million until 2021 with Hewlett Packard Group, which provides some visibility in revenue generation. However, the gap between the two in terms of business profile is narrowing as HT Global improved its scale with the Mobiquity acquisition and also reduced its customer concentration risk relative to Marble. HT Global's financial risk profile is also weaker as its 2019 forecast FFO adjusted net leverage is higher than Marble's 2019 forecast FFO adjusted net leverage of around 3.9x-4.0x. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer -\n\nRevenue growth of around 21%-23% in 2019 assuming full 12-month consolidation of Mobiquity -\n\nSlightly lower operating EBITDA margin of around 16.5%-17% (2018: 17.4%) in 2019-2020 -\n\nCapex/revenue of around 1%-2% during 2019-2020 -\n\nEffective tax rate of around 18%-19% (2018: 20%) during 2019-2020 -\n\nHexaware to pay USD50 million for Mobiquity's deferred acquisition payment in 2020 -\n\nM&A of about USD16 million (USD25 million at Hexaware) each year starting 2021 RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - An improvement in proportionally consolidated FFO adjusted net leverage to below 3.5x, although we believe this is unlikely as shareholders may prioritise cash returns. - An improvement in Hexaware's market position. - Growth in Hexaware's FCF to over USD75 million (2019 Fitch forecast: USD25 million-30 million). Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action Higher-than-Fitch-expected shareholder returns, greater competition or loss of key customers leading to deterioration in proportionally consolidated FFO adjusted net leverage to above 5.0x on a sustained basis (2019 forecast: 5.0x) LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: HT Global's liquidity was adequate at end-June 2019, with a standalone cash balance of USD17 million and no near-term debt maturities. HT Global also had USD26 million in its interest-reserve account to service its bond. The company needs to maintain one year's worth of coupon in the interest-reserve account, as required by bond documents. Hexaware had net cash of USD1 million only at end-June 2019 after it raised USD20 million from a term loan and USD4 million in working-capital lines and used USD108 million in cash to pay part of the USD132 million for the Mobiquity acquisition.
