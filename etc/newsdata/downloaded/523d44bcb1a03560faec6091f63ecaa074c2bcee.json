Some particularly thick custards will use only heavy cream as the dairy element, but most classic recipes call for a combination of whole milk and heavy cream to balance the richness of the egg yolks. The eggs act as emulsifiers, giving this style a velvety feel and warding off ice crystals. And you can adjust the amount of egg to suit your taste: Less will result in a lighter base, more will make it luscious and very creamy. A classic ratio is 2 egg yolks for every cup of dairy. First, you\u2019ll need to temper the base: Heat the cream-milk mixture in a saucepan over medium heat until it is hot enough to melt the sugar, but not at the point of boiling. Once it\u2019s there, add a small amount of the mixture to the beaten yolks, whisking them constantly as you pour. This raises their temperature, making them less likely to curdle when added to the hot dairy. Pour the warmed yolks into the dairy mixture and stir over low heat, paying attention to the bottom and sides of the pot, which are often hotter than the center and more likely to overheat. Use a wooden spoon or a heatproof spatula to stir the custard as it thickens, but don\u2019t use a whisk. Whisking holds the risk of beating too much air into your custard. If that happens, the mixture will become too frothy, and you won\u2019t be able to tell when it has thickened. The froth also interferes with a slow, steady cooking. The custard is ready when it\u2019s thick enough to coat the spoon you\u2019re using. (You\u2019ll want to use a wooden or regular spoon: It\u2019s more dependable, especially if your spatula is nonstick, which may let the custard run right off.) The custard should leave a visible stripe when you run your finger through it, and the mixture should reach 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. When it has thickened, immediately strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve to remove any bits that might have curdled. Recipe: Classic Custard Ice Cream\n\nPhiladelphia-Style (Eggless) An eggless base, often referred to as Philadelphia-style or American-style ice cream, lacks the added fat of egg yolks, making it lighter than a custard. Their absence makes the base easier to prepare, and, without the eggy heaviness, lets any added flavorings shine through. But there is a downside to leaving out the yolks: This style can freeze rock solid and develop ice crystals. To improve the texture, many recipes call for adding liquid sugar and a small amount of alcohol, both of which deter ice crystals and help keep the ice cream from freezing into something unscoopable. Recipe: Philadelphia-Style Ice Cream\n\nNondairy Making ice cream without traditional dairy is tricky because of the fat content and flavor of alternative milks. Almond milk, which has the mildest flavor of all nut milks, doesn\u2019t have enough fat to make an ice cream truly creamy. Coconut cream has a wonderfully high fat content, but using it alone will lend an obvious coconut flavor. This all-purpose base uses a formula that is part coconut cream and part cashew or hemp milk. Both milks are relatively mild and high in fat, and both blend well into an ice cream base. Of the two, hemp milk, which has a slightly higher fat content, is preferable, though it can be hard to find. Feel free to use either in our recipe. When shopping for coconut cream, which is generally sold in cans, note that it is higher in fat than coconut milk. If you can\u2019t find it, substitute full-fat coconut milk (but not low-fat coconut milk). Never use coconut nondairy creamers, which are full of additives that can muddy the flavor. Recipe: Nondairy Ice Cream", "description": "Without ice cream, summer wouldn\u2019t be nearly as sweet, and nothing compares to the homemade kind. Not only is it better tasting and textured, it\u2019s also endlessly customizable. You can control the flavors and sugar content, swap in nut milks, increase the number of eggs or lose them altogether. And best of all, it\u2019s not that difficult to make. We\u2019ll walk through four essential base recipes, prime for customization \u2014 custard, Philadelphia-style, nondairy and no-churn \u2014 and look at flavorings, mix-ins and toppings, to elevate how you make a summer favorite.", "authors": ["Melissa Clark", "A Guide", "Julia Moskin", "Kay Rentschler", "Sam Sifton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/12/dining/00Icecream12/00Icecream12-superJumbo.jpg"}
