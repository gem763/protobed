(https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm)\n\nA spokesman, Keith New, said James' allegations had no merit, and PHEAA intended to vigorously defend itself.\n\nHe also said PHEAA has cooperated with many regulators to address borrower concerns, and James rebuffed its offers to meet after threatening to sue.\n\nJames accused PHEAA of fraud, and violating the federal Dodd-Frank finance law through its abusive practices.\n\nHer lawsuit came two years after Massachusetts sued PHEAA for mistreating borrowers, and on the heels of litigation by borrowers themselves.\n\nIt also followed a report in February from the U.S. Department of Education's inspector general which criticized that agency for not taking action against PHEAA and other servicers for their mistakes.\n\nThe report said that in calls with borrowers that department employees monitored in April and May 2017, PHEAA's \"fail\" rates were 10.6% and 8.8%, higher than any other servicer and more than double the respective monthly averages.\n\nIn March 2018, the Education Department issued guidance that states should not be regulating federal student loan servicers.\n\nPHEAA is a quasi-governmental agency created in 1963 by Pennsylvania's general assembly.\n\nIn August, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau named Robert Cameron, a former top PHEAA compliance official, as its private education loan ombudsman, or industry watchdog.\n\nThe case is New York v. Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Authority, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-09155.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Richard Chang)", "description": "New York state on Thursday sued one of the largest federal student loan servicers, whose practices the U.S. government singled out for criticism earlier this year, saying it abusively treated borrowers working in lower-paying public service jobs.
