(AP) - Contentious proposals to reintroduce grizzly bears to the North Cascades ecosystem in Washington state are once again open for public comment.\n\nThe plan, drafted by the National Park Service and U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife, drew mixed responses from locals in 2017 with over 126,000 comments, the Daily Herald reported .\n\nIt includes four options for grizzly bear recovery. Three would bring bears in from Montana or British Columbia to bolster the local population. The goal would be to reach 200 bears.\n\nA fourth proposal calls for continuing current efforts to keep habitat healthy.\n\nWork on the proposals was halted by the Trump administration in December of 2017.\n\nThen-Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke ordered work stop on a key planning document - the environmental impact statement for the grizzly restoration project. He then restarted that work in 2018.\n\nThe document is available for review and comment online. The comment period ends Oct. 24.\n\nGrizzlies were listed as a threatened species in the U.S. in 1975 and as endangered in Washington in 1980. Now, scientists don\u2019t have enough evidence to say there is any population in the North Cascades.\n\nKevin Ashe, a councilmember in the North Cascades town of Darrington, said his stance against bringing grizzlies back into the North Cascades hasn\u2019t changed. He fears what bringing more bears into the ecosystem would mean for outdoor recreation and logging, which are large economic drivers for the area.\n\nIf a bear wandered onto a trail or into a logging area, he worries those places could be closed.\n\nJoe Scott, the international programs director with Conservation Northwest, said that\u2019s unlikely to happen.\n\n\u201cOnce this process is underway I don\u2019t think people will see any changes to their lives as we know them,\u201d he said.\n\nEach option in the draft plan takes a different approach to grizzly bear recovery in the North Cascades.\n\nThe first suggests bringing up to 10 grizzlies from Montana or British Columbia and releasing them in a remote location over the course of two summers. They would be monitored for two years before officials decide whether to bring in more bears.\n\nThe second option would release five to seven bears at multiple sites each year for up to 10 years, or until the population reaches 25 grizzlies.\n\nExperts say those plans could help the population reach 200 bears in 60 to 100 years.\n\nThe third possibility calls for releasing five to seven bears each year, at different locations, until the goal of 200 is reached through releases and births. It would take an estimated 25 years and may require relocating up to 168 bears during that time.\n\nThe relocation options would cost between $6 million and $8.5 million over 20 to 25 years.\n\nThe area covers about 9,800 square miles (25,382 square kilometers) in Washington and 3,800 square miles (9,842 square kilometers) in British Columbia.\n\nThe last verified grizzly on the U.S. side of the border was in 1996, and the last verified reproduction in 1991.\n\nThe North Cascades are one of six zones identified by federal officials as locations for grizzly recovery. So far, Yellowstone and north central Montana have seen growth.\n\nToday, Scott said there are probably 700 grizzly bears in Yellowstone.\n\n\u201cClearly, grizzly bears and humans coexist there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe grizzly population in the North Cascades is entirely isolated from other reproducing groups, so it won\u2019t ever recover on its own, Scott said.\n\nIf grizzlies are brought to the Cascades, it will be the only population outside of the Rockies, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important from a species standpoint to have more distribution of the animal in case of disease breakouts or ecological disasters,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Herald, http://www.heraldnet.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Contentious proposals to reintroduce grizzly bears to the North Cascades ecosystem in Washington state are once again open for public comment.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
