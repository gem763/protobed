It could be eroded if accidents were to occur, he said.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe Land Transport Authority said that the expansion was in response to industry feedback for a more varied testing environment, and gives companies the chance \"to progressively conduct on-road testing in a wider range of traffic scenarios and road conditions\".\n\n\"This will support the robust testing of AVs' capabilities to provide inter-town services and longer-haul journeys in a safe manner, and pave the way for the planned pilot deployment of AVs in the early 2020s,\" it added.\n\nIn 2017, the Government identified Punggol, Tengah and the Jurong Innovation District as areas where residents and workers can take self-driving buses and shuttles for their first- and last-mile commutes, under a pilot programme.\n\n\"LTA will engage local grassroots and community leaders ahead of time if there are plans to conduct AV trials in their specific constituencies,\" the LTA said on Thursday.\n\nAll AVs will have to display prominent decals and have markings to ensure easy identification by other road users.\n\nThey will have to go through a thorough safety assessment before they are approved for on-road trials.\n\nIn addition, they must continue to have a qualified safety driver \"who is ready to take over immediate control of the vehicle should the need arise\".\n\nThey must also be covered by third-party liability insurance.\n\nFurther expansion of trials will be permitted after the AVs pass stringent competency tests, said the LTA.\n\nThe LTA started facilitating on-road AV trials in 2015.\n\nCurrent test sites include Buona Vista, Jurong Island and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in western Singapore, as well as Sentosa.\n\nGroups that have been testing the AVs include ComfortDelGro, ST Engineering and NTU.\n\nAt the opening ceremony of the Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress on Monday, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said AVs have the potential to transform urban mobility and improve living environments.\n\n\"I look forward to a larger-scale adoption of AV technology in Singapore, but I think this will not be in the near future,\" he said.\n\n\"New infrastructure and enablers, such as dedicated lanes and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications technology, will be important before we can scale up the use of AVs.\"\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - SELF-DRIVING vehicles will be tested on public roads in neighbourhoods such as Bukit Timah, Clementi and Jurong\u00a0as the trial of autonomous vehicles (AVs) expands to cover all of western Singapore. .
