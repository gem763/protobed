Martin Levy figured out that a common technique used for training animals called operant learning - or clicker training - can be used to make better surgeons.\n\nIn short, a mechanical device that emits an audible click is used to reinforce positive behavior.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite the same as giving a doctor a treat and a pat on the head, but it still works, said Pryor, a scientist, writer and animal trainer who has been using the technique for decades.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, experienced surgeons will train the younger surgeons and they make it quite hard,\u201d which leads to tension and fear of failure, she said.\n\n\u201cWith our method, they learned to use the tools with great confidence and calmness and turned them into calm, pleasant, serene people,\u201d she said.\n\nThe study published in 2015 by the journal Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research found that surgeons trained using the clicker method performed surgical procedures with better precision.\n\nThe awards at the 29th annual ceremony at Harvard University were handed out by real Nobel laureates, and as has become the tradition, featured the world premiere of a mini opera titled \u201cCreatures of Habit.\u201d\n\nThe winners received $10 trillion Zimbabwean dollars, which is virtually worthless, and each was given one minute to deliver an acceptance speech enforced by an 8-year-old girl whining \u201cPlease stop. I\u2019m bored.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s shenanigans also included a tribute to Nobel Prize-winning physicist Roy Glauber, known for his humbleness and sense of humor, who for years attended the Ig Nobel ceremony and always helped sweep up afterward. He died in December at age 93.\n\nAndreas Voss and his colleagues found that germophobes might want to avoid Romanian bank notes.\n\nTheir study concluded that three types of drug-resistant bacteria clung the longest to Romanian money when compared to several other international currencies, including the euro, U.S. and Canadian dollars and Indian rupees.\n\nRomanians shouldn\u2019t take offense at having the dirtiest money though.\n\nThe researchers said Romanian bank notes include a polymer fiber to discourage counterfeiting and improve durability, which allows the growth and transmission of drug resistant pathogens.\n\nVoss, a professor at Radboud University Center for Infectious Diseases, Canisius-Wilhelmina Hospital, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, has a simple solution for people squeamish about handling paper money crawling with bacteria.\n\n\u201cUse plastic and electronic payment,\u201d he said via email. \u201cActually, I hardly ever use cash anymore.\u201d\n\nSilvano Gallus won an Ig Nobel for his research that found yes, pizza is good for you. Well, maybe just pizza that\u2019s made and consumed in Italy.\n\n\u201cWe found that pizza consumption in Italy was protective for many chronic diseases that are known to be influenced by diet: digestive tract cancers and infarction,\u201d Gallus, head of the Laboratory of Lifestyle Epidemiology at the Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri in Milan, Italy said in an email.\n\nHe noted that many pizza ingredients are associated with the Mediterranean diet, which has known health benefits.\n\nLike many of the winners, Gallus, a renowned scientist, was thrilled to win an Ig Nobel.\n\n\u201cI am honored to have obtained this achievement for a bizarre but important award,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event was produced by the science humor magazine Annals of Improbable Research and co-sponsored by the Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association and the Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Training surgeons is as easy as training dolphins or dogs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Pratt"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
