REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nBill Bidwill\u2019s father, Charles Bidwill, bought the Cardinals, then in Chicago, in 1932. Bill and his brother Charles Jr. inherited the team, then in St. Louis, in 1962 before Bill purchased his brother\u2019s share in 1972. He moved the team to the Phoenix area in 1988.\n\n\u201cBill Bidwill was part of the NFL family his entire life, starting from his days as a ball boy through his time as an owner,\u201d NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement.\n\n\u2014Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen remains in the NFL concussion protocol but took part in individual drills.\n\nStill, he has yet to be cleared for full football activity. Backup Matt Barkley is preparing to play in case Allen can\u2019t on Sunday at Tennessee.\n\n\u2014New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold returned to practice but hasn\u2019t been cleared for contact as he continues his recovery from mononucleosis.\n\nCoach Adam Gase told reporters that Darnold would take part in drills with the first unit, but his status for the Sunday game at Philadelphia remains up in the air. Luke Falk will be ready to go if Darnold isn\u2019t, Gase said.\n\n\u2014Washington Redskins coach Jay Gruden admitted that the team doesn\u2019t have a plan at quarterback heading into its Sunday game against the New England Patriots.\n\nRookie Dwayne Haskins threw three interceptions in relief of Case Keenum in Washington\u2019s 24-3 loss to the New York Giants on Sunday.\n\n\u2014Chicago Bears linebacker Roquan Smith, who missed last week\u2019s win against Minnesota for personal reasons, said he will play Sunday against the Oakland Raiders in London. The news wasn\u2019t as good for quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who dislocated his left shoulder last weekend.\n\nCoach Matt Nagy said that Smith would practice but didn\u2019t guarantee he would play against Oakland, and he added Trubisky wasn\u2019t expected to play.\n\n\u2014The Patriots placed veteran kicker Stephen Gostkowski on injured reserve. ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported that Gostkowski will require season-ending surgery for a left hip injury and would be ready for the 2020 season.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that the Patriots worked out free agent kickers Wednesday, and ESPN\u2019s Mike Reiss reported that veteran Kai Forbath was among them.\n\n\u2014The Bengals placed wideout John Ross on injured reserve because of a right shoulder injury sustained during Cincinnati\u2019s Monday night loss in Pittsburgh.\n\nNo surgery was scheduled, and Ross is expected back this season, according to NFL Network. In a corresponding move, the Bengals signed rookie receiver Stanley Morgan Jr. from their practice squad.\n\n\u2014The Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 offense got two key players back at practice, as wide receiver Tyreek Hill and running back Damien Williams were both present.\n\nHill, who hadn\u2019t practiced since injuring his collarbone in Week 1, got in a limited session. Williams, who hurt his knee in Week 2 and hadn\u2019t practiced since, was a full participant. Coach Andy Reid declined to commit to either player returning Sunday night, when the Chiefs host the Colts.\n\n\u2014Giants running back Saquon Barkley, who has been recovering from a high ankle sprain, appears to be on the mend sooner than expected and was spotted on the practice field, according to multiple outlets.\n\n\u2014The Jacksonville Jaguars announced that disgruntled cornerback Jalen Ramsey was sitting out practice due to a lingering back injury. Ramsey has asked for a trade.\n\n\u2014Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Shaq Barrett sat out practice due to an ailing groin.\n\n\u2014The Green Bay Packers claimed outside linebacker Tim Williams off waivers from the Ravens. Earlier this week, Baltimore gave up on Williams, a 2017 third-round pick, after he managed only two sacks in 19 games (no starts) over three seasons.\n\n\u2014The Baltimore Ravens signed inside linebacker Josh Bynes, who was part of their 2013 Super Bowl-winning team. He will fill Tim Williams\u2019 roster spot.\n\n\u2014Cleveland Browns linebacker Christian Kirksey, on injured reserve since Sept. 21, is expected to miss the rest of the season after surgery to repair a torn pectoral tendon.\n\n\u2014Denver Broncos offensive tackle Ja\u2019Wuan James, who sustained a knee injury in the season opener and hasn\u2019t played since, returned to practice on a limited basis.\n\n\u2014Carolina Panthers wide receiver Chris Hogan landed on injured reserve due to a left knee injury he sustained last week. He will undergo arthroscopic surgery, according to general manager Marty Hurney.\n\n\u2014Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Dontrelle Inman was placed on injured reserve due to a quadriceps injury.\n\n\u2014Former NFL wide receiver Percy Harvin admitted he dealt his anxiety by self-medicating with marijuana. \u201cThere\u2019s not a game \u2014 there\u2019s not a game I played that I wasn\u2019t high,\u201d Harvin told Bleacher Report.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Bill Bidwill, the sole owner of the NFL's Cardinals franchise since 1972, died Wednesday at 88.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436488352&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9203J-OCASP"}
