REUTERS/Pierre Albouy/File Photo\n\nThe investment comes a month after Toyota and another smaller Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T), said they would take small equity stakes in each other.\n\nSuch tie-ups highlight how automakers are scrambling to chase scale, manage costs and boost development required to develop self-driving cars, electric vehicles and new mobility services which are upending the global auto industry.\n\n\u201cIn this once-in-a-century period of profound transformation, by strengthening their bonds and aligning their capabilities, Toyota and Subaru aim ... to make ever-better cars,\u201d Toyota said in a statement.\n\nTraditional car makers, especially smaller ones such as Subaru and Suzuki, are struggling to meet the fast pace of change in an industry which is shifting to a business model of providing transportation services from simply selling cars to drivers.\n\nIn a statement, Toyota, whose annual global vehicle sales are 10 times that of Subaru, said its investment would amount to up to 80 billion yen ($650 million) based on Subaru\u2019s stock market value. The smaller automaker will reciprocate by buying a stake in Toyota of equal value.\n\n\u201cThe plan appears to be to ultimately make Subaru a fully owned subsidiary, to help create a \u2018mega Toyota\u2019. This is the first step towards that,\u201d said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama. \u201cIt\u2019s all about building scale.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage With bigger stake in Subaru, Toyota expands reach over Japan automakers\n\nJOINING FORCES\n\nCar makers around the world are joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology. Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) have said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.\n\nFriday\u2019s deal cements Subaru\u2019s place in Toyota\u2019s expanding group of Japanese partners, which include Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T) and Yamaha Motor Co (7272.T).\n\nRival Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) has an alliance with France\u2019s Renault (RENA.PA), although that has been shaken following the ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn, and with Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T).\n\nHonda Motor Co (7267.T) has a tie-up with General Motors (GM.N).\n\nSubaru, which produces the Outback and Forester SUVs, is known for its horizontally placed boxer engines, along with its EyeSight autonomous driver assist and all-wheel-drive technologies.\n\nIn recent years it has departed from selling cars as high-performance machines, marketing them instead as lifestyle products using an approach which has been successful in the United States, its biggest market.\n\nThe two automakers in June said they planned to jointly develop an electric sport-utility vehicle on a platform produced together, to share costs.\n\nToyota seems to be keen on investing in smaller, domestic automakers, rather than forging cross-border tie-ups like some of its rivals.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Subaru logo is displayed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 14, 2019.

Its current 17% stake makes Toyota the biggest shareholder.\n\nToyota shares ended 0.77% lower on Friday and Subaru fell 0.74%.\n\n(Graphic: Toyota's stakeholdings in partner automakers - tmsnrt.rs/2nKhOEZ)", "description": "Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> will raise its stake in Subaru Corp <7270.T> to 20% from around 17%, the two Japanese automakers said on Friday, as they leverage their scale to better compete in developing new vehicle technologies.", "authors": ["Maki Shiraki", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434466955&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0K1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
