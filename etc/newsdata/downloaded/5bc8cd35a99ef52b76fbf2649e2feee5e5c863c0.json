Meanwhile, United have had two weeks to let their problems further manifest, rather than provide any respite. Despite United inevitably rousing themselves for such a big rivalry, Liverpool\u2019s superiority in talent, cohesion, morale and tactics will ultimately shine through.\n\nManchester United 0-3 Liverpool\n\nWhen is it?\n\nThe match kicks off at Old Trafford at 4:30pm on Sunday 20 October (BST).\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nThe match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League with coverage beginning at 3pm.\n\nOdds\n\nManchester United 4/1\n\nDraw 3/1\n\nLiverpool 4/6\n\nTeam news\n\nPogba has been ruled out as he continues to recover from an ankle injury that has derailed the start to his season, as well as Jesse Lingard who Solskjaer described as having \u201cno chance\u201d of being fit. De Gea strained a muscle adductor on international duty with Spain and is also unlikely to be available. However, Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are all in line to return to the starting eleven.\n\nThere is an outside chance Alisson may return in goal for Liverpool having stepped up his rehabilitation over the international break. Mohamed Salah is a minor doubt after sustaining an ankle injury during Liverpool\u2019s win over Leicester, but is expected to make the starting line-up. Xherdan Shaqiri is a doubt with a calf injury while Nathaniel Clyne remains a long-term absentee.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nLiverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Milner; Salah, Firmino, Mane.\n\nManchester United XI: Romero; Wan-Bissaka, Maguire, Lindelof, Shaw; McTominay, Matic, Pereira; James, Mata, Rashford.", "description": "Manchester United host Liverpool\u00a0at Old Trafford with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2018s side in desperate need of a result to reverse their dire form.\u00a0 United have taken just a point from their last three league games, including defeats to West Ham and Newcastle, and are without Paul Pogba and David De Gea.", "authors": ["Tom Kershaw"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/17/09/salah.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
