And your significant other might get tired of hearing you harp on work. That\u2019s why so many people in competitive, white-collar jobs hire coaches like Stafford. Or, they go to therapy.\n\nOf course, people have many reasons for seeking either coaching or therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy, in particular, has been shown to be as effective as medication for some forms of depression. Therapy of all kinds can address deeper traumas than your latest personal or professional snub. But a major perk of such services is that therapists are bound by law to not reveal anything about their clients to anyone, unless it\u2019s a matter of physical safety. Some therapists told me that they don\u2019t even keep written notes, in case they ever get subpoenaed. (Stafford said she doesn\u2019t reveal what her clients say in coaching even at the request of employers who pay for it.)\n\nThe confidentiality of therapy can thus make it the ultimate safe space: a place to unleash all your gossip and guarantee that no one will find out.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed this is especially a motivator in Washington, a uniquely competitive place where many jobs are top secret, or might as well be. As my colleague Kathy Gilsinan put it, \u201cNo one moves to Washington to find themselves.\u201d People move here, for the most part, to work. Many, at their dream job\u2014one countless other people are vying for. Ladder-climbing is our sport. Bars here overflow with people one-upping one another at pub trivia, and people lay out their five-year plan on first dates.\n\nThe stress and anxiety provide a lot to complain about. Yet there are few safe venues in which to do it. Many people here, after all, work for political parties locked in constant, direct opposition to one another. Keith Miller, a D.C. psychotherapist and mindfulness teacher, estimates that at least half of his clients have jobs that can\u2019t be discussed easily with friends or professional contacts. Take two pals who work for opposing political parties. \u201cThey\u2019re friends because they like each other, and they hang out together and they drink together,\u201d Miller says. \u201cBut they work for the enemy. And mistakes happen, because the desire to connect to another human is stronger than the desire to do things by the book.\u201d D.C.\u2019s an insular town: The guy you met on Tinder might soon be your new co-worker.\n\nBecause of that, many Washingtonians spout off in therapy. Several therapists told me that the stress of on-the-job competition is one of the biggest work-related issues they see\u2014followed closely by bad bosses. Miller often sees clients who have so much pent-up stress, they become angry or, conversely, grow withdrawn and burned-out. Some people take their frustrations to the bedroom. Another D.C. therapist, Karen Osterle, told me, \u201cThe amount of infidelity in this town is enough to change one\u2019s worldview.\u201d", "description": "A side benefit of therapy is that it\u2019s the perfect place for gossip.", "authors": ["Olga Khazan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS187WH/facebook.jpg?1568918808", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
