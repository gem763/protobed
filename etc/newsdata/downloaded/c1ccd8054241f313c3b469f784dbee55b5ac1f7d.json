(Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nLast month, as Washington dug into a July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump still made time for dinner.\n\nA state dinner, to be exact. His guests of honor? Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his wife, Jennifer.\n\nNow Morrison\u2019s government is one of several that find themselves embroiled in a growing political scandal out of Washington. The New York Times reported this week that in a recent phone call, Trump asked Morrison to help his administration investigate then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe into alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. The White House then limited access to the transcript of the call, the Times reported.\n\nThe Washington Post also reported that Attorney General William P. Barr has traveled abroad to meet with foreign intelligence officials as part of the Justice Department\u2019s inquiry into the Mueller probe and that requests for assistance were made to Australia.\n\n[Barr personally asked foreign officials to aid inquiry into CIA, FBI activities in 2016]\n\nIn response to the revelations, the Australian government said in a statement this week that it \u201chas always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation.\"\n\n\u201cThe P.M. confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the [American] President,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe episode highlights what has become a particularly cozy relationship between Trump and Morrison \u2014 with the state dinner in Washington only the latest gesture that signaled the White House is prioritizing a partnership with its ally Down Under.\n\nIn a toast to Morrison in the Rose Garden on Sept. 20, Trump heaped praise on the Australian leader, drawing comparisons between Australia\u2019s and the United States\u2019 national histories. He even quoted the late Australian poet Mary Gilmore \u2014 who just happens to have been Morrison\u2019s great-great-aunt.\n\nThen he raised his glass \u201cto very special people and a very, very special country.\u201d\n\nIt was only the second time Trump has hosted a state dinner since his inauguration in January 2017. The first was an April 2018 meal with French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte (although some specialists take issue with the September meal\u2019s classification as a state dinner, considering that as prime minister, Morrison is technically head of Australia\u2019s government, not its state).\n\nBut even if they have different titles, Morrison and Trump have latched onto the idea that they have a lot in common.\n\nLike Trump, Morrison defied polls in his country\u2019s last election. Like Trump, he made key allies in coal country on the campaign trail. And like Trump, he has made his hard-line views on immigration a focal point of his administration\u2019s policies.\n\nLast month, Morrison attended a Trump rally in Ohio, where he acknowledged it\u2019s not a foreign leader\u2019s job to get involved in domestic politics but said \u201cwe do share a lot of the same views.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe people should keep more of what they earn, we do think the best form of welfare is a job, we do think you can stimulate and ensure your small business entrepreneurs like we were seeing this morning,\u201d he said.\n\nAustralia has long been a close ally of the United States. And even as Trump has lashed out against a wide variety of U.S. allies, he has kept his interactions with Morrison warm \u2014 a notable change from his relationship with Morrison\u2019s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nIn 2017, a week into his presidency, Trump spoke by phone with Turnbull, who was then prime minister, for what was supposed to be a routine, introductory call. Instead, Trump blasted him over an existing agreement that the United States would accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center, and told him that of all the talks he had had with world leaders that day, \u201cthis was the worst call by far,\u201d The Post reported at the time. Then, 25 minutes into what was scheduled to be an hour-long conversation, Trump unexpectedly hung up.\n\nMorrison was elected the next year and defied expectations by holding on to power in a May vote, which Trump later called \u201ca tremendous victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t surprise me, but he surprised a lot of other people,\u201d Trump said when the two met during the June G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. \u201cThey called it an upset, but I don\u2019t call it an upset.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic thing you did,\u201d he told Morrison.\n\nMorrison quipped that Trump had a \u201cwarm invitation\u201d to visit Melbourne for a golf tournament. When asked by a reporter if he saw how his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy could be interpreted by some allies, including Australia, as \u201cAmerica alone,\u201d Trump replied that Washington takes \u201ccare of our allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think Australia is a good example,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked together very closely.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTom Cruise meets Ukrainian president in Kiev amid Trump impeachment crisis\n\nOn the menu for the Trumps\u2019 Australia state dinner: A refined taste of America\n\n\u2018People just lost hope\u2019: After Australia\u2019s election, asylum seekers attempted suicide", "description": "Trump has cozied up to Morrison for months, hosting him for a state dinner just last month.", "authors": ["Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady", "Staff Writer", "Foreign Desk", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vrDYCnYNEmcTWA22a74VmCYipGc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YQ6K4QHEJII6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
