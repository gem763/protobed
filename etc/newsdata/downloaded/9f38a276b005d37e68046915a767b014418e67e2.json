We really wanted children. we didn't want to wait until he got back. So we got married in the July before he left, and we were lucky.'\n\nDue to the severe weather conditions during the expedition it would have been impossible for Lindsay to fly back at any time because no flights were going in or out.\n\nBecky admitted that, although she had agreed to Lindsay leaving, she found it difficult to cope at times.\n\nShe said: 'I had Walter, he wasn't the easiest of babies.\n\nLindsay confessed that although it was a 'very special' moment meeting his son for the first time, he was 'nervous' to come home and adapt to life in the UK after his time away\n\n'It was okay to start with and then six weeks in I phoned him sobbing. I just have one of those babies who cries.'\n\nLindsay interjected, insisting that he too found it tough to be away from his family: 'Then I'd ring you in tears. The last thing I wanted to do was ring saying I wanted to get home.'\n\nThe couple were able to make use of technology during the trip, with the cameraman recording himself reading stories so his son could hear his voice.\n\nBecky said: 'Technology was great, we could FaceTime and message all the time, and by the time I got back I felt like I knew him so well\n\n'Lindsay recorded some stories and I played them everyday so he could hear his voice.'\n\nA group of emperor penguins and their babies on BBC One series Dynasties were at risk of dying in an icy ravine due to bitter -76F (-60C) conditions\n\nThe crew took a unanimous decision to dig an escape ramp in deadly cold temperatures to save them and Lindsay is pictured digging the path\n\nLindsay also reflected on the moment the crew, Will Lawson and Stefan Christmann took a unanimous decision to dig an escape ramp in deadly cold temperatures to save them.\n\nHe said: 'We couldn't walk away knowing we hadn't done anything.'\n\nPreviously speaking of the incident, director Lawson said: 'We opted to intervene passively. Once we'd dug that little ramp, which took very little time, we left it to the birds. We were elated when they decided to use it.\n\n'There's no rule book in those situations. You can only respond to the facts that are right there in front of you.\n\nOne by one, each penguin became aware of the possibilities the ramp offered and, by following the birds in front, they began to edge themselves to freedom\n\nLindsay has previously spoken of the 'joy and relief' he felt while watching them line up along the ramp\n\n'As you can imagine, we only show a fraction of the real trauma and difficulty that the animals go through \u2013 it was a very hard thing to see.'\n\nThere were no other animals for miles - so it was just the birds and the crew.\n\nLawson added: 'What was unique with this was that the only other animal there was us \u2013 nothing else would directly benefit from this. I'm sure some people will have an opinion in the other direction but in my heart of hearts I think we made the right decision.'", "description": "Lindsay Mccrae, 29, from Cumbria was David Attenborough's Dynasties cameraman and said he would sit on the ice and cry over the outstanding beauty of the penguins he was filming.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20275724-0-image-a-20_1572260779325.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
