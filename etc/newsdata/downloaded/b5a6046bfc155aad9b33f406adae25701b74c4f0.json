He said the details \"are somewhat controversial perhaps given the makeup of the courtroom.\"\n\nCourtroom No. 3 was packed with the friends and family of Kozak and Laplante. They came to learn Laplante's fate and hear details about what happened to Kozak on the night of Aug. 10, 2018.\n\n\"I think they thought they could just make a plea deal, push it under the rug and have it over without much attention being paid to the whole process,\" said Nadia Kozak, who was expecting a trial and travelled to Saskatoon last week from Victoria, B.C., after learning about Laplante's plea and sentencing hearing.\n\nLaplante's victim, Elijah Kozak, left, was survived by his mother Nadia, right. (Nadia Kozak)\n\nThe crowded gallery listened Thursday through frequent clanging and muffled voices coming through the thin walls of the courtroom, as well as interruptions from within the gallery itself.\n\nAccording to an agreed statement of facts, Kozak and Laplante got into a fight in a seventh-floor apartment hallway in downtown Saskatoon.\n\nLaplante was visiting his sister Shayna Laplante at the apartment building. Shayna was Kozak's girlfriend at the time.\n\nKozak came to the building shortly after 10 p.m. Shayna didn't let him into the apartment.\n\n\"[Kozak] could be violent and unpredictable,\" said Claxton-Viczko, reading from the agreed statement of facts partly drawn from Shayna's police statement.\n\n\"Elijah heard Duran's voice and thought Shayna was cheating on him so he continued to kick and pound on the door,\" Claxton-Viczko said.\n\nThis 5th Avenue apartment building is where Kozak was stabbed by Laplante. (Guy Quenneville/CBC)\n\nAround 20 minutes passed until an angry Duran Laplante opened the apartment door and confronted Kozak in the hallway. Shayna stayed inside the apartment but watched part of the ensuing tussle through the partly-open door.\n\n\"[Duran Laplante now] advises that Elijah produced a knife, that he was able to disarm him and after doing so stabbed him once with the intention of making him leave,\" Claxton-Viczko said.\n\nLaplante fled the building. Police and paramedics found Kozak on the hallway floor with one stab wound in his stomach. He was pronounced dead in hospital less than an hour later.\n\nLaplante turned himself in to police 11 days later. He was interviewed \"but maintained his right to silence at that time,\" Claxton-Viczko said.\n\nToday, \"he acknowledges that the stab wound resulted in Elijah's death,\" she added.\n\nThe back of the business card handed out by Laplante's legal aid lawyer. Laplante initially said nothing when arrested by police. Exactly when he agreed to take a plea is unclear. (Guy Quenneville/CBC)\n\n'A lot of that isn't true'\n\nJudge Anand then asked Masiowski if Laplante agreed to those facts.\n\nYes, Masiowski said, before turning to his client in the prisoner's box. \"Is that correct, Duran? Are we admitting those facts, Duran?\n\nAt least fifteen seconds passed before Duran said he had problems with his sister Shayna's statement.\n\nLAPLANTE: A lot of that isn't true so it's kind of like yes and no.\n\nMASIOWSKI: Maybe we'd better adjourn for a few minutes so I can speak to him about what he's referring to that isn't true. I do have written instructions. So it is a bit of a surprise.\n\nJUDGE ANAND: That's probably a good idea.\n\nWhen court resumed, Masiowski explained that while Laplante did not believe his sister was a reliable witness, he did not dispute his role in Kozak's death.\n\nAnand accepted Laplante's plea, and the matter appeared settled \u2014 until it was time for Laplante to make his statement.\n\n'I'm not a monster'\n\nLaplante appeared in court wearing a black hoodie from Crooks and Castles.\n\nHe rose up in his box, unfolded a piece of paper and began by telling Kozak's family that he was \"sorry for everything.\"\n\n\"I just wanted you to know that I'm not a killer. I'm not a monster. I'm not a bad person. Before all this, I was just a kid who stayed home and played video games,\" he said.\n\nLaplante said he was only trying to defend himself against Kozak.\n\n\"Even though I took [things] a little bit past defence, I feel it was all a big mistake. I just wanted to say sorry, that I never tried to kill anyone in my life.\"\n\nThen came a tense exchange between Laplante and Anand, who explained the legal meaning of Laplante's already-entered plea.\n\nJUDGE ANAND: You've entered a guilty plea to manslaughter, which is one of the three forms of homicide in the criminal code. By virtue of doing that, you have admitted to the community that you are a killer. You need to take \u2014 you need to understand what that means. You've taken someone's life. So when you tell me, 'I'm not a killer,' you're wrong. You are a killer. You're not a murderer, because you didn't intend to kill someone\u2014\n\nLAPLANTE: I never tried to kill anyone.\n\nJUDGE ANAND: But you still took his life.\n\nLaplante continued to demur, sparking a final exchange.\n\nJUDGE ANAND: I think that, uh\u2026 I think you've got some work to do, sir, in terms of coming to grips with your reality. Because, like I said, you've plead guilty to manslaughter.\n\nAfter that, Laplante appeared to capitulate.\n\nLAPLANTE: Well, uh, I am here to plead guilty and just take responsibility, I guess. So I guess I am a killer, if that's what you're saying.\n\nJUDGE ANAND: That's not only what I'm saying, that's what you've said.\n\nTaking into account the time he's already served in remand, Laplante has three years and three months left to serve behind bars.\n\nLaplante won't be allowed to own or possess a gun for 10 years after his release.\n\n'Everything felt very rushed'\n\nNadia Kozak, Elijah Kozak's mother, said she felt Laplante's case played out in a \"disgusting and atrocious way\" \u2014 and not just because she was interrupted during her victim impact statement by both Laplante and his supporters in the gallery.\n\nKozak said she had been gearing up for a second-degree murder trial only to learn on the weekend before Thanksgiving \u2014 via a voicemail from the Crown prosecutor's office \u2014 that Laplante would be entering a guilty plea to manslaughter.\n\n\"It just makes it feel like my son's life didn't matter, that it wasn't worth taking the time to go to a trial to try to find out what really happened,\" she said.\n\nKozak said Claxton-Viczko only advised her family on Thanksgiving Monday about how to file a victim impact statement.\n\n\"Everything felt very rushed,\" Kozak said.\n\n\"My son's time was cut short by a willful act that someone else is responsible for. And then we're thrown into a system where we don't even have the time or aren't given the heads up we need to try to tell\u2026 a bit about [Elijah].\"\n\nKozak's family described him as a curious and generous man who, despite his own poverty and homelessness, gave out five dollar bills to fellow street people. (Nadia Kozak)\n\nElijah was homeless at the time of his death and struggled with mental health and addictions issues, Nadia Kozak said.\n\nBut she and other family members also described him as a generous man who, despite his own misfortune, gave out five dollar bills to fellow street people. After his death, his family went downtown and did the same in his honour.\n\nTheir grief came out in other ways, they said.\n\n\"We put on costumes and went out bowling because frankly we didn't know what to do with ourselves,\" said Elijah's aunt Sarah Kozak.\n\n'He made the choice to do that'\n\nNadia Kozak spoke of how even making dinner triggered thoughts of her son's death.\n\n\"I look at the knife in my hand and I think of how something like this was used to kill my son,\" she said. \"My housemates removed a knife block from the kitchen counter and stored it out of sight in a drawer.\"\n\nKozak said a trial would have tested Laplante's credibility and further fleshed out Laplante's behaviour on the night of Elijah's death \u2014 including his decision to open the apartment door and confront Elijah in the hallway\n\n\"He made the choice to do that,\" she said.\n\nOn the other hand, Masiowski said there were \"triable issues that [Lapante] gave up\" by not going to trial, including elements of self-defence\n\n\"There was also, just in the general scheme of things, what I would suggest \u2014 if we look at the whole constellation of what happened here \u2014 somewhat mitigating [factors] in terms of what my client's role was.\"\n\nCBC News has reached out to both Claxton-Viczko and Masiowski for further comment.\n\n'Use that to do some good'\n\nManslaughter carries no minimum sentence, but second-degree murder \u2014 which Laplante was originally charged with \u2014 comes with a minimum sentence of life in prison with no parole for 10 years.\n\nAnand ended his comments to Laplante by telling him his killing of Kozak doesn't have to be the only thing that defines him after his release.\n\n\"In 39 months, your sentence will be over,\" Anand said. \"You'll have the rest of your life to redefine yourself. And my hope is that you'll keep in mind what you did to the Kozak family and what you did to him\u2026. and you'll use that to do some good in the world.\"", "description": "\"I think you've got some work to do in terms of coming to grips with your reality,\" Saskatoon Judge Sanjeev Anand tells convicted killer Duran Laplante.", "authors": ["Reporter", "Web Writer For Cbc Saskatoon", "Story Tips", "Ideas", "Complaints", "Just Want To Say 'Hi'", "Write Me At Guy.Quenneville Cbc.Ca", "Follow Guy On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4788713.1571356432!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/laplante.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
