Rick Scott. | Win McNamee/Getty Images Energy & Environment Rick Scott: Florida \u2018not off the hook\u2019 when it comes to Hurricane Dorian\n\nWith Hurricane Dorian\u2019s trajectory still uncertain and Florida potentially avoiding a direct hit, Florida Sen. Rick Scott wants residents to know that they\u2019re not out of the woods just yet.\n\n\u201cWhat worries me is that everybody is going to look at that little track right in the middle instead of this cone of uncertainty,\u201d the Republican senator and former Florida governor said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201c\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s my biggest concern \u2014 that people are going to think we\u2019re off the hook. We are not off the hook,\u201d Scott added. \u201cPlus, we\u2019re still going to get storm surge. We\u2019re going to get lots of rain the closer it gets to Florida. We\u2019re getting to get more rain which can cause flooding. So take it seriously. Overprepare, don\u2019t underprepare.\u201d\n\nScott also noted that there are extra difficulties when trying to evacuate people for a storm that has as many questions as Dorian.\n\n\u201cThis is like [Hurricane] Matthew a couple years ago. We had to start evacuating, even though it stayed off the coast,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to overprepare because if it turns, it\u2019s too late. You can\u2019t get that. So that\u2019s why I tell everybody to have your water \u2014 seven days' [worth] \u2014 your food, your medicine. But also, if you think there\u2019s any chance you\u2019re going to have to evacuate, do it now and get ahead of the game.\u201d\n\nFlorida Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on what's hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State.

As governor, you need to listen. You need to stay ahead of it. As issues come up, every storm is a little bit different and the issues are different. Just react.\u201d\n\nScott told Fox host Chris Wallace that the concern and worry you feel amid these storms don\u2019t change \u2014 whether you\u2019re a governor or senator.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change, Chris. Your heart goes out to everybody and you\u2019re worried about them,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I always tell everybody, you can rebuild your house but you can\u2019t rebuild your family. I love my family ,and so, you know, I\u2019m concerned about people and I\u2019m concerned \u2014 are they taking this seriously enough? And that doesn\u2019t change whether you\u2019re the governor or the senator, and my job, my role now is to make sure the federal government does their response.\u201d", "description": "The Florida senator urges residents of his state to \u201coverprepare.\u201d", "authors": ["Aubree Eliza Weaver"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ae/c5/60359eef4a4ca76c5947b1dac9c1/20190901-rick-scott-senate-gty-773.jpg"}
