Obviously, work is necessary to earn an income, and if you get good job satisfaction it\u2019s a bonus! But what can make it more worthwhile are the extra perks that your employer offers you as a reward for your loyalty and commitment.\n\nEmployee benefits are commonplace these days. Traditionally, these have included a good pension and extra days off work. But when a job used to be for life, there wasn\u2019t much incentive to try and keep staff. Now millennials look to leave their jobs within the first two years, and when they are seeking a position, they want to know the benefits they\u2019ll get on top of their pay. These include half-price cinema tickets, cycle to work schemes and gym passes.\n\nBut these perks come at a cost to an employer, and now technology is being used to discover if and when they offer value for money. Writing for the BBC, Jessica Bown says \u201cEmerging technologies such as data analytics, chatbots, and wearables can help employers know which benefits resonate with employees.\u201d The idea is to avoid wasting money on things that don\u2019t get used and enable a company to tailor what it can offer to attract and retain the right staff.\n\nAs an example, at merchant bank, Close Brothers, AI has been used to develop chatbots that can help employees to find information on subjects ranging from mental health to saving for retirement at any time. And Microsoft has developed software to help businesses track their employee\u2019s wellbeing needs. Anna Rasmussen, founder of Open Blend, told the BBC \u201cIt shows companies what their employees need to stay motivated and reach their full potential in real-time.\u201d Insurance company Vitality offer wearable technology to track employees\u2019 movements. Staff can earn \u2018rewards\u2019 by having their activity tracked. A study found that by measuring participant\u2019s performance, they did the equivalent of 4.8 extra days of activity per month.\n\nIt seems that if used in the right way, technology can provide greater engagement between an employee and the company. That can lead to a happier, healthier and committed work force. But human resources experts warn against relying solely on tech for deciding on employee benefits provision. Greater understanding of new technology and how it\u2019s used is needed, they say.\n\n\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\n\nslog \u8d39\u529b\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u82e6\u6d3b\n\ntask \u4efb\u52a1\n\nincome \u6536\u5165\n\njob satisfaction \u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\n\nbonus \u989d\u5916\u7684\u597d\u5904\n\nperk \uff08\u5de5\u4f5c\uff09\u6d25\u8d34\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u798f\u5229\n\nloyalty \u5fe0\u5b9e\uff0c\u5fe0\u8bda\n\ncommitment \u6295\u5165\uff0c\u5949\u732e\n\nemployee benefit \u5458\u5de5\u798f\u5229\n\npension \u517b\u8001\u91d1\n\nfor life \u4e00\u751f\u7684\uff0c\u7ec8\u751f\u7684\n\nincentive \u6fc0\u52b1\n\nposition \u804c\u4f4d\n\ncycle to work scheme \u82f1\u653f\u5e9c\u901a\u8fc7\u62b5\u7a0e\u4f18\u60e0\u9f13\u52b1\u4f01\u4e1a\u5458\u5de5\u5065\u5eb7\u73af\u4fdd\u51fa\u884c\u7684 \u201c\u9a91\u8f66\u4e0a\u73ed\u201d \u798f\u5229\u8ba1\u5212\n\nvalue for money \u7269\u6709\u6240\u503c\n\nresonate with \u4e0e\u2026\u2026\u5f15\u8d77\u5171\u9e23\n\ntailor \u4e13\u95e8\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u2026\u2026\u7684\u9700\u8981\n\nretain \u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u4fdd\u4f4f\n\nretirement \u9000\u4f11\n\nwellbeing \u5e78\u798f\n\nmotivated \u6709\u79ef\u6781\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u5145\u6ee1\u52a8\u529b\u7684\n\nfull potential \u6700\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\n\nengagement \u4e92\u52a8\n\nhuman resources \u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\n\n\u6d4b\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7ec3\u4e60\n\n1. \u9605\u8bfb\u8bfe\u6587\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n1.
