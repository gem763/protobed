Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) threatened sanctions against Turkey if it invades Syria. | Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images\n\nTHE PRESIDENT\u2019S decision to change course in Syria has united Republicans against him, and it threatens a new round of Congress-versus-the-administration griping with consequences on the global stage.\n\n-- SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.) on Twitter: \u201cJust spoke to Sen @ChrisVanHollen about situation in Syria. We will introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria and will call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the U.S. in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate.\n\n\u201cHope and expect sanctions against Turkey \u2013 if necessary \u2013 would be veto-proof. This decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran, & Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids. Shot in the arm to the bad guys. Devastating for the good guys.\u201d\n\n-- @NikkiHaley: \u201cWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend\u201d\n\n-- SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-Maine): \u201cThis is a terribly unwise decision by the President to abandon our Kurdish allies, who have been our major partner in the fight against the Islamic State.\u201d\n\n-- SEN. BEN SASSE (R-Neb.): \u201cIf the President sticks with this retreat, he needs to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children. I hope the President will listen to his generals and reconsider. And before Turkey butchers innocent Kurds, Erdogan should carefully consider his privileged status as a NATO member. The American people don\u2019t partner with genocidal regimes.\u201d\n\n-- EVEN FOX AND FRIENDS\u2019 BRIAN KILMEADE trashed the president\u2019s plan. The video\n\n-- \u201c\u2018Disaster in the making\u2019: Republicans torch Trump\u2019s Syria policy,\u201d by Quint Forgey and David Cohen\n\n\u2026 OK, NOT EVERYBODY! -- @RandPaul: \u201cI stand with @realDonaldTrump today as he once again fulfills his promises to stop our endless wars and have a true America First foreign policy.\u201d\n\nTRUMP TO KURDS: FIGURE IT OUT -- @realDonaldTrump at 7:40 a.m.: \u201cThe United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight. When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate,.....\u201d\n\n\u201c....including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA! I said \u2018NO, we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in U.S. prisons at tremendous cost. They are yours for trials.\u2019 They.....\u201d \u201c.....again said \u2018NO,\u2019 thinking, as usual, that the U.S. is always the \u2018sucker,\u2019 on NATO, on Trade, on everything. The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades. I held off this fight for....\u201d\n\n\u201c....almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to.....\u201d \u201c...figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u2018neighborhood.\u2019 They all hate ISIS, have been enemies for years. We are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!\u201d\n\n\u2026 at 11:20 a.m.: \u201cI was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\u2019t even like the USA. The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China, because they love seeing us bogged.....\u201d \u201c....down, watching over a quagmire, & spending big dollars to do so. When I took over, our Military was totally depleted. Now it is stronger than ever before. The endless and ridiculous wars are ENDING! We will be focused on the big picture, knowing we can always go back & BLAST!\u201d\n\n\u2026 at 11:38 a.m.: \u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over\u2026\u201d \u201c....the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!\u201d\n\nTHE PENTAGON: \u201cThe Department of Defense made clear to Turkey - as did the President - that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria. The U.S. Armed Forces will not support, or be involved in any such operation.\u201d The full statement\n\nIN OUR GREAT AND UNMATCHED WISDOM, good Monday afternoon. The president will sign trade and digital trade agreements with Japan at 3:30 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room, the White House announced. It will be open to the press pool.\n\nA message from The Coalition Against Socialized Medicine: Nancy Pelosi\u2019s drug pricing proposal would put foreign bureaucrats in control of Americans\u2019 medicine cabinet, lead to access restrictions for America\u2019s patients, and stifle innovation, threatening the cutting-edge treatments and cures of tomorrow.

Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers quickly appealed the decision, and the appeals court agreed to temporarily block the order.\u201d NYT\n\nIMPEACHMENT LATEST -- HOUSE OVERSIGHT, House Intel and House Foreign Affairs subpoenaed OMB and the Pentagon in the impeachment probe. Letter to OMB, and document schedule \u2026 Letter to the Pentagon, and document schedule\n\n-- BLOOMBERG: \u201cGeorge Kent, the State Department official in Washington who oversees Ukraine policy, won\u2019t testify before Congress\u2019s impeachment investigators Monday, as was initially requested. The three House committees leading the probe are still discussing when his deposition can be rescheduled.\u201d\n\n-- AT LEAST HE\u2019S HONEST! \u2026 Pool report, from Newsday\u2019s Laura Figueroa: \u201cAsked if POTUS was joking in any way or not serious when he suggested China should investigate the Bidens, [Larry] Kudlow said: \u2018I don't honestly know.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- FLASHBACK: In May, Fox News asked Trump whether China should investigate Biden. His response: \u201c100 percent. It\u2019s a disgrace.\"\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

In a statement released Monday announcing his departure, Volker specifically referenced the growing Ukraine scandal and the ensuing media frenzy.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTHE STEP BACK \u2026 WAPO\u2019S SEUNG MIN KIM and RACHAEL BADE: \u201cTrump\u2019s defiance of oversight presents new challenge to Congress\u2019s ability to rein in the executive branch\u201d: \u201c[T]he administration has run roughshod over Congress, prompting concerns among constitutional experts and lawmakers that Trump\u2019s hostile stance toward congressional oversight is undermining the separation of powers in a way that could have long-term implications for democracy.\n\n\u201c\u2018He is shaking the foundations of the republic,\u2019 said Kerry W.

Forty-eight hours later, China\u2019s state broadcaster said it would not show games of what had been one of China\u2019s most beloved sports teams. Corporate sponsors peeled away. \u2026\n\n\u201cPractically overnight, the Rockets were grounded by an increasingly powerful force in global business: Chinese nationalism. \u2026 But in Washington, lawmakers from both parties, including Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) immediately backed Morey\u2019s right to free speech and criticized what they called \u2018unacceptable\u2019 Chinese efforts to silence him.\u201d WaPo\n\n2020 WATCH -- MARC CAPUTO in Miami: \u201cTrump\u2019s enemies add up in the wrong state\u201d: \u201cSince taking office as president, Donald Trump has alienated what looks like a mini-United Nations of voters with deep connections to other countries, tens of thousands of whom live in the state that\u2019s essential to his re-election \u2014 Florida. Taken individually, these groups are just a marginal problem for a statewide candidate. But Florida is a state historically won at the margins \u2014 Trump won the state by just 1.2 percentage points in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe political turf is shifting in Florida as more and more non-white voters are added to the rolls both as a result of domestic and international migration, and natural growth. Since the last midterm election, 42 percent of the new voters who have registered are nonwhite. For the same period in the last presidential cycle, the percentage was 38.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NYT\u2019S TRIP GABRIEL in Erie, Pa.: \u201c\u2018I Gave the Other Guy a Shot\u2019: After taking a chance on Donald Trump in 2016, a swing county in western Pennsylvania is up for grabs again\u201d: \u201cHeading into 2020, there is intense focus among campaign strategists on the weakest element of the Trump coalition: the millions of voters who disapproved of both major candidates in 2016 but took a chance on Mr. Trump. \u2026\n\n\u201cIn interviews in Erie last month, before the impeachment inquiry began, many of the Trump voters from 2016 were either supportive of the president or unpersuaded by the Democratic alternatives. But reached by phone after the inquiry was announced, some of these voters had changed their minds. Outright conversions \u2026 while still rare, were reflected in an uptick of support for impeachment by independent voters in recent national polls.\u201d With several telling voter profiles: NYT\n\nTHE POLICY PRIMARY -- \u201cSanders unveils plan to stop corporate donations to Dem convention,\u201d by Holly Otterbein: \u201cThe Vermont senator pledges to put a stop to all corporate PAC contributions to the convention if he wins the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination. \u2026\n\n\u201cSanders\u2019 plan states that corporate lobbyists \u2018were everywhere and filled the VIP suites\u2019 at the [2016] convention, adding that \u2018this type of corporate sponsorship is a corrupting influence and must end if politicians are going to represent the American people.\u2019 His proposal also calls for a lifetime lobbying ban on Democratic National Committee chairs and co-chairs, as well as a prohibition on them working for companies that hold federal contracts or are trying to obtain government approval for mergers or other projects.\u201d POLITICO \u2026 The plan\n\n-- \u201cHow Pete Buttigieg would lower drug prices,\u201d by Sarah Karlin-Smith: \u201cThe wide-sweeping proposal, similar to plans from rival candidates and a bill from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calls on the government to negotiate the costs of drugs in Medicare, as well as the government-run \u2018public option\u2019 Buttigieg has proposed to compete with private insurers. Those prices would also be available to private health insurance plans and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cButtigieg would also cap out-of-pocket spending for seniors and people enrolled in the public option. Buttigieg aims to boost government investment in drug research and manufacturing, particularly for critical areas like pandemic prevention and antibiotics. His plan would also require more transparency on pricing from the drug industry and companies that administer pharmacy benefits.\u201d POLITICO \u2026 The plan\n\nTROUBLE WITH BOJO? -- \u201cBoris Johnson will speak to Trump if U.S. refuses to waive immunity for diplomat\u2019s wife,\u201d by Annabelle Dickson in London: \u201cBoris Johnson has urged the U.S. to reconsider giving immunity to the wife of a diplomat who is a suspect in a fatal road crash in the U.K. \u2014 and will raise the issue with Donald Trump if that doesn\u2019t happen.
