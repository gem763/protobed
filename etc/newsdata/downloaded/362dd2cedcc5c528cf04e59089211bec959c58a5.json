Toyota C-HR petrol (2016-)\n\nThe quirky looking Toyota CH-R, using a conventional petrol engine, will retain 48.1% of its value after the first 3 years of ownership from new\n\nAverage new price: \u00a325,464\n\nAverage value retained after 3 years: 48.1%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years: -\u00a313,218\n\nToyota's quirky looking C-HR SUV squeezes into the top 20 with petrol versions retaining just less than 50 per cent of their value after three years.\n\nThe compact size, unique styling and strong reliability record is making it desirable.\n\n19. Seat Ateca (2016-)\n\nThe Ateca is Seat's answer to a compact family SUV and is a cheaper alternative to a like-for-like Volkswagen model\n\nAverage new price: \u00a324,354\n\nAverage value retained after 3 years/60,000 miles: 48.1%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a312,661\n\nLike the C-HR, the Ateca is another compact SUV.\n\nDepreciation is slow due to the desirability of this type of car and also the fact it's a VW Group model, which tend to always hold value relatively strongly.\n\n18. Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe diesel (2016-)\n\nThe GLC Coupe's looks might not be for all but there's no denying the slow depreciation of Mercedes' classy large SUV\n\nAverage new price: \u00a346,059\n\nAverage value retained after 3 years/60,000 miles: 48.3%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a323,815\n\nIt's hard to believe that a car hemorrhaging almost \u00a324,000 of its original value in 36 months is among the slowest depreciating motors, but that's the case with the big - and in our opinion pretty hideous - GLC Coupe diesel.\n\n17. Lexus RX hybrid (2015-)\n\nLexus has for a long time been pioneering hybrid technology. The pay off is strong residual values today\n\nAverage new price: \u00a354,588\n\nAverage value retained after 3 years/60,000 miles: 48.4%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a328,163\n\nAnother large SUV to make it into this list is the hybrid-powered Lexus RX450h.\n\nToyota's premium brand tends to retain value well, and the addition of hybrid power - offering a safety net against emission-related taxes - only helps to improve residuals.\n\n16. Tesla Model X (2016- )\n\nThe Tesla Model X will retain almost half of its value after the first 3 years, but owners will still lose out on over \u00a350,000\n\nAverage new price: \u00a3100,667\n\nAverage value retained after 3 years/60,000 miles: 48.5%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a353,167\n\nIt's no surprise that electric cars hold their value well, especially as demand is on the up.\n\nThat said, Tesla Model X buyers - despite having the 16th slowest depreciating car - should expect to see their motors lose \u00a353,000 of their value in three years.\n\n15. Subaru Impreza (2014-)\n\nThe Subaru Impreza is now a sensible family hatchback with a strong track record of reliability\n\nAverage new price: \u00a330,240\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 49.1%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a315,390\n\nThe Subaru Impreza isn't the car it previously was. In the early '90s this was the choice model for rally fans and boy racers, but the current model is now a far more grown up family hatch.\n\nIt's super reliable as well as slow depreciating.\n\n14. Jaguar F-Pace diesel (2015-)\n\nF-Pace values were strong when it originally went on sale in 2015 but diesel models have continued to depreciate slowly\n\nAverage new price: \u00a345,020\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 49.2%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a322,920\n\nProving how demand big SUVs are today, the F-Pace almost retains half of its original value after three years of ownership.\n\nAnd this is for the diesel variants at a time when oil burners and widely being disregarded.\n\n13. Volkswagen Tiguan (2016-)\n\nThe Volkswagen Tiguan holds almost half of its value after 3 years and 60,000 miles says cap hpi\n\nAverage new price: \u00a333,260\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 49.8%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a316,710\n\nVolkswagen's smart looking Tiguan is holding its value well, both petrol and diesel variants.\n\nBuyers will get almost half their money back after three years and an average of 20,000 miles annually.\n\n12. Bentley Bentayga (2015-)\n\nThe Bentayga isn't what you call mainstream as such, but the volume of demand for Bentley's big SUV means it has a rightful place in this list\n\nAverage new price: \u00a3162,700\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 50%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a381,400\n\nOkay, the Bentayga's credentials as a 'mainstream' car, given its whopping price, is a bit of a stretch, but Bentley has been shifting them in big numbers for the last few years.\n\nThey retain half their value on average after 3 years - still losing over \u00a380,000.\n\n11. Lexus IS hybrid (2018-)\n\nAnother Lexus hybrid to rank in the top 20 list of slow depreciating cars is the IS300h - a premium-feeling family saloon\n\nAverage new price: \u00a336,810\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 51.2%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a317,960\n\nAnother hybrid Lexus to feature with the IS300h just missing out on the top 10.\n\nThe premium family saloon was only launched last year and is proving to have strong residuals at the moment, retaining more than half its value after 36 months.\n\nWhy car buyers (and financers) need to consider depreciation Depreciation of a vehicle is important to consider for private car buyers, both those who purchase outright and the majority who acquire a car using finance. For the former, a value-holding vehicle will get you more of your money back when it's time to sell. And for the latter, it's just as imperative as monthly payments will be lower if you choose a car that depreciates slowly. With Personal Contract Purchase - which is the most popular form of finance used for cars - the monthly installments paid are based on the vehicles loss of value over the duration of the contract. Therefore, a slower depreciating car means lower monthly installments. While this means the balloon payment required to buy the car outright at the end of the agreement will be higher, many choose to hand their motors back and take out a new finance contract on a new model.\n\n10. Maserati Levante diesel (2016-)\n\nThe Levante is Maserati's first attempt at big SUV - diesel models retain more than 50% of their value after the first 3 years\n\nAverage new price: \u00a356,500\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 51.3%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a327,500\n\nThe Levante is arguably one of the best looking big SUVs on the market to date, which is no small feat considering it's Maserati's first attempt.\n\nDiesel values are - in a difficult climate - remaining strong.\n\n9. Kia Niro (2016-)\n\nKia Niro SUV has placed in the top 10. It proves the incredible rise of the Korean brand in the last few years\n\nAverage new price: \u00a324,320\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 51.4%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a311,820\n\nContinuing the trend of SUVs, the Kia Niro has made it into the top 10 with an average value retention after three years of more than 51 per cent.\n\nNot bad for an affordable family motor from a Korean brand that was previously often overlooked.\n\n8. Mercedes-AMG GLC Coupe (2016-)\n\nAMG variants of the GLC Coupe are holding more value than the standard version, which featured earlier in this countdown\n\nAverage new price: \u00a352,470\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 51.5%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a325,453\n\nThe GLC Coupe diesel has already featured in this list at number 18, but buyers with deeper pockets who can stretch to AMG performance models can expect slightly better value retention levels of 51.5 per cent after three years and 60,000 miles.\n\n7. Mercedes-Benz V-Class (2014-)\n\nYet another Mercedes, though this one is somewhat different. The V-Class is the vehicle of choice if you have a whopping family\n\nAverage new price: \u00a351,535\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 51.9%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a324,814\n\nIf you have a large family and need something bigger than an SUV or traditional MPV, the small people carrier route might be your only choice.\n\nThe V-Class is one of the most premium models in this limited sector, which explains the slow depreciation.\n\n6. Toyota CH-R hybrid (2016-)\n\nToyota's CH-R SUV with the conventional petrol engine placed earlier in this list but the hybrid variants are even slower to depreciate, cap hpi records show\n\nAverage new price: \u00a326,931\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 53.1%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a312,615\n\nToyota has for the last few years shifted away from diesel powertrains in favour of hybirds - a move that in hindsight has been positive and helped its models retain value well.\n\nThe hybrid CH-R just misses out on the top 5 slow depreciating models.\n\n5. Volkswagen Caravelle diesel (2010-)\n\nLike the Mercedes V-Class featured earlier, the VW Caravelle is very much aimed at those with big families - or entire football teams - to transport\n\nAverage new price: \u00a343,789\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 53.4%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a320,409\n\nLike the Mercedes V-Class, the Caravelle is Volkswagen's answer to large family transportation.\n\nBuy one new and three years later it will still have retained over 53 per cent of its original value, even after 60 miles of driving.\n\n4. Mercedes-AMG GLC (2016-)\n\nLuxurious, large and likely to hold its value: The Mercedes-AMG GLC is super quick but slow to depreciate\n\nAverage new price: \u00a350,113\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 53.4%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a323,363\n\nBig dimension, big power and big value retention potential.\n\nThat's according to cap hpi, which says the Mercedes-AMG GLC SUV, on average, holds more than half its value after three years and 60,000 miles of ownership.\n\n3. Peugeot 3008 (2016-)\n\nIt's not all premium brands here: Peugeot's 3008 proves an affordable family car can hold its value well too\n\nAverage new price: \u00a324,483\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 54.2%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a311,217\n\nIf you thought the top five slow depreciating cars would be dominated by premium brands, you'd be wrong.\n\nPeugeot's popular 3008 - voted the 2017 European Car of the Year - is holding its value very well as demand remains high for the family SUV.\n\n2. Mercedes-AMG CLA (2016-)\n\nMercedes' high-performance small saloon holds 54.3% of its value after 3 years\n\nAverage new price: \u00a345,653\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 54.3%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a320,887\n\nThe latest generation Mercedes A-Class has become a seriously popular car in the UK, and the CLA saloon version with AMG power under the bonnet holds an impressive amount of its original value after three years.\n\n1. Volkswagen California (2010-)\n\nThe VW California is an MPV and camper van rolled into one. With examples holding almost 61% of their new value after 3 years, it's by far and away the slowest depreciating mainstream model you can buy today\n\nAverage new price: \u00a355,174\n\nAverage value retention after 3 years/60,000 miles: 60.9%\n\nAverage loss in value after 3 years/60,000 miles: -\u00a321,564\n\nThe California is Volkswagen's modern day answer to the iconic Camper - a sort of compact mobile home with premium touches.\n\nIncredibly, value retention is far and above any other mainstream model, though this might be due to the comparatively small production output and niche market.\n\nYou can read our full review of the California here.", "description": "In the current market, where around 8 in 10 new cars are financed and monthly payments are impacted by the rate of depreciation, its becoming more important to find a model that holds its value.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
