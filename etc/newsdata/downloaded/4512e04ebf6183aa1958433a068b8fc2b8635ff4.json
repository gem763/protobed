Not necessarily at the same time, but either individually and [sometimes] together. And that was so important because that helped them understand me and how my mind was working. And I think the way the therapy helped me was that I didn't need my family to say, 'What can we do?' The only thing they could do was just come to some of the therapy sessions to start to understand.\"\n\n\"Despite all of it, I'm very pleased that I went through it, because of who I am on the other side,\" James said. \"It's like a rebirth. I can't remember feeling like it [ever]. This is who I am now. I am conscious that I have not got rid of it, it's still there. But I'm on top of it, and I'm aware that if I don't work hard at maintaining control of it, then it has the ability to come back.\"\n\nJames didn't come alone to his interview. He brought Ella \u2013 his cocker spaniel \u2013 with him.\n\nAccording to E! News, James works as an ambassador for the Pets as Therapy \u2013 an organisation that helps people with mental health cope by surrounding themselves with animals. Ella is James's emotional support dog.\n\n\"I have such confidence when I am with her,\" he said. \"If I was to have come on this shoot today without her, I probably wouldn't have said that much. If you want me in the room, the dogs need to be in the room.\"\n\nFunny enough, it was Ella who introduced James to Alizee Thevenet \u2013 his fianc\u00e9 and the reason he \"couldn't be happier\" now.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the couple first met at the South Kensington Club when Ella wondered off and right into the arms of Alizee.\n\nAnd the rest, as they say, is history.", "description": "James Middleton recently opened up about the importance of having the support of your family and friends when it comes to dealing with mental health.", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5456/6ae4cf3ea9a14bd5b951d49c2558624f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
