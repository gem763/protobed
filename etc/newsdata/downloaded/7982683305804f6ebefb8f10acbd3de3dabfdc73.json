The athletic department has partnered with Ball, a company that creates sustainable beverage packaging, to distribute all their beverages at home football games in an aluminum cup. The cup can be recycled and made into a new can or cup within 60 days.\n\n\u201cAluminum cups and cans are lightweight and can be easily stacked, which provides storage and shipping efficiencies,\u201d said Renee Robinson, director of corporate communications for Ball. \u201cThe light weight also limits overall transportation carbon emissions through logistics and supply chains.\u201d\n\nThe sustainable cups, which are lightweight and made of aluminum, will debut at Buffaloes football games at Folsom Field this weekend -- and won't increase the price of beer, according to the university.

The cups will be collected in recycling bins then sorted from plastic and paper products. From there, all the aluminum cups are processed and made into aluminum ingots, which are the shape of gold bars, and then rolled into sheets.\n\nBall has similar pilot projects in the works for other sports venues as well.", "description": "The University of Colorado-Boulder will begin using aluminum cups which can be recycled as part of the university Athletic Department's zero waste goal.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Ball_CU-Cup.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
