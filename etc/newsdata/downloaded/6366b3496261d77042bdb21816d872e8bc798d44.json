(AP) - New York state will require health warning signs in shops that sell vaping devices following hundreds of cases of lung illnesses believed to be related to the habit, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday.\n\nThe state will also issue subpoenas to three companies that sell a vaping liquid additive that state health officials believe could be making people sick.\n\nCuomo urged people not to vape while investigations into the cause of the illnesses are ongoing.\n\n\u201cThis is a frightening public health phenomenon,\u201d the Democrat told reporters at a Manhattan press conference Monday. \u201cCommon sense says if you don\u2019t know what you are smoking, don\u2019t smoke it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur advice, our guidance is quite simple: Don\u2019t do it,\u201d Cuomo said of vaping. \u201cDon\u2019t do it because we do not know that it is safe.\u201d\n\nU.S. health officials have identified about 450 possible illness cases in 33 states, including as many as five deaths. No single device or ingredient has been tied to all the illnesses. Many of those who were sickened said they\u2019d been vaping THC.\n\nThe warning signs will be required to go in any store that sells vaping products. They read: \u201cVaping can expose you to toxic chemicals and kill you.\u201d\n\nThe three companies to be subpoenaed each sell a substance containing Vitamin E acetate used to thicken vaping liquid. While Vitamin E is known to be used as a supplement or skin care product without ill effects, state health officials say it could cause problems if inhaled.\n\nCuomo said information from the companies will help the state\u2019s investigation into the illnesses.\n\nMessages left with the companies - California-based Honey Cut Labs, Floraplex Terpenes of Michigan and Massachusetts-based Mass Terpenes - were not immediately returned on Monday.\n\nIn New York state, 41 cases of severe pulmonary illness have been reported in patients age 15 to 46 who said they were using a cannabis-containing vape device before they were stricken.\n\nSo far no one who uses a regulated vaping device as part of New York\u2019s medical marijuana program have reported problems. Nonetheless, state health officials caution patients to discuss possible alternatives to vaping with their health care provider.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New York state will require health warning signs in shops that sell vaping devices following hundreds of cases of lung illnesses believed to be related to the habit, Gov.
