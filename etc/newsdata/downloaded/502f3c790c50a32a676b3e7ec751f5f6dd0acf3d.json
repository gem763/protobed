Mike Wallace.\n\nThe unknown male DNA from Bey's body matched the mystery suspect in Gunther and Green's killings, said Capri, and investigators in Daytona Beach and Palm Beach County began working together.\n\nPalm Beach County Sheriff\n\nThough they had DNA matches, the suspect's name was not known. That's when investigators used genetic genealogy, which led to Sunday's arrest of Hayes, authorities said.\n\nGenetic genealogy compares unknown DNA evidence to public genetic databases to identify suspects through their family members -- and has been called a \"game-changer\" in the effort to crack cold cases.\n\nSince the arrest of the suspected \"Golden State Killer\" in April 2018, at least 70 suspects have been identified through the technology, according to CeCe Moore, the chief genealogist at Parabon NanoLabs, which investigated the Bey murder among others.\n\nMoore has appeared as an expert in ABC News \"20/20\" episodes and has been quoted in ABCNews.com articles.\n\nAuthorities did not elaborate on which relatives of Hayes were found through genealogy, but on Friday, investigators zeroed in on him. They collected a cigarette he had discarded, according to the probable cause affidavit.\n\nPalm Beach County Sheriffs Office\n\nThe sample was taken to a lab where officials found that the DNA from the cigarette matched the DNA from Bey's killing and from one of the Daytona Beach killings, according to the probable cause affidavit.\n\nPalm Beach County investigators arrested Hayes on Sunday for the first-degree murder of Bey.\n\nA separate killing of a woman, Stacey Gage, in January 2008 is being investigated to see if it's connected to the other four murders. There is no physical evidence, however, linking it to the other murders at this time, police said.\n\nHayes, meanwhile, has not been charged in any of the Daytona Beach cases, police said, but he is tied by DNA to Gunther and Green's slayings and is linked by forensic evidence to Patton's death.\n\nHe lived in the areas where Bey and the three Dayton Beach victims were last seen, according to the probable cause affidavit. It's believed he attended Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Capri said.\n\nIt is not clear how the victims and the suspect allegedly came into contact, authorities said. The victims seemed to be targeted randomly, Wallace said.\n\nHayes' criminal history only involves traffic-related offenses, Capri said.\n\nHayes made his first court appearance Monday morning and was held on no bond, authorities said. His public defender did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nBey's brothers traveled from out of state to attend Monday's press conference in Palm Beach County. Her family chose not to speak.\n\nThe State Attorney for Palm Beach County, Dave Aronberg, vowed to get \"justice\" for Bey.\n\nABC News' Ben Stein contributed to this report.", "description": "The suspect was arrested for allegedly killing a 35-year-old woman.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/robert-hayes1-ht-ml-190916_hpMain_v12x5_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
