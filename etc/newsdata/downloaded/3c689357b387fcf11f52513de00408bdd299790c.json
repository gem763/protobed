At WeWork, not going public may have brought a worse fate.\n\nJust three days after withdrawing its registration for an initial public offering, WeWork informed staff of far-reaching job cuts to come by the end of the month, said people who attended the meeting. Three top executives delivered the news from a room at WeWork\u2019s New York headquarters Thursday afternoon. Although the executives didn\u2019t specify how many jobs were on the line, people familiar with the discussions have pegged the amount at about 2,000, representing some 16% of the global workforce. Deliberations are ongoing, and the number could change.\n\nSigns that the party is ending came in both subtle and more direct ways. Many staff meetings at WeWork, even somber ones, have an alcoholic beverage on hand. This one did not. An employee asked in the meeting whether the WeWork Global Summit, a celebrity-adorned event in Los Angeles that employees look forward to every year, would still take place in January. Executives said it would not.\n\nOther big-budget parties are probably also on the chopping block as expenses get reined in and corporate culture downshifts. WeWork has taken pride in the past in providing employees with outlandish corporate events, from lavish Halloween parties headlined by Wyclef Jean or summer camps in the English countryside featuring the singer Lorde.\n\nThe cost-cutting at WeWork\u2019s parent company, We Co., resembles what\u2019s happening now at Uber Technologies Inc. The ride-hailing company said it was cutting more than 800 employees this summer. It also eliminated celebratory balloons for staff anniversaries. Each company counts SoftBank Group Corp. as its largest shareholder, and each is deeply unprofitable. The difference is that Uber actually made it to the stock market.\n\nWeWork employees are accustomed to routine firings, unlike at the typical startup in growth mode. The nine-year-old company periodically trimmed the ranks, WeWork has said, to get rid of under-performers. It dismissed hundreds of employees in 2016 and held a staff meeting to discuss the move that concluded with a performance from a member of the hip-hop group Run-DMC. WeWork fired about 300 more this spring. Each time, WeWork said it would accelerate hiring after the cull. No such pronouncements were made this week. The job cuts will mean that some employees won\u2019t be able to live out the company\u2019s mantra of \u201cdo what you love.\u201d\n\nThis round looks to be something different, the start of a new era for the company. WeWork is still private, but it\u2019s not a startup anymore. Its spiritual leaders, Adam and Rebekah Neumann, left last week under pressure from investors. The third founder, Miguel McKelvey, stood Thursday alongside the new co-chief executive officers, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, where the topic of discussion was not the scourge of eating meat or elevating the world\u2019s consciousness. It was about divestitures, efforts to \u201cright-size\u201d the business and more measured growth.\n\nThe executives said they expect WeWork will continue to grow but at a slower pace, according to people who attended the meeting. The co-CEOs, after sending a message to customers Wednesday seeking to ease concerns about the business, told employees that clients and tenants were still interested in WeWork services. The executives urged staff to focus on the co-working business and its customers.\n\nIn the presentation, made available to all 12,500 or so WeWork employees, Minson apologized for the recent weeks of uncertainty. Executives didn\u2019t offer a solution for workers whose shares may be underwater based on recent valuation estimates from WeWork\u2019s financial advisers. They spoke broadly about selling off parts of the business but didn\u2019t give specifics. Privately, executives have explored a sale of several recent acquisitions, including Conductor, Managed by Q and Meetup, as well as a private jet and a large stake in the Wing, the female-focused co-working startup.\n\nWeWork and its ilk are finding that investors in public stocks aren\u2019t buying what works best in the private markets: high-growth, high-expense, high-minded brands. Lyft Inc., Peloton Interactive Inc. and Uber are all trading below their IPO prices. And making a show of cost-cutting may not be the formula to sell a new stock to public investors, who are looking for a growth story. Since news of the first round of summer job cuts, Uber\u2019s stock has fallen 32%.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Startup workers often worry that going public means the fun is about to end\u2014quarterly financial reports, disciplined spending, cheaper coffee.
