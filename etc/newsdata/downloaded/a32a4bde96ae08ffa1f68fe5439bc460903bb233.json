[\u2026] Other information Trump discussed provided America\u2019s enemies with tactical details on how the military carries out a raid like the one on al-Baghdadi, officials said, including the robot, the helicopter flight patterns and how U.S. forces entered the compound.\n\nWhen Donald Trump announced the demise of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS, the president made a variety of comments \u2013 about the mission, about his background, about his record, etc. \u2013 that were plainly false. NBC News\u2019 Courtney Kube and Carol E. Lee reported last night , however, that many of the other details \u201cwere either highly classified or tactically sensitive, and their disclosure by the president made intelligence and military officials cringe, according to current and former U.S. officials.\u201d\n\nThere was, of course, a degree of irony to the circumstances: while the president was casually throwing around highly sensitive information, to the consternation of national security professionals, he was also complaining about \u201cleaks\u201d and others\u2019 inability to show discretion with classified materials.\n\nBut stepping back, the broader issue isn\u2019t just the carelessness Trump showed on Sunday morning; it\u2019s also the frequency with which he\u2019s mishandled sensitive national security information.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s reached the point at which I came up with a Top 10 list.\n\nHere\u2019s my entirely subjective rundown of the most egregious examples of Trump and his team saying far more than necessary about information that shouldn\u2019t have been disclosed.\n\n10. In May 2017, Trump had a chat with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in which the Republican shared information about dispatching two nuclear submarines off the coast of the Korean peninsula. By one account, Pentagon officials were \u201cin shock\u201d over Trump\u2019s willingness to share such information. \u201cWe never talk about subs!\u201d three officials told BuzzFeed News, referring to the military\u2019s belief that keeping submarines\u2019 movements secret is key to their mission.\n\n9. Trump has refused to give up his unsecured smart phones, which creates additional security risks.\n\n8. In September 2017, the Trump administration divulged sensitive information about the terrorists behind the Manchester Arena bombing, infuriating the British government.\n\n7. In September 2019, during a photo-op at an event along the U.S./Mexico border, the president seemed eager to boast to reporters about detailed technological advancements in border security. It fell to Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the acting head of the Army Corps, to interject, \u201cSir, there could be some merit in not discussing that.\u201d\n\n6. In February 2018, Trump ignored the pleas of many U.S. officials and recklessly declassified information from the so-called \u201cNunes Memo\u201d in the hopes of advancing a partisan scheme.\n\n5. In February 2017, Trump discussed sensitive details about North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile tests with the prime minister of Japan at a Mar-a-Lago dining area, in view of wealthy civilians/customers.\n\n4. Earlier this month, Trump publicly discussed American nuclear weapons in Turkey, something U.S. officials have traditionally avoided disclosing and/or confirming.\n\n3. In August 2019, Trump published a tweet about a failed Iranian launch, which included a detailed photo. As MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell reported, it wasn\u2019t long before observers expressed concern about Trump possibly releasing classified material.\n\n2. Over the weekend, Trump blurted out all kinds of tactical and operational details about the al-Baghdadi mission.\n\n1. Just four months into Trump\u2019s presidency, he welcomed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kislyak into the Oval Office \u2013 at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 for a visit that was never fully explained.\n\nIt was in this meeting that Trump revealed highly classified information to his Russian guests for no apparent reason. The Washington Post reported at the time, \u201cThe information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government, officials said.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal added, \u201cAccording to one U.S. official, the information shared was highly sensitive and difficult to acquire and was considered extraordinarily valuable.\u201d\n\nAt this point, I imagine some of the president\u2019s detractors might suggest curtailing his access to intelligence briefings, but that\u2019s probably an unnecessary call: by all accounts, Trump often skips his intelligence briefings anyway.", "description": "The broader issue isn't just the carelessness Trump showed on Sunday morning; it's also the frequency with which he's mishandled sensitive information.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_hallie_brk_trump_financial_191011_1920x1080.jpg?itok=vkG06OP9", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
