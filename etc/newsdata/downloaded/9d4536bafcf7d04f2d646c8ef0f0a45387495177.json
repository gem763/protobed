It was a smart move because now the story is basically over.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looked tired,\u201d the source adds.\n\nA rep for Affleck did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe night before, the father of three, 47, was spotted attending the UNICEF Masquerade Ball in West Hollywood.\n\nIn a video obtained by TMZ of Saturday night\u2019s event, Affleck seemed to have trouble walking while leaving his hotel for the ball.
