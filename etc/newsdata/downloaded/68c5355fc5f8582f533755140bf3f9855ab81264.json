We suspect now is the point you\u2019ll immediately want to start looking up prices for your spare kidney, because this you have to see.\n\nThe company is called Lunaz \u2013 named after founder David Lorenz\u2019s daughter Luna, for which this quote perhaps best sums it all up. \u201cFor my daughter not to have access to a car like the Mercedes-Benz 190SL when she is of driving age would be a tragedy,\u201d he said. Same.\n\nLorenz was struck with the idea of terraforming classics while waiting on the side of the road for a repair. \u201cI wanted a car like a 1953 Jaguar to be my daily driver,\u201d he said. Indeed, the company\u2019s first offering will be exactly that: the hand-bitingly pretty 1953 Jaguar XK120.\n\nThe process starts with a thorough inspection of the entire car, following by weighing each corner to assess the original\u2019s car\u2019s weight distribution (which will later feed into the chassis set-up). Then, the engine and drivetrain are ripped out.\n\nLunaz then 3D scans the entire thing in order to deploy the company\u2019s \u201cclosely guarded\u201d electric propulsion tech. The whole car is stripped, body defects mended by hand, and everything built back up again. Including modern stuff like sat nav, wifi, infotainment and such like.\n\nThe Jag will feature an 80kWh battery pack and twin motors, producing the equivalent of 375bhp and 516lb ft of torque. Should suffice. It\u2019ll be able to fast-charge, feature regenerative braking and conveniences like cruise and traction control.\n\nLunaz is also readying a 1961 Rolls-Royce Phantom V with a 120kWh battery (and later, a 1956 Rolls-Royce Cloud); indeed, there\u2019ll be different batteries dependant on the \u201ccharacter\u201d of each individual car. FYI, Lunaz\u2019s technical boss is former Renault F1 director Jon Hilton, who helped Fernando Alonso win two F1 championships, and the company is headquartered at Silverstone.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get stuff like air conditioning, better heating systems, uprated brakes, suspension and steering, and Lunaz will ensure the usability of each car isn\u2019t compromised \u2013 the fuel filler cap for example, will be where you top up the electricity.\n\nNaturally, such craftsmanship demands a premium: prices start at \u00a3350,000 excluding taxes. And of course, Lunaz isn\u2019t the only game in town, either: Jaguar itself modifies the E-type with electricity. Aston does the same for the DB6, too.\n\nThe more the merrier, then. \u201cThese cars will be true to the original in their aesthetic, peerless in their performance and effortless in their day-to-day use,\u201d explains Hilton. \u201cTo breathe new life into these classics represents vital engineering in the purest sense.\u201d\n\nNow, about that kidney\u2026", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.topgear.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_1280w/public/images/news-article/2019/10/28a65e36a7caa8bb5c1fd064d077950f/xk120_by_lunaz.jpg?itok=y416mXcV", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
