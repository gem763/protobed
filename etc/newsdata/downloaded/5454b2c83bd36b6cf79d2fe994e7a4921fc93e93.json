I, too, would be wondering how to accept Bitcoins in my store.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can do it.\n\nCreate a Bitcoin address to be able to accept Bitcoins in your store\n\nFirst, you need a wallet to receive your Bitcoins. Right after you create your wallet, most of them will let you generate an address that you can show on your website or store, and tell people to send their coins to that one. After you start earning BTC, you can either keep them and wait for them to appreciate in value or send them to an exchange to cash out. The exchange services do charge fees, though.\n\nPopular crypto platforms that let you trade your fiat for cryptocurrencies include:\n\nUsing a Bitcoin payment processor to accept BTC\n\nOne of the easiest ways to accept Bitcoin in your store is to use a payment processor with existing point-of-sale integration. You don\u2019t need to know anything about Bitcoin or technology to use this option. Companies offering such services can even deposit the money in your bank account in your preferred currency once the Bitcoin payment has been made. Keep in mind that they do charge fees, though.\n\nPopular Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment processors include:\n\nCoinGate\n\nBitPay\n\nDC POS\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinPayments\n\nBlockchain.info\n\nSpectroCoin\n\nCoinify\n\nCoinsBank\n\nBlockonomics\n\nGoUrl.io\n\nBe sure to compare their fees and select the one that is the most compatible with the rules and regulations of your jurisdiction.\n\nAdvertise that your store accepts Bitcoin\n\nPeople can\u2019t pay you in Bitcoin if they don\u2019t know you will take it. There are websites, such as coinmap.org (only for physical stores) or spendbitcoins.com that will list your business as a Bitcoin-friendly service. You can also add a Bitcoin logo to your website, preferably one that says \u201cBitcoin accepted here.\u201d\n\nBitcoin accepted here sign.
