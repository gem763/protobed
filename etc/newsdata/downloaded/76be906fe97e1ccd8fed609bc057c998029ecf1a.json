Sony has confirmed that the Playstation 5 will release in 'Holiday 2020', pitting it directly against main gaming hardware rival Microsoft as it releases its next Xbox - currently known as Project Scarlett - in the same period.\n\nThe release date news comes as Sony revealed yet more technical detail on its next-generation console in an interview with Wired. The PS5 will have a controller equipped with haptic feedback on its triggers and grips, aimed at replicating the 'feel' of environments in your hands. When walking across different surfaces in an action-adventure or platform game, for example, or driving between racetrack and dirt on a racer.\n\nThere was also more information on the difference that the 'solid state drive' (SSD) -which both the PS5 and Project Scarlett will feature- can make to modern gaming.\n\nIt has been a rather unusual way to reveal a console thus far for Sony; far from the glitz of the PS4\u2019s New York event reveal or the amplification of the E3 trade show; the setting where Microsoft revealed Project Scarlett in June.\n\nInstead, Sony has drip-fed technical details via two Wired articles and offered the odd nugget of information at investor meetings. Nevertheless, it has given us a fascinating glimpse into the future that the next-generation consoles will offer. Here is everything we know so far.", "description": "The next-generation of the video game console wars has a start date.", "authors": ["Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gaming/2018/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000166089944-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVoIKGfcs2bznKfYQ0bYYyMIBy5thgbX1e70NAP3vAsU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2018-10-09"}
