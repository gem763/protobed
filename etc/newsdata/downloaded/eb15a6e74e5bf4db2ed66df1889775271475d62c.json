You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.\u201d\n\nDays before Gabbard appeared on the debate stage in Ohio, she had threatened to boycott the event, because she believes the DNC is rigged against outsider candidates such as herself. She declared that the Democratic National Committee and the \u201ccorporate media\u201d were \u201ctrying to hijack the entire election process.\u201d\n\nAmong other reasons, Gabbard argued that the polls the DNC chose for certifying the candidates for the November debate were not as accurate as many of the non-certified polls that could actually help her qualify. So far, the only candidates who have qualified for November are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nBut the media smears, and the evident bias of the debate hosts, were the driving force.\n\nTwo days after Gabbard\u2019s threat, the New York Times published what she called \u201c a greatest hits smear piece.\u201d Gabbard later noted: \u201cThese are the folks who will be acting as the neutral questioners/moderators of Tuesday\u2019s debate lol!\u201d\n\nAt the debate itself, Gabbard took aim at the hosts: \u201cJust two days ago the New York Times put out an article saying that I\u2019m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I\u2019m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.\u201d\n\nIt was actually very kind of Gabbard to not mention the name attached to the CNN smear. Bakari Sellers said hours before the event that he firmly believed that Tulsi is a \u2018puppet for the Russian government.\u201d\n\nThe fact is that Gabbard, a reservist in the U.S. Army National Guard who took time off her campaign to drill with her unit this summer, is more cautious about the use of military force than other candidates. For that, she is being attacked as a traitor.\n\nBut it is a stance that has appeal to members of both parties who are weary of interventionist foreign policies.\n\nAnother political outsider, former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), is a Tulsi Gabbard fan. Paul praised Gabbard when he said, \u201cShe\u2019s the most intelligent and would be the best. \u201c He also said, \u201cIf we had to pick one of them [Democrats] to be our president I think she would be giving us the best chance as for bringing about peace.\u201d\n\nGabbard is a proud veteran who founded and is the co-chair of the Congressional Post 9/11 Veteran Caucus, which demonstrates her continual work in defending the work her military brothers and sisters continue to do to fight for their country.\n\nAt the debate, when Gabbard calmly asked if she could ask Warren a question, she was cut off. Silenced by the very media who smeared her, as if to protect Warren.\n\nYet Gabbard, as after the second debate, was the most googled candidate after the candidates left the stage.\n\nApparently American want to hear more from Tulsi despite the smears. The Times called Gabbard\u2019s supporters \u201cunusual Americans\u201d; that has now become a rallying cry.\n\nThese \u201cUnusual Amerians\u201d include the \u201dunconventional mix of anti-interventionist progressives, libertarians, [and] contrarian culture-war skeptics\u2026\u201d that the Times mocked as Gabbard\u2019s base by associating them with extremists.\n\nGibbered delivered a powerful response in her closing statement at the debate: \u201cI don\u2019t see deplorables. I see fellow Americans worthy of respect even when we disagree strongly.\u201d\n\nGabbard\u2019s use of the word \u201cdeplorables\u201d was a clear allusion Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d a phrase that the former secretary of state used to tarnish her opponent\u2019s supporters back in 2016. It came back to haunt Clinton \u2014 as will her declaration that Gabbard is Russia\u2019s favorite.\n\nGabbard, unlike Clinton and many of the presidential hopefuls in 2020, has sacrificed for her country through her military service in a combat zone, and understands the cost of war from first-hand experience.\n\nThat is the simple secret of her appeal. It is amazing how far the corporate media and the party establishment will go in their attempt to stop that message from breaking through.\n\nNancy Kaufman is a reporter for Los Angeles-area progressive radio station KPFK and taught high school English in the LAUSD for 20 years.
