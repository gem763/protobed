There was trash on the sidewalk, broken glass in the window casements.\n\n\u201cShould be right around the corner,\u201d Reed replied, squinting down at the Seattle map he\u2019d printed out that morning.\n\nI glanced toward a group of shabbily dressed young men huddled in the doorway of a large building. \u201cSomehow I think I expected something a little more\u2026I don\u2019t know, modern?\u201d\n\nAdapted from \u201cThat Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea\u201d by Marc Randolph, the co-founder and first CEO of Netflix.\n\n\u201cThere it is,\u201d Reed said, pointing to a rundown four-story brick building. He seemed less certain now. Leaning in toward one of the tall windows, I could just see into the dimly lit lobby. On the wall, behind a faded wood desk, was a large sign reading Amazon.com .\n\nIt was the summer of 1998. DVDs had been in the U.S. market for a little over a year, and Netflix , the e-commerce company Reed Hastings and I had co-founded to sell and rent them through the mail, had been live for just over two months. I was the company\u2019s CEO, Reed its largest investor.\n\nReed Hastings, left, and Marc Randolph celebrate in a plane after Netflix's IPO on May 23, 2002.

The bad news was that we weren\u2019t making much money. And what little money we were making was coming almost entirely from DVD sales, not rentals. I feared that once others started selling DVDs, our margins would shrink to nothing.\n\nSo when Joy Covey, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, called Reed to see if we would be interested in coming up to Seattle to meet with her and Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and CEO, I felt a mixture of both fear and hope.\n\nAmazon was only a few years old, but Bezos had already decided his site wouldn\u2019t just be a bookstore. It was going to be an everything store. And we knew that music and video were going to be his next two targets.\n\nWe\u2019d also heard that Bezos planned to use a good chunk of the $54 million raised during his company\u2019s 1997 IPO to finance an aggressive acquisition of smaller companies.\n\nJeff Bezos poses for a portrait in 1997 in Seattle.

I wasn\u2019t quite ready to hand over the keys. But when Amazon calls, you pick up the phone. Even if it\u2019s 1998, and Amazon is nowhere near the powerhouse it is today.\n\nThe building Reed and I entered certainly didn\u2019t look like it belonged to a powerhouse. The reception area was cluttered and dusty. On the desk was a telephone with a printed directory of numbers. Reed leaned over, squinted and dialed.\n\nWithin seconds, Joy swept into the lobby. She was younger than either of us. But she was already a respected businesswoman, a dynamo who had taken Amazon public just 12 months earlier, convincing skeptical investment bankers that a company that wasn\u2019t remotely profitable was worth $20 billion.\n\nAs Covey led us back into the warren of cubicles that made up the Amazon offices, it was hard for me to believe that this was the company inventing e-commerce. The carpeting was stained. There were multiple people per cubicle, desks under the stairs, desks pushed to the edges of hallways. Almost every horizontal surface was covered: by books, gaping Amazon boxes, printouts, coffee cups, plates and pizza boxes. It made the Netflix offices seem like the executive suite at IBM.\n\nWe could hear Jeff Bezos before we saw him. He-huh-huh-huh-huh. Jeff has a\u2026distinctive laugh. If you\u2019ve seen any video of him speaking, you\u2019ll have heard a version of it\u2014but not the true, untamed thing. Now it\u2019s polite, a little giggly. But back then, it was explosive, loud, hiccupping. He laughed the way that Barney Rubble laughs on \u201cThe Flintstones.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think both companies would have evolved had Amazon acquired Netflix in 1998? Join the conversation below.\n\nHe was in his office, just hanging up the phone when we walked in. His desk, and the desks of the two other people he shared the office with, were made of doors mounted atop 4 \u00d7 4 wooden legs, braced with triangular metal pieces. I suddenly realized that every desk I\u2019d seen in that office was the same.\n\nBezos was wearing pressed khaki pants and a crisp blue oxford shirt. Behind him, hanging from an exposed pipe in the ceiling, four or five identical pressed blue oxford shirts fluttered in the breeze from an oscillating fan.\n\nAfter introductions, we filed into a corner of the building with a bigger table. This table, too, was made from recycled doors. I could clearly see where the holes that used to hold the doorknobs had been patched.\n\n\u201cOK, Jeff,\u201d I said, grinning. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the doors?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deliberate message,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of saying that we spend money on things that affect our customers, not on things that don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNetflix was the same way, I told him. We didn\u2019t even provide chairs.\n\nBezos was notoriously frugal. He was famous for his \u201ctwo-pizza meetings\u201d\u2014the idea being that if it took more than two pizzas to feed a group of people working on a problem, then you had hired too many people. People worked long hours for him, and they didn\u2019t get paid a lot.\n\nBut Bezos inspired loyalty. He\u2019s one of those geniuses\u2014like Steve Jobs, or like Reed\u2014whose peculiarities only add to his legend. In Jeff\u2019s case, his legendary intelligence and notorious nerdiness mix into a kind of contagious enthusiasm.\n\nHe peppered me with questions about Netflix. How could I know that I had every DVD? What did I expect the ratio of sales to rentals to be? But he was most excited about the stories about launch day\u2014particularly, the story of the bell we had rigged up to mark each new order.\n\nNetflix employee Hector Comancho moves boxes of ready-to-be-shipped DVDs in January 2002 in San Jose, Calif.

I had to stop everyone from rushing over to the computer screens to see if they knew the customers.\u201d\n\nWe traded beta names: he laughed at Kibble, the name we had used before Netflix\u2019s launch, and told me that Amazon had originally called itself Cadabra. \u201cThe problem is that Cadabra sounds a little too much like cadaver,\u201d Bezos said, barking out a laugh.\n\nAlthough Amazon was still relatively small in 1998, it already had over 600 employees and was doing more than $150 million in revenue. But as Jeff and I chatted about our launch days, I could see in his face that in many ways he missed those simpler, more exciting times.\n\nReed, on the other hand, has never been someone who dwells, at all, on the past. He was impatiently jogging his leg up and down. He wanted, I knew, to direct the conversation to how Netflix could potentially fit with what Amazon was doing.\n\nI was just about to brief Jeff and Joy on key members of our team, when Reed decided he\u2019d had enough.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to go through all this,\u201d he said, exasperated. \u201cWhat does this have to do with Netflix and Amazon and possible ways we can work together?\u201d\n\nReed Hastings holds a ready-to-be-shipped DVD in 2002.

It was quiet.\n\n\u201cReed,\u201d I said after a few seconds. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Amazon is considering using Netflix to jump-start their entry into video. Our people would be a huge part of any possible acquisition.\u201d\n\nI was relieved when Joy jumped in to help. \u201cReed,\u201d she said, \u201ccan you help me understand a bit better how you\u2019re thinking about your unit economics?\u201d\n\nWith obvious relief that we were finally on topic, Reed began running Joy through the numbers.\n\nAn hour later, after Bezos had headed back to his office, Joy lingered behind to wrap things up. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed with what you\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d she started, \u201cand I think there is lots of potential for a strong partnership to jump-start our entry into video. But\u2026\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a \u201cbut\u201d man. Nothing good ever comes of that word. This time was no exception.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Joy continued, \u201cif we elect to continue down this path, we\u2019re probably going to land somewhere in the low eight figures.\u201d\n\nWhen someone uses \u201clow eight figures,\u201d that means barely eight figures. That means probably something between $14 million and $16 million.\n\nThat would have been a pretty good outcome for me, since at the time, I owned about 30% of the company. Thirty percent of $15 million is a pretty nice return for 12 months of work\u2014particularly when your wife is broadly hinting that it might be time to pull the kids out of private school, sell the house, and move to Montana.\n\nBut for Reed, it wasn\u2019t enough. He owned the other 70% of the company, but he\u2019d also invested $2 million in it. And he was fresh off the sale of Pure Atria, the company formed out of his first software venture. He was already an \u201ceight-figure guy.\u201d A high-eight-figure guy.\n\nOn the plane ride home, we discussed the pros and cons. The pros? We\u2019d find a solution for our biggest problems: We weren\u2019t making any money. We didn\u2019t have a repeatable, scalable or profitable business model. We were doing plenty of business, most of it through DVD sales, but our costs were high. It was expensive to buy DVDs, to ship them and to give away thousands of them in promotions, hoping that we\u2019d convert one-time users into return customers.\n\nAnd of course there was the bigger problem: If we didn\u2019t sell to Amazon, we would soon be competing with it. So long, DVD sales. So long, Netflix.\n\nSelling now would solve all those problems\u2014or at least it would hand them off to a larger company with deeper pockets.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nWe were also on the brink of something. We had a working website. We had a smart team. We had deals in place with a handful of DVD manufacturers. We had figured out how to source virtually every DVD currently available. We were unquestionably the best source on the internet for DVDs.\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem like the right moment to give up.\n\nSome of the Netflix employees outside their offices on IPO day in 2002. Photo: Bill Kunz\n\n\u201cListen, Marc,\u201d Reed said as we watched Mount Rainier scroll by outside the window. \u201cThis business has real potential. I think we could make more on this than on the Pure Atria deal.\u201d\n\nI nodded in agreement. Then I chose that moment to tell Reed we should abandon the only profitable part of our business.\n\n\u201cWe just have to figure out some way to get out of selling DVDs,\u201d I said to him. \u201cDoing rental and sales is confusing for our customers and unnecessarily complex for ops. And if we don\u2019t sell, Amazon will destroy us when they enter the field. I think we get out now. Focus on rental.\u201d\n\nReed arched his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cKinda puts all our eggs in one basket,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only way to make sure you don\u2019t break any,\u201d I replied.\n\nOne of the key lessons I learned at Netflix was the necessity of focus. At a startup, it\u2019s hard enough to get a single thing right, much less a whole bunch of things. Especially if the things you are trying to do are not only dissimilar but actively impede each other.\n\nReed agreed with me. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we get funding this summer, that\u2019ll buy us some time. It\u2019s a difficult problem.\u201d\n\nHe frowned, but I could tell he was pleased to have something new to chew on.\n\n\u201cWhat percentage of revenue comes from rental right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cRoughly 3%,\u201d I said, signaling to the flight attendant for a much-needed gin and tonic.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s horrible,\u201d Reed said. \u201cBut sales are a Band-Aid. If we rip it off\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we have to focus on the wound,\u201d I said, squeezing my lime into the drink.\n\nWe went back and forth like this for the rest of the plane ride, and it was only when we landed that I realized we hadn\u2019t actually formally decided not to take Bezos\u2019s offer. Without deciding, we\u2019d decided: We weren\u2019t ready to sell.\n\nWe agreed that Reed would let Amazon down lightly\u2014and politely. In the future, we\u2019d be better off having Amazon as a friend, not an enemy.\n\nIn the meantime, we needed to figure out a way to get people renting from us.\n\nAdapted from \u201cThat Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea\u201d by Marc Randolph, the co-founder and first CEO of Netflix.
