REUTERS/Stefica Bikes\n\nBlustery conditions meant visitors were stopped from making an early morning climb and authorities said they will reassess during the day whether or not to reopen.\n\nThe UNESCO World Heritage-listed 348-metre (1,142-ft) monolith, formerly known as Ayers Rock, is a top tourist draw in Australia despite its remote desert location near Alice Springs in the Northern Territory.\n\nWhile most visitors do not climb Uluru\u2019s steep, red-ochre flanks, the impending Oct. 26 ban has triggered an upsurge in people taking advantage of a final opportunity to make the trek.\n\nThe Anangu people, the traditional owners of Uluru, have called for the climb to be closed since 1985, when the park was returned to indigenous control. The Anangu say Uluru has deep spiritual significance as a route their ancestors took.\n\nKelly Derks, from the Australian city of Melbourne, said she wanted to climb Uluru while at the same time respect indigenous beliefs.\n\n\u201cWe respect that, we climb but we don\u2019t leave rubbish, we stay to the path,\u201d said Derks.\n\nDozens of people have died while climbing Uluru, from falls and dehydration.\n\nSonita Vinecombe, from the Australian city of Adelaide, said the impending ban prompted her to come to Uluru.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t planning to come anytime soon, but because it\u2019s the last day we are here,\u201d she said.\n\nNearly 400,000 visitors flocked to the Australian landmark in the year to end-June, government data shows.\n\nThe closure was announced two years ago when fewer than 20 percent of visitors were making the climb.\n\nTo commemorate the climbing ban the park will conduct public celebrations over the weekend.\n\n\u201cIt is an extremely important place, not a playground or theme park like Disneyland,\u201d Anangu senior traditional owner Sammy Wilson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe welcome tourists here. Closing the climb is not something to feel upset about, but a cause for celebration.\u201d", "description": "Hundreds of tourists formed long queues to climb Australia's Uluru soon after dawn on Friday, the day before a permanent ban on the climb takes effect following a decades-long fight by indigenous people to close the trek.", "authors": ["Stefica Nicol Bikes", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444668854&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N259", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
