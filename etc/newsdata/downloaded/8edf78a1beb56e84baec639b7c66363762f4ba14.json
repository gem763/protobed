Last month, it was Walmart (NYSE: ) suing the electric car-maker ,blaming its faulty batteries for causing a fire in at least seven of its stores. And who knows what\u2019s in the cards for September.\n\nBut amid this never-ending cycle of setbacks, Tesla shares have surged, in a rebound that started in June. Despite the occasional dip, such as yesterday's, when the stock closed down 0.3% at $225.01, shares have gained more than 22% in the past three months at a time when the benchmark saw highly volatile trading and investors shunned growth stocks.\n\nTesla price chart\n\nAnd yet, Tesla shares are still down more than 30% this year, hurt by a series of missteps and on concerns that the car-maker is finding it hard to grow the order book for its electric cars and balance its accounts.\n\nThe recent rally could prove short-lived given the boom-and-bust pattern of Tesla shares, however it shows one positive change: investors are increasingly buying into CEO Elon Musk\u2019s new narrative that emphasizes the expansion of its production capacity and model lineup, rather than the achievement of bottom-line profitability.\n\nTesla is now targeting break-even in the current quarter, after the car maker a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss in July. The company is eyeing a return to profitability during the last three months of the year.\n\nVolume Growth, Capacity Expansion\n\nIn a letter to shareholders in July, Musk emphasised that \u201ccontinuous volume growth, capacity expansion and cash generation will remain the main focus,\u201d adding that Tesla is working to expand its \u201cmanufacturing footprint in new regions, launching new products and continuing to improve the customer experience while generating and using cash sustainably.\u201d\n\nWith that rhetoric, investors are luckily seeing some positive developments on the ground that are helping the stock to sustain the momentum. Last week, Tesla won an exemption from a 10% purchase tax on the vehicles it sells in China, despite trade tensions between the country and the U.S.\n\nThe exemption, which is aimed at domestic makers of electric vehicles, benefits all Tesla models sold in China. The company currently imports all of the cars it sells in the Asian country, but plans to make the Model 3, its best-selling vehicle, at its new China plant which is likely to start production late this year.\n\nIn Europe, demand for the Model 3 sedan has been steady, and should help offset some weakness seen in China, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a recent note. These positive comments coincide with Moody\u2019s Investors Service\u2019s recent assessment of the company\u2019s credit outlook, stating that it has changed from negative to stable. The reason cited is an improvement in the Model 3 production systems.\n\n\u201cThe stable outlook anticipates that improving operating efficiencies of the Model 3, growing regulatory credit sales, and an adequate liquidity position will provide a sufficient runway to continue undertaking cost cutting initiatives that will improve profitability in the face of aggressive expansion plans,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a note on Tesla.\n\nWith this positive assessment, however, sales of the company\u2019s older and more profitable vehicles, the Model S and X, continue to be weak, hurting margins and cash generation. In the U.S., growth for these cars has stalled after a strong end to the second quarter, and Tesla would need to see a strong September order flow to hit its aggressive third-quarter guidance, according to Ives.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDespite some positive news flow in recent weeks, demand for its cars and the company\u2019s ability to make a profit are the two factors which will decide whether Tesla shares are a good long-term investment. If Tesla is able to turn the corner on these fronts quickly without the CEO generating more controversies, it will certainly provide a positive signal for its stock.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: S&P 500, Walmart Inc, Tesla Inc.
