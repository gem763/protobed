Will anyone follow?", "language": "en", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) - Ang Lee\u2019s conversion began with \u201cLife of Pi.\u201d\n\nIt was the director\u2019s first movie in 3-D, and he sweated anxiously over the implementation of the technology and the torturous process of adapting Yann Martel\u2019s fanciful and allegorical book set principally in a raft containing a 450-pound Bengal tiger.\n\nLee was excited, though, to challenge himself with, as he says, a new dimension. But an early trial - a test shot with a dancing Indian girl - was disappointing.\n\n\u201cI realized I couldn\u2019t see anything. I couldn\u2019t see her expression. There was so much jitter. I thought something was wrong with the camera,\u201d recalls Lee. \u201cI sort of freaked out. But I couldn\u2019t back out. That started my journey.\u201d\n\nThat journey has turned into one of the more unexpected and drastic left-hand turns of any filmmaker as highly regarded as Lee is. The director has long been a moving target, leaping from his native Taiwan (\u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d) to Jane Austen\u2019s England (\u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d) to Rick Moody\u2019s Connecticut (\u201cThe Ice Storm\u201d) to Chinese wuxia (\u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\u201d) to the Wyoming mountains (\u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d). But \u201cLife of Pi\u201d began a new quest for Lee.\n\nSince that 2012 film, a global smash with $609 million in ticket sales, Lee has dedicated himself to uncovering what he calls the aesthetics of 3-D and digital cinema. Those technologies, he believes, aren\u2019t minor new iterations to moviemaking but, if fully grasped, are a new medium entirely. Lee has, at 64, completely remade himself as a filmmaker. He\u2019s not even sure that term - \u201cfilmmaker\u201d - is quite right anymore.\n\n\u201cA lot of things we never ask. Why 24 frames? Where does that number come from? I began to question my faith, the religion I have, which is movies,\u201d says Lee. \u201cI went through a lot of mental crises.\u201d\n\nThis weekend, Lee will release into theaters the latest result of his newfound digital faith, \u201cGemini Man.\u201d It stars Will Smith as a government assassin who discovers his former mentor cloned him. Smith is pursued by a younger version of himself (a digital character crafted through motion-capture). Like Lee\u2019s previous film, the Iraq War veteran tale \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk,\u201d \u201dGemini Man\u201d was made with a frame rate of 120 frames-per-second and in 3-D.\n\nAnd like \u201cBilly Lynn,\u201d the response from critics has been brutal. Reviewers have criticized the film\u2019s uninspired story line but critics\u2019 primary contention is with the high-frame rate, or HFR. Lee isn\u2019t the only one to push the format. His HFR comrades include Peter Jackson and James Cameron - both directors more synonymous with technology than Lee.\n\nBut skepticism pervades for HFR, even among the studios that have backed it. As with Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d and \u201cBilly Lynn,\u201d only a small number of theaters will actually be screening \u201cGemini Man\u201d in 120 frames per second. In the U.S., it will be projected that way in 14 theaters, albeit not in the high-definition 4K it was made in.\n\nLee, though, remains a passionate convert.\n\n\u201cWhen I was testing \u2018Billy Lynn,\u2019 when I saw the 120 frames, I wished I was 20 years younger. I could see what\u2019s ahead of me, right away, in half a second,\u201d says Lee. \u201cHere I\u2019m in the third act of my career and I just found something I want to learn and change. That takes a lot of stamina.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cGemini Man,\u201d Lee has striven to recalibrate the entire production - the lighting, the production design, the performances - to suit the clarity of the disarmingly sharp HFR images. The results are radical - nothing looks like \u201cGemini Man\u201d - and there are occasional flashes of its potential benefits. You can see Lee playing with depth of field and perspective. The performances may seem flatter but have a gripping intimacy. Action sequences are incredibly detailed. There\u2019s imagery of crystalline splendor.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a pervasive hollowness to the movie and it remains to be seen if its hyperrealism is part of cinema\u2019s future or if it\u2019s inherently at odds with that thing we call movie magic. Watching a high-frame-rate movie can be like seeing that the emperor has no clothes.\n\nLee isn\u2019t claiming victory. He knows he\u2019s trying to build a new filmic language for eyes not accustomed to its lucidity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long journey,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m on the third one. It\u2019s been 10 years. I feel like I just scratched the surface, like a digital human.\u201d\n\nJames Schamus, the former Focus Features chief and Lee\u2019s longtime collaborator as a writer and producer, says the reactions to \u201cGemini Man\u201d and \u201cBilly Lynn\u201d have not gone unnoticed. But he hopes Lee perseveres in trying to expand cinema, the history of which has always been propelled by technological advancement. With audiences increasingly inclined to stay home, such a breakthrough could remake the theatrical experience.\n\n\u201cAng is somebody who\u2019s always departing for a further shore,\u201d says Schamus. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing this since he was a kid. If, when you see Ang, you\u2019re not seeing the back of his head - because he\u2019s moving somewhere further that you don\u2019t know where it is - then you haven\u2019t been seeing Ang. That\u2019s who he is. And that\u2019s who he always will be.\u201d\n\n\u201cGemini Man\u201d arrives in theaters just ahead of another New York filmmaker\u2019s digitally re-aged creation: Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Irishman.\u201d The effects that went into crafting a younger Will Smith aren\u2019t the same as those used for Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, but Lee is curious to compare notes with Scorsese. Both are on the board of the Film Foundation, the non-profit dedicated to film preservation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give him a call pretty soon. You show yours, I\u2019ll show mine,\u201d says Lee, chuckling. \u201cI revere him. We used the same sound crew. Sometimes we heard a little bit what\u2019s going on on the other set. I\u2019m looking forward talking to him to see how the experience differs and what we can learn from each other.\u201d\n\nAn education is what Lee is after, as quick as possible. Coaxing audiences along with him hasn\u2019t been easy, and this isn\u2019t an inexpensive quest. \u201cGemini Man,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release, was made for about $140 million. \u201cBilly Lynn\u201d grossed a disappointing $30.9 million worldwide for Sony Pictures.\n\n\u201cI hope people understand this is a very hard task,\u201d says Lee. \u201cWe tried really hard. Every movie, I like to think, is an experiment. We try something, we see if it works.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ang Lee's conversion began with \"Life of Pi.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Coyle"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/la_premiere_of__gemini_man__31044_c0-133-5320-3234_s1770x1032.jpg?16a782d102bd14cf91473d114694380097f3cd97", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
