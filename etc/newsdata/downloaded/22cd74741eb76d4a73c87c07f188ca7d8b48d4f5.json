The HIV cases are the result of intravenous drug use and unprotected sex,\" Namaki said, adding the ministry is committed to conducting tests and treating those infected free of cost.\n\n'Statistically unthinkable'\n\nA senior official at the health ministry said the diabetes-screening programme was conducted during the summer and the nurse administered the blood tests using disposable kits, which are completely safe.\n\n\"The rumour spread due to lack of awareness among people in the village regarding HIV and the ways of its transmission,\" he said on condition of anonymity because of restrictions on speaking to the media.\n\n\"It is medically and statistically unthinkable that a single contaminated syringe will infect 300 people,\" he added.\n\nDeputy Health Minister Alireza Raeisi told state-run news agency IRNA the ministry conducted HIV tests on 1,400 people in Chenar Mahmoudi and found 70 positive cases, many of them infected years ago.\n\nHowever, villagers accused the health authorities of using contaminated needles for blood tests.\n\n\"The health ministry came to our village for free blood sugar and insulin tests,\" a resident of Chenar Mahmoud was quoted as saying by Iran Human Rights Monitor, adding the syringes were infected with an \"unknown virus\".\n\nVideo has circulated online showing people protesting and clashing with local police. Iranian parliamentarians have demanded a report on the clashes.\n\n\"The situation has been brought under control by the police, but the anger is simmering inside,\" Abdullah Haidari, a journalist from Lordegan, told Anadolu Agency.\n\n\"It may be true that the infections were prior to the diabetes-screening programme, but it is the job of health officials to conduct awareness program about HIV and its prevention,\" Haidari added.\n\nAccording to UNAIDS 2018 report, a total of 61,000 people are living with HIV in Iran with 4,400 new infections and 2,600 deaths resulting from the deadly virus.", "description": "The health ministry dismissed reports an alleged outbreak was caused by a contaminated syringe used by a local nurse.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/e0a4dc6d1be4456cbd3f56b600c34b52_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
