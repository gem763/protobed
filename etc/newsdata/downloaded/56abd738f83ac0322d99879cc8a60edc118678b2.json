Mitt Romney (R-UT) said he felt \u201cembarrassed\u201d to be labeled a \u201clurker\u201d after confirming he has a secret Twitter account.\n\nA transcript of the exchange is as follows:\n\nMIKE ALLEN: There\u2019s some question whether you follow President Trump. Your official account follows President Trump.\n\nSEN. MITT ROMNEY: I have two official accounts \u2014 one is a Senate account and the other is the Mitt Romney account and those accounts are not ones I look at regularly. I do follow them, but I have an anonymous account, which is the one that I look at two or three times a day.\n\nALLEN: Oh, so you\u2019re a lurker?\n\nSEN. ROMNEY: Is that what they\u2019re called? I\u2019m embarrassed to be called a lurker. I\u2019ve been called a lot of things, but being called a lurker is a new low.\n\nThe exchange between Romney and Allen comes after The Atlantic published an expos\u00e9 on Sunday about the Utah senator in which he revealed he maintains a private Twitter account for the purpose of keeping up on the news.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t give you the name of it,\u201d the lawmaker told the magazine, before adding that he follows 668 people.\n\nHours later, Slate\u2019s Ashley Feinberg published an article declaring that she was all but certain that she had found the account. The Atlantic then reached out to Romney to asked whether the account \u2014 named \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d \u2014 was, in fact, his.\n\nHe simply replied: \u201cC\u2019est moi,\u201d which is French for \u201cit\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nRomney used the Twitter account to defend himself against detractors, including Fox News analyst Brit Hume and former CNN anchor Soledad O\u2019Brien, who criticized the lawmaker for lacking a \u201cmoral compass.\u201d The account has since been made private.", "description": "Sen.
