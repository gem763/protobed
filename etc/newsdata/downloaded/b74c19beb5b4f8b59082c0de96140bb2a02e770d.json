While they didn\u2019t hit the commercial peaks of the bands they influenced with their spots on the Drive OST and 2012\u2019s Kill for Love, their elusiveness sustained the intrigue: follow-up Dear Tommy was due in 2014 but remains unreleased.\n\nIn its place is surprise album Closer to Grey. Chromatics\u2019 influence means there\u2019s a sense in which its haunted suburban chilliness sounds old hat. But the production is smarter than that sound\u2019s schlockier Stranger Things reincarnation. You\u2019re No Good bears the sleek aerodynamism of Behaviour-era Pet Shop Boys, and the surfaces are corrupted: blown-out bass (Twist the Knife) and overdriven guitar (Touch Red) indicate the dread at the album\u2019s heart.\n\nIt\u2019s laced with the sound of ticking clocks, lyrics about time running out and repeating cycles of violence. While you could call that contemporary, adroit throwbacks suggest that existential peril has defined the last 50 years \u2013 the album opens with a cover of The Sound of Silence, and Move a Mountain reflects the earnest political optimism of Tapestry-era Carole King. It\u2019s here that Chromatics outsmart their imitators.", "description": "Smart production, corrupted sounds and existential dread set Kill for Love\u2019s successor apart from schlockier 80s pop reincarnations", "authors": ["Laura Snapes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d93549e2aeff4119f0a13d7340cfe8ded368916b/0_11_2564_1538/master/2564.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c4f1bb4061a1084e4823872fa3fa7ba8", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
