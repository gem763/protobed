If it can\u2019t take place on Sunday then we\u2019re really, really pressing the point that we need to have to get this game delayed 24 hours.\u201d\n\nDodson said that he had made little progress despite constant dialogue with tournament organisers, describing the concept of a further cancellation as \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d.\n\nHe added that the SRU had taken legal opinion that \u201cunravels the World Rugby case\u201d. Asked if it was too late to mount a legal challenge, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know that \u2013 we have to challenge it. Rugby supporters across the world are absolutely astounded at this rigidity from World Rugby.\n\n\u201cThe common sense approach to this is to play the game 24 hours later in perfect safety, where we can make sure that the pool stages are completed and the sporting integrity of the tournament remains intact.\u201d\n\nMany Scots fear that there is little chance of a change, believing that World Rugby are favouring the home nation as they desperately want a tier two team, and particularly the host nation, in the knockout phase.\n\nCROOKED FEED\n\nThey are also still stinging from the 2015 tournament when they were denied a place in the semi-finals by an incorrect last-minute penalty that handed Australia victory at Twickenham.\n\nLast week too there was general incredulity when Samoa were penalised for a crooked scrum feed in the last minute of the match against Japan - the only time a referee has punished the offence in the whole tournament.\n\nJapan were allowed to regain possession and went on to score the fourth try they needed for a bonus point that could prove decisive - at Scotland\u2019s expense - if Sunday\u2019s game goes ahead.\n\nAnd it is not just the Scots who raised an eyebrow at the Pool A schedule, which gives Japan a week between each of their matches while everyone else in the tournament has at least one short turnaround.\n\nMeanwhile, fans who bought tickets for the cancelled matches through official channels have already received emails saying refunds will be paid automatically to their account.\n\nRugby Union - Rugby World Cup 2019 - Pool A - Scotland v Russia - Shizuoka Stadium Ecopa, Shizuoka, Japan - October 9, 2019 Scotland's George Horne celebrates with team mates scoring their third try REUTERS/Annegret Hilse\n\nTickets bought from \u201cunauthorised secondary sources\u201d will not be refunded.\n\nIn addition to matches being called off, the typhoon\u2019s impact on transportation in Japan has also left fans frustrated.\n\nSome Australian supporters have had to miss their team\u2019s game against Georgia in Shizuoka on Friday because planned train cancellations meant they would not have been able to get back to Tokyo for their flights home.", "description": "Scottish Rugby Union chief Mark Dodson said he is ready to launch a legal challenge to prevent World Cup organisers cancelling his country's game against Japan on Sunday - a measure that would almost certainly eliminate the Scots.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439637608&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0TO", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
