He will run from the cop. Tom will run with Rob. They will not stop,' the one-page story reads.\n\nThe extract also contains grammatical errors including 'Rob's socks is wet.'\n\nParents were quick to vent their fury online after they saw their children's homework.\n\nSomehow, even though it was not part of the curriculum, first-graders at a Pennsylvania school were asked to do a homework assignment about two boys running from a cop (pictured above)\n\nDiscovery of the assignment set-off a firestorm on social media. Ladodie Whiters, in a Facebook post above, included a picture of the homework and questioned how children could be asked to read such a story\n\n'This is what they are teaching in our Elementary schools in Pittsburgh. Really run from cop[s],' wrote Ladodie Whiters on Facebook.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Public Schools responded on Twitter, to say that the worksheet was not a part of the district's curriculum or intervention programs.\n\n'While we continue to support teacher autonomy to supplement classroom materials to meet the needs of their students, we must ensure that all materials placed in front of our students are culturally responsive, validating and affirming their cultural and ethnic identities,' the district wrote.\n\nTeachers involved were not identified, but an investigation has been launched, the district said.\n\nThe Pittsburgh School District, noticing the uproar online, tweeted that the matter was being investigated\n\nThe school district have shielded the identities of teachers involved, saying it was because they were investigating a 'personnel matter'. Pictured above is the Linden PreK-5 school where the assignment was handed out\n\nA district spokeswoman was not immediately available when DailyMail.com reached out.\n\nSchool District Solicitor Ira Weiss said he was told that two teachers are involved, reports TribLive.com.\n\nHe confirmed the district is investigating, but could not provide further information. He said his office is not involved in the investigation.\n\nNina Esposito-Visgitis, president of the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers and a reading specialist, told TribLive that the exercise was a one page in a packet of homework given to students.\n\nShe said it was apparent that the teachers were schooling the kids in 'short O' words, meaning words with an 'O' in the middle.\n\nAmong those who responded, several said they were concerned the assignment would actually encourage kids to be fearful of law enforcement.\n\n'You think it's funny to teach our children at a 1st grade level to run from cops with the current climate in law enforcement?' one Facebook user shared, reports Today.\n\n'It is appalling and offensive.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'I pay taxes & live across the street-I want to know why our PPS teachers are teaching students to break the law-especially in 1st grade?'", "description": "The assignment given at the Linden PreK-5 school in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, asks students as young as six to read three times about how 'Tom and Rob' were fleeing a police officer", "authors": ["Ralph R.
