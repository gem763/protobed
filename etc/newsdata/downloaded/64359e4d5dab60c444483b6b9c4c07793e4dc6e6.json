The FBI also arrested Michael Hlady, an Alchemist associate.\n\nNerayoff and Hlady face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of the alleged scheme, described as \u201can old-fashioned shakedown\u201d by the United States Attorney Office\u2019s for the Eastern District of New York (part of the Department of Justice) and \u201can age-old extortion scheme \u2026 with a modern-day twist\u201d by the FBI.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s attorney, Avi Moskowitz, told CoinDesk that \u201ca civil dispute has been improperly distorted into a criminal matter. Mr. Neryaoff looks forward to the truth coming out and clearing his name.\u201d\n\nAccording to the government\u2019s complaint, Nerayoff\u2019s firm was tapped to advise an undisclosed, Seattle-based startup \u2014 dubbed \u201cCompany 1\u201d in court documents \u2013 in July 2017. Nerayoff began demanding larger than contractually agreed-upon ethereum payouts for his help with the company\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) that coming fall, the complaint says,\n\nPer the agreement, Nerayoff was entitled to 22.5 percent of all the cryptocurrency tokens sold during the ICO as well as 22.5 percent of all the funds raised by Company 1 \u201cregardless of the method and manner in which [the funds] are raised.\u201d\n\nBefore the ICO occurred, Nerayoff demanded higher compensation from Company 1 executives, identified as John and Jane Doe. Through an email sent to the company\u2019s executives, Nerayoff demanded 30,000 ETH if the pre-sale and crowd sale surpassed 60,000 ETH in addition to a large allotment of the Company 1\u2019s ICO token, the complaint says.\n\nIf not, Nerayoff promised to \u201csabotage the crowd sale, generate negative press for Company 1 and use his contacts with influential people to \u2018destroy\u2019 Company 1,\u201d the DOJ alleged.\n\nCompany 1 agreed to the payout despite not receiving additional compensating services, the complaint says.\n\n\u2018Operations guy\u2019\n\nThe ICO raised 55,677 ETH during the pre-sale of the token. A crowd sale the following two months raised an additional 20,000 ETH, totaling 75,677 ETH raised, worth about $32 million at the time. Of the 75,766 ETH raised, Nerayoff received 30,000.\n\nThe following March, Nerayoff demanded a 10,000 ETH \u201cloan\u201d from Company 1 worth $4.45 million at the time, the complaint says. Nerayoff also introduced Company 1 to Hlady, his \u201coperations guy.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents, \u201cNerayoff claimed Hlady was a former government agent who could carry firearms through airports. On separate occasions, Hlady told Jane Doe \u2026 that he had been shot at and had killed people, that he had \u2018taken down\u2019 a head of state, and that he had been a part of the Irish Republican Army, the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the FBI.\u201d\n\nThat same month, the two executives of Company 1 visited Nerayoff at his New York home. While there, Hlady and Nerayoff entered the guest room of Jane Doe, sleeping by herself. Turning on the light and pulling a chair up to her bed, Hlady and Nerayoff demanded the 10,000 ETH loan or they would \u201ccrush\u201d her company.\n\nNerayoff and Hlady continued to threaten Jane Doe through iMessages and personal threats thereafter, including telling her where her child attended school.\n\nJane Doe instructed a Company 1 employee to pay the 10,000 ETH loan to Nerayoff between March 28 and April 1, 2018. The loan was never repaid by Nerayoff, according to the U.S. attorney.\n\nRoles in ethereum, tZero\n\nNerayoff was on the board of advisors of tZERO, Overstock\u2019s security token trading platform, as of March 1, 2018, according to a securities filing. An Overstock press release from 2017 described him as \u201carchitect of the Ethereum ICO.\u201d\n\nSimilar language has been used to describe his involvement with the early ethereum team. For example, his bio on the TechStars accelerator\u2019s website states,\n\n\u201cSteven\u2019s innovative work as the legal architect of Ethereum\u2019s record setting token sale continues to be the basic structure used throughout the world today. Steven innovated the concept of \u2018utility,\u2019 specifically using the concept of \u2018gas\u2019 or \u2018fuel\u2019 for legal purposes.\u201d\n\nPeople who worked on ethereum during its early days told CoinDesk he was indeed involved, though those descriptions may be somewhat exaggerated.\n\nFor example, Nerayoff guaranteed payment on about $200,000 of legal bills for an opinion letter the team obtained from a law firm for the 2014 token sale, according to one source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nHe was also involved in the ideation of gas, but far from the driving force suggested by his bio, two people who worked on the early ethereum team said.\n\nA tZero spokesperson told CoinDesk that the company \u201chas no affiliation with Steven and his company, Alchemist. In the past, Alchemist was a paid advisor to tZERO for its [security token offering]. tZERO has since terminated the advisory relationship.\u201d\n\nNerayoff is also the co-founder of Casper Labs, according to a February 2019 blog post by the company, which is researching the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that the ethereum network is expected to shift to in the future. However, his name was missing from the company\u2019s team page as of Wednesday evening. A message to the startup was not immediately returned.\n\nNikhilesh De and Marc Hochstein contributed reporting\n\nDepartment of Justice image via Shutterstock", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shutterstock_68494633-e1466198894120.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
