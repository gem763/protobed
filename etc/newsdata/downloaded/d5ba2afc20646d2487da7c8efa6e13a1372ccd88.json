I\u2019d failed the drug test that I\u2019d taken before the quarterfinals.\u201d\n\nThe men told Theodore his sample showed elevated levels of the hormone hCG, which is found in women during pregnancy. Bodybuilders who take anabolic steroids, such as testosterone, will sometimes use hCG to prevent or reverse side effects caused by steroids, such as testicular shrinkage and infertility.\n\nFor Theodore, hCG turned out to be an indicator of testicular cancer.\n\nTheodore wrote that he had amazing support from his teammates after the diagnosis and surgery.\n\nHe will donate to early detection causes for every point he records this season and the Vegas Golden Knights Foundation will match that dollar for dollar.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vegas Golden Knights defenseman Shea Theodore says he underwent surgery for testicular cancer during the offseason and is expected to make a full recovery.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "W.G.
