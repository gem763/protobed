The 27-year-old forward sat out four league games as he pushed for a move back to Barcelona during the summer transfer window.\n\nPSG and Barcelona - which two years ago sold Neymar for a world record 222 million euros ($246 million) - could not reach an agreement over his transfer following lengthy talks, and Neymar is now starting his third season with the French champion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m counting on him,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary that he comes back.\u201d\n\nIt could be a tense atmosphere in some sections of the crowd at Parc des Princes on Saturday, however.\n\nNeymar\u2019s public desire to re-join his former club, along with an interview recounting how much he enjoyed playing in Barca\u2019s 6-1 humiliation of PSG in the Champions League in 2017, led to hostile chanting against him by PSG\u2019s ultras in a home game last month.\n\nOne banner held aloft during that game urged him to \u201cGet Lost\u201d.\n\nNeymar may also not relish facing Strasbourg again. When the teams met in the French Cup in January, he limped off injured in a physical contest.\n\nMeanwhile, new signing Mauro Icardi could make his debut after joining on a season\u2019s loan from Serie A side Inter Milan, after a difficult last season with the Italian team. The problems began in January in a contract dispute, and he was then stripped of the captaincy.\n\nTuchel said the Argentina striker lacks match fitness and is not likely to start the game.\n\n\u201cMaybe we can use him tomorrow,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure he can play 90 minutes or even 60 minutes.\u201d\n\nPSG forwards Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 are still recovering from minor leg-muscle injuries.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Neymar is set to make his Paris Saint-Germain return after being included in the squad for Saturday's French league game at home to Strasbourg.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/soccer_psg_neymar_returns_96670_c0-90-4597-2770_s1770x1032.jpg?4d1e3752671be5d9c949ad0d9f593548c29c56a3", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
