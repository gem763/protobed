The metric declined 9.4% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million units. The figure lags the analysts\u2019 expectations of a 1.320 million units, per a Reuters\u2019 poll. The decline was largely due to weak construction in the multi-family housing segment. However, single-family home construction grew for the fourth consecutive month. The housing starts data compares unfavorably with August\u2019s revised figure of 1.386 million units (the highest level since June 2007). On a year-over-year basis, housing starts rose 1.6% in September.\n\nBuilding permits, a construction pointer for the coming months, dropped 2.7% to an annual rate of 1.387 million units. It compares unfavorably with August\u2019s 1.425 million units (the highest level since May 2007) (read: Why Homebuilder ETFs Are Rising).\n\nThere was a 0.3% rise in single-family homebuilding, which makes up a large portion of the housing market, to a rate of 918,000 units in September. This marks the highest level since January 2019. Regionally, single-family housing starts declined in the Northeast, West, and Midwest, except South. Moreover, permits to construct single-family homes increased 0.8% to 882,000 units in September (the highest level since February 2018) (read: Bet on Top-Notch Sector ETFs & Stocks to Sparkle Q4).\n\nMeanwhile, housing starts for the multi-family housing segment declined 28.2% to a rate of 338,000 units in September. Moreover, there was an 8.2% decline in permits to build multi-family homes to a rate of 505,000 units in September.\n\nCurrent Housing Market Conditions\n\nThe Fed has cut interest rates for the second time at the FOMC meeting in September 2019. When interest rate drops, mortgage rates decline, making real estate or refinancing mortgages more affordable. This, in turn, leads to higher home sales. Per Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has declined more than 135 basis points to an average of 3.57%.\n\nHowever, builders continue to bear the brunt of rising development and construction costs apart from trade woes. They are still grappling with regulatory burdens, deficit of lots and lack of skilled labor. These hurdles are affecting supply, which in turn, is disturbing the reasonable pricing of homes.\n\nHomebuilder ETFs in Focus\n\nAgainst the backdrop, let\u2019s take a look at some homebuilder ETFs.\n\niShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (WA: ) \u2014 up 49.6% year to date\n\nThis fund provides exposure to U.S. companies that manufacture residential homes by tracking the Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index.
