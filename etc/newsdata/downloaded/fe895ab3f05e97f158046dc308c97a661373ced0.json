My issue is with the Communist Party of China and their policies to the extent that they are inconsistent with our own values.\n\n\"In a democracy like ours, we encourage freedom of speech, freedom of expression, thought etc.\n\n\"And if that is being impinged, if people are operating outside of the law, then whether they are from China or from any other country, we have a right to call that out.\"\n\nRegional influence push\n\nMr Dutton's criticism coincides with Prime Minister Scott Morrison travelling to Fiji for a bilateral visit as part of the government's Pacific Step Up policy, aimed in part as a check against Chinese efforts to build regional influence.\n\nMr Dutton's Home Affairs Department has a key role in administering the foreign interference laws, which were introduced amid concern over Chinese influence in politics.\n\nAlthough no one has publicly confirmed it, intelligence agencies suspect China was behind hacks on the computer system of Parliament House and the major political parties, as well as the Australian National University.\n\nThe Morrison government has established a taskforce to safeguard universities from foreign interference, amid concerns about Chinese academics collaborating on security related projects at Australian institutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther challenges to campus freedom have emerged. Pro-Beijing students won the praise of Brisbane Chinese Consul-General Xu Jie for their \"patriotic behaviour\" after clashing with students supporting democracy in Hong Kong at the University of Queensland in July.\n\nWhile the government is reluctant to criticise China too harshly in public, Mr Dutton said \"if we stick to the facts, we're on safe ground\".\n\n\"I think many within the government and the senior echelons of the public service and our intelligence community have been saying it for a long period of time,\" Mr Dutton said.\n\nWith the government often reluctant to criticise China too harshly, La Trobe Asia executive director Euan Graham said Mr Dutton's comments were a noticeable advance.\n\n\"Part of the problem in the dissonance in internal conversations you get in Canberra and what is said in public, is it allows gaps to develop between government and the business community.\" he said.", "description": "Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has slammed China's conduct as being at odds with Australian values, saying a 'frank conversation' was needed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3001%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0bb785e1dd371d8453206cd2c7a905df125e6f40", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
