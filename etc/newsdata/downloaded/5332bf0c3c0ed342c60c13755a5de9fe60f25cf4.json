Indigenous groups, students and unions joined the action, blocking roads with rocks and burning tires.\n\nIn Quito, riot police used tear gas and deployed armoured vehicles against masked protesters who threw stones.\n\n\"It's an indefinite action until the government overturns the decree on subsidies. We're paralysing the nation,\" said bus transport leader Abel Gomez.\n\nOfficials say the elimination of fuel subsidies was necessary to lift the economy and stop smuggling.\n\n190929200959712\n\nMoreno, who won the election in 2017 to replace Rafael Correa, told reporters the \"perverse\" subsidy, in place for 40 years, had distorted the economy and protests would not be allowed to paralyse Ecuador.\n\n\"To ensure citizens' security and avoid chaos, I have ordered a national state of emergency,\" the president said of the measure that suspends some rights and empowers the military to keep order. \"I have the courage to make the right decisions for the nation.\"\n\nArrests\n\nSome groups of protesters trying to reach the presidential palace in downtown Quito clashed with police. In Guayaquil, several shops were looted, authorities said.\n\nInterior Minister Maria Romo said 19 people were arrested for blocking roads and other crimes.\n\n\"The lack of transport affects us all, but equally the rise in gasoline prices will affect us,\" said Cesar Lopez, 39, walking to his business in Quito.\n\nWith a population of more than 17 million people, Ecuador has a long history of political instability.

Along with tax reforms, the government would benefit by about $2.27bn, he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ecuador announced it was leaving the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to pump more oil and raise revenues. Ecuador pumps 545,000 barrels per day.\n\n190826134509203\n\nState energy company Petroecuador said oil facilities were operating normally despite Thursday's unrest.\n\nThe government wants to reduce the fiscal deficit from an estimated $3.6bn this year to under one billion in 2020.\n\nEcuador's debt grew under Correa, who endorsed Moreno in the 2017 election but has since become a critic of his successor's turn towards more market-friendly economic policies.\n\nMoreno's government has improved relations with the United States and reached a $4.2bn deal with the IMF in February.\n\nBut scepticism of the IMF runs strong in Ecuador and throughout Latin America, where many blame austerity policies for economic hardship.\n\n\"We'll close all the main roads,\" said taxi driver Sergio Menoscal, 55, helping to block streets in Guayaquil.\n\n\"We're tired of false promises ... we can't be blind to a government that has done nothing for the people.\"", "description": "Protesters take to the streets over the end of decades-old fuel subsidies as part of government fiscal reform package.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/3/f1e8d8621f6d44c9adf5d471242472fe_18.jpg"}
