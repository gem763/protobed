I did yesterday to [sic],\" Lukaku wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"Football is a game to be enjoyed by everyone and we shouldn't accept any form of discrimination that will put our game in shame. I hope the football federations all over [the] world react strongly on all cases of discrimination.\"\n\nHe also argued that social media platforms should take a stronger stance against racial abuse and added that \"instead of going forward we're going backwards ... as players we need [to] unify and make a statement on this matter to keep this game clean and enjoyable for everyone.\"\n\nLukaku scored his second goal in as many games for Inter.\n\n'Identify, isolate and ban'\n\nInter boss Antonio Conte insists he did not hear the noises from his touchline position, but said in a news conference after the game that \"in Italy we must improve a lot and be more educated and respectful towards those doing their job.\"\n\n\"In other countries you support the team; you don't insult the opposition like this,\" Conte added. \"There must be the maximum respect. Today I was treated well and wasn't insulted, other times it hasn't happened like that and it's not nice.\"\n\nIn a statement, Cagliari called Sunday's incident \"absolutely unacceptable\" and affirmed the club's intention \"to identify, isolate and ban those ignorant individuals whose shameful actions and behaviors are completely against those values that Cagliari Calcio strongly promotes in all their initiatives.\n\nIt continued: \"Full solidarity to Romelu Lukaku and even stronger commitment toward[s] annihilating one of the worst plagues that affects football and our world in general.\n\n\"However, as we are aware that technology is not enough, we believe our commitment needs real support by the rest of the football stakeholders: starting from all the true supporters, to all the stewards in the stands, from police and security agents, passing to media and as well through Lega Serie A and FIGC [the Italian FA].\"\n\nCNN has reached out to Serie A and the Italian FA for comment, with Serie A confirming that a statement will be issued later on Monday.\n\nEarlier this year, Everton forward Moise Kean was racially abused by Cagliari fans while playing for Juventus.\n\nAt the time, teammate Leonardo Bonucci said Kean had to take \"50-50 of the blame\" for the abuse he was subjected to after lifting his arms aloft and looking to the stands.
