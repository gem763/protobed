Will he deliver this time?", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Fans looking for Kanye West's new album 'Jesus is King' will instead find the trailer for his upcoming IMAX film 'Jesus is King.' USA TODAY\n\nKanye West just teased a new release date for his \"Jesus is King\" album after missing scheduled release dates for the new music twice in the past month.\n\nIn a rare tweet \u2013 the rapper's first since Jan. 1 \u2013 West shared a new graphic of a blue record that reads \"Jesus is King\" and \"Kanye West.\" It also mentions \"new songs\" and \"LP,\" industry speak for a full album.\n\nThis is the third official release date for West's ninth album.\n\n\"Jesus is King\" was first expected to be released Sept. 27 at midnight. His wife, Kim Kardashian West, had been promoting a potential album release all week on Twitter, and, at the time, West's website still featured what appeared to be a \"Jesus is King\" setlist with Sept. 27 as the release date.\n\nBut midnight came and went, and no new music became available to fans. Kardashian West turned to her Instagram Story late that day with a new date: \"He's dropping the album Sunday,\" she wrote. \"Just a few final tweaks to the mixes.\"\n\nWest pulled a similar stunt last year, teasing the release of a project titled \"Yandhi\" for Black Friday 2018 before failing to drop an album that day and announcing several months later that it had been delayed indefinitely.\n\nAlso purportedly dropping on Friday: the accompanying \"Jesus is King\" film.\n\nWest dropped a vague trailer Oct. 17 for his upcoming film directed by British filmmaker Nick Knight. The movie, which will feature gospel performances from his Sunday Service Choir, is set to debut in IMAX theaters worldwide Oct. 25.\n\nIn the cryptic trailer, the screen slowly zooms in on a light at the end of a keyhole tunnel as his gospel music plays in the background. The image then cuts to a Bible verse from Mark 1:15 that reads, \"In the words of Jesus Christ, 'The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe in the gospel.'\"\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson, USA TODAY.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/21/kanye-west-teases-new-jesus-king-album-release-date-week/4050861002/", "description": "Kanye West teased a new release date for his \"Jesus is King\" album after missing scheduled release dates for the new music twice in the past month.", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Published A.M.
