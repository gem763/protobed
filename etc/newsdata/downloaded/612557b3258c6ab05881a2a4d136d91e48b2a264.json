He is getting his body right and it is paying dividends.\u201d\n\nTuilagi\u2019s tries showed two very different sides to his game.\n\nThe first a display of brute strength, the 28-year-old shipped the ball off the back of a five-metre scrum and rumbled across the line despite several defenders trying to drag him to the ground.\n\nTuilagi\u2019s second try was all about pace and timing, haring through the channel to offer flying winger Jonny May the inside option and racing through untouched to score.\n\nEngland scrumhalf Ben Youngs, Tuilagi\u2019s Leicester team mate, said the big centre was in \u201cdevastating\u201d form.\n\n\u201cHe is a physical force you have to try and stop and I am very pleased he is on our team,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s eight years since his last World Cup try and it is crazy, and that is why he is enjoying it so much. He is one of the best players in the world and makes people want to come and watch at the stadium or on TV and he did that magnificently today.\u201d", "description": "After waiting eight years to return to rugby's biggest stage it was no surprise Manu Tuilagi grabbed his opportunity with both hands on Sunday with a brace of tries helping England to a 35-3 victory over Tonga at the Sapporo Dome.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432790159&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M015", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
