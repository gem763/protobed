Josue Valdez Sarmiento, sprints in and abruptly knocks the grappling duo to the ground.\n\nThe video was first posted by 209 Times and has more than 1.2 million views on Facebook.\n\nThe Marine then held the students briefly down on the ground before getting up. One of the students is picked up by an adult and the other is seen lying on the ground after being tackled.\n\nIn a statement to KCRA-TV, the school district said it was aware of the incident and is investigating the situation.\n\n\u201cStockton Unified is aware of the student matter that took place on 9/11/19 [Wednesday] at Edison High School and the recording circulating on social media. We are actively investigating the situation,\u201d the district said.\n\nDRUNK MARINE BREAKS INTO FLORIDA HOME, TELLS OWNER TO 'GO BACK TO SLEEP,' COPS SAY\n\nValdez Sarmiento is a recent graduate of the school and was there to help with recruiting but is not a recruiter, the U.S. Marine Corps said.\n\n\u201cHe saw a dangerous fight break out. Upon observing that situation, he moved over and broke up the fight,\" Maj. Thomas Driscoll told KCRA. \"Although, the manner in which he did [could] have been improved, we are proud of Pfc. Valdez Sarmiento for his decision to intervene.\"\n\nValdez Sarmiento has received counseling and been reassigned to office duties, according to the Corps.\n\nThe 209 Times said the students had been fighting for \u201cover a minute uninterrupted in the open.\u201d\n\n\u201c[\u2026 What] we are posting that parents may find concerning is a Marine recruiter blindside tackling a student so hard to break up the fight that if appears he hurts the student and does more damage than the actual fight itself. He ran full-speed from over 30 yards out,\u201d they said. \u201cAlso of concern is the lack of response from actual school staff, as the fight lasted for over a minute uninterrupted in the open.\u201d\n\nCAUGHT ON CAMERA: WOMAN STEALS WALLET FROM ELDERLY VICTIM'S PURSE IN CALIFORNIA SUPERMARKET, POLICE SAY\n\nPeople had mixed reactions to how Valdez Sarmiento broke up the fight.\n\n\u201cIt was just too excessive ... how he came toward the kids,\u201d student Johnny Hempill told KCRA. \u201cI feel like going at a kid, especially when he\u2019s not looking, makes more of an impact.\u201d\n\nBut a parent told Fox40 Sacramento the action was justified.\n\n\u201cIt could have been a little less of a tackle, but I believe in discipline. These kids were not behaving. Someone's got to stop it,\u201d the parent said.\n\nMany social media users backed up the Marine's actions.\n\n\"That was a soft tackle to stop a fight using non-lethal force. Crybaby parents need to learn to teach his or her child better,\" Twitter user Rudolph Hernandez wrote, while another user said the tackle \"looked pretty effective.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, user Scott Baerst said, \"That was dumb and dangerous. Hope that kid's back/neck is OK.\"\n\nThe condition of the students has not been released, according to reports.\n\nThe school and Stockton Police Department are investigating the incident.", "description": "A Marine\u00a0was caught on camera this week blindside\u00a0tackling two California\u00a0high school students who were fighting.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Impact.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
