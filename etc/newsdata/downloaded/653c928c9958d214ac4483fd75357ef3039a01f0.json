But even by his standards, this was quite a weekend.\n\nTrump was asked Sunday about the trip to Poland he canceled to monitor Hurricane Dorian. Asked if he had a message for that country, which was commemorating the anniversary of the start of World War II, Trump decided to \u2026 congratulate it?\n\nQ: Mr. President, do you have a message for Poland on the 80th anniversary of the Second World War? TRUMP: I do have a great message for Poland. And we have Mike Pence, our Vice President, is just about landing right now. And he is representing me. I look forward to being there soon. But I just want to congratulate Poland. It\u2019s a great country with great people. We also have many Polish people in our country; it could be 8 million. We love our Polish friends. And I will be there soon.\n\nFor those not versed in World War II history, Sunday was the anniversary of the day Nazi Germany invaded Poland, which led France and Great Britain to declare war two days later (i.e. 80 years ago Tuesday). Poland would wind up losing nearly one-fifth of its population in the war, according to estimates.\n\nAs such, it was more of a day for somber remembrance than a day of triumph. The German president asked for Poland\u2019s forgiveness, for instance. And Trump\u2019s comment struck a significantly different tone than the man sent to Poland in his stead, Vice President Pence.\n\n[A Trump-inspired history lesson: Here\u2019s what the Nazis did to Poland 80 years ago]\n\n\u201cIt is difficult for any of us who are not Poles to fathom the horrors that began here 80 years ago, on this day, the first of September 1939,\u201d Pence said solemnly, as The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa reported.\n\nTrump was also asked to weigh in on another issue of import in our own hemisphere this weekend: The situation in Colombia, where some of the former leaders of the guerrilla group known as FARC announced a break in a 2016 peace deal, potentially relaunching Latin America\u2019s longest war.\n\nWhen asked about this, Trump at first didn\u2019t seem to connect the Marxist FARC to Colombia. He then offered what can only be described as his own trademarked brand of boilerplate:\n\nQ: On Colombia, how do you feel about former FARC leader calling to return -- for return to war? TRUMP: Colombia, you said? Q: Yeah, on Colombia. Former leader of FARC. TRUMP: You\u2019re talking about the country of Colombia? Q: Yeah, the country of Colombia. The -- TRUMP: Yeah. No, we have a great relationship. And they\u2019re not doing badly. They have a problem because of the Venezuela. A lot of people are pouring in. But Colombia -- we\u2019ve had a great relationship with Colombia.\n\nThe video in which the former FARC leaders announced the break in the peace deal was posted early Thursday. These comments from Trump came Friday around 6 p.m., meaning he had about a day and a half to be briefed in the situation. It appears either that he didn\u2019t get a briefing or that he didn\u2019t really retain any of the information.\n\nWhich is pretty much par-for-the-course for Trump. There are myriad examples of Trump being asked about what\u2019s happening around the world and offering very nonspecific answers. Generally, this will involve 1) congratulating them, 2) talking about how well they are doing, and/or 3) offering a nonspecific talking point about something that has happened in the country (which may or may not pertain to the subject he was asked about, as was the case here with Colombia).\n\nAnd in fact, he\u2019s done the same thing with FARC before. When Trump welcomed then-Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos to the White House in 2017, he offered congratulations on the peace deal in very broad terms, calling the war with FARC \u201ca long, tough situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, FARC is \u2014 that was a long, tough situation, as you know very well, coming from the country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I think the president has done a magnificent job. Not easy. But he\u2019s done a magnificent job.\u201d\n\nWhile appearing at the United Nations in 2018 with Colombia\u2019s new president, Iv\u00e1n Duque, Trump was asked about FARC and ELN, the National Liberation Army, the country\u2019s most violent rebel group. Trump offered another broad answer before the Colombian president stepped in to field the question:\n\nQ: Are you going to talk about FARC and ELN, the peace process? TRUMP: Are you asking me that question? We\u2019re going to be talking about everything. DUQUE: But let me \u2014 TRUMP: We\u2019ll be talking about everything. DUQUE: Mr. President, if I may take that. TRUMP: Go ahead. DUQUE: And this a very important message: ELN is a terrorist group that has been killing Colombian people. They have been introducing kidnappings in the last 17 months while they were negotiating with the past administration. And I have said they have to put an end to all their criminal activities and they have to free all the persons that are kidnapped. Otherwise, there will be no chance for any negotiation with them.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t met with just Santos and Duque. He also secretly met in 2017 with two former Colombian presidents at Mar-a-Lago \u2014 two presidents who happen to be prominent critics of the peace deal Santos struck with FARC -- meaning he\u2019s had multiple opportunities to learn about the FARC \u201csituation.\u201d To date, he hasn\u2019t said anything specific about it.", "description": "Even for a president known for saying some odds things about foreign countries, the long weekend was remarkable.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GBFSABafVZSP8UlKLihYjdKiyic=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LLY5PEGLPMI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg"}
