We value and celebrate the differences of our people and do not advocate conformity among our people,\" the spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are incredibly proud of our women and our longstanding commitment to diversity, inclusion and creating a culture of belonging for all.\"", "description": "Big Four accounting firm said an executive training course with \"offensive\" content \"should not have been offered\"", "authors": ["Megan Cerullo"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/22/07d7d643-a5f7-4370-9001-f8b387930f7c/thumbnail/1200x630/64d828dd9d99d57d7f68f3e1844d075a/gettyimages-626256908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
