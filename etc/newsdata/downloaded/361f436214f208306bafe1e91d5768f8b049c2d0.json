She maintains she was a victim of sex trafficking and shot Allen, a stranger, in self-defense when she thought he was reaching for a gun. She then took two of his guns and some money from his wallet and drove away in his truck.\n\nA jury rejected Brown-Long\u2019s argument of self-defense and convicted her on charges of murder and aggravated robbery. She was sentenced in 2006 to life in prison and would not have been eligible for parole until she was in her late 60s.\n\nThen-Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam (R) in January changed the course of Brown-Long\u2019s life by commuting her sentence. She will be on supervised parole for 10 years.\n\nAD\n\nWhile in prison, Brown-Long earned an associate degree and bachelor\u2019s degree at Lipscomb University in Nashville. She started writing the memoir that was released Tuesday, \u201cFree Cyntoia: My Search for Redemption in the American Prison System.\u201d Celebrities including Rihanna and Kim Kardashian advocated for her release.\n\nAD\n\nBrown-Long has said she had run away from her adoptive parents\u2019 home in the months before she killed Allen, a 43-year-old real estate agent who picked her up at a Sonic Drive-In in Nashville and asked her for sex. According to Brown-Long she had been forced into prostitution by an abusive boyfriend nicknamed \u201cCut Throat\u201d who sexually assaulted her.\n\nBrown-Long did not think of herself as a victim at the time, she told news anchor Lester Holt on Monday on \u201cNBC Nightly News.\u201d She said she was beaten down after being raped by several men and saw \u201cCut Throat\u201d as the Clyde to her Bonnie.\n\nAD\n\nShe said she expected men at that time to behave violently toward her and always was ready to defend herself. That realization, Brown-Long said, makes her unsure whether she correctly interpreted Allen\u2019s actions as a threat on the night she killed him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd, you know, there\u2019s times I wonder, like, was I really, like, in real life in danger?\u201d she told \u201cNBC Nightly News.\u201d \u201cOr was that just in my head?\u201d\n\nPrison was an opportunity for rehabilitation, but the environment made it difficult, Brown-Long said on \u201cToday.\u201d Writing down her experiences brought her back to difficult moments and reminded her that she had not fully healed from them, she said. Brown-Long said she also found faith and realized \u201cGod doesn\u2019t work on my time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAlthough I had said, \u2018I want to do the right thing, I want to stay on this path\u2019 \u2026 there were several bumps along the way,\u201d Brown-Long said. \u201cAnd so I really had to find it in myself that I wanted to change.\u201d\n\nAfter facing so many years of public scrutiny, Brown-Long said she wants people to know she is more than the worst thing she has ever done. There are many women in prison who have similar stories to hers and deserve compassion, Brown-Long said on \u201cNBC Nightly News.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe women who helped me get to this point, they\u2019re still in prison for 51 years and up with ridiculous sentences, and they don\u2019t have hope right now,\u201d Brown-Long said. \u201cThe system strips them of any personhood, of any voice. And I feel like in seeing me you\u2019re able to see them, because they\u2019re just like me.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Brown-Long, who served 15 years for killing a man who had taken her to his home, gave her first television interviews since her release.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rWiw_WftHjuZvT1QPkIwCwQXMAI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CBJCCBHPIMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
