Kevon Looney has a hamstring strain, and he'll miss the preseason opener Saturday night against the Lakers. Free-agent signee Willie Cauley-Stein will miss all of training camp and is out until late October with a foot strain. Then there's second-round draft pick Alen Smailagic, who will be out for the \"foreseeable future\" with an ankle sprain.\n\nWith little in the way of big men depth -- healthy, that is -- the Warriors reportedly brought in a former lottery pick for a workout Friday.

He owns career averages of 2.2 points, 2.7 rebounds and 0.8 blocks per game, and most recently played in the NBA with the Oklahoma City Thunder back in 2013-14.\n\nWhile he's been out of the league for a few seasons, Thabeet apparently has been staying active hoping for another chance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThabeet spent the last year transforming his body pic.twitter.com/f5vRFaf46e \u2014 Ben Stinar (@BenStinar) October 5, 2019\n\nThere's a reason why Thabeet fell out of favor in the NBA, as his offensive limitations outweighed his defensive contributions. Still, similarly, there's a reason he was the No. 2 overall pick.\n\n[RELATED: Draymond intent on rediscovering 3-ball for new-look Dubs]\n\nAt the very least, Thabeet offers intriguing potential and above-average rim protection at the center spot. Beggars can't be choosers, and right now, he might be the Warriors' best available option.\n\nNBA rumors: Warriors work out former NBA lottery pick Hasheem Thabeet originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "With so many big men injured, the Warriors reportedly are looking for reinforcements.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/J3sqsmVD3vLN2A6muAZPrQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mieY6629bTX.L.ZXJk8Sg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/7dfb301c8d0bf17274b48b4f00982642", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
