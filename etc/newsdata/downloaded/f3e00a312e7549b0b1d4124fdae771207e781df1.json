Two years into a potential 15 year sentence, his lawyers will claim she called him a \u201closer\u201d, which provoked the attack.\n\nMrs Matthew\u2019s family criticised the proceedings, describing Dubai's legal system as \u201cbiased\u201d and saying the defence was trying to \u201cblame Jane for her own death\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Dubai system is truly biased against Jane,\u201d said Peter Manning, brother of Mrs Matthew.\n\nIn a letter seen by The Telegraph and sent to Dubai\u2019s Court of Cassation, the emirate\u2019s highest judicial body, Mr Manning said releasing Mr Matthew early would deny his sister justice.\n\nFrancis was editor-at-large of Gulf News when he killed his wife, Jane, following an argument Credit: Telegraph More\n\n\u201cTo excuse this crime in some way as being Jane\u2019s fault sends a clear message to husbands across the United Arab Emirates: you can kill your wife, even with a hammer, and all you have to do to escape justice is claim she \u2018demeaned you\u2019,\u201d wrote Mr Manning. \u201cThis denies Jane her human right to life.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is very dangerous and completely opposite to the UAE\u2019s aim of being a modern, gender equal nation.\u201d\n\nMr Matthew, a former Economist journalist and editor of Gulf News, hit his wife with a hammer in the early hours of the morning in June 2017 following an argument.\n\nMr Matthew's original conviction of assault that led to death in March 2018 was upgraded to murder on appeal and he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Court of Cassation overturned the conviction and a panel of judges will review the case this week.\n\nHis defence will argue that he is guilty of \u201cphysical assault that led to death\u201d. If the court agrees, he could walk free with time served.\n\nFrancis is appealing for a lighter conviction, arguing that Jane provoked him by calling him a 'loser' Credit: Telegraph More\n\nMrs Matthew's family said her husband picked up a hammer in his kitchen and walked to the bedroom, where Mrs Matthew was lying in bed before attacking her with intent. After killing her, he showered and went to work as editor before staging a break-in on his return that evening.\n\n\u201cAs Jane\u2019s brother I am in no doubt that this was pre-meditated murder and I confirm that I wish to see Mr Matthew convicted of pre-meditated murder and jailed appropriately,\u201d said Mr Manning. \u201cMy father and I have been frustrated with the way the Court of First Instance allowed the defence to blame Jane for her own death.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear what impact the letter will have and Dubai is yet to acknowledge it.\u201cIf the court was open to justice they should be less willing to erect barriers to my letter,\u201d said Mr Manning.\n\nThe Foreign Office said it is supporting Mrs Matthew\u2019s family and is in touch with the relevant local authorities.", "description": "The family of a murdered British woman has said Dubai will set a \"dangerous\" precedent if it releases her husband from prison this week, two years after he bludgeoned her to death with a hammer.\u00a0 Francis Matthew, 62, will fight his murder conviction on Wednesday on the grounds that his wife", "authors": ["Cara Mcgoogan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_KxzEmSU70SreqvH4VEAbQ--~B/aD00Njk7dz03NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/00d998ff1de51092a70c4d7a4e5f5355"}
