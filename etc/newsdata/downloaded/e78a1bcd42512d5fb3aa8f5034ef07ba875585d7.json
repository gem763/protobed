Turkish-backed Arab fighters have also killed several Kurdish captives as well as Hervin Khalaf, the head of a Kurdish political party.\n\nForeign policy experts, including Brett McGurk, a former U.S. envoy to the global anti-ISIS coalition who resigned last year in protest of Trump, have warned that Trump\u2019s decision not to defend the Kurds is highly immoral and threatens national security.\n\nMattis, during his interview with NBC, warned that ISIS will \u201cabsolutely\u201d reemerge if the U.S. doesn\u2019t keep the pressure on in Syria.", "description": "The former defense secretary warned that national security is \"tied inextricably to our alliances,\" following Trump's decision to abandon the Syrian Kurds.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da35ca3210000150c344aa3.png?cache=5vij3jyi1j&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
