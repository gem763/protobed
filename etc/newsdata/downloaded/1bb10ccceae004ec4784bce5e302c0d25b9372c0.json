He\u2019s no longer playing for the league.\n\nBut the NBA had leaned into letting players and employees speak their mind. Then China came along.\n\nA tweet by a Houston Rockets executive expressing solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters has led to uproar in China, where the league has deep, deep business ties, and challenged the league\u2019s apparent wokeness. A web of organizations suspended their affiliations with the NBA (adding to the entanglement: The Chinese Basketball Association is run by Yao Ming, a former Houston Rockets star).\n\nThe NBA has tried to have it both ways, trying to placate China while also saying it supports free speech. My colleague Jemele Hill has a scathing argument about the NBA\u2019s positioning: \u201cIf the NBA buckles to China, that merely shows that the league will fight for its values only if no real sacrifice is involved.\u201d\n\nThe NBA is just the latest to bend under China\u2019s economic might. Companies from Mercedes Benz to Marriott have made gestures towards supporting humans rights and free speech, but any such concerns fall by the wayside when they run into the prospect of being shut out of China\u2014billions of upwardly mobile consumers and $14 trillion GDP are on the opposing team.\n\n\u2014 Saahil Desai\n\nWhat Else We\u2019re Watching\n\nOn impeachment, should Democrats hang together? Some pundits say Democrats in swing districts might be safer if they break with their party should an impeachment vote come to the House floor. But recent electoral results don\u2019t back that up, Ronald Brownstein writes.\n\n+ What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? Impeachment chicken. Given President Trump\u2019s apparent refusal to cooperate with Congress\u2019 impeachment inquiry, these are the options that House Democrats, the courts, and the president each have.\n\nA GOP contradiction: How can some Republicans denounce the administration\u2019s latest strategy pivot in Syria as a betrayal, while still supporting the president? \u201cYet, in all likelihood, Graham, Cheney, Rubio, and McConnell will support Trump for the 2020 GOP nomination,\u201d Conor Friedersdorf argues, \u201cdoing nothing to find a superior standard-bearer.\u201d\n\nOur Reporters Are Also Reading\n\n\u2023 Two Days in the Life of Nancy Pelosi, Political Grandmaster (Abigail Tracy, Vanity Fair) (Paywall)\n\n\u2023 Lindsey Graham dishes on Trump in hoax calls with Russians (Natasha Bertrand, Politico)\n\nAbout us: The Atlantic\u2019s politics newsletter is a daily effort from our politics desk.
