We go with them to the doctor\u2019s appointments and, if the needs arise, to the hospital. If they need to go to school, we help them with that as well. Then, we help them to find a job, with the integration in the labour market, in school and in professional training.\"\n\nRefugee Fawzi Rasheed works in the foundation and says, \u201cThis Foundation has received dozens of migrants, since 2015.
