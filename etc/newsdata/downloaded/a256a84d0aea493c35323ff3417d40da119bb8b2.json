While the Chinese smartphone market still contracted by 3% in the third quarter compared to a year earlier, Huawei smartphones made up 41.5 million of the 97.8 million shipped in the period, giving it a 42% market share, according to data from market research firm Canalys.

The third quarter sales also mark Apple's weakest quarter in China for five years, Nicole Peng, Canalys vice president of mobility told Reuters.\n\nHuawei boosts China smartphone market share to 42% in third quarter: Canalys", "description": "Huawei boosts China smartphone market share to 42% in third quarter: Canalys", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9T055-OCATC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
