The University of California, which supplies around 10 per cent of academic research in US, chose not to renew its subscription in a move to support a lower-cost alternate model where payment is made by the author rather than the user. This considerably increased the risk of other universities following suit.\n\nAre your US companies reporting difficulties hiring workers?\n\nOur investment process seeks companies with culture that fosters high employee retention and long tenured employment. As a result, most of our companies have low voluntary employee attrition rates. One of our holdings, Accenture, an IT outsourcing company, has been thoughtfully retraining its employees that are at risk of losing their job to automation. I find this talent reallocation efficient, especially in the present times.\n\nHow cheap would the FAANGs have to be for you to buy in?\n\nThere is a popular notion that investors who don\u2019t hold FAANGs [Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google] run the risk of forfeiting substantial returns. In the year to June 2019, Aoris portfolio returned 22.3 per cent with no FAANGs. While we have nothing against FAANGs, we are happy not to own them as we believe the risks for these businesses are rising \u2013 not just regulatory but also saturated core markets, heightened competition, and capital risk from investing large sums into new areas where level of competence is lower.\n\nThe businesses I like are ones where change happens slowly. Aoris portfolio holds four IT companies \u2013 CDW, Amphenol, Accenture, and Jack Henry. These companies haven\u2019t created or disrupted industries, but they are leaders in their markets and have successfully grown earnings over many years, with a strong potential to keep delivering ahead.\n\nWe're always looking for new TV to stream. Anything new or old caught your eye?\n\nRecently I have been hooked on Peaky Blinders after hearing my colleagues get excited about the new season that just released. The show is very rowdy and lawless, but something about it is very captivating!\n\nFinally, a recommendation for a good value quick bite in Sydney?\n\nFor a good value quick bite, I\u2019d suggest Sabbaba (Middle Eastern street food) or the clean-food (no-nasties) burger chain Lord of the Fries.", "description": "AFR Markets Live chats to Aoris's Swati Reddy about Nike, liking businesses that don't disrupt and why she doesn't own the FAANGs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2853%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_667%2C$y_113/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f2be27768b5f4c72a87b22b3e2bea81c5ef38a47", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
