It has already raised prices on some of its products to cushion the blow from tariffs that went into effect in September.\n\nDespite tough market conditions, the company is investing in launch of new games, buying smaller firms and striking deals with production houses to boost sales of its toys.\n\nAs part of the strategy, Hasbro said in August it would buy Entertainment One for about $4 billion, adding popular brands such as Peppa Pig and PJ Masks.\n\nHasbro posted smaller-than-expected revenue of $1.58 billion and earned $1.84 per share excluding items in the third quarter, well below expectation of $2.21, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nShares of the company hit an intraday low of $98.85 and were set for their worst day since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Praveen Paramasivam in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Anil D'Silva)", "description": "The protracted trade war between the world's two largest economies has been weighing on many U.S. companies that have exposure to China and they have responded by taking various steps ranging from price hikes to shifting production to other countries.
