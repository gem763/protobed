Chinese IPOs alone halved in volume to $26.7 billion.\n\nBut with Belgian brewing giant AB Inbev reviving the Hong Kong listing of its Asian Budweiser Brewing Company APAC to raise around $5 billion last week, the mood has turned a little more upbeat.\n\n\"The markets may be a little more volatile, but that doesn't change the appetite for companies operating on strong fundamentals in China that are considering IPOs,\" said Alex Abagian, Co-Head of Asia Pacific ECM at Morgan Stanley.\n\n\"These are good assets, though maybe they will have to be a little more sensitive about price and valuation considering the extra market volatility,\" he said.\n\nSimilarly in Europe, bankers said they were feeling a little better about life after German tech firm TeamViewer and Swedish buyout group EQT Partners raised an overall 3.4 billion euros ($3.71 billion).\n\n\"I feel constructive about the rest of the year. We have already had some names re-open the market post-summer and there is a functioning market for growth stories of size,\" said James Fleming, co-head of ECM for Europe, Middle and Africa at Citi.\n\n\"That said, there's no denying it has been a tough year for EMEA ECM, with volumes at historically trough levels.\"\n\nEuropean ECM proceeds are at their lowest level since 2012 in the first three quarters of the year, down 23% to $88.6 billion equivalent, while IPO volumes are down a whopping 40% to around $17 billion.\n\nHopes that Saudi Aramco could blow this figure out of the water in the fourth quarter with the biggest deal of the year -- and possibly the biggest IPO ever -- have faded with sources telling Reuters the listing may not happen this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE ROBUST U.S. MARKET\n\nWhile ECM bankers in the Asia-Pacific and EMEA region have had a relatively lean time so far this year, their counterparts in the Americas have fared better, with overall volumes down only 6% at $203.77 billion.\n\nIn terms of IPOs, volumes in the United States were actually up 5% in the first three quarters of the year at $41.66 billion compared with the same period last year, helped by Uber's $8.1 May listing, the year's biggest IPO.\n\nBut there have also been some problems.\n\nUnicorns making their debut on the U.S. stock market are getting a rough ride, especially if they are losing money, casting a shadow over the IPO calendar for the rest of the year.\n\nLoss-making teeth alignment company SmileDirectClub was the first U.S. IPO in three years to price above its target range and close down on its first day, according to research firm Renaissance Capital.\n\nIt was a similar story for fitness startup Peloton Interactive Inc, which closed down 11.2% percent in their market debut having priced at the top of its target range.\n\n(For interactive version of this chart, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2n6GFme)\n\n\n\n\n\n($1 = 0.9155 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan, Additional reporting by Julie Zhu in Hong Kong and Joshua Franklin in New York; editing by Jane Merriman)", "description": "A couple of hefty share listings in Europe and the return of AB InBev's Asian unit float in the third quarter of 2019 brought some hope to a global IPO market battered by political volatility and downbeat global growth expectations.
