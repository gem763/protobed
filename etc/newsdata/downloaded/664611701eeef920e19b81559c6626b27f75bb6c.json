Hugely misunderstood by several publications as a meme (?), 'Hot Girl Summer' is basically a lifestyle, a commitment to living life to the fullest and being perpetually on your bullshit. Sure, those three words quickly became the catchphrase of summer 2019, but as Megan herself told us all, the gist is, \u201cbeing unapologetically you, having fun, being confident, living your truth.\u201d Simple.\n\nAs we move into September, summer may be ending but the Hot Girls will live on \u2013 Megan herself recently declared the start of the Hot Girl Semester. In celebration of a whole new season of living your best life, we asked the people of London to share the most Hot Girl Summer thing they did this year.\n\nSARA\n\nVICE: What\u2019s the most Hot Girl Summer thing you\u2019ve done?\n\nSara: A guy tried to bully me on the train and I told him to fuck off.\n\nDid you feel like you were having a Hot Girl Summer after that?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhere were you going?\n\nIt was the Central Line I was heading to Oxford Circus.\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nHe said, \u201cYou should be lucky because you\u2019re a woman, otherwise I would have slapped you.\u201d He was having a bad day, I guess and I must have moved in front of him or something.\n\nIt\u2019s not much better than threatening to slap you. Were you with anyone?\n\nI was with my husband, who tried to calm me down. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, calm down,\u201d but I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t care. You don\u2019t speak to a woman like that.\u201d It feels good to let them know instead of just shutting up. Always.\n\nNELE\n\nVICE: What\u2019s the most Hot Girl Summer thing you\u2019ve done?\n\nNele: Um, oh my goodness. What have I done this summer? That\u2019s the question. I was hiking in Italy and it was so hot that I just walked around in my bra.\n\nVibey. Is that something you might normally do?\n\nNot really, I was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m in the mountains, I can just do it.\" But the next second, we were in a village full of old people and there I was in my bra. I mean, they\u2019re probably used to it and thought it\u2019s just crazy tourists taking off their clothes. I might have had some strange looks \u2013 I have no idea how much happens in that village. It might have been the highlight of the week.\n\nWere you with anyone?\n\nI was with my brother. He took off his shirt but I think it\u2019s much more common for guys to do it. I just took it off because of equality, and you don\u2019t want to pass out in the heat. There was no shade on the hike for about three hours.\n\nJUAN\n\nVICE: Hi Juan. Have you heard the term \u2018Hot Girl Summer\u2019?\n\nJuan: No.\n\nYou could say it\u2019s doing something fun for yourself.\n\nBack in Spain, there was a party in an attic in a house and I joined them. It was amazing.\n\nOkay\u2026 I mean, that's not the sam\u2013 never mind. Were the people in the attic your friends?\n\nNo, no, no. I didn\u2019t know them, I walking on the street, they called from the window asking for ice, so I bought ice from a shop, took it up and joined them. It was amazing.\n\nIs that something you reckon might often happen in Spain?\n\nWell, yeah but it depends on you as well. When I started living on Brick Lane, I started doing it. I called people to bring ice to my own party after that. I was living there, just over the bagel shop. I partied with young people, old people. You don\u2019t have to be a stereotype to have a good time.\n\nJANET AND BELLA\n\nJanet (left) and Bella.\n\nVICE: Hi you two, what\u2019s the most Hot Girl Summer thing you\u2019ve done?\n\nBella: It\u2019s about looking good, right?\n\nIt could be. It's more about treating yourself well, loving who you are but not being faux-spiritual or pretentious about it.\n\nI started going to the gym, I just wanted to look better because I normally don\u2019t care. Also, I took off my entire swimming costume. I was in Luxembourg with my friend and it was a really small place. I saw these two elderly women take off their top and I thought, \u201cI want to do that. I like that. I\u2019m not embarrassed anymore.\u201d It was really liberating.\n\nDo you think you\u2019ll do it again?\n\nBella: I hope so, maybe not in a really crowded place.\n\nJanet: I used to do that all the time, and she was like, \u201cOh mum, don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHa, thank you both.\n\n\n\nJACK\n\nVICE: What\u2019s the most Hot Girl Summer thing you\u2019ve done?\n\nJack: I don\u2019t do anything Hot Girl Summer. I just spent \u00a38 on an Aperol Spritz. That\u2019s like a really stupid hot girl thing to do.\n\nWhen did you do that?\n\nLiterally just now, it was an 11AM \u00a38 cocktail, there you go.\n\nAre you OK? More importantly, did it taste worth it?\n\nNo, it was very underwhelming.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a trendy thing to drink.\n\nExactly. Yeah, it is. I didn\u2019t Boomerang it on Instagram though. I think I\u2019m misunderstanding what a Hot Girl Summer is. Is it a basic bitch thing?\n\nQuite the opposite \u2013 It\u2019s a Megan Thee Stallion thing.\n\nOh.\n\nGEMMA\n\nVICE: What\u2019s the most Hot Girl Summer thing you\u2019ve done?\n\nGemma: Probably buying a dog. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have time, but I\u2019ve made time for him and he\u2019s a cool little character.\n\nWhat made you make the decision?\n\nI wanted one so I thought, \"I\u2019ll look at dogs but I won\u2019t buy one, I\u2019ll be sensible about it.\" But when someone puts a puppy in your hands, you can\u2019t really say no, can you? So next thing, I was riding home on the tube with this little tiny puppy in my hands thinking, \"Fuck.\" But it worked out well in the end.\n\nWhat\u2019s his name?\n\nPablo, he\u2019s a Chihuahua.\n\nCute! That seems like a hot girl type of dog.\n\nI guess so, it\u2019s a bit Paris Hilton but he\u2019s OK. He doesn\u2019t make much noise, doesn\u2019t bark.\n\nMore chilled than Paris Hilton, maybe?\n\nYeah definitely. He\u2019s not a handbag dog, he uses his legs. He doesn\u2019t get carried. I don\u2019t regret it but it\u2019s definitely a spontaneous decision that I wouldn\u2019t normally make. I had to leave him at home today because I went to get my lips done \u2013 I\u2019ve had them done before. The dog is something I wouldn\u2019t normally do, because it\u2019s a living creature I guess, like having a baby. It\u2019s definitely made me a bit calmer; I don\u2019t party as much. I work in a nightclub so it\u2019s nice to have a dog and do normal things.\n\nNEGINE JASMINE\n\nVICE: What\u2019s the most Hot Girl Summer thing you\u2019ve done?\n\nNegine Jasmine: I think it was dumping my boyfriend and then coming to Europe.\n\nThat\u2019s a big one. Where are you from?\n\nI\u2019m from the States but originally, I\u2019m Afghan.\n\nAre you on good terms with your boyfriend?\n\nWe are, yes but we don\u2019t speak.\n\nHow does it feel being single now?\n\nIt\u2019s overwhelming and everyone\u2019s just a wolf, almost. You feel like a little sheep and all the men are too much. It\u2019s weird because I didn\u2019t get approached as much when I was in a relationship, so maybe it\u2019s the energy you give off.\n\nWhere are you heading next?\n\nTurkey, by myself.\n\nHave you had any dates here?\n\nI think I accidentally went on a date. I only realised it was a date when he asked if we could go on another date. We\u2019d known each other through Instagram and he saw that I was in London. Otherwise, no. Now my friend\u2019s joined me out here for a bit and sometimes female friendships are way more important to spend energy on than men.\n\nThat's real hot girl shit. Is she a good companion?\n\nYeah, we both love to share food at restaurants, and she sleeps the same amount of hours as me.\n\n@bethankapur", "description": "\"Dumping my boyfriend and then coming to Europe.\"", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "Meera Navlakha", "David Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6d1ffb597b790008bc4620/lede/1567434137246-hot-girl-summer-megan-thee-stallion.jpeg?crop=0.9423xw:0.9987xh;0xw,0.0013xh&resize=1200:*"}
