I hated the way they looked and felt, like I had something caught in my throat or as Mitch Hedburg would say, \u201clike being strangled by a really weak guy, all day.\u201d But I finally came around to the style and let me tell you, turtlenecks are having a moment. From actual royal families to fictional \u201croyal\u201d families like the Roys on Succession, turtlenecks are a fall staple for a chic look without much effort. We\u2019ve rounded up some of the top turtlenecks to give your next fall outfit a new silhouette.\n\nSplendid 1x1 Rib Long Sleeve Turtleneck Tee T-Shirt, $58 on Amazon: Made from a mixture of cotton and rayon, this breathable turtleneck is one you\u2019ll want to keep around. It\u2019s a little bit stretchy yet not too thin, which is a fine line some brands don\u2019t achieve.\n\nThe Cotton Turtleneck Tee, $28 at Everlane: Is there a basic that Everlane can\u2019t make great? 100% cotton and lightweight, wear it as a shirt with a pair of jeans and a blazer or layer it under a chunky sweater for maximum warmth.\n\nPima Cotton Turtleneck, $30 at L.L.Bean: You can\u2019t really go wrong with a classic. L.L.Bean\u2019s affinity for quality and affordability gives you a wide range of options and this Pima cotton turtleneck is at the top of the bunch. Seriously, it has a 4.4-star rating with over 1,000 reviews.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
