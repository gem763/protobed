Tehran uses this group to spin its propaganda and it's shameful Mr Corbyn has embraced it.'\n\nThe criticism of the group centres around comments made by its directors, Massoud Shadjareh, Azru Merali and Nazim Ali.\n\nMr Ali attracted attention in 2017 when he was accused of whipping up hatred against Israel in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.\n\nIHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh (left) and director Nazim Ali (right) have previously made controversial comments attacking Israel\n\nMr Corbyn was pictured with Professor of Islamic Law Hatem Bazian at a book launch organised by IHRC in 2016\n\nAt the Al Quds march in June that year, Mr Ali said: 'As we know in Grenfell, many innocents were murdered by Theresa May's cronies, many of which are supporters of Zionist ideology.'\n\nHe also told crowds: 'Let us not forget that some of the biggest corporations who have supported the Conservative Party are Zionists.\n\n'They are responsible for the murder of the people in Grenfell, in those towers in Grenfell, the Zionist supporters of the Conservative Party.'\n\nHe later claimed the comments were taken out of context and that calling Theresa May a Zionists was 'hardly controversial'.\n\nWomen's rights campaigner Masih Alinejad said Mr Corbyn's association with IHRC is 'shameful'\n\nIHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh has meanwhile praised Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini,\n\nHe told Iran's Press TV earlier this year that: 'The reality is that Iran is now undoubtedly the only nation which is standing against oppression, against tyranny, against colonialism, and for independence of people in line with Islam.'\n\nHe was also filmed at a march in 2017 suggesting Israel supported ISIS.\n\nThe Times investigation comes after a report by the thinktank The Henry Jackson Society claimed that IHRC was 'driven by a Khomeinist worldview, complete with the Ayatollah\u2019s animosity towards the West.'\n\nThe report quoted a 2014 discussion in which another of IHRC's directors, Arzu Merali, said: 'We know who the enemy is, we know that it\u2019s the West, it's the NATO countries and on a more philosophical level it\u2019s the structure \u2026 the white supremacist structure or the liberal structure \u2026 that we\u2019re all essentially suffering at the hands of.'\n\nIn response to The Times investigation published today, an IHRC said that aligning its directors to a country based on their ethnicity is 'essentially a racist enterprise'.\n\nFollowing the publication of the Henry Jackson Society report earlier this year, the group insisted: 'Maligning IHRC or any other civil society organisation, activists, academics not only serves to exclude them... but it reproduces the type of demonization of Muslims as \"pro-terrorist\" that results in murderous attacks like that of Darren Osborne two years ago.'\n\nThe group have been contacted for comment.\n\nA Labour party spokesman said: 'Jeremy Corbyn is a long-standing campaigner for human rights across the world, including in Iran.'\n\nLabour cited Mr Corbyn's condemnation of Iran's torture and execution of protesters and support for the campaign to free Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe as times when he has criticised Iran.", "description": "The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC), based in London, have received more than \u00a31million from a charity since 2013, including \u00a3250,000 in taxpayer-funded gift aid.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19534866-0-image-a-29_1570704809552.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
