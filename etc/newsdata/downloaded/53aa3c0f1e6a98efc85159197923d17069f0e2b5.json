The teams are tasked with hammering out the details of a potential unity government.\n\nNetanyahu was charged by Rivlin on Wednesday night with trying to form a government based on the strength of his pact with right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties to negotiate as a bloc of 55 MKs, and given 28 days to do so. Gantz, his rival, heads a bloc of 54 MKs from the center, left and Arab parties, but 10 Arab MKs in that group would not join a Gantz-led coalition. Neither candidate has a clear path to a 61-strong Knesset majority.\n\nRivlin therefore proposed a unity government in which power would be equally divided and Netanyahu and Gantz would each serve two years as prime minister. Rivlin implied, but did not specify, that Netanyahu would take an open-ended leave of absence when or if he is indicted in one of more of the three criminal probes for which he faces charges, including one count of bribery, pending a hearing. Under the arrangement set out by Rivlin, Gantz, as \u201cinterim prime minister,\u201d would enjoy all prime ministerial authority.\n\nRead more here.", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu is considering \u201creturning the mandate\u201d given to him by President Reuven Rivlin to form a Knesset majority.", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/bibi-netanyahu-1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
