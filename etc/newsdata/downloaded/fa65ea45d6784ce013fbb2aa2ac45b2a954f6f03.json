REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nSome Sunrise investors say the 6.3 billion franc price tag for cable operator UPC is too expensive. They have opposed the Swiss telecoms group\u2019s plan to raise 2.8 billion francs to fund the purchase and raised concerns that Liberty Global was not taking part in the deal.\n\nLiberty Global, set up by U.S. cable pioneer John Malone, said on Monday it had offered to buy up to 500 million Swiss francs in newly created Sunrise shares (SRCG.S) as a way of easing through the capital hike needed to clinch the sale.\n\nIf fully utilised, Liberty Global\u2019s ownership in Sunrise would reach 7.8% at current market prices, while Liberty Global will also receive one board seat as long as its shareholding exceeds 5%.\n\nSunrise shareholders will vote on the capital increase needed to complete the deal on Oct. 23, with a Reuters survey showing at least 30% of Sunrise shares, including German group Freenet (FNTGn.DE), against the capital hike.\n\nFreenet, which holds nearly a quarter of Sunrise\u2019s shares, said on Monday it still opposed what would be Switzerland\u2019s biggest telecoms deal, despite Liberty Global\u2019s offer.\n\nShares of Sunrise gained 1.9% in early trading, before retreating to trade 0.4% higher after Freenet\u2019s comments.\n\nRelated Coverage Freenet still rejects Sunrise deal despite Liberty Global offer\n\nSIMPLE MAJORITY\n\nSunrise, which competes with state-controlled Swisscom (SCMN.S), needs a simple majority to back the equity issue, which has been scaled back from 4.1 billion Swiss francs originally planned.\n\nProxy adviser ISS has recommended shareholders vote against the rights issue. Other proxy advisors Glass Lewis, Ethos, and zRating have recommended Sunrise shareowners approve the capital increase.\n\n\u201cWe have always believed in the logic of this combination. It creates a national powerhouse that will provide a fully-converged challenger to Swisscom and represents a smart and accretive transaction for both Sunrise and Liberty shareholders,\u201d said Mike Fries, CEO of Liberty Global.\n\nSunrise welcomed the Liberty Global\u2019s offer, saying its financial contribution would lessen the commitment needed from Sunrise shareholders, while Liberty\u2019s presence on the board would benefit the company.\n\n\u201cLiberty Global is a leading global cable operator and will bring considerable experience to our board to support management in running the combined business and delivering on our identified, actionable synergies,\u201d said Sunrise chairman Peter Kurer.\n\nFreenet said it remained of the opinion that the deal was not a good one.\n\n\u201cThe participation of Liberty Global changes nothing in our opinion or that of the majority of shareholders about the deal,\u201d the German telecoms company said.\n\n\u201cLiberty Global has merely said it will participate at rock bottom prices with the money they will receive from a too expensive sale.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Swiss telecom company Sunrise's logo is seen at its headquarters in Opfikon, Switzerland February 18, 2019. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nLiberty Global will have to go further to appease Sunrise shareholders concerned about the deal\u2019s cost, analysts said.\n\n\u201cIf Freenet, activists and ISS maintain their position as we suspect they will, Liberty Global will need to move on the price to get the deal done,\u201d said Berenberg analyst Usman Ghazi.", "description": "Liberty Global has offered a 500 million Swiss franc ($501.45 million) sweetener to rescue the sale of its Swiss cable and TV business to Sunrise Communications but a key Sunrise shareholder said it remained opposed to the deal.", "authors": ["John Revill", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440676938&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0RW", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
