It was 25 years ago so you can take your political nature and do whatever you want with it.\"\n\nThe 78-year-old, who is part of the BBC's cricket commentary team for the current Ashes series, added: \"It's very difficult to prove your innocence in another country, in another language.\n\n\"I have to live with it - and I do. I'm clear in my mind, and I think most people in England are, that it's not true.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Geoffrey Boycott said his knighthood had been soured\n\nIn a subsequent interview, Boycott said that the day had been \"soured\" by Radio 4 \"setting me up\", saying the station's agenda had been to talk about domestic violence and \"make publicity\".\n\nHe told BBC's Look North Yorkshire: \"Is that what interviewing is about - is it always to ask difficult questions? Shouldn't it be just a nice day for me?\n\n\"I said I don't give a toss about her [Ms Claire from Woman's Aid], not domestic violence. That's not something anyone should feel good about.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Today programme said the question was \"entirely appropriate... given the concerns raised about Geoffrey Boycott's knighthood by Women's Aid and others\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Boycott scored 8,114 runs in 108 Tests for England from 1964 to 1982\n\nThe shadow minister for women and equalities, Dawn Butler, joined the call for Boycott's knighthood to be rescinded.\n\n\"Honouring a perpetrator of domestic violence just because he is the former prime minister's favourite sportsman shows how out of touch and nepotistic the honours list is,\" she said, adding that the whole system needed \"radically overhauling\".\n\nAnd former Spice Girl Melanie Brown tweeted that Boycott was \"a disgrace to Yorkshire\", saying the \"perpetrators of domestic abuse shouldn't be held up as heroes EVER\".\n\nThe Woman's Trust charity said it was \"disappointed\" to see Boycott included in the honour's list because it either suggested that, despite his conviction, he was believed over the survivor, or his fame meant it did not matter.\n\nBoycott also had to apologise in 2017 after joking that he would have to \"black up\" to be given a knighthood, reportedly saying they were handed out to West Indian cricketers \"like confetti\".\n\nMrs May once compared her determination to delivering Brexit with the fighting spirit in Boycott's batting marathons.\n\nTelling journalists he was one of her sporting heroes, she said in November 2018: \"Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it and he got the runs in the end.\"\n\nSince his retirement from cricket, Boycott has gone on to become a successful broadcaster and is part of the BBC's cricket commentary team.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"He is a world renowned cricketer and employed for his knowledge and expertise of the sport.\"\n\nThe government checks all nominees are suitable for an honour, including whether they have paid their taxes.\n\nHowever, Mrs May's resignation honours list would not have gone through the same review process as nominations for the New Year and Queen's Birthday honours.\n\nIn those cases, a specific committee, for example one including figures from the world of sport, would consider the nominations before they go before the main honours committee. In contrast, people nominated for resignation honours only undergo propriety and probity checks by the Cabinet Office.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill were Mrs May's closest advisers before the 2017 general election\n\nThe 37 men and 20 women on Mrs May's list include members of Downing Street staff, political aides and lifelong supporters of the Conservative Party.\n\nIt includes recipients from all four nations of the UK as well as non-political figures and members of civic society.\n\nLabour said the honours rewarded \"big Tory donors and No 10 cronies\".\n\nNick Timothy and Fiona Hill, Mrs May's former chiefs of staff who left their jobs after the 2017 general election in which the Conservatives lost their majority in the Commons, become Commanders of the Order of the British Empire, or CBEs.\n\nThe former prime minister's chief EU negotiator Olly Robbins receives a knighthood.\n\nThe senior civil servant helped to create Mrs May's Brexit deal before it was defeated in Parliament three times.

She is one of just a few non-political figures on Mrs May's list.\n\nSir Simon Woolley, the founder of operation Black Vote, and Ruth Hunt, the ex-chief executive of Stonewall, have been made crossbench life peers.\n\nBritish Empire Medals, or BEMs, have been awarded to Graham Howarth and Debra Wheatley - Mrs May's head chef at Chequers and housekeeper at Downing Street respectively.\n\nThe list of peerages - which sees those appointed sit in the House of Lords - include several nominated by other parties to sit on their benches.\n\n'Policy of restraint'\n\nAmong them are former NUT general secretary Christine Blower, for Labour, and former Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who will become the party's second peer in the House of Lords.\n\nThe Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, said Mrs May's list was \"substantially smaller\" than those drawn up by predecessors, helping to reduce the size of the House of Lords.\n\nSeveral MPs have received honours:\n\nSir Patrick McLoughlin, Conservative MP for Derbyshire Dales (Companion of Honour)\n\nGeorge Hollingbery, Conservative MP for Meon Valley (Knighthood)\n\nDavid Lidington, Conservative MP for Aylesbury (Knighthood)\n\nCharles Walker, Conservative MP for Broxbourne (Knighthood)\n\nBrandon Lewis, Conservative MP for Great Yarmouth (CBE)\n\nJulian Smith, Conservative MP for Skipton and Ripon (CBE)\n\nSeema Kennedy, Conservative MP for South Ribble (OBE)\n\nJohn Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw and an independent government adviser on anti-Semitism, received a non-affiliated peerage.\n\nMr Mann is standing down as MP, citing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's handling of the party's anti-Semitism crisis.\n\nMargaret Ritchie, who was leader of the SDLP in Northern Ireland between 2010 and 2011, also received a non-affiliated peerage. She said she would remain \"SDLP to the core\" even though she has had to quit the party to become a peer.\n\nThe former South Down MP made history in 2010 when she became the first leader of a nationalist party to wear a remembrance poppy.\n\nA source close to Mrs May said the list \"recognises the many different people who have made a significant contribution to public life\" during her political career.\n\nCriticising Mrs May's choices, Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: \"It comes as no surprise that big Tory donors and Number 10 cronies are being honoured yet again.\n\n\"The Tories only care about looking after their own and will only stand up for the wealthy few who fund them.\"\n\nThe SNP's Pete Wishart accused Mrs May of \"handing out peerages like sweeties\", adding that it was the \"worst kind of cronyism\".", "description": "Theresa May's decision to knight the former cricketer is condemned by domestic abuse charities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mxynp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
