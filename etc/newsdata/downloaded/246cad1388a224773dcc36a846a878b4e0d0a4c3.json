One is cassoulet, based on white beans and a blend of goose, duck and pork. The better alternative for my purposes was choucroute garnie, a vat of simmering sauerkraut that serves as a nice bed on which to mix and match a variety of pig parts.\n\nThe beauty of a choucroute is that it lets you use whatever pork products you like or have on hand. A couple of hours later, the meat is cooked through while the sauerkraut has absorbed all the porky, smoky flavors, utterly transforming from pickled and puckery into something brawny in flavor and meltingly soft, especially if you add a couple of apples to bring out the cabbage\u2019s sweeter nature.\n\nPigs\u2019 feet are not necessarily traditional in choucroute, but they add excellent flavor and body to the mix. If you are like my husband and prefer to eat your meat with a knife and fork (and I know that he is not alone in that department), you can always leave them out.\n\nFeatured in: Pigs\u2019 Feet That Don\u2019t Step On Anyone\u2019s Toes.", "description": "Two classic mixed braises always come to mind at this time of year One is cassoulet, based on white beans and a blend of goose, duck and pork The better alternative for my purposes was choucroute garnie, a vat of simmering sauerkraut that serves as a nice bed on which to mix and match a variety of pig parts", "authors": ["Melissa Clark", "Mark Bittman", "Joan Nathan", "Jennifer Steinhauer", "Pierre Franey", "Craig Claiborne", "David Tanis", "Genevieve Ko", "Alison Roman", "Colu Henry"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/braised-sauerkrait-pork/braised-sauerkrait-pork-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "published_at": "2014-04-02"}
