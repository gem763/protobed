REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nMugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years until he was ousted by his own army in November 2017, died in a Singapore hospital six days ago aged 95.\n\nHis body arrived in Zimbabwe from Singapore on Wednesday and started three days of lying in state on Thursday.\n\nMugabe is proving as polarising in death as he was in life, as the fight over where he will be buried threatens to undermine President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe\u2019s former deputy who conspired to overthrow him.\n\nMnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party want Mugabe buried at a national monument to heroes of the liberation war against white minority rule, in an attempt to unite the country behind their political and economic agenda. The government had planned for a state funeral on Saturday and then burial on Sunday.\n\nBut some of Mugabe\u2019s relatives have pushed back against that plan. They share Mugabe\u2019s bitterness at the way former allies including Mnangagwa toppled him and want him buried in his home village some 85 km (50 miles) from Harare.\n\nLeo Mugabe, the late president\u2019s nephew, said the burial ceremony would be private, without saying where it would be.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you (where it will be) then it won\u2019t be private,\u201d he said. \u201cThe family is the one that makes a decision,\u201d he added.\n\nSnubbing a burial at National Heroes Acre, a grandiose monument on a hill overlooking Harare, would be a major snub to Mnangagwa, the ruling party Mugabe helped found and the country\u2019s liberation war veterans, who broke with Mugabe in 2016 and endorsed Mnangagwa\u2019s rise to power.\n\nThe family issued a statement saying it was concerned about the manner in which the government was preparing the programme for Mugabe\u2019s funeral \u201cwithout consulting his immediate family\u201d.\n\nThe family \u201calso observed with shock that the Government of Zimbabwe is attempting to coerce us to accept a programme for funeral and burial\u201d that was contrary to Mugabe\u2019s wishes, the statement said.\n\nPAYING RESPECTS\n\nMnangagwa, flanked by security and half a dozen soldiers carrying rifles, visited Mugabe\u2019s palatial home, known as Blue Roof, in the capital on Thursday to pay his respects.\n\nA choir wearing yellow T-shirts bearing Mnangagwa\u2019s face sang songs as he arrived. Around a hundred well-wishers sat under a marquee on a lawn beneath the main house, waiting for their turn to see the coffin.\n\n\u201cAs long as ZANU-PF is in power and as long as I am leading, no one will deviate, you remain our icon, our commander and founding father,\u201d Mnangagwa said of Mugabe, addressing relatives and associates in the room where the coffin draped in the Zimbabwean flag was being kept.\n\nMugabe\u2019s body was later flown to the Rufaro soccer stadium in Harare\u2019s Mbare informal statement, where thousands of mourners filed past the open coffin.\n\nThere was a brief stampede, as people rushed forward to get their chance to catch a glimpse of their former leader.\n\nThe body was expected to be on display at the stadium, the venue where he took his first oath at independence in 1980, for another day on Friday before a state funeral planned for the national sports stadium on Saturday.\n\nTrust Nyakabawo, a Mbare resident, told Reuters at the Rufaro stadium that he wanted Mugabe to be buried at National Heroes Acre along with other liberation fighters.\n\n\u201cWe are in pain after his death because we were so used to seeing him alive as a father figure that led the country well. We need him to go to Heroes Acre,\u201d another mourner, Prisca Mutandi, said as the helicopter carrying Mugabe\u2019s coffin landed outside the stadium.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nMany Zimbabweans remember Mugabe as their country\u2019s liberator from white minority rule and praise him for broadening people\u2019s access to education and land.\n\nBut that memory is also tinged with sadness, as he presided over an economy wrecked by hyperinflation, shortages and deeply entrenched corruption, and left a divided nation with loyalties split between the country\u2019s two largest political parties, ZANU-PF and the opposition MDC.\n\nMnangagwa has found it hard to revive the economy, and steps his government has taken this year to reintroduce the Zimbabwean dollar have spurred steep price rises that have compounded people\u2019s daily hardships.", "description": "Zimbabwe's former president, Robert Mugabe, will be buried at a private ceremony at a date still to be decided, his family said on Thursday, in an embarrassment for his successor who wants him interred at a national shrine on Sunday.", "authors": ["Macdonald Dzirutwe", "Alexander Winning", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429130379&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1KQ"}
