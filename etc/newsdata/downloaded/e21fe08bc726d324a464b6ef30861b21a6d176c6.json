(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the late 1980s, young Raina Telgemeier tried to deliver a report in front of her grade-school class in San Francisco. Before she could finish, she bolted for the restroom, gripped by the symptoms of her intense anxiety.\n\nOn Labor Day weekend last month, Telgemeier, now a celebrated 42-year-old graphic novelist, strode onto the main stage at the National Book Festival in Washington before a thrumming crowd of about 4,000 fans. Radiating confidence, she smiled broadly as she shared her story of nerves and nausea. It is a message of empathy and reassurance that encourages young listeners to talk about what scares them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to tell you at this moment,\u201d Telgemeier said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a stomach ache.\u201d\n\nThere was laughter among her ponytailed legions. Over the past decade, the accidental memoirist has grown into a YA rock star by becoming an open book. Telgemeier\u2019s largely autobiographical stories are so accessible and emotionally resonant that there are 13.5 million copies of them in print, as she\u2019s tapped into a largely overlooked comics-loving female readership.\n\nNow, because her fans kept asking, she is getting more personal than ever. The Eisner Award-winning author who launched her publishing empire with 2010\u2032s \u201cSmile,\u201d about her years-long dental adventures as a kid, is prepared to bare new parts of her interior world with \u201cGuts,\u201d available Tuesday, which centers on how fear affected her body.\n\n\n\nRaina Telgemeier's new book. (Scholastic Graphix, 2019)\n\n\u201cThis is the reality of my life,\u201d Telgemeier told her fans. She quickly got to the heart and GI tract of the matter: \u201cI was subject to panic attacks and [was] worrying that something was really wrong with me.\u201d\n\nA young girl in a bright-fuchsia shirt soon asked which of Telgemeier\u2019s books was the author\u2019s favorite \u2014 from a shelf that includes not only \u201cSmile\u201d but also such other New York Times bestsellers as \u201cSisters,\u201d \u201cDrama\u201d and \u201cGhosts.\u201d The author nodded to a few titles before replying: \u201cI like \u2018Guts\u2019 because it\u2019s so personal and because people are really getting to know me, the person, when they read \u2018Guts.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nKids line up to ask Raina Telgemeier questions at her 2019 National Book Festival talk. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nOn one level, she said in an interview the previous day, the book is about how her anxiety manifested itself. Beginning in fourth grade, she developed a fear of vomit (termed \u201cemetophobia\u201d) and of how her \u201cguts\u201d acted up, which in turn triggered fear about her food choices. On another level, the title refers to mustering the courage to receive treatment and share one\u2019s honest vulnerabilities with people who care about you. (Seven percent of Americans age 3 to 17 \u2014 more than 4 million young people \u2014 have been diagnosed with anxiety, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)\n\nUnlike previous Telgemeier books that were dedicated to people close to her, \u201cGuts\u201d is dedicated to \u201canyone who feels afraid.\u201d That signals the approachable tone of the memoir, which tries to help destigmatize mental illness and therapy and provide paths to discussion among young readers.\n\nTelgemeier notes in the \u201cGuts\u201d afterword that she has employed various therapies and meditation apps and has taken anxiety medication, writing: \u201cThey\u2019ve all helped, but I\u2019ve realized that my phobias and worries are just part of who I am. I do my best to manage them!\"\n\n\n\nA page from Raina Telgemeier's new graphic novel, \"Guts.\" (Scholastic Graphix, 2019)\n\nIt is that kind of comforting honesty that especially appeals to millions of students.\n\n\u201cKids today are reading more comic books and graphic novels than ever, and Raina is a big reason why,\u201d said Gene Luen Yang, the acclaimed graphic novelist (\u201cAmerican Born Chinese\u201d) and past Library of Congress ambassador for Young People\u2019s Literature. \u201cShe\u2019s a true comics superstar who essentially created a brand new category of comics in the American market: middle-grade graphic memoir.\n\n\u201cI still remember hearing discussions in the \u201890s about whether or not girls would read comics \u2014 ridiculous, of course, but Raina\u2019s work has proven just how ridiculous,\u201d continued Yang, a longtime schoolteacher. \u201cNot to say that only girls read Raina\u2019s work.\"\n\nDuring a photo op session at the recent festival, Telgemeier\u2019s fans lined up by the hundreds while clutching her pastel-color-covered books, hungry to know more about how she once coped with irritating siblings and bullying classmates and a changing mind and body. She draws her life stories, and they feel seen.\n\nOne young festivalgoer asked Telgemeier how she finds inspiration for her stories. The author replied that she sometimes asks herself: \u201cWhat was the weirdest thing that I experienced in middle school?\u201d\n\nIt took Telgemeier many years before she was ready to share from her own experience. Between ages 11 and 25, she kept a private diary created in comics format. She was inspired by such strips as \u201cFor Better or for Worse\u201d and \u201cCalvin and Hobbes,\u201d as well as the book series \u201cThe Baby-Sitters Club.\"\n\nIn 2002, shortly before graduation from the School of Visual Arts in New York, she created a short comic about the power of reading the Hiroshima graphic novel \u201cBarefoot Gen\u201d \u2014 a gift from her father when she was 9. It caught the attention of the publisher Scholastic, which soon hired her to illustrate \u201cThe Baby-Sitters Club.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before Telgemeier pitched her own story to Scholastic editors.\n\nTelgemeier said some people had doubted whether a memoir about her braces could be popular. But her breakthrough \u201cSmile\u201d is not just about her nearly five-year saga of facial reconstruction after accidentally smashing her front teeth in 1989 but also about the fragile nature of friendship and stirring insecurities in middle school. Students read; critics raved.\n\nEven after the success of \u201cSmile,\u201d though, it was a long personal journey to \u201cGuts,\u201d her third memoir. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was ready to come out of the gate and just start writing about poop,\u201d she said with a laugh. Besides, there was some personal work to be done.\n\nFive years ago, she began cognitive behavioral therapy because anxiety \u201cwas starting to impede my life,\u201d she said. But, \u201cWhen I went to tackle the thing in my life, I started to see the story in it and started to tell the story \u2014 because when you go into a therapist\u2019s office, they want to know why you\u2019re there, and where you are. They want to see how it all connects.\u201d\n\nTelgemeier was already 80 pages into a different story at the time. But then she developed writer\u2019s block. While she was stuck, a friend asked about the author\u2019s passing anecdote about anxiety \u2014 that \u201cstomach story.\u201d Telgemeier had never written it down, but the friend\u2019s question immediately sparked inspiration.\n\n\u201cI said: \u2018You know what? I\u2019ve got to go!\u2019 \u201d she recounted. \u201cI just sat down, and 11 hours later I had the first couple of chapters sketched out. So it was all in there.\u201d\n\n\n\nA page from Raina Telgemeier's new graphic novel, \"Guts.\" (Scholastic Graphix, 2019)\n\nThe Bay Area-based author set out to write the kind of book about phobias and anxieties that she wishes had been available to her as a kid. \u201cReading is where you find your common ground with others,\u201d Telgemeier said. As a child, \u201cSometimes you might not know another kid who\u2019s in therapy or tackling a really heavy thing in their life, but you might read a book about it and find yourself.\"\n\nThis year, Telgemeier published the creative guide book \u201cShare Your Smile,\u201d to prompt her fans to write and draw their own tales. Now, as she goes on tour in support of \u201cGuts\u201d \u2014 which has already charted as an Amazon top-10 bestseller \u2014 she continues to encourage her readers to express their feelings: \u201cYou can\u2019t connect unless you open up.\u201d\n\nTelgemeier hears from adults whose children identify with young Raina on the page and see Telgemeier now as a peer to their parents. Such connections spark healthy family conversations. \u201cI think,\u201d she said, \u201cwe could all stand to be emotionally healthier.\u201d\n\nThe author believes in addressing many aspects of grade school head-on, including LGBT representation. Her book \u201cDrama,\u201d inspired by her high school theater club experience, features a gay character whose sibling is coming to terms with his sexual identity. The graphic novel won a Stonewall Book Award while also being banned multiple times in Texas.\n\nSo will Telgemeier end her memoir series as a trilogy? \u201cI feel like three is a really good number,\u201d she said at the festival.\n\nShe then noted playfully: \u201cBut I have one or two more stories from my childhood that I might want to tell. So maybe I will.\u201d\n\nRaina Telgemeier will appear Saturday and Sunday at the Small Press Expo at the Bethesda North Marriott Hotel & Conference Center in Maryland.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Ghosts\u2019 is an inviting Day of the Dead feast for young minds\n\nRaina Telgemeier offers up an ode to reading", "description": "The graphic novelist has sold millions by baring her soul and tapping into a largely-overlooked female comics readership.", "authors": ["Michael Cavna", "Writer Artist For Comic Riffs", "Covering Visual Storytelling", "Cartoon Art Illustration", "Comedy Satire", "Writer Artist Visual Storyteller Michael Cavna Is Creator Of The Comic Riffs Column", "Graphic-Novel Reviewer For The Washington Post'S Book World."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_EOA2uuzRV8zSRH5ZiG1x3t6xlQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VOQ2WRWPHAI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
