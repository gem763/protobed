The first holding company, IPG, formed in 1961 when ad agency McCann tried to avoid a conflict with Coca-Cola by creating a larger company whose other divisions could work with the soda giant's competitors. As if to demonstrate why that approach was necessary, Nestle stopped working with McCann two years later because the agency acquired Erwin Wasey & Co., whose clients included Nestle rival Carnation.\n\nMore forgiving clients could also theoretically allow agencies' consulting divisions to pitch against management firms such as Bain and McKinsey, which have long used their work with one company to sell services to its adversaries.\n\n\"Two accounts in the same industry is a conflict, but three is an expertise,\" Wieser joked.\n\nWill the new model ultimately work for brands?\n\nAccording to the same observers, McDonald's shift to Wieden simply proves that company structure and client policy are irrelevant if the resulting creative work isn't good.\n\nMultiple sources who worked on the McDonald's account at Omnicom also said the dedicated holding company approach, combined with a corporate structure that requires a board run by McDonald's owner-operators around the country to approve all major ad campaigns, didn't always allow good ideas to break through.\n\nOne example of this strategic disagreement between agency and client centered on an idea to produce an LP for McDonald's that would have been made entirely of bacon, Business Insider reported earlier.\n\nGreg Paull, principal at marketing consultancy R3, said the McDonald's-Omnicom partnership \"never gelled creatively.\"\n\n\"[Fast-food] is an incredibly demanding daily business with overnight sales results,\" he said. \"Without innovation and creativity, the weak will not survive.\"\n\n\"All [the KFC decision] tells us is that there's someone smart at McDonald's who wants an agency that can create good advertising,\" said Bob Hoffman, agency executive and creator of the popular Ad Contrarian blog and newsletter. \"Now the question is, will they let them?\"\n\nPattisall remains skeptical, stating that McDonald's abandoning the dedicated unit model is \"a big loss for creativity.\" He described the decision to divide the business among Omnicom and other agencies, rather than maintaining a single cohesive unit to handle wide-ranging responsibilities like digital, social, client loyalty marketing, and TV work, as \"counter-productive.\"\n\nThe Forrester analyst compared the divided model to those of decades past, when clients would bring on specialist agencies for each of these disciplines and force them to collaborate. \"It didn't work then, and it won't work now,\" he said.\n\nMcDonald's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "McDonald's recently shifted its lead US creative duties to Wieden and Kennedy, which means the fast-food giant will share an agency with rival KFC.", "authors": ["Patrick Coffee"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8be6842e22af48e20b8fce?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
