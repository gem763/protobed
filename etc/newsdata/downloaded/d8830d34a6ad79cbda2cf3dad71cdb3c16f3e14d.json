Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, says it was \u201ca consensual personal relationship.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times first reported about the lawsuit.\n\nThe NFL declined to comment. Messages were left seeking comment from the Patriots.\n\nBrown was released by the Oakland Raiders last week after clashing with the team throughout training camp. He agreed to a contract with New England on Saturday, but has yet to play for the Patriots.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The New York Jets are getting some roster help from the most unlikely of sources: Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots.\n\nAdam Gase\u2019s squad acquired wide receiver Demaryius Thomas from the Patriots for a 2021 sixth-round draft pick on Tuesday, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the teams had not yet announced the trade.\n\nThe deal is the first trade between the AFC East rivals since Belichick took over as the Patriots\u2019 coach in 2000. The last trade between the teams was actually when Belichick left the Jets for the Patriots, and New York got a first-round pick.\n\nThomas became expendable for the Patriots when they signed Antonio Brown over the weekend.\n\nThe 31-year-old Thomas gives the Jets\u2019 receiving group an immediate boost, joining Robby Anderson, Quincy Enunwa and Jamison Crowder.\n\n-By Pro Football Writer Dennis Waszak.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - New York Jets defensive lineman Nathan Shepherd was suspended six games Tuesday by the NFL for violating the league\u2019s policy on performance-enhancers.\n\nShepherd will be eligible to return to the Jets\u2019 active roster on Oct. 28, following New York\u2019s game at Jacksonville.\n\nShepherd was inactive for the Jets\u2019 season opener against Buffalo on Sunday. The second-year defensive lineman from Fort Hays State was a third-round draft pick by New York last year. The native of Ajax, Ontario, had 18 tackles and five quarterback hits while starting five of 16 games as a rookie.\n\nShepherd told NFL.com he failed two tests this summer - on June 27 and July 25 - while recovering from shoulder and groin injuries. He added that an MRI on his groin revealed a sports hernia, and his hunched posture after having that procedure resulted in two herniated disks in his back.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nMIAMI (AP) - Milwaukee Brewers star Christian Yelich broke his right kneecap on a foul ball Tuesday night and will miss the rest of the regular season.\n\nThe Brewers didn\u2019t say whether the reigning NL MVP might be able to return for the playoffs that begin Oct. 1 if they make it that far. Milwaukee began the day two games behind the Chicago Cubs for the second NL wild-card spot.\n\nYelich fouled a ball off his right leg in the first inning against Miami. He was down on the ground for several minutes before limping off the field.\n\nYelich hit .329 with 44 home runs and 97 RBIs along with 30 stolen bases this season. The outfielder was leading the majors in slugging percentage and OPS when he was hurt.\n\nTrent Grisham continued Yelich\u2019s at-bat with a 1-2 count and struck out - the strikeout was charged to Yelich.\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) - The Los Angeles Dodgers clinched their seventh consecutive NL West title in fitting fashion, using two home runs by Corey Seager and a masterful pitching performance by Walker Buehler to beat the Baltimore Orioles 7-3 on Tuesday night.\n\nAfter the final out, the first team in the majors to clinch a playoff spot this season gathered at the mound for a subdued celebration that included a wardrobe change for a pending champagne celebration in the clubhouse.\n\nLos Angeles, coming off consecutive World Series losses to Houston and Boston and seeking its first title since 1988, will likely begin the postseason at Dodger Stadium on Oct. 3 against the NL wild-card team.\n\nThe Dodgers, with a power-packed lineup and imposing rotation, gained sole possession of first place on April 17 and never looked back. Their final pursuer was the Arizona Diamondbacks, who started the day a whopping 17\u00bd games out of first place.\n\nThis is the earliest that Los Angeles (94-52) has ever clinched the division, both in terms of date and games. The 1977 team did it in Game 151, and the 2013 club clinched on Sept. 19.\n\nLast year, the Dodgers didn\u2019t wrap up the division until the 163rd game of the season, defeating Colorado in a playoff on Oct. 1.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The Minnesota Twins have placed center fielder Byron Buxton and his ailing left shoulder on the 60-day injured list, ending his season and leaving the American League Central leaders without their best defensive player for the rest of the pennant race and beyond.\n\nMinnesota made the move on Tuesday before a three-game series against Washington, as Buxton was having surgery to repair a damaged labrum. Manager Rocco Baldelli said Buxton likely would need five to six months to recover, putting his readiness for the start of spring training in question.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nThe New Jersey Devils have re-signed restricted free agent center Pavel Zacha to a three-year, $6.75 million contract.\n\nThe signing on Tuesday happened days before the Devils open training camp.\n\nIn a statement released by the team Tuesday, Shero said he was pleased to have the contract completed and called Zacha an \u201cimportant part of our team.\u201d\n\nThe 22-year-old Zacha is from the Czech Republic and had a career-best 13 goals in 61 games last season. Overall, he has 29 goals and 47 assists for 76 points in 201 career NHL games.\n\nGOLF\n\nGLENEAGLES, Scotland (AP) - The United States was forced into a change three days before the start of the Solheim Cup after Stacy Lewis pulled out because of a back injury.\n\nU.S. captain Juli Inkster replaced Lewis with Ally McDonald, who will make her debut in the team event.\n\nLewis, who was one of Inkster\u2019s two captain\u2019s picks, is a former No. 1 in the world ranking and a two-time major champion. She would have been playing in her fifth Solheim Cup.\n\nLewis said her back injury flared up last week, and has decided to withdraw \u201cin the best interest of the team.\u201d\n\nAUTO RACING\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Paul Menard has decided to walk away from NASCAR\u2019s top level after more than 460 races and Wood Brothers Racing is replacing him with Matt DiBenedetto in the iconic No. 21 Ford next season.\n\nAfter spending 16 years in the Cup Series, Menard said Tuesday he wants to step back from full-time racing to spend more time with his family. The 39-year-old driver, whose only win came at the Brickyard 400 in 2011, has two young children with his wife, Jennifer.\n\nMenard joins David Ragan in becoming the second veteran driver to retire this season.\n\nHis decision is a gift to DiBenedetto, who has been solid this season but learned last month he wasn\u2019t being retained at Leavine Family Racing next year. And with few rides expected to be available this offseason, the 28-year-old DiBenedetto was unsure if he would land a competitive ride.\n\nPARIS (AP) - Seven-time Formula One champion Michael Schumacher has been admitted to a Paris hospital to be treated Tuesday with cutting-edge stem-cell therapy, according to a French newspaper.\n\nThe Paris hospitals authority, citing France\u2019s strict medical privacy rules, said it could not comment on the report in Le Parisien that Schumacher was admitted under tight guard Monday to the Georges-Pompidou hospital for transfusions of inflammation-reducing stem cells.\n\nThe newspaper said the 50-year-old German, who suffered a near-fatal brain injury in a 2013 skiing accident in the French Alps, was expected to be discharged on Wednesday.\n\nHis long-time manager, Sabine Kehm, had no comment.\n\nFollowing the accident, Schumacher\u2019s condition stabilized after he was placed in a drug-induced coma, from which he later emerged. Since September 2014, he has been cared for at home on the shores of Lake Geneva.\n\nSOCCER\n\nPARIS (AP) - Referees have been told by the head of French soccer to ignore a FIFA directive and no longer stop matches when there is homophobic chanting.\n\nIn response, anti-discrimination groups urged No\u00ebl Le Gra\u00ebt, the French Football Federation president, to resign.\n\nSeveral league games in the top two French divisions have been halted by referees this season. But Le Gra\u00ebt wants referees to let play continue if there are more homophobic chants, starting from this weekend.\n\nTENNIS\n\nJOHANNESBURG (AP) - Two-time Grand Slam finalist Kevin Anderson says he will take the rest of the 2019 season off as he continues to recover from a right knee injury.\n\nThe hard-serving South African hasn\u2019t played in a tournament since losing in the third round of Wimbledon in July, and pulled out of the U.S. Open because of his knee problems.\n\nHe said on Twitter on Tuesday that he will not play again until next year. In a statement, Anderson said: \u201cI have spoken with my team, consulted with doctors, and we have decided that the best course of action is to take the rest of the year off and prepare for 2020. This will give me enough time to undergo more rehab processes and get healthy.\u201d\n\nThe 33-year-old Anderson was the runner-up to Rafael Nadal at Flushing Meadows in 2017 and to Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last year.\n\nOBITUARY\n\nFormer Oakland Raiders linebacker Neiron Ball, who played college football at Florida after recovering from brain surgery, has died at age 27.\n\nBall\u2019s sister, Natalie Ball Myricks, released a statement announcing her brother\u2019s passing early Tuesday. Ball\u2019s agency, the Sports & Entertainment Group in Washington, D.C., confirmed his death to The Associated Press.\n\nBall\u2019s death came nearly a year after he suffered a brain aneurysm and was placed in a medically induced coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. In late July, the Ball family announced that the Georgia native was out of the coma but was a quadriplegic.\n\nBall sat out his sophomore season at Florida in 2011 because of a congenital condition called arteriovenous malformation, which causes the brain\u2019s blood vessels to get tangled and rupture. He recovered after a year away and played in 33 games - with 16 starts - during his final three seasons in Gainesville.\n\nVIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) - Brian Barnes, the charismatic English golfer who beat Jack Nicklaus twice in one day in Ryder Cup singles matches, has died after a short illness. He was 74.\n\nThe European Tour said Barnes, who had cancer, died on Monday with family members by his side.\n\nA nine-time winner on the European Tour, Barnes - known for playing with a pipe in his mouth and a bottle of vodka and orange juice in his bag - was most famous for his two victories over Nicklaus at Laurel Valley, Pennsylvania, in 1975 when the Ryder Cup was a contest between the United States and Britain & Ireland.\n\nBarnes won in the morning singles, 4 and 2, and Nicklaus asked U.S captain Arnold Palmer if he could play Barnes again in the afternoon. Bernard Hunt, Europe\u2019s captain, agreed to a change in the draw and Barnes won again, 2 and 1.\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) - Longtime sportscaster and announcer Fred McLeod has died at 67.\n\nMcLeod did TV play-by play coverage of the Detroit Pistons and Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThe Cavs said McLeod died suddenly Monday night but did not elaborate. They called him a \u201cgreat friend and teammate\u201d and a \u201cheart-felt ambassador.\u201d\n\nLeBron James, who helped end Cleveland\u2019s title drought, said on Twitter: \u201cMay you rest in Paradise my friend!\u201d\n\nA Cleveland-area native, McLeod called the Cavs\u2019 2016 NBA championship, the first title won by one of the city\u2019s three major sports franchises since 1964.\n\nMcLeod spent 22 seasons announcing Pistons games before joining the Cavs in 2006. He recently celebrated his 36th season in broadcasting. McLeod also served as a TV announcer for the Indians and Tigers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "NFL", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
