It took responders two hours to contain the fire, according to ABC News.\n\nGippsland firefighter commander Chris Loeschenkohl told ABC the situation presented unusual difficulties for the fire crews that fought the blaze.\n\n\u201cFirefighters went into a defensive mode initially to protect themselves, because there were also LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] cylinders at the neighbouring property, and they did a magnificent job,\u201d Loeschenkohl told ABC. \u201cThere was a couple of other flammable liquid cylinders stored within the building which did cause projectiles to exit the building.\u201d\n\nBonnie Barkmeyer, a journalist with WIN News Gippsland who was on the scene, also reported that firefighters were threatened by \u201cprojectiles.\u201d\n\nA fire has gutted the Yarram Herd Services building overnight, destroying around 100 cryogenic cylinders used to store cattle semen.

Committee vice-chairman of the company, Aaron Thomas, told ABC that 100 cryogenic cylinders were lost in the fire. He said that each container was worth $500 to $1000, excluding semen, and \u201cthe semen inside them varies in price.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming into the AI [artificial insemination] season so there would have been substantial amounts of semen inside the tanks that we\u2019ve lost, which was owned by our local farmers, and it can range in value from $5 per straw to $100 per straw,\u201d Thomas told ABC.\n\nThomas told the news outlet many farmers had semen stock in the now-destroyed building. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a huge blow, especially for our farmers,\u201d he said.", "description": "A fire in an Australian genetics laboratory has caused 100 cryogenic cylinders containing bull semen to explode, destroying thousands of dollars worth of semen stock, according to news.com.au....", "authors": ["James Whitbrook", "Jennings Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/wptsjomhv13cy3punn4j.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
