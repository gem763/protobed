Add Interest\n\nWhile former White House press secretary Sean Spicer earned the second-lowest score of the night, the highly controversial competitor broke Twitter with his neon green ruffled shirt.\n\nSpicer himself gave \"DWTS\" fans advance warning by tweeting Monday, \"Trust me, I certainly haven\u2019t forgotten and once you see the outfit I have to wear tonight you won\u2019t forget for quite some time -- even after lots of therapy.\"\n\nTrust me, I certainly haven\u2019t forgotten and once you see the outfit I have to wear tonight you won\u2019t forget for quite some time \u2014 even after lots of therapy Treat this like looking at an eclipse with a dot poked in a piece of paper ( @ABC 8pmET) #DWTS @DancingABC #DWTS28 https://t.co/w8IjOeua7X \u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) September 16, 2019\n\nSpicer also performed the strangest dance of the night, a salsa to \"Spice up Your Life\" with partner Lindsay Arnold. Spicer began the routine by excitedly playing the bongos -- judge Bruno Tonioli said it looked like he was being attacked by wasps.\n\nOn the flip side, the best dance of the night came from '90s heartthrob James Van Der Beek and partner Emma Slater. The two performed a smooth and mysterious tango to Imagine Dragons' \"Whatever It Takes\" and scored a 21/30 -- finishing in first place.\n\nAnother standout performance came from Sailor Brinkley-Cook, who wasn't even on the original \"DWTS\" roster. The model only had three days to practice her routine after her mother, actress and supermodel Christie Brinkley, tripped and broke her wrist during rehearsals. According to Brinkley, her doctor claimed it was the worst break he had ever seen.\n\nChristie Brinkley wore a thick cast on her right arm as she supported her daughter's dancing debut. Brinkley-Cook and partner Val Chmerkovskiy scored 18/30, earned rave reviews from all three judges and finished the night in fourth place.\n\nThe worst dance of the night came from NBA star Lamar Odom, who stands a full one foot and three inches above dancing partner Peta Murgatroyd. The two struggled to make their height difference work as they foxtrotted to \"Feeling Good.\" The awkward and somewhat stiff performance earned them a meager 11/30.\n\nPoints earned during the DWTS two-hour season premiere will carry over to next Monday's show, during which audience members will cast votes for their favorite dancers. Next Monday's show will also mark the first elimination.\n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" returns Monday, Sept. 23 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nHere are the current standings:", "description": "The 28th season of", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/james-abc-er-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
