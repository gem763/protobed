(Steven Senne/AP)\n\nNew England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick is contractually obligated to take questions from the opposing team\u2019s media each week via conference call. Over the past two decades, the often-terse six-time Super Bowl champion has become quite adept at avoiding topics he doesn\u2019t want to talk about and making inferior opponents sound as if they\u2019re on the cusp of becoming the NFL\u2019s next great dynasty.\n\nOn Tuesday, ahead of undefeated New England\u2019s visit to FedEx Field, the winless Washington Redskins were the latest recipient of Belichick\u2019s praise. He laid it on thick.\n\n[Five bright spots on a humiliatingly bad Redskins team]\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all pretty good,\u201d Belichick said of quarterbacks Colt McCoy, Case Keenum and Dwayne Haskins, one of whom will start against New England\u2019s top-ranked defense. \u201cObviously, McCoy is an outstanding player with a great deal of experience, and so is Case. Those guys have played a lot of football, they\u2019ve played a lot of good football, and they have a very talented group of skill players with them. Haskins is a young, talented player. \u2026 We\u2019ll have to be ready for all three players, and that\u2019s going to be a big challenge for us.\u201d\n\nBelichick said McCoy and Keenum are \u201cvery efficient at getting the ball into the hands of very good skill players\u201d \u2014 which is true, in Keenum\u2019s case, if one includes the hands of the opposing team\u2019s defensive backs.\n\nThe Redskins have \u201cgreat skill players at every spot,\u201d according to Belichick, who somehow neglected to mention punter Tress Way when rattling off his list of examples. (Belichick was on the phone, not at a dais addressing a room of reporters in person, so it\u2019s impossible to say for sure whether he was stifling a laugh or his usual stoic self at this point.)\n\n\u201c[Adrian] Peterson and [Chris] Thompson, [Vernon] Davis, [Jeremy] Sprinkle\u2019s been playing more,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cAdd [Terry] McLaurin to that group. [Trey] Quinn, [Paul] Richardson. They\u2019ve got a very good group of skill players, and they get them out a lot in the West Coast passing game. It\u2019s up to the quarterback to make good decisions to get the ball to those players, to those open players, and let them advance it with their run-after-catch skills.\u201d\n\nWashington is missing two starters along the offensive line \u2014 three if you count holdout left tackle Trent Williams \u2014 and tight end Jordan Reed, the team\u2019s best skill position player, has been out all season with a concussion. While Thompson leads the league in yards after catch, the Redskins rank 28th in total offense, and their 199 rushing yards are their fewest in their first four games of a season since at least 1940.\n\nBelichick also was complimentary of Redskins Coach Jay Gruden\u2019s \u201cvery well-designed and thought-out offensive scheme\u201d and Washington\u2019s \u201cwell-balanced offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes you defend everything; the running game, the play-action game, the quick throws, the screens and the vertical passing game, where they\u2019ve hit a number of big plays and had other guys open that just didn\u2019t connect,\u201d he said.\n\nKeenum has missed a few wide-open receivers, including Quinn on two plays in the first half against the Giants that contributed to his benching, but the \u201cnumber of\u201d big plays Washington has hit is a small one. The Redskins are tied for 21st in the league with 11 passing plays of at least 20 yards. Their two passing plays of at least 40 yards, both of which came in a Week 1 loss to the Eagles, are tied for 16th. Washington scored three points against the league\u2019s 31st-ranked defense last week.\n\n[From 2015: Bill Belichick praises Kirk Cousins -- but it's a trap!]\n\nBelichick similarly talked up the Dolphins\u2019 personnel ahead of New England\u2019s trip to Miami in Week 2.\n\n\u201cThey have a lot of good players, a lot of good skill players, a lot of good players on defense,\u201d Belichick said on a conference call with Dolphins reporters, two days after Miami\u2019s 59-10 season-opening loss to the Baltimore Ravens. \u201cThey\u2019re young, they\u2019re aggressive, they\u2019re talented and we\u2019re going to have to contend with all of them and the scheme that they come up with. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have things that we\u2019re not working on and we\u2019ll have to be ready to handle those.\u201d\n\nThe Patriots managed to overcome Miami\u2019s abundance of talent to eke out a hard-fought, 43-0 win.\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nAhead of Patriots game, Jay Gruden faces a familiar choice: Keenum, Haskins or McCoy?\n\n\u2018Coaching malpractice\u2019: Analysts rip Jay Gruden for playing Dwayne Haskins against Giants\n\nJenkins: This wasn\u2019t about Jones vs. Haskins.
