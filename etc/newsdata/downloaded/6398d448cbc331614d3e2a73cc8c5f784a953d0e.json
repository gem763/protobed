I refuse to sugarcoat it.\n\nYou are going to hate yourself because you are going to be spending an inordinate amount of time obsessing over your fantasy football team. You will be studying with an intensity you never achieved back in school, to the point that you will know more about the backup running back situation for the Seahawks than you do about your own children. You may not know what\u2019s going on with Brexit, or what movies are in the theater, but you are going to have a very strong opinion about the Tampa Bay Buccaneers kicker.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What is your strategy when friends and family start talking about their fantasy football teams? Join the conversation below.\n\nI get it: It\u2019s important. But if you are not careful, you will become the type of person nobody wants to talk to at parties, unless, of course, you encounter another fantasy football player at the party, who also has a strong opinion about the Tampa Bay Buccaneers kicker, and then the two of you will politely be asked by the host to go to the store and buy more ice\u2014a store that\u2019s 70 miles away\u2014even though the party seems to have plenty of ice.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, despite all this obsessiveness, you are going to lose. A lot. You are going to lose fantasy games to people you like, people you hate and at least a few shirkers who have never watched a football game and let a computer algorithm do all the work. You may even lose to a dog\u2014and perhaps even a shirker dog who let a computer algorithm do all the work.\n\nIf you play fantasy, it is entirely possible that, by late October, you will not be able to watch football on TV anymore, because all this fictional losing has made you so furious. I read somewhere that 340% of all people who play fantasy football wind up screaming expletives into a garbage barrel at least twice a season. Almost 910% of people who play fantasy will, at some point, tell everyone they know they will never play fantasy again, and a solid 400% of fantasy players wind up selling off their belongings and moving to Newfoundland, never to look at an NFL score again.\n\n\u201c I read somewhere that 340% of all people who play fantasy football wind up screaming expletives into a garbage barrel at least twice a season. \u201d\n\nI know this data sounds inflated, but trust me: It\u2019s real.\n\nIf you do not play fantasy football\u2014and it is important to remember there are still a few dozen Americans who do not\u2014remember that there are helpful strategies for coping. I have played fantasy football, but it is my strong belief that there is no activity worse than listening to other people yammer on about their fantasy teams. I would rather argue about politics with strangers on a crowded airplane. I would rather ask recently divorced people about their divorces. I would rather hear about a kayak vacation you took five years ago. Even the kayak vacation you took 20 years ago, where you lost a hat.\n\nIn fact, if you have enough space on your property, I\u2019d suggest building a small wooden shed outdoors\u2014nothing fancy\u2014and calling it the \u201cFantasy Shed.\u201d There, any loved one who really loves fantasy football can go sit and talk to themselves for hours upon hours, about what they should have done with their fantasy team, how they blundered in the draft, what trades they want to make and what their hopes are for the playoffs. I think all you need in a Fantasy Shed is a lawn chair, a hot plate and maybe an AM radio. I would not let the cat go into the shed. The cat doesn\u2019t want to hear about fantasy football, either, especially if the dog\u2019s winning.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work: Newfoundland.\n\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com", "description": "It\u2019s wildly popular and inspires fanatical devotion.
