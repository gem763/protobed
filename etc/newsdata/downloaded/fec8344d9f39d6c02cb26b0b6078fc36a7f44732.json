And it's so common that it's happened to the majority of us.\n\nPexels\n\nSo what is paper clipping?\n\nWe've all been on dates with people who aren't super amazing but aren't super bad also. It's like they'll do when we literally have no one, not even a back-up option. (Yes, we have all thought about this for someone). They seem super interested too and speak about hanging out or chilling again too.\n\nThen after giving you an ounce of hope- they ghost. But that's ghosting. Paper clipping requires an extra step.\n\nSo once you have forgotten about this mediocre person and moved on with your life, you suddenly see a text from them for no rhyme or reason. Something like, \"hey you!\" or \"hey, how's it going?\"\n\nFamiliar? Congratulations, you have successfully been paper clipped!?\n\nSamantha Rothenberg, an illustrator from New York, rose to fame after her Instagram post that details exactly what paper clipping is went viral. The Instagram post that now has over 16,000 likes and counting and a couple hundred comments where people are saying, \u201cOH MY GOD YAAASS EVERY GUY/GIRL EVER\u201d thank god, tleast this wasn't just happening to us.\n\nAnd the worst part about paper clipping is how the person isn't into you and doesn't even care much but just wants you available as a back-up option.\n\nPexels\n\nSo now that we know this is happening to a lot of people, let's try to put an end to this.\n\nIf you are someone who's guilty of paper clipping someone, please stop. You deserve to be with somebody you love/like, don't settle yourself and don't give false hope to others. We need this insensitivity to end.\n\nAnd if you know of someone who is paper clipping you, send them this link. It'll put some much deserved sense in their head.", "description": "You know ghosting and breadcrumbing. Now, meet paperclipping.
