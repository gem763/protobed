It's available to preorder on Tuesday and will be widely available on October 24.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nWith the countless leaks in the past few weeks, you might have thought Google had already announced its new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL flagship smartphones, but the company made the phones official and filled in all the missing details at its big \"Made by Google\" event on Tuesday.\n\nCombined with Google's own teasers, the incessant leaks, which ranged from high-resolution photos to full video reviews from Vietnamese tech YouTubers, left very little room for surprises.\n\nRegardless, there's nothing like fully confirmed and official details, so here's everything you need to know about Google's Pixel 4 smartphones.\n\nThe Pixel 4 phones have a design that harks back to the Pixel 2, with a large top bezel \"forehead.\" That forehead is where Google is storing its \"Soli\" advanced radar-based facial-recognition tech that can scan your face faster than any other phone, Google said.\n\nThe Soli sensors can also be used for motion-gesture controls for a limited number of apps, at least for now. So far, supported controls include skipping songs, snoozing alarms, and silencing phone calls by waving your hands.\n\nThe Pixel 4 phones have smooth and fluid 90Hz screens. On other phones with those screens, like the OnePlus 7-series smartphones, it gives the impression that the phone is faster and more powerful.\n\nThe Pixel 4 phones have a dual-lens camera system: one lens for regular photos, and another for zoomed photos.\n\nGoogle made plenty of improvements to its Pixel cameras with the new live HDR plus, \"learning\" white balance, and wider range for portrait modes, and it made further improvements to the already incredible Night Sight mode.\n\nGoogle Assistant got a \"clean, new interface,\" Google said, and looks sleeker and more integrated with the phone \u2014 like it's part of the Pixel 4 rather than a separate entity.\n\nThe Pixel 4 starts at $799, and the Pixel 4 XL starts at $899. The device will come in three colors: black, white, or a limited-edition bright orange. It's available to preorder on Tuesday and will be widely available on October 24.", "description": "The Pixel 4 might be the most leaked smartphone in history, but nothing beats official and confirmed details.
