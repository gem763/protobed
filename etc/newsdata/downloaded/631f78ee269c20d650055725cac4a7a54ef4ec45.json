Now in El Camino \u2013 the movie follow-up to hit antihero drama Breaking Bad \u2013 he gets a chance to wrap up his story. He\u2019s back, but the story\u2019s moved on, his catchphrase now notable by its absence.\n\nEl Camino begins where Breaking Bad ended. Pinkman (Aaron Paul) has been liberated from the hellish prison in which he had been confined by neo-Nazis, forced to cook industrial-grade crystal meth. The man doing the liberating was Walter White, Pinkman\u2019s mentor\u2013turned\u2013nemesis and chemistry teacher\u2013turned\u2013drug kingpin. White is dead now though, killed during the rescue mission. Pinkman meanwhile is speeding away in a muscle car (the 1978 Chevrolet El Camino), heading, creator Vince Gilligan previously claimed, to \u2018something better\u2019.\n\nExcept, it turns out, he isn\u2019t. The first scene shows Pinkman putting his foot on the floor, lowering his gaze as the police pass by en route to the crime scene. From there, he goes to the home of his friends Badger and Skinny Pete, where he eats noodles and falls asleep. After a brief reunion in which his friends go above and beyond to help him out \u2013 \u201cdude, you\u2019re my hero and shit\u201d, says Skinny Pete \u2013 he drives off again, but only to another block in Albuquerque, his home town, and another moment of tension.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Meth kingpins of Albuquerque ...

El Camino (Spanish for \u201croad\u201d or \u201cway\u201d) is not the story of a man skipping town. Rather it\u2019s about someone who is trapped \u2013 not just in New Mexico, but in his head, bound by the trauma he has just experienced and the memories that help him, finally, to work out where to go next.\n\nThere has been much speculation among Breaking Bad enthusiasts \u2013 of which there are many \u2013 over which characters from the original show would return here. The answer is several, including big hitters, even though most of them are dead. El Camino cuts continuously between the 48 hours that follow Jesse\u2019s escape, and a number of flashbacks, some from his time in captivity and some from earlier than that. Most of the cameos should come as a surprise, but it doesn\u2019t feel like spoiling things too much to note that there is a standout turn from Jesse Plemons as Todd, a child-like sociopath who plays good captor to Jesse during his time in the cage.\n\nThe film follows an interesting structure, and one that contradicts the impression given by some of the pre-release marketing. Gilligan \u2013 who reprises his own role as writer and director \u2013 has always been good at keeping his audience on their toes. His penchant for bravura cinematography is on display once again, with one time-lapse sequence featuring eight Jesses creeping around a house proving a standout moment. But while it has both style and content, El Camino feels more like a feature-length TV episode than an actual movie. It is too compact and fragmented to truly stand on its own, and viewers who have not seen the preceding 62 hours of Breaking Bad will likely struggle to enjoy it. That El Camino is a Netflix production \u2013 set to be released on the streaming giant today with only a smattering of cinema screenings (and none in the UK) \u2013 might explain this construction.\n\nHowever, where it excels is in giving the character of Jesse some closure. Paul told the Guardian this week that Breaking Bad \u201cchanged my life\u201d. It won him three Emmys for a start and, like a meth kingpin who had successfully hidden his money in the desert, it likely set him up for life. But it\u2019s also true that Paul has since struggled to find a role that allowed him to put Pinkman behind him. It\u2019s the project he continues to be best known for \u2013 a privilege but also a tether. Here, he is allowed to move on and leave both the clowning criminal \u2013 and the haunted victim \u2013 of the series behind.\n\nEl Camino shows Pinkman become an adult, someone dressed not in bright yellow hoodies but cable knit jumpers. He achieves this metamorphosis gradually, through unlocking the various challenges that are laid in his path. Some of them are technical \u2013 like the great magnet\u2013inspired conceits of the TV series \u2013 but others are emotional, even moral. The path of El Camino is not a literal one \u2013 and it\u2019s completed without a single \u2018bitch\u2019.", "description": "Picking up right where the hit drama left off, Netflix\u2019s follow-up film shows Jesse Pinkman\u2019s next move ... though it\u2019s not the thriller you may have hoped for", "authors": ["Paul Macinnes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caaf4286a5d7475819d45abdcf987a238bef920b/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=46a98be862f6a7256008b403bd9ede15", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
