Support for independence is surging due to Brexit\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visits the trade stands during the SNP autumn conference in Aberdeen, Scotland, Britain October 14, 2019.

But among Remain voters, support for independence has increased from by 5 points to 56%. When Scots were asked how they would vote following a no-deal Brexit, the number of voters who would back independence rose by 4 points to 54%, a healthy lead for the Yes campaign which might reasonably be expected to rise once voters had experienced the predicted economic damage of such an outcome.\n\nIt means warnings in 2016 that Brexit could break up the union are coming to pass.\n\nNicola Sturgeon's imminent request for an independence referendum is likely to be rejected, but if support among voters in Scotland continues to grow, a future Westminster government of any shade will find the clamour hard to ignore.\n\n2. An independence referendum next year would be very risky\n\nFirst Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon on stage during the SNP autumn conference in Aberdeen, Scotland, Britain October 13, 2019. REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\n\nIt remains possible that Scotland will win an independence referendum next year, perhaps if Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was returned with a minority government and sought to enter into a coalition with the SNP.\n\nBut it is far from clear that a \"Yes\" vote for independence would prevail in such circumstances.\n\nWhy? For a start, a Labour-led government would hold an EU referendum which could see the UK vote to Remain in the EU. That would threaten to reverse the surge in support for independence since 2016 which appears to have been driven largely by Brexit.\n\nAnd even if the UK did vote to leave the EU after a referendum, support for Yes is only on 50%. By definition, that means 50% of voters still wish to Remain in the union. Support for \"Yes\" increased significantly during the 2014 independence referendum campaign, while support for Leave increased significantly from the start of the 2016 EU referendum campaign, proving that pre-emptive polling is of limited use in predicting any outcome.\n\nThat is the impossible bind in which Sturgeon finds herself: Brexit, a policy she bitterly opposes, may be necessary to deliver independence, the prize she most desperately seeks.\n\n3. The SNP's demand for an election could backfire\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visits the trade stands during the SNP autumn conference in Aberdeen, Scotland, Britain October 14, 2019. REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\n\nAs with the Conservative and Labour conferences this year, the SNP conference took place in the shadow of an imminent general election which many MPs believe will happen this year \u2014 and which the SNP is vocally in favour of.\n\nUnlike the fortunes of those two parties, whose fortunes in a snap election are very unclear, the SNP's dominance in Westminster's Scotland seats is relatively assured.\n\nPolls of Westminster voting intention suggest that the SNP will increase its vote share in Scotland slightly, which could see the SNP win around 50 seats, allowing the party to retain its status as the third-largest in Westminster.\n\nHowever, a snap general election could prove fatal to the SNP's hopes of independence. The polls currently indicate that such a vote could hand the Conservative party a slim majority, which is currently paralysed with a working majority of minus 45.\n\nA Boris Johnson-led government which had narrowly won an election on a manifesto which pledged to block Scottish independence would have little incentive to grant one. Furthermore, many Tory MPs who supported Remain are still chastened by the experience of voting in favour of a referendum which could lead to an outcome they bitterly oppose.\n\nThat means a snap election could prevent the prospect of a Scottish independence vote for at least another five years.", "description": "The SNP's demand for a snap election could backfire, and other things we learned at the SNP's annual conference in Aberdeen.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5c841cc4a0a2c986166a4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
