In the other distinguishable compartment, the animals got no booze.\n\nAfter getting them used to spending time in each room, the mice were set free to roam from room to room of the enclosure.\n\nUnsurprisingly, they remembered the room that offered all the free drinks, and tended to spend more time in it.\n\nThat is, until the researchers put a cap on the levels of the ACCS2 protein in the parts of their brains responsible for learning and memory formation.\n\nWith less ACCS2, the mice didn't care which room - the sober house or the bar - they spent time in.\n\n'This indicates to us that that alcohol-related memory formation requires ACSS2,' said Dr Gabor Egervari said, one of the study's co-authors.\n\n'Our molecular and behavioral data, when taken together, establish ACSS2 as a possible intervention target in alcohol use disorder - in which memory of alcohol-associated environmental cues is a primary driver of craving and relapse even after protracted periods of abstinence.'\n\nSenior study author, Dr Shelley Berger, said: 'It was a huge surprise to us that metabolized alcohol is directly used by the body to add chemicals called acetyl groups to the proteins that package DNA, called histones.'\n\n'To our knowledge, this data provides the first empirical evidence indicating that a portion of acetate derived from alcohol metabolism directly influences epigenetic regulation in the brain.'", "description": "University of Pennsylvania researchers discovered that alcohol triggers a process key to spatial memory and learning.
