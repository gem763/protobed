The bestselling story of a once-powerful Soviet revolutionary, who is arrested and tried for treason by the regime he helped establish, was deemed \u201ca piece of brilliant literature\u201d by George Orwell. Today it is regarded as one of the works that alerted the west to the realities of Stalin\u2019s regime and is one of the most celebrated political novels of the 20th century.\n\nNow, almost 80 years later, the Hungarian-British author\u2019s original text is being published in English for the first time after a German student discovered a carbon copy that had been lost since 1940.\n\nKoestler was an active member of the Communist party until he resigned, disillusioned, at the time of Stalin\u2019s purges in 1938. \u201cBrilliant as this book is as a novel, and a piece of prison literature,\u201d Orwell wrote of Darkness at Noon in a 1941 review for the New Statesman, \u201cit is probably most valuable as an interpretation of the Moscow \u2018confessions\u2019 by someone with an inner knowledge of totalitarian methods.\u201d\n\nBut the original manuscript, written while Koestler was in the south of France in the summer of 1939 and finished in Paris in 1940, has been lost for decades. The only known copy was the English translation made by the author\u2019s girlfriend, the British sculptor Daphne Hardy. A 21-year-old art student at the time, Hardy had no prior experience of translation, but on finishing the work she sent the English version to publisher Jonathan Cape in London, with Koestler posting his carbon copy in German to a publisher in Switzerland. The pair fled Paris days later when German troops arrived, with Hardy\u2019s translation believed to have been the only copy to survive.\n\nFour years ago, German graduate student Matthias Wessel found Koestler\u2019s original German carbon copy from 1940 in the archive of Emil Oprecht, founder of the Europa publishing house in Zurich. The name on the title page was Rubaschow, the German spelling of Koestler\u2019s protagonist, Rubashov; the author\u2019s name given as A Koestler. Every page had been stamped by the French censor\u2019s office, showing it had been sent from wartime Paris. A new English translation by Philip Boehm has now been published by Vintage, based on the rediscovered original.\n\nVintage senior editor Charlotte Knight said they were very proud to publish it. \u201cThis book is a stone cold 20th-century classic but if ever there was a moment to read it, or reread it, it\u2019s now,\u201d she said. \u201cDarkness at Noon is a dystopia of the first order. Grounded in reality, the Soviet-style dictatorship depicted by Koestler is as twisted, illogical and terrifying as any science fiction.\u201d\n\nBoehm called Rubashov \u201cone of the 20th century\u2019s great literary inventions: a hero of his time, whose fatal flaw is embedded in his very humanity. And how many of us allow ideology to confound judgment, vision to cloud sight, and personal conviction to overrule compassion. What a privilege to be able bring him back to life in translation.\u201d\n\nKoestler biographer Michael Scammell says in his introduction that while Hardy\u2019s translation is \u201clively and fluent\u201d despite lack of experience, it also reveals signs of the difficulties she had encountered.\n\n\u201cShe had been forced by circumstances to work in haste, with no dictionaries or other resources available for consultation, which exposed her understandable lack of familiarity with the Soviet and Nazi machinery of totalitarianism,\u201d Scammell writes. Forced to improvise, she sometimes made mistakes such as using \u201chearing\u201d for the German \u201cinterrogation\u201d, which Scammell said \u201cmade these regimes look somewhat softer and more civilised than they really were\u201d.\n\nHer version of Koestler\u2019s text was \u201cnot quite final either\u201d, with the Zurich manuscript showing \u201cchanges that Koestler made at the last minute and passages not found in the Hardy translation (such as a paragraph on masturbation in prison), items that Hardy couldn\u2019t possibly have known about or foreseen\u201d.\n\nScammell writes that Boehm\u2019s translation turns Koestler\u2019s novel into \u201ca crisper read\u201d than before. \u201cThe prose is tighter, the dialogue clearer, the tone more ironic, and the intricacies of Marxist-Leninist dialectics more digestible \u2026 The effect for the reader is of chancing upon a familiar painting that has had layers of varnish and dust removed to reveal images and colours in a much brighter light.\u201d", "description": "Arthur Koestler\u2019s classic story of Stalinist purges has hitherto been known through an incomplete translation by his girlfriend \u2013 until a student found the original in an archive", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f805167270ebc5e52ea12a6538c1f2eedd72eb9/0_535_1605_963/master/1605.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=72b138013a536fc99de5a92494fc2163", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
