Marsden announced that his company was chosen to serve as the engineering, procurement and construction contractor at a $6bn petrochemical construction project planned in nearby Belmont county, Ohio, pending a final investment decision by Thailand-based PTT Global, expected later this year.\n\nDon't trust the courts to fight monopolies.

Even if not considered an invitation to collude, remarks like Marsden\u2019s could be relevant later, if evidence emerged that, say, wages offered on petrochemical construction projects are very similar, which could suggest employers reached a tacit agreement on rates, she said.\n\nConstruction jobs generally pay better in the Pittsburgh region than the rest of the US. In the spring of 2018, construction wages overall in Pittsburgh were roughly 5% higher than the national average, according to an analysis released this June by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while wages overall in the Pittsburgh area ran 4% lower than the rest of the country.\n\nConstruction industry analyst Jeff Burd, founder of the Tall Timber Group, said that non-residential construction wages in the region had gone up with the arrival of the Shell plant, but at a rate that just kept up with inflation. \u201cNon-union workers have probably seen a higher increase in wages but their share has been shrinking as the unions have organized more firms to meet the shortfall in skilled workers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat has increased is the amount of hours worked and premium pay.\u201d\n\nIndustry reports suggest Bechtel and PTT struggled to agree on a budget for the project earlier this year, with some observers citing labor rates as an issue. Bechtel declined to comment to the Guardian on its business discussions with customers.\n\nBechtel\u2019s chairman and CEO, Brendan Bechtel, was among roughly 200 corporate leaders who signed a highly touted 19 August statement from the Business Roundtable on corporate social responsibility, including a commitment to \u201ccompensating [employees] fairly and providing important benefits\u201d.", "description": "Exclusive: As US job market tightens Bechtel senior vice-president appeared to urge companies not to compete on salaries, arousing \u2018real wage-fixing concerns\u2019", "authors": ["Sharon Kelly In Philadelphia"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848869a56fb88e8b7b3d01c34ca1b71cb895d1a1/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2ae0ec16497445595eadf789ed726258", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
