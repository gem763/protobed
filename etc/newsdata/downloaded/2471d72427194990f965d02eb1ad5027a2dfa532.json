Kumgang,\" ministry spokesman Lee Sang-min told a briefing on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nTOURS SUSPENDED\n\nThe tours to Mt Kumgang were launched in 1998 with the investment of South Korean firms such as Hyundai Asan Corp and Ananti Inc, providing a rare source of cash for Pyongyang worth millions of dollars a year.\n\nThe program was suspended in 2008 after a North Korean soldier shot dead a South Korean tourist who had wandered unknowingly into a military area.\n\nHyundai Asan said in a brief statement it was perturbed by the KCNA report, but it would \"respond in a calm manner\" to developments.\n\nShares of Hyundai Elevator <017800.KS>, the majority shareholder of unlisted Hyundai Asan, fell 7.5%, while shares in Ananti <025980.KQ>, which owns a golf and spa resort in Mt Kumgang, were down over 8%.\n\nKim and South Korea's President Moon Jae-in agreed at a summit last year to restart the joint economic initiatives \"as soon as the environment is created\".\n\nTourism is not directly subject to U.N. sanctions, though international sanctions aimed at curbing the North's nuclear programs ban the transfer of bulk cash to Pyongyang. It has increasingly become an industry central to Kim's policy of \"self-reliant\" economic growth.\n\nBut inter-Korean relations have grown frosty since then, amid lackluster progress on denuclearization talks between the North and the United States, in which the South offered to play a mediator role.\n\nThe North has stepped up criticism against the South in recent months for adopting high-tech weapons and continuing military drills with the United States.\n\n\"Kim is trying to remove the South's traces and renovate Mt. Kumgang as he braces for the extended impact of sanctions and strained inter-Korean ties and seeks to draw Chinese tourists,\" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at South Korea's Sejong Institute.\n\n\"Any thaw in inter-Korean relations seems far-fetched even if they restarted talking to discuss the Mt. Kumgang issue.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has touted the North's tourism potential, saying in April that he would give \"great support\" for the resumption of tours to Mt. Kumgang when the time was \"right.\"\n\nSouth Korea-funded facilities remaining there have only used been during infrequent inter-Korean events, such as reunions of families separated by the Korean War, last held in August 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee and Hyonhee Shin; additional reporting by Ju-min Park and Sangmi Cha; Editing Lincoln Feast and Alex Richardson)", "description": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said South Korea's \"backward\" and \"shabby\" facilities at the North's Mt Kumgang resort must be removed and rebuilt in a modern way, state media reported on Wednesday, in the latest sign of cooling relations between the neighbors.
