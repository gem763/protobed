But for the few fortunate ones among us, they aren\u2019t super enough without a few extortionately priced optional extras.\n\nThe folk over at Leasing Options have identified some of the most ludicrous offerings whilst highlighting what you could buy with that kind of money.\n\n\n\n1. Bugatti Veyron Carbon Finish = \u00a3250 000\n\nThe first and most expensive car add-on is perhaps unsurprisingly from Bugatti, who offered their Veyron in a \u2018Carbon Finish\u2019 for a mind-blowing \u00a3250 000.\n\nThe average price for a house in the UK is \u00a3230 000. The Carbon Finish price is also the equivalent of 35 First-class flight tickets from London to Los Angeles.\n\n2. Bentley Bentayga Breitling Clock = \u00a3132 000\n\nAs an optional extra on Bentley\u2019s Bentayga, you can fit the clock of all car clocks. For \u00a3132 000 your new Bentayga will arrive with a very large and grand Breitling clock in the centre console.\n\nFor that price, you could hire a team of three people and pay them over the average wage of \u00a335 000 just to keep the time for you.\n\n3. Porsche 918 Spyder Liquid Metal Paint = \u00a352 000\n\nIf standard paint isn\u2019t enough for your 918 Spyder, Porsche also used to offer the option for it to be covered in what\u2019s known as \u2018Liquid Metal\u2019 paint for the staggering price of \u00a352 000.\n\nAlternatively, you could opt for another type of liquid, as \u00a352 000 would have instead bought you exactly 16 000 pints of beer.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Mercedes-Maybach Granite Interior = \u00a349 500\n\nAs if the interior in a Mercedes-Maybach wasn\u2019t fancy enough, now, for close to \u00a350 000, you can line the interior in granite.\n\nYou could spend nearly five years in an average London flat for this price.\n\n5. Rolls Royce Phantom Rear Seat Divider = \u00a328 500\n\nIf your Rolls Royce is to be driven in rather than driving it yourself, you may want to look into investing in the rear seat compartment divider.\n\nAnd, let\u2019s be honest, if you are being driven around in a Rolls Royce Phantom, the price tag of \u00a328 500 probably won\u2019t be much of an issue. However, for the average Joe this would put your child through a three-year university course, or 11 full weeks at Disney World.\n\n\n\n\n\nView the original article here", "description": "For the average Joe, owning a supercar is what dreams are made of.
