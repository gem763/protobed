To lure him away from the stove, I piled up parsley for him to chop or cheese for him to grate at the other end of the kitchen island. Or I\u2019d set out a bowl of chips and salsa across the room. Soon I\u2019d done it: no more Scott hovering around me while I cooked.\n\nI followed the students to SeaWorld San Diego, where a dolphin trainer introduced me to least reinforcing syndrome (L.R.S.). When a dolphin does something wrong, the trainer doesn\u2019t respond in any way. He stands still for a few beats, careful not to look at the dolphin, and then returns to work. The idea is that any response, positive or negative, fuels a behavior. If a behavior provokes no response, it typically dies away.\n\nIn the margins of my notes I wrote, \u201cTry on Scott!\u201d\n\nIt was only a matter of time before he was again tearing around the house searching for his keys, at which point I said nothing and kept at what I was doing. It took a lot of discipline to maintain my calm, but results were immediate and stunning. His temper fell far shy of its usual pitch and then waned like a fast-moving storm. I felt as if I should throw him a mackerel.\n\nNow he\u2019s at it again; I hear him banging a closet door shut, rustling through papers on a chest in the front hall and thumping upstairs. At the sink, I hold steady. Then, sure enough, all goes quiet. A moment later, he walks into the kitchen, keys in hand, and says calmly, \u201cFound them.\u201d\n\nWithout turning, I call out, \u201cGreat, see you later.\u201d\n\nOff he goes with our much-calmed pup.\n\nAfter two years of exotic animal training, my marriage is far smoother, my husband much easier to love. I used to take his faults personally; his dirty clothes on the floor were an affront, a symbol of how he didn\u2019t care enough about me. But thinking of my husband as an exotic species gave me the distance I needed to consider our differences more objectively.\n\nI adopted the trainers\u2019 motto: \u201cIt\u2019s never the animal\u2019s fault.\u201d When my training attempts failed, I didn\u2019t blame Scott. Rather, I brainstormed new strategies, thought up more incompatible behaviors and used smaller approximations. I dissected my own behavior, considered how my actions might inadvertently fuel his. I also accepted that some behaviors were too entrenched, too instinctive to train away. You can\u2019t stop a badger from digging, and you can\u2019t stop my husband from losing his wallet and keys.", "description": "In this popular essay from June 2006 \u2014 one of the most emailed Times articles ever \u2014 a wife tries to improve her husband by using exotic-animal training techniques.", "authors": ["Amy Sutherland"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2006/06/23/style/25love_ready/25love_ready-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
