And the odds are on his side, as no Korean runner has broken the 2 hours and 12 minutes barrier since 2011.\n\nIt was the Kenyan-born marathoner's first official race since becoming a Korean citizen last year. His Korean name is Oh Joo-han.\n\n", "description": "Naturalized Marathoner to Represent Korea at Tokyo Olympics", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/22/2019102200642_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
