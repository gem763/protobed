REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea\u2019s Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon is expected to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe next Thursday in what would be the highest-level talks between the two countries since Tokyo imposed export curbs in a deepening trade and diplomatic spat, Seoul officials said on Friday.\n\nLee is scheduled to visit Tokyo for Oct. 22-24 to attend Japanese Emperor Naruhito\u2019s enthronement ceremony on behalf of President Moon Jae-in.\n\nBoth sides are trying to finalize a meeting between Lee and Abe on Oct. 24 following a banquet hosted by Abe the day before, Lee\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nRelations between the neighbors are arguably at their lowest ebb since they normalized ties in 1965, after South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court last year ordered two Japanese companies to compensate some wartime laborers. Tensions flared between the two following the ruling.\n\nLee said in an interview with Japan\u2019s Asahi newspaper released on Friday that he might deliver a letter from Moon expressing his willingness to work together to resolve disagreement over the forced labor issue.\n\nAn official at Moon\u2019s office said he and Lee had discussed the idea, but a decision on it had not yet been taken.\n\n\u201cOur fundamental position is that politics and economic issues should be handled separately and we hope to foster forward-looking relations and resolve problems through dialogue,\u201d the official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the ties.\n\nJapan says the wartime labor issue was settled under the 1965 treaty that normalized ties.\n\nThe dispute has since spilled over into trade and security, with Japan slapping export curbs and South Korea scrapping a bilateral intelligence-sharing pact.", "description": "South Korea's Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon is expected to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe next Thursday in what would be the highest-level talks between the two countries since Tokyo imposed export curbs in a deepening trade and diplomatic spat, Seoul officials said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442214987&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0NS", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
