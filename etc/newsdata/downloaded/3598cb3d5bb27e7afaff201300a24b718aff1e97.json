Photo: Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter failing to win enough seats to form a coalition government with his traditional allies in this week\u2019s election, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been forced into an unfamiliar state: desperation.\n\nOn Thursday, the long-serving Prime Minister floated the idea of a unity government consisting of him and Benny Gantz, who heads the rival Blue and White Party, sharing power. But Gantz quickly rejected that idea, and did not seem interested in meeting with Netanyahu to discuss the matter.\n\nNetanyahu said on Twitter that he was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d at Gantz\u2019s decision not to sit down with him, though he couldn\u2019t have actually been taken aback: On the campaign trail, Gantz had ruled out a unity government with anyone under indictment, by which he obviously meant Netanyahu. And Netanyahu himself had dismissed talk of a unity government leading up to the election.\n\nWith 97 percent of Tuesday\u2019s vote tallied as of Thursday evening in Israel, Gantz\u2019s Blue and White Party had picked up 33 seats to 31 seats for Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party. If those results hold, Blue and White would be given the chance by Israel\u2019s president to form a government first. But with 120 seats total in the Knesset, the party would need to partner with smaller blocs to make up a 60-plus seat majority \u2014 and there is no clear path for it, nor for Likud, to do so. Gantz, who has campaigned as a more ethical and secular alternative to Netanyahu, is anathema to the ultrareligious parties that have partnered with Netanyahu in recent years, while Netanyahu is radioactive to most of those on his left.\n\nAs New York contributor Jonah Shepp explained on Wednesday, the kingmaker here is likely to be Avigdor Lieberman, the onetime Netanyahu ally whose secular-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu won the handful of seats either side would need for a majority. Lieberman\u2019s refusal to join in a coalition with the prime minister after an election in April is what prompted this week\u2019s do-over; now, Lieberman is poised to foil his adversary once again. But it\u2019s unclear whether Lieberman will join Gantz\u2019s side either, which makes predicting the resolution of the current muddle difficult. There is the possibility of yet another election on the horizon, and a small chance that Netanyahu could dangle enough of Lieberman\u2019s hardline demands to form a coalition after all. But it is increasingly difficult to imagine how Netanyahu, for all his formidable political skill, will keep his grip on power after such a major setback.\n\nNetanyahu isn\u2019t just feeling the heat from an electoral perspective; his life may well be upended if he leaves office. He faces multiple allegations of corruption and fraud, with a pre-indictment hearing looming in October. The only way he could have plausibly avoided those charges, at least for the time being, was to win the election.\n\nAs he tries to negotiate his way out of political and personal crisis, Netanyahu has opted not to travel to New York for next week\u2019s U.N. General Assembly. If he had decided to come, it\u2019s unclear what sort of reception he would have received from the U.S. government; President Trump, his longtime friend and ally, gave him the rhetorical cold shoulder on Wednesday, telling reporters that he hadn\u2019t spoken with Netanyahu, and that \u201cour relations are with Israel.\u201d\n\nIt was another indignity for a man who is so used to winning that he may have forgotten what losing feels like.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
