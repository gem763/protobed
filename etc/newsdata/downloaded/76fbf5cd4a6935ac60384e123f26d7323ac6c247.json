CCS is \"absolutely essential'' if the world is going to meet the Paris goals. Arsineh Houspian\n\nThe days when petroleum and coal companies were the only proponents of CCS are gone. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the scientific body trusted to provide the world with information and advice about mitigating global warming, found CCS would be required in three of the four ''pathways'' it outlined for how the world can limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees.\n\nProfessor Julia King, the vice-chair of the agency that advises the British government on its five-yearly carbon budgets, believes CCS is \"absolutely essential'' if the world is going to meet the Paris goals.\n\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation, the environment group that has fought Adani's Carmichael coal project with a series of lawsuits, acknowledges that CCS may be needed for industrial sectors such as steel and cement, even though the foundation remains dark on the idea of CCS for coal-fired power.\n\n''There are two ways of looking at CCS. You can look at CCS as a means of prolonging the life of fossil fuel industries by investing further in sequestering carbon pollution. Or you can look at CCS as a means of capturing carbon from the atmosphere to help draw down the excessive carbon dioxide that has already been emitted,'' says the foundation's Suzanne Harter.\n\n\"For industries that do not have a choice, yes I think we should continue research and where possible trialling forms of sequestration.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLumped together as \"heavy industry'', the world's steel, cement and chemical plants produce about 30 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSo long as humble limestone (otherwise known as calcium carbonate) remains the basic feedstock for a large chunk of the world's cement, huge amounts of carbon dioxide will be emitted, regardless of what type of energy is used in the manufacturing process.\n\n''When a cement plant heats that up \u2026 all of that carbon dioxide in the rock comes out,'' says Hodgson, whose tower in Belgium shelters a 34-metre vertical steel tube at the heart of Calix's technology.\n\nFor every tonne of carbon dioxide that could be produced out of the rock itself, we have measured about 95 per cent capture. \u2014 Phil Hodgson, Calix\n\nThe tube is heated to 1000 degrees, and when a preliminary form of cement ''meal'' is poured down it, the carbon dioxide escapes and floats to the tube's top.\n\n''You can then separate and take that carbon dioxide as a pure stream,'' Hodgson says.\n\n''For every tonne of carbon dioxide that could be produced out of the rock itself, we have measured about 95 per cent capture.''\n\nHodgson's tower is now treating 5 per cent of the cement produced at Lixhe by Heidelberg Cement and the plan is to demonstrate consistent operations for another year before building a full-scale model to test commercial viability.\n\nEuropean carbon prices rallied from less than \u20ac5 ($8.20) in mid-2017 to more than \u20ac29 in July, and were above \u20ac26 on the day Hodgson spoke to The Australian Financial Review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe reckons Calix is in the game at such prices.\n\nPhil Hodgson ... the plan is to demonstrate consistent operations for another year before building a full-scale model to test commercial viability. Alf Mertens\n\n\"With carbon prices above \u20ac25 per tonne, I think we have a very attractive technology,\" he says.\n\n''The heat required [for Calix' technology] should not be any higher than the heat already required by the cement plant, so from an operational cost perspective we should be no higher than a current cement plant.\n\n''The only cost is the capital cost of building our facility.''\n\nThe coking coal challenge\n\nWhile Calix could deliver a win for corporate Australia on the global stage, much more is at stake for the local economy in the race to reduce the carbon intensity of the Asian steel sector, which is tipped to buy $37.2 billion worth of Australian coking coal this financial year.\n\nLike the limestone in cement plants, coking coal is an integral ingredient \u2013 not a fuel source \u2013 in most Asian steel mills, meaning the emissions created are \"hard to shift\".\n\nWhile there is a steel plant in Abu Dhabi that uses CCS, that plant does not use coking coal. Nowhere in the world is CCS attached to a steel mill that consumes coking coal.\n\nThe world's biggest exporter of coking coal, BHP, is keen to change that through work with Beijing's Peking University and steel mills in China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this stage the work is focused on better understanding the barriers to deployment in China, and is not expected to build any hardware at a steel plant any time soon.\n\nBHP's practice lead for climate change, Graham Winkelman, is confident CCS for Chinese steel mills is technically feasible, even though it has not been proven.\n\n\u201cThe predominant source of carbon dioxide in a steel plant is the blast furnace and that has similarities to a point source of emissions within a power plant, but we have yet to see that demonstrated at full-scale,\u201d he says.\n\nWinkelman\u2019s comment highlights the bridge that connects those working in the uncontroversial world of CCS for heavy industry, to those working deep in the culture war that still surrounds CCS for coal-fired power. If CCS is to work in the steel sector, it will probably need to borrow the lessons learned in attempts to retro-fit CCS onto coal-fired power stations.\n\nThat puts the spotlight squarely on two power stations in North America: Canada's Boundary Dam station and the WA Parish Power Station in Texas.\n\nThe North American experience\n\nBetter known as the Petra Nova carbon capture project, the Texas plant is the most realistic attempt at retro-fitting a coal-fired power station with CCS in a financially transparent way.\n\nPetra Nova's owner, NRG Energy, does not publish the CCS project's financial results as a line item in its accounts, but it discloses enough to make clear Petra Nova has not been a financial success in the 34 months it has been operating.\n\nThe Petra Nova business model is built on two revenue streams: selling coal-fired power and selling oil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnit 8 of the power station has a generation capacity of 610 megawatts, and the capture facility treats 40 per cent of the gas that comes out the flue, or chimney, when Unit 8 is operating at full capacity.\n\nNRG says almost 3.2 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide has been captured by Petra Nova between December 2016 and September 2019.\n\nAfter being captured, the carbon dioxide is piped 129 kilometres to the ''West Ranch'' oil field, where it is injected underground to boost oil extraction rates. The oil is then sold by NRG and its joint venture partner JX Nippon.\n\nBoundary Dam's business model also relies on using the captured carbon dioxide to boost oil extraction, although it sells its carbon dioxide to Toronto-listed Whitecap Resources.\n\nDespite having the twin revenue streams \u2013 electricity and oil \u2013 the evidence suggests neither Petra Nova nor Boundary Dam have been profitable.\n\nLow oil prices over the past five years have been a big part of the problem.\n\nPetra Nova has shown that a CCUS plant can be built on time and on budget and that carbon capture technology does work. \u2014 David Knox, NRG spokesman\n\nFormer NRG chief David Crane said in 2015 that carbon capture at Petra Nova for use in oilfields made economic sense when oil prices were higher than $US75 ($110) per barrel. North America's benchmark oil product, West Texas Intermediate crude, has averaged $US55 per barrel since then.\n\nNRG took a $US140 million impairment on Petra Nova in 2016 and a further $US69 million impairment in 2017.\n\n''Petra Nova economics are impacted by many things including oil price, oilfield production, operating costs and project debt,'' NRG spokesman David Knox tells the Financial Review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother sign of Petra Nova's financial challenges came in August, when NRG confirmed it would have to repay up to $US124 million of debt to Petra Nova's lenders, because the project had fallen short of debt covenants.\n\nTellingly, NRG has no plans to retrofit its other coal-fired power units with CCS (NRG prefers the term CCUS to reflect the \"utilisation\" of the captured carbon in oilfields) but says Petra Nova has been an important step in proving the technical and commercial viability of carbon capture.\n\n''Petra Nova has shown that a CCUS plant can be built on time and on budget and that carbon capture technology does work and can capture greater than 90 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the processed flue gas from a coal plant at commercial scale,'' Knox says.\n\nThe notion that a business model for CCS can be built on the production of another fossil fuel, such as oil, does not sit easily with Britain's Professor King.\n\n'Against the whole purpose'\n\nShe is not convinced by attempts to rebrand CCS as ''CCUS'', saying the commercial \"uses\" for captured carbon were unlikely to match supply.\n\n''In terms of the scale of carbon dioxide that we are going to need to capture, we are not going to find very many ways to use that. There will be some, putting some into greenhouses and using some in chemical reactions, but actually most of it is going to need to be stored, so I think the letter 'U' in 'CCUS' is slightly decorative.\n\n''And I certainly feel that if the 'U' is enhanced oil and gas recovery, that is slightly against the whole purpose of doing this carbon capture and storage in the first place.\"\n\nThe International Energy Agency reported in 2015 that for every tonne of carbon dioxide injected into a producing oilfield, 0.63 tonnes of carbon dioxide abatement was delivered even after the resulting oil production was burned.\n\nSouth Australian oil and gas producer Santos is investigating whether injection of carbon dioxide into its flagship Cooper Basin fields can improve oil extraction rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile its first three years have been financially challenging, Petra Nova's best days may yet be ahead thanks to beefed-up financial incentives signed into law by US President Donald Trump in February 2018.\n\n'A big splash'\n\nKnown as the 45Q legislation, the changes will give tax credits of up to $US35 for each tonne of carbon dioxide injected into the earth by new projects that capture carbon dioxide then use it to boost oil recoveries. Those capturing and storing the carbon for no productive use will be eligible for tax credits up to $US50 per tonne.\n\n''That is a big splash,'' said Page. ''It is by far the one [policy initiative] I can observe that has led directly to investment.''\n\nThe 45Q legislation is also expected to boost existing CCS projects like Petra Nova.\n\n''While Petra Nova does qualify for 45Q, the rules around 45Q are still being formulated and we cannot predict specifically what they will mean for Petra Nova,'' says Knox.\n\nCheap gas was the main reason the $C1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) retro-fitting of CCS to unit 3 at Saskatchewan's Boundary Dam coal-fired power station was not a financial success.\n\nCorwyn Bruce used to work as CCS initiatives manager for the provincial government utility that owns Boundary Dam: Saskpower.\n\nBruce says when CCS was approved for Boundary Dam in 2010, the cost of power from the retro-fit was roughly equivalent to building a new gas-fired power station.\n\n''Since that time in Canada, the price of natural gas has dropped significantly, which challenges the business case of wider deployment of CCS retrofits of coal-generating assets,'' he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaskpower has since abandoned plans to retro-fit CCS onto two further units at Boundary Dam, but the utility has not given up on CCS altogether.\n\nA joint venture between Saskpower and BHP has published a feasibility study on the cost of retro-fitting CCS onto the Shand power station, one of Saskpower's youngest coal-fired power stations which is double the size of Boundary Dam.\n\nThe study found that 90 per cent of the plant's carbon emission could be captured at a cost of $US45 per tonne, assuming the retrofitted plant could run for 30 years.\n\nThe study estimated the capital costs of construction could be 67 per cent lower than the Boundary Dam retrofit. If Shand were to run at 62 per cent of its generation capacity, the study estimated carbon dioxide capture rates could reach 97 per cent.\n\nEven if we were to build several of these things we are not going to build enough of them to drive down the cost. \u2014 Tony Wood, Grattan Institute\n\nBruce says the biggest cost reductions would come from Shand's bigger scale, but a range of lessons from Boundary Dam's experience would deliver cost reductions.\n\n''The Boundary Dam CCS facility was a first in the world plant. When pioneering a commercial scale plant, equipment is often designed larger than it needs to be in order to mitigate the risks of the unknown and then, inevitably with operational experience, improvements to the plant design are recognised,'' he says. ''The second generation study takes advantage of these learnings.''\n\nLike Petra Nova, it is possible that Boundary Dam's most lucrative days lie ahead. The Canadian government has legislated to shut down its coal-fired generators by 2030, but exclusions are being negotiated for power stations fitted with CCS, and that could mean Boundary Dam unit 3 is one of the few coal-fired generators operating beyond 2030.\n\nThe Australian experience\n\nThe Grattan Institute's energy guru, Tony Wood, doesn't doubt that second- and third-generation CCS for coal-fired power can be cheaper than the pioneering efforts at Boundary Dam and Petra Nova.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he doubts that CCS costs could fall as precipitously as renewable energy infrastructure costs have fallen over the past decade, given there are only 16 coal-fired generators in Australia's National Electricity Market.\n\n''Even if we were to build several of these things, we are not going to build enough of them to drive down the cost. It is not like manufacturing solar panels,\" he says.\n\nWood is no greenhorn on CCS, having studied the technology and its potential deployment in Victoria's La Trobe Valley in partnership with former US president Bill Clinton's eponymous not-for-profit foundation. ''Having spent five years of my life, working 70 per cent of the time on CCS around the world, including speaking to the best technology people I could find, yes, you could bring down the cost if you had to do it, but I have not seen anything that is yet anywhere near compelling,\" he says.\n\nThe cost of attaching CCS to coal-fired power in Australia will differ for each individual power station depending on its age, efficiency and proximity to geologically appropriate storage sites.\n\nA lack of suitable storage sites near Lake Macquarie in NSW has convinced Delta Energy chairman Trevor St Baker that CCS is not realistic for his company's Vales Point coal-fired power station. ''I don't think it has any capacity at Vales Point. Vales Point is nowhere near anything you can sequester it in,'' he says.\n\nAll I know is that alternatives like Snowy Hydro are [also] hugely expensive. \u2014 Trevor St Baker, Delta Energy chairman\n\nSt Baker says the Bass Strait fields from which BHP and ExxonMobil have been extracting oil and gas for the past 50 years loom as the perfect carbon sink, particularly given their proximity to the La Trobe Valley's coal-fired power stations.\n\nThe Surat Basin, a large area straddling the border of NSW and Queensland on the western side of the Great Dividing Range, has also been identified as a geologically suitable area for sequestration. Its suitability is bolstered by the fact it hosts significant coal-fired power and coal seam gas extraction businesses.\n\nA Glencore subsidiary, CTSCO, is planning to trial storage of carbon dioxide in the Surat Basin near Wandoan, with the project likely to take about 5 per cent of the carbon dioxide produced by the Millmerran power station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe venture is not designed to be profitable in the forseeable future. Supporters say its value will lie in being a local CCS demonstration plant that Australians can see and touch, and the project may also create shared infrastructure (such as wells) that could make future CCS projects more economically viable.\n\nChallenged to boil down the cost of CCS for coal-fired power in Australia to a single number, St Baker says he can't.\n\n\"It would be very significant. All I know is that alternatives like Snowy Hydro are [also] hugely expensive,'' he says.\n\nThe coal industry member organisation now known as Coal21 hired consultants in 2017 to crystallise the costs of retrofitting Australian coal plants for CCS. They settled, with a bunch of caveats, on about $99 for each tonne of carbon dioxide abated.\n\nFor context, futures prices for the supply of electricity to Victoria in November 2019 were fetching $103.38 per megawatt hour on October 15.\n\nAnalysis conducted by WorleyParsons subsidiary Advisian in 2017 found that it would cost more than $100 per tonne of carbon dioxide avoided to attach CCS to existing coal-fired power stations in Australia.\n\n'Bordering on the implausible'\n\nCoal21 is expected to publish a study later this year on building a new 700-megawatt ultra supercritical coal-fired power station with CCS in the Surat Basin at a capital cost of between $2.5 billion and $4 billion. The study is expected to suggest power could be produced from such a plant at a cost of $95 per megawatt hour, with 90 per cent of the carbon dioxide captured.\n\nIt appears more likely that CCS in the power industry will be applied where there is growth in energy demand. \u2014 Graham Winkelman, BHP's practice lead for climate change\n\nCoal21 is confident such a power station could produce electricity for $70 per megawatt hour \u2013 the price nominated as desirable by federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor \u2013 if carbon capture rates were lowered to 45 per cent. However, the full assumptions behind the study are not yet available for scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony Wood finds the numbers hard to believe.\n\n''Producing the electricity from the latest high-efficiency coal-fired power station might be in that [price] territory, but to capture and sequester the carbon dioxide as well? It is difficult to see how it would come together financially in Australia.\n\n''The things that would have to happen for it to be realised [in a commercially viable way] are bordering on implausible.\"\n\nDelta Electricity chief executive Greg Everett said in June that he did not think a high-efficiency, low emissions (HELE) power station would fit with the Morrison government's goal of reducing power prices to about $70 per megawatt by 2021.\n\n\"Our assessment of HELE is it is about $90 to $100 per megawatt hour.\"\n\nBHP's Winkelman says CCS has a role to play in industrial settings, but will need to compete against renewables if it is to penetrate the power sector.\n\n\u201cIt appears more likely that CCS in the power industry will be applied where there is growth in energy demand because growing systems typically need \u2018more of everything\u2019.\"\n\nThat last comment speaks volumes when you appreciate that electricity consumption in Australia fell 7 per cent in the decade to June 30, 2019, according to statistics published by the Australian Energy Regulator.\n\nStepping on the gas\n\nAttaching CCS to Australia's LNG export industry, which is largely responsible for Australia's rising emissions profile, looks far cheaper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2017 Advisian study found that attaching CCS to gas processing in Australia would cost $26.90 per tonne of carbon dioxide avoided. The lower cost is due to the fact gas processing already separates the carbon dioxide from the saleable methane before chilling gas into liquid form for export. That means much of the hard work is already done.\n\nDavid Byers, chief executive of Co2CRC. Penny Bradfield\n\nThat cost advantage may explain why more than half of the 18 large-scale CCS facilities in commercial operation around the world in 2018 were attached to natural gas processing.\n\nChevron is in the process of joining that list, after one of the three carbon capture facilities at its Gorgon LNG plant in Western Australia started to inject carbon dioxide deep below Barrow Island in August 2019. CCS at Gorgon is running a long way behind schedule, but assuming the other capture units eventually come into operation, Gorgon will be the world's biggest CCS project.\n\nStep change reduction in costs\n\nIn the peaceful dairy country of south-western Victoria, scientists from universities such as Stanford, Cambridge, Texas, Melbourne and Perth's Curtin University are working on a project to deliver a \"step change\" reduction in the cost of monitoring sequestered carbon dioxide.\n\nPartly funded by big companies like Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, BHP, Woodside and Total, the third phase of the Co2CRC Otway project is hoping to prove that fibre optics can be used to accurately monitor the migration of stored carbon dioxide through porous rock over long periods of time.\n\n''About 40 per cent to 60 per cent of the total cost of the storage is captured in that long-term [seismic] monitoring, so we figure we can save up to 75 per cent off those long-term monitoring costs,'' says David Byers, the chief executive of Co2CRC. ''That is a step change in the way we look at the whole task of long-term monitoring of carbon dioxide.\"\n\nByers says there is plenty the federal government could be doing to make CCS more viable in Australia.\n\nPolicy parity\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile he would love a local version of Donald Trump's 45Q incentives, Byers says there are less ambitious policies that could boost the sector, such as reforming the Morrison government's $2 billion Climate Solutions Fund to ensure that geological storage of carbon was eligible for Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs).\n\n''Under the current set-up, there are many opportunities to gain ACCUs for biological sequestration through reforestation, or revegetation, but there really isn't any approved methodology which would accommodate carbon capture and storage,\" he says.\n\n''Geological storage is more trustworthy [than biological storage] because you have much greater certainty and scientific veracity attached to monitoring of carbon dioxide, and where it is located in a geological storage structure.\n\n\"We need to have policy parity with other low-emissions technologies.''\n\nIt is a view enthusiastically supported by Santos, while Winkelman indicates BHP is also sympathetic to the idea.\n\n\u201cIf methodologies such as biosequestration or geosequestration can effectively store carbon dioxide, it seems appropriate that carbon credits could be generated to encourage their use and development,\u201d Winkelman says.\n\nAsked whether he believes geological storage of carbon should be eligible for ACCUs, minister Taylor says: ''The government is committed to ensuring the Climate Solution Fund supports low cost abatement across the economy, including uptake of new technology.''\n\nHarter says the Australian Conservation Foundation will not support ACCUs for CCS.\n\n''Government policy on reducing carbon pollution should not be about throwing a lifeline to coal, oil and gas, it should focus on transitioning to clean zero-pollution options,\" she says. \"There is a finite budget on the table for Australian Carbon Credit Units. Paying Santos or other companies with fossil fuel interests to try to sequester their pollution is not a good use of that public money.''\n\nByers from Co2CRC and Santos also call for the government's Clean Energy Finance Corporation to be allowed to lend to CCS projects, a suggestion that Harter says the conservation foundation will \"absolutely\" not support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next big thing\n\nNo discussion of CCS is complete without mentioning hydrogen, which governments hope can play a big role in decarbonising the world's economy.\n\nWhile many nations see hydrogen as the low-carbon replacement for natural gas in domestic uses such as heating, it is also being spruiked as a transport fuel, and even a potential substitute for coking coal in steel making.\n\nThere are two primary ways to produce hydrogen. Electricity can be used to separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water, and if that electricity is supplied by renewables, you have what many call \"green hydrogen\". The alternative method is using high-temperature steam to reform methane; a process that creates carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide byproducts.\n\nPeople have to be creative and they also have to put aside their prejudices. \u2014 Peter Cook, University of Melbourne scientist\n\nKing says Britain will need to do plenty of both, and neither will be cheap. ''There is an awful lot where we can't use electricity where we are probably going to need hydrogen,\" she says. ''Quite a lot of that hydrogen is going to need CCS.''\n\nPage says in Australia it is cheaper to produce hydrogen from fossil fuels and use CCS to store the carbon byproducts, rather than use renewables to make hydrogen via electrolysis.\n\nJapanese heavyweights such as Marubeni and Kawasaki Heavy Industries are working with AGL on such a hydrogen plan in the La Trobe Valley, which if expanded would store carbon emissions in Bass Strait's Pelican field.\n\n'A role to play'\n\nHaving watched CCS drift in and out of fashion with policymakers and big business over recent decades, scientist Peter Cook says it is time for acceptance and collective action.\n\n''People are now coming to a view that CCS has a role to play. People have to be creative and they also have to put aside their prejudices. We are all in this together, and it is pretty foolish to think any one technology has all the answers.''", "description": "A fragile consensus is growing across industry, governments and the environment movement that carbon capture and storage is essential for meeting climate goals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2981%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_788%2C$y_294/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d552006a7a9a1575b042caa7374b50b230e3a734", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
