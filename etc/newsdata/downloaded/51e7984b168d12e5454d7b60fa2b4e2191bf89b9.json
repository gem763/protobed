Both the Irish government and Apple have appealed the order, with CEO Tim Cook dubbing it \"total political crap.\"\n\nRepresentatives from Apple, Ireland and the EU appeared in front of the EU General Court in Luxembourg on Tuesday in the latest legal proceeding. Apple's six-person delegation was led by CFO Luca Maestri, according to Reuters. Last year, the EU court denied U.S. officials' request to intervene in the tax challenge.\n\nThe hearings in front are expected to last through Wednesday, but a decision likely won't be reached for months. The decision will likely be appealed to the EU's highest court, the Court of Justice.", "description": "Apple challenged a $14 billion tax charge from the European Commission in the EU's second-highest court on Tuesday, escalating the landmark tax fight between the iPhone maker and EU regulator.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Schulze"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105030628-GettyImages-857398838.jpg?v=1568710065", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
