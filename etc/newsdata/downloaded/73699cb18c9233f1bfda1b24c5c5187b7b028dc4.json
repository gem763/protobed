The Turkish president \"robbed factories, wheat and fuel and is today stealing territory\", he said in an apparent reference to Turkey's cross-border operations into Syria in the last few years.\n\nEarlier this month, Turkey began its third cross-border assault against the Syrian Kurdish fighters in Syria's northeast with the help of allied rebel forces, who control swaths of territory north of Idlib.\n\nWith Syria's civil war now in its eighth year, capturing the Idlib area would be an important victory for al-Assad, who has steadily recovered control of areas under rebel control with Russian and Iranian support.\n\n191021111450984\n\n\"We said and continue to say that the Idlib battle is the core to decisively end chaos and terrorism in all of Syria,\" al-Assad was quoted as saying.\n\nIdlib enjoyed a lull in air raids after Damascus and its ally Moscow declared a ceasefire on August 31 following five months of bombing - which the United Nations said killed hundreds of people.\n\nJust before the ceasefire, the Syrian offensive, aided by Iranian-backed fighters, made its most significant advance by seizing the strategic city of Khan Sheikhoun. The campaign also expanded state control of parts of a highway that stretches from the capital Damascus to the city of Aleppo.\n\nDe-escalation zone\n\nTurkey and Russia had brokered a de-escalation zone deal in 2017 to curb fighting in Idlib.\n\nAccording to the deal, Ankara promised that the rebels in control of the area, who Russia and Syria call \"terrorists,\" would lay down their arms and leave the area.\n\nDamascus and Moscow say this has not happened since the deal was struck.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people uprooted by the fighting in the northwest have fled towards the Turkish border.\n\nThe violence in Idlib province and a strip of nearby Hama has marked the biggest military escalation between al-Assad and his enemies since last summer.\n\n191022065737650\n\nTurkey has observation points inside Idlib, negotiated with Russia, to monitor a ceasefire there between the government and opposition fighters and rebel groups around the region.\n\nAssad's forces now control around 60 percent of the country and the president has repeatedly pledged to return all of it to his control, including Idlib.\n\nThe Syrian war has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions since it erupted in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.", "description": "Syria's president reiterated a pledge to retake all areas lost by his forces during the conflict, state media reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/22/2927ac0e3bb54b31a69aed48947511aa_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
