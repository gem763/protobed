Klobuchar has struggled to break through the sprawling 2020 Democratic presidential primary field, averaging just over 1 percent in national polling, according to RealClearPolitics' polling average. But in Iowa, Klobuchar got more optimistic results in a recent poll from Focus on Rural America, which found her at 8 percent.\n\nShe's placed a heavy emphasis on the state, leaning on her credentials as a fellow Midwesterner with a strong track record of winning votes in the rural parts of her state. Klobuchar has pledged to visit all 99 Iowa counties ahead of the state's caucuses on Feb. 3. She also started airing TV ads in Iowa and New Hampshire earlier this month, urging voters that if they \"feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you've got a home with me.\"\n\n\"Amy Klobuchar has always believed that leaders have a responsibility to reach out to voters wherever they are,\u201d Lauren Dillon, Klobuchar's Iowa state director, said in a statement. \u201cDuring her 'For All of America' bus tour, Senator Klobuchar will meet with caucus-goers from all backgrounds \u2014 in liberal, conservative and independent parts of Iowa \u2014 to make the case that she will be the president to bring our country together and focus on the issues that affect us all.\"", "description": "Amy Klobuchar is kicking off a three-day bus tour through Iowa following Tuesday's presidential debate in Ohio, according to a schedule shared with POLITICO.
