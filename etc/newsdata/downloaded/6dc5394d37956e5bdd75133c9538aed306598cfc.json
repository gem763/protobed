With the \u201cnew Google Assistant\u201d on the Pixel 4, issuing a command or query may become as simple as raising your phone and asking away.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a slew of rumours about the next-generation Assistant that came out this week courtesy of leaked internal Pixel 4 demo videos from 9to5 Google. Google previously teased the upgraded virtual assistant at its I/O event in May and has since detailed its new Motion Sense gesture controls, but this footage is our first look at the new Assistant in action.\n\nNot that launching Assistant is exactly difficult as it is; as with other voice assistants, saying \u201cHey Google\u201d will do the trick as will squeezing the sides of your phone beginning with 2017's Pixel 2 model. Call me lazy, but I\u2019m all about the convenience of picking up my phone and having the virtual assistant already open, especially since that step\u2019s necessary to trigger Google Assistant\u2019s new \u201cContinued Conversation\u201d feature. Similarly debuted at the company\u2019s I/O keynote, this makes operating the program sound more like a conversation and less like you\u2019re bossing some kind of tiny Google robot around (even though you still are, essentially).\n\nAccording to 9to5, Google\u2019s still working on this \u201craise to talk\u201d feature, so no word yet on whether it\u2019ll be available at launch. There\u2019s also been no official word concerning any of these demos from Google yet either; we\u2019ve reached out to them and will update this article with their response. Though it\u2019s hardly the first time news about the Pixel 4 has leaked ahead of its likely reveal next month.\n\nAs for Motion Sense, one of the videos 9to5 shared showed users answering their phone, switching music tracks, or turning off their alarm with a wave of their hand. All of which are features Google\u2019s already confirmed, which seems to give these demos a bit more credence than your run-of-the-mill internet rumours. The feature\u2019s powered by Project Soli, tech Google\u2019s been working on since 2015 that uses radar sensors to track nearby movement.\n\nOther demo videos highlighted how the new Google Assistant can control apps and remembers the context of messages so your replies go back to the right person even when you don\u2019t specify who. And the UI\u2019s a lot more colourful, which I think is cute.\n\nWhile all these Assistant upgrades might be nifty, they fail to sufficiently distract from one controversial feature Google\u2019s tacking on to the Pixel 4 to keep up with Apple: face unlocking. Well, less the feature itself and more how Google purportedly went about collecting data for its development: by taking advantage of vulnerable populations to harvest their face data for its database.", "description": "As the self-appointed \u201cfriend who looks everything up,\u201d I\u2019m open to any app or update that might make my constant fact-checking less of a production.
