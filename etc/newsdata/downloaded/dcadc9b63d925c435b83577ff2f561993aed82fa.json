The 36-year-old was initially listed in the starting lineup but was replaced again by Yan Gomes just under three hours before the first pitch.\n\nGomes will be behind the plate for Max Scherzer, the three-time Cy Young winner who was unable to make his start in Game 5 because of an irritated nerve near his neck. Scherzer is starting the finale after a cortisone shot.\n\nGomes was listed eighth, the same spot Suzuki was to bat.\n\n___\n\n5:20 p.m.\n\nAlex Bregman and Houston manager AJ Hinch spoke three times Tuesday night about the third baseman carrying his bat to first base after hitting a home run in the first inning.\n\nHinch said he talked to Bregman about it during the game, after the game at the stadium and on the phone after they both left the park following Houston\u2019s 7-2 loss to the Nationals in Game 6.\n\nBregman apologized for the move after the game and Hinch shared what he told him about it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not how we do things and not something that was necessary,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cIt was an emotional reaction. I love the way he plays and it doesn\u2019t diminish what he brings to the table, but it was unnecessary.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hinch knows that Bregman learned his lesson from the miscue and wants him to put it in the past.\n\n\u201cAfter the game and into the night I wanted to make sure he realized he\u2019s got to forgive himself before he moves on,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cWe need to make sure it doesn\u2019t ruin (Game 7). I don\u2019t want it to carry over.\u201d\n\n___\n\n5:00 p.m.\n\nHouston manager AJ Hinch said Game 6 starter Justin Verlander won\u2019t be available for Game 7 against the Washington Nationals.\n\nAfter taking the loss in Game 6 to fall to 0-6 in seven career World Series starts, Verlander said he would be available on Wednesday if Hinch needed him. But Hinch shut that down.\n\n\u201cAll hands on deck means most hands on deck,\u201d Hinch said.\n\nWhile Verlander is out while Houston tries to win a second championship in three seasons, fellow ace Gerrit Cole could be used out of the bullpen.\n\nCole got the win in Game 5 on Sunday. Hinch said he\u2019ll talk to him before the game about how he might use him on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt would be in a limited capacity if I ask him to do anything,\u201d Hinch said.\n\n___\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nNationals catcher Kurt Suzuki is back in Washington\u2019s lineup for the deciding Game 7 of the World Series against the Houston Astros.\n\nSuzuki hadn\u2019t played the last three games while dealing with a hip flexor strain. The 36-year-old, who homered in Game 2, will be behind the plate to catch for Max Scherzer.\n\nScherzer, the three-time Cy Young winner, was unable to make his start in Game 5 because of an irritated nerve near his neck. He is starting the finale after a cortisone shot.\n\nWashington\u2019s lineup was unchanged aside from Suzuki back in the lineup batting eighth, and center fielder Victor Robles dropping back to the No. 9 spot after catcher Yan Gomes hit in that spot in Game 6.\n\nHouston used a familiar lineup against the right-hander, led off by 2017 World Series MVP George Springer.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter", "description": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Game 7 of the World Series (all times local): 5:35 p.m. Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki has been scratched from Washington's", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/30/c88718_world-series-nationals-astros-baseball-86051-houston-astros-alex-bregman-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
