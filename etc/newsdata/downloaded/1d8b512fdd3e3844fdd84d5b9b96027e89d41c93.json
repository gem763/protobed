If he doesn\u2019t report by opening day, WPG loses his cap hit until he does report. \u2014@TSNBobMcKenzie Not nearly as ominous as it sounds. WPG still wants Byfuglien back but needs to protect roster and cap flexibility until they know his intentions. \u2014@TSNBobMcKenzie The paperwork has been filed but it can be reversed at any time and it\u2019s not something that would come as any surprise to Byfuglien. In the meantime, WPG waits while he ponders his future. \u2014@TSNBobMcKenzie\n\nByfuglien has been absent since camp opened on Sept. 13. He met with Jets coach Paul Maurice on Thursday.\n\nWATCH | Jets coach Paul Maurice discusses Byfuglien's leave:\n\nWhen asked about the retirement rumour, head coach Paul Maurice told reporters on Wednesday that he's respecting Byfuglien's privacy and won't comment on that or the reason for the leave of absence. 2:05\n\nGeneral manager Kevin Cheveldayoff was hopeful Friday that the club could work something out with Byfuglien.\n\n\"Dustin is a big part of our family here,\" Cheveldayoff told reporters. \"There's always an open policy for discussions. We always care about people of our family. One thing I will say, healthwise, everything is good for him and his family. But again, from our standpoint, we support Dustin and look forward to the resolution.\"\n\nByfuglien is scheduled to earn $8 million US this season in the fourth year of a five-year deal.\n\nByfuglien scored 31 points (four goals, 27 assists) in 42 games last season, his eighth in Winnipeg.
