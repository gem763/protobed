USA TODAY\n\n\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" left Rey, Finn, General Leia Organa and the rest of the scrappy, rag-tag Resistance with a win against the evil First Order but far, far away from having a legit army.\n\nThe highly anticipated movie \"The Rise of Skywalker\" (in theaters Dec. 20) promises major battles between good guys and bad, but before that the new novel \"Resistance Reborn (Del Rey Books, out Nov. 5) acts as an important bridge between films. It picks up immediately after \"Last Jedi.\" Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac in the movies) has been tasked to reunite with his Black Squadron, while Leia is aboard the Millennium Falcon trying desperately to reach their allies.\n\nWriting Leia \"was an honor and a gift,\" says author Rebecca Roanhorse, adding that the late Carrie Fisher's heroine \"was really my way into the 'Star Wars' universe. Her continued leadership and strength in the face of loss and grief was a great inspiration for understanding not only her character but Poe, Finn and Rey, as well.\n\n'Star Wars': 5 things that shook us in the final 'Rise of Skywalker' trailer\n\n'The Mandalorian': New 'trailer drops more hints about Disney+ 'Star Wars' series\n\n\"I remember the first time I wrote 'Leia said' or 'Leia laughed.' I definitely got a bit choked up. That\u2019s when this fantastic journey all became real.\"\n\nGeneral Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) had some differences of opinion in \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" but have to be on the same page leading into \"Rise of Skywalker.\" (Photo: INDUSTRIAL LIGHT & MAGIC/LUCASFILM)\n\nUSA TODAY has an exclusive excerpt from \"Resistance Reborn,\" featuring a pivotal scene that tests loyalties and leadership. \"Not everyone sees eye-to-eye on how best to rebuild the Resistance or who should lead, going forward,\" Roanhorse says. \"And at this stage, the Resistance is decimated. They need ships and supplies, yes, but mostly then need people, and even more, they need leaders.\"\n\nPoe is also still haunted by the fallout from his quasi-mutiny against Vice Admiral Holdo in \"Last Jedi,\" where his arrogance turned into subordination, which led to good people getting killed. At the beginning of the new book, \"Poe\u2019s confidence in his ability to lead and his own decision-making is in crisis,\" Roanhorse says. \"He\u2019s going to have to learn to trust his judgment again and come to term with the consequences of his actions. He also has to earn back the respect of those that he is asking to follow him. It\u2019s not an easy path back to leadership for Poe.\"\n\nThe cover of the new novel \"Star Wars: Resistance Reborn\" by Rebecca Roanhorse. (Photo: DEL REY BOOKS)\n\nOld-school \"Star Wars\" fans will enjoy a reappearance from Wedge Antilles, the X-wing pilot who flew alongside Luke Skywalker and others in the original trilogy. \"Reborn\" also features some new characters to the universe.\n\nTeza Nasz is an ex-Imperial-turned warlord who's \"smart and a bit snarky,\" Roanhorse says. \"She\u2019s a source of both irritation and amusement to her Resistance colleagues. She standoffish, slow to trust, and doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. But she\u2019s going to find someone worth protecting and something worth fighting for beyond herself.\"\n\nAnd Pacer Agoyo is the son of a former member of Phantom Squadron, Wedge\u2019s old flight crew. \"He\u2019s had a rough start in life which makes him outspoken and brash, the kind of pilot who wears his heart on his sleeve and a chip on his shoulder,\" Roanhorse adds. \"He\u2019s going to have to learn to be part of team.\"\n\nThe excerpt also teases the entrance of another one-time Phantom Squadron pilot, \"a veteran of too many battles to take easily to Poe\u2019s leadership after the disaster on the Raddus,\" Roanhorse says. \"He\u2019s someone Poe\u2019s going to have to prove himself to if he wants to be a true leader again.\"\n\nPoe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, left) takes on a leadership role alongside fellow heroes Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) in \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.\" (Photo: LUCASFILM)\n\nRead below (or listen) for an exclusive excerpt from \"Resistance Reborn\":\n\nPoe arrived at the fight just as one of the pilots Wedge had brought in from Phantom Squadron went sliding across the floor, his feet skidding out from under him in a streak of blood.\n\n\u201cWhat in the hell?\u201d Poe murmured, taking in the scene. To his left was the ex-Imperial, Teza Nasz. She was breathing hard, her chest rising and falling rapidly. She had a cut above one of her eyes that bled freely, streaking the ocher on her cheeks and dripping on the floor like rubies against the black stone. The woman surged forward, a pillar of muscle, but Jess Pava hurried to stop her. She wrapped a hand around the woman\u2019s arm, pulling her back, pleading in words that Poe couldn\u2019t hear this far away.\n\nTo his right, Wedge and another man were helping the Phantom Squadron pilot Poe didn\u2019t know up from the floor over his protests that he was fine and didn\u2019t need their help.\n\nThe gathered assembly had created a loose circle around the two combatants, clearly ready to cheer on the fight. Poe looked at their faces. They were a fair mix of rebel veterans - graybeards left over from the war with the Empire - and fresh faces that looked like they couldn\u2019t be long out of flight school, if they ever attended flight school at all. The absurdity of it all flashed through his mind. The old and the young, both caught up in this war, both fighting for the same things, yet somehow fighting each other. Might as well punch yourself in the face, he thought. That last thought stopped him in his tracks. Is that what Maz had been trying to tell him? That he was fighting himself?\n\n\u201cPoe Dameron,\u201d a familiar voice called. Poe shook the unsettling thought from his mind and looked over to see his old flight instructor, Wedge Antilles.\n\n\u201cAntilles,\u201d he said, voice threaded with anger. \u201cWhat in the hell is going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cAgoyo swung first,\u201d Norra Wexley offered. She was standing beside Wedge, clearly evaluating the ex-Imperial with something that looked like appreciation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I care,\u201d Poe said, somewhere between disgusted and tired. \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same side here. What is this about?\u201d He waved his hand in the general direction of the circle of bystanders.\n\n\u201cYou should care!\u201d shouted the young pilot Norra had named as Agoyo. He was back on his feet, but the uniform he wore was streaked with blood that wasn\u2019t his. That uniform wasn\u2019t his, either. Or at least it had belonged to someone else before Agoyo claimed it. For one, it was at least a size too big, but the giveaway was the Phantom Squadron patch. This kid was way too young to have been part of Phantom Squadron.\n\nPoe raised an eyebrow. \u201cIdentify yourself, pilot.\u201d He hated to call the young man out, but he also knew that he needed to put an end to whatever this was right now, before grudges formed and things got even more complicated.\n\nAgoyo tossed his black hair out of his eyes defiantly. He crossed thin arms over a square chest, and his expressive mouth twisted now in something close to contempt. Poe shook his head. Agoyo was this close to insubordination.\n\n\u201cName, pilot,\u201d he repeated crisply.\n\n\u201cPacer,\u201d the kid practically spit. \u201cPacer Agoyo.\u201d\n\n\u201cPacer.\u201d Poe gave him a nod of acknowledgment. \u201cYou know who I am?\u201d\n\nPacer nodded. \u201cPoe Dameron.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m your commanding officer,\u201d Poe corrected him. \u201cAnd frankly, right now I\u2019m not impressed with what I see. I understand you\u2019ve come a long way to join us . . .\u201d He left the statement open until Pacer offered: \u201cNuja. My dad flew with Phantom Squadron at Kashyyyk but he\u2019s dead. So I came instead.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Oscar Isaac says working on the final episode in the current \"Star Wars\" saga was \"the most fun it's been.\" (March 4) AP\n\nThat explained the uniform. \u201cI appreciate your father\u2019s service, and your willingness to join the Resistance, but unfortunately, it looks like you\u2019re not a good fit for this mission. You\u2019re free to leave.\u201d Poe very purposefully turned his back on the pilot. Small gasps of shock echoed around him, and then silence. He caught Leia\u2019s eye. She was standing back at the edge of the crowd, watching.\n\nPoe heard Pacer shifting in his boots. He cocked his head slightly to indicate he was waiting.\n\nFinally Pacer spoke. \u201cPoe . . . I mean, Commander Dameron. I-I want to stay, sir. Please. It\u2019s just . . .\u201d\n\nPoe could almost feel the emotion flowing off the young pilot like a living thing. The kid was deep into it, whatever it was. Not embarrassment, not regret . . . righteousness. Righteousness and rage.\n\nHe turned. \u201cIt\u2019s just what, Agoyo?\u201d\n\nPacer wasn\u2019t looking at him. He was focused on Teza Nasz. And his gaze burned hot, all that rage bubbling to the surface.\n\n\u201cDo you know each other?\u201d Poe asked, a suspicion forming in his mind.\n\n\u201cShe murdered my brother!\u201d Pacer growled. He took a step forward, fists rising.\n\n\u201cAgoyo!\u201d Poe barked sharply, drawing the young man\u2019s attention to himself.\n\nPacer froze.\n\n\u201cEyes on me,\u201d he said, and now their eyes met. \u201cYou will stop menacing Teza Nasz, or I will have you thrown in the brig until you can cool down. Is that understood?\u201d Poe wondered if they even had a brig, but certainly they could improvise, if necessary. He hoped it wouldn\u2019t be necessary.\n\nPacer Agoyo paled. Wedge, who had been standing near the young man and watching, placed a hand on Pacer\u2019s arm and leaned in to whisper in his ear. At first Poe thought Agoyo would shake him off, but instead some of the bubbling anger seemed to dissipate, and he let Wedge pull him back.\n\nPoe breathed a silent sigh of relief and made a note to speak to Wedge later. But first, he had to bring Teza Nasz on board, too.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Poe asked, turning to the ex-Imperial. He knew next to nothing about the woman, but he would have to figure her out quickly. He needed everyone\u2019s buy-in, or this wouldn\u2019t work. Simmering resentments, distrust, and personal grudges would kill this new Resistance just as quickly as an attack by the First Order.\n\nTeza turned a painted, blood-streaked face toward Poe. \u201cIt\u2019s possible I killed his brother,\u201d she admitted coolly, \u201cbut I don\u2019t remember.\u201d She straightened to her full height, easily just shy of two meters, her eyes roaming over the gathered crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that I killed all of your brothers. And cousins. And mothers and fathers and former lovers.\u201d Her voice was flat and unforgiving. \u201cIt was my job.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d Poe asked, voice calm, curious but not accusing.\n\nCLOSE 2019's holiday moviegoers get the chance to travel from a friendly neighborhood (hello, Mister Rogers!) to a galaxy far, far away. USA TODAY\n\nTeza focused back on Poe, looking mildly surprised. \u201cBecause it was wrong,\u201d she said simply. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know it at the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were young and ambitious,\u201d Poe said, taking a guess, \u201cso you joined the Empire.\u201d\n\nHis conjecture was rewarded with a startled nod. \u201cMostly hungry,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou joined the Empire,\u201d Poe said, eyes roving the room before resting on Wedge, \u201cjust like you.\u201d\n\nThe older man blinked but didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret I attended Skystrike Academy,\u201d he said, spreading his hands. \u201cBut I left once I realized what the Empire was doing.\u201d\n\nPoe gave him a knowing nod and turned to Zay. \u201cAnd your mother,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy mother was an Imperial officer,\u201d Zay said quietly. \u201cBut she defected. She and my father. They died for the Resistance. Ask Leia. She knows.\u201d\n\nCarrie Fisher as General Leia in \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d (Photo: Lucasfilm Ltd.)\n\n\u201cSuralinda?\u201d Poe called, raising his voice slightly. Suralinda was sitting on a bench watching the scene before her with glittering eyes, no doubt taking mental notes for another story. \u201cI didn\u2019t give a care about either side much,\u201d she admitted breezily. \u201cI was ready to sell Resistance secrets if it would get me what I wanted. Oh wait, I did.\u201d She laughed at the stunned faces around her. \u201cRelax,\u201d she said. \u201cI came around.\u201d\n\nPoe smiled tightly and tried not to think about yelling at her to choose her words with a bit more care, but she had made his point.\n\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d Poe asked, turning lastly to Finn, who had been idling in the background next to Rey.\n\nFinn stepped forward immediately. \u201cUsed to be a stormtrooper, but now I\u2019m rebel scum,\u201d he said, pressing a fist over his heart. \u201cUntil the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy point,\u201d Poe said, turning back to Agoyo, \u201cis that many of us have dubious beginnings, but it is how we end that counts.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father was Darth Vader,\u201d Leia said, pitching her voice so that it rang out clearly through the room. \u201cIs there anyone who wants to question my loyalty to the Resistance?\u201d\n\nCLOSE Forty years of \"Star Wars\" storytelling leads to the ninth episode \"The Rise of Skywalker,\" starring Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and John Boyega. USA TODAY\n\nThe room was wisely silent. Poe nodded his thanks, and she returned it before stepping back.\n\n\u201cNow, is there anyone else with a grudge that needs airing? Something that\u2019s bothering them? Someone in this room that they can\u2019t wait to knife once their back is turned?\u201d He got a few laughs at that, as he had meant to, and the tension lessened a bit. He waited a moment longer until it looked like no one was going to speak, started to pass the floor to Leia when a new voice called out from the crowd.\n\n\u201cI got a question.\u201d\n\nPoe bit his lip to keep himself from cursing. It was one of the old rebel pilots, someone Wedge had found from the original Phantom Squadron. He resembled a human, but his skin was a dusty gray and his pate was hairless, either by genetics or by design. Poe didn\u2019t know him, but he knew his type immediately. The way he stood, legs planted wide, shoulders squared from carrying that chip around. He was going to be a pain in the ass, but he also looked like someone the other pilots would follow. Poe had a feeling he needed him on their side, troublemaker or not.\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d he prompted.\n\nThe veteran pointed a finger at Poe. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard the stories,\u201d the man said. \u201cAbout what happened on the Raddus. To Holdo.\u201d The man thumped his chest. \u201cI fought with Holdo. She was a good leader.\u201d\n\nPoe felt queasy. Panic fluttered in his chest, and his hands felt clammy. Some small voice inside screamed that he was caught, that his worst nightmare was coming true. Part of him wanted to hide, to shrink back and let someone else handle it before he royally screwed it all up again, but Maz\u2019s admonition rang in his head. Was he a leader or not? Was all his talk about giving his blood, sweat, and tears to the survival of the Resistance just that? Or did he mean it?\n\nHe made himself breathe deeply and then exhale. He met the man\u2019s accusing gaze head-on.\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Poe said simply.\n\n\u201cYou agree?\u201d the veteran sneered. He propped massive hands on his hips. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard, Poe Dameron. That\u2019s not what any of us heard\u2026\u201d\n\nCLOSE 'The Mandalorian' trailer has finally been unleashed, heading for Disney+.
