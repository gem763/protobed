You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe voicemails the 29-year-old received have now been turned into the podcast, with the only form of editing being the alteration of the subjects' voices to safeguard their identities.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to speak on their behalf, I wanted to listen to them,\u201d Johnson wrote in the Instagram caption.\n\n\u201cTo protect anonymity the voices have been slightly pitched, and any identifiers have been removed. Other than that, they have not been edited.\n\n\u201cThese are real stories from real people around the world.\u201d\n\nJohnson explained that listening to the stories on the podcast \u201ccan feel very intense\u201d, urging any listeners to \u201ctake care\u201d of themselves if they choose to listen to them.\n\n\u201cIn this podcast, I want to create a space where the listener is listening just as honestly and bravely as the speakers who had the courage to call,\u201d she said.\n\nJohnson also explained the thought process behind the name of the podcast, stating that the left ear is the closest to the heart.\n\n\u201cAnd by listening with your heart, you can save someone even just a little bit,\u201d the actor added.\n\nThe first episode of The Left Ear is available to listen to now, with subsequent episodes due to be released every Monday from 7 October.\n\nSeveral Instagram users praised Johnson over the creation of the podcast.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
