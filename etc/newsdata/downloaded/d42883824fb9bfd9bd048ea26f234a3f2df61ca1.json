Photographed outside Michael Kors, Brock Collection, Batsheva, and more, these stylish individuals opened up about how and why they dress the way they do. Scroll down to learn how their looks came together.\n\nAlex Badia, 42, style director, WWD\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Valentino jacket, Dries Van Noten shirt, old Bottega Veneta pants, and Calvin Klein tank top. 1970s porn star was my style inspiration today. My style philosophy: Have fun.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @thealexbadia\n\nAnnina Herzer, curator\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Pleats Please (top), Sies Marjan (bag), Gucci (shoes), and my skirt is from Taobao. The outfit matches with my mood and activities today. I get inspired by my travels and daily impressions from my work in the art world.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @heannina\n\nAlyssa Coscarelli, 25, fashion consultant\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cWhen I put on Brock Collection I feel like a woman. They make the most flattering dresses.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @alyssainthecity\n\nKalika Farmer, ageless, venture capitalist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Lemaire top and trench, Shaina Mote pants, Mansur Gavriel shoes, and my necklace was designed by my close friend Malu Byrne of En jewelry. I focus on supporting designers that reflect my own passion for sustainability and creativity. My philosophy is to support designers that care about our planet and I am weaning completely off of plastic. This is my version of a power suit. I\u2019m here representing one of my oldest and dearest friends, Batsheva Hay, who is also a Pisces like me. She\u2019s a beauty, a romantic, and a powerful poet who possesses brains (she\u2019s a licensed attorney) and a fabulous sense of humor. She believes in magic, always questions authority, and believes rules are made to be litigated.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @delphi.vc @new__age\n\nCassie Liu, 29, fashion editor, Marie Claire China\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a top from SINOON, I.AM.GIA pants, and Prada shoes.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @iamcassieliu\n\nSarah Brody, market and accessories director, Interview\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Balenciaga shirt and scarf with a Sacai skirt.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @its_brody\n\nTyler McCall, 33, editor-in-chief, Fashionista\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Kate Spade dress, Le Specs sunglasses, Jennifer Fisher earrings, Madewell sandals, and Chanel bag. A few years ago I realized I felt my most comfortable self in dresses and skirts, so I\u2019ve really been leaning into that. I thought about wearing heels today but it\u2019s the last day and I just couldn\u2019t bear it, so I went with sandals. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a whole \u2018vacation in Italy\u2019 vibe because it seemed like literally everyone was in Italy this summer but me! I\u2019m inspired by feminine power dressing; I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with being a little girly, even as I get older. I love women like Sarah Hoover and Stephanie LaCava who sort of subvert expectations through their style. I think it\u2019s important to stay true to who you are with your style and not chase trends. And, as my mother taught me, if you find something you love, buy it in every color. I\u2019m pretty much always thinking of Blair Waldorf when I get dressed.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @eiffeltyler\n\nKarina Avelar, 23, accessories assistant, Vogue\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a vintage dress from my great-aunt, a Zara sweater, & Other Stories T-shirt, New Balance sneakers, thrifted bag. I knew it was going to be a crazy day at work and I wanted to wear something cute and comfortable. I wasn\u2019t wearing the sweater originally but felt like the outfit looked too much like maternity-wear without it. My style is inspired by the people I interact with at work, random people on the street, old movies, and magazines. I usually pick one item I feel like wearing that day and go from there. My style philosophy: You can make anything work with a bit of creativity and the right styling.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @kar.av\n\nSne\u017eana Ani\u010di\u0107 van Pelt, 38, fashion designer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a thrifted top and skirt, bathing-suit top, Nike shoes, velveteen socks, and bag and hat bought on the street. I like thrifting and picking from the street random pieces. Lately I have been combining sporty clothes and basics. I go for things that feel easy to wear and work in.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @snezana.anicic.van.pelt\n\nMarion Lange, 52, executive producer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cMy jacket is Golden Goose, pants vintage, shoes Bottega Veneta, glasses vintage Silhouette. And the small bags are Bottega Veneta (pink) and Jacquemus (blue).\u201d\n\nInstagram: @marionyc\n\nBrenda Weischer, 26, journalist and stylist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cMy jacket is Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, my top is Helmut Lang, my skirt is Georgia Alice, bag is Prada, slides Jil Sander, sunglasses Miu Miu. Everything else is in my packed suitcase as I\u2019m flying today. My style philosophy: Comfort above all \u2014 I prefer being underdressed.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @brendahashtag\n\nMolly Rae, 24, studio manager\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing all vintage except my boots which are from Camper. I get inspired by colors and patterns \u2014 and my own closet! My style philosophy: red, yellow, orange, pink, green.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @lettherebeneon\n\nKaren Kaiser, 41, stylist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a shirt by Peter Do, trousers by Givenchy, shoes Nike x Sacai, bag and necklace vintage, and Celine sunglasses. I love an outfit with \u2018chic ease,\u2019 minimal fashion that is timeless with a modern twist, mixing in vintage as well for personal flavor, and finding special vintage denim and accessories that feel lived-in and traveled.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @kaisergrams", "description": "Liisa Jokinen shoots New Yorkers with fearless personal style at her site NYC-Looks.
