If I don't make a noise, no one will. I shall not fold my arms and keep quiet. I'll fight until the end.\"\n\nThe pain of losing his son in such a horrific manner was unfortunately not the only pain he lived through.\n\nSenzo was the breadwinner in his family, and looked after his parents and siblings, so much that he had started the process of building them a beautiful home, big enough to accommodate them and the rest of the family members who lived with his parents.\n\nRead more: Sam Meyiwa on Senzo\u2019s unfinished family home: \u2018It is in ruins\u2019\n\n\"He knew I was no longer comfortable living in the township because of the noise,\" Sam told DRUM.\n\n\"I guess that's one of the reasons he built that house.\"\n\nSenzo loved the area, Sam added.\n\n\"He knew we were getting old and he wanted us to age gracefully at Adams Mission. We live in a four-room house that's too small for all of us and Senzo wanted a place to accommodate everyone.\"\n\nBut after Senzo's murder, the half-built home stood as a painful reminder to Sam of how much his son loved his family but couldn\u2019t complete his dream of seeing them in the home he was building for them.\n\n\"Now all those dreams have been shattered. He will never see the final product of his work. We don't have money to finish the house. Sometimes I'm tempted to sell the whole structure and move on with my life. But I know I can't do that because I'd be defying my son's wishes,\" he said.\n\nMedia reports then suggested that the neighbours in the area where Senzo was building were complaining that the unfinished house had become a place where teenagers have sex, and a hideout for criminals, but Sam dismissed them, saying: \"There\u2019s no such thing as residents wanting the house demolished. I don't know where these rumours are coming from. If it was true, I would be the first one to know.\"\n\nWhen Senzo died, Premier Soccer League chairman Irvin Khoza made an announcement that Senzo\u2019s R4-million insurance had been paid out.\n\nHalf was due to Orlando Pirates and the other half to the Meyiwa family, as PSL players and officials are covered for injuries, and untimely death, in the insurance for the league.\n\nBut Sam said they hadn\u2019t received a cent of that money yet. Nor had Senzo's wife, Mandisa.\n\n\"I talk to Mandisa often,\" Sam said.\n\n\"She hasn't received the money. At least she's working and she\u2019s able to take care of her daughter.\"\n\nSam was so adamant about speaking out and seeking justice for his son, that he refused to be silenced by anyone, including songbird, Kelly Khumalo.\n\nHe alleged that the singer sent him a lawyer's letter, threatening to take legal action if he doesn't stop talking about her in interviews.\n\n\"I will not keep quiet because when I am quiet nothing happens. She also speaks about my son.\"\n\nDuring his last days Senzo's father's health deteriorated so much that he hardly spoke to the media anymore.\n\nAccording to the family spokesperson Nathi Ngwenya, he's happiest moment over the past five years was at the Senzo Meyiwa Commemoration Games held at King Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi.\n\n\"That was the happiest I had seen him,\" he told Move!.\n\nSenzo's killers have not yet been found even though Minister of Police Bheki Cele promised, during a live television interview at the beginning of 2019, that he would find Senzo\u2019s killers \"before Easter\".\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Sam Meyiwa died on Monday morning from a second stroke following his first one in August 2018.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9167/f1d78a23210d48d29eeeea7f33da0847.png", "published_at": "2019-07-29"}
