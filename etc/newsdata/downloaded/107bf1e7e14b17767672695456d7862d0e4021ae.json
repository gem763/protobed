Dominic Lorrimer\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s session of Senate Estimates, National Disability Insurance Agency acting chief executive Vicki Rundle fronted the Community Affairs Committee.\n\nLabor Senator Murray Watt spent nearly 15 minutes grilling the senior public servant on NDIA chairman Helen Nugent\u2019s use of Macquarie Group\u2019s corporate facilities \u2013 including the bank\u2019s email server \u2013 for NDIS business. Nugent is a former member of Macquarie\u2019s board and maintains her private office in its Martin Place headquarters.\n\n\u201cSometimes participants [or] people that she\u2019s met with might email her on her [Macquarie] email,\u201d Rundle acceded. \u201cI do think if people \u2026 in the community email Dr Nugent on her Macquarie email address, I don\u2019t see that that\u2019s at all unusual. I\u2019m trying to work out what the actual issue might be.\u201d\n\nWere it merely the case that NDIS participants had freely shared their information with the agency\u2019s chairman at her Macquarie address, there wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Sadly, that isn\u2019t the extent of Nugent\u2019s use of an external email system in the conduct of the agency\u2019s oversight.\n\nThough you wouldn\u2019t know it from Rundle\u2019s testimony. \u201cI would say in the majority, [Dr Nugent\u2019s] NDIS business is conducted through the NDIS email system,\u201d Rundle also impressed upon Watt. \u201cSenator, as I said, Dr Nugent\u2019s NDIS-related emails between the NDIS and her are conducted on NDIS email.\u201d And finally, \u201cThere has been no \u2026 breach of privacy to my knowledge.\u201d", "description": "Senator Murray Watt might ask for the paper trail, but it\u2019s probably sitting on a bank server.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2373%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_18/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/422b21f9d49037924890ce69787c995b9f83817d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
