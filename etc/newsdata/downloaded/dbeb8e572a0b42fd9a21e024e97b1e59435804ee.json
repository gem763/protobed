He was jailed on a related money-laundering charge after Hong Kong determined that it lacked the evidence to prosecute him for the more serious offense in Taiwan.\n\nChan\u2019s case led to months of increasingly violent protests in Hong Kong after Chief Executive Carrie Lam cited it to introduce deeply unpopular legislation that would allow extraditions to China. The unrest has also spurred animosity between Lam, who was elected to her current position by a committee dominated by Beijing loyalists, and Taiwan President Tsai Ing-Wen, whose party favors independence from China.\n\nNow squabbling between Hong Kong and Taiwan over jurisdiction, sovereignty and legal technicalities makes it unclear if Chan will face justice for the murder. Hong Kong wants Chan to board a plane and fly to the island to turn himself in, while Taiwanese authorities want to send law enforcement officers to escort him.\n\n\u201cIts publicly stated support for the suspect to take a flight to Taiwan totally ignores the safety of the other passengers on board the same flight,\u201d the Mainland Affairs Council in Taipei, which manages the island\u2019s relations with China, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cAllowing the suspect to turn himself in is a political goal that will, in the long run, turn Hong Kong into a criminal paradise where murder suspects can roam freely. It is incredible.\u201d\n\nTaiwan\u2019s foreign ministry said on Twitter that Lam refused judicial cooperation to send the suspect back and stand trial. The tweets, signed with the initials of Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, accused her of releasing Chan to justify Hong Kong\u2019s extradition legislation, and reiterated that the island isn\u2019t part of China.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the city\u2019s government said Taiwan\u2019s plan to collect Chan showed \u201cdisrespect for Hong Kong\u2019s jurisdictional power and is totally unacceptable.\u201d Chan was a \u201cfree man\u201d who could travel as he pleased, it said, adding that Taiwan authorities can arrest him once he arrives. Hong Kong\u2019s government ultimately answers to authorities in Beijing, who view Taiwan as a Chinese province.\n\nTaiwan in 2016 arrested three murder suspects at the request of Hong Kong and allowed police officers from the city to collect them, Wang Ting-yu, a senior Taiwanese lawmaker from Tsai\u2019s ruling party, said on Twitter.\n\nLater Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed a question about the case, saying it was \u201cnot a diplomatic matter\u201d since Beijing considers both jurisdictions part of China. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s government will deal with it appropriately,\u201d Hua told a news briefing in Beijing.\n\nAfter he was released from prison, Chan apologized for the \u201cirreversible mistake\u201d he made and for the pain he caused the family of the victim, Poon Hiu-wing.\n\n\u201cI am willing to return to Taiwan to face sentence and trial for my recklessness and mistake I made,\u201d Chan told reporters. \u201cTo society and the Hong Kong people -- sorry.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Chinese foreign ministry statement in ninth paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Adela Lin, Miaojung Lin and Peter Martin.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Natalie Lung in Hong Kong at flung6@bloomberg.net;Iain Marlow in Hong Kong at imarlow1@bloomberg.net;Chinmei Sung in Taipei at csung4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The war of words between Hong Kong and Taiwan is heating up as a murder suspect at the center of months of unrest in the financial hub was released from jail.Chan Tong-kai, who admitted in court to killing his girlfriend in 2018 while on a vacation in Taiwan, was set free on Wednesday", "authors": ["Natalie Lung", "Iain Marlow", "Chinmei Sung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jXu3sw5AtHgn7fdIrRtWcA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/6d5e2d07e2685933b39f65ce3ef3959e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
