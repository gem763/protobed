AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe handshake between the pair was brief, with Murray continuing to press his point to Murphy before leaving the court.\n\nMurray has had many tough tussles with Fognini over the years, winning four and losing three of their previous seven matches.\n\nThe Italian landed the first blow with a break of the Murray serve to lead 2-1 only for Murray to reel off three games in a row, securing the second break with a backhand winner flashed brilliantly cross-court.\n\nHowever, Fognini produced some high-quality points of his own to get back on serve immediately and, after both men had survived pressure on their own serves, it was the Italian who edged the tie-break, a double fault proving costly for Murray.\n\nThe Scot responded very well, breaking Fognini for 3-2 in the second set and then making it five games in a row after his opponent had a mental lapse.\n\nHe was back fully focused at the start of the decider, though, and it was nip and tuck all the way through to the dramatic final stages.\n\nCameron Norrie was also beaten in the second round, losing 6-3 6-1 to US Open finalist Daniil Medvedev.\n\nMeanwhile, Murray will be welcomed back to the Australian Open in January a year after the tournament bade him an emotional farewell.\n\nTournament director Craig Tiley confirmed the former world number one, who can enter events using a protected ranking of two, will be in Melbourne for the first grand slam of 2020.\n\n\u201cFor sure Andy will be here,\u201d Tiley told Australian radio station Triple M on Tuesday. \u201cI was on the phone to his agent this morning. He is going to be in Australia early.\n\n\u201cHe is ready to return. Remember he said goodbye a year ago. It\u2019s great in that period he had surgery and has rebounded really well.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Andy Murray lost a fiery encounter with Fabio Fognini in the second round of the Shanghai Masters after twice failing to serve it out.
