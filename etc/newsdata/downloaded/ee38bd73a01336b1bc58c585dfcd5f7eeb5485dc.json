Keanu Reeves\u2019 titular character rarely misses his shot, dispatching enemies in the most efficient manner possible. Often he\u2019ll incapacitate someone, take out someone else, and return to the first target for the final kill. It makes you wonder whether anyone could possibly be that elegant and mindful in a real-world firefight.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t, of course, which is why John Wick Hex, a new game billed as a prequel to the movies, sounds like a great idea. Instead of going the obvious route of adapting the franchise into a Max Payne-style third-person shooter, designer Mike Bithell (Thomas was Alone, Volume) has come up with an original strategy-based concept that translates John Wick\u2019s methodical action into a format where you have time to think.\n\nAs you might expect from the title, John Wick Hex plays out on a hex-based grid, although the game\u2019s minimalist comic book-style art doesn\u2019t actually go as far as to render the shapes on the ground. While actions are only set in motion once you give John a command, the combat isn\u2019t technically turn-based, unlike many strategy games. Instead, each action takes up a specific amount of time, and the game\u2019s central challenge comes from managing this time so that you get to the enemies before they get to you.\n\nLet\u2019s say you enter a room and see a bad guy standing with his back to you. You sidle up to him in a split second, then take another 1.4 seconds to take him down, directing his lifeless body behind a table. At this point, two more enemies enter the room, so you crouch and roll behind another table, taking another 0.9 seconds and a couple of points off your \u201cfocus\u201d meter, which will affect your aim when you stand up to shoot the first enemy. You still have an 80 percent chance to make the shot, and thankfully you do. But the second enemy has enough time to fire a shot back at you, so you need to dive into your limited bandage supply to patch yourself up, which takes another three seconds. She\u2019s approaching your table. Will you be able to shoot her in time, or will you have to parry her attack, or were you ultimately doomed by your decision to roll behind that table a few seconds ago?\n\n\u201cI wanted to make something that was in that world, but provoked questions rather than answering them.\u201d - Mike Bithell on designing John Wick Hex\n\nJohn Wick Hex is entirely made up of situations like this, and when it works, it\u2019s really satisfying. The time-management aspect is smartly designed, deconstructing the movies\u2019 combat sequences into a series of quick decisions. Each stage is tightly designed and puts up a good challenge. A lot of thought has been put into devising the death traps for your Keanu-inspired avatar to navigate.\n\nUnfortunately, the game just isn\u2019t as slick as the movies. You will die a lot in John Wick Hex, and success often comes down to trial and error. Even when you do succeed, though, there\u2019s little payoff. You can watch a replay of your actions strung together, but there\u2019s no cinematic verve. Mostly, you\u2019ll see a crude Keanu-ish model walking back and forth with stilted animations. There\u2019s only so much you can do when your character is restricted to six directions and not many more colors.\n\nOften, John Wick Hex reminded me of Hotline Miami and Katana Zero, two more games that are mostly about entering rooms, deciding which order to kill people in, and dying a lot. But John Wick Hex has none of the twitchy 2D exhilaration of those games, which do a great job of making you feel like a badass the one time you do get it right.\n\nPart of this is just the nature of a cerebral strategy game, of course, and there wouldn\u2019t be much point to John Wick Hex if you managed to beat everything the first time. The small scope of each stage, however, makes each new attempt feel like less of an opportunity to try new tactics and more like you just haven\u2019t stumbled across the correct order of commands yet. There\u2019s little room for improvisation or creativity in your approach.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, even likely, that I\u2019m just not cut out to be a cold-blooded assassin. John Wick Hex is a smart take on the franchise in many ways, and it might well click for you more than it did for me. (If it does, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re cut out to be an assassin, just to be clear.) But while I respect its substance, I came away wishing for a little more style.", "description": "John Wick Hex is a game that attempts to turn the stylish action of the Keanu Reeves movies into a more cerebral strategy experience.", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FEMDaLVO31vIrrimVLUgzFu6w1U=/0x50:2560x1390/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16220901/John_Wick_Hex_Throat_5.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
