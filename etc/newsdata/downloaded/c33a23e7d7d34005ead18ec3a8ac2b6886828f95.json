While the startup never really got as successful or famous, it did give me the opportunity to work with some people who had some experience working at bigger corporates. As a young person who still had a lot of professional navigation to do, I ended up asking one of the employees about why they\u2019d companies which are touted to offer dream jobs and stability for something that\u2019s just starting out and her response left me scared:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought about corporates as well but after three years of hard work, I felt like my ambition was gone. I\u2019d walk into office, meet my deadlines somehow and get home only to repeat the same thing over again.\u201d\n\nBut if you love what you do, then having the same routine daily shouldn\u2019t feel so bad, right?

Deadlines that are impossible to meet which only creates stress, guilted for taking a leave when needed and calls that you\u2019re going to reply to well beyond work hours. I felt like I wanted to go to work to make life better but it was taking up my whole life. I just felt so exhausted that the only way I could see out of this mental state of hopelessness I was in was just about resigning.\u201d\n\nAnd her story doesn\u2019t seem too far-fetched.\n\nIf recent surveys and research are to be taken into account, India needs to start concentrating on the mental health of its employees more than ever. Not only will it benefit the workforce but it will also benefit the employers as they lose out on less work and welcome more productivity.", "description": "If you\u2019re an employed person who goes to work five days a week, eight hours each on average then it won\u2019t be wrong to say that there have been days when you\u2019ve woken up feeling exhausted even if it\u2019s just a Tuesday.
