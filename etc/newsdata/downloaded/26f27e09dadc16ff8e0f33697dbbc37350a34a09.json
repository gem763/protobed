It was spooky,\" Jamie Myles, who lived in a flat near Farrell's, said in a statement read out at Swansea Crown Court today.\n\nFarrell told police he stabbed Miss Lodwig after a row at the address in Swansea.\n\nHer body was found covered in blood on April 23.\n\n(Image: MEDIA WALES)\n\nClaire Morse, a forensic scientist, said tests on two makeshift belts found at the property were consistent with being placed in or around Ms Lodwig's mouth while she was being attacked.\n\nThe expert told the court the distribution of Ms Lodwig's blood and DNA evidence in Farrell's bedroom and on his clothing were compatible with the way he later allegedly confessed to murdering her.\n\nBut while the defendant denies murder, he has pleaded guilty to manslaughter, an alternative charge for the killing.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMichael Jones, prosecuting, said Farrell confessed to the killing in a chilling letter.\n\n\"That letter confessed to murder of Sammy-Lee,\" the lawyer said.\n\n\"He'd actually used the word 'murdered'.\n\n\"We say it's a chilling document and one you will be able to see and read for yourself.\"\n\n(Image: Jonathan Myers)\n\nThe prosecutor said Farrell was also accused of a \"brutal attack\" on Christopher Maher, the new boyfriend of Ms Lodwig's mother, just days before the alleged murder.\n\nFarrell had split from Sarah Lodwig in 2010 after receiving a 13-year sentence for stabbing another man.\n\nHe denies murder, wounding with intent, and unlawful wounding.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Jason Farrell allegedly murdered Sammy-Lee Lodwig at his flat in Swansea, south Wales", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Media Wales", "Pa", "Jonathan Myers"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637404.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196053865.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
