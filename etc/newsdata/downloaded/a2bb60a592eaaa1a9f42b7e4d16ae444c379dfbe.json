Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NBA\u2019s fine for tossing a basketball into the stands appears to be $25,000 \u2014 whether the throw is made in anger or in celebration.\n\nThe league docked Los Angeles Clippers guard Patrick Beverley that amount Wednesday, a day after he threw a ball into the crowd at the end of his team\u2019s season-opening, 112-102 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nLast December, Beverley also was fined $25,000 for a similar incident. However, in that case, he threw the ball at a fan whom he said had cursed at him regarding Beverley\u2019s mother. That incident had prompted Beverley to be ejected from the game, a 114-110 Clippers loss to the host Dallas Mavericks.\n\nOn Tuesday, with the clock winding down at the game\u2019s end, Beverley high-fived teammate Montrezl Harrell, then waited for the buzzer to sound before tossing the ball \u2014 underhand \u2014 deep into the stands at the Staples Center.\n\nBeverley, 31, finished with two points, 10 rebounds and six assists while playing 31 minutes against the Lakers. Last season, he averaged 7.6 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.8 assists in 78 games (49 starts).\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The NBA's fine for tossing a basketball into the stands appears to be $25,000 -- whether the throw is made in anger or in celebration.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444314097&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N001-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
