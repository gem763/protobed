I turned, \u201cWho is she running to, there is no one behind me\u201d and she throws her arms around me and gives me this big hug and kisses me on the cheek and says that she loves me.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m like, \u201cOh my God, I love you too! This is great!\u201d She was like, \u201cI just needed proof of this\u201d and then she posed for some paparazzi and then posted this picture on Instagram, \u201cMy life has been made, Pinkman for President!\u201d\u2019\n\nListening to that story, we genuinely don\u2019t know who we\u2019re more jealous of.\n\nFollowing the success of El Camino, some critics expressed frustration at the lack of female characters in the film, but Aaron told Metro.co.uk that it should definitely be taken as a compliment.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry that you have an issue with it. But maybe take it as a compliment that all the bad people happen to be men. Right?\n\n\u2018Maybe they could\u2019ve come up with a great villain, female character, but I don\u2019t know. Another time!\u2019\n\nHey, if that means we get another sequel, we\u2019re more than happy to wait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is available now on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
