The whistleblower found this telephone call to be of \"urgent concern\" because of the president's apparent intermingling of U.S. foreign policy interests with his personal political interests in apparent violation of U.S. law.\"\n\nThe association insisted that their focus was not on \"the legality of the president's actions or even the merits of the whistleblower's complaint,\" nor on \"whether the DOJ's review of this action was justified.\"\n\nInstead, the association raised concerns about whether Barr had knowledge of promises made by Trump in the phone call. In addition, the association said Barr \"was obligated to recuse himself from any involvement in DOJ's review of either the whistleblower complaint of the substance of the president's actions once the president offered Mr. Barr's services to President Zelensky.\"\n\nBarr's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), under the Department of Justice, also advised Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, a Trump appointee, to forgo forwarding the whistleblower's complaint to Congress, despite Michael Atkinson, intelligence community inspector general, saying it was credible and of \u201curgent concern.\"\n\nThe bar association wrote that Barr \"appears to have participated in the DOJ review of the whistleblower's complaint and its decision not to forward that complaint to Congress\" and his failure to recuse himself endangers the DOJ's \"impartiality in the investigation of the Ukraine Matter.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe bar also suggested that Barr be forced to resign, face sanctions, or be removed from Congress if he doesn't recuse himself from the probe.", "description": "The New York City Bar Association is demanding that U.S. Attorney General William Barr recuse himself from the Department of Justice probe into the Trump-Ukraine phone call that is central to the impeachment inquiry against the president, citing potential conflicts of interest, the group said in a statement Wednesday.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
