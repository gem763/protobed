People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.\u201d\n\nThe president, a climate change denier who has gutted environmental regulations to favor coal and oil companies, added his own sarcastic commentary on Thunberg: \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d\n\nShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see! https://t.co/1tQG6QcVKO \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nThunberg delivered her powerful speech Monday at the U.N. Climate Action Summit.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be standing here.

How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has called climate change a \u201choax,\u201d was not slated to attend the summit, but unexpectedly caught a few minutes of the event. Thunberg gave him a cold stare as he passed her \u2015 a moment the internet loved.\n\nLove HuffPost?
