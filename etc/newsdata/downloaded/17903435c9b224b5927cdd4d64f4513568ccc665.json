We look forward to working with many of them,\" said the independent travel agent's founders in a statement.\n\n\"The agreement will see Hays Travel acquire a total of 555 stores around the UK, providing re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former employees of Thomas Cook's retail operations who were made redundant,\" the statement added.\n\nWednesday's announcement was welcomed by the British government and travel industry trade union the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA).\n\nAnd it offers hope to the 9,000 UK staff who were made unemployed overnight when the group collapsed in acrimony.\n\nDavid Chapman, director of the Official Receiver, remarked that the sale \"represents an important step in the liquidation process, as we seek to realise the company's assets\".\n\nJim Tucker, partner at administrator KPMG, also added that the Hays deal \"provides re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former Thomas Cook employees, and secures the future of retail sites up and down the UK high street\".\n\nThe Official Liquidator, when asked by AFP about the outlook for the sale of Thomas Cook's remaining assets, declined to comment - but added they would be sold \"in the best interests\" of its creditors.\n\nThe collapsed company's notable assets include 100 aircraft at its airline division, and 200 hotels and hotels clubs that are based around the world.\n\nUK airline Easyjet has hinted that it could be interested in some of Thomas Cook's air operations, as the low-cost carrier already serves some of its destinations.\n\nBritain's government on Monday completed the country's biggest peacetime repatriation, returning 140,000 UK-based Thomas Cook customers stranded abroad by the company's bankruptcy.\n\nIn total, around 600,000 customers were left stranded following the collapse of the 178 year-old company less than three weeks ago, including around 140,000 who had been due to return to Germany.\n\nThe company's demise sparked 22,000 job losses worldwide.\n\nThe debt-plagued travel titan struggled against fierce online competition for years and blamed Brexit uncertainty for a drop in bookings.\n\nIt declared bankruptcy on September 23 after failing to secure fresh funds. Its biggest shareholder was China's Fosun Group.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Consumer - [LONDON] Britain kicked off Wednesday the dismantling of Thomas Cook, with the sale of all 555 UK stores to a smaller rival of the collapsed holiday giant. .
