REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nDjokovic beat Goffin in one hour and 29 minutes, extending his head-to-head record against the 2017 champion to seven wins, and will now face Australia\u2019s Millman who beat American Reilly Opelka in the other semi-final.\n\nTop seeded Djokovic hit seven aces and won 87% of his first-service points against Goffin in the Serb\u2019s first tournament since withdrawing from the U.S. Open fourth round with a shoulder injury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very satisfied with the way I\u2019ve been playing the whole week,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very positive week on the court, off the week as well. Hopefully I\u2019ll be able to crown it tomorrow with a trophy.\n\n\u201cObviously he was in good form and played really well against Chung yesterday in the quarters.\n\n\u201cThe conditions are playing quick here. The surface doesn\u2019t bounce that much, so you\u2019ve got to be very low and quick on return as well. It definitely was not easy when both of us were serving well.\u201d\n\nDjokovic has dominated opponents in Tokyo and is yet to drop a set in the tournament and the 16-times Grand Slam champion needed only two breaks of serve to win in straight sets and reach his fifth final of the season.\n\nEarlier, Millman took down Opelka 6-3 7-6(4) to reach his first ever ATP 500 final.\n\nBig-serving Opelka fired 13 aces but could not convert either of his two break points while Millman needed only one break of serve in the opening set before winning the second in the tiebreak.\n\n\u201cThat was a pretty good match, it\u2019s always difficult playing against someone like Reilly who has got such a massive serve,\u201d Millman said. \u201cI was really happy to take the few little chances I had and took care of my own service games pretty well.\n\n\u201cI get to play a final of an ATP 500 in such a special place like Tokyo. For me, that\u2019s why you play. That\u2019s why you go through the graft and some of the tougher times, to give yourself an opportunity like this. It\u2019s pretty special.\u201d", "description": "World number one Novak Djokovic eased past Belgian third seed David Goffin 6-3 6-4 at the Japan Open in Tokyo on Saturday to book his place in Sunday's final against John Millman.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437354360&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9409B", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
