This one is in Japan and will be broadcast live around the world by Discovery-owned GOLFTV.\n\nThe exhibition is called \u201cThe Challenge: Japan Skins,\u201d and it will be played Oct. 21 leading into the PGA Tour\u2019s first official event in Japan. It features four of golf\u2019s biggest names from each of their continents - Woods, Rory McIlroy of Europe, Jason Day of Australia and Japanese star Hideki Matsuyama.\n\n\u201cThis is our opportunity to think outside the box,\u201d said Alex Kaplan, president and general manager of Discovery Golf. \u201cWe\u2019ll put guys in different situations, and it will be a surprise to them what they are. There\u2019s going to be some fun tweaks these guys aren\u2019t used to.\u201d\n\nWoods played four times in the original Skins Game, which had become a Thanksgiving weekend tradition in the California desert until it began losing star power and was held for the last time in 2008, three years after Woods\u2018 final appearance. He never won in four tries.\n\n\u201cAfter discussing \u2018The Challenge\u2019 with Discovery and GOLFTV, I wanted to be a part of it,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been back to Japan since 2006 and the golf fans there are some of the best in the world. It\u2019s a unique format and a top field with Rory, Jason and Hideki. I can\u2019t wait to play against them on a global stage.\u201d\n\nWoods signed a deal with Discovery last December in which he gives exclusive content to GOLFTV. Discovery last year agreed to a 12-year, $2 billion deal with the PGA Tour to deliver golf content direct to consumers in 220 markets outside the United States.\n\nBecause the PGA Tour is sanctioning the event, it will be shown on Golf Channel in U.S. markets.\n\nThe biggest challenge was figuring out when to play.\n\nBecause the event will be shown on demand for free around the world - fans in the UK and Ireland will be have to subscribe because of existing rights deals - Discovery Golf determined that a 1 p.m. start at Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club in Chiba would be the best fit.\n\nThat means it will start at midnight Sunday in the eastern U.S. after the NFL is over, and 9 p.m. on the West Coast. It will start in the early morning of Europe. Australia is one hour ahead of Japan.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a perfect time,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cYou map out where the key markets are and what\u2019s possible on the course and do your best possible. It\u2019s where you drive the most viewership, and then you look at when the sun goes down. We could have started in the morning, but Japan and Asia are important markets for Discovery. We had to make sure we had it at a meaningful time. The lunch hour does that, particularly for streaming.\u201d\n\nKaplan said some 3,000 fans are expected on the course, many of them as guests, others allowed to buy tickets. Because of limited October daylight, he said lights would be erected on the last few holes if needed.\n\nMcIlroy, who has a similar partnership as Woods with NBC Sports Group, was intrigued by the format and the field.\n\n\u201cPlaying with Hideki on his home turf, Tiger coming back to Japan with a green jacket, the motivation is certainly there for me,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a huge fan of the skins format. I love the way it rewards attacking play and think it suits my game quite well. The other fun thing about skins is how you find yourself rooting for the other guys if you\u2019re not in a position to win the hole.\u201d\n\nPlayers need to win a hole outright, or it carries over to the next hole. Total prize money is $350,000 - $10,000 per skin for the opening six holes, $20,000 for the next six holes, $20,000 through the 17th hole, and $100,000 for the 18th. There also will be charitable component.\n\nStill to be revealed are the announcing crews. Kaplan said the Japan Skins will be produced in Japanese and English.\n\nIt starts what figures to be a big week in golf-crazed Japan. The Japan Skins is at the front end of the ZoZo Championship, the first official PGA Tour event in Japan, with a field expected to include Woods, McIlroy, Matsuyama, Day, Justin Thomas and possibly Jordan Spieth. Japan is in the middle of a three-week Asia swing, with South Korea at the front end and the HSBC Champions in Shanghai as the anchor.\n\nKaplan said more specialty events on GOLFTV are likely.\n\n\u201cWe want to continue doing things like this, presenting golf in new and interesting ways,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019m super excited about the production. We\u2019re not going to rely on each player to tell their story. We\u2019ll make it fun and interactive, but we\u2019ll help these guys be fun and interactive.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tiger Woods is playing another skins game with two big differences.
