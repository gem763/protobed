The closure adds to a 2019 tally that includes Ohio truckload company Falcon Transport Co. and regional less-than-truckload carriers New England Motor Freight Inc. and LME Inc.\n\nFormer HVH Chief Executive John Kenneally said he is negotiating with the carrier\u2019s bank on steps to help get the drivers\u2019 fuel cards reactivated so they can deliver their loads and get home. The company has about 380 trucks, including those tied to a related Canadian company, FTI Transportation, which also shut this week, Mr. Kenneally said. That company also belonged to HVH\u2019s owner, private-equity firm HCI Equity Partners.\n\nThe increasing number of closures come as trucking companies that boosted driver pay and plowed last year\u2019s profits into record orders for new equipment now are wrestling with a tougher pricing environment and slackening demand.\n\nIn 2018, \u201cdemand was so strong, rates were so strong, it was virtually impossible to fail,\u201d said Donald Broughton, Broughton Capital\u2019s managing partner.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nTrucking rates stalled out in July, falling 0.1% from the prior year after a 27-month run of annual increases, according to the Cass Truckload Linehaul Index, which measures per-mile pricing for truckload carriers. Prices on trucking\u2019s spot market, where shippers book last-minute transportation, were down nearly 19% last month compared with 2018, according to online freight marketplace DAT Solutions LLC.\n\nThat swing has hurt transport operators that shifted more business to the spot market last year to take advantage of surging rates. That also has proved painful for smaller operators that depend more on trucking\u2019s spot market and may not have the leverage big trucking companies have with shipping customers to build higher prices into their contract rates.\n\nSome trucking companies say rising insurance costs also are weighing on the business. Mr. Kenneally said HVH\u2019s monthly insurance bill more than doubled this year, to about $368,000 from $150,000 in 2018.\n\nSome trucking executives believe the recent spate of smaller carrier bankruptcies will give \u201clarger carriers added control and pricing power in the marketplace,\u201d Cowen & Co. transportation analyst Jason Seidl wrote in a research note last month.\n\nMany big operators both bolstered their balance sheets during last year\u2019s freight surge and deepened their ties to shipping customers with a broader array of services.\n\nThis week, Iowa-based truckload operator Heartland Express Inc. bought trucker Millis Transfer Inc. for about $150 million. Heartland last month reported its net profit jumped 25.6% in the second quarter despite declining revenue, and cash on the truckload carrier\u2019s balance sheet jumped more than 27% from the end of 2018 to June 30, to $205.6 million.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "description": "Approximately 640 carriers went out of business in the first half of 2019, up from 175 for the same period last year and more than double the total number of trucker failures in 2018, according to transportation industry data firm Broughton Capital LLC.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102572/social"}
