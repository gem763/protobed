In the texts, Guyger jokes about Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s death, mocks her black colleagues and discusses a dog that her friend warns \u201cmay be racist.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.. I\u2019m the same,\u201d Guyger wrote back about the dog, just days before she fatally shot 26-year-old Botham Jean in his Dallas apartment on Sept. 6, 2018. One minute later, she texted again: \u201cI hate everything and everyone but y\u2019all.\u201d\n\n[Amber Guyger, police officer who shot a man to death in his apartment, found guilty of murder]\n\nProsecutors will use Guyger\u2019s texts, her social media posts and her disciplinary record as a police officer to argue for a harsher sentence, though they haven\u2019t specified what length of prison term they will request. The jury will decide her sentence, which could range from five years to life in prison, without the possibility of probation.\n\nThe sentencing phase of the case will continue Wednesday, and the prosecution and defense will share additional testimony, including from Guyger who is expected to testify for a second time, The Washington Post reported.\n\nOther texts by Guyger had already played an important role in her trial, when prosecutors argued a sexually explicit exchange with her partner on the Dallas police force distracted her as she walked to Jean\u2019s apartment, which was one floor above her own. Guyger\u2019s defense disputed that claim, saying the two had ended an affair months before. She mistakenly entered the wrong apartment because she was tired after a nearly 14-hour shift, her defense attorney argued, and then shot Jean twice, thinking he was a burglar.\n\nThat claim did not sway the jurors, who deliberated for five hours before reaching a unanimous guilty verdict around 10:45 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe new texts introduced after the verdict showed her mocking black officers working for the Dallas Police Department with her partner, Officer Martin Rivera.\n\n\u201cDamn I was at this area with 5 different black officers !!!\u201d Rivera texted Guyger on March 9, 2018. \u201cNot racist but damn.\u201d\n\nGuyger echoed Rivera and added: \u201cNot racist but just have a different way of working and it shows.\u201d\n\nDuring a 2018 parade on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Guyger texted another officer about their lengthy shift as attendees celebrated the black civil rights activist\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cWhen does this end lol,\u201d read a text sent to Guyger. She replied: \u201cWhen MLK is dead \u2026 oh wait \u2026\u201d\n\nProsecutors also showed images of Pinterest posts about guns and violence that Guyger had saved and commented on. One post showed a photo of a \u201cMinion\u201d character from the \u201cDespicable Me\u201d movies with the caption: \u201cPeople are so ungrateful. No one ever thanks me for having the patience not to kill them.\u201d Guyger commented about owning a gun on another meme that read, \u201cI wear all black to remind you not to mess with me because I\u2019m already dressed for your funeral.\u201d\n\nAfter the verdict, Guyger\u2019s former supervisor, Dallas Police Sgt. Robert Watson, also recounted filing an internal affairs referral after the officer allowed a handcuffed prisoner to escape her custody. She did not immediately report the full details of the incident, he said. But during cross-examination, Watson told the court he thought Guyger had been a dependable, hard-working officer.\n\nWhen Jean\u2019s mother and sister took the stand Tuesday, they spoke emotionally about their relationship with the 26-year-old accountant who had immigrated to the United States from St. Lucia.\n\nAllison Jean took the stand and tearfully remembered her son\u2019s life. He had placed 23rd on the island in the entrance exam that landed him a coveted spot at St. Lucia\u2019s top high school. As a teen, he started a choir at his school and loved to sing. He moved to Arkansas to study accounting at Harding University before getting a job at financial firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. He would have been 28 on Sunday, she said.\n\n\u201cI always refer to him as the glue of my three kids,\u201d she said.\n\nProsecutors played videos of Botham Jean singing at a worship service while his older sister, Allisa Findley, sat on the stand, the Dallas Morning News reported.\n\n\u201cI want my brother back,\u201d she told the court.\n\nIn a red dress and pearls, Allison Jean wiped her eyes and told the jury how, while visiting her daughter in New York, she learned at 12:13 a.m. on Sept. 7, 2018, that her son had been killed.\n\n\u201cMy life has not been the same,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has just been like a roller coaster. I cannot sleep; I cannot eat. It\u2019s just been the most terrible time for me. I almost am not able to work, but I just try to busy myself just to see if it will get out of my head. But it\u2019s been very, very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nShe told the court she had been sick often. She said she worried her youngest son was not coping with his brother\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI have to try to keep the family together because everybody is in pain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had a very, very close family.\u201d", "description": "Dallas police officer Amber Guyger tried to delete offensive texts from her phone shortly after the shooting.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter", "October At Am", "Katie Shepherd Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
