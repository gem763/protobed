The news of him being charged devastates Shona Ramsey (Julia Goulding), who now fears that he won\u2019t be released in time for their wedding.\n\nThe police question David about the attack on Josh, and \u2014 while doing so \u2014 they show him the video footage from the incident, which shows David nearby Josh with scissors.\n\nIn spite of the evidence stacked against him, David claims that he\u2019s innocent \u2014 and it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s worried about whether or not the officers will believe him.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Platt household, Shona (Julia Goulding) informs both Gail (Helen Worth) and Sarah (Tina O\u2019Brien) that the balance of money is due today for the wedding venue which her and David were hoping to use for their big day, but \u2014 as there\u2019s no guarantee that David will be out of prison in time \u2014 she\u2019s unsure of how to proceed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, her dreams of David being released in time for the wedding are ultimate dashed, as she receives a text from Imran (Charlie de Melo) which informs her that David has been charged with attempted murder.\n\nAs a result, Shona, Gail, Sarah, and Nick (Ben Price) all attend David\u2019s hearing in the Magistrate\u2019s Court. David, Abe and Tez all plead not guilty to the attempted murder of Josh, but \u2014 in spite of this \u2014 David is refused bail and remanded in custody until the trial.\n\nHowever, Shona\u2019s hopeful once more about David possibly being released in time for the wedding when Imran later informs her that Josh has regained consciousness.\n\nThe question is: what will the rapist have to say for himself?\n\nCould his words be enough to clear David\u2019s name so that he can get out of prison in time to enjoy his happy day with Shona?\n\nOne to watch: Friday 1st November at 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "As if David didn't already have enough to worry about!", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Shona-and-David-4766_1572177420.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
