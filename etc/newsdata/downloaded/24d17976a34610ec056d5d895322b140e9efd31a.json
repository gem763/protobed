Fox has an extra $15 million a year to play with now that Shep is out. If \u2014 if \u2014 the \u201cfair and balanced\u201d slogan still has value to them, they\u2019ll spread that 15 mil among the remaining news division staff to avert an exodus. Make everyone happy, or at least less miserable.\n\n\u201cIt feels like death in the news division,\u201d a senior Fox employee told CNN about Smith\u2019s departure, saying staffers at the network were \u201cshocked\u201d and that some were crying. \u201cAt least we had him.\u201d \u201cWho can fill that role?\u201d another Fox employee asked. A third Fox employee, who said \u201cstaffers were openly weeping\u201d after the announcement, noted that some staffers \u201cwere here and have stayed here solely for\u201d Smith. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s an exodus,\u201d the person told CNN, adding, \u201cFox hasn\u2019t just lost Shep today.\u201d\n\nThey could also hire a replacement for Shep who\u2019s respected as a journalist to signal to news staff that the network isn\u2019t going to turn itself into Trump state TV (during daytime hours, at least). The tricky part would be finding someone who\u2019s less anti-Trump than Shep, so that the infighting with the opinion hosts doesn\u2019t recur, but also not pro-Trump or else the news people will see it as a Trumpist takeover of their division. Is there any unemployed TV journalist who lands in that sweet spot? Lara Logan, maybe?\n\nI think Bill Hemmer will get the 3 p.m. slot. He\u2019s a known quantity at Fox, likable, presumably acceptable to the news side but not a guy known for snarking at the president like Smith was.\n\nAnother reason to believe Fox will work hard to prevent a news-division exodus even if it means ponying up money to keep their current talent in place is that it\u2019d be foolish to go all-in on Trump when POTUS may have little more than a year left in office. Conceivably even less if, against all odds, impeachment and removal start to look more attractive to Senate Republicans. The political identity of Fox\u2019s viewers shifts every time there\u2019s a change in control of the White House: They were ardent hawks during the era of Bush, 9/11, and Iraq; they were ardent small-government conservatives during the era of Obama and ObamaCare; now they\u2019re ardent nationalists in the Trump mold. If Elizabeth Warren beats Trump next year, odds are good that there\u2019ll be an opportunistic renaissance on the right in believing that state power is the greatest threat facing America and that the national debt is an urgent crisis. Hannity will rediscover his inner tea partier; Tucker\u2019s nationalist pitch to viewers will need to be tweaked. Because the GOP no longer stands firmly for any policies beyond gun rights and opposition to abortion, there\u2019s no telling what message might be in demand among Fox viewers circa January 2021 without Trump as a political north star.\n\nSo why the hell would Fox go full Trump now? If they\u2019re going to do that, logically they\u2019ll at least wait until he\u2019s safely reelected. All of the current news people should receive lucrative contracts \u2014 lucrative one-year contracts, that is.\n\nAs for Shep, various reports out today confirm yesterday\u2019s suspicions: Yes, he quit because of \u201ctension\u201d between him and the opinion division, although his precise grievance is momentarily hard to pin down. Some say that he got fed up with the sheer volume of Trump propaganda on the network. Others say he was tired of having shots taken at him by the opinion hosts, although (a) Tucker\u2019s the only one I\u2019m aware of who\u2019s swiped at Smith recently and (b) Shep gave as good as he got. He\u2019s the one who went on the air and called it \u201crepugnant\u201d that Carlson let one of his guests describe one of Shep\u2019s guests as a \u201cfool.\u201d And Shep has been known to slight the opinion division in broad terms during interviews, telling Time last year of the primetime hosts, \u201cWe serve different masters. We work for different reporting chains, we have different rules. They don\u2019t really have rules on the opinion side. They can say whatever they want. If it\u2019s their opinion. I don\u2019t really watch a lot of opinion programming. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\nA report from CNN makes it sound like Smith\u2019s real complaint was that he thought Fox management had begun taking sides:\n\nThe breaking point for Smith was the tension between him and the opinion side of Fox. In late September, you\u2019ll remember, Tucker Carlson mocked Smith for standing up for his friend and colleague Judge Andrew Napolitano after the judge was called a \u201cfool\u201d by one of Carlson\u2019s guests. The network\u2019s lack of a vocal defense for Smith following the incident bothered him and the whole episode factored into his decision to leave, a person familiar with the matter told me. BUT: Contrary to rampant speculation, Smith was never given an \u201cultimatum\u201d to stop criticizing Carlson. Instead, I\u2019m told that Smith was reminded about the Fox\u2019s old adage regarding \u201cnot shooting inside the tent.\u201d Bottom line: \u201cIt is clear where the 2nd floor\u2019s allegiance lies,\u201d the person said, meaning that Fox execs care more about appeasing Carlson than Smith.\n\nEveryone agrees that it was Shep who pulled the plug, not Fox \u2014 but that\u2019s not to say Fox management didn\u2019t see some upside in him walking:\n\nAnother Fox source points out that Rupert wasn\u2019t happy that Shep was earning $15 million per year to host a daytime show, a contract from the Ailes era \u2014 Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) October 11, 2019\n\nThere was one more interesting reaction last night, from the highest-rated man on Fox\u2019s opinion side:\n\nI\u2019ve always said there is nobody better at breaking news than Shep Smith. He has always done great things and I know he will continue to do so. Looking forward to seeing Shep crush it in whatever he does next. \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 11, 2019\n\nHannity has grumbled about Smith sporadically in the past but he and Shep were both day-one hires at Fox. They\u2019ve managed to put aside their differences for more than two decades, and when Hannity jabs at him, he tends not to do it directly. Was Smith\u2019s supposed problem with the opinion division really a problem with the whole division or was it a problem with Tucker Carlson specifically?\n\nConsider that your exit question. Here\u2019s another former Fox News newsman turned harsh critic, Carl Cameron, mourning Shep\u2019s departure last night on the left\u2019s favorite cable news network.", "description": "\"Fox hasn't just lost Shep today.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ss-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
