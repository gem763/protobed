Screengrab from YouTube / Unexpected Journeys\n\nIn Singapore\u2019s latest tourism push, Singapore Airlines (SIA) and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) have teamed up to release a new YouTube film series, titled \u201cUnexpected Journeys\u201d, on Monday (Sept 23).\n\nThe series features Singapore comedian Rishi Budhrani as he travels to three unconventional holiday destinations \u2013 Bland in Australia\u2019 New South Wales, Dull in Perkshire, Scotland and Boring in Oregon, United States.\n\n\u201cUnexpected Journeys\u201d follows Rishi\u2019s adventures as he is hosted by locals in these uniquely-named towns. In return, he brings his hosts back to Singapore (via SIA of course) to show them his take on the Crazy Rich Asians destination.\n\nUnlike the usual destination videos that show the glitz, glamour and often tacky tourist attractions of a city, STB and SIA have created an entertaining series with all the ingredients needed for a viral video in the age of social media.\n\nI watched the series, which so far only has three episodes, and found myself (surprisingly) entertained by Rishi\u2019s hilarious travelogue.\n\nFor example, when he went to Bland and got sheared like a sheep\n\ncaption source Screengrab from YouTube / Unexpected Journeys\n\nOr when he expected to get a his own dirt-bike\u2026\n\ncaption source Screengrab from YouTube / Unexpected Journeys\n\nBut ended up with this one instead.\n\ncaption source Screengrab from YouTube / Unexpected Journeys\n\nRishi\u2019s travelogue consists of him partaking in a bunch of fun activities that you otherwise would not expect from these unfortunately-named destinations.\n\ncaption Rishi sliding into a freezing river at 4 degrees Celsius in Dull, Scotland. source Screengrab from YouTube / Unexpected Journeys\n\nHe also plays host to return the favour, pampering them with luxury seats on the Singapore Airlines.\n\ncaption Rishi\u2019s Scottish guests from Dull, wrestling in a Suites class seat on board the SIA. source Screengrab from YouTube / Unexpected Journeys\n\nAnd entertaining them with his shenanigans on the Forest Adventure.\n\ncaption source Screengrab from YouTube / Unexpected Journeys\n\nRishi makes sure to show off Singapore\u2019s cultural side as well, with a visit to Pulau Ubin\u2019s Cookery Magic.\n\ncaption Rishi getting scolded after failing his banana bowl. source Screengrab from YouTube / Unexpected Journeys\n\nAnd finally, parting ways with them.\n\ncaption Rishi saying goodbye to the Wilsons family from Bland, Australia. source Screengrab from YouTube / Unexpected Journeys\n\nRishi\u2019s travelogue involves him bringing his guests to many other areas of Singapore, with each episode shining the spotlight on Singapore\u2019s lesser-known side.\n\nAccording to a joint statement by the two brands, the aim of the film series is to help global audiences discover Singapore and showcase the \u201cdepth and breadth of Singapore and the distinctive experiences travellers can enjoy in the destination\u201d.\n\nSingapore Airlines senior vice president sales and marketing, Campbell Wilson, added that the series highlights Singapore\u2019s \u201cauthentic and meaningful experiences that are unforgettable and uniquely local\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s one of the videos in the series:\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - New film series \"Unexpected Journeys\" showcases Singapore in a different light..
