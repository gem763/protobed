Ong claimed she was feeling unwell and an ambulance was called. But students prevented the ambulance from leaving. Eventually a deputy principal took over, and promised more talks would be held at 1:30 pm.\n\nPolice ask Facebook to remove \u2018defamatory\u2019 posts on officers\u2019 handling of demonstrations\n\nStudents vandalised school facilities and a group of police armed with shotguns and batons appeared on campus. After a 10 minute stand off with students, officers left. Later, fire damage to the campus was discovered along with what was thought to be a Molotov cocktail.\n\nAt the Open University of Hong Kong, a planned closed-door dialogue session was turned to an open one with media allowed in after objections from students. Students appealed for support from the university, but got no answer, even after they knelt to beg President Wong Yuk-shan and his aides to condemn the police's handling of the protests. Their pleas fell on deaf ears and after about an hour, the students left.\n\nAt Polytechnic University today, a flash mob of fresh graduates wearing V for Vendetta masks and Winnie the Pooh costumes protested against university head Teng Jin-Guang's refusal to shake hands with two students who wore masks to their graduation ceremony on Sunday.\n\nReporter slams police \u2018brutality\u2019 after journalists injured, arrested at Sunday demonstrations in Yau Tsim Mong\n\nStudents waved banners and flags, sung the protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong and shouted slogans.\n\nAt Hong Kong University, students intercepted university President Zhang Xiang as he was leaving a meeting. They demanded a second public dialogue session after he had attended one on July 18. A petition for new talks and for Zhang to condemn alleged police brutality was signed by more than 2,600 students, alumni and staff.\n\nZhang promised to seriously consider the possibility, but would not make a solid committment. He left the scene, escorted to his car by security guards. Students chanted protest slogans and accused him of \"cowardice\" as he left.", "description": "Action included a flash mob featuring 'V for Vendetta' and demands to condemn the police", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/cb9840a2-fb04-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15imagehires190345.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
