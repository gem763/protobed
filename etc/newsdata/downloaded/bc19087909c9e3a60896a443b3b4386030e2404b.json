He has his own postseason experience as a player, of course, having delivered one of the Yankees\u2019 more memorable playoff moments with his walk-off home run in Game 7 of the 2003 A.L.C.S.\n\nNow, as manager, Boone was able to convince his Yankees that a comeback in the A.L.C.S. was still possible without making it sound like a mere clich\u00e9. He had been just as successful during the regular season instilling the next-man-up mantra when the Yankees were crippled by a run of injuries to some of their most important players.\n\n\u201cHe made us believe that everyone mattered, which made it easier to wait your turn,\u201d said the backup catcher Austin Romine. \u201cThe thing about Boonie is that he\u2019s the manager for all 25 guys, not just the stars. And not every manager can say that.\u201d\n\nBoone has not been perfect this postseason: He has maintained a stubborn loyalty to Gary Sanchez throughout the playoffs, even when the catcher\u2019s struggles with the bat and behind the plate have frustrated many fans. Boone has also been unwilling to demote reliever Adam Ottavino to lower-leverage situations, even after the right-hander had lost command of his signature slider and allowed crushing hits in the series.\n\nStill, Boone has nevertheless proved to be more relatable than his predecessor, Joe Girardi, who was let go after 10 years in the job. Then again, Girardi never suffered a losing season in the Bronx, and he remains the only Yankees manager to win a World Series after the 2000 season. For all the legitimacy Boone brings to the job, he knows the only currency that matters are those championships.\n\nThe Yankees\u2019 ability to adapt to all their setbacks this year \u2014 including setting a record for the most players to go on the injured list \u2014 will most likely earn Boone votes for Manager of the Year, despite the Yankees\u2019 wealth. No Yankees manager has won the award since Joe Torre in 1998, despite 12 division titles since then. Their performances are often dismissed with the cynical rejoinder: Who wouldn\u2019t win with that much talent?", "description": "After a Game 4 loss, the players thought they might be berated by Manager Aaron Boone.
