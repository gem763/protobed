Zealand in the Rugby World Cup semi-final AP\n\nSaracens scrum-half Ben Spencer arrived in Tokyo on Monday morning to replace the injured Willi Heinz, who has been forced out of the final with a hamstring injury that left him in tears following the final whistle at the International Stadium Yokohama last weekend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for Willi, he\u2019s been a great contributor, a very well-liked member of the squad and he was in tears in the dressing room,\u201d Jones added. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for him but he\u2019s now collected himself, he now knows he\u2019s got another role to play for us and he\u2019ll fulfil that role really well this week.\n\n\u201cBen has been in and around the squad consistently for the last couple of years so he knows the game, he knows the players. He is a fit guy and just fits in quite readily. We always said to those guys outside the 31 that they need to be ready, and he is ready to go.\n\n\u201cWe needed to make the decision fairly quickly so we decided to call on Ben, and it is just a great opportunity ahead of him. He has come into the squad and has got to learn a few new things. Willi will help him and Ben [Youngs] will help him with that too. The task ahead of him is no different to any other player. He has just got to learn a little bit more in the early part of the week and get himself physically and mentally ready.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s recovery this week from a bruising encounter against the All Blacks will be more important than ever before, given what is at stake this weekend against the Springboks. Jones\u2019s side do have the bonus of playing a game fewer than South Africa due to the typhoon-affected pool match against France, but the Australian is keen to ensure that the players are doing everything within their power to ensure they are in the best shape possible going into the final week of the tournament.\n\nThat includes giving them free rein to visit the traditional Japanese onsens, which he believes hold a secret key to getting his players into the right place mentally as well as physically, and upon being told that Manu Tuilagi claimed he \u201cemptied the tank\u201d at the weekend, Jones could not have been happier.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the most satisfying things I\u2019ve heard \u2013 that Manu emptied the tank, because that\u2019s what we wanted our players to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they should be at the end of the game \u2013 absolutely exhausted. The great thing about our players is that physically they are in fantastic condition, so their ability to recover is extraordinary.\n\n\u201cThey have also taken to the onsens in droves. It is a great way to recover. Think about how smart the Japanese are, 150 years ago each village had its own onsen which is the perfect recovery: hot, cold, some social interaction so you can relax, so it\u2019s perfect. Our players are better today than they were last week and I would hesitate to say that our training\u2019s going to be to a higher standard this week that it was last week. That\u2019s how good a condition we are in.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0boss Eddie Jones believes he will have all 31 players in his squad fit and available for the Rugby World Cup final, with Jonny May, Owen Farrell, Kyle Sinckler and Anthony Watson all expected to return to training on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/09/jonny-may.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
