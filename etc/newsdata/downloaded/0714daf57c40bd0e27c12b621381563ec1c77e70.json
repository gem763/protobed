In \u201cDeath by China,\u201d Vara is used to back up claims made in the book, such as accusations of currency manipulation against Beijing, and the allegation that China is deliberately harming Americans with dangerous consumer goods.\n\nNavarro\u2019s fiction was revealed by Australian academic Tessa Morris-Suzuki, a professor emeritus of Japanese history at the Australian National University, and first reported in the Chronicle Review earlier this week.\n\nBut when the trade adviser was confronted with these revelations, he didn\u2019t appear very contrite.\n\nHe told the website that Vara was a \u201cwhimsical device and pen name I\u2019ve used throughout the years for opinions and purely entertainment value, not as a source of fact.\u201d\n\nHe compared the Ron Vara character to \u201cAlfred Hitchcock appearing briefly in cameo in his movies,\" and said that it's \u201crefreshing that somebody finally figured out an inside joke that has been hiding in plain sight for years.\u201d\n\nNavarro\u2019s publisher Pearson was less amused,\n\n\u201cWe take any breaches of our [strict editorial] standards very seriously and take swift action when one is identified,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIn this case, we are amending our current inventory and all future reprints and editions to alert readers that this book contains a fictional character.\u201d\n\nNavarro, who was brought into the administration in 2016, remains one of the president\u2019s most trusted advisers on trade. The White House has yet to comment on Navarro\u2019s fabrications.\n\nCover: In this March 31, 2017 file photo, National Trade Council adviser Peter Navarro appears before President Donald Trump arrives to sign executive orders regarding trade in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington.
