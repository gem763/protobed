Depending on which one is stronger, some Android phones on Fi can use either T-Mobile, Sprint, or US Cellular. The feature is mainly used on Pixel phones, and now with the Pixel 4, Fi is taking advantage of that phone\u2019s Dual SIM Dual Standby (DSDS) feature.\n\nDSDS does pretty much what it says: two different SIM cards can be on \u201cstandby,\u201d aware of the state for their respective networks. The Pixel 4, like many modern phones, has a physical SIM slot and an eSIM. Typically, a user would have a different network on each SIM so that they could use one for data and another for calls.\n\nOn the Pixel 4, Google is putting both of those SIMs on the Fi network. That way, each can look for which one is strongest and switch to it on the fly without interrupting data. Pixel phones could switch between those networks before, but not quite this seamlessly.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean both networks are active at the same time, only that they are both on standby, so it shouldn\u2019t hit battery life. That\u2019s a relief because the Pixel 4 doesn\u2019t have much battery to spare.\n\nGoogle calls it \u201cdual connect,\u201d and though it\u2019s a small improvement over how the radios worked with Fi\u2019s network before, it\u2019s a smart one. To start, Google is only enabling the feature on phones purchased from the Google Store or via Google Fi. It is rolling the feature out as a software update \u201cover the next few weeks,\u201d and it intends to add it to other Fi devices \u201cover time.\u201d\n\nDevices that aren\u2019t explicitly Fi-compatible \u2014 like iPhones \u2014 won\u2019t be able to take advantage of the feature. Those phones end up just landing on T-Mobile\u2019s network in my experience.\n\nGoogle has experimented with lots of different features and plans for Fi. It started by offering a clear per-GB plan, but it eventually capitulated and added a more traditional (and more caveat-ridden) Unlimited plan last month. It also offers data SIMs at no additional cost, a free Google-hosted VPN for Android users, and no extra roaming fees on international data. Despite all of that, the service hasn\u2019t exactly taken off as a major competitor in the US.", "description": "Google\u2019s MVNO wireless service \u2014 Google Fi \u2014 has offered certain users a unique benefit: it can piggyback on multiple networks.
