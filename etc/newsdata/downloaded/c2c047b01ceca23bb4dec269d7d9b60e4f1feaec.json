As a youngster, he would spend 10 kilometres a day walking to school,\" said Stick.\n\nStick said coaches in rural areas where Mapimpi played his early rugby would expel you from the pitch for kicking the ball away so he was rarely exposed to an aerial game.\n\nThe coach said he still has \"room for improvement\" but has developed as a player.\n\n\"It's a nice story to tell to youngsters that irrespective of your background, if you really work hard, and your opportunity comes, you need to be ready.\"\n\nWhatever happens this weekend, a South Africa defeat may not be something Mapimpi describes as a \"tragedy\" given the 29-year-old has already lost his mother, sister and brother.\n\nHis mother Eunice, who ran a sewing business, died in a car accident while Mapimpi's sister, Zukiswa, was a nurse who succumbed to a brain illness.\n\nZolani, his brother, lost a leg after being electrocuted while stealing electricity cables. He died after failing to recover from his injuries.\n\nIn an interview with South African website New Frame published last week, Mapimpi said he would not be Japan if his mother and sister were alive.\n\n\"Both were opposed to me playing rugby because they felt I wouldn't gain anything from it, so they would have insisted that I get an education or a job.\"\n\nHe added: \"Obviously, I'm not saying it's a good thing they're not here. But their absence has toughened me up to be here and left me feeling like my presence here is God's plan.\"\n\nKick-off on Sunday is at 11:00 (SA time).", "description": "Springbok wing Makazole Mapimpi's rugby journey started in a poor rural area, passed through family tragedy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7885/90a3bdbea2004f049cf9312c0e73d68b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
