Chiefs head coach Andy Reid told reporters Friday that his quarterback is \u201cclose\u201d to being able to play.\n\n\u201cHe just wasn\u2019t ready right now,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThat was our decision, not his. He wanted to play right after it happened. He just needs a little bit of time here.\u201d\n\nWhen Mahomes suffered the dislocated right kneecap, a member of the Chiefs\u2019 training staff appeared to pop his knee into place. The initial belief was the reigning NFL MVP would miss at least three weeks due to the injury.\n\nThe team received positive news after an MRI, and Mahomes was able to participate on a limited basis. Earlier in the week, Reid wouldn\u2019t rule his signal-caller out and expressed optimism about the injury.\n\n\u201cIt was the best possible result, and I just kind of program in the way he rolls,\u201d Reid said. \u201c[Athletic trainer Rick Burkholder] does a good job of managing those [injured] guys so they\u2019re not doing too much or not enough. \u2026 I trust them to do their job.\n\n\u201cAfter it happened, [Mahomes] thought he could go back in. That\u2019s how he\u2019s wired. He\u2019s wired a little different that way. \u2026 He attacks everything. That\u2019s how he goes about it. He\u2019s been full steam ahead.\u201d\n\nDespite the positive outlook, Mahomes is out and backup quarterback Matt Moore will make his first start since Week 11 of the 2017 season when he played for the Miami Dolphins. Undrafted rookie Kyle Shurmur will be the backup to Moore.\n\nThrough seven games this season, Mahomes has completed 157-of-241 passes for a league-best 2,180 yards, with 15 touchdowns and one interception.", "description": "Oct. 25 (UPI) \u2014 The Kansas City Chiefs will be without star quarterback Patrick Mahomes for Sunday\u2019s key matchup against Aaron Rodgers and the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
