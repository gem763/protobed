The two flight engineers are scheduled to switch their spacesuits to battery power and exit the International Space Station just before 8 a.m. ET Friday.\n\nThe spacewalk will be broadcast online by NASA TV, with coverage starting at 6:30 a.m. ET.\n\nOnce outside of the Quest airlock, the space station\u2019s robotic arm will help the duo get to the far side of ISS. The duo will then walk to their work site on the end of the Port 6 truss structure. During the 5.5-hour mission, Koch and Meir will replace a broken power controller, also known as a battery charge-discharge unit, or BCDU, with a working spare.\n\n\u201cThe BCDU regulates the charge to the batteries that collect and distribute solar power to the orbiting lab\u2019s systems,\u201d according to a recent update from NASA.\n\nScientists first realized the power controller had failed while trying to integrate one of their newly installed lithium ion batteries into one of the power system\u2019s channels. The hiccup marked the second time a power controller is given out shortly after the installation of a new lithium ion battery.\n\nOver the last year, most extravehicular activities have involved battery swaps. One by one, NASA astronauts detached older batteries and replaced them with newer, more efficient lithium ion batteries. But after the most recent glitch, NASA officials decided to temporarily postpone all battery work.\n\nKoch and Meir were originally supposed to make history later this month. They were scheduled to perform, surprise, battery work on Oct. 21. Instead, they\u2019ll be doing electrical repairs and helping NASA engineers figure out why two power controllers failed in such a short amount of time.\n\n\u201cWhen you have one failure you go oh that\u2019s interesting, but when you have two you stop and think about it,\u201d Kenny Todd, manager of International Space Station Operations Integration, told reporters during a teleconference on Tuesday.\n\nOnce NASA engineers and their partners on the space station get to the bottom of the BCDU glitch, battery replacement work will resume.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, the five planned spacewalks to repair a cosmic particle detector, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, are still on the calendar for November and December,\u201d NASA reported.\n\nDespite the historic nature of the Friday morning\u2019s spacewalk, Meir and Koch told reporters they\u2019re focused on the details of the mission.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now shows all that work went into it to get us where we are today,\u201d astronaut Meir told reporters earlier this month. \u201cAnd the nice thing about it for us is that we don\u2019t really think about it on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\n\nStill, the duo said they\u2019re aware of the spacewalk\u2019s historical and symbolic importance.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people that derive motivation from inspiring stories about people that look like them, and I think that is an important aspect of the story to tell,\u201d Koch said.", "description": "Oct. 18 (UPI) \u2014 NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir are preparing to embark on a historic spacewalk, the first featuring two women.
