Thorpe worked as a Delta Airlines baggage handler who authorities believe swiped a bag full of cash before it was supposed to be loaded onto a flight to Miami.\n\nUNITED AIRLINES FLIGHT MAKES EMERGENCY LANDING AFTER PASSENGER GETS STUCK IN BATHROOM\n\n\"We are taking this situation very seriously and working directly with authorities on their investigation, as well as conducting an internal investigation of our own,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nOkon is not employed by the airline but is accused of helping Thorpe.\n\nThe money was supposed to be part of a shipment of eight bags on Delta Flight 1225, prosecutors said.\n\nSecurity surveillance showed Thorpe allegedly scanning and loading bags onto the flight but not scanning the stolen bag, authorities said. He placed it in a container and drove off in a work vehicle, they said.\n\nThe missing money was detected when the plane landed in Florida and a member of the armored car security team noticed the bag count was off.\n\nCourt documents said Okon used his domestic partner's Nissan to drive to JFK and pick up the stolen bag of cash from Thorpe.\n\nInvestigators found the car Sunday and conducted a search. An envelope containing the flight's manifest was found. Co-workers told investigators Thorpe went home sick around the time of the alleged theft.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"In my mind there's a question of how is the money actually taken out of the airport? If there are surveillance cameras all around, that's a question that needs to be answered going forward, but we'll see what the government wants to do with it,\" Thorpe's attorney told the station.\n\nOkon was released from police custody on $80,000 bond. The missing money has not been recovered.\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department and the FBI are investigating\n\nFox News reporters Melissa Leon and Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.", "description": "A second man has been arrested in connection with\u00a0the theft of $300,000 from a Florida-bound flight from\u00a0New York's John F.
