Anthony Junco, a spokesman for the Navy\u2019s 7th Fleet, told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cThe most recent dual-carrier operations in South China Sea we could find record of was conducted on 17 August, 2001 and included the aircraft carriers USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) and the now decommissioned USS Constellation (CV 64),\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. naval and Marine forces conducted \u201cjoint, high-end warfighting exercises,\u201d including with live fire, to \u201cincrease battle readiness,\u201d according to an official Navy report on the recent operations.\n\nSpecifically, the Navy and Marine teams practiced \u201cmaritime strike operations, search and rescue operations, fast attack craft defense, maritime interdiction operations, small arms and crew-served weapons live-fire drills, air defense and anti-submarine warfare operations.\u201d\n\nAlthough China was not named, the Navy commander in charge of the operations alluded to deterring those who challenge U.S. and allied values.\n\n\u201cOur operations in the Indo-Pacific are focused on maintaining regional stability and security,\u201d Rear Adm. George Wikoff, commander, Task Force 70, said in the Navy\u2019s report. He added:\n\nOur presence reflects our commitment to the values we share with the many partners and allies in the region, and we stand prepared to deter those who challenge these mutual values with the overwhelming force of our combined carrier and amphibious strike groups.\n\nNavy Rear Adm. Fred Kacher, commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 7, said the \u201cflexibility of our forces in the Indo-Pacific is a key to our lethality.\u201d\n\nKacher said in the Navy report:\n\nOur ability to join together the incredible capability of a carrier strike group, combine it with the expeditionary combat power of our Navy-Marine Corps team, and then integrate with our extensive network of allies and partners provides us a true competitive advantage.\n\nThe U.S. Navy has conducted dual-ship operations in the South China Sea before, but with smaller ships. In 2015, the littoral combat ship USS Fort Worth partnered with the destroyer USS Lassen for presence operations in the South China Sea, according to the Navy.\n\nThe recent South China Sea operations took place as Assistant Secretary of Defense Randy Schriver visited the region last week, first going to China, then Vietnam, and then Japan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important and consequential time in the region and what we\u2019re trying to do to compete effectively with China,\u201d he said Tuesday at the Jamestown Foundation\u2019s ninth annual China Defense and Security Conference.\n\n\u201cThe United States is of course a Pacific nation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for some people, I think you need a little reminding that we are a Pacific nation.\u201d\n\nThe operations also occurred as the U.S. and China square off in various arenas. President Trump has made good on his campaign promise to get tough with China on its unfair trade practices with the U.S., including theft and forced transfers of U.S. intellectual property.\n\nThe Trump administration has also made China and Russia the focus of its national security strategy versus the Middle East. It has stepped up U.S. naval patrols in the South China Sea, including around land features China has built into islands and placed military equipment on \u2014 which violated a promise the Chinese president made to former President Barack Obama in 2015.\n\nThe Obama administration had stopped those patrols in the South China Sea between 2012 and 2015 out of concern of upsetting Beijing. But one of the first things the Trump Pentagon did in office was to lay out a plan for recurring patrols near the contested land features, known as freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs), as reported first by Breitbart News.\n\nThe administration also began to publicly announce patrols through the Taiwan Strait, for the first time in about a decade, as also reported first by Breitbart News.\n\nHowever, there is still ample concern over China\u2019s rapidly expanding naval fleet and its increasing aggressiveness in the South China Sea, which approximately 30 percent of international trade passes through.\n\n\u201cToday, China has the second-most capable blue water fleet in the world in terms of modern warships,\u201d said retired Navy Rear Adm. Michael McDevitt, currently a senior fellow at the Center for Naval Analyses.\n\nHe said China currently has on a day-to-day basis about 270 ships that can shoot missiles or torpedos. The U.S. Navy\u2019s 7th Fleet, which is forward deployed in the region, has between 19 and 27 such ships, he said. \u201cJust in ship firepower, the Chinese have serious overmatch,\u201d he said.\n\nHe predicted China\u2019s blue water navy would have around 400 ships by 2035, if it expands at the same rate it has in the past 15 years. In contrast, the U.S. plans to have 355 ships by 2034, he said.\n\n\u201cChina is on the way to a world class Navy, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe maritime issues [are] going to be a major facet in our broad systemic rivalry with China \u2014 a rivalry that I believe is here for the very long term.\u201d\n\nSchriver said China has been trying to rebrand its activities in the region, but its behavior and activities are still \u201cquite robust and of concern to us.\u201d He said:\n\nFor example, the incursions into the Vietnamese [Exclusive Economic Zone]. In Japan, they talk about an improving relationship\u2026but in fact the same level of activity is occurring in and around the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea \u2014 the same naval and maritime militia and coast guard activities into Japanese territorial waters.\n\n\u201cSo I think the rebranding is underway but the activities and the behavior is still of concern to us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s recent South China Sea operations were publicized in a tweet from its official twitter account, and its chief spokesman, Adm. Charlie Brown, retweeted it, along with a message.\n\n\u201cWe stand prepared to deter those who challenge these mutual values with the overwhelming force of our combined carrier and amphibious strike groups,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nHe later told Breitbart News: \u201cWe don\u2019t often have two big decks in the same area to train together, so it\u2019s noteworthy when we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stand prepared to deter those who challenge these mutual values with the overwhelming force of our combined carrier and amphibious strike groups.\u201d https://t.co/rcr3KYZv6M \u2014 Navy Chief of Information (@chinfo) October 6, 2019\n\nThe recent operations were not considered FONOPs, since the U.S. ships did not sail through waters within 12-nautical miles of a nation\u2019s shore.\n\nThe Reagan Carrier Strike Group includes the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76), \u201cAmerica\u2019s Flagship,\u201d the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5, Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruisers, and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers from Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 15.\n\nThe Boxer Amphibious Ready Group includes the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer (LHD 4), \u201cAmerica\u2019s Golden Gator,\u201d a San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship, a Harpers Ferry-class amphibious dock landing ship, and the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU).\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "The Navy recently sent an aircraft carrier strike group and an amphibious ready group into the South China Sea, apparently for the first time", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/US-Navy-South-China-Sea-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
