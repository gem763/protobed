REUTERS/Amit Dave/File Photo\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Protests by workers at Coal India Ltd on Tuesday hit output by about 56%, a senior company official told Reuters.\n\nThe workers\u2019 strike over implementation of reforms including allowing 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in coal mining - which India approved last month to attract global miners to India - paralysed operations.\n\nThe company, which accounts for over four-fifths of India\u2019s coal output and employs about 300,000 people, registered a 30% attendance due to the strike. India depends on coal-based utilities for three-quarters of its electricity generation.\n\nCoal India produced a total of 466,000 tonnes of coal on Tuesday, which compared to an business-as-usual production estimate of 1.05 million tonnes, the official said.", "description": "Protests by workers at Coal India Ltd on Tuesday hit output by about 56%, a senior company official told Reuters.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433703688&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0N5", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
