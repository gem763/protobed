The supplier gets to choose exactly when it wants to be paid the full amount of money it is owed, with payment dates as soon as 10 days after goods and services are delivered.\n\nThe higher the credit rating of the big company initiating the early payment scheme, the lower the fees charged to suppliers and the more confidence banks and financiers have that they can collect the monies owed.\n\nBig companies like construction group CIMIC - which has been delaying payments to suppliers by at least 65 days - and Telstra use supply chain financing because it can allow them to stretch out formal payment terms to suppliers by giving the supplier the option to get paid earlier. The risk is that they may abuse their bargaining power.\n\nWhile supply chain finance can be a legitimate tool for helping small companies get paid on time, Ms Carnell said it was \"totally unacceptable\" for big businesses to use the schemes as a replacement for reasonable payment terms of 30 days or less from invoice.\n\n\u201cThis review will provide a clearer picture on the range of supply chain finance options available on the market and which industries are using these products,\" she said.\n\nA \"significant number\" of small businesses had contacted the ombudsman\u2019s office in relation to supply chain financing issues, Ms Carnell said.\n\nSmall businesses and family enterprises who have had experience with supply chain financing have been urged to contribute to the review.\n\nAn interim report is expected to be released in March 2020, followed by a full report by the end of April 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConcerns over the increasing use of supply chain financing schemes is rising globally. A letter sent to the US's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in early October from the big four accounting firms said that while typical payment terms with suppliers historically might have been 60 to 90 days, some entities are now trying to negotiate payment terms with suppliers of up to 180, 210, or even 364 days.\n\nThe big four pointed out that because there are no specific disclosure requirements under US accounting regulations, there has been limited disclosure of supply chain financing schemes.\n\nThey have asked the FASB to require more disclosure to increase the schemes' transparency and clarify whether the owed invoices should be classified as trade payables or debt.\n\nUnder current accounting regulations in Australia and internationally, companies do not have to report the owed invoices as debt on their balance sheet and can instead account for them under trade payables, boosting cash flows.", "description": "The ombudsman will review if companies are using financing schemes to manipulate working capital and cash reserves.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2032%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_53%2C$y_76/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/12fb299b918645c5b39fd0ee00b93a0cf75769fd", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
