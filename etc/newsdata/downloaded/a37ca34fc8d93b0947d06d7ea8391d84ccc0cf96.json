Chris Christie and his wife, Mary Pat, had lofty goals when it launched in January, boasting of plans to raise as much as $250 million for real estate deals in federally designated opportunity zones.\n\nBut 10 months later, the fund has failed to attract much interest, raising just $29 million as of Oct. 7, according to SEC filings.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd the chief of a financial firm tapped to help draw investors said the Christies\u2018 involvement hasn't been much of a factor in the fundraising efforts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s been been [a] positive or negative,\" David Goss of UOB Global Capital said in an interview, downplaying the impact of the former governor.\n\nThe tepid response to the investment fund, called the Hampshire Christie Qualified Opportunity Fund, reflects the limited reach of the one-time Republican powerhouse in a new field of real estate investing that\u2019s attracted hordes of private offerings but a relatively limited number of investable opportunities.\n\nThe fundraising so far suggests it will take Hampshire Companies several years to raise the $250 million it had sought when it first launched the vehicle in January.\n\nSubsequent reports pegged the fund\u2019s investment target as low as $100 million or $150 million. Even so, Hampshire Companies \u2014 a Morristown-based real estate investment and development firm led by longtime Christie allies Jon Hanson and James Hanson II \u2014 has brought in two brokerage firms to help draw investors to the investment vehicle.\n\nMary Pat Christie, who previously worked at the private equity firm Angelo Gordon, is an executive vice president on the fund tasked with fundraising. The former governor is acting as an adviser.\n\nEarlier this summer, Mary Pat Christie told Barron\u2019s that her husband would likely help the fund secure the necessary approvals from local governments and agencies in future deals.\n\n\u201cTo be connected to the town and the mayor and the town councils and the zoning board, all those things are really, really important,\u201d she said. \u201cWho knows New Jersey better than my husband? That is why we\u2019re focused on New Jersey. We have a property in Connecticut, but we\u2019re focused on the I-95 corridor.\u201d\n\nThe former New Jersey governor has dipped his toe into several ventures since leaving office in early 2018, having joined the board of an addiction treatment facility in Florida and opened an independent law firm. Last month, POLITICO was first to report that Christie had inked an $800,000 consulting deal with Pacira BioSciences, plus stock options, in 2018 and 2019 as it lobbied for new Medicare rates to boost the financial prospects of its flagship product, a non-opioid painkiller used in surgeries.\n\nInvestors have been \"generally receptive. It was ... a hot commodity. But the temperature\u2019s cooled a little bit so [now] it\u2019s a normal commodity,\u201d said Goss, whose firm has been tapped by Hampshire to assist with fundraising in California, Florida and New York.\n\nHampshire Companies President and CEO James Hanson II declined to comment on the fundraising or Christie\u2019s role. But statements provided to both the Wall Street Journal and Barron's earlier this year suggest the former governor\u2019s involvement was expected to provide a boost to the firm's newest investment strategy.\n\n\"Both Chris and Mary Pat had information with regard to these qualified opportunity zones, and together we said this might be a great opportunity to work together,\" Hanson II told The Wall Street Journal. A subsequent interview with Barron's suggested the firm's partnership with the Christies would \u201chelp us tap into additional private investor sources through the relationships they have.\u201d\n\nChristie did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe fund\u2019s investor pool includes around 60 people or entities, according to SEC filings. The minimum commitment to the fund is $500,000.\n\nWith $29 million of capital available for investment, Hampshire Companies has largely directed the money toward projects that had already been in its development pipeline, according to reports. That includes 150 River St. in Hackensack \u2014 the former home of the Record newspaper \u2014 as well as another plot in Hackensack that once housed the Arena Diner.\n\nAnother investment in a self-storage facility located in New London, Conn., is also in the works.\n\n\u201cTo be connected to the town and the mayor and the town councils and the zoning board, all those things are really, really important,\u201d Mary Pat Christie told Barron\u2019s earlier this year. \u201cWho knows New Jersey better than my husband? That is why we\u2019re focused on New Jersey. We have a property in Connecticut, but we\u2019re focused on the I-95 corridor.\u201d\n\nOpportunity zone funds are a relatively new phenomena, having been created through Republican-backed tax reform legislation in 2017. In exchange for reinvesting capital gains in real estate projects within economically distressed communities, investors could defer or eliminate some of their tax obligations.\n\nPrivate investment firms, seizing on a strategy that would represent a potential tax windfall for wealthy families and individuals, launched massive funds \u2014 as much as $5 billion, in the case of real estate behemoth CIM Group \u2014 despite a comparative dearth of shovel-ready building projects.\n\nInvestors have responded in kind. A recent report from real estate data provider CoStar found that of the $15.46 billion being sought by funds launched in 2019 just $1.46 billion had been raised through the end of June.\n\nGoss, whose firm has a long relationship with Hampshire, said opportunity zone funds haven\u2019t been helped by the fact that tax benefits granted to opportunity zone investors don\u2019t apply to major institutions like public pension systems or nonprofit foundations and endowments \u2014 the traditional backers of large private equity and investment vehicles.\n\nSome of the tax benefits for high-net worth individuals will expire at the end of this year, which doesn\u2019t bode well for Hampshire\u2019s odds at hitting the $250 million target listed on its most recent SEC filings.", "description": "Subsequent reports pegged the fund\u2019s investment target as low as $100 million or $150 million.", "authors": ["Sam Sutton"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bc/a7/9e4e6c0344579fe055d1f3104422/170217-chris-mary-pat-christie-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
