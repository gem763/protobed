Save me the time', he threatened. 'I will win but it will take a ton of time'.\n\n'Don't f**k with our timing', Apatow added bluntly.\n\nNetflix is selectively trying out the feature on Android mobile phones, allowing users to speed through episodes of programming, or films and documentaries on the site, reports Android Police.\n\nAs binge-watchers of streaming media are hard-pressed to keep up with the latest shows, the feature would allow for the consumption of more media, and in less time.\n\nNetflix wouldn't be the first site to give viewers the option to change speeds of the videos they watch.\n\nUsers on YouTube have been able for years to accelerate a broadcast, including its audio, by increments of 25 per cent to 100 per cent.\n\nAndroid Police's report on the Netflix feature includes a screenshot of the variable speeds set at 1.25 and 1.50 times faster, as well as 0.25 and 0.50 times slower, during a streaming broadcast of 'The Standups', a series directed by comedian Troy Miller, featuring standup comics.\n\nIt's not clear if the content used to demonstrate the variable playback speed feature was what initially caught Apatow's attention. His Tweet references a story from another news outlet that references the original piece posted online by Android Police.\n\nNetflix confirmed it was testing the new feature.\n\n'We're always experimenting with new ways to help members use Netflix', said the streaming service in a statement to Android Police. 'This test makes it possible to vary the speed at which people watch shows on their mobiles'.\n\nAs with any test, it may not become a permanent feature on Netflix', the site added.\n\nIf the feature is made available to all Netflix subscribers, it means they will be able to speed through popular programs, including 'Breaking Bad', 'House of Cards', 'Stranger Things', 'Orange is the New Black', 'Bojack Horseman' and its new show, 'The Politician'.\n\nApatow's tweet reminds Netflix why he wants such a feature stopped.\n\n'We give you nice things', he writes. 'Leave them as they were intended to be seen'.", "description": "Comedian, director and producer Judd Apatow has taken issue with a feature being tested out by Netflix that allows viewers to binge watch programs faster, as is already featured on other sites.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
