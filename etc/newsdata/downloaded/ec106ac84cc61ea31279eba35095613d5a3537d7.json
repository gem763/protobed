Especially with Romney as the anti-Trump alternative. He\u2019s beloved in Utah but last I checked he wasn\u2019t popular within the GOP. No doubt he\u2019s less popular today, now that he\u2019s picked up his criticism of the president.\n\nBut a story doesn\u2019t need to be true for it to be eminently readable. If you\u2019re a left-winger or a Never Trump righty, rumors of Romney plotting some sort of GOP rebellion against Trump are irresistible fanfic. Whereas if you\u2019re a Trump fan, rumors of Romney plotting some sort of GOP rebellion against Trump are irresistible hate-read material. \u201cThe adults in the room are going to finally stop Trump!\u201d \u201cThe RINOs are plotting a coup against the president!\u201d\n\nFor the record, Romney isn\u2019t going to bring down the Trump presidency during a Senate impeachment trial. They won\u2019t get close to 67 votes to remove. But he might be able to persuade three colleagues to vote that way, which would give the Senate a clear majority in favor. (Unless Joe Manchin gets cold feet, of course.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a real increase in nervousness over the past three or four weeks,\u201d a prominent GOP member told me. \u201cEverybody sees what Trump did as such a clear abuse of power,\u201d said another prominent Republican. \u201cWhether it\u2019s criminal or not is another issue. But it\u2019s so blatantly over the line.\u201d\u2026 In the Senate, Ben Sasse and Susan Collins have made their usual equivocal noises\u2014but not surprisingly, its Mitt Romney, longtime Trump antagonist and sometime suck-up, who\u2019s become the standard-bearer, leading to questions as to what his game is. According to sources, donors have in recent days called the Utah senator and encouraged him to run against Trump in the primary. \u201cThere is a half-billion dollars on the sidelines from guys who are fed up with Trump,\u201d a GOP donor told me\u2026 According to people close to Romney, he\u2019s firmly decided against primarying Trump, an enterprise he believes to be a sure loser given Trump\u2019s enduring GOP support. Romney has also told people that, as an unsuccessful two-time presidential candidate, he\u2019s the wrong person to take on Trump. Instead, a Romney adviser told me, Romney believes he has more potential power as a senator who will decide Trump\u2019s fate in an impeachment trial. \u201cHe could have tremendous influence in the impeachment process as the lone voice of conscience in the Republican caucus,\u201d the adviser said. In recent days, Romney has been reaching out privately to key players in the Republican resistance, according to a person briefed on the conversations. \u201cRomney is the one guy who could bring along Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Ben Sasse. Romney is the pressure point in the impeachment process. That\u2019s why the things he\u2019s saying are freaking Republicans out.\u201d\n\nCollins, Gardner, and Sasse? They\u2019re all running for reelection next year! Voting with Democrats to remove Trump would lead to them either getting bounced in a primary or shellacked in the general election when pro-Trump Republicans stayed home in protest. If Romney really is targeting people to rebel, he\u2019s better off with someone like Rubio, who\u2019s stayed far away from confronting Trump thus far but who\u2019s also pretty clearly miserable in the Senate and whose presidential prospects are long gone in a post-Trump GOP. He\u2019s not up for reelection until 2022 either so he\u2019d have a little time to either try to repair relations with the party later or to announcement his retirement long before the next primary starts shaping up. Remember, he was prepared to retire in 2016 before he got talked out of it.\n\nIf Romney\u2019s looking for more nothing-to-lose votes, he could try fellow Utahn Mike Lee. Lee\u2019s not up until 2022 either and anti-Trump Republicans are safer in Utah than they are in any other red state. Romney could even pledge to campaign for Lee to try to help him save his seat. One more possibility: Richard Burr, the senator from North Carolina who\u2019s spent the duration of Trump\u2019s presidency chairing the Senate Intelligence Committee. Importantly, Burr has said before that this would be his final term in the Senate. He has nothing to lose by crossing Trump, which may help explain why his committee\u2019s investigation of Russiagate was more bipartisan and independent than its counterpart in the House.\n\nRomney, Rubio, Lee, and Burr would mean 51 votes for impeachment, or 50 if Manchin balks. Plus, there\u2019s always Murkowski!\n\nNah, I\u2019m just kidding. Rubio wouldn\u2019t have the nerve to vote to remove, even if he has little to lose at this point by doing so. Mike Lee circa 2016 would vote to remove but Mike Lee circa 2019 is pretty friendly with Trump and remains on the SCOTUS shortlist. Burr keeps a low profile and seems to like it that way, which makes an earth-shaking vote against Trump seem unlikely. I think Dems might get Romney and Murkowski and that\u2019s probably it barring some explosive new evidence confirming Trump\u2019s hand in a quid pro quo with Ukraine. The \u201cremove\u201d faction won\u2019t even reach 50 votes, especially considering that the \u201cbad but not impeachable\u201d get-out-of-jail-free card is always available.\n\nExit question: What if the punchline to all this Trump/Romney drama is that Romney ends up voting against removal?", "description": "\u201cThere is a half-billion dollars on the sidelines from guys who are fed up with Trump.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/r-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
