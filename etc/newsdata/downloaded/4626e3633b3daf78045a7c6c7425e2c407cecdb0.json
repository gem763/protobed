It became known as the cash for ash scandal.\n\n\u201cThe litany of incompetence and irresponsibility at political and official level disclosed to date in the inquiry into the cash for ash scandal in Northern Ireland is breathtaking,\u201d the Irish Times wrote in an editorial about the scandal in 2018.\n\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster, from the DUP, had been in charge of the department that developed the programme but she refused to resign her government post when the scandal emerged.\n\nInstead, McGuinness quit, writing in his resignation letter that the minister responsible for the renewable energy scheme had \u201cno place\u201d in the executive.\n\nBut, he added, throughout his ten years in office, he had several disagreements with the DUP.\n\n\u201cApart from the negative attitude to nationalism and to the Irish identity and culture, there has been a shameful disrespect towards many other sections of our community. Women, the LGBT community and ethnic minorities have all felt this prejudice. And for those who wish to live their lives through the medium of Irish, elements in the DUP have exhibited the most crude and crass bigotry,\u201d McGuinness wrote in the letter.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in, McGuinness' nationalist party that shared power with the DUP, refused to appoint another minister, resulting in an election. But after the election, the parties still failed to come to an agreement on a number of issues including the restoration of the Irish language as the spoken language in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"If some of the difficult issues are out of the way there might be Irish language Act to return to the table,\" Dr Elodie Fabre, a politics lecturer at Queen's University Belfast, told Euronews.\n\nRead more about the collapse of Northern Ireland\u2019s government here.\n\nA partially open government\n\nAttempts to bridge the gap between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in have failed, and 1,000 days on, many do not see anything changing anytime soon.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly is still open and members receive partial pay. Member salaries were \u00a349,000 (\u20ac56,225) in April 2016, but are now \u00a335,888 (\u20ac41,180).\n\nIn the time since the government has been collapsed, Northern Ireland has spent more than \u00a310 million (\u20ac11.5 million) on member salaries.\n\nBut the government is partially run by the UK's parliament in Westminster, which has voted to pass a budget in Northern Ireland. This makes it different from other European countries which have gone months without a government.\n\nThe UK government also passed a law in July that states that provided there is still no government in Northern Ireland come October 21st, same-sex marriage will be legalised and abortion will be decriminalised. DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in had disagreed on both topics.\n\nGovernment divisions were highlighted by the murder of journalist Lyra McKee by the paramilitary group called the \"New IRA\" in Creggan, Derry in March. In August, a police chief said that deadlock in Stormont is enabling terrorism after a bomb attack in County Fermanagh near the border with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nHow has this impacted Brexit?\n\nTheresa May signed a deal with the DUP in 2017 as the Conservatives did not have a parliamentary majority.\n\n\u201cThis lack of parliamentary majority forced the Conservative Party to really follow what the DUP was saying which provided them with a veto,\u201d said Fabre.\n\nThe DUP has vehemently opposed the Irish backstop, a sort of insurance policy designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBut the government situation is also likely to be affected by Brexit down the road.\n\n\u201cIf there is a Brexit deal and there is no return of the institutions, it is quite likely that we will end up in a situation of direct rule [from London], because so much legislation needs to be passed in relation to Brexit in all sorts of policy areas, that direct rule would make sense,\u201d Fabre said.\n\nRead more:\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?\n\nBrexit: what is the Irish backstop and why does Boris Johnson want it ditched?", "description": "The Northern Ireland Executive collapsed on January 16th, 2017.", "authors": ["Lauren Chadwick"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/47/18/1000x563_cmsv2_18f577d9-42a5-5d55-a649-87152730436c-4224718.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
