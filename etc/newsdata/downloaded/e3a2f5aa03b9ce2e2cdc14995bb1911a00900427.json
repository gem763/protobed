She\u2019ll inspire people to vote because they\u2019re inspired by people who stand tall for their beliefs and are willing to fight for them. Voters are inspired by her passion, her grasp of the problems they face, her ability to formulate clear, understandable solutions and her willingness to stand up for progressive values.\n\n\u25baIn 2020, being a woman is a political asset. It promises to be the year that women strike back.\n\nWomen are overwhelmingly disgusted by Trump. They\u2019re disgusted by his sexism, lack of empathy, macho blustering and crude disrespectful language. They\u2019re disgusted when they see children ripped from mothers\u2019 arms at the border. They\u2019re furious that he\u2019s placing anti-abortion justices on the Supreme Court.\n\nWomen are mobilized like never before in American politics. A woman heading the ticket gives American women one more reason to work their hearts out and turn out in record numbers next fall.", "description": "", "authors": ["Robert Creamer", "Usatoday.Com Story Opinion"], "top_image": ""}
