We thought we had a bit of an advantage in that and we just executed our plan.\u201d\n\nIreland led 12-3 thanks to two early tries from Rob Kearney and Garry Ringrose but were ultimately made to look a shadow of the team that ploughed through Scotland six days ago, leaving coach Joe Schmidt\u2019s World Cup plans in jeopardy.\n\nLeft clinging on to what may prove a crucial losing bonus point, Ireland, however, are still well-placed to qualify and could still top Pool A if Japan fail to beat Scotland but their hopes of reaching a first semi-final look a lot less credible.\n\n\u201cWe played well in the first quarter and then we stopped playing,\u201d a rueful Schmidt said, insisting that the Japanese had not exceeded his expectations but, unfortunately, merely met them.\n\n\u201cThe strength of the team will be how they respond and how they rebound from this,\u201d he added.\n\nEXTRAORDINARY EFFORT\n\nThe hosts, who had never beaten Ireland before, admitted that their nerves got the better of them in the uneven 30-10 curtain-raising win over Russia and they duly came flying out of the blocks against the Johnny Sexton-less Irish.\n\nIreland\u2019s gameplan of attacking off the kind of forward pressure that smashed the Scots and testing the Japanese with third-choice flyhalf Jack Carty\u2019s clever array of kicks paid dividends, with Ringrose and Kearney claiming first-quarter tries.\n\nTamura knocked over a penalty in between and Japan already looked like they had Ireland in their sights by the time he cut the deficit again with a second penalty.\n\nWith five minutes to go to the break the Irish threatened again, for what would prove to be the final meaningful time of the game, with an attacking scrum against their lighter opponents.\n\nThe Japanese pack, however, responded with an extraordinary effort, destroying a full-strength Irish eight unchanged from the Scottish game at the put-in and driving them backwards before winning a penalty.\n\nThe crowd rose, producing a huge roar which was matched by the players, prop Jiwon Koo and hooker Shota Horie screaming at the top of their voices. A potential 19-6 Irish halftime lead turned into just a 12-9 advantage as an exhausted-looking Irish defence looked happy to hear the halftime whistle.\n\nJapan, who had never got within 16 points in seven previous defeats to Ireland, were back at it after the break with more high-tempo attacking play and Ireland were hanging on as their penalty count inched up.\n\nUtterly undone, Schmidt\u2019s men were making uncharacteristic simple errors and Fukuoka, a last-minute addition to the bench after an injury to Will Tupou, sensationally gave Japan the lead with 20 minutes to go and Tamura slotted over his most difficult kick of the night to make it 16-12.\n\nIreland simply had no answer to the relentless Japanese defence, led by lock James Moore who made 23 tackles without missing one.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nWith the home fans getting louder and louder, Tamura extended the lead to seven points eight minutes from time and there was no hanging back for Japan as they finished the game deep in the Irish half to reach an all-time high of eighth in the world rankings.\n\n\u201cThank you for today!\u201d Japan hooker Shota Horie said to the crowd after being named man of the match. \u201cThanks to your cheers, I was able to run to the last centimetre, the last millimetre.", "description": "The Rugby World Cup exploded into life on Saturday as Japan stunned Ireland 19-12 in an extraordinary upset that handed the exuberant hosts the result they had dreamed of and allowed their fans to embrace the first tournament ever staged on Asian soil.", "authors": ["Padraic Halpin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434833860&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R088", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
