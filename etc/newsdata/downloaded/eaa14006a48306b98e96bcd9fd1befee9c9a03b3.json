But Congress has no jail. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nHouse Democrats are so frustrated with President Trump\u2019s administration and his allies blocking their investigative efforts that some have seriously encouraged invoking a long-dormant power Congress has to jail or fine uncooperative witnesses. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the lawmaker leading the impeachment inquiry, indicated some support for the idea, The Washington Post reported.\n\nIt sounds extreme, but it\u2019s an authority so integral to Congress that it\u2019s in the name \u201cinherent contempt.\u201d Congress used that authority throughout much of its history to enforce its ability to subpoena people and documents, though it hasn\u2019t been used in nearly a century.\n\nUnder inherent contempt, Congress could fine people who aren\u2019t cooperating with them today. At the top of their list for any of these punishments might be the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who is withholding a whistleblower complaint about the president, or former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who complied with a subpoena but mocked Congress once there.\n\nSome House Democrats are talking about taking punishment into their own hands via inherent contempt because they\u2019re frustrated with Democratic leadership for not more fully embracing their impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut if past is any precedent, Congress could have a hard time starting to use it again.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a better understanding of what Congress can do to compel someone to talk and how inherent contempt fits into those efforts.\n\nThe most common tactic for compelling someone to speak to Congress is to subpoena them. It\u2019s a crime not to comply with a subpoena issued by a congressional body, punishable by \u201ca substantial fine and imprisonment for up to one year,\u201d according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nIf lawmakers find someone in contempt of Congress for not cooperating with a subpoena, it\u2019s the executive branch\u2019s duty to charge one of its own allies with a crime. Congress can also sue people (as they are with former White House counsel Donald McGahn, a key witness in the report by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III). But that can take months to come to a conclusion, and the threat of a lawsuit hasn\u2019t compelled any other Trump allies to testify.\n\nSo this Congress has to dig a little deeper to figure out what to do. For much of American history, the Congressional Research Service says, Congress just arrested people who wouldn\u2019t comply and held them themselves. That process is called inherent contempt because the theory goes that the ability to hold people in contempt of Congress is inherent in Congress\u2019s power, and Congress itself has the ability to enforce it.\n\nExcept that meting out punishment for refusing to cooperate is a logistical headache for Congress and is politically risky. I talked to historians about this in May, when Congress was on its way to holding Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt over a battle for information on the 2020 citizenship question. This was floated as a way to punish Barr for withholding information.\n\nAs I wrote then, every time Congress has arrested someone, it has had to improvise how to hold them, and the jailing itself has often backfired in terms of public sentiment and Congress\u2019s overall goal of getting information.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Congress jailed a journalist who proudly datelined his stories \u201cCustody of the Sergeant at Arms.\u201d They jailed a wealthy abolitionist who spent his time receiving sympathetic visitors and a real estate speculator who racked up the equivalent of $12,000 in food on Congress\u2019s dime. A Herbert Hoover official was held at the posh Willard Hotel.\n\nAlso important: Congress doesn\u2019t have a jail. It has held people in committee rooms before and could use the D.C. jails if it gets permission from the city. But for the most part, inherent contempt hasn\u2019t proved to be the punishment lawmakers wanted it to be.\n\nToday, inherent contempt is arguably more drastic than impeachment because of how rare and dramatic it would be. That\u2019s a problem for Democrats in Congress who are worried that impeachment would give Trump a boost in public sentiment.\n\nBut the fact that a centuries-old, somewhat crude enforcement tool is even being considered at the highest levels of Congress in 2019 underscores just how much the Trump administration\u2019s disregard for the democratic process has kneecapped Congress\u2019s ability to, well, do anything to oversee the executive branch. They\u2019re out of options except to create their own jail of sorts.", "description": "But they might want to be careful; history shows this can backfire in a number of ways.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kpAUcu7M8DyPZMH5OPHRgPRjAKo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K66QUVTPEEI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
