The pair met over the next two days and talks were \u00addescribed as \u201cvery positive\u201d, with Williams now pondering a lucrative offer to return to the code where he made his name.\u200b\n\nToronto are aiming to make a major impression following their elevation to British rugby league\u2019s top flight and Williams is No1 on their wish list.\u200b\n\nEarlier this month, McDermott confirmed initial talks had been held with the 34-year-old\u2019s representatives.\u200b\n\nHe said then: \u201cIf we had someone like him it would raise the profile of rugby league in Canada and \u00adToronto Wolfpack.\u200b\n\n\u201cThat would be great for us, but I would quickly add that he would have to be good as well.\u200b I don\u2019t just mean world-class headline-grabbing, but someone who is willing to make those tackles from marker, do the ugly stuff, have his nose bent and do the warrior-like performances week in and week out that some of these superstar players have in their game \u00adalready.
