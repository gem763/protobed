Do not encourage people to print out lists because the next list that comes out, your name will be on and then people will be coming after you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had something called a blacklist and a lot of really good people were accused of stuff,\u201d she continued. \u201cNobody cared whether it was true or not. They were accused. And they lost their right to work. You don't have the right! In this country, people can vote for who they want to. That is one of the great rights of this country.\u201d\n\nAs the uproar over both the Hollywood fundraiser and Messings\u2019 tweets raged, President Donald Trump himself jumped into the fray, claiming in a tweet that when both he and the actress worked at NBC, she came up to him at an event and \u201cprofusely thanked me, even calling me \u2018Sir,\u2019\u201d and adding, \u201cHow times have changed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don't have to like it, but we don't go after people because we don't like who they voted for,\u201d Goldberg added. \u201cWe don't go after them that way. We can talk about issues and stuff, but we don't print out lists.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Messing and her Will & Grace co-star Eric McCormack, who joined her in her call to print the list, Goldberg said, \u201cI'm sure you guys misspoke when you said that because it sounded like a good idea. Think about it. Read about it. Remember what the blacklist actually meant to people and don't encourage anyone\u2014anyone to do it.\u201d", "description": "\u201cListen, the last time people did this, people ended up killing themselves,\u201d Goldberg said, referring to Joseph McCarthy\u2019s Hollywood blacklist of the 1950s.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1403,w_2494,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567529459/WG_xm3jy7"}
