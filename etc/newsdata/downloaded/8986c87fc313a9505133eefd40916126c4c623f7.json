There was spontaneous applause from the floor for that small part of a much longer speech \u2013 it felt like a significant moment.\n\nThe New Zealand leader\u2019s trip to New York attracted the usual grumbles here at home \u2013 those who could not quite get their head around the very idea of a 38-year-old unmarried woman as prime minister carped about her decision to take her three-month-old daughter along \u2013 but the result was the blossoming of an international media love affair. Baby Neve\u2019s appearance at the back of the UN chamber was just the icing on the cake.\n\nAt the podium, speaking on the subject of gender equality, Ardern pleaded for #MeToo to become #WeToo. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d she said.\n\nArdern under pressure as staffer accused of sexual assault quits Read more\n\nSix months later the world watched her response to the 15 March mosque attacks in Christchurch and lauded her for it; another layer was added to her legend. Ardern\u2019s leadership has, all along, been about connection, equality, and justice by her own measurement. That entire fairytale now risks being brought down by a series of bungled attempts by her party apparatchiks to deal properly with examples of the very issue she so boldly addressed at the UN.\n\nIt\u2019s pertinent to remind ourselves that before Ardern took over the leadership of Labour just two months before the 2017 election, her party was polling a dismal 24%; an unwinnable position even with a couple of coalition partner opportunities. I remember a very experienced political reporter telling me more than a 10% bump would be unprecedented. After Ardern agreed to stand as leader, the party shot to 37%. Her ascent to the prime ministership prompted regular headlines using phrases like \u201cStardust victory\u201d and \u201cJacindamania.\u201d\n\nSince then domestic issues have rubbed away some of the gloss \u2013 for example, Labour\u2019s flagship response to a chronic housing crisis is widely regarded as a failure.\n\nBut these have been painted as blips by a still-popular government. The boldest of Labour\u2019s promises have always been its underlying strength and power \u2013 that this would be a caring and transparent government, the like of which had not been seen in several generations.\n\nIt\u2019s a very different Labour party we are seeing this week. The party wing has been exposed as anything but caring and transparent in the #MeToo space, and it\u2019s threatening to bring down not only a number of party officials, but the prime minister herself.\n\nThe backstory is only now coming out. As I wrote yesterday, young women were concerned about harassment in the party as far back as late 2017. One woman told the party\u2019s national council meeting about a \u201ctroubling culture of bullying, and of sexual harassment and assault\u201d. Nothing was done, and within months Labour was swept up in the first of a series of damaging sexual assault scandals.\n\nIts handling of this first series of assaults, at a Young Labour summer camp event, was heavily criticised but Labour appeared to learn nothing from the experience. Another investigation into \u201cpredatory\u201d and intimidating behaviour \u2013 by a different man \u2013 was launched in February, but not before a survivor group of at least 12 had made increasingly desperate attempts to get help from senior party figures over many months. They tell me one senior female party official even brushed off their concerns with this bit of classic gaslighting: \u201cOh, that\u2019s just [name withheld].\u201d\n\nThe investigation and its aftermath have descended into something close to farce; instead of appointing experts with experience in taking sensitive disclosures, Labour put three of its council members on the panel. The terms of reference appear to have been impossibly narrow and unfavourable for the complainants, an issue acknowledged by Ardern. Several of the group say they gave the panel detailed account of sexual assaults by the man, but the panel members say they \u201ccan\u2019t remember\u201d sexual misconduct being mentioned. The accused man brought his lawyer \u2013 the survivor group had only each other to lean on.\n\nIn June the panel reported back to Labour\u2019s council \u2013 no further action was to be taken. The witnesses and complainants never even had the chance to review their testimony. None of them were given a copy of the report. In July they sent their first email to media, naming the man and pleading for help. The email\u2019s second line reads:\n\nEach of us loyal Labour party members but we\u2019re scared of the political repercussions of what we\u2019re about to say.\n\nThat statement is what stands out today. Each of the young women I\u2019ve spoken to in the months since that email landed, still feels the pull of loyalty to Labour. They talk about it as a family, how they saw the people who ultimately let them down as \u201cmother and father\u201d figures. One told me yesterday, while she\u2019s relieved to see someone held accountable, the resignation of the party president Nigel Haworth for his part in this fiasco was \u201clike losing a member of the family\u201d.\n\nThey are also refusing to condemn Ardern. Her offer to meet with them has left some of these young women \u201cspeechless\u201d to think they\u2019ll be given an audience with the leader they view as inspirational.\n\nThe group now sees Ardern as the only person who can achieve the change they\u2019re demanding.\n\nBut if the past 18 months of full-time work researching and reporting #MeToo issues has taught me anything, it\u2019s that investigations into reports of sexual harassment are routinely bungled.\n\nThe fact that this happens everywhere does not excuse Labour. As many have pointed out, our country\u2019s leaders must be held to even higher standards than the rest of us.\n\nNow, we\u2019re all holding our breath to see what Ardern will do. She claims her officials did not tell her of the serious sexual nature of the complaints \u2013 fewer and fewer New Zealanders are ready to believe that this week \u2013 but whether true or not, this is her mess to clean up.\n\nHer credentials at home and abroad as a new kind of leader \u2013 kind, caring, compassionate and honest \u2013 all hang on her next move.", "description": "New Zealand prime minister\u2019s credentials at home and abroad as a new kind of leader all hang on her next move", "authors": ["Alison Mau"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f556bc9aa74e73670a630d7c62a228367cd2c0e4/494_12_2172_1303/master/2172.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=98033f296439820e2cc108fdd78098fa", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
