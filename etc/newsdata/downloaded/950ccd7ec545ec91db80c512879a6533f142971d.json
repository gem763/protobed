Rescuing the wounded? Tuk-tuk. Need to get from one place to another? Tuk-tuk!\u201d\n\nThe drivers, scrawny young men who use their horns liberally, have wrapped their cars in Iraqi flags, sparking cheers from protesters as they pass.\n\nIraqi celebrities have even been spotted snapping selfies with them, and the United Nations\u2019 top representative in the country, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, rode in one when she visited protesters in Tahrir on Wednesday.\n\nKorani praised them for their role in a movement calling for an end to official corruption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll erect a statue to tuk-tuk drivers here in Tahrir and give them all the big SUVs used by officials,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Everything has changed\u2019 \u2013\n\nAnother social barrier has been cracked as crowds of women have joined the rallies.\n\nIraqi society is largely conservative and in parts of the country, young men and women who are not married or related are rarely seen together in public.\n\nSamara, an engineering student in a black headscarf, is one of a growing number of students and schoolchildren skipping class to protest.\n\n\u201cBoys usually think us girls are weak and we can\u2019t go into these kinds of places, but the opposite is true,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe found all religions, all provinces, without divides. Everything has changed. We\u2019re one now,\u201d she told AFP, her pistachio-green eyes glimmering.\n\nThe majority of Iraqis are Shiite, with a large Sunni minority in the west and an autonomous Kurdish region in the north.\n\nThe country has been rocked by decades of back-to-back conflicts, including a particularly bloody period of sectarian violence around 2005 and the rise and fall of the Sunni extremist Islamic State group between 2014 and 2017.\n\nBut the young protesters in Tahrir say they\u2019re putting the country, where the youth make up 60 percent of the 40 million population, on a new path.\n\n\u201cWithout us, the country would have been destroyed,\u201d said Aminah Karim, a medical student with an Iraqi flag wrapped around her shoulders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a new society here that is healthier and includes everyone.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Food for the soul \u2013\n\nBut to revolt, one must eat. In Tahrir, protesters can take their pick from falafel and beans, bowls of hot lentil soup and burgers with fries, available around-the-clock and mostly for free.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making food for everyone!\u201d said Ibrahim Abdelhussein, doling out plates of rice and tender meat.\n\nHe even cooks masgoof, an iconic Iraqi delicacy of chargrilled, fatty carp eaten by hand.\n\nAt a makeshift medical clinic, volunteer Zainab al-Kaissi pointed out a huge pile of donated medicines.\n\n\u201cWhy am I here? Because I\u2019m Iraqi!\u201d said the 39-year-old proudly, sporting a white visor over her pink headscarf.\n\nThe field hospital was set up to treat those affected by tear gas fired by security forces.\n\nThe gas has left people struggling to breathe and some protestors have even died after being hit in the head or chest by the searing-hot canisters.\n\nSome pharmacists have offered discounts of nearly 40 percent to those buying painkillers, bandages and inhalers for demonstrators.\n\nProtesters have occupied Tahrir for seven consecutive days, ignoring an overnight curfew declared by the army and volunteering to keep the streets clean.\n\nAlia, a 29-year-old student, snapped on her red plastic gloves and picked up a bucket, broom and dustbin to tackle piles of rubbish left in the streets.\n\nShe was joined by her new comrades, girls she had met just days ago in the carnival-like atmosphere.\n\nNearby, girls with tangles of uncovered curly hair marched next to older Shiite clerics in white turbans.\n\nTents erected by residents of the Shiite stronghold of Sadr City bordered small stands where Iraqis with gravity-defying coiffes broadcast electro beats.\n\n\u201cWe came here and were surprised to see so many people from Sadr City. We didn\u2019t think they\u2019d join us,\u201d one student told AFP, raising his thick eyebrows.\n\nA little further on, volunteers bandaged protesters wounded when security forces fired tear gas canisters to disperse their rally.\n\nBut as the smell dispersed, another one took its place \u2014 that of hot, fresh falafel.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 It has become the focal point of protests and a social melting pot: Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square, the site of a week of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/eb12cc_tuk-tuk-drivers-unofficial-heroes-iraq-demonstrations-protestors-bond-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
