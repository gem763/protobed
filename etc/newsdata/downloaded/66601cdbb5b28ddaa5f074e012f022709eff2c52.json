I didn\u2019t start watching until I was approached about this job.\n\n\u2018But my brother [photographer Ben Watts], who is heavily into it, told me \u201cUnder no circumstances are you going to turn this down\u201d.\u2019\n\nThe official synopsis for Bloodmoon read: \u2018Taking place thousands of years before the events of Game Of Thrones, the series chronicles the world\u2019s descent from the golden Age Of Heroes into its darkest hour.\n\n\u2018And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westero\u2019s history to the true origin of the White Walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend\u2026 it\u2019s not the story we think we know.\u2019\n\nAlthough Bloodmoon is no more, it was confirmed last month that another spin-off has been given the green-light and will be based on Martin\u2019s book Fire * Blood.\n\nAccording to Deadline, the author and Colony co-creator Ryan Condal have written the series for HBO, which is set 300 years before the events of the original series and charts the beginning of the end for House Targaryen.\n\nBloodmoon\u2019s binning comes just one day after it was announced that Game Of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss had dropped out of the Star Wars trilogy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted HBO for comment.\n\nGame Of Thrones is available to stream on Sky, HBO and NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
