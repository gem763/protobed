I cannot have her in my home any longer.\u201d The doll, which has been photographed atop a Ouija board, can be purchased for $99.99 plus $7.70 shipping. The Ouija board is not included.\n\n\u201cI just got obsessed,\u201d said the artist Eric Oglander, 31, speaking of the night two years ago when he first came across a listing like this one. The item was described as a \u201chaunted box,\u201d and he immediately began searching for others. That night he captured screenshots of more than fifty similar listings, and has been looking for them ever since.\n\nOglander describes himself as a \u201ccollector of aesthetics,\u201d and his material is the ephemera of the world around us. For him, it is not the item on sale, but rather the listing itself which becomes the object. The listings are \u201ca way of containing a story and also telling a story,\u201d he said. The images here are taken from this collection.\n\nHis previous work includes \u201cCraigslist Mirrors,\u201d a popular Tumblr site that was published as a book in 2016. Seemingly simple in conceit, it consists exclusively of screenshots of listings of people selling mirrors on Craigslist. The images are funny, poignant and often unintentionally telling, revealing strange corners of peoples\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the fact that these photos are being taken for the sole intent of selling an object,\u201d Oglander said. Once they are put into a new context, however, \u201cthey can then be appreciated as something aesthetic.\u201d By collecting the listings in this way, Oglander brings out patterns that may go otherwise unnoticed, and if so, only in passing.\n\nThe \u201chaunted\u201d eBay listings include many ordinary objects: feathers, coins, pebbles, pieces of wood. Often they are said to be enchanted, for luck or for fortune \u2014 good or ill. \u201cYou will be able to feel the vibrational energy from your coin. Must be a positive environment and attitude for it to work,\u201d advises one seller. \u201cPlease note, this chip is for MONEY LUCK only, not general good fortune or finding love which are different spells,\u201d warns another.\n\nOther items are said to have powers all their own. \u201cHearing voices is really common. Sounds, faces appearing,\u201d Oglander said. \u201cBut also, misfortunes happening, a string of negative events happening in peoples\u2019 lives \u2014 like these objects have cursed them.\u201d\n\nThe claims are, of course, difficult to verify. The site\u2019s rules dictate that all listings must \u201coffer a physical item or a tangible service.\u201d Many listings include disclaimers about the objects\u2019 supernatural attributes. \u201cAs required per eBay\u2019s policy on the sale of paranormal items, this is for the sale of a tangible item only, no promise of a spirit attached,\u201d writes one seller. \u201cPurchase with caution,\u201d writes another. \u201cNot recommended for Children to play with.\u201d\n\nStill, such disclaimers do not entirely prevent instances of negative feedback from disappointed customers, which sellers sometimes address. \u201cThey often reply and say that you need to exist with it for a while before you start experiencing things,\u201d said Oglander. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give it enough time.\u201d\n\nIn this context, \u201cBUYER BEWARE\u201d serves as both a disclaimer and as a potential selling point. As one listing put it, \u201cI do not take any responsibility for, if anything at all happens, blown fuses, divorce etc!\u201d The item, a vintage teddy bear, sold for $560 after 46 bids.\n\nWhen asked if he was superstitious, Oglander said, \u201cI guess I believe in spirits. I want to at least hope that there\u2019s some magic in the world \u2014 some underlying thing we can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nStill, he has never bought a \u201chaunted\u201d item.", "description": "An artist\u2019s obsession with listings for the cursed, doomed and otherwise unexplained.", "authors": ["Alicia Desantis"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/arts/25haunted-ebay-promo/25haunted-ebay-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
