They see a 14% rise in the current year, helped by strength in China and new markets.\n\nSome have been marking down forecasts since Uniqlo and other Japanese businesses were targeted by South Korean boycotts amid a diplomatic spat - a reminder of risks that come with overseas expansion. The company opened its first store in India last week and is also expanding in markets such as Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nSales in South Korea, which account for around 8% of sales in Fast Retailing\u2019s flagship Uniqlo business, fell 40% year-on-year in July and more in August, the Nikkei reported.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Dairo Murata recently lowered his Fast Retailing earnings forecast for the current year by 4.6% and cut his price target on the shares to 68,000 yen from 70,000 yen.\n\nThe shares last traded at around 61,300 yen, up 15% in the year to date.\n\n\u201cWe foresee a double-digit decline in sales and a roughly 40% fall in operating profit for the South Korea business,\u201d Murata said in a client note, adding that the yen\u2019s appreciation against China\u2019s yuan was another near-term negative factor.\n\nFast Retailing\u2019s biggest growth market in recent years has been China, where it opened its first Uniqlo store in 2002 and now has over 700 locations. The company has said it expects Greater China revenue to grow to 1 trillion yen in fiscal 2022.\n\nThe Japan market, by contrast, has shown little growth. Uniqlo\u2019s September same-store sales data showed a 4.2% decline from a year earlier, with analysts saying they had expected stronger sales ahead of a consumption tax hike this month.\n\nSUCCESSION\n\nAnother key focus on Thursday will be succession planning. Previously, Yanai said he would retire at 65 but shelved such plans when the time approached.\n\nHe has said he does not want his two sons to take the top job, though both were promoted to the ranks of company directors last year.\n\nThe next leader will be tasked not only with maintaining growth in China but also addressing long-term problems, such as its struggle to establish its brand in the United States. Investors are also keen for more results from recent technology investments including automated checkout and state-of-the-art logistics systems.\n\nPossible successors include finance chief Takeshi Okazaki, who joined Fast Retailing from McKinsey & Co in 2011, and Pan Ning, head of Uniqlo\u2019s China operations.\n\nMaki Akaida, head of Uniqlo\u2019s Japan operations, is also considered a candidate after Bloomberg News reported Yanai as preferring a female leader.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "A South Korean boycott of Japanese goods is seen dragging down sales at Fast Retailing Co Ltd\u2019s Uniqlo stores, denting otherwise strong financial results due to be announced on Thursday by Asia\u2019s biggest fashion group, analysts said.
