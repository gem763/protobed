Mr. Bolton has advised that the president can make good on his promise to draw down troops in Afghanistan without agreeing to one. That option, Mr. Bolton has said, gives the president flexibility to revisit talks in the future.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should President Trump meet with Afghanistan\u2019s president and Taliban leaders? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Trump suspended talks between the U.S. and the Taliban in Qatar and said a previously undisclosed peace summit at Camp David was canceled, a move welcomed by Afghan officials.\n\nMr. Trump cited a car-bomb attack in the east of the Afghan capital Thursday that killed 12 people, including a Romanian and a U.S. soldier, and wounded dozens, for which the Taliban claimed responsibility. This year, 15 other U.S. service members have been killed in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d Mr. Trump, a Republican, wrote on Twitter Saturday night. \u201cHow many more decades are they willing to fight?\u201d\n\nThe Afghan government, which had not been a party to the Qatar talks, praised Mr. Trump\u2019s decision on Sunday. But a Taliban official, speaking on behalf of the group in Doha, the capital of Qatar, said Taliban leaders had not in fact agreed to a meeting until the deal was completed, accusing the president of lying about the purported Camp David plans. Any deal would have been announced in Doha first, the official said.\n\n\u201cWe accepted the invitation but said we would come soon after the signing ceremony of the agreement,\u201d the Taliban official told The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo declined on Sunday to say whether the planned meeting had actually been confirmed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some confusion,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said on CBS. \u201cSuffice it to say, we were confident that we were going to be able to have these meetings, what would be this afternoon, at Camp David.\u201d\n\nHe also said there remained outstanding disagreements with the Taliban.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t complete, still lots of implementation issues, lots of technical issues that needed to be worked on even though we\u2019ve been doing this for months,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said on Fox News Sunday.\n\nHe didn\u2019t elaborate, but officials who follow the process closely have said these include the extent of U.S. military support for Afghan forces and how to implement the deal, a key component of which is talks among Afghans and reducing violence in places where the U.S. has withdrawn its troops.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments about the planned meeting with the Taliban drew strong reactions Sunday from lawmakers.\n\n\u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) wrote on Twitter. She added, \u201cNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever. The Taliban still harbors al Qaeda. The President is right to end the talks.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), who is running for president, agreed the U.S. should be holding talks with the Kabul government and the Taliban, but told NBC that Mr. Trump \u201cclearly wanted this showman\u2019s moment of having them come to Camp David, when he didn\u2019t even have a complete cease-fire.\u201d\n\nZalmay Khalilzad, the top U.S. negotiator in the peace process, said a week ago that the U.S. and the Taliban were on the \u201cthreshold of an agreement\u201d and that a completed deal awaited Mr. Trump\u2019s signoff.\n\nSediq Seddiqi, spokesman for Afghanistan\u2019s president, praised President Trump\u2019s decision to cancel a secret meeting with Afghan and Taliban leaders and suspend U.S. negotiations with the insurgents.

Mr. Pompeo declined to say on Sunday whether Mr. Trump would nevertheless go ahead with the long-planned withdrawal.\n\nMost of the remaining 9,500 U.S. forces, along with about 8,600 additional foreign forces, mainly from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, would be withdrawn in phases, provided the Taliban follows through on its assurances not to allow Islamic State, al Qaeda and other radical jihadist groups to operate in Afghanistan. The Taliban also would agree to enter talks with other Afghans in Oslo.\n\nAfter Mr. Khalilzad briefed the Afghan government last week about the proposed accord, the Kabul administration said it was concerned the deal had no penalties should the Taliban not honor promises under the deal.\n\nSince taking office, Mr. Trump has been torn between his longtime opposition to the war and resistance from within his cabinet and Congress to pull troops out.\n\nThe president had continued to equivocate over a deal. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said Aug. 29 on Fox News Radio. \u201cIt\u2019s getting close, but if it happens\u2014who knows if it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nAfter reluctantly agreeing to a plan to increase troops and escalate operations against the Taliban, Mr. Trump replaced national security adviser H.R. McMaster, the main proponent of the so-called South Asian strategy to force the Taliban to the table. Mr. Trump later chose Mr. Khalilzad to get a deal with the Taliban instead.\n\nMr. Khalilzad has been under intense pressure to reach a deal by Sept. 1. Former officials who follow Afghanistan closely said Mr. Trump has been trapped in the same corner as his predecessor, President Obama, in the face of warnings from the national security establishment that pulling out could expose the U.S. to another major terrorist attack.\n\nMr. Trump was personally dismayed by the death last week of a U.S. soldier in the bomb attack in Kabul, and the Taliban\u2019s claim of responsibility weighed on him heavily, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nThursday\u2019s suicide bombing in the Afghan capital was the latest in a series of Taliban attacks as the negotiations entered their late stages. Since the U.S. and the Taliban resumed direct talks in Doha more than a year ago, both sides have escalated military operations to gain leverage at the negotiating table.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Pompeo said the U.S. has killed over 1,000 insurgents in the past 10 days. In July, the United Nations said U.S. and Afghan security forces had been responsible for more civilian deaths this year than the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, long-simmering skepticism about the deal has stepped up in Washington since Mr. Khalilzad comments last week.\n\nIn a joint letter last Tuesday, six former U.S. ambassadors to Afghanistan condemned the U.S. approach to negotiating a troop withdrawal, warning it risked a return to \u201ctotal civil war.\u201d\n\nThe secrecy around the deal and the prospect of a full U.S. withdrawal has drawn criticism on Capitol Hill.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) has said he would introduce legislation that would require the secretaries of defense and state to certify that a withdrawal wouldn\u2019t expose the U.S. to a terrorist attack at home.\n\nOn Thursday, Rep. Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called on Mr. Khalilzad to testify before the committee and give the American people \u201ca long-overdue opportunity to understand the contours of your negotiations with the Taliban and the potential risks and opportunities that may result.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision, announced in a series of tweets Saturday evening, allayed, at least for the moment, mounting fears of Afghan officials, politicians and many in the public that an imminent deal between Washington and the Taliban was catapulting the country toward catastrophe. The decision also paves the way for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to hold a twice-postponed presidential election this month, which could extend his time in power.\n\nThe insurgents have refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul administration, which they view as illegitimate.\n\nAfghan officials lambasted the draft deal during four days of briefings with Mr. Khalilzad in Kabul this week, branding it \u201cmeaningless\u201d and insisting the agreement\u2019s guarantees of Taliban compliance weren\u2019t strong enough.\n\nSediq Seddiqi, spokesman for Mr. Ghani, said Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement demonstrated his understanding that the draft accord \u201cwould not lead to a cease-fire and direct talks between the Taliban and Afghan government.\u201d The U.S. president\u2019s decision, Mr. Seddiqi said, \u201creflects the concerns raised by the Afghan people and government about a process that would make a group that is behind the killings of so many innocent people, both Afghans and otherwise, look victorious, rather than lead them to halt violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Taliban\u2019s honeymoon in Doha should be ended,\u201d he said later.\n\nWrite to Jessica Donati at jessica.donati@wsj.com, Michael C.
