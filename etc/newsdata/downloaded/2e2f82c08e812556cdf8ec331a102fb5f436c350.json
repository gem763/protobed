Major water restrictions were applied as the province inched closer to Day Zero.\n\nThis affected tourism and agriculture, upturned people\u2019s lives and had a huge economic impact.\n\nIn Gauteng, the Vaal Dam has dipped below 50%.\n\nThis massive water system supplies the agriculture and mining sectors, as well as homes, schools and hospitals, with potable water.\n\nIt is fed by the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. In fact, an estimated 25% of the dam\u2019s water is from Lesotho, which is itself in the grip of a drought.\n\nGovernment is aware of the looming crisis and has ample and applicable plans to ameliorate the problem.\n\nBut these are plans on paper, and little has been actioned.\n\nBillions have been squandered on projects that have yielded little, and there is precious little money left to take up the fight.\n\nGovernment must act now. We need desalination plants, dams to stop the water before it hits the sea and sensible water regimes to enforce on citizens.\n\nAs citizens, we are as much to blame for excess use.\n\nWe love our swimming pools, washing our cars, watering our gardens, and taking long showers and full baths. We pay little heed to the future if everything is good now.\n\nWe need to heed the urgent call to save water. In doing so, we just might save our future.", "description": "Water and its ever-increasing scarcity will be the catalyst for the world\u2019s next wars, unless we learn to manage this resource effectively and prudently.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7776/c67ed9b376b54efdac25c34238ca8505.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
