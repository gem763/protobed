It Helps, Too.", "language": "en", "text": "Pete Buttigieg vaulted in to the top four of a crowded Democratic presidential field because he has an agile intellect, is fiercely articulate and both espouses and embodies a fresh perspective that many voters of all stripes crave.\n\nHe also got there because he\u2019s gay.\n\nHe\u2019d be the first to acknowledge that. In fact he did acknowledge it when we spoke last June about the state of L.G.B.T.Q. rights in America. Referring to his sexual orientation and his marriage to another man, he told me, \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that it led to there being more interest and attention early on.\u201d He stood out among the dozens of Democratic aspirants, each desperate to do precisely that.\n\nBut there\u2019s a big difference between winning over enough Americans to land in his current position \u2014 he placed second, behind Elizabeth Warren, in one survey of Iowa voters last week \u2014 and having an appeal broad enough to nab the party\u2019s nomination, let alone the White House. Is being gay an insurmountable obstacle on the path to those prizes?\n\nAnyone who answers with an unequivocal yes or no is just guessing.\n\nThe question is now being asked more urgently than before, as the primary contests draw closer and many Democrats simultaneously assess the risks of the two front-runners, Warren and Joe Biden, and survey the field anew, wondering if anyone in the tier of candidates just below them might be a better opponent for Donald Trump. Their gazes invariably fall on Buttigieg, but their apprehensions include whether America could really elect a gay president.", "description": "America\u2019s need for a savior outweighs any interest in what he or she does in bed.", "authors": ["Frank Bruni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/opinion/29Bruni-4/merlin_153532737_8b678388-5511-4d98-ac60-e3cac31a96a5-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
