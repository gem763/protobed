In addition to daily hemp milk protein shakes and a regular \u201cgarbage disposal salad,\u201d Bell takes in the occasional therapy session, a daily SSRI antidepressant and a dose of CBD oil, the latter of which allows her to stop analyzing her to-do list, reports the mag.\n\nBell, 39, also dips into a \u201ctoolbox\u201d she created with Dax Shepard, her husband since 2013, giving him a heads up when she\u2019s sad, so he won\u2019t personalize her mood. And she takes advice from his AA meetings. \u201cYou just have to do the next right thing. You just stand up. That\u2019s the next right thing. Then you brush your teeth. That\u2019s the next right thing. It\u2019s very one-step-at-a-time,\u201d Bell told Women\u2019s Health. (Shepard has been sober for 14 years, he told People in March).\n\nBell has spoken a lot about mental health, crediting her courage to Shepard, who reportedly urged her to open up. Addressing whether she was nervous to reveal those intimate details to the world, Bell told Women\u2019s Health, \u201cYes, for the first 10 minutes. I realized that this is the shame that prevents people from talking about it. I immediately felt irresponsible, because I do care about depression not being taboo, yet I present this bubbly, outgoing girl who seemingly gets through life with a smile on her face, and I\u2019d never discussed that some days, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKristen Bell is sharing how she maintains her mental health in the latest issue of Women's Health. (Photo: Dennis Leupold for Women\u2019s Health) More\n\nDuring a 2016 interview with Off Camera with Sam Jones, Bell revealed little-known details about herself. \u201cI\u2019m extremely co-dependent. I shatter a little bit when I think people don\u2019t like me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's part of why I lead with kindness and I compensate by being very bubbly all the time because it really hurts my feelings when I know I'm not liked. And I know that's not very healthy and I fight it all the time.\"\n\nBell later said in that interview, \"I also struggled a lot with anxiety and depression ... My mom sat me down when I was probably 18 and she said, 'There is a serotonin imbalance in our family line and it can often be passed from female to female ...'\"\n\nAs for the medication Bell has taken since a young age, she told Jones,\"I have no shame in that because my mom had said to me, 'If you start to feel this way, talk to your doctor, talk to a psychologist, see how you want to help yourself, and if you do decide to go on a prescription to help yourself, understand that the world wants to shame you for that, but in the medical community, you would never deny a diabetic his insulin, ever.' But for some reason, when someone needs a serotonin inhibitor, they're immediately crazy or something.\"\n\nTo seal her point, Bell wrote a 2016 essay for Time titled \u201cI'm Over Staying Silent About Depression,\u201d in which she clarified some misconceptions.", "description": "Kristen Bell told \"Women's Health\" about how she battles depression and anxiety.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/giMbsBfGdVfxN1z6k4M2AA--~B/aD0xNjMxO3c9MTIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/9fda4070-eabd-11e9-b6cb-dd01611a4df1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
