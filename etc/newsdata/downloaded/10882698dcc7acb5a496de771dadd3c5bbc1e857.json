REUTERS/Edgar Su/Files\n\nSpot gold was little changed at $1,498.80 per ounce, as of 0535 GMT, after rising as much as 1% in the previous session on intensifying tensions in the Middle East.\n\nU.S. gold futures were down 0.4% at $1,505.6 per ounce.\n\n\u201cThe market is searching for a new catalyst ... The 25 basis point rate cut is relatively priced in already, but what traders are really looking for is forward guidance,\u201d Phillip Futures analyst Benjamin Lu said.\n\nA quarter-point rate cut is widely expected when the Fed issues its next policy statement on Wednesday, which would be the central bank\u2019s second such cut after lowering rates in July for the first time since 2008.\n\nA press conference by Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to follow the release of the central bank\u2019s statement.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s language and new economic projections will be watched out for amid a bruising U.S.-China trade war, stimulus by the European Central Bank, and a stream of weak manufacturing data that may hint at larger problems for the United States.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed goes against market expectations, there is a strong possibility that we may see a short-term reversal (in gold prices) and a quick sharp test towards $1,455,\u201d Lu said.\n\nAlso, the weekend bombings of Saudi Arabia\u2019s main oil refinery have sparked U.S. President Donald Trump to pressure the Fed anew to lower rates.\n\n\u201cIt appears conviction remains positive so long as gold hangs around $1,500,\u201d Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader, said in a note.\n\n\u201cFlows have been very mixed caught between pre-FOMC position squaring while hedging for a possible U.S. military response on Iran.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, currencies of oil-exporting countries held firm, while the U.S. dollar found broad support as the attacks on Saudi oil facilities and the threat of military action in the region buoyed crude prices, while stocks were under pressure.\n\nTrump said on Monday it looked like Iran was behind the attacks but stressed he did not want to go to war.\n\nOn the technical front, spot gold looked neutral in a range of $1,488-$1,523.61 per ounce, and an escape could suggest a direction, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\n\nElsewhere, silver was steady at $17.85 an ounce.\n\nPlatinum edged up 0.1% to $937.64, while palladium was steady at $1,605.07, having touched a record high of $1,626.81 in the previous session.", "description": "Gold traded steady on Tuesday as most traders stayed on the sidelines ahead of a widely expected rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this week.", "authors": ["Eileen Soreng", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430703615&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G092", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
