Wednesday: 12 hours for amendments from 1pm culminating in a 1am vote on a second referendum.\n\n12 hours for amendments from 1pm culminating in a 1am vote on a second referendum. Thursday: 8 hours for the final stages and final vote finishing at around 7.30pm.\n\nThe PM is doing this in a frantic bid to get Royal Assent before 11pm on October 31, so he can cancel a request to delay Brexit and leave on time. But MPs are furious at being forced to approve such a far-reaching Bill without reading it properly.\n\nWhat does it include?\n\nThe Bill is designed to ensure there aren't legal gaps in the UK when EU law automatically ends at 11pm on October 31 (or whenever Brexit actually happens).\n\nIt also encodes the 585-page Withdrawal Agreement, plus Boris Johnson's 64 pages of amendments, into law.\n\nThis includes the arrangements for Northern Ireland in Boris Johnson's new deal - which force customs checks on goods travelling from Britain to Belfast.\n\nIt includes guarantees on the rights of EU citizens to stay, with a new 'independent monitoring authority' to ensure their rights are upheld.\n\nAnd it includes the \u00a339bn divorce bill and the transition period, which will extend all EU laws until 31 December 2020 while the UK and EU negotiate a permanent trade deal.\n\nThe Bill doesn't say what will happen in the future trade deal - that's a matter for the future. But it does force ministers to make a statement on objectives for it within 30 Commons sitting days of Brexit.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bill ditches the need for a separate meaningful vote on the deal - which Boris Johnson last tried to hold on Monday. Once the Bill becomes an Act, that's it - Brexit has been approved.\n\nWhat are the main problems?\n\nMPs and experts have been quick to point out a raft of problems with the Bill that they fear just can't be sorted within three days. Here are a few of them.\n\n1. It's being rushed through Parliament\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nBoris Johnson is trying to give the Bill less time and scrutiny than one which banned 19 individual wild animals in circuses.\n\nHe wants to rush it through the House of Commons in just three days, including line-by-line amendments of the 110-page document and 124 pages of explanatory notes.\n\nBy contrast, the Lisbon treaty was debated for 11 days, Maastricht for 23 and the Treaty of Rome for 22.\n\nMPs were mounting a bid to vote down the timetable - which includes sitting well beyond midnight - when it came up for a decision at about 7.30pm on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed \"people who do not vote for the programme motion will not be voting for Brexit on October 31.\"\n\nBut Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer accused the Prime Minister, who's already had to ask for a three-month delay anyway, of trying to \"bounce\" MPs into supporting a plan that was \"deeply flawed\".\n\n\"It is outrageous to deny Parliament the chance to scrutinise this incredibly important legislation properly,\" he said.\n\n\"Ministers are trying to bounce MPs into signing off a Bill that could cause huge damage to our country. We can't trust this Prime Minister.\"\n\n2. It faces being amended beyond recognition\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe first hurdle vote on Tuesday night was expected to pass, but the devil's in the detail.\n\nMPs will try to pass a huge list of amendments to the deal. Crucially Labour wants a customs union - which would tear up the current arrangements for Northern Ireland.\n\nLabour was also expected to back a bid for a second referendum when it is brought forward by MPs.\n\nThe problem with all this is if the deal between the UK and EU is effectively changed, Boris Johnson could have to go back to Brussels and ask for tweaks or leniency to get it through.\n\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick refused to rule out pulling the Bill altogether if it's amended - a move that'd mean it can't come back before a new session or election.\n\nHe said: \"That will be a decision for the Prime Minister, but we\u2019re not going to compromise on this deal.\"\n\n3. There's a 'trapdoor to no-deal Brexit'\n\n(Image: Kiran Ridley)\n\nMPs are furious at Clause 30 of the Bill - which they say creates a \"trapdoor\" to no-deal Brexit in just 14 months.\n\nClause 30 says what happens if an EU-UK 'Joint Committee' agree to extend the transition period beyond December 2020.\n\nIf both sides want to extend, the Prime Minister will have to get the extension including its length approved in a vote in Parliament.\n\nBut what it doesn't say is anything about letting Parliament demand an extension, if Boris Johnson refuses to ask for one - yet there's still no trade deal and a no-deal cliff-edge is looming on the horizon.\n\nHilary Benn, chairman of the Commons Brexit Committee, said: \"What happens if the Government doesn\u2019t propose an extension?\n\n\"Parliament would have no say and we would exit the transition period on the 31 Dec 2020 even if a trade agreement hadn\u2019t been reached by then with the EU; ie no deal.\"\n\n4. There's no proper impact assessment\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nTory ministers have refused to publish a proper impact assessment of how the Brexit deal will hit the economy.\n\nThe only assessment they've put out claims the Bill will cost the economy \u00a3167m a year in \"direct\" costs.\n\nThat's a laughably small figure in government terms that doesn't count either the \u00a339bn divorce bill, or the end of billions in payments to Brussels.\n\nBy comparison we've already spent \u00a38bn on no-deal plans.\n\nChancellor Sajid Javid refused to bow to calls for a proper impact assessment.\n\nIn an astonishing statement from the UK's finance minister, he said: \"Trust in democracy and bringing an end to the division that has characterised this debate over the past three years, is something that cannot be measured solely through spreadsheets or impact assessments.\"\n\n5. It creates customs checks in the Irish Sea\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBoris Johnson's DUP allies are furious at the deal for creating a customs border down the Irish Sea - something it was claimed no UK PM could ever do.\n\nWhile legally Northern Ireland is in the UK customs union, EU customs rules apply to goods entering Northern Ireland that are deemed \"at risk\" of moving into the EU at a later date.\n\nAnd since there can't be checks on the 310-mile Irish border, checks would instead happen when goods enter Northern Ireland across the Irish Sea.\n\nThat means British firms selling into Northern Ireland will be hit with a barrage of red tape and higher costs.\n\nThe government's own analysis of the Bill confirms British firms will have to fill out at least two customs forms for goods traded west across the Irish Sea.\n\nThis will lead to \"additional administrative costs\" on goods moving from east to west - estimated at around \u00a315 to \u00a356 per customs declaration.\n\nSeparately firms will also face fees of at least 55 Euros (\u00a347) at border inspection posts when sending \"products of animal origin\" from Britain to Northern Ireland.\n\nIt comes despite Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith boasting he was aiming for \"unfettered access\" between Belfast and Britain.\n\n6. Workers' rights guarantees are laughably weak\n\n(Image: Leon Neal)\n\nBoris Johnson was already under fire for moving workers' rights guarantees out of the deal and into the non-legally-binding 'Political Declaration'.\n\nNow he facing losing precious support from Labour backbenchers after his promises for workers' rights were revealed as laughably poor.\n\nThe Bill declares that each time ministers make a new law in future, they'd have to commit that \"in their view\" it doesn't \"regress\" from EU workers' rights.\n\nErr - or if they can't do that, they can just make a statement saying it might regress from EU workers' rights but they want to go ahead with the new law anyway!\n\nGreen MP Caroline Lucas branded it a \"race to the bottom\" while Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"This is the so-called protection for workers' rights - government must make a statement on whether or not a future Bill erodes workers' rights.\n\n\"But even if it does, they can still proceed. No wonder (the Trades Union Congress) is advising Labour MPs not to fall for it.\"\n\nLabour MP Liz Kendall said: \"This does not provide the guarantees to protect workers rights that MPs have been promised.\"\n\nJeremy Corbyn said: \"Labour opposes Johnson\u2019s sell-out deal and will seize every opportunity to safeguard workers\u2019 rights, protect our economy and ensure the people are given the final say.\"\n\n7. MPs have to find money for the divorce bill\n\nUntil 31 March 2021, money for the \u00a339bn 'divorce bill' will be found from the Treasury's 'Consolidated Fund' or 'National Loans Fund'.\n\nBut the divorce bill isn't a lump sum and it doesn't end when we leave. It consists of payments spread out over many years.\n\nInterestingly the deal makes clear that after March 2021, MPs in Parliament would have to vote on and allocate money for paying to the EU.\n\nThis would create a new public row about spending priorities from a deal which had already been agreed.\n\n8. The government is given sweeping powers\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\nIf you have a long memory you might remember a row over 'Henry VIII' powers in Theresa May's original Brexit deal.\n\nWell, the row is back. And this time it relates to that definitely-not-controversial-at-all area of Northern Ireland.\n\nClause 21 declares a government minister can make regulations they \"consider appropriate\" to deal with \"matters arising out of or related to\" the part of the deal that relates to Northern Ireland.\n\nThese extend to anything that could be made by an Act of Parliament - including modifying the WAB itself.\n\nThis is likely to be blasted as a huge power grab that could undemocratically change arrangements for Northern Ireland without proper scrutiny.\n\n9. We'll still follow new EU laws until 2021 - at least\n\n(Image: Leon Neal)\n\nClause 1 opens with a zinger for the hard Brexiteer Tories.\n\nNot only will we continue to follow EU laws in the transition period - we'll also follow new EU laws that are made while we are in transition.\n\nThat is set to last to December 2020 but could be extended.\n\nMeanwhile, the 1972 European Communities Act - which Theresa May trumped she was abolishing - will be brought back in a \"repurposed\" form throughout the transition.\n\nThere would be \"extra scrutiny\" of EU laws, the government claims.\n\nParliament's European Scrutiny Committee is given powers to make motions, which MPs would vote on, about new EU laws.\n\nExcept it's not clear what these motions would actually say and doesn't appear they could block new EU laws.", "description": "Boris Johnson is trying to rush through one of the most complex laws in years - in just three days.
