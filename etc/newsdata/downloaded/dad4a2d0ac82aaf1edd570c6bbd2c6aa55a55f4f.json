He added that he plans to introduce a resolution to address the goals as well.\n\n\u201cMany of the jurisdictions in this area will far exceed the expectations,\u201d Mr. Davis said.\n\nThis summer, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a private-public partnership to raise $35 million to create 36,000 affordable housing units in the District by 2025.\n\nOne of the challenges to achieving the goals of growth is resistance from residents, and Rockville Mayor Bridget Donnell Newton raised questions about the region\u2019s approach to address that.\n\n\u201cThis climate of fear is out there,\u201d Ms. Newton said. \u201cWhen people hear [about] more housing, they are immediately panicked about the roads and the schools.\u201d\n\nD.C. Council member and COG Chairman Robert White Jr. said that making sure residents understand that the \u201ccost of inaction is continued displacement and economic slowdown in our region\u201d\n\n\u201cI do believe we can get residents on board but only if they are a part of the conversation,\u201d Mr. White said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
