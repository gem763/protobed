Earning $33 million and surpassing earning expectations, it was the best opening weekend yet for lead actress Jennifer Lopez, who stars alongside Constance Wu as the masterminds of the illicit business scheme.\n\nBreena Kerr\n\nBut many real life strippers have spoken out against the movie on social media, saying they're upset by a disconnect: a film about fictional strippers is celebrated while strippers are often dismissed and ostracized in real life. Some also say they fear that their work -- already stigmatized -- will now be conflated with criminal activity.\n\nI saw \"Hustlers\" over the weekend and loved it. It has the same timeless appeal of Robin Hood, except here, Robin Hood works in a strip club, stealing from Wall Street sharks and giving to, well, herself. Or, as Lopez's character, Ramona, frames her ethical starting point to Destiny, played by Wu, \"The game is rigged, it does not reward people who play by the rules.\" Ramona proceeds accordingly. But after talking to a number of women who do the real-life work that's glamorized in the film, I have more complex feelings about \"Hustlers.\"\n\nStrippers I talked to, as well as many who spoke out on social media, emphasized their objections to the film's portrayal of women like them as criminals, pointing out that those who do this work are doing work, period -- they're putting on a show because it's their job.\n\nLili Reinhart, Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer, and Constance Wu in 'Hustlers'\n\nJacqueline Frances, a stripper, artist, and comedian who acted as a consultant for \"Hustlers,\" later told me on the phone, \"Hustlers\" isn't so much about getting away with a crime, or the world of strip clubs generally. It's a story about women \"surviving under capitalism.\" Based on the reviews and box office numbers, people love it. Why then, real strippers seem to be wondering, don't they get more support for the work they choose to do in our capitalist world?\n\nRead More", "description": "Breena Kerr, like millions of others, recently saw \"Hustlers\" and loved it.
