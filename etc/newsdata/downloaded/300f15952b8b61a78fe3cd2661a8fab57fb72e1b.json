But unfortunately, the four-legged-friend was dazed and didn't move. That's when the 38-year-old thespian sprang into action and left the side of the woman he was with and stepped into the heavy traffic to stop everything and rescue the dog.\n\nThe Donnie Darko star then led the dog back to its owner safe and unharmed. The witness said, \"He really was a hero.\"\n\nJake had several dogs, including puggle Boo Radley and German shepherd Atticus.\n\nCompiled by Alex Isaacs.
