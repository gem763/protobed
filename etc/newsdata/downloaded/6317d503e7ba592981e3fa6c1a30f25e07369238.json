Just not today.\n\nSlight update: After the Labor Department reinstated Leif Olson, Bloomberg Law published a new story noting Olson had rejoined the agency. I\u2019m told, however, reporters at Bloomberg Law were instructed not to tweet the new story out. It has also not been promoted by @BLaw. \u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) September 5, 2019\n\nJohn noted in his post last night that, as of close of business yesterday, the original Bloomberg story about Olson\u2019s departure from the Labor Department still read, \u201cTrump Labor Aide Quits After Anti-Semitic Facebook Posts Surface.\u201d No one was calling the posts \u201canti-semitic\u201d anymore, though \u2014 not the ADL, which retreated on Tuesday, and not Labor, which has now admitted error and rehired Olson. Absurdly, Bloomberg had spent the past three days defending its hatchet job on Olson by noting that the ADL and the Labor Department each agreed that his sarcastic Facebook posts were \u201canti-semitic,\u201d even though we don\u2019t know what information Bloomberg did \u2014 and didn\u2019t \u2014 share with each organization when it brought Olson\u2019s posts to their attention.\n\nAnd even if both organizations did find Olson\u2019s posts offensive, in no way does that absolve Bloomberg\u2019s editors of their own lapse in judgment in letting the original story be published. Whether the Olson story was fair doesn\u2019t, and can\u2019t, depend on whether a dopey bureaucrat at the Labor Department who was eager to avoid bad press for his agency behaved rashly in leaping to axe a new employee.\n\nThe headline of the original Bloomberg story has now been changed to \u201cTrump Labor Aide Quits After Facebook Posts Surface.\u201d No more \u201canti-semitism\u201d reference \u2014 but no retraction either. They haven\u2019t even issued a correction, even though the story continues to insist that Olson\u2019s appointment \u201craises more questions about the Trump administration\u2019s vetting system for political appointees\u201d (why?) and contains factual errors about Olson\u2019s legal career.\n\nInstead, Bloomberg has published a follow-up story reporting on Olson\u2019s reinstatement by the Labor Department. Interestingly, this one was written by editor Terence Hyland, not reporter Ben Penn, who wrote the original hit piece and then spent the day on Twitter defending it on grounds that Olson had been working on wage-hour regulations for the Trump White House. \u201cThey\u2019re now down one adviser,\u201d he crowed after Olson was temporarily forced out. Why do you suppose Bloomberg didn\u2019t trust Penn to write the story about his reinstatement?\n\nAlex Griswold savors the irony of this clusterfark happening so soon after a media freakout about right-wing operatives vetting their social-media posts for offensive material. Only the media can be trusted to fairly and responsibly scrutinize and contextualize people\u2019s Twitter archives, we were told:\n\nBloomberg knows as well as I do that the outcry won\u2019t be sustained, and it can ride the controversy out. Fellow reporters will not treat the Olson affair as a permanent black eye for Bloomberg or Penn the way they did for Andrew Breitbart after the Shirley Sherrod affair. To bring things full circle, the prospect of reporters getting unjustly sacked because of old posts received more sustained outrage than when a man outside their in-group was unjustly fired. Olson gets to go to work today, but so does Penn, with nary a mention on CNN or a biting rebuke from the Times. Who expected otherwise?\n\nTen days later after the \u201cright-wing operatives\u201d panic, we\u2019re standing on the rubble of Bloomberg\u2019s reputation, with the organization not only seemingly dead set against acknowledging obvious error but allegedly instructing employees not to do so either. That\u2019s media accountability in 2019, at least when a right-wing grievance is concerned. Exit question: Did anyone at all edit Penn\u2019s original story before it went live on Bloomberg\u2019s website?
