For us it\u2019s just the same every week.\n\n\u201cThere will still be difficult moments this season but against Arsenal we got our rewards.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFleck added: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously great for the fans that we got a result.\n\n\u201cThe problem with the last few games at home is we have played well and got nothing from the games so it was important that we got a big victory and we have done that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not too sure how people will react to it. For us it\u2019s just the same every week, we always try and work as hard as we can and get our rewards at the end of the game and on this occasion, we\u2019ve done that.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nVictory ended a run of three successive home defeats and moved United up to ninth in the table.\n\nWilder's side face West Ham this weekend at the London Stadium, with talkSPORT presenter Jason Cundy claiming he could be the right choice to replace Unai Emery at Arsenal, if the Gunners were to dispense with the Spaniard.\n\n\u201cLook at the way Wilder set his team up on Monday,\" he declared on Monday. \"Arsenal need a manager who\u2019s astute defensively, but still carries a threat going forward.\n\n\u201cChris Wilder is working on a completely different budget but he outclassed Emery. Could they do any worse than Chris Wilder?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things to like about him. Where he came from, he\u2019s humble and speaks the truth. Look at his comments about his goalkeeper [Dean Henderson] recently.\n\n\u201cArsenal need someone [like him]. Could he get a tune out of Mesut Ozil? I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s what they need.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine Chris Wilder managing Arsenal? You can\u2019t, because they wouldn\u2019t go for someone like that. He\u2019s seen as unfashionable. But could he have turned Arsenal into a different animal since Arsene Wenger left?\u201d", "description": "Chris Wilder's Blades defeated Unai Emery's Gunners 1-0 on Monday night at Bramall Lane", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703637.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sheffield-United-FC-vs-Arsenal-FC-United-Kingdom-21-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
