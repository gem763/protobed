It rocked Warren Gatland\u2019s camp ahead of their tournament opener with Georgia.\n\nRob Howley faces uncertain future with long wait for betting verdict Read more\n\nThe Wales squad were then reminded of their responsibilities by World Rugby. The briefing was prearranged as part of the tournament\u2019s rules and not held in direct response to Howley\u2019s departure. World Rugby has given similar advice to all World Cup teams, and Wales hooker Ken Owens believes Gatland\u2019s players are more than clear on their responsibilities.\n\n\u201cAll the boys get integrity briefings and reminders every season in terms of anti-doping, betting, and all the rest of it. Everyone is aware,\u201d Owens said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear. We had an integrity briefing the day after the announcement with Rob. We all know where we stand. The Welsh Rugby Players Association have had a new chief executive start last week and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get across all of that in the next week or so.\u201d\n\nOwens \u2013 who is the chairman of the WRPA \u2013 is one of Wales\u2019 most experienced players and the senior figures in Gatland\u2019s squad have stepped up in the wake of Howley\u2019s departure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult. It\u2019s been a bit of a shell shock to the boys,\u201d Owens said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had time to reflect or dwell too much on it because we have got a job to do. As harsh as it sounds, that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do and that\u2019s what the focus has been for the last two years.\n\n\u201cWe heard the news on the day off, we\u2019ve had two training days, and they\u2019ve been pretty sharp. We\u2019ve just got on with it. Monday is a massive game against Georgia. We\u2019ve all spoken, as we did at the start of the tournament, about there being no excuses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re never short of a little bit of adversity in Welsh rugby or a story breaking in a match week. We\u2019ve just had to get on with it and use it as a galvanising force. That\u2019s all we can do.\u201d\n\nWales were given a day off on Friday ahead of Gatland naming his team to face Georgia on Saturday.\n\nIn the Six Nations, Wales put the controversial abandonment of a proposed merger between two of the country\u2019s sides \u2013 Scarlets and Ospreys \u2013 to one side and went on to win the Grand Slam.\n\nThey plan to circle the wagons again in similar fashion in Toyota where they face Georgia. Stephen Jones has arrived here to replace Howley as attack coach.\n\nNeil Jenkins, the Wales skills coach and former halfback partner of Howley, said: \u201cI have spoken to Rob. He was OK. I don\u2019t want to say any more. It is pretty private as far as I am concerned.\n\n\u201cWe are desperate for a match. If I am brutally honest, I wish we were playing tomorrow. I can\u2019t wait to get going. It is obviously very difficult. He (Howley) is a very close friend of mine. It\u2019s not ideal, but it is what it is. It\u2019s happened and we have to move forward.\u201d", "description": "Wales players were given an integrity briefing the morning after news broke Rob Howley had been sent home from the Rugby World Cup for a suspected breach of betting rules.", "authors": ["Alex Bywater"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2832dee90efb0fe8be9d4749b09f6e33d6ab362e/160_107_1462_877/master/1462.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c1df2be96e33074a0d70be2c1d13afd3", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
