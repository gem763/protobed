Dr. Wen blamed her sacking on disagreements over her reorienting the organization further from abortion politics and more toward its role as a women\u2019s health provider. In her letter, Dr. Wen wrote she believed that de-emphasizing \u201cabortion care is the best way to protect it.\u201d \u201cHowever,\u201d she went on, \u201cthere is a vocal minority\u201d including many national staff and board members \u201cwho prefer a stridently political, abortion-first philosophy.\u201d (NYT)\n\nWhile she said she had \u201cno desire to harm the organization,\u201d she did signal that legal action could be forthcoming.\n\n\u201cI have no desire to file claims against Planned Parenthood for defamation, retaliation, or discrimination,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOn Twitter, Wen expressed her disappointment that her letter was leaked.\n\nI am very disappointed that my confidential letter to @PPFA Board is leaked to @nytimes. There should be no dispute regarding the terms of my employment contract. I will not be forced to sign a gag clause and compromise my integrity.
