It ended with the voiceover of Jesse writing the letter to Brock and so, in the initial draft, the audience would\u2019ve heard what was in the letter.\n\n\u2018That was one thing I fought for. I remember, it was before we started shooting, probably the fourth or fifth time I read through the script and I noticed that the ending was different. I was like \u201cwait\u2026why? Why has this gone?\u201d and I called Vince [Gilligan] and asked \u201cWhy did you take out the letter?!\u201d\n\n\u2018He\u2019s this southern gentleman, just such a great man, such a beautiful sweet accent, he went \u201cI just felt it was kind of a downer reminding people what had happened, and I don\u2019t know, it just felt a little sad\u201d,\u2019 he revealed.\n\nBrock was the only person Jesse said goodbye to (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018I disagreed with him and I fought until the end of the shoot to at least have me record the voice over,\u2019 Aaron continued. \u2018There\u2019s a small scene of him in the little secret cabinet that he was hiding in in the moving truck, where he comes out.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a scene in there where he\u2019s writing a letter and you\u2019re not sure who he\u2019s writing it to, but you sort of get a glimpse. Then next time you see that letter is when he hands it to good old Robert Forster.\u2019\n\n\u2018That was the one thing I took from the set, I took the letter,\u2019 Aaron concluded \u2013 but stopped shy of telling us anything about its contents, the spoil sport.\n\nJesse left his old life behind in the final moments of El Camino (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018I wish I could tell you, it\u2019s such a beautiful letter, it\u2019s so well thought out,\u2019 he teased.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s actually the first thing that Vince wrote when he wrote the script, was that letter. The very first thing he wrote, he wrote a letter to Brock from Jesse, which is just\u2026 so beautiful.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019ll never know the full content of the letter, as it hit the cutting room floor along with numerous other scenes that will never see the light of day.\n\n\u2018The original cut of this film was just under three hours. It was two-hours and 57mins? So about a third of it was cut,\u2019 Aaron added.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018A lot of that was just trimming of scenes, some scenes were able to breathe a little longer, but then there was full-on scenes that were cut either from the script or from the final cut, or from the initial cut. There was stuff that was cut even before we started shooting.\u2019\n\nThe fate of Brock remained unknown throughout El Camino, with the death of his mother still recent in the timeline of the series.\n\nMore: Netflix Matt Bomer hides sinister secret after killer car crash in first trailer for The Sinner 3 Living With Yourself review: Double Paul Rudd isn't necessarily double the fun Best vegan documentaries to stream on Netflix as The Game Changers launches\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that out of everyone that had been caught up in the trouble started by Heisenberg and the blue meth trade he was dragged into, Jesse felt the most guilty about the young boy\u2019s unwitting involvement.\n\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad movie is available now on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
