There was a furious backlash in Congress, including from some of Trump\u2019s closest allies, who accused the president of betraying the Kurds.\n\nThe decision represents the latest in a series of erratic moves by Trump, who is fighting impeachment at home, apparently taken without consultation with, or knowledge of, US diplomats dealing with Syria, or the UK and France, the US\u2019s main international partners in the country.\n\nA White House statement on Sunday night after his conversation with his Turkish counterpart said that: \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria\u201d, adding that US forces were being removed from the area.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Monday its US partners had already begun withdrawing troops from areas along Turkey\u2019s border. Footage aired on Kurdish news agency Hawar purportedly showed US armoured vehicles evacuating key positions in the border region.\n\nThe SDF spokesman, Mustafa Bali, accused the US of leaving the area to \u201cturn into a war zone\u201d, adding that the SDF would \u201cdefend north-east Syria at all costs\u201d.\n\nBut on Monday the Pentagon, which has been cooperating with Turkey along the Syrian border, issued a statement saying: \u201cThe department of defence made clear to Turkey \u2013 as did the president \u2013 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in northern Syria. The US armed forces will not support or be involved in any such operation.\u201d\n\nState department officials also sought to minimize the announcement, telling reporters that only about two dozen American troops would be removed from the Turkey-Syria border, and suggesting that Turkey might not go through with a large-scale invasion.\n\nIn the face of fierce criticism from both political rivals and allies in Congress, Trump took to Twitter to try to defend the move and threaten Turkey.\n\n\u201cI held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!),\u201d he said.\n\nIt was unclear however, what was \u201coff limits\u201d.\n\nIn earlier tweets, Trump had appeared unsentimental about the Kurds, noting that they had been paid \u201cmassive amounts of money and equipment\u201d in the four year campaign, when they were used as the main US proxy to fight Isis in Syria.\n\nBut the issue of Isis foreign fighters, most of them European, has clearly preoccupied the US president.\n\nRelated: Inside al-Hawl camp, the incubator for Islamic State's resurgence\n\nBoth Trump and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have repeatedly called on European states to repatriate around 20,000 foreign nationals currently held in north-east Syria for trial and rehabilitation at home.\n\nTrump argued it was up to Turkey and Europe and others, \u201cto watch over the captured Isis fighters and families\u201d.\n\nAn SDF spokesman, Amjed Osman, said on Monday it was not clear what would happen to the prisoners. \u201cWe repeatedly called for foreign states to take responsibility for their Isis nationals. But there was no response,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nIt is far from clear if Turkey has the capacity \u2013 or desire \u2013 to take custody of the detainees being held in crowded Kurdish jails and displacement camps, stretching the SDF to its limits and prompting warnings that militants are using the prisons to regroup.", "description": "Trump\u2019s latest move has officials scrambling to understand the implications as Turkish forces gather near the Syrian borderTurkish fighters gather near the north-east Syrian border in preparation of a widely-anticipated invasion.
