I was quite hysterical about it but no one threatened me with arrest at all.\u2019\n\nA BTP spokesperson said arresting someone for fare evasion is a last resort, and only happens if they can\u2019t provide a method of payment, or a name and address for where a penalty fare can be sent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, the spokesperson said: \u2018Shortly after 6pm on 16 October, an 18-year-old man was arrested at Oxford Circus station on suspicion of fare evasion.\n\n\u2018Following efforts by officers to deescalate the situation, officers charged the man\u2019s phone which meant he was able to use his phone to tap out of the TfL network.\n\n\u2018He was then de-arrested and was allowed to continue his journey.\u2019\n\nSTOP AND SEARCH A British Transport Police spokesperson said the boy at Oxford Circus was not detained under the force\u2019s extended stop and search powers, but because he was under suspicion of fare evasion. However, if you find yourself being stopped by the police, remember, you do have rights and you should get to know them. Youth stop and search project Y-Stop has developed these handy tips for helping you deal with a stop and search. These can be memorised using the acronym S.E.A.R.C.H. Stay Calm \u2013 keep yourself calm at all times to help ensure a clear and quick resolution. Eye Contact \u2013 be polite so that it makes it harder for anger or fear to better you. Ask Questions \u2013 this not a confrontation. Ask questions about the process as the police need to account for themselves. Receipt \u2013 get written proof of the search and ensure that this has been completed truthfully. Record \u2013 you have a right to record the search, but politely inform the officer you are getting out a recording device to film them. Confidence \u2013 know your rights. Hold to account \u2013 following the above steps can encourage the police to behave properly.", "description": "A teenager was put in handcuffs and surrounded by officers when his phone died and he couldn\u2019t tap out at Oxford Circus.
