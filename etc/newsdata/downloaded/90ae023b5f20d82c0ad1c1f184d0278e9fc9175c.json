Don\u2019t use that word if it\u2019s not true. Do not. If I threaten somebody, you\u2019ll know it,\" Conway told reporters on the White House driveway.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"What does that mean, cover her personal life?\" a reporter asked.\n\n\"Don\u2019t use the word threaten. Don\u2019t use the word investigate,\" Conway replied. \"Stop being so silly.\"\n\nConway faced questions on Fox News and from reporters at the White House a day after The Washington Examiner posted audio and a transcript of her tense call with one if its reporters over a report that she was reportedly floated as a chief of staff candidate.\n\nIn the conversation, Conway objected that a story written by the reporter, Caitlin Yilek, mentioned that her husband George Conway George Thomas ConwayReporter posts heated phone call with Kellyanne Conway Trump says US is building a wall in Colorado Lawmakers, social media users praise photo of Pelosi confronting Trump MORE is a fierce critic of President Trump Donald John TrumpCharles Barkley: 'Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up' Democrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report Trump plans to appeal House subpoena for financial records to Supreme Court MORE on Twitter. Conway criticized Yilek's work and dismissed the relevance of her husband in writing about her.\n\nOn Friday, Conway called the story \"lazy\" and again questioned Yilek's work.\n\n\"Why do you call yourself a breaking news reporter if you\u2019re not writing breaking news and you\u2019re not even being a reporter?\" Conway said. \"Don\u2019t characterize the way I feel without ever having met me, talked to me or called me for a story.\"\n\nYilek is also a former reporter at The Hill.\n\nAudio of the call circulated on social media after it was posted Thursday afternoon. On the call, Conway questions why Yilek felt the need to include her husband's tweets.\n\n\"He gets his power through me, if you haven\u2019t noticed,\" Conway said. \"Not the other way around. And if these are the, quote, standards, unquote, at the Washington Examiner, then yes, I\u2019d be happy to talk to your editor. But I\u2019ve known your editor since before you were born. So, I can call your editor either way. I\u2019m just trying to give you a chance to explain why you think what you wrote qualifies as breaking news or reporting.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the call, Conway suggests that Yilek's personal life would be fair game to explore.\n\n\u201cListen, if you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, then we\u2019re welcome to do the same around here,\" Conway told Yilek.", "description": "White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Friday dug in amid criticism of her conduct on a call with a Washington Examiner reporter,\u00a0calling\u00a0it \"silly\" to suggest she had threatened\u00a0the journalist when she\u00a0said it\u00a0would be", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/conwaykellyanne_10252019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
