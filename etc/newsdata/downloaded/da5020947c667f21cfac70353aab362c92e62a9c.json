It says burlesque,\u201d says Vegas, who once took her parents to the show to demystify the performance.\n\n\u201cAfter the show they were like, hmmm, nice job.\u201d\n\nAnother dancer, Sapphire Flex, says burlesque is about \u201cthe tease\u201d rather than \u201cthe strip\u201d.\n\nShe says her mother struggled to accept her new career, until she took her to one of her performances.\n\nNow \u201cmy mom is my number one fan and she comes to every show,\u201d she says.\n\nSapphire also won over her partner: \u201cI\u2019ve had him on stage which is pretty cool.\u201d\n\nAfter warming up \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019ve gotta be able to do the splits\u201d says the group\u2019s leader Francesca \u2014 the dancers take the stage.\n\n\u201cWe are all immersed in our art, so for us it\u2019s all about passion,\u201d she says.\n\nAnother dancer, La Minx, joined the Tre Magnifique burlesque group just two weeks before the sexpo.\n\nShe says the burlesque shows have given her new confidence in her body, although she had to down a shot of Jaegermeister for courage before going on stage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very self-conscious,\u201d says La Minx.\n\nShe did not give her real name because her involvement is a secret.\n\n\u201cMy parents are pastors. They know nothing about this,\u201d she says, wearing ripped stockings and a bedazzled silver bra.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t understand it\u2026 To them it\u2019s like, what are you doing? You are showing too much!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I love it! It\u2019s been what I needed to be honest,\u201d she adds.", "description": "Pretoria (AFP) \u2013 The dancers are getting ready by unleashing a blur of feather boas and corsets on the dressing room, where stacks of eyeshadow form", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/474bde_burlesque-is-combinination-dance-comedy-theatre-skimpy-costumes-meant-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
