The Kurds disputed the figure, saying 29 of its fighters were dead. Four Turkish soldiers have also been killed since the beginning of the offensive, including two who were killed in Syria's northwest.\n\nDespite the rising bloodshed, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu dismissed an offer by US President Donald Trump to mediate between Ankara and YPG forces.\n\n\"We don't mediate, negotiate with terrorists. The only thing to be done is for these terrorists to lay down arms,\" Cavusoglu told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.\n\n\"We tried the political solution in Turkey in the past and we saw what happened,\" he added.\n\nFrom Akcakale, Al Jazeera's Stratford said Turkish \"armoured personnel carriers, tanks and heavy military equipment\" had continued \"pouring towards the border\".\n\n\"Despite increasing international condemnation, there is no sign whatsoever of the Turkish military pulling back,\" he added.", "description": "Turkey's military push into Syria meets growing backlash amid battle with Kurdish-led forces for control of Ras al-Ain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/12/79d404f9d4a7440bbfaca9dd50f3d2af_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
