REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis/File Photo\n\nATHENS (Reuters) - Greece has received two bids for a license to build and operate a casino resort in a long-delayed tourist development in Athens, the country\u2019s gaming commission said on Friday.\n\nBids were submitted by Hard Rock International and by U.S. casino operator Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment jointly with Greek contractor GEK Terna (HRMr.AT), the commission said.\n\nThe bid deadline for the construction and 30-year operation of the casino resort expired at 0800 GMT on Friday.\n\nThe winner of the tender, which is expected to be named by the end of November, will build a casino of at least 1.2 hectares, with at least 120 gaming tables and 1,200 slot machines, as well as a luxury hotel, a conference center and a sports center.\n\nThe casino will be part of a planned 8 billion-euro ($9 billion) resort known as Hellenikon, built by developer Lamda (LMDr.AT) on the site of a disused Athens airport.\n\nHellenikon is expected to bring in hundreds of thousands of tourists every year, a major boost to the country\u2019s economy which has been recovering after a multi-year debt crisis.\n\nHowever, the project, part of a post-bailout agreement between Greece and its lenders, has faced bureaucratic delays amid a long-running row with critics who fear it will damage the environment and the country\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\nThe new conservative government has pledged to speed up necessary licensing for Hellenikon and wrap up the casino tender, key conditions before Lamda takes over the project by the end of the year and pays 300 million euros ($329 million) in a first tranche for the project.\n\nHard Rock International has said it plans to spend more than 1 billion euros on the project.", "description": "Greece has received two bids for a license to build and operate a casino resort in a long-delayed tourist development in Athens, the country's gaming commission said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436966408&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930O2", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
