The economy\u2019s waning fortunes have been blamed on the Trump administration\u2019s year-long trade war with China, which has eroded business sentiment and plunged U.S. and global manufacturing into recession.\n\n\u201cThe softening in job growth should surprise no one but it doesn\u2019t mean the economy is headed toward a recession right away,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. \u201cHouseholds still have the income to keep spending.\u201d\n\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 130,000 jobs last month, flattered by temporary hiring of 25,000 workers for the 2020 census. The economy created 20,000 fewer jobs in June and July than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 158,000 jobs in August.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shrugged off the slowdown in job growth, tweeting \u201cGood Jobs Numbers,\u201d and claiming that \u201cChina is eating the Tariffs.\u201d\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said the employment report offered \u201clittle comfort in an economy faltering under the Trump administration\u2019s reckless agenda to undermine the health, financial security and well-being of the American people.\u201d\n\nWashington and Beijing slapped fresh tariffs on each other on Sunday. The duties are paid by U.S. companies importing the goods. While the two economic giants on Thursday agreed to hold high-level talks in early October in Washington, uncertainty over trade lingers.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in Zurich, Switzerland, on Friday he was not forecasting or expecting a recession, but reiterated the U.S. central bank would continue to act \u201cas appropriate\u201d to keep the longest expansion in history on track. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates again this month after lowering borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.\n\nA seasonal quirk could account for last month\u2019s less-than-expected increase in employment. Over the past several years, the initial August job count has tended to exhibit a weak bias, with revisions subsequently showing strength.\n\nBut slower job growth is also in line with sharp declines in both the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing and services industries employment measures in August.\n\nJob gains have averaged 156,000 over the last three months, still above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7% for a third straight month in August as 571,000 people, the most in 10 months, entered the labor force.\n\nThe dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.\n\nJob growth slowed since mid-2018. Economists say it is unclear whether the loss of momentum in hiring was due to ebbing demand for labor or a shortage of qualified workers.\n\nThe government last month estimated that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade. That suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000.\n\nThe revised payrolls data will be published next February.\n\nMANUFACTURING STRUGGLING\n\nAverage hourly earnings gained 0.4% last month, the largest increase since February, after rising 0.3% in July. The annual increase in wages dipped to 3.2% from 3.3% in July as last year\u2019s surge dropped out of the calculation.\n\nWage growth has held at or above 3.0% for 13 straight month, helping to drive consumer spending and the economy. The average workweek rose to 34.4 hours in August from 34.3 hours in July. A measure of hours worked, which is a proxy for gross domestic product, increased 0.4% after falling 0.2% in July.\n\n\u201cThis is indicating that firms aren\u2019t yet reducing labor input at the intensive margin,\u201d said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.\n\nThe labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, increased to 63.2% last month from 63.0% in July. The employment-to-population rate increased two-tenths of a percentage point to 60.9%, the highest since December 2008.\n\nBut a broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, rose to 7.2% from a more than 18-year low of 7.0% in July.\n\nThe slowdown in hiring last month was across all sectors, with the exception of government, which was boosted by recruitment for the 2020 decennial census.\n\nPrivate payrolls rose by only 96,000 jobs in August. Leading the slowdown was manufacturing, where employment rose by a tepid 3,000 jobs last month after increasing 4,000 in July. Manufacturing has ironically borne the brunt of the Trump administration\u2019s trade war, which the White House has argued is intended to boost the sector.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Job seekers line up at TechFair in Los Angeles, California, U.S. March 8, 2018.

The manufacturing workweek rose 0.2 hours to 40.6 hours in August, but factories continued to reduce overtime for workers.\n\nConstruction payrolls increased by 14,000 jobs last month after slipping by 2,000 in July. Retail employment dropped by 11,100 jobs, extending a decline that started in February.\n\nGovernment employment jumped by 34,000 jobs. There were increases in professional and business services, healthcare, leisure and hospitality, financial activities and wholesale trade employment.", "description": "U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August, with retail hiring declining for a seventh straight month, but strong wage gains should support consumer spending and keep the economy expanding moderately amid rising threats from trade tensions.", "authors": ["Lucia Mutikani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426913710&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850JG", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
