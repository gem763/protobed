The PM asked the EU to waive or simplify customs rules to keep cross-border trade on the island of Ireland as frictionless as possible.\n\nBut Brussels did not want to do that and expressed concerns about how practical the suggested watered-down checks would be.\n\nThe PM also proposed giving the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote every four years on whether to continued with the border arrangements.\n\nDublin said that would effectively give the DUP a veto at Stormont and suggested it could not sign up to it.\n\nWhat did Mr Johnson and Mr Varadkar agree yesterday?\n\nThe short answer is we don't know exactly. The two leaders met for three hours of talks and said afterwards they believed they had found a 'pathway to a possible deal'.\n\nBrexit summits have been notoriously leaky in the past but this one has remained relatively leak-free.\n\nThe lack of any briefing by either side has been taken by seasoned Brussels watchers as a sure fire sign that something serious is in the works and that a way forward could yet be found.\n\nWhat was Boris Johnson's original five-point plan to scrap the Irish backstop? Single market Northern Ireland would leave the Customs' Union with the rest of the UK but stay in the single market. This would constitute an 'all island regulatory zone' that covers trade of all goods. It would mean no checks between the two nations, because Northern Ireland would still have to follow EU rules. Goods from Britain to Northern Ireland would effectively be managed by a border in the Irish Sea, with checks only in that direction, not the reverse. Stormont Lock The 'all island regulatory zone' will have to be approved by the people of Northern Ireland. This means the Northern Ireland Assembly has the right to veto the zone and could hold a referendum on the matter. Customs checks Customs checks would have to be put in place on trade between Northern and the Republic of Ireland. Most checks would be made using technology, but some would still have to be physical. Cash for Northern Ireland A promise of a 'new deal for Northern Ireland' means ministers putting money aside for Belfast and Dublin to help aide economic development and ensure new measures work. Keeping to the Good Friday agreement Freedom of movement between two countries will remain. New deal would confirm commitment to collobaration between UK and Ireland.\n\nSo how are the two sides going to resolve the customs row?\n\nIt is thought that Mr Johnson may have agreed to replace his original customs plan with a much more complicated proposal which would effectively see Northern Ireland in both the EU's and UK's customs zones.\n\nIn a so-called 'customs partnership' Northern Ireland would still leave the customs union with the rest of the UK but an administrative customs border would be put up in the Irish Sea.\n\nIn practice that would mean that any goods travelling from mainland UK to Ulster would be subject to customs checks and tariffs to make sure everything was EU compliant.\n\nThe UK would collect tariffs on goods on behalf of the EU.\n\nBut because Northern Ireland would technically be part of the UK's customs zone businesses there would be able to claim a rebate if they were left out of pocket.\n\nBecause goods would be checked in the Irish Sea - most likely at ports - there would not be any need for inspections at the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, allowing goods to move freely around the island of Ireland.\n\nIn simple terms there would be a bureaucratic border between the UK and Northern Ireland.\n\nWhat about the consent issue?\n\nHow the Northern Ireland Assembly will have a say on the border arrangements remains a sticking point.\n\nA compromise solution has not yet been made clear but in order for the talks to have entered the 'tunnel' some sort of broad plan is likely to have been identified as a possible way forward.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nNegotiators representing Britain and the EU are now locked in intensive negotiations to try to thrash out an agreed divorce deal.\n\nAccelerated negotiations will take place over the weekend, in the hope of a divorce deal being rubber-stamped at the final EU summit before Brexit.\n\nThat summit is due to take place on October 17-18, less than two weeks before the October 31 Brexit departure date.", "description": "Boris Johnson received a major Brexit boost today after the EU agreed to enter into formal talks on a potential divorce deal ahead of a crunch summit next week.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/17/19597832-0-image-a-24_1570810119507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
