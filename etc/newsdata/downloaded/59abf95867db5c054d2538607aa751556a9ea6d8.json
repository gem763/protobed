I\u2019ve edited skittering, half-finished sentences to present them in some kind of consequential order and repeated remarks that made little sense.\n\nIn most circumstances, presenting information in as intelligible a form as possible is what we are trained for. But the shock I felt hearing half an hour of unfiltered meanderings from the president of the United States made me wonder whether the editing does our readers a disservice.\n\nI\u2019ve read so many stories about his bluster and boasting and ill-founded attacks, I\u2019ve listened to speeches and hours of analysis, and yet I was still taken back by just how disjointed and meandering the unedited president could sound. Here he was trying to land the message that he had delivered at least something towards one of his biggest campaign promises and sounding like a construction manager with some long-winded and badly improvised sales lines.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lenore Taylor", "Theguardian.Com Commentisfree Sep As-A-Foreign-Reporter-Visiting-The-Us-I-Was-Stunned-By-Trumps-Press-Conference"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
