It would have killed me.\n\n\"You're either going to end up a crazy child star who dies at whatever age, or you're going to live life and actually get on with it,\" Payne said of his life post-One D, noting he finally knows how to drive and has spent the past couple years figuring out \"how to be a person.\"\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND - JUNE 25: Liam Payne attends The Summer Party 2019 Presented By Serpentine Galleries And Chanel at The Serpentine Gallery on June 25, 2019 in London, England.

But it's taken him a while to learn how to process the fame he was suddenly catapulted into after that fateful 2010 X-Factor audition that launched One Direction.\n\nSudden fame was overwhelming, Payne said. And he often tried to cope with the relentless tour and writing schedule (One Direction released five albums and performed four international tours between 2011 and 2015) with alcohol.\n\n\"It scared the (expletive) out of me,\" he said of the band's success. \"You have to realize what the possibilities are. I feel like I was a little bit in self-destruct mode because I knew it was going really well. Success is the bit that'll kill you, more than anything... You've got no control over your life. I lost complete control over everything.\"\n\nZayn Malik left the band in March 2015, sending fans into a frenzy months before the four remaining members, Payne, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlin, announced the \"break\" in August that turned into an indefinite hiatus. The five have since released their own solo projects, with no reunion in sight. Is Payne still close with the other guys?\n\nFormer One Direction members Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson.

Everyone goes to work, you have people you associate with at work, but you don't see them outside of work. We don't really have a job together anymore. With someone like Harry, for example, I don't have very much in common with the boy. I can go have a drink with him. Fine, whatever. We just don't really have much in common.\"\n\nDespite the rough patches, Payne now reports he's the \"happiest I've ever been in my life. I feel like everything's working out nicely now.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/16/one-direction-fame-would-have-killed-liam-payne-he-reflects/3995344002/", "description": "Four years after One Direction's split, Liam Payne is opening up about how international superstardom affected his well-being.", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Published A.M.
