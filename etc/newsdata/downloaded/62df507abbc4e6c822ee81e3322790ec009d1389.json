Bethesda are asking for a \u00a399.99 a year, or \u00a311.99 a month, to gain premium membership for Fallout 1st.\n\nIt\u2019s not a new game but instead the chance to play Fallout 76 on your own private server. You also get a scrapbox with unlimited storage, a special survival tent that works as a fast travel point and has a stash and sleeping bag, a gift of 1,650 Atoms (the in-game currency) per month, the Ranger armour outfit from Fallot: New Vegas, and various unique icons and emotes.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking that doesn\u2019t sound like much then you\u2019re not the only one but the real appeal is simply that it\u2019s your world, that only you and up to seven friends (who don\u2019t need subscriptions) have access to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough that\u2019d be a lot more appealing if it supported fan-made mods, but it won\u2019t until sometime after Fallout 1st launches.\n\nThe added extras are a little underwhelming\n\nFallout 76 is just coming up to its first year anniversary, but it was nothing short of a disaster when it first started, with tedious quests and gameplay, and horribly outdated, glitchy graphics.\n\nIt did get better but mainstream interest seemed to quickly fade away and it\u2019s only hardcore fans left now, so in that context the expensive subscription makes more sense. Especially as it is a fairly standard price for a private server in other games.\n\nThere\u2019s no start date yet for Fallout 1st, but you can read up more on Bethesda\u2019s website.\n\nWe do think they probably should\u2019ve waited for mod support though, especially as the long awaited Wastelanders update, which will add non-player characters, has been delayed into 2020.\n\nFallout 1st \u2013 people aren\u2019t going to be happy this armour is an exclusive\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Fallout 76 power armour helmet recall as 20,000 pose health risk\n\nMORE: Fallout 76 gets human NPCs, battle royale mode, and free trial\n\nMORE: Bethesda did make canvas bags for Fallout 76 but gave them to influencers", "description": "For just \u00a311.99 a month you can rent your own private server and create a Fallout 76 world that only you and your friends can access.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WCCFfallout7639-3452_1571852006.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
