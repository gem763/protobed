Soap bosses are yet to reveal how Ellis will depart the soap, after he was abruptly axed last week\n\nWHAT IS SEPSIS? Sepsis, known as the \u2018silent killer\u2019, strikes when an infection such as blood poisoning sparks a violent immune response in which the body attacks its own organs. It is the leading cause of avoidable death, killing at least 44,000 a year, and the Daily Mail has long campaigned for more awareness. If caught early, the infection can be controlled by antibiotics before the body goes into overdrive - ultimately leading to death within a matter of minutes. But the early symptoms of sepsis can be easily confused with more mild conditions, meaning it can be difficult to diagnose. Sepsis has similar symptoms to flu, gastroenteritis and a chest infection. These include: S lurred speech or confusion\n\nlurred speech or confusion E xtreme shivering or muscle pain\n\nxtreme shivering or muscle pain P assing no urine in a day\n\nassing no urine in a day S evere breathlessness\n\nevere breathlessness I t feels like you are dying\n\nt feels like you are dying S kin mottled or discoloured Symptoms in children are: Fast breathing\n\nFits or convulsions\n\nMottled, bluish or pale skin\n\nRashes that do not fade when pressed\n\nLethargy\n\nFeeling abnormally cold\n\nLast month Asan was sacked from Emmerdale after getting into a brawl with Hollyoaks star Jamie at the TV Choice Awards.\n\nThe actor was seen throwing a punch at Jamie during an explosive fight in front of shocked onlookers, shouting: 'I'm going to f*****g kill you'.\n\nAsan, who has been involved in a knife attack Emmerdale plot, could be heard shouting in a video obtained by the Mirror: 'Do you think you are a f*****g big man? I'm going to f*****g kill you. I'm going to f*****g knife you,' before attempting to take a swipe at Jamie.\n\nIt's fine! Ellis brushed off his injury and simply covered it in a bandage, rather than seek medical attention in hospital\n\nAfter the Asan threw the punch, I'm A Celebrity's Malique Thompson-Dwyer ran into the room to intervene and bundle Jamie out.\n\nAccording to reports, the pair had to be pulled apart by security twice at the Hilton Park Lane hotel in Mayfair, London, with Asan eventually being escorted off the premises by staff at around 11pm.\n\nEmmerdale announced that Asan had been sacked from the soap two days after footage surfaced of the brawl.\n\nWill he survive? Fans took to Twitter after watching the scenes to claim that Ellis will contract sepsis from the cut, setting the stage for his character to be killed off\n\nAn ITV spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Emmerdale suspended Asan N'Jie yesterday pending further investigation into an incident at a central London hotel on Monday night.\n\n'ITV executives have met with him this morning and as a consequence Asan's contract has been terminated with immediate effect.'\n\nIn a further statement given to MailOnline, Asan said: 'My behaviour at the TV Choice Awards was completely unacceptable and very much out of character.\n\nDrama: Asan was sacked by ITV from his role as Ellis Chapman on Emmerdale after threatening to 'knife' Hollyoaks actor Jamie at the TV Choice Awards last month\n\n'I sincerely apologise to everybody who has been affected especially Jamie Lomas, the whole Emmerdale team, our audience, ITV, my family, and the organisers of the TV Choice Awards. I am devastated, +accept full responsibility for my actions and I am determined to learn from this.'\n\nAsan's brawl with Jamie was reportedly sparked by a financial dispute with one of his co-stars.\n\nA source told The Sun that Asan allegedly goaded Jamie into lashing out, as the Hollyoaks star was awaiting commission for working with the star in the early days of his career.\n\nAccording to the source Jamie was managing Asan's co-star - who is yet to be named - at his First Take Acting school, and helped him land one of his first roles in Emmerdale.\n\nUpsetting: The actor was seen throwing a punch at Jamie (pictured) during an explosive fight in front of shocked onlookers, and he was sacked two days after the footage emerged\n\nThe actor in question had decided to leave Jamie's agency, but is yet to pay the full commission.
