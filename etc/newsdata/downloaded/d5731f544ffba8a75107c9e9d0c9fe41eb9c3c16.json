The company is also changed its name from VChain Technology to Zamna.\n\nWhen VChain-now-Zamna first appeared, I must admit I was confused. Using blockchain to verify passenger data seemed like a hammer to crack a nut. But it turns out to have some surprisingly useful applications.\n\nThe idea is to use it to verify and connect the passenger data sets which are currently silo-ed between airlines, governments and security agencies. By doing this, says Zamna, you can reduce the need for manual or other checks by up to 90 percent. If that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s quite a leap in efficiency.\n\nIn theory, as more passenger identities are verified digitally over time and shared securely between parties, using a blockchain in the middle to maintain data security and passenger privacy, the airport security process could become virtually seamless and allow passengers to sail through airports without needing physical documentation or repeated ID checks. Sounds good to me.\n\nZamna says its proprietary Advance Passenger Information (API) validation platform for biographic and biometric data, is already being deployed by some airlines and immigration authorities. It recently started working with Emirates Airline and the UAE\u2019s General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners (GDRFA) to deliver check-in and transit checks.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Zamna\u2019s platform is built on algorithms that check the accuracy of Advanced Passenger Information or biometric data, without having to share any of that data with third parties, because it attaches an anonymous token to the already verified data. Airlines, airports and governments can then access that secure, immutable and distributed network of validated tokens without having actually needing to \u2018see\u2019 the data an agency, or competing airline, holds. Zamna\u2019s technology can then be used by any of these parties to validate passengers\u2019 biographic and biometric data, using cryptography to check you are who you say you are.\n\nSo, what was wrong with the previous security measures in airports for airlines and border control that Zanma might be fixing?\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Irra Ariella Khi, co-founder and CEO of Zamna, says: \u201cThere is a preconception that when you arrive at the airport somehow \u2013 as if by magic \u2013 the airline knows who you are, the security agencies know who you are, and the governments of departure and destination both know that you are flying between their countries and have established that it is both legitimate and secure for you to do so. You may even assume that the respective security authorities have exchanged some intelligence about you as a passenger, to establish that both you and your fellow passengers are safe to board the same plane.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d she says, \u201cthe reality is far from this. There is no easy and secure way for airlines and government agencies to share or cross-reference your data \u2013 which remains siloed (for valid data protection reasons). They must, therefore, repeat manual one-off data checks each time you travel. Even if you have provided your identity data and checked in advance, and if you travel from the same airport on the same airline many times over, you will find that you are still subject to the same one-off passenger processing (which you have probably already experienced many times before). Importantly, there is an \u2018identity verification event\u2019, whereby the airline must check both the document of identity which you carry, as well as establish that it belongs to your physical identity.\u201d\n\nThere are three main trends in this space. Governments are demanding more accurate passenger data from airlines (for both departure and destination) \u2013 and increasing the regulatory fines imposed for incorrect data provided to them by the airlines. Secondly, Airlines also have to manage the repatriation of passengers and luggage if they are refused entry by a government due to incorrect data, which is costly. And thirdly, ETA (electronic transit authorizations, such as eVisas) are on the rise, and governments and airlines will need to satisfy themselves that a passenger\u2019s data matches exactly that of their relevant ETA in order to establish that they have correct status to travel. This is the case with ESTAs for all US-bound travelers. Many other countries have similar requirements. Critically for UK travelers \u2013 this will also be the case for all passengers traveling into Europe under the incoming ETIAS regulations.\n\nThe upshot is that airlines are imposing increased document and identity checks at the airports \u2013 regardless of whether the passenger has been a regular flier, and irrespective of whether they have checked-in in advance.\n\nZamna\u2019s data verification platform pulls together multiple stakeholders (airlines, governments, security agencies) with a way to validate and revalidate passenger identity and data (both biographic and biometric), and to securely establish data ownership \u2013 before passengers arrive at the airport.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t require any new infrastructure at the airport, and none of these entities have to share data, because the \u2018sharing without sharing\u2019 is performed by Zanma\u2019s blockchain platform in the middle of all the data sources.\n\nRemus Brett, Partner at LocalGlobe, says: \u201cWith passenger numbers expected to double in the next 20 years, new technology-driven solutions are the only way airlines, airports and governments will be able to cope. We\u2019re delighted to be working with the Zamna team and believe they can play a key role in addressing these challenges.\u201d Dupsy Abiola, Global Head of Innovation at International Airlines Group, adds: \u201cZamna is working with IAG on a digital transformation project involving British Airways and the other IAG carriers. It\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n\nZamna is a strategic partner to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and an active member of IATA\u2019s \u201cOne ID\u201d working group.", "description": "Zamna \u2014 which uses a blockchain to securely share and verify data between airlines and travel authorities to check passenger identities \u2014 has raised a $5m seed funding round led by VC firms LocalGlobe and Oxford Capital, alongside Seedcamp, the London Co-Investment Fund (LCIF), Telefonica, and a number of angel investors.
