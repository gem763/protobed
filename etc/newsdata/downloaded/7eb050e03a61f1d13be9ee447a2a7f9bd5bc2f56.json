A tremendously wet year led to flooding across the region, delaying crops from being planted and suppressing yields. This comes at the same time that sales to China and other overseas markets have plunged, exacerbating a yearslong slide in prices. Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural commodities remain a major sticking point in the ongoing trade negotiations, and the Chinese trade delegation recently cancelled a trip to farms in Nebraska and Montana, originally meant as a goodwill gesture. The Trump administration has offered up to $28 billion in farm aid, which has eased the pain but done nothing to restore lost markets.\n\nMidwestern states are also among the most manufacturing-intensive,and the U.S. factory sector is struggling mightily. The ISM manufacturing index fell this week to the lowest level since 2009, indicating that the weakness in the manufacturing sector is spreading. The Chicago Fed\u2019s Midwest Economy Index is a more localized measure of nonfarm business activity in Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, based on 129 indicators of manufacturing, construction and mining, services, and consumer spending. It turned negative in April, indicating below-average growth, and is now at the lowest level since 2010.\n\n\u2014Mark Vitner\n\n\n\n\n\nMisleading Indicator\n\nCommentary & Analysis\n\nby Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc.\n\nmfr.com\n\nOct. 3: Seasonally adjusted initial unemployment claims for the week ended on Sept. 28 rose by 4,000, to 219,000 from a revised 215,000 in the preceding span (originally 213,000). This week\u2019s result was modestly above the median forecast of 215,000. These data can be volatile from week to week (albeit not recently) and are thus usually best viewed on a smoothed basis. The four-week moving average was 212,000, which followed 212,000 last week and 213,000 before that.\n\nCyclically speaking, jobless claims are not a reliable leading indicator of recessions from a timing standpoint. They provided ample warning of both the 1990-91 and 2001 downturns, but scant advance notice of the 2008-09 slump. Therefore, while the labor market appears to be doing reasonably well at the moment, that fact does not guarantee it will continue to do so forever. Indeed, there are some reliable leading indicators of economic activity that are flashing warning signals (profit margins, the yield curve, a very wide spread between current conditions and expectations readings of consumer confidence and sentiment surveys, and shipments of recreational vehicles being the four most notable).\n\n\u2014Joshua Shapiro\n\n\n\n\n\nGood News for Autos\n\nAM Charts\n\nby BMO Capital Markets\n\nbmo.com\n\nOct. 3: The latest tally of U.S. auto sales surprised to the upside in September, topping 17.2 million annualized units. Expectations had been tempered by the early timing of the Labor Day holiday, which left fewer selling days this year (compared with last September) and pulled some purchases from the usually busy period into August. Smoothing out the monthly noise, sales were down a modest 0.2% year over year in the third quarter.\n\nBottom line: There is no big downshift for autos, yet. While the modest cyclical downtrend seemingly remains intact, unit sales have found support from a mix of still-strong consumer fundamentals, dialed up incentives, and higher fleet deliveries.\n\n\u2014Carl Campus\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety Net for Stocks\n\nMarket Perspective\n\nby Suntrust Advisory Services\n\nsuntrust.com\n\nOct. 3: Over the past three months, there have been 33 interest-rate cuts by global central banks (on a net basis), which compares with 19 rate hikes in the third quarter of 2018. Thus, accommodative global monetary policy should help cushion the market\u2019s downside.\n\nFurther, at the end of September 2018, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was above 3%; it is about half that level today. Consequently, the valuation of stocks to bonds is more attractive, and 60% of stocks in the S&P 500 index now have a dividend yield higher than that of the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield.\n\n\u2014Keith Lerner\n\n\n\n\n\nRecession Postponed\n\nMacro Tides\n\nby Smart Portfolios\n\nsmartportfolios.com\n\nOct. 2: Although the U.S. economy is likely to slow more in coming months, a recession is not likely, although the risks have increased. While the weakness in manufacturing is likely to cause a slowing in services, the weakness will not be so widespread as to result in a recession. The largest unknown and risk is the U.S.-China trade war. I do not think there will be a trade deal with China, which could cause volatility to increase in the stock market in October. If the S&P 500 falls below key support at 2650, consumer spending will weaken even more than expected, just as it did in the first quarter, after the S&P 500 plunged 20% in the fourth quarter of 2018.\u2026Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have been cutting rates, and we can expect more easing, which should provide the global economy with some support in the first half of 2020. The biggest surprise will come when Germany decides to implement fiscal stimulus to address its recession. This will provide a lift to the European Union and signal a reversal and move higher in global interest rates.\n\n\u2014Jim Welsh\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets and Impeachment\n\nMack Tracks\n\nby Mack Investment Securities\n\nmacktracks.com\n\nOct. 1: Headlines and airwaves are filled with claims and counterclaims regarding impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. During the 243 years since the founding of our great republic, there has been a limited history surrounding the impact of a presidential impeachment and its effects on the markets (thankfully).\n\nOnly two presidents were impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. In both cases, the Senate did not convict the then-sitting presidents, allowing them to continue in office. Richard Nixon, by contrast, was never impeached but resigned over the threat of impeachment on Aug. 9, 1974.\n\nThe Nixon years were embroiled in more than just political turmoil, including the fourth Arab-Israeli war, the OPEC oil embargo, and the worst stock market crash since the Great Depression. In today\u2019s world, equity markets may begin to struggle should political and economic uncertainties persist.\n\n\u2014Stephen W.
