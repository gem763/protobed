They want the second yellow shown by Alejandro Hernandez to be revoked.\n\nIf successful, Morata would be available to play against Real on Saturday.", "description": "Alvaro Morata is still furious with his sending off against Mallorca and had to be restrained when conducting an interview about the incident.", "authors": ["Will Griffee For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/12/18960428-0-image-a-27_1569496518099.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
