Williamson\u2019s weight was also a topic of conversation from when he entered the NBA Draft through the Summer League.\n\nZION WILLIAMSON TO BE OUT 6-8 WEEKS RECOVERING FROM KNEE SURGERY, NEW ORLEANS PELICANS SAY\n\n\u201cThe notion that this happened because Zion is in poor condition is just asinine,\u201d Griffin said, according to USA Today. \u201cHe wasn't in poor condition when he went 12 of 13 last week against Utah. That's not what it is. He's just a very unique body type and certainly from a physics perspective.\u201d\n\nThe 19-year-old was forced to be pulled from the Summer League after tweaking his knee and then left a preseason game against the Chicago Bulls early.\n\nVANVLEET SCORES CAREER-HIGH 34, RAPTORS TOP PELICANS 130-122\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the narrative out there about him and this happened because he\u2019s not in shape and he\u2019s too big,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThat dude is a freak of nature. When he went through his physical, he ran on the treadmill longer than the cardio-stress test people have ever needed to put anybody through a test to get his heart rate up. That happened because he\u2019s touched by the hand of God to do this. He\u2019s in elite condition. He stays in elite condition.\u201d\n\nThe No. 1 overall pick tore his right lateral meniscus and missed the final preseason game against the New York Knicks. He will be out for 6-8 weeks after having knee surgery, the team said this week.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe Pelicans were set to start Williamson alongside Lonzo Ball, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram and Derrick Favors.
