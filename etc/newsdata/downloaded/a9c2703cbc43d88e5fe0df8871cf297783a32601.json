It is the first time the federal government has calculated agency-specific requests for spending on artificial intelligence. AI spending for the Defense Department is classified.\n\nTrump administration officials said they believe the total reflects their commitment to maintaining and strengthening U.S. leadership in AI. They also suggested their figures are more transparent than China\u2019s AI investment numbers, which have prompted worry in the U.S.\n\n\u201cToo often, the conversation focuses almost exclusively not on where America is dominant, but instead on the alleged disparity in government spending on AI R&D,\u201d Michael Kratsios, the U.S. chief technology officer, said at a Washington panel event. \u201cIn American AI R&D budgets, you won\u2019t find aspirational expenditures or cryptic funding mechanisms.\u201d\n\nBut representatives from chip makers Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. , who were participating in the event, said the U.S. needed to invest even more in AI. They also criticized federal officials for not doing enough to come up with regulations governing data protection and privacy, which some experts argue could spur private investment in AI because the technology relies heavily on data.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near where we should be\u201d in government funding for AI research, said Jackie Medecki, director and managing attorney of Intel\u2019s U.S. AI and health-care policy division.\n\nShe called for federal privacy regulations clarifying how data could be used. Currently, various state laws govern data privacy. Ms. Medecki says that \u201cpatchwork\u201d of regulations makes it difficult to use AI. Having a national, comprehensive privacy law would create more trust in AI by creating guardrails around the use of people\u2019s data, she said. \u201cA big miss for the U.S. is the failure to have robust national privacy legislation,\u201d she said.\n\nThe White House plan calls for government agencies to develop ethical AI systems and shared public data sets for AI training, and seeks to improve how humans and machines interact, among many other initiatives.\n\nIn February, President Trump signed an executive order to focus on AI initiatives that included investing in research and development and setting AI governance standards. Various other countries have developed national strategies to promote the use and development of AI, including China, Finland, Canada, France and Germany. In 2017, Beijing announced plans to lead the world in AI by 2030.\n\nMs. Medecki said the U.S. government should follow the example of countries like Estonia, which developed a formal strategy for how the technology should be used, including AI\u2019s ethical implications.\n\nIntel this year released a set of recommendations for the U.S. government on AI. They included suggestions to mandate the adoption of AI systems throughout the government and to adopt federal privacy legislation.\n\n\u201cI think there is a real government role, and frankly a little bit of failure here\u2026to show examples of AI and how AI can help us,\u201d Ms. Medecki said.\n\nChina is adopting AI at a faster rate than the U.S. and the European Union, possibly because Chinese companies and citizens understand the value of AI, according to an August report released by the Center for Data Innovation, a nonpartisan research institute. Tuesday\u2019s event was held at the National Press Club and hosted by the Center for Data Innovation.\n\nThe U.S. government should do more to maintain the country\u2019s status as a leader in AI, said Anthony Robbins, Nvidia\u2019s vice president for the North American public sector. Washington needs to boost its AI training programs and figure out a way to compete for AI talent with startups and technology companies that pay more, he said.\n\n\u201cA billion dollars is certainly a great thing and certainly interesting, but it\u2019s not nearly enough,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014John D.
