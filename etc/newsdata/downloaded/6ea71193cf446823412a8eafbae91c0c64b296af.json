(Alison Masemann/CBC)\n\n\"He was saying goodbye to his dad, but he knew the nation was going to be watching,\" said DiMonte, a Montreal DJ who has known Trudeau since he was a teenager in the late 1980s.\n\n\"It's something I'll never forget,\" he told The Current .\n\nAt the time, Trudeau was a drama and English teacher in Vancouver, but the eulogy delivered at Notre Dame Basilica in Montreal prompted speculation among some that he was destined for politics . It wasn't universally admired, however. A National Post piece criticized it as being a \"treacly, over-acted embarrassment.\"\n\nJustin Trudeau speaks to mourners at his father's funeral in Montreal. 2:28\n\nWhen his brother, Michel, died in an avalanche in 1998, Trudeau became an advocate for safety measures \u2014 one of his earliest forays into public life.\n\nBut in his memoir, Common Ground, Trudeau writes that he caught the politics bug working on Gerard Kennedy's Liberal leadership campaign in 2006. He would become MP for Papineau, Que., in 2008, the leader of the Liberal party in 2013 , and prime minister in 2015 .\n\nDiMonte remembers that when he first met Trudeau, \"he wanted nothing to do with politics,\" over fears he couldn't live up to his father's political legacy.\n\n\"But as he got older and thought about it more ... he really became enthralled with public service,\" said DiMonte.\n\nThe Trudeau children in 1979: Michel, front left, Alexandre (Sacha), front right, and Justin, at the back.

He apologized,\" said Nestor, who runs a boxing gym in Papineau, Que.\n\nNestor has known Trudeau for nine years, ever since the then-MP started coming to his gym, rekindling a childhood interest in boxing. He trained Trudeau for his 2012 match against Sen. Patrick Brazeau .\n\nOn that phone call, he asked Trudeau for an explanation, and \"wanted to make sure that I had never been mistaken about him.\"\n\n\"He simply reassured me,\" Nestor said.\n\nAli Nestor at his boxing gym in Papineau, Que. He has known Trudeau for almost a decade. (Alison Masemann/CBC)\n\n\"And I told him plainly that he still has my friendship, and he still has my support.\"\n\nTrudeau made a public apology, but Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said that \"wearing brownface is an act of open mockery and racism.\"\n\n\"It was just as racist in 2001 as it is in 2019,\" he said.\n\nNestor argued that the release of the pictures was politically motivated, to \"create a scandal.\"\n\n\"This is a situation that does not involve the black community. It's a matter of white politicians seeking to use the cause of blacks to succeed,\" he said.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau pictured at Le coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf in the school talent show singing Day-O in blackface makeup. (CBC)\n\nA Christmas tradition\n\nAnalysts have argued that part of the challenge facing Trudeau in this election is convincing Canadians that's he's the leader he promised to be in 2015 \u2014 but DiMonte has no doubt that he is.\n\nAround the time of his father's death, Trudeau started to join the DJ for a Christmas edition of his CHOM-FM show in Montreal.\n\n\"He told stories about his father taking him to the North Pole, and Christmas morning on Sussex Drive,\" DiMonte said. \"He opened the curtain just a little bit about what it was like to be the son of the iconic Pierre Trudeau at Christmas.\"\n\nTrudeau during one of his guest appearances on Terry DiMonte's radio show, which happens every Christmas. (Submitted by Terry Dimonte )\n\nWhen Trudeau won the federal election in 2015, DiMonte assumed that was the end of the Christmas tradition. But in November that year, Trudeau sent a text asking when he should come in.\n\n\"I was like: 'Wait a minute, aren't you running the country?'\"\n\nDiMonte remembers that on the night before the show, Trudeau was in Vancouver, and his team said he would join the show by telephone.\n\nBut the next day, \"there was a text from Justin saying: 'Disregard that note, I'm coming in.'\"\n\nIn the fours years since, Trudeau and DiMonte have kept the tradition alive \u2014 and he expects it to continue this Christmas.\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran, with files from CBC News.
