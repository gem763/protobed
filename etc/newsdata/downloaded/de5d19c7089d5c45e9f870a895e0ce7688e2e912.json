The NES Zapper classic has lived on, homaged in games like Halo 5 and featured in the last two Super Smash Bros. games. Now, an anonymous hero has also brought the fun of Duck Hunt to Super Mario Maker 2.\n\nThe level, by user Kray0n, is simply called \u201cDuck Hunt\u201d (ID: 7Y1-X73-71G) and features an ingenious contraption that uses the red blocks and the accompanying on/off switch to form a crosshair for a shooting gallery of flying Koopas.\n\nHit the switch when a Koopa Paratroopa is in your \u201csights\u201d and the blocks will appear, taking out the Koopa. As soon as you hit the switch, the contraption \u201creloads,\u201d and the blocks disappear again.\n\nIt\u2019s a neat little Mario Maker machine, but it\u2019s also surprisingly fun to play given how simple it is. The delay between firing your \u201cgun\u201d and the blocks appearing is wide enough to make shooting Koopas a challenging rhythm game that isn\u2019t too frustrating, and once you\u2019ve got seven, the level ends. It took me about a minute, and I was delighted. All that was missing was the dog.", "description": "They say legends never die, so it makes sense that Duck Hunt seems immortal.
