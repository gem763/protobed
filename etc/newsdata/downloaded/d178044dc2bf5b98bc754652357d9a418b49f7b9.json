Sound familiar?\n\nSpy recruiter and agent runner Nat has returned to London and wife Prue, expecting to be put out to pasture after decades of patriotic service for British intelligence, with stints in Moscow, Budapest and Helsinki, among others. Instead of retirement, Nat is asked to run a local Russia-focused London substation named The Haven, staffed by a motley crew of low-level defectors and European recruits.\n\nWithin the confines of The Haven, Nat finds Florence who is herself running an agent and appears to be sitting on a gold mine of intelligence: back-channel funding and Ukrainian oligarchs, possibly leading to Moscow Centre, the heart of Russia\u2019s spy network. What Nat doesn\u2019t know at the time is that separate from his new assignment he has already met a key player in the drama about to unfold while playing badminton at his sports club. Ed, who at first glance is curious and shy, challenges Nat to a game of badminton and the two form a man\u2019s sports acquaintance over post-match drinks.\n\nThree lives collide as Nat tries to run an operation amid office intrigue, uncertain allegiances and the larger politics of 2018 Britain. Le Carre\u2019s Ed spews anti-Trump and anti-Brexit rhetoric, however, the author remains an idealist in the face of this new Cold War. He believes in the power of doing the right thing.\n\nLe Carre\u2019s Nat relies on his 25 years of experience as an agent runner to navigate the competing forces of money and power, patriotism and love. And with a style honed over 25 novels and more than 50 years, the author\u2019s prose is crisp and compelling and the story is relevant to today\u2019s turbulent times.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Agent Running in the Field: a Novel,\" Viking, by John le Carre", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jonathan Elderfield"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/book_review_-_agent_running_in_the_field_35661_c0-1703-3675-3846_s1200x700.jpg?10703b82efb318176f13ea2e82ff725444281b9c", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
