I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put makeup on,\u201d Trudeau said at a news conference Wednesday evening. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should have known better, but I didn\u2019t, and I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\n\nTrudeau also admitted to wearing blackface in high school while singing the song \u201cDay-O\u201d at a talent show.\n\nThe prime minister kicked off his reelection bid last week amid a political climate that has grown increasingly grim for the Liberal Party leader once considered an international darling. Trudeau faces a formidable challenge from Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, who blasted his opponent Wednesday night, calling the brownface photo \u201can act of open mockery and racism.\u201d\n\n[Trudeau launches Canada\u2019s election season dogged by scandal, Scheer]\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Scheer said he was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cdisappointed.\u201d\n\nThe Conservatives, who are in a dead heat with the Liberals, have accused Trudeau of being \u201cnot as advertised.\u201d\n\nTrudeau, who said in his apology Wednesday that he has \u201cworked all [his] life to try and create opportunities for people to fight against racism and intolerance,\u201d has positioned himself as a champion of diversity and inclusiveness. He earned international acclaim in 2015 when, as the new prime minister, he unveiled \u201ca cabinet that looks like Canada,\u201d as he put it then. He has boasted about having more Sikhs in his cabinet than Prime Minister Narendra Modi does in India.\n\n[Canadian PM Justin Trudeau apologizes for wearing \u2018brownface\u2019 after photo emerges]\n\nSpeaking from a campaign plane in Halifax, Trudeau said that he now recognizes brownface as \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nHe added that he spent the evening calling friends and colleagues and has \u201cmany more calls to make.\u201d\n\nExclusive: Justin Trudeau wore brownface at 2001 \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 party while he taught at a private school, Canada's Liberal Party admits https://t.co/j3UobfYNIF \u2014 TIME (@TIME) September 18, 2019\n\nThe story landed like a bomb one week into a campaign that has seen the Liberals digging up and releasing old social media posts and videos from Conservative candidates that they say show that the party is welcoming to those who hold insensitive and intolerant views.\n\nThe National Council of Canadian Muslims thanked Trudeau on Wednesday evening for his swift apology, after tweeting a statement from executive director Mustafa Farooq calling the prime minister\u2019s use of brownface \u201cdeeply saddening.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wearing of blackface/brownface is reprehensible, and hearkens back to a history of racism and an Orientalist mythology which is unacceptable,\u201d Farooq\u2019s statement read.\n\nUPDATE: We thank the Prime Minister for his apology.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Trudeau's apology came less than an hour after NCCM called on him to apologize for wearing blackface/brownface.\n\n\n\nPromises made, promises kept. That's the NCCM way. \u2014 NCCM (@nccm) September 19, 2019\n\nJagmeet Singh, a turban-wearing Sikh who leads Canada\u2019s left-leaning New Democratic Party, called the photograph \u201ctroubling\u201d and \u201cinsulting.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference in Mississauga, Ontario, he spoke directly to those who have experienced racism and \u201cmight feel like giving up on Canada.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to know that you have value, you have worth and you are loved,\u201d he said, his voice breaking.\n\nGreen Party leader Elizabeth May also shared her dismay.\n\n\u201cI am deeply shocked by the racism shown in the photograph of Justin Trudeau,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cHe must apologize for the harm done and commit to learning and appreciating the requirement to model social justice leadership at all levels of government. In this matter he has failed.\u201d\n\nTrudeau has been panned before for his attire choices, something he alluded to Wednesday, saying he has \u201cbeen more enthusiastic about costumes than is sometimes appropriate.\u201d Last February, he faced scrutiny for wearing embroidered kurtas and sherwanis \u2014 traditional Indian garb \u2014 during a diplomatically awkward trip to India. In response to criticism over his many costume changes on that sojourn, he told reporters: \u201cI have long been known to wear traditional clothes to a broad range of events in many different communities in Canada and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nTrudeau is also battling a furor over ethics violations after the country\u2019s then-attorney general accused government officials of pressuring her into reaching an out-of-court settlement with an engineering firm from Trudeau\u2019s home province that was charged with bribery and corruption.\n\nIn nationally televised parliamentary hearings, the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, said she received \u201cveiled threats\u201d and was demoted when she refused to succumb to the pressure.\n\nThe allegations set off a political firestorm and triggered several high-profile resignations, including that of Wilson-Raybould, who was then expelled from the Liberal Party. Trudeau \u2014 who pitched Canadians on running a transparent government that would be open to diverse views \u2014 stood accused of shady backroom dealings and judicial interference, of being a fake feminist, and of bullying Wilson-Raybould, an indigenous woman.\n\nSouth of the 49th parallel, white American politicians have a lengthy history of racist pantomime. U.S. lawmakers from both parties have faced scrutiny and scorn for wearing blackface \u2014 a caricature of black people inspired by minstrel shows dating to the 1830s.\n\nMost recently, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) apologized last month for wearing \u201csome black paint all over her face\u201d during a college skit in 1967. And earlier this year, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) admitted to wearing blackface to impersonate Michael Jackson.\n\nThe Northam incident began a national outcry that shed new light on the racist past of Northam and the scores of other politicians who for years have emerged from similar scandals relatively unscathed.", "description": "The photograph, taken while Trudeau was a teacher at the private West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver, shows the prime minister smiling with a darkened face while wearing a feathered turban.", "authors": ["Amanda Coletta", "Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MW-OUnpp5dECMvt-g3ct80IfvOM=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/5d82cfd946e0fb0009be69ef/5c2962ad2e8076524a9d42581b8e0eff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
