Steven Soderbergh suspects that is what he likes about film-making: the chance to play the role of a criminal mastermind, assembling a gang of diverse talents for a high-stakes adventure. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes not \u2013 it\u2019s all part of the thrill. \u201cThe life not lived,\u201d he says with a grin.\n\nSoderbergh has made films about dashing, lawless outsiders: bank-robbing George Clooney in Out of Sight; the rackety brothers in Logan Lucky; the whole star-spangled crew from the Oceans franchise. His latest picture tackles a different breed of crime \u2013 one that is industrialised, anonymous and altogether less romantic. Inspired by the 2016 release of the Panama Papers, The Laundromat lifts the lid on a culture of tax evasion and financial skulduggery, bent accountants and shadowy lawyers. Soderbergh prefers underdogs; white-collar crooks make him sick. But it may be that he is swimming in the same dirty water.\n\nThe Laundromat review: Gary Oldman spins lies to Meryl Streep in sparkling comedy Read more\n\nSeated by the window in his Venice hotel, the director holds court with the easy authority of a seasoned campaigner. Soderbergh has shot scores of movies and met hundreds of reporters. The interview junket is bread-and-butter to him. So he says that he chose to frame The Laundromat as a black comedy because that was the best way to get the information across. And he explains why he installed the disgraced lawyers J\u00fcrgen Mossack and Ram\u00f3n Fonseca as the film\u2019s Greek chorus, plundering their own words in order to power the script.\n\n\u201cThey are not portrayed doing anything in the film that they didn\u2019t do in real life,\u201d he points out. \u201cI mean, if I had one of them grabbing a woman\u2019s handbag on the street, they could say, \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t do that.\u2019 Whereas they have, essentially, been grabbing women\u2019s handbags in a global sense, on every street.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Meryl Streep in The Laundromat.

The Laundromat uncoils as a barbed and stinging burlesque, a film that schools us in the intricacies of shell companies and \u201cthe secret life of money\u201d. It casts Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas as the twinkling Mossack and Fonseca; Meryl Streep as the innocent pensioner who represents all their victims. But Soderbergh\u2019s crime scene is so vast that it risks spilling over the sides. One of the revelations of the Panama Papers was that Pedro Almod\u00f3var, Banderas\u2019s old friend, was briefly a client of Mossack-Fonseca.\n\nAt one stage, intriguingly, The Laundromat veers even closer to home. On-screen, Oldman\u2019s anti-hero outlines a scheme involving 26,000 tax-exempt companies registered in the US state of Delaware. \u201cThe director of this movie has five,\u201d he adds.\n\nSoderbergh has five companies in Delaware? The director shrugs. \u201cI have six now,\u201d he says.\n\nWell done, I say. Congratulations.\n\n\u201cWell no,\u201d he says. \u201cNot congratulations. But when I make a film like Logan Lucky, I form an LLC [Limited Liability Company]. It generates no revenue. It\u2019s essentially an entity that can enter into contracts and get insurance cover for the movie. It\u2019s open when we start production and as soon as I make delivery, it\u2019s defunct. For someone like me, whose intention is to make a product and sell that product, it\u2019s perfect \u2013 a very helpful tool.\u201d Another shrug. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s open to misuse. A hammer is a great tool for a nail. But you can also use it to beat someone\u2019s head in.\u201d\n\nFair enough, it\u2019s how the business works. But might this qualify as a kind of soft corruption? The film industry is reliant on tax breaks and sweeteners. But its management arguably shades into the voodoo accounting that was Mossack-Fonseca\u2019s specialty. Soderbergh has always been ambivalent about Hollywood. I wonder if he views it as outright crooked, too.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Laundromat is a black comedy about white collar crime.\n\nThe director sits up. \u201cOh no, it\u2019s not,\u201d he insists. \u201cGiven its scale, it\u2019s about the most transparent industry going. Do you know why? It\u2019s because it\u2019s completely unionised. The studios and independent producers have to report everything they are doing. And unlike other businesses, where people are just making money off the making of money, Hollywood\u2019s assets are real. You can\u2019t fake if the product worked or it didn\u2019t. It either made $100m or it made $100.\u201d\n\nHe points out that he spent nine years as vice president of the Directors\u2019 Guild. He went in a sceptic and came out converted. \u201cI grew up with a default mode of being embarrassed by being in the entertainment industry. Not any more. These days I think, fuck, I wish more large-scale enterprises worked like this.\u201d\n\nOr to put it another way, the Hollywood interloper has become the insider. Undeniably Soderbergh landed with an almighty splash. He was 26 when his debut picture, sex, lies and videotape, won the Palme d\u2019Or in 1989, prompting the critic Roger Ebert to dub him \u201cthe poster boy of independent cinema\u201d. But the 90s were a bust. Soderbergh was flailing, experimenting, sometimes falling flat on his face. \u201cI made five films that tanked,\u201d he admits. \u201cAnd then Out of Sight saved my ass.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m glad he brings up Out of Sight. The 1998 thriller remains a joyous tour-de-force. He says it\u2019s the one film he has made that he has no desire to change, but his golden comeback almost didn\u2019t happen at all. He was nobody\u2019s first choice to direct. So he had to sit on the sidelines until everyone else turned it down. \u201cThen when I did get the job, it was the most anxious I\u2019ve been. I had to do a Jedi mind-trick on myself just to step out on set. I knew that if I fucked this one up then it was all over, I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gary Oldman, left, and Antonio Banderas as Mossack and Fonseca, whose law firm was at the centre of the Panama Papers scandal. Photograph: Claudette Barius/Netflix\n\nFrom time to time, it appears, the man still suspects that he is done. Film-making is exhausting; he would like to try other things. In 2013 he even announced his retirement. He cleared the decks and began to train as a painter. Then the script for the Cinemax television drama The Knick landed on his doormat and, hey presto, all at once he was right back on the scene.\n\n\u201cYeah, but I had legitimately stepped away,\u201d he insists. \u201cNothing in development. Tabula rasa. I was working with this painter in New York, doing portraits, and I was three months into the process of re-orienting myself when the script for The Knick showed up. I thought, \u2018Let\u2019s get real for a second. Who the fuck is waiting for my paintings?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe issue, he feels, was that he had lost sight of what was really important. \u201cThen, sitting back on the set, I realised yes, this is where I belong. I\u2019d conflated my frustration with the movie business with the actual job of directing. I\u2019d confused the two, which was stupid of me. I hate the business. But I love the job.\u201d\n\nIt must be embarrassing, though \u2013 dropping the mic with a flourish only to hurry back on the stage. Soderbergh snorts. He supposes it was. \u201cBut OK,\u201d he says. \u201cI promise you now that if I ever retire again, I\u2019m going to ensure that I can\u2019t walk it back. I\u2019ll post a series of the most disgusting, offensive, outrageous statements you can ever imagine. That way it will be impossible for me to ever be employed again. No one is going to take my calls. No one is going to want to be seen with me.\u201d\n\nBy this point he\u2019s laughing but I think he might mean it. \u201cOh, it will be scorched earth,\u201d he vows. \u201cI will have torched everything. I\u2019m going to flame out in the most legendary fashion.\u201d\n\nThe Laundromat is on Netflix from 18 October", "description": "Steven Soderbergh\u2019s latest film is about dodgy dealings in the financial world but in film-making corruption is not endemic, he says, because everyone is accountable", "authors": ["Xan Brooks"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7bbac408d03788e7301a9578155ca99e26940a2/349_0_2602_1562/master/2602.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=101f58f6d51e0b68af6517ef7f8fd3a6", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
