And he encouraged U.S. and Ukrainian prosecutors to discuss investigating a gas company linked to the son of Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nBut Zelenskiy insisted he's not Trump's puppet and his moves appeared to be an attempt to put an end to questions dogging the Ukrainian president since details of his July 25 call with Trump emerged. He said U.S. officials have presented zero evidence of Ukraine's interference in 2016, but it's in his country's interests to find out once and for all what happened.\n\nIn an all-day \"media marathon\" held in a Kyiv food court, Ukraine's president played down suggestions that Trump pressured him in exchange for U.S. military aid to help Ukraine battle Russian-backed separatists. Congressional Democrats believe Trump was holding up the aid to use as leverage to pressure Ukraine and advance his domestic political interests.\n\nResponding to questions from The Associated Press, Zelenskiy said he only learned after their phone call that the U.S. had blocked hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"There was no blackmail,\" he said.\n\n\"We are not servants. We are an independent country.\"\n\nZelenskiy invited U.S. and Ukrainian prosecutors to cooperate on an eventual investigation into the Bidens, but insisted he would not interfere.\n\n\"I don't want to be pulled into this because I understand that my words could impact the elections of the American people,\" he said.\n\nTrump has said the United States has an \"absolute right\" to ask foreign leaders to investigate corruption cases, though no one has produced evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the former U.S. vice president or his son.\n\nTrump also has pushed a long-discredited theory about Ukrainian interference in support of the Democrats in 2016, an attempt to cast doubt on Russia's role in the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee. The theory contends, without evidence, that the DNC hack was based on fabricated computer records and designed to cast blame on Russia but was initiated from Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy said Thursday that Ukraine would investigate the theory because otherwise we \"can't say yes or no\" as to whether there was any such interference.\n\nDuring his July 25 call with Zelenskiy, Trump mentioned CrowdStrike, a security firm hired by the DNC that detected the hack. CrowdStrike has also worked for the Republicans. Trump has claimed the company was based in Ukraine, but it is based in the U.S. and company co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Russian-born U.S. citizen.\n\nThe July call is central to the impeachment inquiry, and embarrassed Zelenskiy because it showed him as eager to please Trump and critical of European partners whose support he needs to strengthen Ukraine's economy and to end the conflict with Russia.\n\nZelenskiy said it was \"wrong\" of the White House to publish a rough transcript of the call \u2014 and said he will not publish the Ukrainian transcript. He said he \"didn't even check\" whether the Ukrainian transcript of the July call is the same as that of the White House, but says \"I think they match.\"\n\nZelenskiy appears to be playing to both U.S. political camps to ensure Ukraine has continued support no matter who wins the presidential election next year.\n\nZelenskiy said he thought the call would lead to an in-person meeting with Trump, and wanted the American leader to come to Ukraine. Zelenskiy said the \"key question\" for him was to try to persuade the White House to \"change its rhetoric\" about Ukraine as a corrupt and untrustworthy country.\n\nTrump said the military aid was frozen because of concerns about corruption in Ukraine, but the move prompted congressional outcry and the money was released in September.\n\nAsked what Ukraine did to persuade the U.S. to release the aid, Zelenskiy said: \"We have many diplomatic contacts. And in case we need to find a solution to questions of this level, questions about our country's security, we use all our powerful possibilities.\" He didn't elaborate.", "description": "Ukraine's president insisted Thursday that he faced \"no blackmail\" from President Donald Trump in their phone call that helped spark an impeachment inquiry, distancing himself from the U.S. political drama and trying to claw back his own credibility.
