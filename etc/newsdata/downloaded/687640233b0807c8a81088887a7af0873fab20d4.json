Yes we are topless, but it's the female form and it's beautiful and it is to be celebrated.\n\n\"We are powerful and we are strong and we all feel very strong when we perform,\" she added.\n\n\"It's about confidence. We all really take care of ourselves and I'm very much into yoga, body confidence and feeling good in yourself,\" added the dancer.\n\nThe Lido has thrown open its doors for a limited period so the public can join its boot camp.\n\nVictoria also shares her eating and well-being tips -- eggs on toast for breakfast washed down with a spinach, cucumber, celery and apple smoothie and lots of thankfulness.\n\nHer secret, she says, to surviving 12 shows a week is yoga, which along with pilates and \"body pump\", is the backbone of the boot camp courses the Lido is offering to the public.\n\nThe men and women taking part also get a chance to participate in an extract from the Lido's current show, \"Paris Merveilles\" (Paris Marvels).\n\n- 'I never hesitated' -\n\n\"To me, regardless of where we are dancing, a career in dance is what we all trained for and it's what we all want,\" Victoria said.\n\nThe 33-year-old said she had never had a second thought about becoming a chorus girl, with some of her teachers also pointing her that way from an early age.\n\n\"I only ever saw cabaret and the showgirl world as something glamorous and beautiful and something to be celebrated,\" she said.\n\n\"So I never hesitated for a second.\"\n\nThe troupe was founded in 1932 by the Irish dancer and choreographer, Margaret Kelly, when she was only 22.\n\nHer heroics during the German Occupation, when she hid her Jewish husband, a stateless pianist and composer who worked at the Folies Bergere, inspired Francois Truffaut's film, \"The Last Metro\", and the BBC drama series, \"Bluebell\".\n\nWhile the Lido claims that it \"loves diversity in body and character\", its long-legged dancers have to be at least 1.75 metres (five foot seven inches) to make the cut as a Bluebell girl.\n\nBut the women taking part in the cabaret's boot camp do come in all shapes, sizes and colours.\n\nFor several, the classes were not just about upping their fitness but also about being able to walk \"this mythic stage\".\n\n\"It's now or never,\" one joked to AFP.", "description": "How can Paris cabarets, with their near-identical lines of statuesque, scantily-clad showgirls and cancan dancers, adapt in the age of #MeToo?
