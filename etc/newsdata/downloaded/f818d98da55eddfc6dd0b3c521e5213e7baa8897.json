In a tweet to his 73,000 followers, Drew Scanlon stepped forward as \u201cBlinking White Guy\u201d to make his plea.\n\n\u201cHi Internet! I\u2019m Drew and THIS IS MY FACE,\u201d he wrote on Sept. 19. \u201cIf this GIF has ever brought you joy in the past, I humbly ask you to consider making a donation to the National MS Society. It would mean a lot to me and to those I know affected by the disease!\u201d\n\n'DIEHARD' TANNER LEFT WITH HOLE IN FACE AFTER SKIN CANCER DIAGNOSIS\n\nHe then included a link to his fundraising page on the Bike MS: Waves to Wine 2019 website. In a follow-up tweet posted Sept. 21, Scanlon used his own GIF to express his astonishment at the success of his campaign.\n\n\u201cFolks, we have raised over TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS so far!! Thank you SO much to everyone who has contributed, this is truly astounding! Pictured: live footage of my astonishment,\u201d he said, alongside the infamous GIF.\n\nMINNESOTA MAN CONTRACTS RARE FUNGAL INFECTION THAT KILLED HIS DOG LAST YEAR\n\nOn his fundraising page, Scanlon said he has two close friends who were diagnosed with MS, as well as some of their family members. MS is an unpredictable, often disabling disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain, and between the brain and body, according to the National MS Society. The cause is unknown, and the progress, severity and symptoms vary from person to person. Symptoms can also fluctuate or change over time.\n\nSome of the more common symptoms may include fatigue, walking difficulties, numbness or tingling, spasticity, weakness, vision problems, dizziness and vertigo, bladder problems, sexual problems, bowel problems, pain and itching, cognitive changes, emotional changes and depression. Less common symptoms may present as speech problems, trouble swallowing, tremor, seizures, breathing issues and hearing loss.\n\nThere is no known cure for MS, but treatments can help modify or slow progress of the disease, and manage relapses. Scanlon touched on this on his fundraising page and said that\u2019s why he decided to partake in Bike MS. From Sept. 21-22, he cycled over 120 miles from San Francisco to wine country as part of the fundraiser.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIf a fraction of those who have seen my goofy face donated to MS research, I have a feeling we could kick this thing in no time!\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhile the cycling part of the fundraiser has ended, Scanlon noted his page is accepting donations until November.\n\nMany Twitter users were quick to thank him for drawing attention to the cause and put their own spin on his GIF.", "description": "His viral fame helped raise over $25,000 for MS.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/twitter_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
