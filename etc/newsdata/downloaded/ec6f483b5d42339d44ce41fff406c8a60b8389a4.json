(Tom Fox/Pool via Reuters)\n\nA brutal world needs Christian mercy and the joyful rigor of the examined life.\n\nI\u2019ve been overwhelmed lately with this \u201ccancel culture\u201d business. If someone discovers you\u2019ve looked the wrong way once in your life, it\u2019s all over. People set out to destroy you. That\u2019s not the way we are meant to live. We\u2019ve all looked the wrong way. We\u2019ve all made mistakes. We\u2019ve all sinned. And we all will again. One of the great glories of life is that we can begin again. Our sorrow for our sins and awareness of our weaknesses keeps helping us get better and be better on this journey of life with all its challenges. But increasingly we forget this. More and more, it seems, the loudest voices in culture won\u2019t make room for growth and redemption. And so people despair \u2014 they think they are stuck. And things on the news don\u2019t help, as we\u2019re all sucked into more terrible news and anger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut did you notice the breath of fresh air recently? It was the day of the sentencing of that former Dallas police officer, Amber Guyger, who killed a man, Botham Jean, thinking he had invaded her apartment when she was actually in his apartment. I hope you\u2019ve heard by now his young brother\u2019s testimony of forgiveness. Brandt Jean said to Guyger, for all the world to see, because there were cameras in the courtroom: \u201cI love you just like anyone else. . . . I personally want the best for you. . . . I don\u2019t even want you to go to jail. I want the best for you, because I know that\u2019s exactly what Botham would want.\u201d He went on to encourage her to give her life to Christ.\n\nAnd then, as you may have seen, he hugged her. That was the love of God he displayed, and he was able to do so because he\u2019s clearly encountered it in his own life. So many people today don\u2019t truly appreciate the role of the Creator in their lives, that he loves us into existence. And you don\u2019t have to believe in God to have some awe and gratitude about so much that exists, including the incredibly complex and wonderful human person!\n\nAnd then the judge! She went and got one of her Bibles to give the woman she was sentencing to ten years in prison.\n\nThis message of forgiveness and the invitation to give your life to Christ is powerful. And you don\u2019t have to be Christian to appreciate it. We need this kind of radical love and forgiveness in our culture and in our lives.\n\nOne of my favorite writings of Pope Paul VI, who was on the scene at the heart of the tumult of the sexual revolution, is about proclaiming Christ in the world. It\u2019s a sermon in which he said:\n\nHe is like us but more perfectly human, simple, poor, humble, and yet, while burdened with work, he is more patient. He spoke on our behalf; he worked miracles; and he founded a new kingdom: in it the poor are happy; peace is the foundation of a life in common; where the pure of heart and those who mourn are uplifted and comforted; the hungry find justice; sinners are forgiven; and all discover that they are brothers.\n\nYou hear so much of the love story that is Christianity in that, and for all humanity. What Brandt Jean showed us is why we need to embrace this as an essential element of our culture. It makes for people who are leaven. It makes us more tender. There\u2019s too much brutality. And here, even in the face of it, there is love!\n\nThe other cultural-breather moment came around the same time, but in much lighter circumstances. It was on late-night television. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert was interviewing Patricia Heaton about her new comedy show, Carol\u2019s Second Act. They had bonded during an earlier interview, about their shared Catholic faith. They had a lot of fun with it last time, and this time the conversation turned much more reflective. With joy radiating from her, Heaton talked about getting older and taking stock. She talked about having given up drinking, having come to realize it was a little too much. And that it wasn\u2019t necessary to have in her life. She thanked the audience for applauding that news, explaining that some of her friends were disappointed, thinking she wouldn\u2019t be as much fun. We do do that to people \u2014 make them feel uncomfortable for the kind of serious examination of habits and motives that is the healthiest way to live life. Heaton had a real love about her in that interview \u2014 as she frequently does in her own social-media presence and in her talent for making people laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey say that God writes straight with crooked lines, that He works in mysterious ways. How many of us know that to be true? And, goodness, did I see that truth the night I happened upon Brandt Jean\u2019s witness, and Heaton\u2019s, too. These came as a pair, no doubt, as a reminder: Love is for the unthinkable times and for the everyday. There are constant opportunities to strip ourselves of the world. This is what both of these people were doing and sharing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe need more reflection and self-awareness and mercy in the world. People feel as if they are drowning in small and in monumental ways. We\u2019re in this together. Lend a hand to help life someone above water, even if for a moment. It may make all the difference. After seeing Jean and watching Heaton, I woke up one morning, thinking, Can we give one another a break already? Can we encourage one another while it is still today?\n\nThanks be to God for cultural moments that help up see and be light when there is so much darkness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis column is based on one available through Andrews McMeel Universal\u2019s Newspaper Enterprise Association.", "description": "A brutal world needs Christian mercy and the joyful rigor of the examined life.", "authors": ["Kathryn J.
