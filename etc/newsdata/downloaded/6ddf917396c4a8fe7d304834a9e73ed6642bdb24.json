Sheppard, who lead the team of astronomers that made the discovery.\n\nSimilar to their discovery of a dozen moons orbiting Jupiter last year, the team will now host a public contest designed to name the newest additions to Saturn's bevy of moons.\n\nParticipants are being welcomed to submit names having to do with either Norse or Gallic mythology via Carnegie's online form.\n\nResearchers noted that the formation of the retrograde moons indicates that they were likely once apart of a larger moon that was fractured.\n\n'This kind of grouping of outer moons is also seen around Jupiter, indicating violent collisions occurred between moons in the Saturnian system or with outside objects such as passing asteroids or comets,' said Sheppard.\n\nTwo of the moon's discovered orbiting the planet (pictured above) are prograde -- meaning the spin in the same direction as Saturn on its axis -- and take two years to travel around the planet\n\nAdditionally, researchers say the moons were likely created after the planet was mostly formed given their proximity.\n\n'In the Solar System\u2019s youth, the Sun was surrounded by a rotating disk of gas and dust from which the planets were born. It is believed that a similar gas-and-dust disk surrounded Saturn during its formation,' Sheppard said.\n\n'The fact that these newly discovered moons were able to continue orbiting Saturn after their parent moons broke apart indicates that these collisions occurred after the planet formation process was mostly complete and the disks were no longer a factor.'", "description": "Astronomers from International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center spotted 20 previously unknown moons, putting the planet's total to 82 -- three more over Jupiter's total of 79.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/22/19414154-0-image-a-8_1570484191046.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
