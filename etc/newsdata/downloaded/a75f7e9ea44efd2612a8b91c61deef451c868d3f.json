Unsurprisingly, the thought of having an always-connected camera and microphone that\u2019s linked to Facebook gave many people pause, including me.\n\nDespite those pervasive reservations \u2014 and undisclosed sales figures \u2014 Facebook is back with a new range of Portal devices for this year. A redesigned 10-inch model is joined by a new 8-inch version and a Portal camera that clips on top of your TV to use the biggest screen in your home for video calling. The 15-inch Portal Plus is unchanged and remains in the lineup as well.\n\nAside from the new design, the new $179.99 10-inch Portal has a lower price than last year\u2019s model and comes with a few new software features that were missing the first time around. It\u2019s available to order from Facebook and other retailers starting today. But if the reason you didn\u2019t want a Portal in your home was because it\u2019s a dedicated Facebook calling machine, then you\u2019re not going to want this one either.\n\nOur review of Facebook Portal 10-inch (2019) Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Sleeker design that fits in more places\n\nLower price\n\nBetter Alexa integration\n\nCan now make WhatsApp calls Bad Stuff Limited video streaming services\n\nPoor sound quality for music\n\nStill primarily a video calling device; all other features are afterthoughts\n\nYou have to use Facebook to make use of a Portal Buy for $129.00 from Facebook\n\nThe most obvious change with this year\u2019s Portal is its new design. The mini-TV look of the original has been replaced with something that looks more like a picture frame. It\u2019s still obviously a screen, but it can blend in better with your home\u2019s decor, and it has a smaller footprint while maintaining the same size screen.\n\nThe display is a 10-inch, 1280 x 800 pixel touchscreen, which seems like a low resolution, but it\u2019s perfectly fine for the distances from which you\u2019ll be using the Portal. It\u2019s bright and colorful, with good viewing angles, and it has a Night Mode that cuts down on blue light in the evening, much like your phone\u2019s night mode. It also has automatic brightness, but it doesn\u2019t have the same kind of impressive color balancing you\u2019ll find in Google\u2019s Nest Hub smart displays.\n\nCleverly, the Portal can be rotated to either landscape or portrait orientations, thanks to the kickstand on the back that also provides some cable management for the power cord. You can switch orientations at any time, including in the middle of a call, and the software will rotate and adapt to fit the screen properly. It\u2019s not quite as fancy as the larger Portal Plus\u2019 rotating screen, but it takes up far less space and doesn\u2019t look like a McDonald\u2019s kiosk sitting on your counter.\n\nFacebook also redesigned the speakers in the Portal with a 2.1 system using a rear-firing woofer and stereo front speakers that emit sound through the gap between the screen and the frame. The speakers sound fine for voice calls, but they\u2019re disappointing for music, which has an echoey, hollow sound. It\u2019s clear Facebook tuned these speakers for voices at the expense of music, and they don\u2019t compare to the sound from Amazon\u2019s 10-inch Echo Show.\n\nThe most important new hardware detail is the three-position sliding switch on the top of the Portal that lets you block the camera and mute the always-listening microphone. You can opt to block just the camera, which gets hidden behind a physical shutter, or both the mic and the camera for the full privacy treatment. It\u2019s a much better solution than the little plastic camera cap the original Portal had, which felt like an afterthought.\n\nI called the original Portal the best smart display for making video calls, so it\u2019s no surprise that the new model is just as competent in that front. All of the features from last year, including the wide-angle camera that automatically frames subjects, the beam-forming microphones that home in on a speaker\u2019s voice, and the integrations with Spotify and storybooks carry over here. Facebook has also expanded the AR masks to support multiple faces simultaneously and even change voices depending on the mask used. There are also new AR-based games you can play between two Portal devices.\n\nCalls made through the Portal have clear video and audio and don\u2019t require me to raise my voice unnaturally. The automatic framing feature, which Google has also adopted for video calls on its Nest Hub Max, makes it easy to casually make a call without having to stay in a rigid spot the entire time. I still don\u2019t think that Portal calls feel the same as an in-person interaction, as Facebook would like you to believe, but they are still better than video calls on the smart displays from Amazon or Google.\n\nUnfortunately, the Story Time mode, which lets you narrate stories with AR effects, is still limited to Portal devices and isn\u2019t very practical for parents who are traveling and want to call home to read a story to their children. I\u2019d have loved to see Facebook add the ability to host a Story Time session from a phone or tablet using the Facebook Messenger app.\n\nThe new Portal can now make WhatsApp calls in addition to Facebook Messenger\n\nThe big new addition to calling is the ability to place WhatsApp calls in addition to Facebook Messenger. You can link your WhatsApp account to the Portal just like you can with a laptop or desktop and then make end-to-end encrypted calls from the device. (Facebook says end-to-end encryption is coming to Messenger calls next year.) WhatsApp calls don\u2019t support all of the same features as Messenger, such as the AR masks and games, but they provide largely the same experience, which should make the Portal much more useful in places where WhatsApp is the dominant messaging platform.\n\nAgree to Continue: Facebook Portal Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. In order to use the Facebook Portal, you must have a Facebook account and agree to Facebook\u2019s terms and conditions and data policy. In addition, the Portal has a supplemental terms and conditions and data policy of its own that you must agree to in order to use the product. While setting up the Portal, you also are presented with the option to store voice interactions for the \u201cHey Portal\u201d commands. Linking Amazon Alexa, Spotify, and Pandora accounts with the Portal requires providing Facebook with access to those accounts and services. Final tally: four mandatory agreements and up to four more optional agreements, depending on how many services are linked to the device.\n\nAside from video calling, Facebook has expanded the Portal\u2019s capabilities on other fronts. (The company says the software updates and improvements will be delivered to all Portal units once the new model is available for purchase.) It\u2019s now using Amazon\u2019s smart display SDK for Alexa, so it provides the same kinds of screens and information from Alexa voice requests as Amazon\u2019s own Echo Show devices. I can view a summary of weather, recent sports scores, or my Alexa shopping list right on the Portal\u2019s display. I can even call up video feeds from security cameras and doorbells that support Alexa integration, such as Ring products.\n\nThe Portal now has a full web browser, which you can access from the grid of app shortcuts on one of the home screens. It\u2019s a bit clumsy to use, and it\u2019s not something I\u2019d even use every day. But for pulling up a website in a pinch, it gets the job done. It also supports YouTube and other video streaming sites, but unfortunately, Netflix doesn\u2019t work.\n\nVideo streaming services are still very limited on the Portal, though Facebook says that Amazon\u2019s Prime Video will be coming later this year. Still, video services are largely limited to Facebook\u2019s own Watch platform, and you can\u2019t use the Portal for watching Netflix, Hulu, HBO, or most any other streaming video service you might want. And you can\u2019t \u201ccast\u201d video from your smartphone or tablet to the Portal, like you can with Google\u2019s smart displays. A web browser doesn\u2019t really make up for this lack of options, either.\n\nStreaming music is a little easier since you can use Alexa to request songs and there are dedicated Spotify, iHeartRadio, and Pandora apps on the Portal. You can also use Spotify Connect to play music to the Portal from your phone. But as I noted earlier, the sound quality for music isn\u2019t great, and it\u2019s not something I\u2019d recommend if you want to listen to a lot of music with it.\n\nFacebook has also added the ability to send images from your phone to the Portal through a new mobile app, so you can use it as a digital photo frame. It also still can show slideshows of images from your Facebook or Instagram accounts. But compared to the Nest Hub\u2019s Google Photos integration, the Portal\u2019s photo features are far more limited.\n\nOverall, although the new Portal has a much-improved design, costs less, and fits into more places in my home than the prior model, it\u2019s still a Portal and it still has many of the same limitations as before. Unlike other smart displays, which act as information centers, smart home controllers, and video streamers in addition to making video calls, the Portal is primarily a video calling device that\u2019s limited to Facebook\u2019s services. And it\u2019s still a camera connected to Facebook inside your home.\n\nPhotography by Dan Seifert / The Verge", "description": "Facebook\u2019s new Portal video calling device has a sleeker design, and it can also make WhatsApp calls in addition to Facebook Messenger now.
