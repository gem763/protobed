And she knew that whatever it was, it had to be epic.\n\n\u201cI knew I wanted to do a really cool costume and something that was mommy and me,\u201d she told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nCummings, who is a traveling nurse based in Las Vegas and mother to Nathan Houston Burch, a rambunctious 2-year-old, wanted to make sure that the costume she chose would reflect his big personality.\n\nAfter giving it some thought, Cummings looked at some of her past posts about her son that she shared to her Facebook and Instagram accounts, which are devoted to funny posts about her son.\n\n\u201cThe whole joke is that he always has a snack and he is a very good eater,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had an issue with him eating anything.\u201d\n\nWith thoughts about her son\u2019s playful personality and his love for food, she came up with the idea to transform her son into the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich for Halloween -- a costume (and sandwich) as one-of-a-kind as him.\n\n\u201cI just went with it,\u201d she said about the outfit, inspired by the famed chicken sandwich which sold out just two weeks after its debut.\n\nCourtesy Nidra Cummings\n\nCourtesy Nidra Cummings\n\nCummings got to work on her son\u2019s costume around the time of his birthday and it took her about a month to create the costume out of two actual Popeyes boxes, with felt fabric from the local craft store for the sandwich elements.\n\nBut her secret ingredient to achieve that fried chicken look? Corn flakes, which she glued on the sleeves of a shirt from Target to give it that fried texture.\n\nCourtesy Nidra Cummings\n\n\u201cIt was very simple to make but I knew it was going to have a big impact,\u201d she said.\n\nFor her costume, Cummings transformed into Popeye\u2019s famous spokeswoman, Annie, and made her outfit by simply taking an apron and pasting the Popeyes logo across the front.\n\nCummings knew she wanted to share photos of her and her son in the costumes the week of Halloween, but it was fate when Popeyes announced Monday in an epic post that they would be bringing back the chicken sandwich.\n\nSo she posted the photos the following day and tagged Popeyes.\n\nSince sharing on social media, her posts have been shared more than 200 times and have received hundreds of likes.", "description": "Nidra Cummings, mother of 2-year-old Nathan Houston Burch, dressed her son up as the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich for Halloween.
