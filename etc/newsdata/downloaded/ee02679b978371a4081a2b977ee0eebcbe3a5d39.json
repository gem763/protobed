(Screenshot)\n\nThe National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) is filing a second criminal case against a lion breeding farm in Lichtenburg in the North West after the organisation uncovered more large scale animal cruelty.\n\nIn April, the animal welfare organisation\u2019s Wildlife Protection Unit responded to a complaint that alleged that animals on the farm were kept under appalling conditions.\n\nDuring this visit inspectors say they found 27 lions with skin conditions and two caracals with obesity issues.\n\nThe unit said the animals were living in small enclosures and had inadequate water supplies.\n\nThey described the farm as overcrowded and dirty.\n\nInspectors removed two lion cubs for assessment and treatment.\n\nALSO READ: As many as 1 000 dogs poisoned per week in SA\n\nCriminal charges were laid against the farm\u2019s owner and staff, in terms of the Animals Protection Act.\n\n\"The charges ranged from lack of adequate vet care, keeping of animals in dirty and parasitic conditions and over-crowding, amongst others,\" Douglas Wolhuter, manager of the NSPCA\u2019s Wildlife Protection Unit told News24.\n\nIn July, when the unit obtained another warrant to inspect the farm, little improvement was noted.\n\nInspectors said they found a freezer with approximately 20 lion and tiger carcasses.\n\nUpon further inspection they discovered a dead lion stored in a cold room and two lion cubs stuffed in a crate.\n\n\"It is deplorable that any animal would be forced to live in such conditions, with such medical ailments. The fact that these are wild animals that are already living unnatural lives in confinement for the purposes of trade, it just makes it more horrific,\" said Wolhuter.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
