Trump (@realDonaldTrump) AMERICAN HERO! pic.twitter.com/XCCa2sGfsZ\n\nMcCloughan laughed when a Times reporter showed him the two images. Military dogs \u201care very courageous,\u201d he said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the dog\u2019s first brush with fame. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted another photo of the \u201cwonderful\u201d animal, who was injured during the raid on Baghdadi\u2019s Syrian compound.\n\nThe defence secretary, Mark Esper, has said the dog \u201cperformed a tremendous service, as they all do\u201d.\n\nThe Pentagon provided further information about the military animal on Wednesday, saying that the animal was hurt after being exposed to live electrical cables but has returned to active duty.\n\nGen Frank McKenzie, who leads US Central Command, told reporters the dog was injured when it came in contact with the cables as it pursued Baghdadi in a tunnel underneath the compound in northwestern Syria.\n\nThe Pentagon has not released the dog\u2019s name. McKenzie said the dog has worked with special operations forces for four years and taken part in about 50 missions. He said working dogs like this one are \u201ccritical members of our forces\u201d.\n\nAgencies contributed reporting", "description": "A conservative website produced the image, replacing the retired army medic who actually received the honor with the dog\u2019s head", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/863b682da0c8ff2d9e27219d33b197bd0f4128cd/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=010eb883ba9469f1425487aabe900fc7", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
