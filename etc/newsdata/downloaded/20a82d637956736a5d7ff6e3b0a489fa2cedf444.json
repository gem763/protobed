Pompeo\u2019s revelation came after Democrats griped that Pompeo failed to meet Friday\u2019s deadline to provide the papers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll obviously do all the things that we\u2019re required to do by law,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be more responsive than the Obama administration was in the years that preceded this particular Congress.\u201d\n\nAn intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claimed that during the July 25 call, Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, threatening to withhold aid if it failed to play ball.\n\nTrump denies the accusations.\n\nThe U.S. president urged Zelensky to investigate Biden\u2019s link to the owner of the energy company Burisma Holdings.\n\nMykola Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma, had been under investigation in Ukraine while the former vice president\u2019s son was serving as the company\u2019s board member.\n\nIn 2016, Ukraine removed the prosecutor \u2014Viktor Shokin \u2014 investigating Zlochevsky at the behest of then-VP Biden, prompting accusations of corruption. Biden has surfaced as the leading Democrat presidential candidate.\n\nPompeo has come out in support of the Trump administration\u2019s push to convince Ukraine to open corruption investigations that could target Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nThe secretary also supports the administration\u2019s quest to get Ukraine to investigate possible interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election on behalf of Democrats.\n\nOn Saturday, Pompeo vigorously defended the administration\u2019s effort to get Ukraine\u2019s president to agree to a corruption investigation.\n\nPompeo explained:\n\nWe know exactly what we were doing there. We were trying to create a situation where there wouldn\u2019t be a corrupt government. We wanted to make sure that they didn\u2019t interfere in our election in 2016. We wanted to make sure that if we underwrote Javelin missile systems, something that the previous administration refused to do, we wanted to make sure we were doing this with a government that was straight up and would use that money for the things that it said it would use that money for.\n\nOn Saturday, America\u2019s top diplomat also defended the Trump administration\u2019s approach to Ukraine. He said it was a typical way international allies deal with one another.\n\n\u201cThis is what we do,\u201d the secretary declared, deeming Trump\u2019s approach \u201ctotally right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I talk to your foreign minister, he pressures me all the time,\u201d Pompeo told a Greek reporter.\n\n\u201cIt is totally appropriate,\u201d he also said. \u201cNations do this. Nations work together. They say \u2018Boy, goodness gracious if you can help me with X, we\u2019ll help you achieve Y.\u2019 This is what partnerships do. It\u2019s win-win.\u201d", "description": "Mike Pompeo over the weekend lambasted the impeachment investigation launched by House Democrats as a \"silly gotcha game.\"", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Pompeo-in-Greece-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
