Why not extend the same kindness to them?\" wrote another.\n\nIn the video, Huang says the dye is imported from Japan and won't harm the dogs.\n\nBut vet Li Daibing told Hongxing News that dyeing the dogs \"could damage the animals' fur and skin.\"", "description": "A pet cafe in China where dogs are dyed black and white to look like panda cubs has triggered a heated online debate over the treatment of animals.
