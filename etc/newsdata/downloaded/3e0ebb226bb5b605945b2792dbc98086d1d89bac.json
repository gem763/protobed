He was widely believed to have been abducted from Hong Kong and taken to mainland China, although Mr Lee denied being kidnapped during an interview on Chinese state television\n\nMr Gui remains in detention in China while the other four were freed in 2016.\n\nThe full extent of the story only became clear when Mr Lam called a press conference and gave expansive details on his extraordinary detention.\n\nWhy did Mr Lam leave Hong Kong?\n\nIn June 2016, newly returned to Hong Kong, he told a gaggle of journalists he had been released on condition he retrieve a hard disk filled with the names of people, mainly mainland Chinese, who had bought books from his publishing house.\n\nBut he said he had no intention of handing over the data and he detailed his imprisonment - in solitary confinement under 24-hour surveillance, during which he contemplated suicide.\n\nA confession broadcast on Chinese television was, he said, staged and acted out to a script.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lam Wing Kee: \"You can stand up against tyranny\"\n\nChina said Mr Lam had broken the terms of his release.\n\nWhen Hong Kong's political leader, Carrie Lam, proposed a new law that would allow extradition to mainland China, Mr Lam feared he would be \"top of the list\".\n\nHe left Hong Kong for Taiwan - an effectively independent nation that China considers a breakaway province awaiting reunification.\n\nSpeaking to Vice news this week, Mr Lam said he would not return home, despite the controversial extradition bill being officially dropped after weeks of widespread protest in Hong Kong.\n\n\"I am wanted by the Chinese government,\" he told Vice. \"It's obvious that if I stayed in Hong Kong, I'd be dead for sure.\"", "description": "Lam Wing Kee, who was crowdfunding for a new bookshop, raised the money in a single day in Taiwan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/33BC/production/_108644231_hi033562773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
