The veteran Irish politician said he hopes the U.S. president will \u201cabandon some of the reckless behavior that we have seen from him in relation to his relationship with China and describing the European Union as a security risk.\"\n\nSondland said that \"saying that you're going to teach President Trump how trade works ... cannot be viewed as anything but a very condescending comment.\"\n\nSondland said he expects any future EU trade commissioner to vigorously advocate on the bloc's behalf but added: \u201cI don't think you want someone handling the EU trade portfolio whose sole approach is belligerence, because that just results in an impasse, a stalemate and then people start to do things that you don't want them to do.\u201d\n\nReminded that Trump's own rhetoric is often forceful, Sondland drew a distinction between language used by political leaders and what he said was more appropriate for ministers and negotiators.\n\nSondland's interview came just a day before major news broke on the trade transatlantic trade front \u2014 POLITICO reported that the World Trade Organization had ruled in favor of the U.S. and against the EU in a long-running dispute over subsidies to Airbus.\n\nAsked for his reaction over the weekend, Sondland told POLITICO: \u201cUltimately, what the United States is seeking is an end to subsidies for Airbus and the recovery of damages. However, if negotiations between the U.S. and EU don\u2019t elicit a change in this behavior and a recovery of those damages, then the United States will suspend concessions and resort to tariffs. The president will ultimately make this decision, and he is prepared to act quickly if necessary.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Sondland also expanded on his recently-expressed hopes for a \"reset\" in relations between the U.S. and Europe once the EU's new leadership team is all in place.\n\nHe said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had made clear on a recent visit that Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen, Council President-elect Charles Michel, foreign policy nominee Josep Borrell and European Parliament President David Sassoli would be invited to Washington early in their terms and that Trump intends to \"actively participate in this reset.\"\n\nPOLITICO's EU Confidential is available on all major podcast apps, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Google Podcasts.\n\n", "description": "Hogan comments on Trump \u2018very condescending,\u2019 ambassador complains.", "authors": ["Cristina Gonzalez", "Ryan Heath", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166060401-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
