We gave it our all, but it was not sufficient. Now enough is enough.\u201d\n\nBrexit talks in Brussels between EU and the UK come to a halt Read more\n\nSuggesting Germany was largely at fault was, of course, deliberate, the paper said. \u201cAversion to Britain\u2019s wartime opponent, and its return to power via Brussels, was a reason for many especially older Britons to vote for Brexit.\u201d Cue the inevitable reactions from leave voters: \u201cMerkel is to blame, Germany is showing its true face, Berlin always wanted to subjugate us, the EU must be smashed.\u201d\n\nJohnson and his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, \u201chave always threatened no deal, paying mere lip service to an agreement\u201d, the paper noted. \u201cThe UK\u2019s latest proposal was obviously not designed to make a deal possible in a short time.\u201d\n\nThe EU is unlikely to give in to this threat, SZ said. But No 10\u2019s psychology was different: \u201cIt aims to oblige the Commons to force a Brexit delay \u2013 and then sees angry voters re-electing Johnson by a large majority.\u201d\n\nTimeline Boris Johnson - three decades of sackings and giving offence Show Hide\n\nFired by the Times after landing a job at the newspaper through his family connections. In an article about the discovery of Edward II\u2019s Rose Palace, Johnson allegedly invented a quote from his godfather, the historian Colin Lucas. Discussed plans to have a tabloid journalist beaten up with his fellow Old Etonian Darius Guppy. Johnson said he would try to obtain personal details of the News of the World journalist Stuart Collier. Guppy talked of hiring a contact from south London to assault Collier. In a Telegraph column he predicted that when Tony Blair arrived in Congo \u201cthe tribal warriors\u201d would \u201call break out in watermelon smiles\u201d. He added that the Queen loved the Commonwealth \u201cpartly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies\u201d. It was written the year after he became an MP. Compared same-sex marriage to polygamy and bestiality in his debut book, Friends, Voters, Countrymen. \u201cIf gay marriage was OK \u2013 and I was uncertain on the issue \u2013 then I saw no reason in principle why a union should not be consecrated between three men, as well as two men, or indeed three men and a dog,\u201d said Johnson. Four years before, Johnson described gay men as \u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d in his Telegraph column. Condemned for publishing an article as editor of the Spectator in which Liverpool fans were blamed for the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. While the article says the event was \u201cundeniably\u201d a tragedy, it added: \u201cThat is no excuse for Liverpool\u2019s failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon.\u201d It also claimed that people in Liverpool \u201cwallow\u201d in their \u201cvictim status\u201d. Fired by the then Tory leader, Michael Howard, from positions as shadow arts minister and party vice-chairman for lying about his extramarital affair with Spectator columnist Petronella Wyatt. When it transpired that tabloid reports, which Johnson had dismissed as an \u201cinverted pyramid of piffle\u201d, were true, he had refused to resign. Suggested that a rise in the number of Malaysian women attending university was down to their desire to find a husband. Suggested the \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d US president Barack Obama had an \u201cancestral dislike\u201d of the UK. Won \u201cmost offensive Erdo\u011fan poem\u201d competition, two months before he was appointed foreign secretary. The limerick, for which he was handed \u00a31,000 by the Spectator, described the Turkish president having sex with a goat. Caught on camera reciting a colonial-era poem by Rudyard Kipling in front of local dignitaries while on an official trip to Myanmar. Johnson, who was accused of \u201cincredible insensitivity\u201d, had been inside the sacred Buddhist site the Shwedagon Pagoda when he began murmuring the first verse of Mandalay, a later verse of which includes the line: \u201cBloomin\u2019 idol made o\u2019 mud, wot they called the Great Gawd Budd\u201d. Criticised for making incorrect statement that the jailed British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been \u201cteaching people journalism\u201d rather than being on holiday in Iran. The then foreign secretary condemned her conviction for spying but his comments were later cited as proof by Iran that she was engaged in \u201cpropaganda against the regime\u201d. Came under fire for describing Muslim women in burqas as looking like \u201cbank robbers\u201d and \u201cletter boxes\u201d. Making the comments in his Telegraph column, Johnson also called the garments \u201coppressive\u201d but added that Britain should not follow other countries in banning them in public. Media firestorm ensued after a neighbour recorded a loud altercation at the home Johnson shared with his partner, Carrie Symonds. Johnson refused to answer questions about the circumstances of the tape, which featured screaming, shouting and banging. A picture of the couple posing happily subsequently appeared in the media, but Johnson repeatedly refused to say who had taken or released the photograph, or whether it was an old picture. The UK's Supreme court rules that the advice prime minister Boris Johnson gave to the Queen over proroguing parliament was \"unlawful, void, and of no effect\" as it rules that his decision to prorogue parliament was unlawful.\n\nIn a piece headlined the Saboteur, Der Spiegel reckoned that Johnson, thwarted in his desire for no deal by parliament, was \u201cembarking on a last-ditch attempt to make it possible \u2013 this time, triggered by the EU\u201d. He was \u201cdoing everything possible to prevent the EU unanimously approving a new Brexit extension\u201d.\n\nBut that was all just for show, said the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad. Johnson and Cummings were putting \u201cmore persuasiveness and energy into shifting the blame for a new Brexit extension than into securing an 11th-hour deal on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister, it said, had seen the polls and knew he could win a large majority at the next election. He may \u201chint that he wants to drive the EU nuts, with a no deal on 31 October as the consequence, but that\u2019s for domestic consumption. He knows he has no chance of success: the UK is heading for postponement and early elections.\u201d\n\nSo Johnson is \u201cnow doing everything possible to avoid taking responsibility for the delay\u201d. Tuesday\u2019s events played out \u201cexactly as No 10 wanted\u201d, the paper said.\n\n\u201cWithout a German reply, without any traceable involvement of No 10, the British public gained the impression that the EU was being intransigent, Johnson was standing up to them as a patriot, and that postponing Brexit will not be his fault.\u201d\n\nAfter the French, it is the turn of the Germans, said Lib\u00e9ration in France. \u201cThe game of \u2018Who\u2019s to blame for Brexit?\u2019 has moved up a gear, with an out-of-control Downing St now firing off highly dubious statements more or less indiscriminately,\u201d it said.\n\nLast week, \u201cFrance was accused of helping to draft the Benn act \u2026 This week, after the EU27 judged there were numerous specific problems with the UK\u2019s proposal, Ireland \u2018doesn\u2019t want to negotiate\u2019 and Angela Merkel tells Boris Johnson a deal is \u2018virtually impossible\u2019 \u2013 in language that sounds nothing like her\u201d.\n\nNo 10\u2019s strategy \u201csurprises no one\u201d in the EU, Lib\u00e9ration said: \u201cJohnson\u2019s willingness to negotiate a deal has never been convincing. On the other hand, his wish for snap elections is crystal clear. What better way to win pro-Brexit votes than to accuse France, Germany, Ireland \u2013 the whole EU \u2013 of frustrating the will of the people?\u201d\n\nLe Monde said that having finally submitted a plan for the Irish border that plainly failed to respect the EU27\u2019s red lines, \u201ca new Brexit extension \u2013 British MPs having legislated against a no deal \u2013 now looks very probable. So the British government has abruptly switched into \u2018blame game\u2019 mode.\u201d\n\nIt could even be, the paper said, that Johnson\u2019s planned meeting with the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the end of the week would prove \u201cjust another ploy, a false pretence to avoid telling the naked truth: discussions have definitively failed\u201d.\n\nDowning Street\u2019s decision to leak the conversation with Merkel was \u201call about showing Johnson to be flexible and the chancellor to be unreasonable\u201d, agreed El Pa\u00eds in Spain, while Denmark\u2019s Politiken said Johnson did \u201cnot seem to believe\u201d in a deal and was preparing for a Brexit breakdown by \u201cpassing the buck to Brussels\u201d.\n\n", "description": "German, French and Dutch media criticise \u2018out-of-control\u2019 UK government", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc284ea0b6bd99bf25b39c6902faccb9de901ed8/0_163_2257_1354/master/2257.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b151d1518de6f48dc509b5b0c7b3f21", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
