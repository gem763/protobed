Everybody thinks we should be first or second (in the league), we just have to play the football for it and that\u2019s what we did. Without character life is difficult and football is too.\n\n\u201cThe boys did really well and fought really hard. I don\u2019t think there is any other way to win here.\u201d\n\nWhile Liverpool stayed five points clear at the summit with their sixth straight victory, Chelsea manager Frank Lampard was left to lick the wounds of more dropped points at home.\n\nChelsea, who are 11th and 10 points behind Liverpool, are without a win in four home games in all competitions, after they also lost 1-0 to Valencia in the Champions League on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a concern, we want to win at home,\u201d Lampard told reporters. \u201cAgainst Liverpool, you know you can lose, they are a strong team. But I expect the home win to come soon.\n\n\u201cHopefully it will come very soon and bring confidence to everybody. But we need to aspire to a level like Liverpool, who came here, did not play their best but still won the game.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool frequently grab the headlines for the dynamism of their attacking play and intensity of their pressing game, but it was their character and resilience under pressure that impressed manager Juergen Klopp against Chelsea on Sunday.", "authors": ["Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432834723&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M09T", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
