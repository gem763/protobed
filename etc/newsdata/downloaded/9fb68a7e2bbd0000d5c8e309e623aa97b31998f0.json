'Following that success I enlisted Gabriele to help form Wiserfunding. We have built models for 19 countries in Europe on SMEs making up to $150million in revenues.'\n\n'The model is built on financial data and corporate governance information but also less traditional data such as social media. There is information on boards, qualitative variables about the company and even macroeconomics factors. It is a blended statistical and analytical tool.'\n\nThe SME Z-score is built on financial data and corporate governance information but also less traditional data such as social media. A rating between A (highest) and CCC (lowest) is given\n\nHow does it work?\n\nSabato, who was a student of Altman's during his PhD at the New York University Stern School of Business between 2002 and 2006, said the model primarily looks at companies with at least a $1million (\u00a3815,000) turnover - though it can be applied to any company.\n\nIn order to have a profile made for them, the SME must have been operating in the market for at least two years. It is then analysed based on a number of factors including its product or service, the quality of it, the make-up and strength of the team and more.\n\nAs with bonds, the firms are given a rating, ranging from the top A to the lowest CCC. The rating scale includes 21 classes altogether plus an additional four classes reserved for non-compliant businesses or those which have ongoing bankruptcy procedures.\n\nAltman claims this is the first service of its type to get ratings for small and medium companies, which is usually expensive to find as there is not enough data available in this area.\n\nHe added: 'We know there will be a turnaround, maybe even a recession in a year's time. There is a great interest in small and medium companies as they form the foundation of the economy in any country.\n\n'People need this information more than ever. We have already had interest in our model from banks and peer-to-peer lenders, insurance companies, and even large corporates themselves.'\n\nWhy should small businesses care?\n\nSabato said the main reason for creating the SME Z-score is to address the lack of credit culture in the SME space.\n\nGabriele Sabato said the main reason for creating the SME Z-score is to address the lack of credit culture in the SME space\n\n'Most of the time small businesses go out blind into the market looking for funding and when they do eventually speak to someone and get assessed, they don\u2019t have any idea where that assessment has come from or what it is based on.\n\n'The SME Z-score will be beneficial to both firms looking at SMEs but also for the SMEs themselves as they will be able to build their own credit culture and risk profile. At the moment small businesses are at the mercy of lenders.'\n\nCompanies working with each other can also take advantage of the service. For example, Sabato explained that a small business's chief procurement officer dealing with suppliers at another small business, will be able to make sure that supplier is financially healthy.\n\n'We also want current Z-score users to use the SME Z-score to crack into the smaller private company market,' he said.\n\nAltman continued: 'We want to become the standard for SME analysis globally. We have already taken the steps to expand into Asia though it is harder in the US because of a lack of good data on small and private companies.'\n\nQuarterly re-rating\n\nAll models are stored using cloud software and anyone can access the platform for an annual fee and search the company they are looking for using their name or company number.\n\nThe fee varies depending on the volume of companies the user intends to assess, be that a large bank looking at 1,000 SMEs a month or a venture capital trust fund manager looking at 100.\n\nSabato added: 'We will reassess the ratings on a quarterly or bi-annual basis but as it is linked through other software used by small companies - such as accounting software - we will also be able to reassess on a monthly basis if needed.'\n\nAltman said there are some risks involved, such as the fabrication of data, as it is harder to check smaller companies than it is for larger firms.\n\n'We do not have the investigative ability to know if there is fraud but if a score jumps from 200 (CCC) to 400 (BBB) in one quarter for example, a red flag may be raised,' he said.\n\n'This might not mean there is something suspicious happening but it still makes people wonder if such a fantastic quarter can be sustained. That company might fail in a year or two.'", "description": "Finance industry stalwart Edward Altman has teamed up with his former student Gabriele Sabato to launch a new tool to predict whether or not a small business is likely to fail.", "authors": ["Jayna Rana For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
