You know, that extremely specific cadence and delivery combined with confessional lyrics that became a full-fledged musical subgenre of pop, punk and eventually rap? The courts will obviously have to decide, but according to their suit, Yellowcard thinks the two tunes are so similar, they\u2019re seeking $15 million in damages, as well as royalties and/or co-ownership of \u201cLucid Dreams.\u201d\n\nIn their suit, the band in part points to Juice WRLD\u2019s professed love of Fall Out Boy\u2019s From Under The Cork Tree. As it turns out, producer Neal Avron produced both the 2005 FOB album and Yellowcard\u2019s 2006 album Lights and Sounds. \u201cSince it is very common for a fan of works produced for an artist by a specific producer to listen to other works by that same producer,\u201d the suit says, according to Stereogum. \u201cIt is likely that Defendant Juice WRLD\u2019s appreciation for the album From Under The Cork Tree led to exposure to Yellowcard\u2019s album Lights And Sounds and the Original Work \u2018Holly Wood Died.\u2019\u201d The complaint also points out that Juice WRLD would have been in fifth grade when Lights and Sounds was released, and has said in an interview that he studied up on \u201cemo pop rock music\u201d that year to impress a girl he liked.\n\nAdding an interesting financial wrinkle to the situation is the fact that \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d heavily samples Sting\u2019s \u201cShape of My Heart.\u201d In May, the singer told SiriusXM how much he enjoyed Juice WRLD\u2019s interpretation of his 1993 song, saying \u201cI love that version,\u201d and confirmed that he had been approached for use of the sample and given it his \u201cblessing.\u201d That being said, Sting reportedly makes the majority of \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d royalties. Either way, take a listen to both songs below and let us know what you think. They seem equally emo to us, but then again, you never know.
