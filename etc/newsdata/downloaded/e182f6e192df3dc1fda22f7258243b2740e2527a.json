He is pledging to stand on the most radical policy platform the country has ever seen.\n\nThe House of Lords was set to debate the bill to hold an election on December 12 on Wednesday after it was approved by the House of Commons Tuesday night.\n\nBORIS\u2019 BIG BET\n\nJohnson hopes he can win just the second Conservative majority since 1992 by promising to \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d if he is returned to power more than three years after the country voted to quit the European Union. He hopes to stoke the frustrations of those who think Britain should have left by now.\n\nThe Conservatives under Theresa May called an election with an almost identical message in 2017. That was rebuffed by voters who decided public services were more important than Brexit, but Johnson replaced May as party leader earlier this year after making a \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to get Britain out of the EU by Halloween, whether parliament agreed to help him or not.\n\nBrexitmageddon: The Boris Johnson vs. Nigel Farage Showdown that Could Blow Up Brexit\n\nDespite reaching a deal with Brussels and winning support in principle from the House of Commons, he pulled his deal from parliament\u2014much to the consternation of some Conservative colleagues who believe he was hellbent on securing an election that would pit parliament as the enemy rather than simply delivering Brexit.\n\nAfter trying to explain to The Daily Beast why Johnson had pulled his own deal from parliament, Dominic Grieve, who was in May\u2019s Cabinet alongside him, said the prime minister had become \u201ca populist demagogue who is unable to tell the truth.\u201d\n\nJohnson has battled to unite the Leave voters behind him by using increasingly hostile, populist language after the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage won the European Parliament elections in May. Johnson accused fellow lawmakers of \u201csabotaging\u201d Brexit and \u201csurrendering\u201d to Brussels.\n\nFollowing repeated failures to exit the EU, Conservative election strategists are hoping a bumper new majority will ensure their next attempt is third time lucky. The election results are expected to be announced in the early hours of Friday the 13th of December.\n\nAs parliament was agreeing to an election on Tuesday night, Farage opened his daily radio show by airily dismissing Johnson\u2019s election strategy. \u201c\u2018Get Brexit done\u2019 is a great campaign slogan\u2026,\u201d he said, \u201cif people believe it.\u201d\n\nFarage hopes to eat into the Conservatives\u2019 opinion poll lead by savaging the prime minister for failing to deliver on his trademark pledge of taking Britain out of the EU this week. Johnson famously said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than ask for another Brexit extension and yet on Monday he signed a letter accepting a delay until January 31.\n\nCORBYN\u2019S GAMBLE\n\nThe polls suggest Johnson\u2019s Conservatives currently boast a 10-point lead over Labour. That is less than half of the lead enjoyed by May when she called an election two years ago, but No. 10 hopes Corbyn will not be able to repeat the campaign turnaround which saw that gap reduced to just six points in six weeks.\n\nJohnson may have to win by more than six points if he is to secure a working majority in the House of Commons in December because of the way the British electoral system works. Corbyn, Labour\u2019s most radical leader for decades, is confident that he can overcome the poll deficit against Johnson by putting forward the boldest platform in party history and shifting the debate away from Brexit.\n\nLawmakers from his own party, most of whom are far more moderate, frankly do not believe him. Many of them fear they are about to lose their seats.\n\nVeteran Labour politician Barry Sheerman blamed Corbyn\u2019s hard Left advisors for the decision to back a Christmas election. \u201cSheer madness to hold a General Election in December & on Boris Johnson\u2019s agenda!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cA clear majority of our Shadow cabinet were against a December election yesterday but Jeremy Corbyn has been persuaded to override them.\u201d", "description": "Christopher Furlong /Getty ImagesLONDON\u2014Britain is headed for its first Christmas election since 1923 but don\u2019t expect \u201cgoodwill to all\u201d in a rancorous campaign that may mark the climax of a Brexit battle that has radicalized both sides.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been manoeuvring for months to", "authors": ["Nico Hines"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8ZpExPOCtqnOOQ49N5.l.Q--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/9c4418fe61399b63889ba62b8f15258c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
