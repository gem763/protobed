'It is a lot of points. They (Liverpool) don't drop many points.\n\n'It is better not to think that one team is eight points ahead. The distance is big - I know that. Liverpool are not dropping points. But we are in October, still a lot of games and competitions.\n\n'We told the players, 'Come on guys, a lot of games to play, we did it and we're going to do it again'.'\n\nGuardiola believes his side should not be thinking about the gap between them and Liverpool\n\nBut Guardiola admitted that City face an uphill task by stating that the distance is big\n\nIlkay Gundogan agreed with his manager in that City were anxious in and out of possession, failing to find the net in a home league game for the first time since May 2018.\n\n'We should have played better,' Gundogan said. 'Wolves did well but we know how we can play and our qualities. We could not put that on the pitch, that is the fact and it hurts.\n\n'The spaces were tiny. It was very difficult to play. When you are not able to score the first goal, maybe we get nervous and don't 100 per cent feel the confidence is there.\n\n'The challenge now is to learn from that. When you are in front and top of the table, it feels great to look at it. Now it is tougher to look at it, there is quite a gap already and none of us are watching the table now.\n\nIlkay Gundogan said City's no-show has 'hurt' his side, but he also praised Wolves' resolve\n\n'We will get opportunities in the coming months but at the moment it is something we have to accept and live with.'\n\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo claimed there are areas in which City \u2013 without the injured Aymeric Laporte, John Stones, Leroy Sane and Kevin De Bruyne - can be exploited.\n\n'The first thing is to stop them playing, how they create chances,' he said. 'My players ran like crazy.\n\n'Of course they are different because football is evolution. It's not the same City as last season and you have to find solutions, the areas to exploit.\n\n'Having a fantastic group of players who want to grow makes me proud. They belief and want to work. The challenge is to sustain this.\n\n'Adama Traore is improving, he is special because he is very fast, he is unique in that and we searched for a moment of talent. He went to the limits for us.'\n\nNuno Espirito Santo has challenged Wolves to sustain the momentum gained from the victory\n\nNuno was pleased to see his side stifle City's attacking players such as Sergio Aguero (right)\n\nGuardiola maintained that City are not playing poorly and insisted his players will bounce back.\n\n'I know these guys,' the Spaniard added. 'Still they are incredibly involved and can do it. What happened, happened.\n\n'Most of the teams who won the title in the past don't win it the year after. We were not at our level today. The previous games were good. It was a bad day, sometimes it happens.\n\nGuardiola insists City will bounce back despite another disappointment in the league\n\n'We started quite well and after we conceded two situations in our build-up where it's impossible to defend.'\n\nWolves captain Conor Coady said: 'It's an amazing result. We came here with belief but this tops the lot with how good Manchester City are. We deserved the win.\n\n'Defensively we were compact and organised and today we were fantastic.\n\n'It has been a tough start but we can now rest, recuperate and go again after the international break.'", "description": "Pep Guardiola admitted that his side 'got nervous' and lacked organisation as they suffered their second defeat of the season to Wolves, leaving them eight points behind leaders Liverpool in the table.", "authors": ["Jack Gaughan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/17/19365126-0-image-a-15_1570378611155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
