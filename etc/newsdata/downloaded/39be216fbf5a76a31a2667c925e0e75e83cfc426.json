REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nBOGOTA (Reuters) - Latin American countries still have the chance to mitigate the economic weakness many of them are suffering through interest rate cuts, but their fiscal options are limited, an official from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday.\n\nThe multilateral organization has warned of the risk of lower global growth amid trade wars and uncertainty over economic policies in some countries.\n\nIt predicts that Latin America and the Caribbean will grow 0.2% this year and 1.8% in 2020.\n\nRegional inflation figures that are close to expectations give policymakers space to react in nearly all Latin American countries where growth is below the interest rate considered neutral in each country, the group\u2019s western hemisphere director Alejandro Werner said at a event in Bogota.\n\n\u201cMonetary policy can continue to be an important lever to confront negative scenarios with respect to what we are anticipating in the coming years, so there is more space for the monetary policy part,\u201d Werner said.\n\n\u201cIn case it\u2019s necessary, basically (central banks) reacting if the economy shows a certain anemia.\u201d\n\nIn fiscal terms the region is limited because of high levels of debt, much of it in foreign currency, which increases risk in the case of foreign exchange movements, he added.\n\n\u201cIn the short term the fiscal environment has a tension because all the countries in the region are basically at primary deficit or primary surplus levels that still aren\u2019t enough to stabilise the relationship of debt to GDP,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFiscal authorities should find the speed necessary for fiscal consolidation in order not to generate such a strong impact in the short term, but should send signals for consolidation in the medium term, so that access conditions for financial markets continue to be favourable for the private sector and the government itself,\u201d Werner said.", "description": "Latin American countries still have the chance to mitigate the economic weakness many of them are suffering through interest rate cuts, but their fiscal options are limited, an official from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445995472&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1NP", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
