When she\u2019s in DA mode, Kamala can be ruthless and no-nonsense, cutting down horserace veterans like Joe Biden with the ease of a lumberjack: in auntie mode, she\u2019s sardonic and warm, quick to crack a cutting joke about herself, or slide into a laugh.\n\nFor auntie mode, Kamala Harris prefers Converse.\n\nSince well before her Presidential run, Kamala has only worn two types of shoes: the kind of serviceable pointed pumps that every other female politician wears, or Converse sneakers, a shoe that has spent plenty of time inside the White House on First Ladies, but which no other prominent American politician wears on the job. Former Presidents have only occasionally worn running shoes to gawkily do sports in, and current Presidential hopefuls who\u2019ve made their love of business-casual part of their image, like the folksy Beto O Rourke or the tie-less Andrew Yang, have stopped short at suede lace-ups.\n\nBut in the past four months, Kamala has worn Converse to speak at the SF Pride Parade, at an Everytown For Gun Safety Forum in Iowa, and at a Labor Day rally in Los Angeles. She\u2019s worn them for the majority of her bus tour across Iowa to promote her \u20183AM Agenda\u2019 of policies and plans that address the issues that keep families up at night (the official video of the tour could nearly serve as an ad for the sneaker brand). She\u2019s worn cream All Stars with a sequined denim jacket, platform Converse with skinny jeans and a blouse, and scuffed-up white Chucks with a blazer and peg-leg trousers. According to an interview she gave to The Cut in 2018, she has Converse for every occasion: \u201cThe kind I wear in hot weather, the kind I wear in cold weather, and the platform kind for when I\u2019m wearing a pantsuit.\u201d Washing Post reporter Erica Warner tweeted that Kamala even tried wearing Converse into the congressional chamber, which has a strict dress code (she was told she had to enter through the cloakroom instead).\n\nFounded in 1908 in Massachusetts, Converse is one of the oldest sneaker brands in the world \u2014 and like nearly all sneaker brands, they were invented and popularised in America (the brand was sold to Nike in 2013). Unlike Adidas or Nike, Converse are grounded in a single style that\u2019s not too modern (read: \u201cHow do you do, fellow kids?) nor too vintage (read: \u201cThe younger generation now tells me how tough things are. Give me a break.\u201d). Unlike Keds, Converse are culturally unisex. They are neither very cool nor very lame, inaccessibly luxurious nor irresponsibly cheap. These are shoes that have been relevant for decades, appreciated for its practicality and universality. They are also uncontroversial. These are not shoes that exclusively belong to a subculture, community, region, or place. Your kid brother, grandma, and Insta-famous ex-roommate might all wear Converse. If the everyperson was a shoe, it\u2019d be a pair of Converse.", "description": "Kamala Harris has two modes: The hardass District Attorney or the hardass auntie.
