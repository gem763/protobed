This ambitious work will be essential in saving two endangered bird species, the majestic Tristan albatross and the Gough Bunting.\n\n\u201cInvasive non-native species threaten the survival of species around the world and we will keep investing and working with partners to defend biodiversity at home and abroad.\u201d\n\nViewers of David Attenborough's Seven Worlds saw the threats to albatrosses on remote Atlantic islands. Chicks were seen blown out of nests by strong winds attributed to climate change.\n\nAs adults, the birds get tangled up in fishing nets, a problem that the RSPB is trying to eradicate by encouraging fishermen to change how they fish.\n\nAndrew Callender, the RSPB\u2019s head of global policy said: \u201cAn international partnership, including the RSPB, the UK, Tristan, and South African Governments is also working hard to save the Critically endangered Tristan albatross on Gough Island. The island, a World Heritage Site in the South Atlantic is considered one of the most important seabird colonies in the world, hosting more than ten million birds. Mice were accidentally introduced by sailors to the remote Gough Island during the 19th century. Now, over 150 years later mice have colonised the entire island, and are estimated to be eating over 2 million seabird eggs and chicks every year.\n\n\u201cAt particular risk are Tristan albatross, Atlantic petrel, MacGillivray\u2019s prion and Gough bunting, but the conservation status of many other species is being severely impacted by the mice. In 2020, work will begin to eradicate the invasive mice from the island, aiming to restore Gough\u2019s seabird populations and safeguard this amazing site for the future.\"\n\nNina da Rocha (Albatross Task Force Project Officer) said: \u201cThe majestic albatrosses of the Southern Ocean seem unlikely birds to have a strong connection to the UK. However UK Overseas Territories, such as the remote island of South Georgia featured in Sunday night\u2019s Seven Worlds\u2019 episode, are home to many of the world\u2019s albatrosses. In fact South Georgia holds around half the global population of endangered grey-headed albatross!\n\n\u201cOnly able to raise a single chick every two years, each albatross in this rapidly declining population is extremely precious. In the show we saw the impact of climate change and increasingly severe weather on albatross, but in fact the biggest threat to South Georgia albatrosses comes from fishing vessels. Globally it is estimated that an albatross is killed by a fishing hook every 5 minutes. The fishing fleets of Japan and Taiwan pose the greatest potential risk to South Georgia albatrosses, and the RSPB is working with partner organisations, fishing crews and governments to ensure simple and cheap measures are used to prevent these needless deaths from occurring.\n\n\u201cWe are also helping more people to discover more about these amazing birds, including Greta a young grey-headed albatross chick living on South Georgia albatross by sharing our #AlbatrossStories campaign.\u201d", "description": "The RSPB is sending a task force to a remote Atlantic island to eliminate giant mice which eat albatross chicks alive.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Telegraph View", "William Hague", "Michael Deacon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/28/birds-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqK50_A0VF2YxpdgOboQIZiFn5_WsP3Sv0zPeoknGT0vk.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
