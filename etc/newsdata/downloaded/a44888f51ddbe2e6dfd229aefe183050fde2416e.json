The principal lyricist for the Grateful Dead died on September 23 at the age of 78, in his own bed, surrounded by family, who have not released a cause of death. So, peaceful, but with a little unresolved mystery, exactly like a Hunter lyric in other words.\n\nTry explicating some of Hunter\u2019s early lyrics for the songs he wrote with lead guitarist and vocalist Jerry Garcia, and pretty soon into your exegesis you\u2019re going to fall back on a sort of \u201cyou had to be there\u201d argument. Explaining \u201cChina Cat Sunflower\u201d or \u201cDark Star\u201d was like explaining an acid trip to someone who\u2019s never taken acid. No surprise to learn that Hunter wrote a lot of those early lyrics while he was tripping.\n\nOf course, if you can write a song, any song, while you\u2019re tripping, that puts you way out in front of most everyone else. In this respect, it helps to know that Hunter was not just some hippy-dippy poet (although he was reportedly the great-great-grandson of Robert Burns). He was also an actual musician\u2014he partnered with Garcia long before the formation of the Dead, when both were part of California\u2019s bluegrass/coffee house scene, and what he didn\u2019t know about how songs worked, Garcia was there to teach him. He was a fast learner.\n\nEven before the Dead entered their folky/country phase with Workingman\u2019s Dead, Hunter was writing songs that drew on traditional music in the best way. \u201cDupree\u2019s Diamond Blues\u201d does not flat out copy songs like \u201cFrankie and Johnny,\u201d but Hunter had plainly put in his time absorbing old blues and folk songs that told stories about thieves, jellyroll, wayward lovers, and betrayal. In the same way, \u201cMountains of the Moon,\u201d which is simply one of the most haunting, mysterious songs written in the last century, tipped its hat to old English balladry and then went its own way. Hunter plainly loved traditions, but he wasn\u2019t bound by them.\n\nProbably the best example of this is \u201cCumberland Blues,\u201d off Workingman\u2019s Dead. The story has circulated for years about the kid who played the song for his grandfather, who didn\u2019t give a hoot for rock and roll but said that old traditional bluegrass song the Dead played was the real deal, having no idea that the tune was a Hunter/Garcia original. (Extra bonus [no lyrical content]: listen to how the song begins played on electric instruments and morphs into an acoustic version by song\u2019s end.)\n\nHunter, so far as I know, never appeared on stage with the Dead, but his lyrics are as much a part of their identity as anything actually played by the other musicians. His words, which managed to be both concrete and elliptical, force a listener to become part collaborator: you finish what he started in your head. Your version is your own, and yet you are part of something larger. Robert Hunter was the master when it came to creating songs that are intensely personal and communal.\n\nAfter Garcia died in 1995, Hunter went on to collaborate with any number of other songwriters, but none as famous as Bob Dylan, who respected Hunter so much that he was the one writing partner who Dylan allowed to change things. \u201cHe\u2019s got a way with words and I do too,\u201d Dylan told Rolling Stone. \u201cWe both write a different type of song than what passes today for songwriting.\u201d Indeed.\n\nThe Dead never entirely escaped their Haight Ashbury, hippie origins, but anyone who\u2019s ever listened closely knows that\u2019s merely where they started. There was always more to the music, some solid core that bespeaks joy, intelligence, and a full-throated love of rock and roll, and no one had more to do with that than Hunter. There was nothing sentimental or mushwitted about anything he wrote (\u201cNew Speedway Boogie\u2019s\u201d conjuring of Altamont and its fallout is as dark as songs get). At his best, and he was at his best more often than not, he and Garcia wrote songs that sound as old as time and shone as bright as a new dime. They stick in your head in the best way possible: you can\u2019t forget them and you wouldn\u2019t want to\u2014they\u2019ll see you through life.", "description": "Robert Hunter's lyrics were folksy, bright new and mysteriously old, and at the heart of the Grateful Dead's identity.", "authors": ["Malcolm Jones"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569359910/190924-obit-robert-hunter-tease_pkuroa", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
