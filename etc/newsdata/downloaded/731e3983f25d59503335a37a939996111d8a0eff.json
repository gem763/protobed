Now in its 10th year, the Lab has helped established New York City as a fintech hub for enterprise technology innovation. Applications for the 2020 class are available at www.fintechinnovationlabnyc.com and are due by Monday, Dec. 2. An information session will be held for applicants on Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\nBased on feedback from senior executives at participating financial institutions, this year\u2019s Lab is seeking companies leveraging innovative technologies \u2014 including artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, mobile and robotic process automation \u2014 and building end-to-end solutions around five major areas:\n\nCloud: Including cloud management, migration and security;\n\nData: Alternative data sources to improve underwriting analytics, as well as tools for data management, governance, privacy and visualization;\n\nDigitization: Automating and scaling internal processes to drive operational and engineering efficiencies;\n\nEngagement: Tools focused on clients, employees or agents, including for customer acquisition and experience, product customization, predictive analytics and talent development; and\n\nSecurity: Solutions focused on cyber, risk and identity management, and fraud.\n\n\u201cWhen we established the FinTech Innovation Lab 10 years ago, few financial institutions were sourcing technology in New York. Now there is a rich ecosystem of fintech entrepreneurs, venture dollars and corporate engagement here that has enabled fintechs to scale and create jobs locally. New York is now a leading center of fintech \u2014 particularly for enterprise solutions,\u201d said Maria Gotsch, co-founder of the FinTech Innovation Lab and president and CEO of the Partnership Fund for New York City.\n\nThrough a competitive process, a mix of fintech and insurtech chief technology officers and senior technology executives from the 43 participating financial institutions will select companies to participate in the 2020 Lab, which begins in April 2020. In recent years, financial institutions have favored more-mature companies, with average capital raised for the 2019 Lab companies exceeding $13 million.\n\nApplicants must have at least a working beta version of their technology that is ready to be tested for either the institutional or retail market. The Lab will partner the selected fintech entrepreneurs with senior-level bank, insurance and wealth management executives, who will help them develop and refine their technologies and business strategies through a series of one-on-one meetings, panel discussions, user-group sessions and networking opportunities.\n\nThe Lab culminates in June 2020 with Demo Day, where participants will present to an audience of venture capitalists and financial industry executives at an event hosted at the Bank of America Tower at Bryant Park.\n\n\u201cThe evolution of artificial intelligence, blockchain and extended reality capabilities is bringing a new wave of enterprise transformation \u2014 helping financial institutions harness new data sources to improve the customer experience, digitize and refine their operations to create new efficiencies, and engage customers with more personalized and differentiated offerings,\u201d said David Treat, a managing director in the Financial Services practice of Accenture, which co-founded the Lab. \u201cIt often takes a team approach to capitalize on these technologies, and we anticipate an exciting round of fintech and insurtech innovations for this year\u2019s class as well as continued industry collaboration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have increasingly seen international companies participate in the Lab as a way to enter the U.S. market and build partnerships with New York financial institutions. In addition, post-Series A and B companies have found the Lab to be a helpful platform for collaborating with banks & insurance companies and receiving feedback on new use cases to accelerate business development efforts and ultimately product adoption,\u201d said Sunny Parikh, director of the FinTech Innovation Lab New York.\n\n\u201cNew York City offers an unparalleled mix of talent, customers, and capital across retail, commercial, and institutional markets.
