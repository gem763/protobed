Ambassador Volker was accompanied in his meetings by US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\n\u201cBased on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me by various US officials, ambassadors Volker and Sondland reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d the demands that the president had made of Mr Zelenskyy.\u201d\n\nMr Volker, who had served in the position on a part-time, unpaid basis since 2017, had sought to help Ukraine\u2019s government resolve its confrontation with Russia-sponsored separatists.\n\nMeanwhile on Friday, Mr Trump unleashed a stream of furious outbursts over the whistbleblower revelations, just days after House speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry that some believe could yield results as soon as October.\n\nMs Pelosi joined others in voicing concern over the president\u2019s hints that the whistleblower should be executed for exposing his or her attempt to pressure the Ukrainian president into investigating a major rival in the 2020 election.\n\nOne of the whistleblower\u2019s key complaints that the transcript of Mr Trump\u2019s Ukrainian call was moved to a classified location by White House staff appears to have been vindicated by an insider, according to CNN. Mr Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who is central to the allegations, has further implicated the state department in the scandal, presenting Fox News with text messages that he claims prove his meeting with an aide of Mr Zelensky was ordered by officials in Mike Pompeo\u2019s department, not by Mr Trump.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2018s envoy to Ukraine has reportedly resigned after being named in the whistleblower complaint that has rocked the administration.Multiple media sources said Kurt Volker, the president\u2019s special representative for Ukraine, resigned on Friday.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock", "Andy Gregory"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Vb6tGKVP4A4ZdDF7qQUTJg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/fe51c68375e2d9a400da50d59a16f4d0", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
