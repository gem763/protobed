These Apps Teach Thoughtfulness.", "language": "en", "text": "TODAY, SMARTPHONE apps can spur new friendships, diverting love affairs, even stable marriages. In his book \u201cDataclysm,\u201d OkCupid co-founder Christian Rudder analyzes data that suggests meeting digitally may even be the most efficient route.\n\nI don\u2019t need tech to help me find a tryst. Recently, however, when my wife once again caught me being a selfish ass, I began to wonder if tech could teach me to become a better husband. Turns out it certainly aspires to.\n\nShe has since forgiven my bout of solipsism, but I\u2019m pretty self-centered outside my marriage, too. I\u2019m frequently late, for instance, when it comes to sending cards to my mother and sisters. I\u2019ve always rationalized this failing as a consequence of how busy I am\u2014a weak excuse. Fortunately, I\u2019ve discovered there\u2019s an app to improve nearly any relationship, whether you want to be more thoughtful with a spouse, your neglected friends, far-flung family or even exes.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Would you use an A.I. assistant to help you be a better partner? Or do you have it down by yourself? Share your thoughts below.\n\nThe most universal of the apps I tried was Monaru\u2014Irish for \u201cmanufacturing\u201d\u2014a full-service A.I. assistant that examines your life and closest relationships, and then sends you tips to engage in these relationships more smartly and considerately ($20/month, monaru.io). For instance, if your girlfriend is a coffee fiend, it might clue you in about a new espresso bar opening near her place and prod you to feed her passion by taking her there.\n\nBefore you can start using Monaru\u2019s trusty robots, however, you first must talk to a real human team member about the 15-20 most important people in your life. During my call, we chatted about my wife\u2019s appreciation for shared time\u2014evening walks, traveling and communal cooking\u2014as well as my mom\u2019s love of Scandinavian murder mysteries. The latter disclosure triggered a message from Monaru that week suggesting I pick mom up a copy of Jo Nesbo\u2019s \u201cThe Bat\u201d in advance of my next visit with her.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building the automation as we go,\u201d said co-founder Patrick Finlay, explaining how they mix human and computer intelligence by cultivating a bank of suggestions that surface per each user\u2019s criteria, but are reviewed by humans before being sent along.\n\nMonaru\u2019s prescient attention to detail is what won over Bay Area app developer Rajiv Ayyangar. After his recent onboarding, it suggested he take his brother to an impressively appropriate event at the San Francisco Botanical Gardens, in which visitors could wander the shrubberies looking for hidden pianos to play together. The app was aware that his brother had moved to the city recently to study classical piano, so its suggestion perfectly connected the dots, said Mr. Ayyangar. Monaru, he added, \u201cdoesn\u2019t just suggest some random get together. It\u2019s something actionable you can do immediately.\u201d\n\nMonaru also lets you set how often you want reminders and who in your life it should focus on. You can ask it to remind you about anniversaries well before you\u2019re forced to grab a drugstore gift on the drive home. Occasionally the app will ask questions\u2014like, \u201cFeeling spontaneous?\u201d\u2014and guide you to find a small gift, make a call or \u201cspontaneously\u201d surprise someone with a night out. It might ask, \u201cWho are you thankful for?\u201d and nudge you to reach out to someone you haven\u2019t seen in a while.\n\n\u201c \u2018There\u2019s an app to help any relationship, whether you want to be more thoughtful with a spouse, your neglected friends, far-flung family or even exes.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSean Bolton, 24, another overworked tech grinder in San Francisco, was concerned his 60-80 hour workweeks were causing him to lose touch with his family. \u201cI was especially worried about my grandparents. They\u2019re not tech-savvy,\u201d he said. So when Monaru suggested he mail them a card, via the online service Postable, he was thrilled. \u201cI did it entirely from my desk. I didn\u2019t have to get up and go find a card or go to the post office.\u201d Soon after, Mr. Bolton\u2019s mother texted him a photo of his grinning grandmother holding the card.\n\nLife, however, isn\u2019t just about making time for each other. If your relationship suffers, instead, from the strain of prolonged money squabbles, you may need Honeydue, an app that tries to eliminate financial feuds in relationships. Dustan Shuman and his partner Andrew Horne downloaded Honeydue after having prickly meetings over just how much each of them was spending, and where. Mr. Shuman said the app helps extinguish that tension: \u201cIt lets both of us see our entire cash flow on a single table, and set goals.\u201d\n\nTrying to establish harmony among a larger, logistics-challenged group? Pathshare (free, pathsha.re) can ping a chosen set of friends to meet at the same spot\u2014a bar, coffee shop, bowling. Everyone you invite is sent the location\u2019s GPS pin and you can see each other gravitating slowly toward the center as dots on a map, each with a listed ETA.\n\nFor divorced couples who share children and want to communicate more considerately, Coparenter ($13/month, coparenter.com) can help coordinate child drop-offs and limits text bickering by letting you set filters for conflict words when you use its messaging stream. When it catches foul language, it subtly hints that you might want to curb your vitriol.\n\nAfter weeks using Monaru I\u2019m not yet the world\u2019s best husband\u2014apparently almost buying flowers doesn\u2019t count. But the fact that the thought actually occurred to me suggests the app is starting to do its job. Now it\u2019s my turn.", "description": "Struggling to be a more considerate and engaged partner?
