A Fourways clinic has seen an increase in patients seeking mental health assistance during the past year. Could the high crime levels be causing long-term trauma among South Africans?\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that South Africa is battling high crime levels. Crime stats paint a worrying picture and there seems to be no end in sight.\n\nIf you turn on the TV, scroll through social media or tune in to the radio, chances are you'll pick up on a new story about the widespread violence in our country. This may be just the tip of the iceberg, as a large number of crimes go unreported and therefore unrecorded, leaving a gap in the stats.\n\nThe perception that South Africa is falling apart could have serious implications for our mental health.\n\nA non-profit organisation (NPO), Fourways-based Witkoppen Clinic, which services many communities, including Diepsloot, Msawawa and the surrounding areas, has raised concerns about the long-term impact of trauma on individuals' mental health, reflected by the increase in people using mental health services during the past year.\n\nSeeking professional help\n\n\u201cExposure to such high levels of violence can lead to complex trauma and other psychological problems,\u201d says Shelley Bernhardt, Counselling Psychologist at Witkoppen Clinic.\n\n\u201cIndividuals who have been exposed to violent crime need to seek professional help.\u201d\n\nIf left untreated, the trauma can affect a person\u2019s ability to function on a daily basis, adds Bernhardt.\n\nEven if you haven\u2019t had first-hand exposure to violence, it can still affect your mental health. Psychologists such as Dr Graham Davey note that constant exposure to negative and violent news can have serious, long-lasting psychological effects on one\u2019s health, and can bring about stress, anxiety, depression and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in individuals who are prone to these conditions.\n\n\u201cNegative news can affect your own personal worries. Viewing negative news means that you\u2019re likely to see your own personal worries as more threatening and severe, and when you do start worrying about them, you\u2019re more likely to find your worry difficult to control and more distressing than it would normally be,\u201d Davey told The Huffington Post.\n\n\u201cSpeaking about your traumatic experience is often the first step to recovery. If you have suffered an emotionally traumatic experience, or you're worried about someone you know, help is available.\n\n\"Talk to someone you trust or contact an organisation such as the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG),\u201d says Bernhardt.\n\nImage: Gallo", "description": "A Fourways clinic has seen an increase in patients seeking mental health assistance during the past year.
