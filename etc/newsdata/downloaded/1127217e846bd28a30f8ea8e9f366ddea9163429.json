Yet still I do not believe, so why not? I have a few reasons:\n\n1. We can distinguish between \u201cstrange and remain truly strange\u201d possibilities for origins, and \u201cstrange and then somewhat anthropomorphized\u201d origin stories. Most religions fall into the latter category, all the more so for Western religions. I see plenty of evidence that human beings anthropomorphize to an excessive degree, and also place too much weight on social information (just look at how worked up they get over social media), so I stick with the \u201cstrange and remain truly strange\u201d options. I don\u2019t see those as ruling out theism, but at the end of the day it is more descriptively apt to say I do not believe, rather than asserting belief.\n\n2. The true nature of reality is so strange, I\u2019m not sure \u201cGod\u201d or \u201ctheism\u201d is well-defined, at least as can be discussed by human beings. That fact should not lead you to militant atheism (I also can\u2019t define subatomic particles), but still it pushes me toward an \u201cI don\u2019t believe\u201d attitude more than belief. I find it hard to say I believe in something that I feel in principle I cannot define, nor can anyone else.\n\n2b. In general, I am opposed to the term \u201catheist.\u201d It suggests a direct rejection of some specific beliefs, whereas I simply would say I do not hold those beliefs. I call myself a \u201cnon-believer,\u201d to reference a kind of hovering, and uncertainty about what actually is being debated. Increasingly I see atheism as another form of religion.\n\n3. Religious belief has a significant heritable aspect, as does atheism. That should make us all more skeptical about what we think we know about religious truth (the same is true for politics, by the way). I am not sure this perspective favors \u201catheist\u201d over \u201ctheist,\u201d but I do think it favors \u201cI don\u2019t believe\u201d over \u201cI believe.\u201d At the very least, it whittles down the specificity of what I might say I believe in.\n\n4. I am struck by the frequency with which people believe in the dominant religions of their society or the religion of their family upbringing, perhaps with some modification. (If you meet a Wiccan, don\u2019t you jump to the conclusion that they are strange? Or how about a person who believes in an older religion that doesn\u2019t have any modern cult presence at all? How many such people are there?)\n\nThis narrows my confidence in the judgment of those who believe, since I see them as social conformists to a considerable extent. Again, I am not sure this helps \u201catheism\u201d either (contemporary atheists also slot into some pretty standard categories, and are not generally \u201cfree thinkers\u201d), but it is yet another net nudge away from \u201cI believe\u201d and toward \u201cI do not believe.\u201d I\u2019m just not that swayed by a phenomenon based on social conformity so strongly.\n\nThat all said I do accept that religion has net practical benefits for both individuals and societies, albeit with some variance. That is partly where the pressures for social conformity come from. I am a strong Straussian when it comes to religion, and overall wish to stick up for the presence of religion in social debate, thus some of my affinities with say Ross Douthat and David Brooks on many issues.\n\n5. I am frustrated by the lack of Bayesianism in most of the religious belief I observe. I\u2019ve never met a believer who asserted: \u201cI\u2019m really not sure here. But I think Lutheranism is true with p = .018, and the next strongest contender comes in only at .014, so call me Lutheran.\u201d The religious people I\u2019ve known rebel against that manner of framing, even though during times of conversion they may act on such a basis.\n\nI don\u2019t expect all or even most religious believers to present their views this way, but hardly any of them do. That in turn inclines me to think they are using belief for psychological, self-support, and social functions. Nothing wrong with that, says the strong Straussian! But again, it won\u2019t get me to belief.\n\n6. I do take the William James arguments about personal experience of God seriously, and I recommend his The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature to everybody \u2014 it\u2019s one of the best books period. But these personal accounts contradict each other in many cases, we know at least some of them are wrong or delusional, and overall I think the capacity of human beings to believe things \u2014 some would call it self-deception but that term assumes a neutral, objective base more than is warranted here \u2014 is quite strong. Presumably a Christian believes that pagan accounts of the gods are incorrect, and vice versa; I say they are probably both right in their criticisms of the other.\n\n7. I see the entire matter of origins as so strange that the \u201ctranscendental argument\u201d carries little weight with me \u2014 \u201cif there is no God, then everything is permitted!\u201d We don\u2019t have enough understanding of God, or the absence of God, to deal with such claims. In any case, the existence of God is no guarantee that such problems are overcome, or if it were such a guarantee, you wouldn\u2019t be able to know that.\n\nAdd all that up and I just don\u2019t believe. Furthermore, I find it easy not to believe. It doesn\u2019t stress me, and I don\u2019t feel a resulting gap or absence in my life. That I strongly suspect is for genetic reasons, not because of some intellectual argument I or others have come up with. But there you go, the deconstruction of my own belief actually pushes me somewhat further into it.\n\nTo sum it all up, agnosticism is pretty easy to argue for, and it gets you a lot closer to \u201cnot believing\u201d than \u201cbelieving.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonathan S", "Heath Rushing", "Peter Akuleyev", "Jim Birch", "Lawrence Kesteloot", "Cpt Obvious", "Minister Of Love", "Scott Mauldin", "Larry Siegel", "Thanatos Savehn"], "top_image": "http://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/raphael.jpeg", "published_at": "2017-05-25"}
