Now, she\u2019s reportedly preparing to sue the restaurant over the incident.\n\nIn August, it was reported that an employee refused to serve Rachel Hollis when she pulled into the drive-thru. Hollis, who is deaf, apparently had her order written down and attempted to hand it to the man, but she claims he refused to take it.\n\nThe employee told Hollis that it was too busy and that he couldn\u2019t do \u201ca full order at the window,\u201d KFOR 4 reported at the time. Hollis told the outlet that she was grabbing dinner for her two sons, who were in the car with her. She had recently taken them to hockey practice.\n\nBURGER KING EMPLOYEES FIRED AFTER POLICE OFFICER SERVED FOOD WITH A PIG DRAWN ON IT\n\nIn a statement obtained by KFOR 4 when the incident originally occurred, a spokesperson for Burger King said, \u201cAll guests should be treated with respect and provided with a high level of service at our restaurants. The restaurant owner has reached out to the guest and her family to apologize, the employee was terminated and all employees at the location will undergo additional sensitivity training to ensure our customers always feel welcomed.\u201d\n\nHollis, however, believes that the Burger King violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and has hired a legal team to represent her, Fox 59 reports.\n\n\u201cYou see the anger in them because a deaf person has slowed their process down,\u201d Hollis\u2019 attorney Cameron Spradling told Fox 59. \u201cIf this is a multibillion-dollar international company, how come they do not know better?\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nHollis claims that when she gave her written order to the employee, he responded with a note that said, \u201cCan\u2019t do a full order at the window. Too busy.\u201d When she refused to leave, the man reportedly came back and began arguing with her.\n\nHollis recorded footage of the incident, which shows the man repeating that \"it\u2019s too busy\" for \u201ca full order at the window.\u201d He then says, \u201cIt has nothing to do with your disability, I have a disability, too.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nAnother employee reportedly called the police on Hollis when she refused to leave the drive-thru and come inside the restaurant.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBurger King did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment over the new developments to this story.", "description": "A woman in Oklahoma City is hoping that justice will be served flame-broiled.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/burger-king-drive-thru.jpg"}
