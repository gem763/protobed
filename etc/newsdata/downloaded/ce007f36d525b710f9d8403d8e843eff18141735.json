But while Tutankhamun\u2019s treasures are being readied for tourists, some critics see the building as a vanity project\n\nIn the vast, shade-dappled atrium of Egypt\u2019s new Grand Egyptian Museum, construction work surrounded a colossal statue of Ramses II, his left foot striding forward and fists clenched in readiness.\n\nStaff welcoming visiting journalists doled out assurances that the towering ancient sculpture was safe from the ongoing building works. On its journey to the new museum last year, the statue was accompanied by 11 horsemen in military dress, amid the sounds of the Egyptian national anthem.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Exterior of the Grand Egyptian Museum on 4 August 2019.

At more than nine metres tall, the statue almost reaches the vaulted ceiling of the cement structure that is expected to house 100,000 objects, many of which will be displayed for the first time, as well as a 250-seat 3D cinema and children\u2019s museum. It will also have a panoramic view of the Great Pyramids of Giza. But when will it open?\n\nThe $1bn museum has been plagued by delays since it was first scheduled to open in 2015, a decade after it was conceived. As construction workers filled the atrium and put finishing touches to intricate lattice-work panels that form the building\u2019s front flank, officials said the project was almost finished. Local media recently extolled official claims that the museum will open by 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Grand Egyptian Museum is a gift from Egypt to the whole world,\u201d said minister of antiquities, Khaled el-Enany, echoing a slogan used to promote the opening of a second Suez Canal channel in 2015, amid claims the mega-project would revitalise Egypt\u2019s economy. Officials said they hoped the Grand Egyptian Museum would attract five million visitors every year, helping to boost tourism and, in turn, the country\u2019s finances.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ramses II statue arrives, with horseback military guard, at the construction site of the Grand Egyptian Museum, on 25 January 2018.

Changing this means reducing harassment, proper public transport and clean bathrooms,\u201d said Hanna. In 2018, a reported 11.3 million tourists visited Egypt, down on the pre-revolution high of 15 million in 2010.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Artist\u2019s rendering of how the Grand Egyptian Museum will look once completed.

British Airways provoked the ire of Egyptian ministries in July when it suspended flights to Cairo for a week, citing unnamed security concerns. Egypt\u2019s minister of civil aviation also decided to levy a $25 service fee on all passengers departing Cairo airport beginning in November 2019, in addition to a $25 charge imposed in 2014.\n\nYet Egyptian officials are hoping the fanfare to accompany the museum\u2019s opening will draw visitors. \u201cIt will be an event you\u2019ll never ever forget for the rest of your life,\u201d promised Mostafa Waziry, head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.\n\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?
