In one, the president has his arm draped casually over the wealthy financier's shoulder. In the other, future First Lady Melania Trump and Epstein's alleged \"madam\" Ghislaine Maxwell join them.\n\nBoth Epstein and Trump owned properties in Palm Beach, Florida, and in Manhattan. They both controlled vast assets. And they both, by the latter's own admission, loved \"beautiful women.\"\n\nSince Epstein's arrest in June on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy, Trump has worked to distance himself from the convicted sex offender. In a sharp contrast from his 2002 comments, in which the president said he'd known Epstein for 15 years and thought he was a \"terrific guy,\" Trump now says he \"wasn't a fan\" and had a falling-out with the financier some time around 2004.\n\nRead more: Jeffrey Epstein: Trump once praised financier charged with sex trafficking minors for liking women 'on the younger side'\n\nBut before that falling-out, Epstein was a guest more than once at Trump's \"Southern White House,\" and according to one of his most prominent victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, Epstein used the resort to recruit her into his sex-trafficking operation.\n\nAlong with Epstein's victim's account, here are all the known connections between the accused sex trafficker and Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.", "description": "Jeffrey Epstein was a guest at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort and his alleged 'madam' Ghislaine Maxwell recruited at least one victim there.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d852bc72e22af71036fbbf6-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
