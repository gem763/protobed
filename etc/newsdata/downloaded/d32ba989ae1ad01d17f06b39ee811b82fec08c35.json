By all appearances, the President's brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\" Romney said in a statement.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, an occasional critic of Trump's who is running for reelection in that conservative state, said in a statement to the Omaha World Herald that if Hunter Biden did something wrong, he should be prosecuted in the US courts, not investigated by China.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, at left, criticized comments made President Donald Trump, at right.\n\n\"Hold up: Americans don't look to Chinese commies for the truth,\" Sasse said. \"If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that's a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.\"\n\nThere's no evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden received any money from China. And a lawyer for Hunter Biden pushed back on Trump's characterization, calling it \"a gross misrepresentation.\"\n\nBut Sasse also criticized House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, who is leading the probe into Trump's efforts to seek foreign assistance to investigate his rival: \"Congressman Schiff is running a partisan clown show in the House -- that's his right because the Constitution doesn't prohibit clown shows, but fortunately, in the Senate, we're working to follow the facts one step at a time,\" Sasse said.\n\nRepublican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, also reacted critically to Trump's call for China to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\"I think it's terrible. It's something that I wouldn't have done,\" Hurd told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day\" on Friday. \"China is an adversary. ... We are in a tight and complex trade negotiation with China now, and so you are potentially giving them something to hold over your head. ... So I think that is something that a President of the United States shouldn't be doing.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida said he didn't think Trump was making a serious request to China and that the President was \"needling the press, knowing that you guys were going to get outraged by it.\"\n\nTrump's public effort to enlist China to investigate a political rival mirrored his moves on a private phone call in July when he urged the President of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. When a whistleblower filed a complaint about the Ukraine matter, it triggered an impeachment inquiry in the House that could doom Trump's presidency. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden in Ukraine.\n\nBut when aides to GOP lawmakers, most of whom are away on a two-week recess, were asked if their bosses had qualms about Trump seeking what amounts to foreign interference in a US election or if they supported the impeachment inquiry, no member of the House or Senate Republican leadership would say it was problematic or should be investigated.\n\nNor would members of relevant and investigative committees, including the House and Senate Intelligence committees, which are both actively investigating the Ukraine complaint, nor the House and Senate Judiciary committees or the House and Senate committees overseeing foreign affairs and the State Department.\n\nAn aide to GOP Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, who vowed last week that his committee would \"get to the bottom of questions (that) need answers\" about Ukraine, responded to an email but declined to comment about Trump's remarks on China.\n\nA few other Republicans -- including Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the number two Senate Republican, and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- have expressed misgivings about Trump's pressure on Ukraine.\n\nIn an MSNBC podcast this week, Cruz said: \"I would have wished the President had not gone down that road. Because at a minimum there is an appearance that I wish he had not opened the door to.\"\n\nBut Cruz said he didn't think Trump should get impeached for asking Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nNeither Thune nor Cruz had anything immediately to say about China.\n\nWhy the silence? Trump holds powerful sway over congressional Republicans, largely because he is wildly popular with the same Republican voters who will decide whether to reelect these lawmakers. Most who defy Trump end up out of office, about the last place any politician wants to be.\n\nHere is the list of Republican lawmakers contacted by CNN, including any responses from them or their aides. This list will update as CNN receives additional responses.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, Tennessee: \"The Senate Intelligence Committee is determining the facts in the Ukraine whistleblower matter, and I want to know the facts before I comment,\" Alexander said in a statement.
