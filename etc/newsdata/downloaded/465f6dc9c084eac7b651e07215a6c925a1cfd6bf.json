Its water tanks were taken out of the upper floors 20 years ago.\n\nAnd now the property is a stone's throw from celebrity Bill Nighy's house in Aldeburgh, Sussex, and half an hour's drive from A-listers Stephen Fry and Judi Dench.\n\nA striking six-storey house which was formerly a water tower and sold to a pharmacist for \u00a3407,000 at auction in 2007, is on the market for \u00a31million. The mock Tudor style building was designed by architect William Gilmour Wilson and overlooks the Thorpeness Country Club\n\nThe fourth-floor is light and airy - boasting breathtaking views across the country club. The high-rise ceilings are decorated with a gold light and the white washed walls are perfectly off-set by the bumble-bee wall structures holding the 1920s build. A grand piano and minimal lounge chairs overlook the views\n\nThe property combines vibrant coloured industrial fittings with minimalist soft furnishings. A statement tapestry-style rug is spread across the floor and leads to a study area\n\nThe Grade II listed West Bar has been put on the market as a five bedroom home with a top floor converted into a large entertaining space which provides beautiful panoramic views of the Suffolk coast. It is up for sale with Bedfords in Aldeburgh and Savills in Ipswich.\n\nIt was inspired by JM Barrie's children's classic Peter Pan and designed by architect William Gilmour Wilson.\n\nOn the ground floor there is an entrance hall and a rear hall, while the first floor contains a drawing room and a kitchen-dining room.\n\nThe second floor has three double bedrooms and a bathroom, with two more bedrooms on the third floor.\n\nThe property's floor-plan shows the vast room and grandeur of the Water Tower which had been disused since the 1980s\n\nThe enchanting building (pictured) near Aldeburgh, was designed by Scottish businessman Glencairn Stuart Ogilvie, and was inspired by J M Barrie's children's classic Peter Pan. Within the same town lies the House in the Clouds which also rises over the east Suffolk town\n\nThe fourth floor is used as an office and library and the building got planning permission for a conversion in 2012.\n\nThe property, which is a one minute walk from the beach and overlooks a country club, also has a terraced garden and a garage. It is two miles from the popular seaside town of Aldeburgh.\n\nProperty agent Peter Ogilvie, from Savills Ipswich, said: 'The five bedroom property has enormous character and is light and bright, with near full length windows and a mix of traditional rooms across five floors.\n\n'The views really are very rare, overlooking the coastline both north and south towards Aldeburgh but also over the Meare boating lake, the marshes and countryside beyond.\n\n'The house is positioned remarkably well in the centre of the village overlooking the country club yet just a moment\u2019s walk from the beach - it is a unique opportunity to purchase a piece of history in one of Suffolk\u2019s most popular destinations.'\n\nThe creation of Thorpeness, which was later designated an Area of Outstanding Beauty, was down to the Scottish barrister Glencairn Stuart Ogilvie who wanted a place to be a playground for his family and friends. Work on the Suffolk town started in 1910.\n\nThorpeness Meare lake was excavated with hidden island and waterways, inspired by Peter Pan, while the charming town Aldeburgh also includes the House in the Clouds.\n\nThe West Bar property channels British farmhouse chic with beige coloured sofas decorated with tapestry cushions and an open log fire. Dark oak storage units compliment the old-fashioned clocks and literature lining the walls, in the awe-inspiring property being sold by Savills\n\nThe dining room sits across the foyer to the drawing room and provides the perfect setting for a glass of tipple. Classical wooden furnishings and curtains make it the ideal converted home\n\nThe sprawling Suffolk coastline can be seen stretching for miles from the West Bar property's windows. Far beyond the greenery, holiday-makers can be spotted lining the beach\n\nA game of tennis can be spectated - with the house looking on to a bunch of tennis courts and a glimmer of the turquoise sea rests behind", "description": "A six-storey \u00a31million house in Thorpeness, Suffolk, which was made to look like a medieval castle to disguise a water tower has been put on the market with Savills Ipswich.", "authors": ["Phoebe Eckersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20185100-0-image-a-73_1572015616821.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
