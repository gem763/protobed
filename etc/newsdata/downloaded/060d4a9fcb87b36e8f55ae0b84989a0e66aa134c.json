This is hurting everyone.\u201d\n\n\u2018NO SAFE SPACES\u2019 TAKES ON CENSORSHIP IN CHINA, POLITICALLY CORRECT WORLD OF ACADEMIA\n\nCarolla stars in \"No Safe Spaces\" alongside conservative radio personality Dennis Prager.\n\nThe movie examines the politically correct world of academia, largely driven by the political left. Prager has called the film a \"wake-up call\" to the American people and claimed free speech is being trampled on to satisfy a political agenda.\n\nSafe spaces, physical locations for students who feel victimized or offended, are becoming increasingly common on college campuses. Carolla joked that the average mid-20th century American would be completely dumbfounded by the trend.\n\n\u201cThey'd have an easier time understanding the iPhone \u2013 a television, telephone, map, calculator, record player, camera and butler all in one device the size of the pack of Lucky Strikes they'd be smoking at the dinner table \u2013 than a \u2018safe space\u2019 on campus,\u201d Carolla cracked.\n\nDENNIS PRAGER: 'NO SAFE SPACES' SHOWS THE LEFT AS 'A PURELY DESTRUCTIVE FORCE'\n\nIn addition to liberal universities, \u201cNo Safe Spaces\u201d also takes on censorship in China. In one scene, Carolla says that in China \u201cyou go to jail if you say anything nice about gay people.\u201d Another scene features a cartoon character singing about the First Amendment while mocking China.\n\nDENNIS PRAGER ON WHY NEW FILM 'NO SAFE SPACES' IS UNFAIRLY RATE\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the documentary has \u201ca couple of risky scenes\u201d considering \u201cChina-owned AMC Entertainment is set to exhibit the film in several of its theaters early in the film\u2019s distribution pattern.\u201d\n\nCarolla said that filmmakers weren\u2019t scared of attacking the Communist nation despite possible financial backlash.\n\n\u201cChina deserves to be called out,\u201d Carolla said. \u201cWe'd be hypocrites if we did a movie about the suppression of free speech but didn't mention China.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Prager said he was hoping for a PG rating but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) wouldn't budge from its PG-13 designation.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cDespite our best efforts to meet the MPAA more than halfway, they have continued to deny us the PG rating our film deserves,\" Prager told Fox News. \u201cI will urge my friends and fans who only go to PG movies to ignore the MPAA\u2019s fake PG-13 rating and go anyway. And please bring friends.\u201d\n\nThe film features commentary from a variety of Hollywood actors, scholars, academics, political figures and media members, including CNN\u2019s Van Jones, Alan Dershowitz, Jordan Peterson, Dave Rubin, Cornel West and Tim Allen.\n\n\"No Safe Spaces\" is working to expand the number of theaters where it will be shown, but Carolla still doesn\u2019t expect colleges to eliminate safe spaces because of it.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice,\" Carolla said. \"But I'm not holding my breath.\u201d\n\n\"No Safe Spaces\" is being released Oct. 25\n\nFox News\u2019 Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.", "description": "Comedian Adam Carolla said the goal of his new documentary\u00a0about free speech,\u00a0\"No Safe Spaces,\" is to simply \u201cmake people aware of how nuts it is out there on campuses and in the media when it comes to censorship based on feelings\u201d rather than facts and information.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
