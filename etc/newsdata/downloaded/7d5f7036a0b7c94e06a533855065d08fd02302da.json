But a closer look at 12-month total returns for the sectors, the full index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.86% is enlightening, and so are the longer-term figures.\n\nHere\u2019s how the sectors and the broad indexes have performed during 2019, for 12 months and for longer periods:\n\nS&P 500 Sector Total return - 2019 through Oct. 1 Total return - 12 months Total return - 3 years Total return - 5 years Total return - 10 years Total return - 15 years Total return - 20 years Information Technology 30.3% 7.1% 82% 133% 395% 461% 187% Real Estate 28.4% 24.5% 33% 71% 310% 284% N/A Utilities 25.0% 27.1% 46% 82% 230% 351% 357% Consumer Staples 22.9% 16.6% 25% 56% 221% 325% 427% Consumer Discretionary 21.5% 1.8% 54% 94% 417% 371% 383% Communications Services 20.6% 4.8% 9% 29% 149% 166% 25% Industrials 19.6% -1.9% 35% 58% 253% 234% 290% Financials 17.1% 1.4% 51% 63% 185% 62% 138% Materials 14.4% -0.7% 27% 30% 146% 191% 289% Health Care 4.6% -5.0% 31% 54% 280% 305% 339% Energy 3.6% -22.2% -10% -23% 39% 116% 222% S&P 500 Index 19.1% 2.6% 44% 67% 252% 255% 237% Dow Jones Industrial Average 16.0% 2.1% 56% 79% 259% 281% 316% Source: FactSet\n\n(All returns in this article include reinvested dividends.)\n\nLook at the bottom of the table. The 12-month returns have been paltry. This year\u2019s euphoria is really only a recovery from the doldrums of the fourth quarter of 2018, when the S&P 500 was down 13.5% and the Dow was down 12%. If the period had closed on Christmas Eve, the S&P 500 would have been down 19% for the fourth quarter, and the Dow down 18%.\n\nSo the 12-month figures are more meaningful. It is understandable that the utilities and real estate sectors \u2014 considered dividend-income investments \u2014 have fared well as the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.34% has declined to 1.59% from 3.05%.\n\nHere\u2019s how the utilities sector\u2019s returns have ranked against the others for all the periods:\n\nTotal return period Utilities sector rank 2019 through Oct. 1 3 12 months 1 3 years 4 5 years 3 10 years 6 15 years 3 20 years 3 Data source: FactSet\n\nThis \u201cboring\u201d sector has measured up well \u2014 it\u2019s worst ranking is sixth for 10 years, a period during which big tech companies have performed very well, taking the market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500 along with it. But the utilities sector has been ranked in the top half for all other periods and third for 15 and 20 years.\n\nAnd it is possible, even likely, that interest rates will head even lower. The Federal Reserve is under pressure to lower short-term interest rates further as economic reports show a slowdown in growth, and the central bank may take other steps to push interest rates lower, as central banks in other developed economies have done.\n\nFor example, Germany\u2019s 10-year government bond TMBMKDE-10Y, -6.17% now yields minus 0.55%.\n\nExchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 utilities sector include the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF XLU, -1.33%, which does so on a market-cap-weighted basis with low annual expenses of 0.13% of assets. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Utilities ETF RYU, -1.41% has an annual expense ratio of 0.40%.\n\nTwo examples of utility ETFs that take a broader approach with very low expenses are the Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index FUTY, -1.25%, which has an expense ratio of 0.08%, and the Vanguard Utilities ETF VPU, -1.28%, with expenses of 0.10%.\n\nA list of the entire sector\n\nHere are the 28 stocks that comprise the S&P 500 utilities sector, sorted by dividend yield:\n\nKeeping the list in the same order, here are 12-month sales and earnings-per-share growth figures for the group through the most recently reported fiscal quarter-ends.\n\nWe have included sales per share, as well as raw revenue growth figures because the per-share numbers will be lower if any dilution has taken place through the net issuance of new shares to fund acquisitions or for other purposes. The per-share numbers will be higher if the share count has declined because of share repurchases. Evergy EVRG, -1.39% is an example \u2014 the company (formerly Monarch Energy) acquired Great Plains Energy and Westar Energy in June 2018.\n\nThe high number of utility companies showing extreme variance in earnings per share for the most recent 12-month period shows that this is an industry in flux, with mergers, unit sales and more complicated deals being announced almost continually. So if you are looking to invest in individual utility stocks, you better do your homework.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of sell-side analysts\u2019 opinions of the group:\n\nAnalysts\u2019 ratings are based on one-year price targets. That\u2019s a short period for long-term investors, especially those focused on slow-growing companies that pay out high (or relatively high) dividends. The lack of enthusiasm for the group is typical and flies in the face of the sector\u2019s strong long-term performance.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Few stocks pass this rigorous test, but those that do may serve you well through market turmoil\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "Utility stocks have not only soared during the past 12 months, they have also measured up well over the long haul.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS500_Citrus_ZG_20191002125317.jpg"}
