[He] goes into the process of saving her, knowing full well that he\u2019s going to suffer for it, he\u2019s going to get caught for it, but he does it anyway.\n\n\u2018And the last scene would be maybe him in a jail cell but at peace for the first time since the movie began. I think there was going to be this component where he couldn\u2019t sleep. He wouldn\u2019t get a single night sleep for a week or so upon escaping.\n\n\u2018The police are looking for him and he\u2019s too haunted and he\u2019s too adrenalin-charged. And at the end of the thing, he\u2019s in a jail cell, and ironically he can fall asleep like a baby. And I thought, \u201cAh, that\u2019d be kind of cool.\u201d\u2019\n\nThis idea was swiftly dropped after he pitched it to his girlfriend Holly and Breaking Bad executive producer Peter Gould, describing how they looked at him \u2018like I was absolutely insane\u2019.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m glad I listened to them,\u2019 Gilligan said. \u2018I think there is a version of that movie that if perfectly executed would work, but I don\u2019t know that I was the guy to pull it off. I\u2019m glad I wound up doing it the way I did.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a riskier ending than what was offered in El Camino, but we\u2019re glad Jesse was given a more positive outcome following his torturous run in Breaking Bad.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nYou can catch El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie streaming on Netflix.\n\nMORE: Netflix\u2019s When They See Us hit with lawsuit over interrogation technique\n\nMORE: What does El Camino mean following the new Breaking Bad movie\u2019s Netflix release?", "description": "Vince Gilligan has detailed an early version of El Camino with a very different ending for Breaking Bad's Jesse Pinkman.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/el-camino-main-acb2_1571128395.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
