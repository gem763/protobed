It is shaped into large square blocks, that are doused with water to make the sand bind better.\n\nOnce the blocks have reached the desired height, the sand sculptor begins shaping his work. Artists start at the top and work their way down.\n\nIt takes around 60 hours and 12 tonnes of sand to make a 4 metre-high sand sculpture. The artworks last for around five months and the sand is reused for next year's Sand Sculpture Festival.", "description": "Created by 40 artists from around the world, it is 200m long, 7m high and took 10 days to make.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/82/78/1000x563_cmsv2_a2079233-e751-5ce7-8e85-9796d6e757ad-4258278.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
