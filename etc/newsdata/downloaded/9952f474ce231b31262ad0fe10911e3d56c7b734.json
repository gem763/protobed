International fell 0.6% to $60.83.\n\nOil prices rallied more than 1% overnight after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a 1.7-million-barrel crude inventory drop for the week ended Oct.18, versus analysts\u2019 expectations for a build of 2.2 million barrels.\n\nBut oil gave up its gains soon after, with comments by Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak cited as headwind for the markets as he said no formal proposals have been put forward to change the terms of a global deal on curbing oil supplies that was agreed between OPEC and its allies.\n\nAlso putting pressure on the market today was a report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that projected economic growth across Asia will slow more than previously expected.\n\nGrowth in Asia could moderate to 5% in 2019, and 5.1% in 2020, the IMF said. That is 0.4% and 0.3% lower than its April projections.\n\nOil is down more than 15% from an April peak as trade war between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two biggest oil importers, dented global demand.", "description": "Oil Prices Drop After Gaining on Surprise Dip in U.S. Inventories", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC2U0WF_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
