Seeking to find a way to wrest control of the narrative, Beijing has stepped up its efforts to sow discord and disinformation through some interesting methods on Twitter.\n\nA report from Canberra-based think tank Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) published today (Sept. 3) said that some Twitter accounts at the center of Beijing\u2019s recent online campaign had been tweeting a range a content including pornography, soccer, and K-pop prior to disseminating content about Hong Kong. At least two of the four accounts with the most retweets were related to pornography.\n\nThe network also included a LOT of former porn spam accounts, which made for an interesting week in the office. pic.twitter.com/fHQ9GjCGGk \u2014 Elise Thomas (@elisethoma5) September 2, 2019\n\nThose accounts were among the 936 China-linked accounts that Twitter suspended last month because they were attempting to \u201csow political discord in Hong Kong.\u201d Twitter made the data about those accounts public.\n\n\u201cSuch accounts are readily and cheaply available for purchase from resellers, often for a few dollars or less,\u201d said ASPI in the report. The accounts tweeted information about Hong Kong without aiming their message at any audience in particular as a sort of \u201cmarketing spam network.\u201d\n\nWhoever purchased those accounts was likely hoping that their large follower count could make the content coming from those accounts look more legitimate, said Elise Thomas, a co-author of the report. \u201cWhen you scroll through Twitter and you click on them and see it was made last week, it looks suspicious, but if it\u2019s five years old and has 3,000 followers or 30,000 followers then it looks much more legitimate. That\u2019s why people buy accounts like that.\u201d\n\nStill, the campaign appears primitive and lacks subtlety. \u201cYou scratch the surface and you see something is not right. For example, if someone who clicks on one of those former porn bots tweeting about Hong Kong protests just scrolls down a bit, they would have seen a huge number of tweets about porn, which would have made them a little bit more suspicious,\u201d Thomas explained.\n\nSome of the accounts have in fact been in use as part of a pro-China campaign since before the Hong Kong protests broke out this year. Some have been used to target China\u2019s most-wanted businessman, Guo Wengui, who lives in exile in the US, since 2017. Others target Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong bookseller who vanished from Thailand and was later detained in China. The accounts tweeted in different languages including English, Spanish, Indonesian, Portuguese, and Chinese. But \u201cthe predominant use of Chinese language suggests that the target audiences were Hong Kongers and the overseas diaspora,\u201d said the report.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how effective those campaigns are when Chinese people living overseas mostly get their news from various Chinese news outlets and chat app WeChat. However, recognizing that many people who are tweeting about Hong Kong\u2014including the protesters themselves\u2014are taking their message to Twitter to garner international attention, \u201cthe Chinese government or whoever is behind this campaign\u201d also has to get on the platform as a result of the \u201cshifting battleground for information over the narrative of the Hong Kong protest,\u201d said Thomas.\n\nIt\u2019s likely China will continue amplifying its propaganda campaign using foreign social networks for other issues beyond Hong Kong, said Thomas. At least three state-affiliated organizations have in recent months spent a total of more than $1 million to grow overseas social media accounts since June, when the Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill that would allow the city to extradite criminal suspects to the mainland. What made the Twitter campaign particularly conspicuous, however, was the lack of sophistication, said Thomas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one that got caught. Maybe there are much better campaigns out there,\u201d she said. \u201cOr it could be (that it\u2019s the) first time they are dipping their toes into operating a western social media platform. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so clumsy.\u201c\n\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world\u2019s most important and interesting news.\n\nMore stories from Quartz:", "description": "The accounts were purchased because of their large follower count, and then used to spam Twitter with information about the Hong Kong protests.", "authors": ["Echo Huang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E5CvEVj3JTXmxsfg8_gdPQ--~B/aD01Nzg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/quartz.com/db589461a18578b14b95df27f7781b44"}
