Facing a Wednesday deadline, Netanyahu said he was returning the \u201cmandate\u201d to President Reuven Rivlin, who will now ask Gantz to try to form a coalition. Gantz, however, could face an equally difficult task.\n\nWhile Netanyahu remains at the helm of his Likud party, his announcement marked the second time this year he has been thwarted in an attempt to form a government.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, with Israel\u2019s attorney general set to decide in the coming weeks on whether to indict Netanyahu in a series of corruption cases, the longtime Israeli leader could come under heavy pressure to step aside. One party rival, Gideon Saar, has already indicated he would challenge Netanyahu if Likud holds a primary.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has received warm 70th birthday wishes from U.S. President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/trump-netanyahu.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
