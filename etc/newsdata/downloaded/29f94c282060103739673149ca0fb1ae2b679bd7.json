Monetary policy has been eased and forward guidance has been strengthened via an open-ended QE [quantitative easing] program. The program\u2019s effectiveness remains dependent on global growth bottoming. Nonetheless, the reward-to-risk ratio of owning the euro, European banks, and selling safe-haven bonds is improving...\n\nThe market implications from today\u2019s measure will be dominated by the trend in global growth, something out of the ECB\u2019s control. Global safe-haven bonds, including German Bunds, are currently very expensive and overbought, making them extremely vulnerable to the recent improvement in the Sino-U.S. relationship. However, the greatest risk for bonds is a rebound in global growth, which we expect to happen by early 2020. As a result, any pullback in yields should be used to build bigger negative bets on this asset class. In Europe, favor Italian bonds over German ones. Italian political risk is receding, and Italian growth will benefit from both easier financial conditions and the coming global growth rebound. Additionally, European banks are attractive. They remain very cheap, trading at half of book value, and they will greatly benefit as European yields rise.\n\n\u2014Mathieu Savary\n\nLong Live the Bull\n\nInvest for Tomorrow\n\nby Heritage Capital\n\nSept 12: Today, stocks are a stone\u2019s throw from all-time highs, at least on the Dow Industrials, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100. Reversing lower before hitting a fresh high would certainly cause me to become concerned about a deeper pullback. While semis [semiconductor stocks] have really been strong lately, other areas of tech have struggled a bit. Discretionary, yet again, has regrouped and is poised for new highs. I can\u2019t even count the number of times people have written off the American consumer, only to be proven wrong. Banks and transports have really stepped up over the last week as one of the most vicious rotations in 10 years has seen buyers stampede into the laggard sectors.\n\nAt the same time, high-yield bonds have quietly kicked it up a notch, when many left the key canary for dead. The NYSE A/D [advance/decline] line has hit another all-time high, much to the bears\u2019 consternation. Bull markets simply do not end with this type of strong behavior. Sorry, bears.\n\n\u2014Paul Schatz\n\nDebt Clock Shocker\n\nDaily Pfennig\n\nby Aden Research Group\n\n\n\nSept. 12: Have you ever just pulled up the Debt Clock at usdebtclock.org and sat there for 10 minutes and watched the numbers? It\u2019s amazing folks\u2026Really, to think that the debt per taxpayer is $183,137\u2026Hey, that\u2019s chump change, right, just fire off a check to the government and hope they don\u2019t cash it!\n\nFurther down on the Debt Clock\u2019s website, they have something called: Personal Debt to Income\u2026OK, no biggie right? I mean we should be making more than we spend, right? Ahem\u2026No, actually, the debt to income ratio is 1.724\u2026And that\u2019s the part that scares the bejeebers out of me, for if consumers can no longer go deeper into debt, then who\u2019s going to support the economy?\n\n--Chuck Butler\n\nWelcome Back, Productivity\n\nPaulsen\u2019s Perspectives\n\nThe Leuthold Group\n\nSept. 12: We have an unemployment rate of only 3.7%, fairly strong wage inflation despite an economic slowdown, job openings exceeding the total number of unemployed workers, and we\u2019re in the midst of the longest-ever recovery in U.S. history. Is there a more opportune moment for productivity to finally make an appearance in this expansion?\n\nAt a time when many worry that a recession lingers nearby, it is comforting to remember that productivity is inherently a \u201crecovery extender!\u201d It allows a fully employed economy to continue to grow without aggravating the forces that often bring its demise (higher inflation, higher yields, policy tightening, profit margin pressures, and real income erosion). Without productivity gains, once full employment is reached, the economy often becomes a zero-sum game\u2014either business takes most of the economic fruits in profits, or scarce labor wins by demanding a larger and larger share of the overall budget. However, with rising productivity...profits and labor incomes can both rise together.\n\n\u2014James W. Paulsen\n\nJob-Market Slack\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nby Regions Financial\n\nSept. 10: Over the past 34 months an average of 4.55 million people per month have transitioned from being not in the labor force in one month to being employed in the next month and, over the past 12 months, the number has been well above that longer-term average. Even allowing for growth in the labor force over time, this is still a large number, and one that illustrates our point about there being more slack in the labor market than is implied by the \u201cheadline\u201d unemployment rate.\n\n\u2014richard moody\n\nThe Yield Curve\u2019s Message\n\nAvalon\u2019s Weekly Market Guide\n\nby Avalon Investment & Advisory\n\nSept. 9: The yield curve has historically provided an accurate forecast of future recessions when the difference [in certain Treasury yields] turns negative, also known as inversion. Yield curves are one of the major indicators that we monitor to judge recession risk, but these inversions typically happen more than a year in advance of an economic recession. In addition, stocks have historically had significant advances post-inversion...Our view remains that the odds of a recession in 2019 are low, and Avalon expects two to three additional 0.25% rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in 2019.\n\nBill Stone\n\nFresh Fuel for Energy Stocks\n\nThe Institutional View\n\nby The Institutional View\n\nSept. 9: The percentage of Russell 2000 Energy Index stocks trading above their 200-day moving averages has risen steadily since year-end! While the Index was virtually unchanged, the 200-day percentage increased from 1% to 10%. This is the first time that the energy stocks have diverged bullishly from the price index since the sector peaked in 2014!\n\nIf this continues, then it would project energy stocks to assume a leadership role once tax-loss selling has run its course. Certainly something to monitor as year-end approaches.\n\n--Andrew Addison\n\nTo be considered for this section, material, with the author's name and address, should be sent to MarketWatch@barrons.com.", "description": "The Debt Clock, the Yield Curve, Productivity Growth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-83900/social", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
