Eskom increasingly began to enter into short-term supply agreements.\n\nEskom's coal costs have risen almost 22% since 2016 as a result of the shift and rising international prices driven by increasing demand from India and China.\n\nThe utility now concedes that it erred and says it has approved a long-term coal strategy \"including the investment in cost-plus mines where required\".\n\nMeanwhile, the government wants coal producers to consider offering Eskom discounts on the more than 110 million tonnes a year of the fuel it burns.\n\nWith supplies constrained and continued demand for exports, they have little incentive to make concessions.", "description": "South Africa wants coal producers to help debt-stricken Eskom tackle its skyrocketing costs of fuel - a problem that's largely of its own making.", "authors": ["Paul Burkhardt"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9396/de0728a1c6784f68980981b38549192a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
