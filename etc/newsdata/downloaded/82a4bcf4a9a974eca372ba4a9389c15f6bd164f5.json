It will also oversee next year\u2019s international conference on the climate crisis (COP 26) \u2013 the most important since the Paris Accord of 2015. We owe it to ourselves and to the world to make sure that climate is not a marginal issue at the election, whenever it comes.\n\nYet maybe we don\u2019t need to worry. We have largely enjoyed a broad \u201cclimate consensus\u201d in this country: we believe in the science, most of us don\u2019t indulge climate change deniers and there is agreement on the need to act. Not for us on this issue \u2013 at least so far \u2013 the culture wars of the US.\n\nThere is a real danger that this sense of consensus creates complacency\n\nBut not so fast. There is a real danger that this sense of consensus creates complacency. Of course we should value the fact that both major parties agree on the need to tackle the emergency. We should be pleased that the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was passed without opposition in the House of Commons, and that the Climate Change Act of 2008 passed by a massive majority. We should not create divisions where they do not exist \u2013 goodness knows we are a divided enough country as it is.\n\nYet for all our relative progress as a country, no country, including us, is doing enough to meet the Paris goal, which commits us to efforts to keep warming to 1.5C or below, and no more than 2C. The UK is off track for our targets for the late 2020s and 2030s, and outside the power sector, progress has stalled. We are consumed by Brexit, when next year we will need to strain every sinew and use every resource at our disposal to get 190 countries to agree to toughen their targets so we can get closer to having a chance of meeting the Paris goals.\n\nEvery party and every candidate should therefore be asked where they stand on the key questions that face us \u2013 not just on warm words and good intentions but on the actions they are willing to take and support. What is your vision for tackling the climate emergency? Are you willing to be consistent in the decisions you take so climate is not simply an add-on? Are you willing to commit to the urgency required?\n\nOn vision, it is obvious to me \u2013 and I believe to the Labour party \u2013 where we need to go. As I have written before, avoiding the nightmare only takes us so far. We need to spell out the dream, encapsulated in the phrase the Green New Deal \u2013 so we meet concerns about economic justice and the climate emergency together. That\u2019s about creating millions of jobs as we change the way we power our country, heat our homes and travel around. We also need to redesign our towns and cities and rethink the way we use our land, improving quality of life as we do. Every party should be tested on its plan to meet this vision, or an alternative, and how they will pay for it in a way that is fair.\n\nNext comes the need for consistency of purpose and singularity of focus on this issue. It is no longer enough to have some \u201cgreen policies\u201d. In a world where we move to zero carbon, every policy must be green. Of course there is a transition, and the transition must be fair for the workers affected, but there must be a framework that doesn\u2019t simply ignore the problem. For instance, going ahead with the third runway at Heathrow without any sense of how that is consistent with this framework will undermine the public\u2019s trust that we are serious.\n\nFinally, there is the issue of urgency. Labour\u2019s conference decision to aim for net zero by 2030 is controversial. With today\u2019s politics and the challenges of transition we face, it feels like a moonshot. But Apollo-level ambition, imagination and determination is exactly what we need.\n\nEnergy bills will have to rise sharply to avoid climate crisis, says IMF Read more\n\nThere is reason to hope that we can achieve more than looks possible at present. Climate \u201ctipping points\u201d are generally about uncontrollable negative feedback loops. But there are positive tipping points, too. We have seen this with the costs of solar and wind tumbling far faster than anyone forecast, driving much higher take-up than anyone expected. After initial support by government, these technologies now make an unanswerable economic case on their own merits.\n\nWhatever the level of reductions by 2030 to which different parties commit, we need a totally different level of commitment by government not for 2050 but for the next decade. It is now five months since parliament passed the climate emergency motion, and apart from the net zero target for 30 years\u2019 time, government has done nothing to show it gets what an emergency means.\n\nIf an election comes soon, Brexit will be the dominant issue. But the climate emergency matters even more to the long-term future of the country. That future depends on decisions made in the next five years. Consensus on the need to act matters. But to save the planet, we need an arms race on speed, scale and urgency.\n\n\u2022 Ed Miliband is MP for Doncaster North and a former climate change secretary", "description": "Having a few \u2018green policies\u2019 is no longer enough.
