Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. Speaking on Fox Business' \u201cKennedy\u201d on Tuesday night Gabbard said she thinks impeachment would be very \"divisive\" for a country that is already divided.\n\nPELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has abused his power, obstructed justice, and violated his oath of office. He puts his political interests over our national interest,\u201d tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. \u201cI agree with @SpeakerPelosi\u2014 no one is above the law. He must be impeached.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who first called for impeachment proceedings to begin in May after Special Counsel Robert Mueller spoke publicly about the findings of his Russia investigation, tweeted on Tuesday evening, \u201cIn 2016, Trump welcomed foreign adversaries to meddle in our democracy for his own gain. Now he appears to be using the same playbook to remain in power.\"\n\nMueller\u2019s probe was intended to examine Russian election interference and whether President Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election. In the report, Mueller said he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice but that investigators did not find sufficient evidence to establish charges of criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nBooker added, \"I applaud Speaker Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry\u2014it\u2019s our one remaining path to ensuring justice is served.\u201d\n\nPelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over an intelligence community whistleblower's complaint concerning a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence is blocking the release of that complaint, she said: \"This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.\"\n\nGIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN\n\nTrump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president vowed earlier Tuesday to release a \"complete\" transcript of his call with Zelensky on Wednesday, though it's unlikely to settle the issue in Congress.\n\nJoe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where Hunter Biden was on the board.\n\n\"This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,\" Pelosi said Tuesday. \"Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.\u201d\n\nFollowing Pelosi\u2019s announcement, Biden tweeted, \u201cPressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent \u2014 to help win an election \u2014 is not the conduct of an American President.\u201d\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Biden called Trump\u2019s alleged actions \u201can abuse of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey undermine our national security,\u201d Biden tweeted. \u201cThey violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution \u2014 that will last forever.\u201d\n\nIn remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the Ukraine aid money to an investigation of the Bidens.\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a \u201cdisgrace,\u201d acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: \"It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., did not immediately release a statement, but sent out a somewhat-cryptic tweet Tuesday night, writing only: \"Billionaires should not be able to control our political system.\"\n\nDuring a press conference earlier on Tuesday Sanders said, \u201cIf you're going to go forward with impeachment. You're going to have grounds to do it. I happen to believe they're authorized to do it, but you got to lay it out.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, former Texas rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke said he is \u201cgrateful to Speaker Pelosi for opening an impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u201d and called her announcement \u201ca defining moment for our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor more than two years, even as I was running for Senate in Texas, I have been clear that I support impeachment,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe all must come to terms with what we face: a lawless president who has obstructed justice and undermined our democracy by inviting a foreign power to intervene in 2016, and who is doing it again in 2020.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cGiven the President\u2019s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward.\u201d\n\nYang added: \u201cAsking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency\u2019s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Yang wrote, \u201cA reminder that successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and then two-thirds in the Senate. Given that there are 53 Republican Senators one would need 20 of them to support impeachment to be successful. That is highly unlikely unless there is some huge shift.\u201d\n\nHe added that he still agrees that moving forward \u201cis for the best,\u201d saying it will allow for a more thorough investigation \u201cthat may unearth new details.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., tweeted simply, \u201cThe House did the right thing.\u201d\n\nFormer Maryland Congressman John Delaney released a statement following the announcement saying he agreed with Pelosi\u2019s decision to move forward with an official impeachment inquiry, adding that \u201cshe deserves our support.\u201d\n\n\"The President\u2019s behavior, combined with the administration\u2019s refusal to cooperate, leaves her no other choice,\" Delaney added. \"Our nation can only be as strong as the rules that govern it.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Pelosi's announcement \"an overdue but important step.\u201d\n\n\"Now the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,\" she said. \"The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment\u2014and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.\u201d\n\nBillionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer said he applauded Pelosi and Democrats in Congress who are calling for an investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged criminal behavior.\n\n\u201cRemoving Trump from office has always been about doing what\u2019s right, not what\u2019s politically convenient,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cWe built a nationwide movement to impeach a lawless president and defend our democracy. This is just the beginning.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Steyer told Fox News' Bret Baier during an interview on \u201cSpecial Report\u201d that he thinks President Trump is \u201cthe most corrupt president in American history\u201d and that he has \u201cmore than met the criteria for impeachment.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did not react on social media, but in an interview on CNN on Tuesday night said the announcement is \u201ca moment of truth for the country,\u201d adding that \u201csooner or later it had to come.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that the announcement is also \u201ca moment of truth for the Republican Party.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled support for an impeachment inquiry. A simple majority of House members present and voting would be required to impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump from office.\n\nVice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario and become the 46th President of the United States.\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "Most of the 2020 Democratic presidential\u00a0candidates applauded\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's\u00a0announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump Tuesday evening.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
