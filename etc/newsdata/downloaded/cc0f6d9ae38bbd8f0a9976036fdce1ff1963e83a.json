It prohibits retail and online sales of vaping products with sweet, fruity, mint and menthol flavors.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer told the Post that sweet flavors draw young people to use nicotine and could leave them with long-term health consequences. She said the state\u2019s health department found youth vaping is a public health emergency.\n\n\u201cMy number one priority is keeping our kids safe,\u201d Whitmer tweeted. \u201cRight now, companies selling vaping products are using candy flavors to hook children on nicotine and misleading claims to promote the belief that these products are safe.\u201d\n\nThe ban also prohibits vaping products from being described as \u201csafe,\u201d \u201cclear\u201d or \u201chealthy,\u201d according to the report. Businesses will have 30 days to comply with the ban.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking important steps to protect Michigan\u2019s youth,\u201d Michigan Department of Health & Human Services Director Robert Gordon tweeted. \u201c'Bubble gum' is a good flavor for bubble gum, not a nicotine product.\u201d\n\nE-cigarette companies like industry leader Juul Labs have faced several probes from federal and state authorities into how vaping products have been marketed. The Food and Drug Administration has considered pushing flavored e-cigarettes to a separate, age-restricted section of stores. Attempts to regulate the industry have prompted a lawsuit by the trade group Vapor Technology Association against the FDA.\n\nJuul said last month that it was implementing efforts to stop young people from using its products, including new \u201cretail access control standards\u201d that are designed to prevent anyone underage from buying its products.\n\nThe company has also supported laws setting the minimum age for tobacco including vaping products to 21.\n\n\u201cUnderage vaping is a serious problem,\u201d Juul Labs CEO Kevin Burns said in a recent press release. \u201cJuul Labs is committed to preventing underage use and has taken the most aggressive actions of anyone in the industry to proactively curb underage use.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBut there are still questions about the long-term effects of vaping, regardless of age. The American Lung Association said it \u201cis very troubled by the evolving evidence about the impact of e-cigarettes on the lungs.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that it was investigating 215 severe lung disease cases that may be related to e-cigarette use. In Michigan, health officials said last week that they were investigating six lung infections that were related to vaping, the Detroit Free Press reported.", "description": "The ban prohibits retail and online sales of vaping products with sweet, fruity, mint and menthol flavors.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/Juul.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
