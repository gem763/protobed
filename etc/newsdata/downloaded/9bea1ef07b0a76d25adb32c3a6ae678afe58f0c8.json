She says a prayer for Fred before leaving Archie and his friends to bring Fred back to Riverdale.\n\nAs they enter the town, its residents come out to honour Fred, holding up signs with slogans including \"We will never forget you, Fred\".\n\nAt the funeral, Archie delivered a tearful eulogy to a crowd of grieving family and friends.\n\n\"My dad was here for every high and every low. He's the greatest man I've ever known. It hurts me that I never got to say goodbye,\" he said.\n\n\"But his spirit and his memory lives on, in this town and in everyone he's met. Fred Andrews will always be a part of Riverdale. I love you so much, Dad.\"\n\nThe job of writing Fred's obituary is left to Archie's best friend, Jughead Jones, played by Cole Sprouse.\n\nThe main characters are seen reading the obituary while Sprouse reads it out via a voice-over.\n\nIt ends with him saying: \"Fred left Riverdale better than when he found it. That's his legacy.\"\n\nThe episode finished with the cast gathered in Archie's back garden, lighting fireworks for July 4.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
