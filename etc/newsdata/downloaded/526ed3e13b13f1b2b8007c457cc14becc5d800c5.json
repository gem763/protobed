Mr Corbyn, who has three times turned down the chance of an election, last night suggested he might bottle it again, meaning Mr Johnson will not get the 434 votes he needs.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, SNP and Plaid Cymru also refused to support the plan, saying they \u2013 like Mr Corbyn \u2013 were waiting for the possibility of No Deal to be removed.", "description": "The Prime Minister is\u00a0determined to press on with his programme of domestic legislation regardless of what happens on Brexit, his spokesman said this morning in a swift U-turn.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/13/20178884-0-image-a-7_1572006263919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
