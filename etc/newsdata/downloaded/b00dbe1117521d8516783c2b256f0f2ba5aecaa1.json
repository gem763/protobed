Pictured: Italian Coast Guard officers carry a coffin with the body of a migrant\n\nDoctors Without Borders says the Ocean Viking ship it operates has been asked by Italian authorities to join the operation.\n\nInitial reports by authorities in Sicily who received the distress call put the number of migrants on board at around 50.\n\nNon-governmental organisations say as many as 30 migrants, including eight children, could be missing.\n\nTwenty-two migrants were rescued from the sea (some pictured) and nine bodies were recovered, authorities said\n\nSurvivors rescued by the Italian coastguard after their ship carrying some 50 migrants began taking on water, are brought to safety at the port of Lampedusa\n\nThe Coast Guard had no additional information on how many might be missing.\n\nThe UN refugee agency said the deadly shipwreck 'highlights once again that urgent action is needed to address the situation on the Mediterranean.'\n\nUNHCR spokesman Charlie Yaxley in Geneva called for the EU to resume its search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean Sea, where more than 1,000 migrants have died so far this year, most of them on the dangerous crossing from Libya.\n\nThe Coast Guard had no additional information on how many might be missing.

Pictured: Survivors being rescued\n\nIn the absence of an EU search and rescue operation, the job of rescuing migrants has largely been left to humanitarian rescue ships, which both Italy and Malta have consistently refused to allow into port.\n\nMeanwhile, the Spanish aid group Open Arms said Monday it rescued 44 people, including one toddler and a months-old baby, on a wooden boat trying to reach European shores.\n\nGerard Canals, chief of mission of the Open Arms rescue boat, says the boat was found late on Sunday in Malta's rescue zone, about 50 miles from the Italian island of Lampedusa.\n\nCanals says that Malta's rescue coordination center told the group not to offer the migrants any assistance.\n\nBut Open Arms decided to rescue them anyway because the boat wouldn't have made it to land without fuel.\n\nIn video remarks distributed by the aid group, Canals says that all 44 rescued - 38 men, four women, a four-year-old boy, and a baby around six to nine months old - are in good condition.", "description": "The coast guard said the overloaded smugglers' boat overturned as a patrol was boarding migrants some six miles off Lampedusa just after midnight.
