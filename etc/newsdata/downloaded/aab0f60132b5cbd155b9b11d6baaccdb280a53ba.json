The USD has been in an upward channel since May 2018. However, since September 13, the Dollar Index has been forming a rising wedge within that longer-term channel. On Thursday, price broke lower out of that that wedge. The target for the breakdown of a rising wedge is a 100% retracement.

After moving lower from the highs of 99.67, price moved to the horizontal support at 98.76, and then bounced. As the dollar broke lower on Thursday out of the rising wedge, it also broke out of the flag and is once again testing that horizontal support area. The target for the breakout of a flag is the length of the flagpole added to the high before the breakout of the flag formation, which in this case is 98.15.\n\n4-Hour USD\n\nSource: Tradingview, FOREX.com\n\nIf the Dollar Index can close below the 98.76 horizontal level, probabilities increase that price will aim for the flag target level at 98.15 \u2013 as well as the target level of the ascending wedge at 97.84. If we reach those targets, watch for a move to test the upward sloping trendline near 97.00. Horizontal resistance is above Wednesday\u2019s spike-lows at 98.90. From there, USD can shoot all the way to previous highs at 99.67 if patterns fail.\n\nOf course as we have been mentioning all week, keep an eye out for headlines and tweets regarding the China-US trade talks.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Joe Perry covering: US Dollar Index Futures.
