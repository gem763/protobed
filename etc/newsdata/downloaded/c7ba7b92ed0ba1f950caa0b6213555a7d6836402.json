Most notably, the Kiwi defeated his idol, the legendary Anderson Silva, in February before overcoming Kelvin Gastelum two months later in a fight of the year contender for the interim middleweight strap.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Robert Whittaker via second-round TKO (punches) Dan Hooker def. Al Iaquinta via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-26) Sergey Spivak def.

Zarah Fairn via first-round submission (triangle choke)\n\nPerhaps that assumption was not only drawn due to Adesanya\u2019s recent arrival in the UFC, but also soft-spoken Whittaker\u2019s aura \u2013 that of a wise warrior. \u2018The Reaper\u2019 nearly had his own soul taken in two career-defining clashes with the hulking Cuban muscle crisis that is Yoel Romero, but miraculously survived 10 rounds with the middleweight division\u2019s resident monster to eek out two decision wins \u2013 the first with a ruptured knee, the second with a broken hand.\n\nThe unlikelihood of any man surviving 50 minutes of brutality against Romero \u2013 let alone winning twice, let alone doing so with serious injuries \u2013 cannot be overstated. It is a testament to Whittaker\u2019s unquestionable qualities, resilience and mental fortitude in the ring. And while the Aussie is less flashy than Adesanya, his skillset is no less eclectic; Whittaker is a mixed martial artist in the truest sense of the word.\n\nSo Adesanya \u2013 whose precision stands out far more than his power \u2013 would give the champion little cause for fear, according to Whittaker\u2019s supporters. For fans of Adesanya, it was the physical toll of Whittaker\u2019s battles with Romero that would apparently leave the \u2018The Reaper\u2019 worn down and there for the taking, along with his title. The neutrals were split down the middle, and many bookmakers had the same odds on both fighters \u2013 a genuine rarity in the sport.\n\nAs it turned out, Adesanya didn\u2019t need power, for that precision of his would prove Whittaker\u2019s downfall.\n\nIn a first for the UFC, Adesanya danced his way to the ring surrounded by backing dancers (Whittaker walked), and his relaxed manner fed into the fight, enabling the lanky, rangy fighter to do what he always does; make reads, find his timing and punish his opponent.\n\nWhittaker pushed the pace early on, entering with jabs and looping left hooks on his 6\u20193 challenger, and he appeared to be on his way to securing the first round on the judges\u2019 scorecards before Adesanya sat him down with an uppercut on the buzzer.\n\nWhittaker was not dettered, however, starting the second round well and sending Adesanya scrambling with a few combinations, but as the frame progressed the challenger began to put a tax on his foe\u2019s strikes, returning each one with a cleaner shot of his own.\n\n\u2018The Reaper\u2019 was closing the distance on Adesanya, who possesses a seven-inch reach advantage, quickly and throwing with serious intention, but as Conor McGregor famously said: \u201cTiming beats speed, precision beats power.\u201d\n\nWhittaker snapped Adesanya\u2019s head back with a sharp jab midway through the round, but missed with his attempted follow-ups, and the challenger sent \u2018The Reaper\u2019 back and forth \u2013 as if he were on a string \u2013 with a right hook, left hook salvo that ended the champion\u2019s night and his title reign.\n\nA salient narrative heading into the fight was that one of these two combatants would be exposed; Whittaker, after all his injury struggles, for having never been a proper champion, or the cocksure Adesanya for failing to live up to the hype.\n\nWhile Whittaker was far from exposed, it was Adesanya who shredded any notion that he was all-hype. The 30-year-old, who only signed for the UFC last year, has enjoyed a prophetic ascent to the top, verbally mapping out his climb with frightening accuracy, then physically realising those claims with the frightening accuracy in his hands.\n\nHis victory on Sunday makes him just the second African champion in UFC history. In front of a record UFC attendance in Marvel Stadium, he called for a crossover with Marvel Comics after his hand was raised. He recently joined Paradigm, the management company whose chief star is McGregor.\n\nAdesanya knows his value to the UFC and Dana White will be keen to cash in.\n\nWith all of McGregor\u2019s recent troubles, the UFC President \u2013 and Paradigm \u2013 may just want to think about leaving \u2018The Notorious\u2019 in the past, where his greatest moments remain, and backing Adesanya all the way.\n\n\u2018The Last Stylebender\u2019 rose to the occasion Down Under, and he will keep on rising.", "description": "The UFC has a new face, and it is distinctly lacking ginger hair and an Irish brogue.
