Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.): Of all the names on this list, nobody polls worse than Bennet. His RealClearPolitics average nationally is 0.5 percent. His averages in Iowa and New Hampshire are 0.0 percent. His $2.1 million raised in the third quarter is enough to keep the lights on, but without getting on the debate stage, for how long? (Previous ranking: 15)\n\nAD\n\n14. Former congressman John Delaney (Md.): He\u2019s only slightly better than Bennet in the polls, thanks to being at 0.7 percent in Iowa \u2014 the state he\u2019s banking on to give him a seat at the table. But that\u2019s despite having spent a whole lot of (his own personal) money. (Previous ranking: 13)\n\nAD\n\n13. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock: Fun fact: Bullock is the last remaining governor in the 2020 race. After missing the third and fourth debates, though, you have to wonder how long there will be any governors. (Previous ranking: 14)\n\nTier 4\n\n12. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii): The Hawaii congresswoman is one of two candidates who didn\u2019t make the third debate but did make the fourth next week. But now she\u2019s threatening to boycott it over the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d primary process. I\u2019d be surprised if she didn\u2019t show up, though. After all, why not just make that case at the debate? (Previous ranking: 12)\n\nAD\n\n11. Businessman Tom Steyer: This will be his first debate, period. One interesting subplot: He\u2019s been beating the impeachment drum for months and months \u2014 long before many 2020 Democrats \u2014 including in TV ads. Now that there\u2019s an official inquiry, what\u2019s the message there? Climate change? More impeachment? (Previous ranking: 11)\n\nAD\n\n10. Andrew Yang: Yang has been getting some heat for allegedly perpetrating Asian stereotypes. He has sought to combat it, but hasn\u2019t exactly apologized. \u201cFor me this was and is the best way that I can compete,\u201d Yang said recently about cracking self-deprecating jokes about being Asian American, according to the Los Angeles Times. (Previous ranking: 10)\n\nTier 3\n\n9. Former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.): O\u2019Rourke went big on calling for confiscation of assault weapons. Whether it was a calculated political move or not, it doesn\u2019t seem to have changed anything for him. And he has allowed Republicans who argue that Democrats are \u201ccoming for your guns\u201d something to actually base that upon. (Previous ranking: 9)\n\nAD\n\nA lot Beto\u2019s campaign now is just him saying out loud all the things conservatives have long believed Democrats secretly want to do. \u2014 McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) October 11, 2019\n\n8. Former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro: Castro has found his voice in this race, taking on fellow Democrats with no hesitation and speaking forcefully about President Trump. But he hasn\u2019t always been that kind of politician, as the New York Times reported this week. (Previous ranking: 7)\n\nAD\n\n7. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.): Klobuchar is ahead of all the other names here because she\u2019s actually showing some life in Iowa, where her RealClearPolitics average is 4.7 percent. But that\u2019s her neighboring state, and she\u2019ll need to show some nationwide appeal, too. (Previous ranking: 8)\n\nTier 2\n\n6. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.): Booker told his supporters he needed a cash influx to stay in the race, and he says he has gotten it. Now he\u2019s apparently leaning heavily on Iowa. \u201cI\u2019m in it to finish first in the caucuses,\u201d he told CBS News this week. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for. And I believe we can. We have well over 100 days to do that.\u201d He\u2019s currently averaging 2.3 percent in Iowa, though. (Previous ranking: 5)\n\n5. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg: Something that has struck me about Buttigieg\u2019s poll numbers: He\u2019s often been one of the most popular candidates among Democratic voters \u2014 as in, as high as the second-most-popular candidate in the first two states, behind Elizabeth Warren. And he keeps raising big money. But he\u2019s not gaining in the polls quite yet. (Previous ranking: 6)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n4. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.): Speaking of Iowa-first, Harris is apparently in on that, too \u2014 which, as with Booker, is probably a reflection of how much they need an early kick-start to keep things going. She has lost all of her post-first-debate bump and is basically back where she started in the polls. (Previous ranking: 4)\n\nTier 1\n\n3. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): The big news, of course, is his recent heart attack. We can\u2019t pretend that doesn\u2019t matter for a 78-year-old candidate. There are also real questions about why his campaign didn\u2019t disclose it until a couple days later. (He bristled at the idea that they hid the news, saying it was a matter of figuring out what happened.) That said, even as he\u2019s lost some ground in the polls, he\u2019s clearly ahead of the others above and in the first tier. He really needs to show something, though \u2014 especially with Warren rising. (Previous ranking: 2)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2. Former vice president Joe Biden: He\u2019s up a spot from last month, given Sanders\u2019s lack of traction. But he doesn\u2019t seem to have a good answer for Trump\u2019s Ukraine attacks. That probably owes to the fact that, even if the allegations about his actions are way beyond the evidence, Hunter Biden\u2019s employment and lucrative salary at a Ukrainian energy company don\u2019t exactly look great. He probably feels wronged in that he has to talk about all this, but it\u2019s not going away. It\u2019s now the focus of an impeachment inquiry, so he had better figure out a message \u2014 and soon. (Previous ranking: 3)\n\n1. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.): I\u2019ve had Warren atop this list for a while, but now she\u2019s a significantly bigger favorite than before. She has recently taken the lead in some polling averages and in early-state polls. That owes in part to her opponents\u2019 stumbles, and in part to her own very strong campaign thus far. As Democrats begin to come to terms with the idea that she\u2019s probably their most likely nominee, we\u2019ll see how she holds up.
