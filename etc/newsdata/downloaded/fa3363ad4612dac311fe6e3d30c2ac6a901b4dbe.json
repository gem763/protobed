Bitcoin fell through $13,000, then $10,000, then $8,000 most recently. And still, some are calling for another 25% drop to $6,000, which is where a number of traders believe the cryptocurrency market will find an ultimate bottom before a multi-year bull market.\n\nBut, there is growing evidence suggesting that the leading cryptocurrency will soon reverse to the upside.\n\nBitcoin Indicators Imply Impending Bottom\n\nMohit Sorout, a partner at Bitazu Capital, noted that a number of Bitcoin indicators are reaching an inflection point, which he believes is where BTC\u2019s price will finally bounce. \u201c[The] Relative Strength Index, positive Directional Indicator, and negative Directional Indicator all have to reset to an important horizontal level,\u201d he argued before adding that \u201csuch levels have only one job: to turn the BTC price around.\u201d\n\nAs implied by the chart that can be seen above, Bitcoin is likely to fall a bit lower to bottom (potentially to retest lows at $7,700), then begin a fresh bull trend, thus reversing the negative trend accentuated by the indicators.\n\nRSI, +DI & -DI all have reset to an important horizontal level. Such levels have only one job & that is to turn the $BTC price around. pic.twitter.com/0uvZWzfQqj \u2014 Mohit Sorout \ud83d\udcc8 (@singhsoro) October 20, 2019\n\nSorout isn\u2019t the only one expecting for Bitcoin to soon bottom.\n\nAs reported by NewsBTC previously, the model that predicted the drop from $10,000 to $8,000 is showing that the bear trend has ended.\n\nThe model in question, which was created by crypto investment consultancy BurgerCrypto, is derived from Bitcoin\u2019s historical returns and the stock to flow ratio and forecasted by Facebook\u2019s Prophet. As can be seen below, the model shows that Bitcoin bottoms in October, begins to trend higher into Halloween/early-November, then surges into the all-time high.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Since Bitcoin's bulls were sidelined in late-June, cryptocurrency investors have been wondering at which point will the pain stop, at which point will BTC", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock_780986371-700x400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
