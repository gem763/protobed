Much to curiosity/embarrassment of other passengers!\"\n\nHeathrow Airport apologised to Beard in its response on Twitter: \"We are very sorry to hear this and apologise for the experience you have had.\"\n\nThe airport requested more details so \"that we can look into the matter\".\n\nProf Beard responded that she did not want staff to get into trouble but some \"general consciousness- raising\" would be worthwhile.\n\nShe replied: \"I am tough, and I have no desire to see the staff concerned told off (so I am carefully not telling you which terminal).\n\n\"But maybe some general consciousness-raising on this one would be a jolly good idea!\"\n\nThe classicist added: \"To be honest, I'm not very easily humiliated, but it was a surprise! Staff polite but insistent (following instructions, I guess, don't want to get them into trouble).\"\n\nA spokesman for Heathrow later said: \"Our colleagues work incredibly hard to keep Britain's skies safe and any passenger is able to be searched in private. We apologise that this did not happen in this instance.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
