People responded calling the tweet \u201cinane,\u201d and that those without much money are the ones who need financial literacy \u2014 so that they can change their lives with the lessons they\u2019ve learned. Others also mentioned his proposal for \u201cuniversal basic income,\u201d which would give every American adult 18 and older $1,000 a month, paid for by a new corporate tax. \u201cYou\u2019re exactly right, which begs the question, would most people use the extra $1,000 responsibly?\u201d someone else tweeted.\n\nYang\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSee: The government has this wrong: Financial literacy alone won\u2019t solve the student-debt crisis\n\nAmericans are sorely lacking in financial literacy, especially among young people since the Great Recession. There was an 8% drop in the number of people who could answer questions correctly about interest rates, inflation, bond prices and mortgage rates between 2009 and 2018, from 42% to 34%, according to a three-year study from FINRA\u2019s Investor Education Foundation. Americans also tended to have better self-perceptions of their financial literacy, the study found. Retirement savings is no safer. Many Americans are unprepared for retirement, in part because they did not save enough \u2014 or couldn\u2019t afford to do so.\n\nBut whether a person needs money to understand it is up for debate.\n\nSome say yes, that how much money someone has does impact how well they retain lessons about money. \u201cYou have to have a sense of driving to get on the highway, you have to warm up when you go to the gym before high-intensity training,\u201d said Dan LaSalle, assistant principal at Olney Charter School in Philadelphia, which has one of the most innovative financial literacy programs in the country.\n\nOlney pays students who enroll in its financial literacy program up to $5,000 a year to work at the school as a teacher guides them through the importance of budgeting, saving and investing. The school also helps them open up a bank account, something many of their parents don\u2019t have. The median household income in the school\u2019s neighborhood is about $33,000, compared with the national median of $61,000. \u201cSo if you want people to be financially savvy and good investors, you have to start early and gradually and they need money to do those things,\u201d LaSalle said.\n\nThat\u2019s why Yang\u2019s proposal for a universal basic income could help Americans even more \u2014 not only would they receive extra cash in their pockets, but they\u2019d have a foundation when they were taught or did read up on financial education. Yang\u2019s proposal could even incorporate some sort of financial education component, to really benefit Americans, LaSalle said.\n\nStill, financial education is valuable whether Americans have big bank account balances or not, said Tim Ranzetta, co-founder of Next Gen Personal Finance, which provides a free personal finance curriculum for high schools. He hears stories from teachers who use this program about the impact these lessons have had on students, and in some cases, their parents, when the students go home and share what they learned.\n\n\u201cSo many teens don\u2019t have much experience with money yet when personal finance is taught in an engaging way, with hands-on activities and simulations, these lessons stick,\u201d Ranzetta said.\n\nAlso see: Not enough teachers know the basics of financial education\n\nPart of the problem may be in how society approaches the definition and deployment of financial literacy, said Joyce Serido, an associate professor and extension specialist of family social science at the University of Minnesota. There are two ways to approach financial literacy, and they\u2019re vastly different. For some, it is understanding and using tools, like 401(k) plans and individual retirement plans (IRAs). For others, it could be how low-income families manage money on a tight budget, and stretch their dollars a long way until the next paycheck comes in.\n\nInstead of talking at people who may not have much knowledge of investing and saving strategies, people may need counselors and coaches who can guide them through their own personal situations, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that financial education isn\u2019t important \u2014 it is very important,\u201d Serido said. \u201cWhen it comes down to it you have to start where the person is and let them dictate the pace at which they can move forward.\u201d", "description": "Does a person need money to understand money?", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR958_yang_ZG_20190924133451.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
