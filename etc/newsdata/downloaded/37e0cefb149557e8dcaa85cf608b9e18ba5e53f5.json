One of the people said a deal is expected in the next two to three weeks.\n\nAnalysts had previously estimated that the company would run out of money by the middle of next year. WeWork parent We Co. had been counting on an initial public offering \u2014 and a US$6-billion loan contingent on a successful IPO \u2014 to meet its cash needs, but that plan unravelled amid questions about its future profitability. The company\u2019s new co-chief executive officers have been moving to slash costs and spin off businesses in an effort to slow its cash bleed.\n\nThe company\u2019s bond prices climbed from record lows amid reports of the financing talks. Its senior unsecured notes due 2025 were up 1.125 cents on the dollar to around 83.5 on Friday at 9:40 a.m. in New York, after dropping to as low as 81.25 cents on Thursday, according to Trace bond trading data.\n\nWeWork\u2019s bonds, which traded above par less than a month ago, have plunged into distressed levels during the past month, dropping more than 20 cents on the dollar amid mounting concerns about the company\u2019s cash situation. Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings have cut WeWork\u2019s credit grade further into junk on liquidity issues.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is leading the financing talks, and is considering making a large contribution, the Financial Times reported earlier Friday, citing people briefed on the matter.\n\nA WeWork representative didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Analysts had previously estimated that the company would run out of money by the middle of next year", "authors": ["Gillian Tan", "Michelle F.
