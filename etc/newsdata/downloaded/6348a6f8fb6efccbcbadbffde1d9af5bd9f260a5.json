Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land. I said to my Generals, why should we be fighting for Syria and Assad to protect the land of our enemy?\u201d Trump tweeted last week.", "description": "President Trump is reportedly considering a plan that would leave a small force of roughly 200 U.S. troops in eastern Syria to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State (ISIS) and further action by the Syrian government.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/syriaturkeymilitaryaction_101519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
