In response, Trump noted that the data suggested the debt would reach a critical mass only after his possible second term in office.\n\n\u201cYeah, but I won\u2019t be here,\u201d the president bluntly said, according to a source who was in the room when Trump made this comment during discussions on the debt.\n\nThe episode illustrates the extent of the president\u2019s ambivalence toward tackling an issue that has previously animated the Republican Party from the days of Ronald Reagan to the presidency of Barack Obama.\n\nBut for those who have worked with Trump, it was par for the course. Several people close to the president, both within and outside his administration, confirmed that the national debt has never bothered him in a truly meaningful way, despite his public lip service. \u201cI never once heard him talk about the debt,\u201d one former senior White House official attested.\n\nMarc Short, who until recently worked for Trump as his legislative affairs director, said he believed the president recognized \u201cthe threat that debt poses\u201d and he pointed to Trump\u2019s concern \u201cabout rising interest rates\u201d as evidence of his concern for the matter.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no doubt this administration and this Congress need to address spending because we have out-of-control entitlement programs,\u201d Short said, adding, \u201cit\u2019s fair to say that... the president would be skeptical of anyone who claims that they would know exactly when a [debt] crisis really comes home to roost.\u201d\n\nRecent reports have suggested that Trump is determined, at least rhetorically, to address the issue. Hogan Gidley, a spokesman for the president, noted that the president and his team have proposed policies to achieve some deficit reduction, \u201cincluding in his first budget that actually would\u2019ve balanced in 10 years, a historic, common-sense rescissions proposal.\u201d\n\nBut Gidley also passed the buck to the legislative branch. \u201cWhile the president has and will continue to do everything in his power to rein in Washington\u2019s out-of-control spending,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and it\u2019s time for them to work with this president to reduce the debt.\u201d\n\nThose close to Trump say that one reason the issue of debt reduction has never been an animating one for him is because he is convinced that it can be solved through means other than tax hikes or sharp spending reductions.\n\nStephen Moore, a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation and an economic adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, recalled making visual presentations to Trump in mid-2016 that showed him the severity of the debt problem. But Moore told The Daily Beast that he personally assured candidate Trump that it could be dealt with by focusing on economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat was why, when he was confronted with these nightmare scenarios on the debt, I think he rejected them, because if you grow the economy\u2026 you don\u2019t have a debt problem,\u201d Moore continued. \u201cI know a few times when people would bring up the enormous debt, he would say, \u2018We\u2019re gonna grow our way out of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMoore has since championed this approach to tackling the debt as a key part of \u201cTrumponomics,\u201d and has co-authored a book supporting it.\n\nAs Moore recalled, a belief that robust economic growth would solve all problems was the way Trump\u2014starting in 2016\u2014justified the cost of his ambitious proposals to slash taxes, pursue big infrastructure projects, and simply avoid massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Since then, the president has continued to show indifference over the national debt, to the consternation of more traditionally conservative associates.\n\nOne current senior Trump administration official vented that Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t really care\u201d about actually attacking the debt \u201ccrisis,\u201d and prefers simply \u201cjobs and growth, whatever that means.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, the Republican Party has gone along. Over the first two years of the Trump administration, congressional Republicans have slashed taxes dramatically while increasing defense and discretionary spending, all without giving much indication that they\u2019re going to take a stab at dramatically gutting certain popular entitlements.\n\nThe results have not been what Trump and Moore have promised; at least not yet. Economic growth increased over the past year\u2014including a robust 4.1 percent in the second quarter of 2018\u2014but the federal deficit has ballooned as well, in part because the government has taken in less revenue because of the tax cuts. Current forecasts are not too rosy about the future economy.\n\nRecently, both Trump and some Republican lawmakers have hinted at regret over their approach. Earlier this year, Trump conveyed his disappointment with signing a large spending bill, particularly after he saw typically friendly allies on Fox News tear into him for supporting legislation that they viewed as funding Democratic priorities, exacerbating the national debt, and ditching his pledge to build a gigantic border wall, according to a report at the time in Axios.\n\nSources close to the president tell The Daily Beast that Trump was genuinely taken aback by the severity of this mini-revolt from MAGA loyalists.\n\nHowever, right-leaning reformers shouldn\u2019t be holding their breath.\n\nThe Washington Post recently reported that Trump had instructed his Cabinet to devise plans to trim their budgets in an effort to reduce the federal deficit. But Trump also set strict limits on what sorts of programs could be cut\u2014and quickly proceeded to propose increased spending in other areas of the federal government.\n\n\u201cHe understands the messaging of it,\u201d the former senior White House official told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t a doctrinaire conservative who deeply cares about the national debt, especially not on his watch\u2026 It\u2019s not actually a top priority for him\u2026 He understands the political nature of the debt but it\u2019s clearly not, frankly, something he sees as crucial to his legacy.\u201d\n\nThe former Trump official adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to haunt him.\u201d", "description": "The president thinks the balancing of the nation\u2019s books is going to, ultimately, be a future president\u2019s problem.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Lachlan Markay", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3375,w_6000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1543977245/181127-trump-debt-tease_tj688a", "published_at": "2018-12-05"}
