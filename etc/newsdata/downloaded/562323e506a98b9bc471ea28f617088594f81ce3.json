REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nWhat it is not is a watershed moment as Federal Reserve policymakers weigh where next with interest rates.\n\n\u201cWhile not everyone fully shares economic opportunities and the economy faces some risks, overall it is \u2014 as I like to say \u2014 in a good place,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in brief remarks in Washington. \u201cOur job is to keep it there as long as possible.\u201d\n\nPowell and his top lieutenants, Vice Chair Richard Clarida and New York Fed President John Williams, have repeatedly used similar phrasing to describe the economy and the Fed\u2019s role, as Fed policymakers delivered rate cuts in both July and September, despite opposition to the move from several of their number.\n\nFriday\u2019s jobs report, which showed the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low but wage growth barely budged, clearly had not shifted Powell\u2019s view.\n\nTraders of rate futures were quick to judge the Fed would stay on track for at least one more interest-rate cut this year. But they also pared bets on a fourth rate cut in 2019 that they had piled into earlier in the week after data showed factory activity was contracting and growth in the massive U.S services sector was slowing.\n\nAs Fed policymakers sift through the economic data ahead of their next interest-rate setting meeting Oct. 29-30, they remain divided as they assess the downside risks of trade disputes and of geopolitical tensions to the economic outlook. September\u2019s rate cut drew three dissents of 10 votes; at least two non-voters have since said they too disagreed with the decision.\n\nPart of the problem is that, as with Friday\u2019s jobs report, the data are not sending a crystal clear message.\n\nPolicymakers are \u201cwrestling with\u201d figuring out if the U.S. economy is headed for a \u201csoft landing\u201d or a \u201csteep decline,\u201d Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said during a moderated discussion at Tulane University in New Orleans.\n\nProlonged U.S. trade tensions with China are causing some businesses to sit \u201con the sidelines\u201d and have the potential to affect consumers, he said. Still, he projects that the economy will grow above-trend in 2019, lifted by a tight labor market with an unemployment rate at 3.5%.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of reasons to be optimistic about this economy,\u201d Bostic said. \u201cBut also we need to recognize that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there.\u201d\n\nKEEPING AN OPEN MIND\n\nBostic\u2019s counterpart at the Boston Fed, Eric Rosengren, who opposed the central bank\u2019s two rate cuts this year, said he too was parsing the data, and had an \u201copen mind\u201d on policy ahead.U.S. employment growth was getting to what he \u201cwould expect in kind of a stable economy,\u201d Rosengren told CNBC in an interview. \u201cI think the bigger question is whether it ends up being weaker from here and that depends importantly on what happens on the consumer side of the economy.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department report Friday showed the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% last month as U.S. employers added 136,000 jobs, down from 168,000 jobs created in August but still plenty to keep up with labor market growth.\n\nRosengren said he is attentive to whether slowing global growth and trade tensions begin to have broader effects on the U.S economy, but that so far though tariffs and trade uncertainty has slowed exports and manufacturing, the consumer continues to buy goods, including cars.\n\n\u201cWe still have more data between now and when the meeting actually occurs.\u201d\n\nAnalysts for their part largely ratified the rate-futures view of the takeaway from the data so far\n\n\u201cGiven the mounting global growth concerns and worrisome forward-looking indicators, we believe it would have taken a much stronger number to convince Fed leadership that they have already taken out enough insurance against downside risks,\u201d JP Morgan economist Michael Feroli told investors in a note.\n\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who has wanted the Fed to make bigger rate cuts in part to aid the pocketbooks of regular Americans, on Friday said monetary policy had a \u201chuge role to play\u201d in keeping the labor market strong.\n\n\u201cThe benefits (of a tight labor market) are amazing, and we somehow have to keep it going,\u201d he said.", "description": "Last month's slowdown in U.S. jobs growth may be a sign weakness in manufacturing is spreading to the broader economy, or it could simply reflect an expected downshift in a fundamentally healthy labor market.", "authors": ["Ann Saphir", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437154256&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931J6", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
