The company creates high-end experiences for an elite clientele of millionaires, billionaires, celebrities, business leaders, socialites, and artists at events like the Monaco Grand Prix, the Monaco Yacht Show, Art Basel in Miami, the holiday season in St. Bart's, and even the Super Bowl.\n\nDuring the Monaco Yacht Show, which kicks off this year on September 25, Frankl, an ex-Olympian, hosts extravagant superyacht parties and ultra-exclusive dinners.\n\nMy Yacht Group founder and CEO Nicholas Frankl and his twin sister, COO Annabelle Frankl. My Yacht Group\n\nFor these events, Frankl and his twin sister, My Yacht Group COO Annabelle Frankl, partner with luxury brands including Axiom Space, Bulgari, Chateau D'Esclans, Perrier-Jouet, and Caviar Perlita.\n\nIn a recent interview, Frankl gave Business Insider the low-down on what goes into throwing a superyacht party for the ultra-wealthy at the Monaco Yacht Show.\n\nThrowing a superyacht party for billionaires and celebs doesn't come cheap\n\nYou can't throw a superyacht party like he does for under six figures, Frankl said.\n\nFirst of all, if you don't have your own yacht, you'll have to charter one, which typically costs between $250,000 and $1 million per week plus expenses. One of the yachts Frankl has chartered, a 254-foot vessel called Legend, charges more than $540,000 per week in the summer months.\n\nThen there's the staff, which includes bartenders and catering staff, security, hostesses \u2014 Frankl says they hire \"angels\" who roam around pouring ros\u00e9 for guests \u2014 and musicians. There's always live music: a five-piece band that strolls around the yacht, as well as a DJ on the top deck.\n\nOne yacht Frankl has chartered, Legend, costs more than $540,000 per week in the summer months. My Yacht Group\n\nAnd don't forget the food and drink: caviar, ros\u00e9, and Champagne galore. Because according to Frankl, the types of guests who attend these parties will be expecting only the best.\n\nThe clientele is ultra-exclusive \u2014 and good luck getting in if you don't know the host\n\nBetween 120 to 150 people usually attend Frankl's yacht parties in Monaco, and of course, they're invite-only.\n\n\"The difference between our events and the majority of every other event that you'll ever go to in your life is that I know 80% of the guest list,\" Frankl said. \"... [so] you could say, 'how do you know Nicholas and Annabelle?' and there is an immediate point of connection.\"\n\nThe ultra-exclusive guest list keeps the yacht parties feeling intimate, Frankl says. My Yacht Group\n\nThe guests might discover they both met their hosts at Art Basel or Hong Kong or last year's Grand Prix, he says. This keeps the atmosphere feeling intimate.\n\n\"It's not a bunch random and discombobulated strangers,\" Frankl said. \"There's really a connection amongst the people.\"\n\nIndeed, Frankl says one of his primary aims is connecting people. My Yacht Group's tagline is \"Connecting the world's most interesting people.\"\n\nNo need to go to the bar: Hostesses known as \"angels\" roam around pouring ros\u00e9 for guests. My Yacht Group\n\nAt Frankl's events, that could mean royalty \u2014 Prince Albert II of Monaco has been his guest\u2014 as well as astronauts, doctors, scientists, or athletes. Curating the guest list is something he takes great pride in.\n\n\"It's a broad spectrum of interesting [people] and, in general, high achievers in their fields,\" he said. \"And when you put those people together on a superyacht with the right atmosphere and the right level of exclusivity, then people tend to have a really great time and they thank you for it.\"\n\n100 bottles of Champagne and 35 ounces of caviar\n\nOf course, when you get so many interesting \u2014 and wealthy \u2014 people together on a superyacht, you have to make sure the food and drink is on the same level as the guest list.\n\n\"If you're hosting a large superyacht soiree for 125 to 150 VIPs, it goes without saying that they expect the finest food and wine and that's what we deliver,\" Frankl said.\n\nVIP superyacht guests expect the finest foods. My Yacht Group\n\nMy Yacht Group hires A Roca Gourmet to cater their Monaco yacht parties.\n\n\"We go through more than a kilo of caviar,\" Frankl told Business Insider. \"We're serving lobster, langoustines, beef.\"\n\nCanap\u00e9s are typically served to start, and then there's a \"light cooking station\" with dishes like risotto, caviar, and vegan options, followed by a variety of desserts.\n\nFrankl serves Rock Angel Ros\u00e9 from Ch\u00e2teau D'Esclans at his yacht parties. My Yacht Group\n\nAll the food must be \"yacht-friendly,\" meaning you can eat it while standing and chatting, and it's not crumbling through your fingers onto the decking, Frankl says.\n\nAnd then there's the alcohol. Over the course of a night's yacht party, the guests will go through about 100 bottles of Champagne, Frankl said.\n\nThat's in addition to the Rock Angel Ros\u00e9 from Ch\u00e2teau D'Esclans. Frankl said they usually go through \"quite a number\" of their three-liter Double Magnum bottles, which retail for about $190 each.", "description": "Nicholas Frankl of My Yacht Group throws yacht parties and other events for an exclusive, wealthy clientele, including royalty, business leaders, and celebs.", "authors": ["Katie Warren"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8280d32e22af0f0973ba93-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
