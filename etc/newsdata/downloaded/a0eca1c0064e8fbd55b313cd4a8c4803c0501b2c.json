Tammy is more than just a poacher\n\nQuestions were asked when Chelsea gave Tammy Abraham the \u2018cursed\u2019 no.9 shirt. Those questions seem to be null and void after the young Englishman\u2019s hattrick against Wolves, taking his tally to seven goals for the season.\n\nPerhaps, the most impressive thing about Abraham\u2019s hattrick was the difference between the three goals. The first was a trademark poacher\u2019s goal, taking advantage of a loose ball and finishing on the turn with just two touches. The second was a well-timed header, and the third a fantastic show of skill, pace and finishing ability.\n\nAbraham\u2019s poaching instincts were crucial in the Championship, where he never scored outside the box, and he seems to have now stepped up a gear that many doubted he possessed.\n\n2. Leicester struggle when teams sit back\n\nWith Manchester United\u2019s injury woes and indifferent form heading into the game, Leicester were predicted to further put pressure on manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who was without a win since the opening day.\n\nHowever, an early penalty for United meant that Leicester were chasing the game for more than 80 minutes. Such a scenario is rarely when Leicester are at the best, especially when spearheaded by Jamie Vardy. They failed to create a good opening for Vardy, nor did they attack United with numbers at the end of the game as one might have expected.\n\nThat Leicester struggled to break down United is no surprise given their history of good performances against teams that have attacked rather than sat back \u2013 the 1-1 draw against Chelsea and the 3-1 win over Bournemouth come to mind.\n\n3. Laporte is crucial\n\nIf it was not clear before this weekend, it is now as clear as the Pope is Catholic that Aymeric Laporte is essential to Manchester City\u2019s success. Whilst John Stones looked average at best, Nicholas Otamendi was catastrophically bad, giving the ball away several times in key areas and gifting Norwich a goal.\n\nLast year, City were able to win the league with their best midfielder, Kevin De Bruyne, absent for most of the season because they had good depth in that area. If this game is anything to go by, City will struggle to retain their title with Laporte out for up to six months because their centre-back depth is woefully inadequate.\n\n4. Norwich will be fun to watch\n\nOn the other hand, Norwich were great value for their win throughout the game \u2013 the 3-2 result was far from a smash and grab.\n\nDespite injuries which forced Daniel Farke to play Ibrahim Amadou out of position at centre-back, they took the game to the champions and were great to watch. Todd Cantwell and Teemu Pukki continued their burgeoning partnership, but it was Emi Buendia who looked a class above the rest. Whilst teams continue to work out how to stop them scoring, Norwich are sure to be very entertaining.\n\n5. Spurs\u2019 Belgian duo are still elite\n\nTottenham kept their first clean sheet of the season, and it is no surprise that Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen were at the heart of their defence.\n\nMauricio Pochettino had dropped Vertonghen for the opening three matches with Davinson Sanchez preferred, but he has not sufficiently eradicated the errors from his game since joining from Ajax in 2017. Whilst Alderweireld and Vertonghen are 30 and 32 respectively, they remain Spurs best defenders by a distance and two of the best in the league.\n\n6. Eddie Howe knows his stuff\n\nEddie Howe is one of the most tactically flexible coaches in the league. Since their arrival in the league in 2015, we have seen them employ a variety of formations across an entire season, with players often seemingly playing out of position.\n\nOn Saturday against Everton, they lined up in an attacking 4-4-2 with Josh King and Harry Wilson as wingers, with Lewis Cook making a return from injury after nine months out \u2013 and it worked. Cook was fantastic in the middle, and Josh King was problematic throughout. Everton had no answer and slipped to a 3-1 defeat.\n\n7. Liverpool lack depth\n\nLiverpool, after conceding a shock goal, were impressive against Newcastle, with Sadio Mane, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino all playing very well.\n\nHowever, they really only looked like title challengers once Firmino came on for the injured Divock Origi. The Brazilian was his usual delightful self and provided two assists, and also allowed Mane to move back to his favoured left flank.\n\nAlthough the result was positive, the fact that Liverpool are so heavily reliant on their front three is worrying given their incomparable squad players.\n\n8. Deulofeu key for Watford\n\nWatford\u2019s gameplan in the second half against Arsenal seemed to be \u2018give it Deulofeu and hope he does something good\u2019. Though the Spaniard did not score, and his assist was poking a Sokratis pass into the path of Tom Cleverley, he was impressive against the Gunners.\n\nThe result, alongside the performance, should give Watford hope for the remainder of the season, and it seems clear that a lot will rest on the shoulders of Deulofeu, who remains a very talented player despite not quite living up to the potential he showed whilst at Barcelona.\n\n9. The \u2018top 6\u2019 still exists \u2013 just\n\nWolves, Leicester and Everton were earmarked as the three most likely to break into the top six in the Premier League, yet all faltered this weekend. Wolves embarrassingly lost 5-2 at home to Chelsea, supposedly the weakest of last season\u2019s top six, whilst Leicester struggled against an injury-plagued Man United, and Everton lost 3-1 to Bournemouth, who finished 14th last season.\n\nThe gap between the top six and the rest appears to still be in place, with the only hope for the likes of Wolves, Leicester and Everton being Arsenal\u2019s poor results and performances at the start of the season, leaving them 7th and Leicester 5th.\n\n10. The Premier League is great\n\nThe Premier League is great because in any given match, anyone can beat anyone if the stars align. Few would have predicted that Norwich would stun City, or that Chelsea would score five at Wolves with an Englishman scoring a hattrick, or that Liverpool and City would have three clean sheets in their ten games. The unpredictability, along with the talent, is why many argue it is the best league in the world.\n\nWeekends like this remind us why we love the Premier League.", "description": "Manchester City were the victims of the biggest shock of the season thus far, as they succumbed to a 3-2 defeat to Norwich City\u00a0at Carrow Road.
