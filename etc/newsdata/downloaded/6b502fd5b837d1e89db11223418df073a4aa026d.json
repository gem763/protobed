You can also do this from your iPhone or from your Mac computer.\n\nHere's how to do it on your iPad.\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nHow to change the AutoFill settings on your iPad\n\n1. Open the Settings app on your iPad.\n\n2. Scroll down and tap \"Passwords & Accounts\" in the fifth section of options. This will bring you to your password details.\n\n3.

The gray number on the right-hand side shows how many entries have already been saved using AutoFill.\n\n5.

Tap \"Change Password on Website\" to bring you to its webpage on Safari.\n\n10.

Most passwords are only linked to one website, but some \u2014 like university logins \u2014 may connect to multiple, similar pages.\n\nThe details page for a saved password will show you what sites it's associated with.
