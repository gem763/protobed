Rejecting additional compensation \"just does not happen in our industry,\" said Williams.\n\nBennett said he consulted with his wife, Laurel, before making the decision. \"She's always said, 'Is there something we can do that can make a difference?' That's been on her heart and mind, and we've talked about it a lot,\" he said.", "description": "University of Virginia men's basketball coach Tony Bennett led the Cavaliers to their first appearance in the Final Four in 35 years and their first NCAA championship title in program history.
