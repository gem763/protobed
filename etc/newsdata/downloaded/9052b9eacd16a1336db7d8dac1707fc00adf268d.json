Which has now affected most of her body.\n\n\"Sharon now finds herself in a position where, despite her illness, she is having to work additional hours to pay cover all her bills while she is off work undergoing treatment.\n\n\"She has already used up all her holidays and is not entitled to sick pay due to her not being in her current employment long enough, so any time she needs to take off is now unpaid.\"\n\nMiss Coups said her two sons Conor, 26, and Aaron, 20, had been supportive throughout the diagnosis and treatment.\n\n(Image: nottinghampost.com/)\n\nShe said she wanted to raise awareness of the disease to help others.\n\nShe added: \"The diagnosis was devastating. I was in shock when I was told but I am being very positive about it. If I am negative then the cancer has won and I won't let that happen.\"\n\nYou can donate to the fundraising page here.", "description": "Sharon Coups, 50, took a trip to Specsavers when her right eye became irritated but she had no idea how serious the issue was", "authors": ["Hannah Mitchell", "Image", "Nottinghampost.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20736600.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_271019Slug_2531JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
