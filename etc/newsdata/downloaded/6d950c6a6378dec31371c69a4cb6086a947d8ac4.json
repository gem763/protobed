IFC, TLcom Capital, and Creadev joined Goldman on the VC side.\n\nTwiga will use the funds to set up a distribution center in Nairobi and deepen its conversion to offering supply chain services for both agricultural and FMCG products.\n\nThe Nairobi based company will invest in expanding into more cities in Kenya, including Mombasa. Twiga is also targeting Pan-African expansion by third quarter 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on French West Africa\u2026we see significant opportunity in those markets,\u201d Twiga CEO Peter Njonjo told TechCrunch. The company will name the new country (or countries) in the following year, he added.\n\nGoldman Sachs confirmed to TechCrunch its lead on Twiga\u2019s Series B funding. The U.S. based finance firm has backed several African startups, including e-commerce venture Jumia and South African fintech startup Jumo.\n\nTwiga\u2019s financing comes 11 months after a $10 million raise and announcement it would create additional revenue streams by moving into B2B supply chain for FMCG and other consumer products.\n\nPrior to this, Twiga focused primarily on agricultural goods and connecting the product of farmers more efficiently to marketplaces.\n\nThe venture has moved quickly on diversifying its supply-chain product mix. \u201cWe\u2019re not just doing fruits and vegetables\u2026I\u2019d say we\u2019re at 50/50 now between FMCG and fresh,\u201d said Njonjo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve pivoted a bit as a company\u2026we see our purpose as an organization around what I would call aggregating the informal retail, then using technology, and then using that buying power to essentially provide lower, better cost goods across cities,\u201d he said.\n\nCo-founded in Nairobi in 2014 by Njonjo and Grant Brooke, Twiga Foods serves around 3,000 outlets a day with produce through a network of 17,000 farmers and 8,000 vendors. Parties can coordinate goods exchanges via mobile app using M-Pesa mobile money for payment.\n\nThe company has reduced typical post-harvest losses in Kenya from 30% to 4% for produce brought to market on the Twiga network, according to Njonjo.\n\nTransferring these gains from improved supply-chain to a wider variety of food products has upside for economies and and consumers, he believes.\n\n\u201c[If you] get farmers now producing at large scale and supplying into you, and manufacturers that don\u2019t need to invest in distribution systems, it has huge benefit,\u201d said Njonjo.\n\n\u201cThink about in some of these economies, if you\u2019re spending 55% of disposable income on food, if that number were to go down to 40% \u2014 because of\u2026gaining efficiency \u2014 what you\u2019ve done is to release 15% for consumers to spend for other things.\u201d\n\nAs TechCrunch reported in November, Twiga Foods\u2019 consistent volume and revenue flow from agricultural goods provides a foundation to add other product categories to its B2B network.\n\n\u201cIf we can build a business around fresh fruit and vegetables\u2026It\u2019s now much easier to lay things over that would have been very expensive to get to end retailers,\u201d Twiga co-founder Grant Brooke said.\n\nThis could put the startup in a position to enter or supply B2C e-commerce with more favorable margins than existing players, i.e., online retailer Jumia \u2014 with high fulfillment expenses.\n\nOn that prospect, \u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u201dre thinking about from a strategic standpoint,\u201d said CEO Njonjo.\n\nBut Twiga has factored for its advantages in the B2C e-commerce space. \u201cLet me put it this way, if you\u2019re able to serve Nairobi\u2019s 180,000 retailers, it means that the furthest customer would be less than 2 kilometers away from any shop. That\u2019s the power of building a B2C business on top of a B2B platform. So definitely, the potential is there,\u201d said Njonjo.\n\nThat leaves some room for conjecture that Twiga Foods could pivot toward supplying or entering online retail in Africa.\n\nFor now the company will focus on performance metrics around its current model.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sharing data around revenue and profitability. But\u2026over the next 12 months as we scale, our unit economics is front and center to ensure we\u2019re growing our margins faster than our costs,\u201d said Njonjo.", "description": "Kenya\u2019s Twiga Foods has raised a total of $30 million from lenders and investors led by Goldman Sachs.
