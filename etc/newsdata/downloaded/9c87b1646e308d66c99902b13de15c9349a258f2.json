An entity had been holding 50% to less than 80% of warrants in previous weeks.\n\n* \"It's a big question how much money they still have to keep buying nickel and what their banks think. Once nickel price drops too much, their banks are also in trouble,\" said a nickel analyst, referring to the dominant nickel holder of LME stocks.\n\n* PRICES: LME aluminium eased 0.1%, zinc fell 0.7%, lead was down 0.1% and tin dropped 0.5%. In Shanghai, aluminium fell 0.3%, zinc rose 0.4%, lead declined 0.4% and tin decreased 2.3%.\n\n* LEAD: Unexpected shortages of lead due to supply disruptions have helped prices of the car battery metal to outperform other metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc, but looming surpluses mean this trend is unlikely to persist.\n\n* CHINA SCRAP: China has issued a fifth batch of quotas for imports of recently restricted types of scrap metal, including another 57,365 tonnes of high-grade copper scrap, according to a notice from a unit of the environment ministry.\n\n* CHINA OUTPUT: China's September refined copper output rose by 11.6% year-on-year to 838,000 tonnes, the highest since December 2018, while September zinc output rose by 18.9% year-on-year to 548,000 tonnes, the highest since December 2017, official data showed.\n\n* For the top stories in metals and other news, click or\n\nPRICES\n\nThree month LME copper\n\nMost active ShFE copper\n\nThree month LME aluminium\n\nMost active ShFE aluminium\n\nThree month LME zinc\n\nMost active ShFE zinc\n\nThree month LME lead\n\nMost active ShFE lead\n\nThree month LME nickel\n\nMost active ShFE nickel\n\nThree month LME tin\n\nMost active ShFE tin\n\nARBS ($1 = 7.0679 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Mai Nguyen; Editing by Rashmi Aich and Subhranshu Sahu)", "description": "By Mai NguyenSINGAPORE, Oct 21 (Reuters) - London copper hit its highest  in a month on Monday as concerns over supply mounted amid  intensifying unrest in...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
