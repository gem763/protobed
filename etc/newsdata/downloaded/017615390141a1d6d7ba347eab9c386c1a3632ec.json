It was evident that money was moving in and out of UNII is ways that could not be directly related to earnings, regular or EOY distributions. We've had some discussions about this in the past. The first chart shows the monthly UNII data reported by PIMCO converted into months of income stored in UNII (Y axis).\n\nIn 2015 PDI had about 8 months of extra income stored in UNII, and made a large EOY distribution. In mid 2016 things got weird. PDI, PCI and some others showed a large jump in UNII, in excess of what could reasonably have been normal income in one month. Presumably, some holding was converted into distributable income. In 2017 UNII drifted down fairly steadily, going negative for a few funds, with PCI being particularly challenged. Things improved in 2018, with another big UNII jump in April followed by a steady increase and then an EOY special. This year, again in July there was a 'too' big jump in UNII. So it seems likely that the recent UNII jump reflects something other than normal income.\n\nIn years past, Dick tried to educate us on how the movement of money in and out of swaps etc. can convert unrealized gains to income, or pull income out of the UNII pool into such positions. It might be possible to look back over the holdings from the relevant timeframe and work out what happened, with time resolution limited by quarterly holdings reports with 2-3 month lags (possible for someone with the requisite knowledge - ie not me).\n\nOver at the Fido site Dick posted on the UNII jump in July and its possible linkage to the NAV drop. His point was that distributable income can be stored in NAV, and that paying attention to unrealized gains might be informative in this regard. It got me curious to take a more detailed look at how month to month change in NAV relate to the monthly PIMCO NII and UNII data. Here are the year to date for PCI:\n\n2019 ytd income distribution UNII NII excess / shortfall D UNII D NAV jan 0,11 0,164063 0,28 -0,054 -0,05 0,49 feb 0,11 0,164063 0,22 -0,054 -0,06 0,19 mar 0,19 0,164063 0,24 0,026 0,02 -0,06 apr 0,16 0,164063 0,24 -0,004 0,00 0,24 may 0,24 0,164063 0,32 0,076 0,08 -0,07 june 0,23 0,164063 0,39 0,066 0,07 0,39 july 0,39 0,174 0,57 0,216 0,18 -0,08\n\nAnd in chart form to make it easier to see the trends. Y axis is dollars; D UNII is month to month change in UNII; D NAV is month to month change in NAV (sorry the D shows as D below the chart).\n\nObservations:\n\nJanuary: NII (income, light blue) was less than the distribution (orange). The NII shortfall was approximately equal to the change in UNII. NAV gains were 3x the monthly distribution.\n\nFebruary: NII was less than the distribution. NII shortfall was approximately equal to the change in UNII (visible in the shorter grey UNII bar). Monthly NAV gains again exceeded the monthly distribution. Nothing special so far - the UNII cushion is still >1 monthly distribution and there were lots of NAV gains available to cover the income shortfall if needed.\n\nMarch: Now the fun starts. NII increased - and NAV was down by an amount similar to the jump in NII. There does not need to be a cause effect relationship here, but it is certainly possible that some NAV gains were realized into NII. (it goes without saying that NAV goes down or up for other reasons, but I\u2019ll say it anyway so you all don\u2019t have to).\n\nApril: Nothing noteworthy except that NII stays high, covering the distribution. Monthly NAV gains were in excess of the distribution.\n\nMay: NAV was down this month, and NII increased by a similar amount. Given that NII was already covering the distribution, this move presumably reflects repositioning for other reasons - that also happened to throw off excess NII.\n\nJune: Steady as she goes. NAV increased quite a bit.\n\nJuly: Repeat of May \u2013 NAV was down, but this time NII increased by considerably more than the change in NAV. Again, repositioning for reasons other than income shortfall. The fact that the NAV changes show up as income might indicate something about the source (to someone who understands how the different types of security are taxed).\n\nWe cannot know what is happening in real time, but the month to month look-back provides a glimpse of the active management behind the income generation potential of these funds. It doesn\u2019t reveal how they do it, just that they are doing it. Once again, these CEFs can't do what they do without risk. They are not for everyone, and you should know your own risk tolerance.\n\nPS: let's not revive the whole 'how they misjudged the rate curve discussion and how could they be so dumb as to own Argentina debt'. Whether they blew it big-time will become clear over the next few months, when we can look back to see if (1) they continue to generate the income and (2) whether they do so at the cost of capital preservation.", "description": "I've been tracking NII, UNII & distributions for some of the PIMCO CEFs for a few years to try to get a sense of whether earnings were showing signs of - 19590", "authors": ["Explorer", "Participant", "Follower", "Contributor"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/1558i6C39C32DD92BFC01?v=1.0"}
