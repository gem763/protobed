The PBOC allows the yuan to trade in a 2% range around a mid-point it fixes against the dollar each day.\n\nThe latest Aug. 29-Sept. 4 Reuters poll of nearly 60 strategists showed the yuan is expected to trade around 7.19 to the dollar in six months, over 0.5% weaker than Wednesday's 7.15, before readjusting to 7.16 in a year.\n\nThat marks the third month in a row where analysts have lowered their yuan outlook.\n\n\"For currency markets, the last month's tariff-inspired yuan fall is much more important than it would have been were China still a minor player in global trade,\" said Kit Juckes, FX strategist at Societe Generale (PA: ) in London. \"U.S. President Donald Trump will have to wait longer \u2013 perhaps a lot longer \u2013 before he gets the weaker dollar he craves.\"\n\nNearly two-thirds of analysts who answered an additional question said China would fight the U.S. trade war by depreciating the yuan further.\n\n\"There's a risk the U.S. retaliates to yuan weakness, or to other currencies falling as a result of the yuan weakening. More tariffs could see more yuan weakness and more risk President Trump reacts to that, too. Dominos can fall over,\" added Juckes.\n\nThe most pessimistic 12-month view, 7.75 per dollar in the latest and previous surveys taken after the yuan breached the 7 per dollar rate, is the weakest since polling began more than a decade ago for the currency. That suggests a clear bias toward a further downgrade.\n\nWhile a weaker yuan is good for the world's largest exporter of manufactured goods, a weaker currency is likely to be limited in its ability to cushion the blow from import taxes imposed by the United States.\n\n\"Weakening the yuan can't benefit exporters if the tariffs are so high that they lose the orders altogether,\" noted Tim Condon at ING in Singapore.\n\nTo counter the economic slump, the PBOC reformed its key interest rates last month, establishing the loan prime rate as its main policy rate, aimed at lowering real interest rates for companies as part of broader market reforms.\n\nAbout 70% of respondents who answered a separate question said China's decision to change its interest rate system was not a step toward allowing the yuan to trade more freely.\n\n(Polling by Anisha Sheth and Shaloo Srivastava; Editing by Sam Holmes)", "description": "Yuan to weaken further as U.S. and China dig in on trade war: Reuters poll", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8404S_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
