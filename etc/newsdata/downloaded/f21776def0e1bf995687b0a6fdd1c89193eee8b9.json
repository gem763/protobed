'As the parents of Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who was poisoned by the nerve agent, we fully agree that our family, as well as the families of the other victims, don't need this as a reminder. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey was contaminated with Novichok 'We are all still trying to come to terms with what happened last year. 'The BBC Panorama programme, broadcast last year, on the Salisbury nerve agent attack was informative and a well-balanced documentary. 'It's disappointing that they want to follow it up with a drama. The people of Salisbury deserve a break from this. 'The BBC producer's promise to 'focus on the extraordinary heroism with which ordinary people reacted to the crisis' is just an excuse to sensationalise an episode in our lives and in the lives of the people of Salisbury which is still very raw.'\n\nDS Bailey's parents Steve and Sue Bailey, from Sandleheath in the New Forest, Hampshire, revealing their memories of the incident were still 'very raw'.\n\n'This is inappropriately premature for the people of Salisbury and in particular for the victims and their families,' said the parents in a letter.\n\n'We are all still trying to come to terms with what happened last year.'\n\nBBC Drama boss Piers Wenger said: 'BBC Two plugs into contemporary issues and dilemmas of the modern world, and has a rich history of exploring true stories from different perspectives in a sensitive and considered way.\n\n'The poisonings in Salisbury shocked the nation and had a huge impact on an unsuspecting community.\n\n'This drama will capture the bravery, resilience and personal experience of the local people who faced a situation of unimaginable horror, so close to home.'\n\nDS Bailey had visited the Skripals' home after they were found slumped on a bench in the city centre.\n\nIn the hours that followed DS Bailey became gravely ill as medics faced a race against time to save him from the affects of the poison.\n\nThe police officer spent two weeks in hospital, while former Russian special forces colonel Mr Skripal and his daughter spent almost three months being treated there.\n\nIt was not until 15 days after the attack that detectives realised the Skripals and Nick Bailey had come into contact with Novichok when it was sprayed on the door handle of the former spy's home.\n\nAnd three months after the incident, as the cathedral city began to return to normal, locals Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess fell ill from novichok poisoning. Sturgess died while Rowley survived but has ongoing mental and physical health issues.\n\nThe drama will be written by former Panorama reporter Declan Lawn and producer and director Adam Patterson.\n\nThe pair promised the series, which is in development and set to air on BBC Two, would focus on the 'extraordinary heroism with which ordinary people reacted to the crisis'.\n\nWiltshire Police officer DS Bailey returned to duty in January this year, having revealed he had lost his house and cars in the subsequent decontamination.\n\nHe, his wife Sarah and their children also lost their possessions in the clean-up.\n\nThe English town of Salisbury is officially decontaminated, the government said Friday, March 1, 2019 almost a year after it was the scene of the nerve agent attack\n\nThe cast also includes Games of Thrones' Mark Addy, and MyAnna Buring who starred in a play about the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, A Very Expensive Poison.\n\nThe BBC did not disclose which roles the actors are playing.\n\nA date for the series' broadcast has not yet been revealed.", "description": "The BBC have begun filming at locations across  south-west England for a new three-part drama which looks at the 2018 Salisbury novichok poisonings.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/10/20172776-0-image-a-28_1571995278885.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
