Cackling along while the poor sod, whacked out of their tiny minds on general anaesthetics and pain meds brings me an endless amount of joy. And when the person in question is a high-tier celebrity like Taylor Swift? Well, that\u2019s just a god damned jackpot.\n\nTaylor Swift was on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon this week, and a part of the sit-down with the \u00fcber celeb \u2013 who as far as I understand it, curates her every move \u2013 involves a video of Taylor, post-op, weeping over picking the wrong banana out of a bunch.\n\nJimmy Fallon apparently surprises Swift with this footage (or does he? or is it all a pre-planned ruse??) which was supposedly shared with the Tonight Show team by Tay\u2019s mum.\n\nThe video depicts Taylor after lasik laser eye surgery, all bugged out and loopy on her post-op medication, trying to pull a single banana off a bunch. And then getting upset when she rips off the wrong one.\n\nIt smacks of that video of the kid who loses his mind after visiting the dentist. You know the one.\n\nAfter Mum tells her not to cry over the Wrong Narnie, not only because it\u2019s not worth spilling tears over but also because she\u2019s just had fucken eye surgery, the video cuts to Taylor trying to eat the banana in bed, which is more of an approach of \u2018put banana near mouth and dopily mash mouth.\u2019\n\nAt first I was like \u201cahh man it\u2019s so nice to see a human side of Taylor that\u2019s not intricately curated and meticulously scripted!\u201d but then my workmate Brad said that it\u2019s most likely orchestrated by Taylor, as everything of herself she presents to the public is, and he\u2019s not wrong. We\u2019re all simply cogs in the larger Taylor Swift machine.\n\nWhatever the case, the video is funny as shit. Check it out below and enjoy relating to Taylor Swift on a deep level. Because this is 110% me after having too many wines on a Saturday and getting emotional over my late-night snack.\n\nMy favourite line is Taylor, mid-banana munch, reassuring her mum that she\u2019s not falling asleep by saying \u201cI\u2019m not asleep, my mind is alive.\u201d\n\nBless you, Taylor Swift. And bless your doctor for giving you those heavy-duty painkillers.", "description": "While on The Tonight Show, Taylor Swift watched on in mild horror as Jimmy Fallon showed footage of her after laser eye surgery, crying over a banana.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/taylor-swift-banana-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
