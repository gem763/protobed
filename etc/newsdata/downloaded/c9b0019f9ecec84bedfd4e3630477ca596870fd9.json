Photo: Nick Wass/AP\n\nLast Friday, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, tweeted a message in support of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong and set off an international crisis for the NBA. One week later, the league has only managed to make the problem worse.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s immediate response to Morey\u2019s tweet, which included calling it \u201cregrettable\u201d and \u201coffensive,\u201d was widely criticized earlier in the week. The shameless genuflecting to the Chinese government was unbecoming of America\u2019s most progressive sports league. But, as Will Leitch wrote, speaking out against China stands to do much more damage to the bottom line of the league and its players than standing against injustices here at home.\n\nThe backlash to the NBA\u2019s initial response led commissioner Adam Silver to try again on Tuesday. He put out a more assertive statement sticking up for the right of those associated with the NBA to express \u201cdifferent viewpoints over different issues.\u201d He added: The \u201cNBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nSilver\u2019s statement, though, left out one group of people whose viewpoints the league and its affiliates apparently will try to regulate: the fans. And now that people know the NBA is uncomfortable with pro-Hong Kong messages, they\u2019re bringing them to the NBA.\n\nAt Tuesday night\u2019s exhibition game between the 76ers and the Guangzhou Loong Lions at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, two fans were kicked out for chanting \u201cFree Hong Kong.\u201d Earlier in the game they had posters with the same slogan confiscated. The NBA may not have had anything to do with the fans getting booted from the arena \u2014 the team does not handle security \u2014 but it had everything to do with their demonstration, one of them said.\n\n\u201cThe NBA doesn\u2019t want to talk about this,\u201d Sam Wachs, who was kicked out of the game with his wife, told Yahoo! \u201cThey want to sweep this under the rug and I want to make that difficult for them.\u201d\n\nWachs\u2019s story went viral Tuesday night and by Wednesday, he had inspired others. In Washington, D.C., Wizards fan Patrick Hedger says he was kicked out of the game for holding up a sign and yelling \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d after the Chinese national anthem.\n\nOther fans at the same game, which saw the Wizards also playing host to the Loong Lions, said their \u201cGoogle Uighurs\u201d signs was confiscated. Uighurs are the predominantly Muslim ethnic group that the Chinese government has subjected to forced labor in reeducation camps.\n\nOur \u201cGoogle Uyghurs\u201d sign has been confiscated. pic.twitter.com/fX4tF4oOxR \u2014 Jon Schweppe (@JonSchweppe) October 9, 2019\n\nThe Wizards have said the signs were removed in accordance with the arena\u2019s ban on political posters. The Sixers say the fans were removed from Tuesday\u2019s game because other fans complained. And the NBA has distanced itself from what\u2019s happening at its games. But after two consecutive nights of in-arena disruptions, this problem is probably not going away.\n\nAnd the NBA\u2019s handling of the situation is only making it worse. The Rockets stepped in it again Thursday when a CNN reporter tried to ask star players James Harden and Russell Westbrook about whether the events of this past week would make them hesitant to speak out about non-basketball issues in the future. A team representative immediately shut her down.\n\nWatch the moment CNN\u2019s Christina Macfarlane was quickly shut down by the Houston Rocket\u2019s media officer as she tried to ask a question about the NBA\u2019s ongoing standoff with China.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/FHrUhPYRbg pic.twitter.com/lPVcT8X7wy \u2014 CNN Sport (@cnnsport) October 10, 2019\n\nReporter Christina Macfarlane was previously able to get a question in to Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni about the issue, asking him if he had a message for Chinese fans disappointed in the NBA\u2019s handling of the controversy. His answer: \u201cIt\u2019s a tough situation, very difficult. Adam Silver speaks for the NBA, I work for the NBA, I go with Adam. Commissioner Silver will do the right thing.\u201d", "description": "By throwing out protesting fans and shutting down questions from reporters, the league is making sure the issue doesn\u2019t go away.", "authors": ["Adam K.
