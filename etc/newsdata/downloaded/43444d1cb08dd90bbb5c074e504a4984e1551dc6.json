(HKG:947) Fare As A Dividend Stock?", "language": "en", "text": "Is MOBI Development Co., Ltd. (HKG:947) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.\n\nA 2.2% yield is nothing to get excited about, but investors probably think the long payment history suggests MOBI Development has some staying power. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nSEHK:947 Historical Dividend Yield, October 22nd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 62% of MOBI Development's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. MOBI Development paid out 94% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. While MOBI Development's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, free cash flow is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to MOBI Development's ability to maintain its dividend.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on MOBI Development's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. MOBI Development has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was CN\u00a50.023 in 2009, compared to CN\u00a50.017 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 2.9% a year during that period. MOBI Development's dividend has been cut sharply at least once, so it hasn't fallen by 2.9% every year, but this is a decent approximation of the long term change.\n\nWe struggle to make a case for buying MOBI Development for its dividend, given that payments have shrunk over the past ten years.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. MOBI Development has grown its earnings per share at 3.8% per annum over the past five years. Growth of 3.8% is relatively anaemic growth, which we wonder about. When a business is not growing, it often makes more sense to pay higher dividends to shareholders rather than retain the cash with no way to utilise it.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is MOBI Development Co., Ltd.
