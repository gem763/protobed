However, alluvial production, which is usually operated by small firms, still contributes some of the country\u2019s gold.\n\nAlluvial or artisanal gold mining in Russia is usually small-scale, but is still conducted by officially registered firms which are supposed to abide by health and safety rules.\n\nKrasnoyarsk officials said in a statement that water released by the dam partially flooded two dormitories of the rotational camp in which 74 people lived, adding that 13 people were still missing.\n\nA Russian investigative committee said it had launched a criminal probe into violation of safety rules at the gold mining spot, while local authorities said the collapsed dam was not registered by official bodies.\n\nInterfax said the miners were part of Siberian privately-held Sibzoloto, which unites several artisanal mining teams.\n\nSibzoloto was not immediately available for comment.\n\nSibzoloto produced about 3 tonnes of gold in 2018, Sergei Kashuba, the head of Russia\u2019s Gold Industrialists\u2019 Union, a non-government producers\u2019 lobby group, told Reuters. Sibzoloto is not a member of the union, he added.\n\nRussia produced 314 tonnes of gold in 2018.", "description": "At least 15 gold miners were killed on Saturday when a dam collapsed, flooding an artisanal mining encampment in a remote part of Siberia, officials said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
