Before Mr. Torrini\u2019s hiring, the company\u2019s finances were overseen by its co-chief executives.\n\nCelonis, founded in Germany in 2011, was valued at $1 billion after a $50 million Series B funding round last year. With the funding, Celonis became a unicorn\u2014a privately held startup valued at $1 billion or more\u2014and brought its fundraising total to nearly $80 million.\n\nMr. Torrini, who is working out of Celonis\u2019s New York office, most recently was the CFO of privately held corporate-fitness company Gympass and, before that, held finance positions at Groupon Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. His experience working internationally at both public and private companies during periods of rapid growth was a key selling point, co-chief executive Alexander Rinke said in an interview.\n\nCelonis, which is based in both Munich and New York, has grown from 65 to 700 employees over the past three years, Mr. Rinke said. The company has 10 offices in the 30 countries it operates in.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an opportunity to continue to grow at the pace equal or faster to what we\u2019ve been growing so far,\u201d Mr. Torrini said in an interview. \u201cWe want to build a large global company, and everything else\u2014more offices or employees\u2014will just be a function of that.\u201d\n\nDespite the company\u2019s rapid hiring, the finance operation in the U.S. remained minimal. For years, co-CEO Bastian Nominacher largely led the finance team from Munich, where most of the members of the finance team were based.\n\nMr. Torrini plans to add financial support in the New York office, including several leadership positions such as corporate controller and head of financial planning and analysis. Mr. Torrini, whose background is in tech finance but not accounting, said he expects to rely on those planned new hires for technical accounting expertise.\n\nThe planned expansion of the finance team, which now totals around 40, is part of an aggressive growth strategy companywide, Mr. Rinke said.\n\nCelonis\u2019s customer base of about 650 companies includes giants such as General Electric Co. , General Motors Co. and Airbus SE, a spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cCIOs, CMOs and even CEOs increasingly recognize the importance of having a system to accelerate your operational performance,\u201d Mr. Rinke said. \u201cOur goal really is to solidify and capture the opportunity over the next two to three years in a very big way.\u201d\n\nMr. Rinke and Mr. Torrini declined to quantify Celonis\u2019s expansion goals or their expectations regarding additional funding. They also were noncommittal on whether or not the company plans to go public. Several other process-mining companies such as Lana Labs GmbH, Signavio GmbH and Minit j.s.a. are privately held.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to become a world-class company, and an IPO might be a mechanical step that is required in order to achieve that goal,\u201d Mr. Torrini said. \u201cOr it might not be.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "Software startup Celonis hired its first finance chief in an effort to build out its U.S. finance operation and continue expanding its customer base.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104943/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
