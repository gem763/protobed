Those convicted include most regional ministers at the time, the speaker of the regional parliament and the leaders of Catalonia\u2019s two biggest pro-independence civic groups.\n\nThe court found Oriol Junqueras, the then-Catalan vice president and the highest-ranking official to face court, guilty of sedition and misuse of public funds. He faces the longest prison term among the accused \u2014 13 years. He is also disqualified from public office for 13 years, starting from now.\n\nThe Supreme Court sentenced five of Junqueras' ministers to terms ranging from 10 to 12 years in prison, while it convicted three of them only of disobedience, which entails a fine and a disqualification from public office but no prison term.\n\nThe court sentenced Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez \u2014 the two civil leaders \u2014 to nine years in prison for sedition, and parliament Speaker Carme Forcadell to 11 years.\n\nThe panel of seven judges unanimously acquitted the accused of the more serious charge of rebellion \u2014 the penal code\u2019s term for a \"coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\" \u2014 which the public prosecutor had sought and can entail longer prison terms.\n\nMost of those who were convicted were arrested and jailed on remand after they organized and carried out an illegal referendum on secession, explicitly disobeyed court orders and went ahead to declare independence on October 27, 2017 \u2014 which no country in the world recognized.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, Catalonia\u2019s president at the time of the events, fled the country to avoid detention after the declaration of independence and since then has fought extradition from a base in Belgium.\n\nThe Catalan government, which remains in the control of pro-independence parties, as well as secessionist civic organizations, called for public street protests in recent days in anticipation of the ruling. Thousands are expected to take to the streets on Monday and over the following days.\n\n\u201cWe will be back stronger, more convinced and firmer than ever,\u201d Junqueras said in a tweet posted on his official account, a message apparently sent from prison after the sentence was announced on Monday. \u201cThank you everyone because we will always persevere, always!\u201d\n\nThe nearly 500-page ruling presents acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez with a difficult political challenge ahead of a repeat general election on November 10. The Socialist leader has warned he will defend constitutional order by all legal means necessary.", "description": "They were convicted of sedition, disobedience and misuse of public funds but acquitted of the more serious charge of rebellion.", "authors": ["Diego Torres"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175842850-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
