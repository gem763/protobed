It is completely false. In fact, I have never met the first respondent [Ngqulwana], nor have I ever spoken to him\n\nThis version is in direct contrast with Magashule\u2019s founding affidavit, in which he denies ever being involved in the formation of the ATM or even knowing Ngqulwana.\n\n\u201cThis allegation is without any factual basis. It is completely false. In fact, I have never met the first respondent [Ngqulwana], nor have I ever spoken to him,\u201d wrote Magashule.\n\nHe also argued that Ngqulwana \u201cproffered no evidence whatsoever to support the allegations he has made against me\u201d and requested that the high court declare all allegations as defamatory and false.\n\nMagashule added that his application was brought against his accuser in an attempt to vindicate the dragging of his name through the mud.\n\nSpeaking to City Press on Friday, Ngqulwana stood firm on his allegations, saying that \u201cpursuant to that discussion with Magashule, an amount of R141 000 was thereafter paid into our account for the benefit of our foundation, the African Transformation Foundation\u201d.\n\nExplaining why he understood that Magashule had facilitated the payment, Ngqulwana said the funds came through Dots Design Agency, which boasts, among other entities, the Free State, the department of sports and recreation, Emfuleni Local Municipality, the City of Tshwane and the Road Traffic Management Corporation as some of its current and former clientele.\n\n\u201cThe payment of R141 000 assisted with the costs of the formation and registration of the political party,\u201d he said.\n\nDescribing how Magashule came to be so instrumental in the formation of the ATM, Ngqulwana said: \u201cPlans to establish a political party/organisation gained traction after the 54th National Conference [of the ANC], following the election of ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa.\u201d\n\nRead: An ANC commission or squabble for control over ATM?\n\nHe said \u201cdiscussions in this regard started in December 2017 in KwaZulu-Natal at former president Jacob Zuma\u2019s residence\u201d, adding that he was part of the discussions.\n\n\u201cIn attendance were people who had supported Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (NDZ) \u2026 They considered her an option to lead the ANC.\u201d\n\nNgqulwana alleged that further discussions took place in East London, which were centred on \u201chow to protect those who saw themselves as NDZ supporters and were facing the possibility of losing positions under the new administration led by Ramaphosa.\n\n\u201cAmong those in attendance in that meeting was [Magashule],\u201d wrote Ngqulwana.", "description": "While Ace Magashule vehemently denies association with the African Transformation Movement, Buyisile Ngqulwana claims the ANC secretary-general was part of the founding cabal.", "authors": ["Juniour Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9260/b37786bd9c5a497db6911c21378de3ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
