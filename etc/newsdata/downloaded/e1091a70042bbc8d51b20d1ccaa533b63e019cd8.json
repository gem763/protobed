The stock tumbled on their market debut earlier this month.\n\nRide-hailing companies Uber Technologies (N: ) and Lyft Inc (O: ), which have no stated timetable for becoming profitable, have also struggled since going public earlier this year.\n\nFounded in 2012, Peloton sells indoor bicycles in packages requiring memberships to access live and on-demand classes from home.\n\nFor the year ended June 30, Peloton's revenue more than doubled to $915 million but net losses widened to $195.6 million from $47.9 million.\n\nThe stock is due to begin trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol \"PTON.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: ), J.P. Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ), Barclays (LON: ) are among the underwriters to the IPO.\n\n(This story has been refiled to add dropped name \"Peloton\" to first sentence.)", "description": "Peloton raises $1.2 billion after IPO prices at top of range", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8O2F8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
