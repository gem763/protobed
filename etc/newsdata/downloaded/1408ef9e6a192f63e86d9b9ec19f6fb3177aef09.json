It has also locked horns with India on Jammu and Kashmir on more than one occasion.\n\nAlso on rt.com Saudi Arabia to invest $100bn in India to strengthen ties & diversify own economy \u2013 envoy\n\nNow, Saudi Arabia looks the other way as India flexes its muscle in the troublesome northern state, promises to share intelligence to boost India's fight against Islamic terrorism, and grants observer status to India in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). In between, it has conferred Modi with Saudi Arabia's highest civilian honour, the King Adbulaziz Sash, for good measure.\n\nSaudi Arabia has, for some time now, been looking for new friends in the East. The disappointing response of the United States after half of the kingdom\u2019s oil production was knocked out by drone attacks last month, or when the West cornered Riyadh on the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, has only driven it into the arms of India, and of China.\n\nFor this second iteration of FII, France, Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands have pulled out, as has the US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin along with IMF head Christine Lagarde. The chief executives of JP Morgan, Siemens, Blackrock, etc., had all turned their backs and so did leading names in Western media. Most of them \u2013the likes of the Fox Network, CNN, the New York Times and Bloomberg Media\u2013 are bearing their grudge even this year. The personal wooing of Google, Apple and Amazon by prince Salman himself has, apparently, had no effect.\n\nAlso on rt.com Modi-Xi informal 'summit' to unfold in the shadow of Kashmir\n\nNow Saudi's Aramco is investing over $44 billion in India's massive Ratnagiri oil refinery in Maharashtra and it's close to buying a 50 per cent stake in a $4.6 billion petrochemicals plant in Gujarat, Modi's home constituency. A quarter of India's oil needs today are met by Saudi Arabia and that it may overtake China in its exploding energy demands by 2024 is a mouth-watering prospect. The Saudi Arabia of today doesn't want to export just oil alone, it has ambitions of being the leader in the refinery business, as its investments in Texas and Ratnagiri suggest.\n\nIndia is also achieving its strategic goals alongside trade with Saudi Arabia. Its economic heft makes it a very attractive proposition for the US, the Middle East, Russia and China. It\u2019s a great position to be in. It has a population of 200 million Muslims for a majority of whom Saudi Arabia remains the seat of Islam, as the holy cities of Mecca and Medina are within its borders.\n\nAlso on rt.com New India lauds Mahatma Gandhi on all but one important matter\n\nModi pulled off a great PR coup with India's biggest minority group when it persuaded Saudi Arabia to increase India\u2019s Haj pilgrimage quota to 200,000, the second highest of all pilgrim quotas this year. Over three million Indian workers constitute the largest labor force in the kingdom and send a sizeable annual remittance of $11 billion back home. Above all, Saudi Arabia and the entire Gulf that is so enamoured of India, acts as a great restraining hand over Pakistan.\n\nThe India of today fits perfectly into Saudi Arabia\u2019s project, called Vision 2030, which is to open up the Kingdom and diversify its economy. It's as good a time as any to harp on Arabia's ancient links with India, which dates back to the third millennium BC, and to offer reminders that Arab traders once held a monopoly on spice trade between India and Europe. Good times of-old have a way of refreshing pleasant memories between two long-lost friends.\n\n\n\nBy Ashish Shukla, a senior journalist and geopolitical analyst based in India, author of 'How United States Shot Humanity,\u2019 who also operates a website, NewsBred.\n\nLike this story?
