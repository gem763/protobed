Sources familiar with the negotiations said GM\u2019s union members, who are fighting for better pay and benefits in their new contracts, are expected to get raises and bonuses in the deal. (Wall Street Journal)\n\nTalking point: The strike, the biggest for GM since the 1970s, has had substantial impacts on the company and the auto sector. GM has lost more than US$2 billion due to the work stoppage. The company\u2019s Canadian arm temporarily laid off close to 3,000 workers with pay and closed its plants in Oshawa and Ingersoll, Ont. (The latter has since reopened.) GM hasn\u2019t said what long-term impact the strike will have on its business, which is already struggling in Canada. Last November, it cut more than 2,000 jobs at its Oshawa facility; workers at the manufacturer Nemak\u2019s Windsor plant, which predominantly makes parts for GM, are challenging the facility\u2019s planned closure.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
