Gregg Popovich praises NBA Commissioner\u2019s \u2018courageous\u2019 stance on China", "language": "en", "text": "As I pointed out the other day, Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich is one of the most outspoken people in the NBA. He routinely pops off about gun control, racism, President Trump and whatever else is on his mind. So it was curious that in the midst of all the controversy over the NBA\u2019s reaction to social media statements supporting freedom in Hong Kong, Popovich seemed to be quiet. Yesterday, Popovich came forward to praise the NBA Commissioner\u2019s \u201ccourageous\u201d stance. He also managed to get in a shot at President Trump:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a heck of a leader in that respect and very courageous,\u201d Popovich told reporters at the Spurs-Miami Heat preseason game Tuesday. \u201cCompared to what we\u2019ve had to live through the last three years, there\u2019s a big difference gap there leadership-wise and courage-wise.\u201d\u2026 \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for him to say,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cHe said that in an environment that is fraught with possible economic peril. He sides with the principles that we all hold dearly \u2014 or most of us did until the last three years \u2014 so I\u2019m thrilled with what he said. The courage and leadership displayed is off the charts by comparison. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard about all the questions the talking heads have for the last three years: What kind of country do we want to be? Who are we? Where do we want to go? That sort of thing. Adam said something that helps you understand what direction you need to go in rather than the cowardice of not being able to respond to something like the murder of Mr. (Jamal) Khashoggi. There are many, many incidents like that where leadership and courage mean nothing (and) it\u2019s all about personal aggrandizement.\u201d\n\nWhat an absolute dumpster fire this answer is. All the NBA Commissioner said what that he would not attempt to regulate, \u201cwhat players, employees and team owners say.\u201d That\u2019s good so far as it goes, but what about the underlying issue that kicked off this entire firestorm? As Guy Benson pointed out, Popovich doesn\u2019t say one word about China or freedom in Hong Kong in this little speech. He completely avoids the subject:\n\nPopovich praises *Commissioner Silver\u2019s* \u201ccourage\u201d to the hilt here, repeatedly contrasting him w/ Trump. Nothing in this clip on whether he agrees w/ Morey on Hong Kong, or has any thoughts at all on China\u2019s serial abuses. The real villain in his framing is POTUS, not Beijing. https://t.co/f3G96lIemO \u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) October 9, 2019\n\nAnd it\u2019s worth noting that Popovich\u2019s refusal to touch on the actual controversy didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Check out the responses on the NBA subreddit. Sample comment: \u201cYou can see how much courage Silver had by how Popovich didn\u2019t mention China once.\u201d\n\nAs for the comparison with the death of Jamal Khashoggi, I\u2019m under no illusions about what happened there. Popovich apparently believes President Trump should have responded more forcefully to Saudi Arabia after the murder, though he doesn\u2019t say how. Fair enough. But if the moral of the Khashoggi murder is that you need to bravely confront human rights abusers, why isn\u2019t Popovich showing us how it\u2019s done? Why doesn\u2019t he display some of the leadership he claims the president is lacking by calling for freedom in Hong Kong? Couldn\u2019t he at least say he support the comments made by Daryl Morey?\n\nPopovich is a hypocrite, just like fellow coach Steve Kerr who said he needed to phone a friend before he could decide whether freedom and respect for human rights are superior to communist dictatorship. Maybe if Kerr and Popovich get together for a long lunch they can think through this and get back to us with an answer. But don\u2019t hold your breath waiting for it to happen.\n\nJason Whitlock\u2019s nailed it in his appearance on Fox Sports yesterday. \u201cCut it out NBA, Adam Silver, Steve Kerr. You\u2019re not social justice activists. You\u2019re business people because when China tells you to shut the hell up, everybody shuts the hell up,\u201d Whitlock said. And Gregg Popovich just proved Whitlock right.", "description": "\"...when China tells you to shut the hell up, everybody shuts the hell up\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gregg-Popovich-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
