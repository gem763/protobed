I watched a lot of him growing up so I\u2019m just happy I get to play with him.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s hope I can learn some things off him and the rest of the players.\u2019\n\nAndre Russell was picked up by Southern Brave for \u00a3125k (Picture: Getty)\n\nRussell, meanwhile, said: \u2018I was nervous, the first time being in the draft of this new competition.\n\n\u2018The competition\u2019s got a lot to offer. The game has been evolving for the last couple of years so with 100 balls, it\u2019s definitely see ball, hit ball!\n\n\u2018If we can get some more good players to top it off, we\u2019ll have a balanced team and I think we can do it.\u2019\n\n(Picture: Sky Sports)\n\nExplaining his decision to sign Australia World Cup star Warner, Southern Brave coach Jayawardene said: \u2018I was surprised he was still available on our second pick.\n\n\u2018We had different plans but I thought he\u2019s played a lot of franchise cricket and has so much experience.
