Abigail Spanberger. | Win McNamee/Getty Images congress Why these Democrats want to make a trade deal with Trump With trade tensions continuing and 2020 looming, some House Democrats are growing antsy to see congressional action on the deal to replace NAFTA.\n\nBLACKSTONE, Va. \u2014 Rep. Abigail Spanberger squinted into the August sun as the farmer beside her laid out how his profits on corn and soybeans are sinking \u2014 and how he believes passing President Donald Trump\u2019s new North American trade agreement could help.\n\nSpanberger and other moderate freshman Democrats who flipped Republican districts to hand their party the majority in 2018 could be key to getting a vote on the U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement this year. And even though that would give Trump a policy victory heading into the 2020 election, members of this group are beginning to put increasing pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to bring the measure to the floor as they head back from a summer recess spent talking to impatient constituents.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not seeing progress, if we\u2019re not seeing the implementation documents by October, I think that\u2019s a serious, serious problem,\u201d Spanberger told POLITICO at the tail end of a two-day swing through her district\u2019s rural areas, where she heard from farmers pleading for relief from trade policies that have gutted their profits.\n\nThe issue will crystalize the divide between moderates in the Democratic caucus and progressives who are loath to give Trump a policy win when Congress returns to work in September. Pelosi has bought time by setting up a working group to negotiate possible changes to the agreement to replace NAFTA that the Trump administration struck with Canada and Mexico earlier this year. But Spanberger and others like her are growing increasingly eager to move forward.\n\nOnce the House reconvenes Sept. 9, lawmakers will have just 13 legislative days on Capitol Hill before taking another two-week break \u2014 meaning the next several weeks could prove crucial to the pact's fate.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Trump\u2019s spat with China and off-the-cuff tariff announcements are causing much of the anxiety over trade, but Canada and Mexico are now the United States' biggest trading partners, and locking in the new North American deal could go a long way toward boosting morale among exporters and importers and sparking new investments, supporters say.\n\n\u201cAny good trade deal, I want it passed,\u201d 34-year-old John Shepherd said as he and Spanberger stood on his Virginia farm between the cornfields and the grain bins storing the crop he\u2019s been unable to sell. The USMCA, he said, is \u201cbetter than what we\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nFor now, most Democrats, including Pelosi, maintain that the goal is to \u201cget to yes\u201d on the deal, but they still need to see stricter labor and environmental standards and changes to the language surrounding prescription drug pricing.\n\nBut some more moderate Democrats have already begun to speak out in favor of moving forward. Fourteen House Democrats sent a letter to Pelosi just before the summer recess urging continued discussions throughout August \u201cto ensure a vote on a bipartisan agreement by the end of this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s room to move, but we need to see it keep moving,\u201d said Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (D-Texas), a freshman who signed the letter. \u201cThe sooner we can work through these things and get to certainty, I think there\u2019s a real benefit to everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce we start getting into September and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel, that\u2019s going to cause a lot of concern for me,\u201d added Rep. Anthony Brindisi, a freshman who narrowly beat the Republican incumbent in his upstate New York district last year.\n\n\u201cIs this deal perfect? Absolutely not,\u201d Brindisi said in a phone interview. \u201cBut we have to move forward before we close off these markets.\u201d\n\nThe politics are tricky for Democrats. Even as some begin to push for a vote, scores of others are vowing to stay opposed until they see sweeping changes. The more than 90-member Congressional Progressive Caucus came out against the current version of the agreement in March, calling the pharmaceutical provisions in particular \u201cvery egregious.\u201d\n\nRep.

Mone/AP Photo\n\nSome Democrats are also asking for modifications to be written into the core text of the agreement \u2014 a tall order, especially given that Mexico has already approved the deal as written.\n\nAnd while Pelosi does not need her entire caucus to back the deal, she is highly unlikely to allow a vote until at least a broad swath of Democrats are on board, legislative aides and political strategists say.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need a majority of the majority,\u201d said John Michael Gonzalez, a former Democratic House staffer who is now a lobbyist at Peck Madigan Jones. \u201cShe could use anything between 80 to 100 votes.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have already sought to pin the blame for any delays squarely on the opposing party. The Senate GOP, for example, posted from its official Twitter account over the August recess calling House Democrats \u201cthe final hurdle delaying the benefits of this America-first trade agreement.\u201d\n\nAnd Vice President Mike Pence, who has been traveling the country touting the benefits of the deal, has pinpointed districts led by potentially vulnerable Democrats whom lobbying groups have targeted as possible yes votes. During a trip to central Utah last month in Rep. Ben McAdams\u2019 district, Pence appealed directly to the freshman Democrat, another one of the 40 who flipped his seat in 2018 to give his party the majority.\n\n\u201cCongressman McAdams, who\u2019s in the majority in the Congress today, I\u2019m going to ask you favor,\u201d the vice president said in South Jordan. \u201cWhen you get back to Washington, D.C., tell Speaker Pelosi to put the USMCA on the floor, and tell her that Utah and America need the USMCA this year.\u201d\n\nThe end of 2019 has become an informal deadline to get the deal approved amid concerns that it will get lost in the noise of the presidential election if it bleeds into 2020. But the campaign itself could add to pressure for action sometime over the fall, as Democrats seek to defend their House majority.\n\n\u201cThe strategic premise we\u2019re operating under is if you are a Democrat in a highly competitive district, you are looking for at least one bipartisan vote that you can point to to burnish your independent credentials,\u201d said Phil Cox, a longtime GOP operative who now co-chairs the bipartisan Trade Works for America coalition, which is pushing for passage of the USMCA.\n\nCox\u2019s group, which he co-leads with former Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, has pulled together a \u201ctarget list\u201d of nearly 100 members, mostly Democrats, who could be persuaded to support the deal largely because their seats are highly competitive and a vote in favor could help win over constituents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very helpful to be able to say, look, I didn\u2019t agree with the president of the other party, I may not like him, but when there were issues that I thought were good for workers and small business and farmers in my district, I crossed the aisle and supported it,\u201d Cox said.\n\nTheir message, in many areas, is starting to break through.\n\n\u201cWe have to get to a place where we have certainty through trade agreements,\u201d Spanberger told POLITICO. \u201cUSMCA as it\u2019s in its current form would be really good for dairy farmers. It would be good for a lot of our agricultural communities. It\u2019s good for labor.\u201d", "description": "With trade tensions continuing and 2020 looming, some House Democrats are growing antsy to see congressional action on the deal to replace NAFTA.", "authors": ["Megan Cassella"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bc/48/f43712e6440b9a7b614f19e653bf/190830-abigail-spanberger-gty-773.jpg"}
