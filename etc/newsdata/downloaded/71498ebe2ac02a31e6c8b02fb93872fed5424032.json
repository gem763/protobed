It is a great story to say there is contention between players. If he scores it is not a story. But he took it and missed. That is it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There is no issue in the dressing room.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse for Chelsea, fellow rookie Mason Mount then received a painful introduction to Europe when former Arsenal midfielder Frances Coquelin left his studs on the inside of the youngster\u2019s shin.\n\nIt was a nasty challenge which only earned Coquelin a yellow card, but after trying to play on Mount\u2019s match came to a premature end after 14 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt did affect the game and we know how well he is playing. He looked sharp,\u201d Lampard said of losing Mount.\n\n\u201cIt is an ankle injury and hopefully not too bad. It needs to be assessed over the next few days.\u201d", "description": "Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has insisted there is \u201cno issue in the dressing room\u201d after Ross Barkley demanded to take the club\u2019s late penalty against Valencia in the Champions League on Tuesday night, only to hit the crossbar.
