The 2018 prize was not awarded last year amid a scandal at the academy.\n\nAD\n\nThe judges praised Handke for his vast production in different genres, including essays, short prose, plays and films, and noted that he has become \u201cone of the most influential writers of contemporary fiction\u201d since his 1966 debut novel, \u201cThe Hornets.\u201d His most widely read work is \u201cA Sorrow Beyond Dreams,\u201d about his mother\u2019s suicide in 1971. The Nobel committee called out for special praise for \u201cDie Obstdiebin\u201d (\u201cThe Fruit Thief\u201d) published in 2017, for its acute awareness of the landscape and its nomadic theme. \u201cWith great artistry, he explores the periphery and the unseen places,\u201d the judges said.\n\nAD\n\nFor some, Handke\u2019s win has been a long time coming. When Elfriede Jelinek won the Nobel in 2004, she told the New York Times, \u201cI was convinced that, if Austria was to get it, it would go to Peter Handke, and rightly so.\u201d But Handke\u2019s win today is not without controversy. The committee, so eager to move beyond its recent scandals, may have just stumbled into another one. Handke has been widely accused of being an apologist for fascists and Serbian nationalism. Such influential writers as Salman Rushdie have noted with alarm Handke\u2019s coziness with the worst elements in Serbia. Handke was condemned for speaking at the 2006 funeral of Slobodan Milosevic and suggesting that the West had misunderstood the leader, who was accused of war crimes.\n\nKosovo\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Vlora Citaku, immediately condemned the Nobel Prize for Handke, saying it was a \u201cpreposterous and shameful decision.\u201d Citaku tweeted: \u201cSCANDALOUS! #Nobel committee decides to award Peter Handke \u2014 a man who glorified Milosevic aka \u2018The Butcher of The Balkans\u2019 & supported his genocidal regime \u2014 this year\u2019s prize in literature. There is nothing nobel about this!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHandke\u2019s works have received mixed reviews in the United States. In 1985, a Washington Post reviewer described \u201cSlow Homecoming\u201d as \u201cstupendously dull . . . clotted, undramatic, entirely self-obsessed.\u201d A Post review in 1984 claimed that Handke was the best representative of those avant-garde German writers who are \u201csolemn, strenuously intellectual, and glumly determined not to entertain.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut in 1998, Post reviewer Thomas McGonigle praised \u201cMy Year in the No-Man\u2019s Bay\u201d and noted that \u201ca new note of an acceptance of complex reality has gradually come to the fore in Handke\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nHandke\u2019s film work has expanded his audience considerably. In 1987, he co-wrote the award-winning movie \u201cWings of Desire,\u201d directed by Wim Wenders. A review in The Post praised Wenders and Handke for creating \u201ca whimsical realm of myth and philosophical pretense, dense with imagery.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe judges read a statement saying that Tokarczuk is \u201ca writer preoccupied with local life but at the same time inspired by maps and speculative thought, looking at life on Earth from above. Her work is full of wit and cunning.\u201d The committee also singled out for special commendation Tokarczuk\u2019s 1,000-page historical novel, \u201cThe Books of Jacob,\u201d about an 18th-century sectarian leader. Riverhead Books plans to publish the novel in English in 2021.\n\nAD\n\nHearing the news, Tokarczuk\u2019s U.S. editor, Rebecca Saletan, at Riverhead, said: \u201cIt has been an indescribable joy to immerse myself in working with Olga Tokarczuk. Her serene devotion to her work, her playfulness, her generous acknowledgment of her translators and all those who bring her books before the world, and her infectious joy as that happens make the outward persona of this remarkable writer a mirror to one of the most fertile imaginations of our time.\u201d\n\nTokarczuk\u2019s U.S. translator, Jennifer Croft, said: \u201cOne of the things that sets her apart from a lot of other Nobel Prize winners is that she is simultaneously critically acclaimed and beloved \u2014 overwhelmingly beloved by the public. She is an extremely ambitious writer who is also incredibly accessible. And her background as a psychologist lends her characters so much psychological nuance.\u201d Croft also praised Tokarczuk\u2019s \u201cbeautifully lyrical\u201d prose. \u201cIt has a kind of reassuring rhyme,\u201d she said. \u201cShe can write about really ghastly things and confront terrible truths about history, and yet the reader still feels comforted by the prose itself.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTokarczuk\u2019s novel \u201cFlights\u201d (translated by Croft) won the 2018 Man Booker International Prize for translated fiction. Reviewing the novel in The Post, Tom McAllister wrote: \u201cIt moves briskly, buoyed by a sense of humor that is sometimes dark but often joyful. . . . It\u2019s one of the novel\u2019s great strengths that Tokarczuk can keep you turning the pages even as you\u2019re not entirely sure what she\u2019s getting at, or how it all fits together.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe unprecedented decision to confer two prizes today was expected, because the Swedish Academy announced in May 2018 that it would postpone the 2018 literature prize until this year.\n\nThat decision was made in the wake of a scandal that had embroiled the academy and threatened the future of the world\u2019s most prestigious literary award. The controversy erupted in late 2017 when news broke that French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a member of the academy, had been accused of multiple instances of sexual assault and harassment over a period of many years. Arnault and his wife were also accused of misusing academy funds and even leaking the names of prizewinners for profit.\n\nAD\n\nIn the internecine battle that followed, Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the academy, was forced out of her position over her handling of an investigation into Arnault\u2019s behavior. Several other members resigned or refused to participate on the Nobel committee.\n\nAD\n\nArnault was subsequently found guilty of rape, fined and sentenced to more than two years in prison.\n\nCritics around the world called for more transparency to help rebuild the prize\u2019s reputation. Delaying the 2018 prize until this year was intended to provide time for necessary housekeeping. The academy has since removed members with conflicts of interest, added new members and appointed Mats Malm as the new permanent secretary. In March, the Nobel Foundation, which funds the prize, issued a news release saying that \u201cthe steps that the Swedish Academy has taken and intends to take will create good opportunities for restoring trust in the Academy as a prize-awarding institution.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHonoring two authors in one year is unusual for the Nobel Prize in literature, but it is not unprecedented. It has happened four times in the past, most recently in 1974 when the Swedish writers Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson won. The difference this year is that Handke and Tokarczuk are not sharing the prize; they\u2019re each getting their own and about $910,000 apiece.\n\nThe last person to win the Nobel Prize in literature was British novelist Kazuo Ishiguro in 2017.\n\nThe only living U.S. winner of the Nobel Prize in literature is the musician Bob Dylan, who received the award in 2016.\n\nThe winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.\n\nAD", "description": "The decision to confer two prizes was expected, since the Swedish Academy announced last year that it would postpone the 2018 literature prize until this year.", "authors": ["Ron Charles", "Critic", "Book World"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YltsMbROiGjP12E3tHqov-ebptU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WEHCS2XLJYI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
