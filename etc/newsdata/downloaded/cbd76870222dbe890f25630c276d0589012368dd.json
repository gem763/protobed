The parties invited to the talks are almost entirely Marxist \u2014 some to the left of Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) \u2014 and do not represent any significant percentage of the Venezuelan population. President Juan Guaid\u00f3, legally the head of state of the country despite Maduro refusing to hand over military power, is not participating in the talks.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 is a member of the Popular Will party, an official member party of the Socialist International. Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) considers the Socialist International a right-wing institution for condemning the gross human rights abuses his regime regularly commits.\n\nThe \u201copposition\u201d engaged in the talks has spread rumors that the regime may begin freeing some of the hundreds of political prisoners it is keeping as part of a deal with them. Maduro denies holding any prisoners of conscience and has arrested journalists, including Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos, for discussing the torture and imprisonment of political dissidents.\n\nMaduro\u2019s regime abruptly freed Guaid\u00f3\u2019s second-in-command, First Vice President of the National Assembly Edgar Zambrano, on Tuesday, after four months of incarceration without being presented with any evidence he had committed a crime. Secret police agents towed Zambrano to prison in May after he refused to get out of his car but never presented him with any particular charges.\n\nZambrano used his freedom to immediately call for the liberation of all political prisoners, and reports began to circulate that Maduro may trade prisoners for some international goodwill.\n\nThe Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional reported on Thursday that parties to the talks with Maduro \u2014 which include groups such as \u201cMovement Towards Socialism\u201d and the \u201cProgressive Alliance\u201d \u2014 were screening prisoners on Wednesday at the Helicoide, a former shopping-mall-to-be turned into a prison for political dissidents and the headquarters of the Bolivarian Intelligence Agency (SEBIN). The newspaper claimed the politicians were interviewing prisoners and met with 20 individuals who were \u201ccandidates\u201d for release as part of a deal between the leftist parties and Maduro. As many as 60 individuals could be conditionally released under house arrest or probation, the report added.\n\nAlfredo Romero, the director of the Venezuelan Penal Forum, warned that the information currently available does not guarantee that the individuals released, if any, will be prisoners of conscience.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday to Venezuelan outlet Uni\u00f3n Radio, Romero said that Maduro\u2019s regime \u201cregularly includes in its group of freed suspected political prisoners some who are not [political prisoners], but common criminals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese liberations are a form of extortion and intimidation,\u201d Romero warned, suggesting that the Maduro regime would rapidly fill the empty cells, some that once held criminals, with political dissidents. \u201cAll this is just a show to benefit some factions who want to win some sort of medal.\u201d\n\nMaduro\u2019s regime is heavily engaged in cocaine trafficking and allied with terrorist organizations like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Hezbollah. It also often employs violent criminals to intimidate political dissidents and attack them, forming violent gangs called colectivos.\n\nRomero noted on a separate program on Venezuela\u2019s NTN24 that, even in the event that the number of political prisoners discussed would be freed, they would be a minuscule number of the people being tortured in political prisons nationwide. The Venezuelan Penal Forum has certified the existence of 477 political prisoners in the country as of this week.\n\n\u201cIf they free, let\u2019s say, 40 people, that would represent ten percent, less than ten percent, of the 477 political prisoners still behind bars. So the first problem is that a group of political prisoners under the same unjust and political circumstances of arrest will be left forgotten, trapped,\u201d said Romero. \u201cAnd the second point is that the revolving door gets greased up \u2014 while they free people, they imprison even more of them.\u201d\n\nAlfredo Romero: liberar 40 presos pol\u00edticos en Venezuela no representar\u00eda ni el 10% de los que est\u00e1n tras las rejas https://t.co/G90bql3CWL pic.twitter.com/qVxet3j1uo \u2014 NTN24 (@NTN24) September 18, 2019\n\nMaduro has repeatedly denied the existence of political prisoners in the country. In a dramatic moment for Maduro, he arrested Ramos and his team while in Caracas in February after Ramos asked him about the prisoners. Maduro denied their existence, so Ramos handed him a list with the hundreds of names of individuals detained for opposing socialism. Ramos also showed Maduro a video of Venezuelans eating out of a garbage truck, asking him why he had implemented policies that were starving his people.\n\nMaduro reportedly \u201cdidn\u2019t like\u201d the interview, confiscated it, and arrested the team. Univision acquired the lost video footage in May through contacts in the Venezuelan government that confirmed Ramos\u2019s version of events and showed Maduro flatly denying the existence of prisoners of conscience.\n\n\u201cTake your little garbage and take it away, comrade,\u201d Maduro said, swatting away the list of prisoners.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The Venezuelan Penal Forum warned that dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro may sneak common criminals into any agreement to free his political enemies.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/maduro-venezuela-political-opposition-consolidated-power-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
