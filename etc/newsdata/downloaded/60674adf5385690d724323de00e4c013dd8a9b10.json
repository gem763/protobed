This week, TV and film critic John Semley and arts and culture critic Lara Zarum join host Tom Power to talk about the evil clown craze that's sweeping some of the latest film releases.\n\nFrom Joker to IT: Chapter 2, the panel discuss what it is about clowns that make them a staple horror movie archetype, the controversy that surrounds these films and if stories about the anti-hero still resonate in the same way.\n\nThey look at Joaquin Phoenix as the title character in Joker in the new and extremely dark origin story about Batman's chief nemesis. Joker premiered at the Venice Film Festival last week and will be at the Toronto International Film Festival this week. The panel talks about the Oscar buzz surrounding the performance and what makes this Joker different.\n\nActor Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd arrives for the world premiere of It Chapter Two.
