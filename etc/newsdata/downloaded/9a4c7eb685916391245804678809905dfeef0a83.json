There is NO WAY these can be legitimate transactions? As lawyers & others have stated, as President, I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probable, CORRUPTION! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2019\n\nJoe Biden has been vehemently denying any of the posts held by his son were in any way illegal, while also claiming they did not discuss his business in Ukraine while serving as the Vice President. This did not convince Trump in the slightest.\n\n\u201cThe Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable. Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter,\u201d he said in a separate tweet, before dismissing his likely 2020 election rival as \u201c1% Joe Biden,\u201d and even advising him to \u201chang it up.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Trump says China and Ukraine should investigate the Bidens' activities in the countries\n\nEven if lengthy and vicious, Trump\u2019s latest thrust at the Bidens fades before the sheer scale of the Democratic efforts trying to \u201cimpeach the 45th.\u201d The latest such attempt involves accusing Trump of meddling into Ukraine\u2019s affairs (a shocking feat certainly never attempted by the White House before) \u2013 all in an effort to, allegedly, pressure Kiev into digging up dirt on his opponent.\n\nWhile Trump did ask the Ukrainian president to cooperate with AG William Barr while looking into the Biden\u2019s suspicious dealings, he strongly denies there was any \u201cquid pro quo\u201d or pressure involved.\n\nMeanwhile, a second anonymous \u201cwhistleblower\u201d emerged on Sunday with a supposedly damning account of Trump\u2019s Ukraine affair, and this time instead of hearsay he\u2019s rumored to have a \u201cfirst-hand knowledge\u201d of the matter. Whether it provides actual material for launching an impeachment procedure the Democrats dream of, or if the \u2018Ukrainegate\u2019 flops like the infamous \u2018Russiagate\u2019 has, remains to be seen.\n\nAlso on rt.com 2nd whistleblower \u2018comes forward\u2019 with more Ukrainegate \u2018proof\u2019 in Trump impeachment saga \u2013 report\n\nLike this story?
