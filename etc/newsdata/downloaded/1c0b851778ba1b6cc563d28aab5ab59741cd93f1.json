Folt began with a procession of hundreds through Alumni Memorial Park, with its lush green hedges and broad shade trees surrounding the Youth Triumphant fountain.\n\nAcademic gowns. Flags and banners. The USC Trojan Band played for 45 minutes straight. \u201cFight On\u201d and on and on.\n\nThe ceremony Friday lasted about two hours on a typically beautiful day in Los Angeles. It was both celebratory and somber. USC has a new president because the school has way bigger issues tearing at its reputation and credibility than its football team\u2019s struggles under coach Clay Helton.\n\n\u201cI will see you at the Coliseum and we will have a great victory tonight,\u201d said Rick Caruso, the billionaire businessman and chairman of USC\u2019s board of trustees, as he concluded the affair. \u201cFight on!\u201d\n\nHelton\u2019s team did just that, bouncing back from an overtime loss the week before at BYU to beat a Utah team considered one of the best in the Pac-12. And the Trojans (3-1) did it with Urban Meyer, the currently retired coaching great who many USC fans would like to see replace Helton, in the building.\n\n\u201cSC got heart!\u201d defensive back C.J Pollard yelled as he swaggered back to the locker room under the Los Angeles Coliseum. \u201cWe beat the 10th ranked team with a third-string quarterback. SC got heart!\u201d\n\nEvery week is a referendum on Helton, the fourth-year coach who has brought peace and professionalism to a program that has been lacking in those areas for about a decade. But he has not won enough by USC\u2019s lofty standards. So Helton\u2019s future as coach of the 21st-ranked Trojans is murky at best. The school is searching for a new athletic director, whose first major task could be to hire a football coach at USC for the fourth time in the last 10 years.\n\n\u201cI think this is a mentally tough bunch,\u201d Helton said Friday night of his team. \u201cAnd I know some folks have made fun of me for \u2018So what, now what?\u2019 But that\u2019s our motto. Stuff is bad sometimes, but it is: \u2018What are you going do to? Are you going to make an excuse or are you going to find a way to get the job done?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe job facing Folt, the former University of North Carolina president, is far more daunting than Helton\u2018s. Over the last year, USC has been embroiled in multiple scandals, including a criminal sexual assault case involving allegations against a school doctor and the college admissions fiasco in which parents were bribing their children\u2019s way into the college through phony athletic profiles.\n\n\u201cThese are problems that have harmed our reputation and have taken a real toll on the Trojan community,\u201d Folt said during her speech. \u201cI want to assure you we will tackle these problems until they are corrected.\u201d\n\nIt is impossible to know how much influence Folk will have in deciding what happens with Helton. Before her inauguration, she shot down rumors about attending a dinner with Meyer, who was in town for his job on Fox\u2019s new pregame show. \u201cBig Noon Kickoff\u201d did a special episode from the field at the Coliseum on Friday night, adding another storyline to one of the most eventful days in recent USC history.\n\nFans clustered in the end zone stands facing the Fox set before the game to get a glimpse of Meyer, but he wasn\u2019t even the main attraction. Former USC star Reggie Bush was attending a Trojans game for the first time since the school was forced to disassociate with the 2005 Heisman Trophy winner as punishment for NCAA rules violations during the football program\u2019s most recent dynasty.\n\nBush was serenaded by fans with chants of \u201cReg-gie!\u201d and \u201cFree Reggie\u201d throughout the night. USC running back Markese Stepp handed Bush the ball after scoring a fourth-quarter touchdown. That drew a 15-yard penalty.\n\nAs for Meyer, there were brief \u201cHire Urban\u201d chants from the fans.\n\nAbout that: First off, it is plausible in a Pac-12 that is far from fierce, the Trojans could rattle off enough victories to make it near impossible for USC to justify firing Helton and paying a buyout speculated to be about $18 million.\n\nSecondly, considering Meyer was suspended by Ohio State last year for three games for giving too much slack to an assistant coach who was accused of domestic violence, is that a hire USC and Folt would be willing to make?\n\nDuring Caruso\u2019s introduction of Folt, he said: \u201cWe are here knowing something has been lost. We\u2019re here to get it back.\u201d\n\nWhat USC has lost is its integrity. But by all accounts, that\u2019s not a problem with its football coach.\n\nOn Friday night, after starting quarterback Kedon Slovis was knocked out of the game on USC\u2019s second play, Matt Fink stepped in and lit up one of the Pac-12\u2019s best defenses. Fink is a fourth-year junior who was buried on the depth chart after spring practice.\n\nSo, of course, he looked to transfer. As a graduate he could have played right away for a new school. Not only did Fink enter the NCAA\u2019s transfer portal so schools could recruit him, he took an official visit to Illinois. He did so with Helton\u2019s blessing and an open door to return.\n\n\u201cI said: \u2018Matty, if you choose to leave, I love you and I support you. But I want you to know the door is always open here,\u2019\u201d Helton said Friday night. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m not totally sold that it\u2019s the right decision. But it\u2019s a decision that you\u2019ve got to make personally.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter the game, as Helton was making his way off the field, he and Meyer caught eyes from afar. They pointed to each other and Meyer appeared to say, \u201cGood job.\u201d\n\nIt would be hard to argue Helton is a coach in Meyer\u2019s class. Even on Friday night, USC played like a talented but sloppy team.\n\nThere is, though, a certain irony in what is going on at USC right now. At a time when the University of Southern California is trying to restore its honor, the one football coach it has had over the last two decades who has steered clear of drama and scandal might get run out the door.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.
