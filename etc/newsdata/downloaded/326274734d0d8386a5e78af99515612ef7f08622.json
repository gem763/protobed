If they do, the EU should encourage that.\"\n\nPoland's ruling Law and Justice Party, or PiS, won a majority in the parliamentary election on Oct 13, gaining 43.59 percent of the vote, according to results released by the State Electoral Commission. The biggest opposition party, Civic Coalition, got 27.40 percent, and its left-wing ally Lewica got 12.56 percent.\n\nThis result could be translated to 235 seats for the PiS in the lower house of parliament, where it controlled 239 of the 460 seats earlier.\n\nHowever, the PiS lost control of the Senate for the first time in four years, taking only 48 of the 100 seats, as opposition parties united to try to claim victory in the Senate and agreed not to put up candidates against each other.\n\nIn Budapest, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling party Fidesz faced its first major setback since he came to power in 2010, as the opposition gained a big win in the election for the mayor for the capital Budapest as well as other big cities.\n\nThe 44-year-old pro-EU Gergely Karacsony, the joint candidate of the united opposition parties, won 51 percent of the votes in the mayor's election on Oct 13, ousting the Fidesz-backed incumbent Istvan Tarlos who gained 44 percent of the vote.\n\nCui Hongjian, the director of the department for European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, said that the setbacks for ruling parties in Poland and Hungary, which have both been in power for a long time, were a warning for them.\n\n\"But it is good that the people showcased their ideas to the ruling parties through elections, rather than using radical ways to display their dissatisfaction or cause political turbulence one day,\" he said.\n\nComplicated relations\n\nKong Tianping, a researcher in European Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the ruling party of Poland may face some obstacles, including passing legislation and appointment and removal of personnel in the future. In Hungary, the ruling party suffered a huge blow, but its governing status is still solid.\n\nCui said that the ruling parties in both Poland and Hungary will have to find ways to adapt to the political changes, and it is also important that the new members of the EU Commission deal with the changes properly.\n\nThe relationship between the two governments and the EU is complicated. Although both countries are EU members, their ruling parties are right-wing with populist tendencies and are euroskeptic. And their concerns and some basic concepts are at odds with the EU. For instance, both Poland and Hungary have disputes with Brussels over refugees. And Poland is also one of the few countries that has opposed the EU's 2050 Climate target. Hungary has regularly clashed with Brussels over rule-of-law issues.\n\nCui said that relationships with countries in central and Eastern Europe will remain an important issue for the new European Commission.\n\n\"In the short term, the contradictions between the EU and these two countries will continue. But the EU wants to limit the differences to being an internal contradiction, and it does not want these contradictions to be further intensified,\" he said.\n\nHe added that from what we know about Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming president of the European Commission, who will take office in December, she will be willing to deal with them in a more inclusive way, rather than a confrontational way.", "description": "The pro-European Union parties' inroads in the recent elections in Poland and Hungary show that Eastern Europe's two nationalist ruling parties are not entirely unshakable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/21/5dad22d5a310cf3e97a23204.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
