She had previously appeared openly in palace-issued media.\n\nThe last time a Thai monarch had an official consort was during the reign of King Vajiravudh, who died in 1925. But consorts were more common in the 19th century, when they often received their appointments as a way of cementing alliances with regional power-brokers when the kingdom was still known as Siam.", "description": "Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi dismissed for 'disloyalty' and 'ambition' to match queen's position, palace says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/0a9455a1630e4d12b505597e55e41a14_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
