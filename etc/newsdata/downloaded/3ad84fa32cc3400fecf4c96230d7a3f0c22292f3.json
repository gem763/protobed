What about regulations on goods?\u201d\n\nUniting Ireland\u2019s political parties in condemnation, Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said: \u201cThe British proposal to reimpose a hard border on our island, as reported by RTE, is out of the question. It is further evidence of Tory recklessness and belligerence towards Ireland.\u201d\n\nDowning Street appeared to beat a hasty retreat from the plans, with Boris Johnson going on television to say they would not be in the final proposals unveiled later this month.\n\nUK sources have said the government will unveil concrete proposals to replace the backstop after the Conservative party conference this week is over \u2013 apparently to minimise the political impact on the government.\n\nTechnical talks continue in Brussels between the two teams on how to replace the backstop, which Boris Johnson has said he cannot accept \u2013 but the UK has insisted on keeping its initial proposals secret for the duration of discussions.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The UK\u2019s non-papers were given to the task force on the strict understanding they would not be shared with anyone. The taskforce has said it has received no credible proposals from the British.\n\n\u201cIreland\u2019s priorities are protecting the Good Friday Agreement, avoiding a hard border and protecting the all island economy, and protecting the EU single market and its benefits for Irish businesses and consumers.
