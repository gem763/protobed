Blanchet said that he is unequivocally against opening up the abortion debate and that anyone in his party who had a differing position would be removed.\n\nScheer responded by saying he would always vote to support a woman's right to choose \u2014 but the ambiguity in his answer opened the floor to questions from all three leaders about what he, personally, believed.\n\nWatch: Justin Trudeau presses Andrew Scheer on his views on abortion\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau presses Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer for his personal views on abortion and a woman's right to choose during the TVA French-language leaders debate Wednesday. 0:47\n\nThe three-against-one dynamic continued into the second part of the debate, when Trudeau and Singh faced off on legislation regarding medically assisted dying.\n\nSingh said that he felt the current criteria regarding the right to die are too restrictive and Trudeau said his government could be open to adjusting those restrictions.\n\nWhen the floor was opened to all four, Singh asked the leaders to state their positions on a woman's right to choose and medically assisted dying. When Scheer wavered in his answer, Trudeau alluded that there were three leaders being clear in their positions and one not being direct.\n\nEnvironment and economy\n\nThe leaders also faced tough questions from moderator Pierre Bruneau, who pointedly asked Scheer how he would explain to the 500,000 people who marched in the Montreal climate strike that he plans on being a champion of the oil and gas sector.\n\nScheer argued that the carbon tax \"doesn't work\" and that Canada's oil and gas industry has very high environmental standards. He struggled to give a clear answer when asked to defend his position on imposing a pipeline on Quebec.\n\nBlanchet retorted that Scheer believes \"the free market and divine intervention\" would solve the climate crisis.\n\nTrudeau was also asked how he would respond to Canadians who feel \"betrayed\" that he purchased the Trans Mountain pipeline. He responded that his government has a better record on the environment than any other government in Canadian history.\n\nThe leaders also clashed on asylum seekers, drug policy, and Quebec's place in Canada.\n\nTrudeau needs to appeal to francophone voters outside of Montreal, a demographic whose support he is counting on to offset potential losses in other regions. Trudeau said he is against Bill 21, but said he wouldn't intervene. He argued his government is committed to defending minority rights, drawing a comparison to francophones outside of Quebec.\n\nSingh went slightly further, calling the bill \"discriminatory\" and calling on Quebec to not isolate itself. He largely focused his debate efforts on jabbing Scheer, saying a Conservative might cut taxes for some, but would severely slash services.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer tells BQ Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet only Conservatives can represent Quebec and defeat Trudeau; Blanchet says that means Conservatives have been \"useless\" for last 4 years, during Wednesday's TVA debate. 0:52\n\nBlanchet makes his mark\n\nThe debate was especially high-stakes opportunity for Blanchet, a rookie debater, who is hoping the Bloc can make major gains in this election.\n\nOn his home turf, he challenged his counterparts to define Quebec's place in Canada, sending the three leaders scrambling to defend their positions in support of Quebec values.\n\nWhen Scheer appealed to Quebecers to vote for Conservatives as the only way to get rid of a Trudeau government, Blanchet asked Scheer if that means he's accomplished nothing in the past four years, just because he didn't form a government in 2015.\n\nWatch: Scheer tells Blanchet that Quebecers must elect Conservative MPs to defeat Trudeau\n\nAndrew Scheer calls Justin Trudeau a \"complete hypocrite\" for having two campaign planes, while Trudeau says unlike the Conservatives, his party bought carbon credits for their planes and buses, following Wednesday's TVA debate. 1:08\n\nIn his closing statement, he appealed for voters in Quebec to \"vote for women and men who resemble you\" and will defend Quebec.\n\nGreen Leader Elizabeth May and People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier were not invited to this debate.", "description": "Four federal leaders clashed on the environment, the economy\u00a0and Quebec's place in Canada as they sought to appeal to Quebec voters\u00a0in the TVA\u00a0French-language debate on Wednesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306798.1570056913!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/4-leaders.jpg"}
