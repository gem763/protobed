A Facebook spokesman said the company was looking into the ads in question.\n\nThe Conservative Party and the BBC did not immediately reply to requests for comment, but the article's author, BBC journalist Sean Coughlan, pointed out on Twitter that \"the only reference to the \u00a314bn figure in the story is from the head of stats saying it's not a correct figure to use.\"\n\nThe story included analysis from Robert Cuffe, the BBC's head of statistics, who said that the government was not calculating the spending increase in the normal way.\n\n\"Describing this as a \u00a314bn increase would make the government seem more generous than it is in fact being,\" Cuffe wrote in the analysis.\n\nFull Fact said that the BBC told the fact-checkers that it had never changed the headline of the article. Facebook confirmed that links can be altered when sharing certain content on the platform.\n\n\"We have a system that gives publishers control over how their links appear on Facebook,\" a Facebook spokesman said. \"We started with organic content and plan to expand it to ads by the end of the year.\"\n\nThe fact-checkers said that versions of the Facebook ad using the altered headline have been viewed between 220,000 and 510,000 times since Sept. 2. The ads were showing as \"inactive\" in Facebook's public ad library at the time of writing.", "description": "Facebook fact-checker finds Conservatives ran ads with altered BBC headline", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8D00H_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
