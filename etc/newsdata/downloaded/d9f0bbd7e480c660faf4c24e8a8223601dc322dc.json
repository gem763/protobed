I don\u2019t have to put up with this, so I went and got the food. I want my money back,\u201d Price said.\n\nHowever, when she came back inside the restaurant, Price began throwing the bags of food at the store\u2019s manager, who then threw a blender at Price, striking her in the face and causing her to fall on the floor.\n\nThe appliance broke Price\u2019s nose and shattered her cheekbone.\n\nWhen asked if she regretted throwing the bags at the manager, Price said she did not believe there would have been a different outcome had she refrained from tossing the food.\n\n\u201cI feel like even if we would have just went verbal back and forth that it still would have escalated to something else,\u201d she commented.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s released a statement regarding the incident that said its customers and employees remain their top priority.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our customers and employees is of utmost importance to us. We are looking into this matter and will take the appropriate steps once our investigation is complete,\u201d the statement read.\n\nPrice said she had surgery on her face following the incident and noted that recovery was difficult.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had surgery. I\u2019ve had a lot of doctor\u2019s appointments, the follow-up. Hard mornings, hard afternoons,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nHowever, local authorities said no charges have yet been filed against anyone connected to the incident.", "description": "A McDonald's employee threw a blender at a woman in\u00a0Colerain Township, Ohio, after she complained that her order was not correct.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/McDonalds-Straw-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
