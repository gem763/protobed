I went there, too, to go visit him. I wouldn\u2019t do it again.\n\nIt\u2019s hella gloomy. Nobody smiles. It\u2019s like everybody just hates that they\u2019re there, I\u2019m like, \u201cDamn.\u201d I had to get out of there, bro.\u201d\n\nHart:\n\nSounds like L.A\n\nI\u2019m not talking about the city\n\nI was going to say the Lakers organization.\n\nUnder Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka, the Lakers had all kinds of problems on and off the court. A couple times, Hart felt the brunt of the Lakers\u2019 issues. He reportedly got blamed for management\u2019s mangled draft process, and he said he learned he got traded on Twitter.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be even slightly surprising if he thought words like \u201cdepressing\u201d and \u201cgloomy\u201d accurately described the Lakers.\n\nThe only surprise was him saying it. Most players take the high road publicly when leaving a team, no matter how the really feel.\n\nHart did just that after his podcast remarks gained attention:\n\nHart:\n\nLet\u2019s make this clear. I loved my time in LA and loved my coaches, teammates and training staff. Got nothing but love and respect for the front office \u2014 Josh Hart (@joshhart) September 5, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nI played my ass off for the purple and gold. Played hurt and never had an excuse. I\u2019m truly grateful to the Lakers organization and I do understand the NBA is a business. But as a player you just want the courtesy of a phone call saying I got traded and not finding out on Twitter \u2014 Josh Hart (@joshhart) September 5, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe Hart\u2019s issue with the Lakers is limited to only how they handled his exit. It didn\u2019t sound that way on the podcast, but perhaps he didn\u2019t accurately convey how he felt about his time in Los Angeles.\n\nThat\u2019s a tough sell, though.\n\nMost likely, Hart made the classic mistake: He told the truth.", "description": "Under Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka, the Lakers had all kinds of problems on and off the court.
