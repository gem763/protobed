If it's not there, then we are going down.\"\n\nEskom said close to a quarter of its roughly 45,000-megawatt capacity was offline on Wednesday because of unplanned breakdowns and faults including boiler tube leaks and a broken conveyer belt for coal.\n\nThe company's executives had achieved some improvements in plant performance earlier in the year, but analysts said the company's spare capacity had declined in recent weeks.\n\nThe cuts come at a critical time for energy policy, as cabinet ministers prepare to debate the country's long-term electricity generation plan.\n\nPublishing that plan is seen as crucial to unlock sorely needed investment in power generation.\n\nThe government is expected to name a new chief executive for Eskom after the previous CEO stepped down in July - and to publish a paper detailing further steps to reform the utility.\n\n'Gold index is up'\n\nDebilitating power cuts in February and March pushed first-quarter economic growth into contraction and raised the likelihood of South Africa losing its investment-grade rating.\n\nOn the stock market, gold producer Sibanye-Stillwater on Wednesday led the Top 40 index higher as the precious metals miner benefited from booming palladium.\n\nThe metal, used in vehicle exhausts to reduce harmful emissions, rose 2.4 percent to 26,510 rand ($1,774.32) an ounce, after hitting a record high of 26,588 rand ($1,779.23) earlier.\n\nThis pushed Sibanye up 5.44 percent to 25.01 rand ($1.67).\n\nThe weaker currency sent other commodity stocks such as Harmony Gold up 2.99 percent to 44.49 rand ($2.98), and AngloGold Ashanti up 2.11 percent to 300.19 rand ($20.90).\n\nA weaker rand is beneficial for commodity companies because their exports - sold in dollars - are more affordable to purchasers.\n\nThe Johannesburg All-Share index rose 0.93 percent to 56,090, while the Top 40 index gained 0.94 percent to close at 49,855 points.\n\n\"Today you've got everything going positive,\" Cratos Capital equities trader Greg Davies said. \"The gold index is up [2.18 percent] and the resources are a bit better because of the weaker rand.\"", "description": "Despite economic weakness, utility troubles and weak currency, high metal prices drive Johannesburg stock market upward.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/386db62ebe7b4ec7a204eb504ba31ca1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
