Grateful\n\nIn recent years, Halloween has become a mine field for culturally appropriated costumes. Most people don\u2019t want to offend anyone on Halloween (heck, that\u2019s probably why you\u2019re reading this article right now). But we can\u2019t use ignorance as an excuse for costumes that fail to recognize cultural significance and history.\n\nWe\u2019ll break it all down for you here so you can have a Halloween costume that let\u2019s your imagination and creativity run wild while also respecting cultures, ethnicities and religions around you.\n\nDEFINING CULTURAL APPROPRIATION\n\nMan in 'Mexican Man' Halloween costume. (Photo: LUNAMARINA, Getty Images)\n\nSo what, exactly, is cultural appropriation?\n\nOxford Dictionaries defines cultural appropriation as \u201cthe unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not so cut and dry. For example, there was a big debate in 2017 about the appropriateness of children dressing up as Moana. And another debate about people dressing up as Black Panther. When is it celebrating and respecting culture and when is it crossing the line?\n\nA lot of this discussion revolves around intention and the history of that culture and peoples.\n\nActress Auli\u2019i Cravalho, who voiced Moana, spoke out about the costume debate saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely appropriate. It\u2019s done in the spirit of love and for Disney and for the little ones who just want to dress up as their favorite heroine, I\u2019m all for it. Parents can dress up as Moana, too.\u201d\n\nSterling K. Brown echoed those sentiments about Black Panther.\n\nMore: The ultimate Halloween party-planning checklist\n\nCULTURALLY APPROPRIATED COSTUMES TO AVOID\n\nThere is a line, but there are also gray areas. While Moana and Black Panther may be ok, some costumes should be avoided all together because there are some deeper and historically significant implications behind certain outfits.\n\n1. ANYTHING INVOLVING BLACKFACE\n\nThere is a long and terrible history surrounding blackface. Mostly it\u2019s rooted in 19th century minstrel shows in which white actors donned blackface for comedy. The white people got a laugh all at the expense of black people who were demoralized and hurt by the portrayal.\n\nThere is never an excuse to use someone\u2019s skin tone as a costume.\n\n2. GEISHA\n\nGeishas \u2014 along with Asian culture in general \u2014 have been sexualized, which is a problem in and of itself when choosing a Halloween costume. Furthermore, using stereotypes when making costume decisions is never a good idea. It ignores the rich and complex history of the group and makes assumptions that are often false.\n\n3. MEN\u2019S ARAB SHEIK COSTUME\n\nThere are no ifs, ands, or buts about it, Arab Sheik costumes \u2014 and any costumes that seek to generalize Middle Eastern culture \u2014 are highly offensive. It plays into stereotypes and, even worse, a costume sword that usually accompanies the costume portrays the group of individuals in an intimidating light.\n\n4. VOODOO WITCH DOCTOR\n\nNPR reports the term \u201cvoodoo\u201d is often a catch-all for \u201cseveral distinct, but related religions that combine elements of Catholicism and West African Vodun.\u201d The problem is \u2014 and this is really just the start of the problems \u2014 most of us know nothing about the history and principals Vodou as an actual religion. Instead, what we see is a commercialized, Hollywood-inspired, spooky and often wildly misrepresented caricature that has no actual basis in Vodou.\n\nReligions and faith should not be used as resources for costumes but instead respected for their history and traditions. Any costume that seeks to continue false ideology and stereotypes has no place at Halloween time.\n\n5. NATIVE AMERICAN PRINCESS\n\nYes, you can dress up like Moana. No, you cannot dress up like Pocahontas. Remember when we talked about that gray area, fine line above? This is it. And here\u2019s why: The Disney version of Pocahontas is based on a real person and the real story wasn\u2019t all happily ever after.\n\n\u201cHistory has almost completely erased the name of this Powhatan child who was stolen from her family, taken prisoner, forced into a child marriage, made a mockery of, harassed, and killed by a \u2018New World\u2019 disease she never would have contracted otherwise,\u201d Medium reports.\n\nThe article goes on to say the Powhatan nation has long been ashamed of the Disney adaptation. It romanticizes the oppression and destruction of their people.\n\nTo dress up as Pocahontas or any Native American princess ignores the history of oppression and minimizes the ceremonial significance of their wardrobe, which has ultimately marginalized and stereotyped this culture.\n\n6. GYPSY\n\nDangling jewelry, colorful bohemian skirts, scarves and a head wrap make up what most of us know as a \u201cgypsy\u201d costume. What most of us don\u2019t know is the real history behind the Romani people who suffered intense hatred and were considered lower class citizens.\n\nAccording to Cracked, even the word gypsy comes from sordid origins. \u201cThe term \u2018Gypsy\u2019 evolved from the habit of calling the people Egyptians, because they sort of looked Egyptian and the locals were apparently too shy to ask the people where they were actually from.\u201d\n\nMore: 3 Creative ways to decorate Halloween cupcakes\n\n7. MEXICAN MAN\n\nLet\u2019s collectively face palm at this costume fail, which seems intent on poking fun and stereotyping an entire culture of people.\n\nThe description of one \"Mexican Man\" costume reads, \u201cSalsa on into Halloween in the Mexican Man Adult Men\u2019s Costume.\u201d But please don\u2019t. It continues, \u201cStart your own fiesta in this vibrantly striped poncho with hysterical black mustache.\u201d Hysterical black mustache?! Need we say more?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fun and easy costume, why not go with a classic skeleton?
