What matters more are the state-by-state numbers, and even the congressional district numbers, because it\u2019s in states and congressional districts that elections are won or lost. And there\u2019s a little news on that front that doesn\u2019t fit the storyline.\n\nHarry Enten of CNN writes that a recent poll from Wisconsin has impeach-and-remove at just 44 percent. He also points to a recent Florida poll that has impeach-and-remove at 46 percent, two points behind the number opposed to it.", "description": "There no constitutional requirement to vote here, of course.
