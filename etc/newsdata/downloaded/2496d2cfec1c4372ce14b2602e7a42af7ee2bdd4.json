That followed the London exchange\u2019s public rejection of the surprise offer in mid-September, citing a \u201clack of strategic merit.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition would have created a $70 billion company. But the London exchange cited concerns including the Hong Kong exchange\u2019s ties to the government of the Chinese territory. That gives the mainland\u2019s ruling Communist Party influence over its operations.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange Group also owns the Milan exchange and the Russell Indexes in the United States.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange Group earlier cited strategic and regulatory reasons for turning down the proposal. One possible roadblock was concern in Britain about the possibility of the Chinese government influencing one of the bastions of global capitalism.\n\nBut the bid by the Hong Kong bourse also included a requirement that the London exchange scrap plans to buy a financial data provider, Refinitiv.\n\nThe London side also said the deal lacked the strategic merit of acquiring Refinitiv. It also said the offer, three quarters of which was in the form of shares, fell \u201csubstantially short of an appropriate valuation.\u201d\n\nThe bid was made against a backdrop of increasingly violent protests in Hong Kong, a former British colony that came under Beijing\u2019s rule in 1997.\n\nThe political turmoil has raised issues about the city\u2019s role as a regional financial hub, as China exerts increasing influence over the semi-autonomous territory.", "description": "Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. said it was \u201cunable to engage\u201d with managers of the London Stock Exchange Group.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS818_lse_08_ZG_20191008013255.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
