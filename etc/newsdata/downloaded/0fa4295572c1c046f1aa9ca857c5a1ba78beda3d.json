Specifically, there is no margin for error, and he has to make adjustments quickly.\n\n\"You can't make mistakes against Tom Brady and coach [Bill] Belichick and the Patriots the way we did in both games, early in the game,\" Mahomes told King. \"We obviously made things happen in the second half of both those games and gave ourselves chances to win. But if we just go in with the mindset of making adjustments even quicker, making sure that you go out there with a game plan and execute at a high level just from the beginning. They're gonna keep executing, so you better too.\"\n\nHead coach Andy Reid appreciated Mahomes' assessment of his performances against the Patriots. \"Astute observation by a smart player,\" Reid told King after he had relayed Mahomes' comments. \"It's always a short feel-out process against a championship team, fast and furious.

Unfortunately, Brady would get the final possession, marching down the field to set up Stephen Gostkowski for a chip-shot field goal to win the game.\n\nThe story in the AFC Championship at Kansas City was much of the same. Trailing the Patriots 14-0 at halftime, Mahomes once again brought the Chiefs to life in the second half. They rattled off 24 points in a wild fourth quarter capped off by a field goal to force overtime as the clock expired.\n\nBut the Patriots would win the toss, elect to receive, and again, Brady marched down the field and won the AFC title before the Chiefs offense had a chance in the extra period. The Patriots would go on to win the Super Bowl, while the Chiefs were left to wonder what happened.\n\nRead more: FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGS: The expert consensus on the top 20 quarterbacks of 2019\n\nMahomes and his teammates will get at least one more shot at the Patriots this year when they meet in New England once again in Week 14.
