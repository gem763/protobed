However, he also shared some thoughts on marriage that seemed to take Corden by surprise.\n\nAfter explaining how he and Kim Kardashian-West have been married for five years, West went on to explain, \"Marriage years are different than human years.\"\n\n'Like you know how dog years are like seven years? Every marriage year is like 100 years,\" West joked, adding that it feels like he's been married for \"500 years.\"\n\nHe also dished on how, in his darkest moments, his family and friends were hoping he'd be OK, and had his best intentions at heart, but didn't know how to get through to him.\n\n\"People in my family were praying for me, but they couldn't call me and scream at me. I'm a grown man,\" West shared. \"But it was God that came and put this thing on my heart and asked if I was ready to be in service to him.\"\n\nWest boldly admitted, \"I have no regret and no shame.\"\n\nThe rapper also performed one of his iconic hits, \"Jesus Walks,\" although with some subtle changes in a few of the lyrics.\n\nThe segment came to an end with a lively performance of \"Selah,\" off Jesus Is King, before the plane landed and the pair ended the first installment of \"Airpool Karaoke\" with a friendly hug.\n\nRecently, Corden dished about his past run-ins with West while driving around Los Angeles with Chance the Rapper for a previous installment of \"Carpool Karaoke.\" Check out the video below to hear more.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nVal Chmerkovskiy Epically Responds to Kanye West's 'Dancing With the Stars' Lyric\n\nKanye West Finally Drops New Album 'Jesus Is King'\n\nKanye West Explains Why 'Jesus Is King' Once Again Didn't Drop When It Was Supposed To\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "The rapper and the talk show host headed to the open skies for a special version of 'Carpool Karaoke' on Monday.", "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DMK4v9RMkdiDRGAU0ZZGeg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/da9d9c590526dfdeb83d46c161302434", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
