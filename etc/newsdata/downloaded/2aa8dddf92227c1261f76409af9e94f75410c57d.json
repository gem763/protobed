She wouldn't speak to me for about a year and a half. I just totally collapsed. I went in on myself and had a nervous breakdown. I lost the plot for a while.'\n\nLess than two years later, Johnson \u2013 who allegedly tried to sell details of their relationship for \u00a350,000 to a tabloid newspaper, a claim he denies \u2013 was reported to have cheated on Charlotte, resulting in her kicking him out of the luxury flat they shared.\n\n'Cold as ice': Charlotte admits she was 'callous' to her mother when she decided she was moving out. She didn't speak to her for nearly two years\n\nHappier times: The couple star in an on-screen reconciliation with the singer but also face the challenge of James' diagnosis of a rare incurable illness\n\nChild star: Charlotte's rise to fame stalled when 'everyone in the industry (started) cutting us absolutely dead'\n\nCharlotte says of the family rift: 'We had a blazing row and I just said, 'I don't have to do this. I'm not going to live with you. I don't need to live with you any more. I'm moving out.'\n\nMaria tells Charlotte: 'You actually stepped over me, Charlotte. I went on the floor begging you and you stepped over me.'\n\nCharlotte admits to having been 'really callous'. 'I dealt with it awfully,' she says.\n\n'But, on the other side of that, I was in pain as well. I hated not speaking to you.'\n\nThe family hugged after Maria broke down in tears during filming, saying: 'I went from looking after my little girl and helping with her career to everyone in the industry cutting us absolutely dead.\n\n'I had nothing. Especially because I had lost my daughter.'\n\nCharlotte Church: My Family And Me is on Channel 4 at 10pm on Thursday.", "description": "Singer Charlotte Church has had an emotional reconciliation with her mother and stepfather in a Devon retreat for a new Channel 4 documentary.
