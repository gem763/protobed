UK-listed Vast Resources is expected to sign a deal this week to search for diamonds.\n\nChitando also said gold, the single biggest mineral export, would generate $4 billion in four years time while platinum would bring in another $3 billion as a raft of projects come on stream.\n\nAnglo Platinum and Impala Platinum Holdings have platinum mines in Zimbabwe.\n\nKaro Resources, partly owned by South Africa\u2019s Tharisa Holdings is building an integrated platinum mine and refinery while a Russian consortium and Zimbabwean investors are developing a platinum project near Harare.", "description": "Zimbabwe expects to increase diamond production to 11 million carats by 2023 from 3.2 million carats last year, the mines minister said on Monday, part of an ambitious plan to raise mining output and earn the country $12 billion a year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440744137&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D16N-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
