A human rights tragedy.\n\nAnd that bit alone \u2014 the part about being chained as part of the education process of Islam \u2014 would seem, should seem perfect for CAIR response. Right?\n\nCAIR, after all, touts a mission that\u2019s dedicated to dispelling common myths about Muslims \u2014 particularly those supposed myths that paint Islam as a religion of extremism, bent on a convert-or-die type of proselyting.\n\nBut here\u2019s what CAIR National\u2019s focused on instead: spreading unproven allegations about a \u201cwhite woman\u2019s \u201cassault\u201d of a Muslim shopper at T.J. Maxx in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.\n\nSpreading hysteria about supposed Islamophobia \u2014 facts be danged.\n\nSpreading more allegations \u2014 unfounded \u2014 about the inherent anti-Muslim hate of President Donald Trump supporters.\n\nWhat\u2019s known is this: A woman shopping at T.J. Maxx in Brooklyn over the weekend was captured on video coming out of the store, holding up her middle finger, slapping at the camera and warning, \u201cGet out of my face or I\u2019m going to f\u2014 you up,\u201d and then being escorted by her friend from the scene as she vowed, \u201cI\u2019m gonna hit him, I\u2019m gonna hit him.\u201d\n\nThe video doesn\u2019t explain why the woman was angry. The video doesn\u2019t give any context of what transpired in the store between this woman and the guy shooting the video \u2014 later identified as a Muslim man named Mido Mourad who was shopping for winter clothes with his family. Mourad, it was also identified later \u2014 but not by CAIR; rather by The New York Daily News \u2014 is a journalist from Cairo living in the city.\n\nEnter CAIR National, with a sob story of a hate crime against an innocent Muslim family.\n\n\u201cWhile a Muslim family was shopping inside the TJ Maxx in Bay Ridge, a white woman began to harass the family and yelled at them to \u2018Go Back to Your Country!\u2019 The family asked for assistance from TJ Maxx to deal with the harassment but were allegedly refused any help.\u201d CAIR wrote on its website. \u201cThe family called the police, and while waiting, the white female assailant allegedly attacked and struck the Muslim man. The family filed harassment complaint with NYPD. The family captured the assault on video.\u201d\n\nExcept the video doesn\u2019t exactly show that.\n\nThe video shows an angry New Yorker doing what angry New Yorkers do \u2014 flipping the bird. The slap at the camera was over-the-top, but hardly to the level of what CAIR and this Muslim man-slash-journalist painted.\n\nFrom CAIR National\u2019s Twitter feed: \u201cCAIR-NY: Pols demand hate crime investigation after woman attacks #Muslim family in #Brooklyn store, yells \u2018Go back to your country!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother CAIR tweet, a day or so earlier: \u201c\u2018My wife and I were attacked by this white lady at T.J. Maxx in Bay Ridge \u2026 We were at the TJ Maxx trying to buy winter clothes for our twins,\u2019 Mourad said.\u201d\n\nAnother, a couple hours before that one: \u201c\u2018It is unacceptable that TJ Maxx would value the business of a bigot over protecting their Muslim customers from repugnant harassment,\u2019 said CAIR-NY Litigation Director Ahmed Mohamed.\u201d\n\nAnother, before that: \u201c#BreakingNews VIDEO: CAIR-NY Calls for Hate Crime Probe of Anti-#Muslim, Anti-#Immigrant Assault at TJ Maxx in Bay Ridge. \u2026 #Islamophobia #racism #Immigration #WhiteSupremacy.\u201d\n\nAnd yet another, before that: \u201cVIDEO: @CairNewYork Calls for #HateCrime Probe of Anti-#Muslim, Anti-#Immigrant Assault at @tjmaxx in Bay RIdge.\u201d\n\nGood Lord.\n\nIt\u2019s as if the woman had been wielding a knife, stabbing away while shouting, \u201cAll glory to God\u201d or something.\n\nThe media, absent facts, ran with the CAIR version.\n\nPatch reported, \u201cMuslim Family Attacked At Brooklyn TJ Maxx: Video.\u201d\n\nThe New York Daily News reported, \u201cPols demand hate crime investigation after woman attacks Muslim family in Brooklyn store, yells \u2018Go back to your country!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd Newsweek wrote this, \u201cMuslim Family Says \u2018Trump Supporter\u2019 Harassed Then in TJ Maxx Store, Yelled \u2018Go Back to Your Count[r]y.\u201d\n\nWhere\u2019d the \u201cTrump supporter\u201d tag come from?\n\nFrom none other than Cairo journalist Mido Mourad \u2014 the very guy who says he was attacked \u2014 who posted that conclusion on his own Facebook page.\n\n\u201cCrazy trump supporter attack Muslims in NYC,\u201d Mourad wrote in English, above a post he penned in foreign language.\n\nAnd now the pressure\u2019s on for police, the community, government, whomever to do something \u2014 do something! \u2014 to stop the Islamophobia of Trump supporters.\n\nIt\u2019s all such deception.\n\nIt\u2019s all so preliminary and absent facts.\n\nBut that\u2019s CAIR for you; that\u2019s the anti-Trumping media for you.\n\nIn plain sight is a story of egregious Islam-tied abuse and violence \u2014 against little boys, no less. But rather than report that inconvenient truth, rather than focus on any uncomfortable truths of Islam and sharia that might cast negative light on the Muslim community, Islam\u2019s apologists distract with a tale of woe about an Islamaphobic white woman. Er, make that an Islamaphobic angry white woman. Oh wait, make that an Islamophobic angry white Trump supporting white woman.\n\nYeah, that\u2019ll work.\n\nGood one, CAIR.\n\nIt\u2019s just too bad about those poor Nigerian boys, isn\u2019t it. Too bad, so sad. But there are Trump supporters to fry.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
