Leading British sock firm Corgi Socks told POLITICO that U.S. regulations did not present a problem for their business.\n\nBoris Johnson vowed to take Donald Trump to task over what he described as trade restrictions on socks as part of a post-Brexit trade deal.\n\n\u201cWe are at the upper end of the sock market and have a good U.S. business,\u201d said the company\u2019s Managing Director Chris Jones, who is enthusiastic about a post-Brexit trade deal with Trump. Around 20 percent of their production is exported to the U.S. with half that going to Europe. \u201cDuty tariffs [with the U.S.] are a bit of a barrier, regulations are not. We have no problem with regulations selling in the U.S.\u201d\n\nJones said he had never heard of a rule that sock imports have to be fire-tested twice. \"That said, the U.S. would probably have strict rules on [any] product coming in that it meets certain standards, not that we ever get asked for that sort of testing. All our socks are made of natural fibers, which like hair does not burn so we would not have a problem. I think that was a case of the PM referring to strict U.S. import regulations, but using a bad example off the cuff.\"\n\n\u201cWe are confident after Brexit if a U.S. trade deal can be done it will be very good for business,\u201d he added.\n\nRueven Fletcher, owner of the Sock Council, a U.K. retailer which describes itself as \u201cconnoisseurs of fine hosiery\u201d and \u201ca membership organisation that celebrates good socks,\u201d was less complimentary about Johnson\u2019s intervention. \u201cMy opinion is that if it comes out of Boris Johnson\u2019s mouth it\u2019s likely not to be true, you may quote me on that if it helps,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesperson for No.10 Downing Street said that the 19 percent tariff on socks represents \"a significant barrier to market access for start ups and new entrants.\"\n\nAnd on fire regulations, the spokesperson added: \"U.K. fabric and textile manufacturers already adhere to our existing high standards, including fire-testing, but some need to undergo another fire-test to be eligible to sell in the U.S. market.\"\n\nJohnson has long set his sights on striking a free trade deal with the U.S. once the U.K. leaves the EU, while Trump has said a deal could be done within a year.\n\nBut the prime minister insisted the British health service will not be \u201con the table\u201d in talks and promised the U.K. would \u201cnot in any way prejudice or jeopardize our standards on animal welfare or food hygiene.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson said British-made socks attract a 19 percent tariff in the US.", "authors": ["James Randerson", "Emilio Casalicchio", "Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1174186776-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
