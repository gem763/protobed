Its mission: to explore international harbours; to transport chemicals to markets; and to boldly go where no ship of its kind flying a South African flag has gone before.\n\nFor the ships owners, Sasol and Nduna Maritime, it's a R400 million investment by way of an enterprise and supplier development (ESD) deal made possible through the Sasol Siyakha Trust, which makes investment on behalf of Sasol.\n\nThe companies want to stimulate South Africa\u2019s blue economy by directing some of the R1.8 billion Sasol spends every year on shipping goods from South Africa to global markets to local businesses.\n\n\u201cAs a global producer of a number of chemical products, we supply numerous markets around the world with products made in South Africa. Through Nduna Maritime, we are extending our value chain participation through a wholly owned South African business,\u201d said Vuyo Kahla, executive vice president of advisory, assurance and supply chain at Sasol Limited.\n\nThe vessel can carry 37,000 deadweight tons of cargo and is equipped with 47 tanks.\n\nIt called on the Port of Durban on 1 August for its inaugural load destined for markets in Asia, reported South Africa Shipping News.\n\nNduna Maritime is a subsidiary of the Mnambithi Group, which is involved in bulk liquid shipping, terminal operation in Durban, and coal mining.\n\nAlong with exporting goods to Asia, the vessel would also handle inbound shipments of vegetable oils, caustic soda, phosphoric acid, and other chemical products for companies such as Omnia, PetroSA, and Sappi, Vusi Mazibuko, Mnambithi group executive chairman, said on the company's website.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the acquisition and have long term plans to own and operate our own tankers. We also have plans to expand our fleet in both liquid bulk and dry bulk vessels which will see us further deepen South African ownership of the maritime industry,\u201d said Mazibuko.\n\nHere's what it looks like on-board:\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The vessel can carry 37,000 deadweight tons of cargo and is equipped with 47 tanks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9460/e374d42164f546c3a89184b89ca334ef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
