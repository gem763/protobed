Devin Nunes (R-CA) on Tuesday night, Carlson brought up the conservative lawmaker\u2019s current lawsuit against Twitter. A judge recently ruled that Nunes\u2019 suit, in which he alleges the social media company enabled parody Twitter accounts to defame him, can move forward. (Yes, it is the one involving the cow account that ended up getting more Twitter followers than Nunes himself.)\n\nDiscussing the lawsuit, Nunes complained that Twitter was \u201callowing anonymous accounts, hundreds of them, to slander and defame me on a daily basis,\u201d before wondering aloud whether the company\u2019s \u201cboard members really know what Twitter\u2019s been up to.\u201d\n\nCarlson, meanwhile, replied by suggesting that Twitter was just plain evil.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a company that\u2019s hurt this country more than Twitter,\u201d the Fox News star said. \u201cMaybe there are some. I can\u2019t think of one. If you look at the hate and the division and the cruelty that\u2019s now common\u2014it wasn\u2019t common ten years ago. Twitter\u2019s a huge part of that.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for critics and media folks to react to Carlson\u2019s take, especially considering the network he works for.\n\n\u201cTucker Carlson just killed irony. RIP,\u201d writer and Daily Beast contributor Molly Jong-Fast noted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI can think of one,\u201d Politico correspondent Tim Alberta tweeted.\n\nThe Nation\u2019s sports editor Dave Zirin, meanwhile, cut right to the chase. \u201cCorrecting it for @TuckerCarlson who like most heirs is a little slow: \u2018It\u2019s hard to think of a company that\u2019s hurt this country more than Fox News,\u2019\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Fox prime-time host\u2014who has been the target of a sustained advertiser boycott over his anti-immigrant and inflammatory rhetoric\u2014went on to insist that Twitter \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves\u201d while telling Nunes he hopes the congressman\u2019s lawsuit calls attention to the \u201chate and division\u201d that Twitter is supposedly responsible for.", "description": "\u201cIf you look at the hate and the division and the cruelty that\u2019s now common\u2014it wasn\u2019t common ten years ago.
