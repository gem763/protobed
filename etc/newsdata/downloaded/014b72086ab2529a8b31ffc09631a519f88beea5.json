Add Interest\n\nTrump, who said Thursday that gun control negotiations were moving \u201cvery slowly,\u201d behind closed doors days earlier reassured a room full of donors that those concerned about second amendment issues \u201cvoted for the right president.\u201d\n\nThe comments came amid a series of California fundraisers the president attend this week, which included stops in Beverly Hills, San Diego and Los Angeles, and kicked off on Tuesday with a plush and private Palo Alto luncheon with a starting ticket price of $1,000 at a secluded mansion of tech giant and Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy, where he raised $3 million.\n\nAt McNealy\u2019s 32,000-square-foot mansion, with 400 guests in attendance, the president on Tuesday spoke for nearly an hour before taking a handful of questions.\n\nOne donor in attendance at the Palo Alto fundraiser, Paul Bruno, a small business owner and National Rifle Association member who\u2019s wary of new gun control measures, said he was called on by the president and asked how he planned to address the renewed push for gun control.\n\nBruno, who said he preceded his question by telling the president he was a gun-carrying NRA member to applause from those in attendance, tells ABC News Trump reassured him and the guests: \u201cIf you believe in the Second Amendment you voted for the right president.\u201d\n\nBruno said he was thoroughly encouraged by the president\u2019s full answer regarding addressing gun control, giving the president a thumbs up before sitting down.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the Trump campaign did not push back on Bruno\u2019s characterization of the event but did not provide further comment.\n\nNicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe president's comments at this week\u2019s fundraiser come nearly two months after a pair of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Deyton, Ohio left more than 30 people dead \u2014 and as Congress remains stagnant on gun control while lawmakers await proposals from the White House.\n\nIn an interview with FOX News Thursday, Trump seemed to temper expectations that a deal could be on the horizon, saying negotiations were moving \u201cvery slowly.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, ABC News reported the White House distanced itself from a proposal Attorney General William Barr shopped to conservative Republicans in Congress this week that would expand background checks. \"That is not a White House document, and any suggestion to the contrary is completely false,\" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley said.\n\nWhat the president decides to do and how far he will go to address gun control remains a crucial issues for the administration and for the president as he heads into 2020 facing reelection.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection team knows gun issues could play a major role in next year's election and they\u2019ve been keeping a close eye on how supporters view the issue\u2014 with data collected by the campaign showing that the president getting behind any gun control legislation would pose a political problem for Trump ahead of 2020, as previously reported by ABC News.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, the National Rifle Association was among the biggest supporters of Trump, spending more than $30 million on pro-Trump and anti-Hillary Clinton campaign, according to Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 analysis of campaign finance data.\n\nTrump\u2019s pledge to protect the Second Amendment was one of many promises the president made to his wealthy donors while hopping from one ritzy fundraiser to another in California this week.\n\nAt a later fundraiser in Beverly Hills Tuesday evening, hosted by one of Trump's most generous and committed benefactors, Beverly Hills developer Geoffrey Palmer, the president promised to the crowd of about 900 supporters that he has a solution for the homelessness in Los Angeles and San Francisco, while blaming the state\u2019s Democratic leadership for the issues, a donor who attended the event told ABC News.\n\nJonathan Leibson/Getty Images for LACMA\n\nTrump has been vocal about the homelessness crisis in the state in the past week, blasting officials in Los Angeles and other cities in California to \u201cclean it up.\u201d\n\nAt the Beverly Hills fundraiser, featuring president's son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, senior campaign adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle and billionaire financier and Trump's longtime friend Tom Barrack, the president spoke at length about his economic record and foreign policy. And during a question and answer session, according to an attendee, Trump, when asked by an attendee about the burden of college tuition for her daughter, joked in response, saying that she can now pay for the tuition since she just took a $100,000 photo with himself.\n\nBut as much warm reception as he received at his fundraisers, Trump\u2019s visit to a state that he lost by more than 30 points in 2016 wasn\u2019t without noise. Even before his arrival, the news of his fundraisers in California, first made public by The Hollywood Reporters\u2019 reporting, caused an outburst from critics, including \"Will & Grace\" stars Eric McCormick and Debra Messing calling for the list of Trump fundraiser attendees to be made public.\n\nTrump called the outburst an attempt to create a \u201cblacklist of Trump supporters.\u201d\n\nEvery stop the president made during the visit this week was met with anti-Trump protesters, and the Democratic majority in the California legislature at the state level has been in constant clash with Trump\u2019s policies imposed at the federal level as recently as this week.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s rare visit to the Golden State -- which went for Democrats by landslide in the past few cycles -- is not necessarily an effort to flip the state.\n\nDuring the two-day fundraising dash this week, President Trump raised a whopping $15 million for his high-dollar reelection fundraising vehicle Trump Victory, as he picks up new support from California\u2019s wealthy donors. He also is backed by some of his early California supporters including Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel and former Facebook virtual reality lead and Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey.", "description": "At a private fundraiser this week in Palo Alto, President Donald Trump reassured high-dollar donors that he will protect Second Amendment.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-01-as-gy-190920_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
