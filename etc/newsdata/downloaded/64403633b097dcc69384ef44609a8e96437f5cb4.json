At the beginning of March, I wrote: \u201cBut it looks more and more likely that Mueller\u2019s dance of a thousand veils will end with . . . more veils. The Mueller obsessives want him to be a deus ex machina who delivers irrefutable grounds for impeachment and I-told-you-sos. But that Mueller may never arrive. He may never even say a word about it in public at all.\u201d\n\nThat may change, particularly if Congress calls on or subpoenas Mueller to testify, which seems likely. But it is a remarkable thing that for the last two years, Robert Mueller has arguably been the second-most discussed, debated and dissected American in the world after Donald Trump himself. And yet most people don\u2019t even know what his voice sounds like.\n\nYou can\u2019t say the same about the president, alas. To say that he has been vocal is like saying tornadoes are breezy. He reportedly called the Mueller probe a witch hunt 183 times on Twitter alone. I was always a collusion skeptic but I always believed that the investigation was warranted. I\u2019m with David French and Trey Gowdy \u2014 even if the Steele dossier hadn\u2019t existed, there would still have been an investigation \u2014 and the need for one. I want to see more, but I believe Mueller\u2019s findings and I believe that Barr\u2019s summary is at the very least technically accurate.\n\nAnd for that reason, Trump world has good reason to celebrate and even to gloat, but it seems worth noting that Mueller\u2019s \u201cwitch hunt\u201d wasn\u2019t what his detractors made it out to be. He racked up an impressive number of indictments and the president\u2019s campaign manager may spend the rest of his life in prison. More to the point, if he was the corrupt, deep-state operative (the head of a \u201cdeep state crime family\u201d no less!) this is not the conclusion of this chapter one would expect. There are certainly things one can legitimately criticize Mueller \u2014 and the entire probe \u2014 about (Andy McCarthy has offered many in a reasonable and even-handed way). But if this was \u201cthe most corrupt investigation I have ever seen\u201d in the words of Rudy Giuliani, one would have expected Mueller to have delivered a different report in a different way. If he were a \u201cHalf-man, half-freak of government\u201d who \u201cwill stop at nothing to get what he\u2019s after\u201d you\u2019d think he wouldn\u2019t have stopped where the evidence stopped.\n\nMueller\u2019s report is indeed very bad news for a lot of grifters, activists, and partisans who assured the \u201cresistance\u201d that Trump would be frog-marched out of the White House. But at least some (though certainly not all) of those people seem to realize it, which is why they are moping like a dog whose food bowl has been moved. You can\u2019t say the same of many of the people who eagerly peddled the partisan slander that Mueller was a corrupt henchman of the Deep State.", "description": "Trump world has good reason to celebrate and even to gloat, but it seems worth noting that Mueller\u2019s \u201cwitch hunt\u201d wasn\u2019t what his detractors made it out to be.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
