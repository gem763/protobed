Perhaps then we'll see some congestion relief.\n\nThe only problem with that, is some people might see an ease in volume as an enticing invitation to drive their own vehicles again.\n\nThe city needs to keep that from happening (somehow) so the Stage 2 expansion will bring an even greater improvement for the folks causing the greatest commuter jams: those coming into the core from the suburbs.\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nBefore I go, it's Tuesday, so that means I get to pick a Traffic Tuesday song on Ottawa Morning.\n\nSomething to keep you entertained during the busiest commute of the week. I've chosen Toronto's Zeus and their song Are You Gonna Waste My Time?\n\nI highly suggest you watch the video, especially if you like edible puppets and dogs.\n\n\n\nHave a great day!\n\nIf you have a traffic or commuter gripe about driving, cycling or being a pedestrian commuter \u2014 anything from problem intersections, to parking, to inefficient routes \u2014 send it to doug.hempstead@cbc.ca.\n\nAnd remember, you can share what you see on the roads with me on Twitter at @cbcotttraffic.
