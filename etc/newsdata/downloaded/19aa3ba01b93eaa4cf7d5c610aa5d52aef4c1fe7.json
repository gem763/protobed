He dropped very deep, sometimes so deep he became a third centre back, to take possession and help the ball progress up field.\n\nHowever, it didn't take long for teams to either man-mark him out of the game or shut down his passing options, forcing centre backs or the goalkeeper to play a long pass that would render him useless.\n\nIf he was allowed time on the ball, Jorginho was then criticised for playing too many safe passes or taking too much care with the ball and therefore slow build-up play became a glitch in Sarri's system.\n\nDespite winning the Europa League and securing a top-four finish, Sarri was axed and Jorginho probably felt he would be cut adrift too. But just two months into the new season the Italian is playing a crucial role in Frank Lampard's rejuvenation of the club.\n\nThe 27-year-old is flourishing under the direction of his new manager, who is giving him a license to cut loose and play more direct.\n\nIn the first seven games of the new Premier League season Jorginho has played 594 minutes, the most of any Chelsea midfielder, and this new front-foot style is bringing obvious statistical improvements.\n\nFollowing Sarri's departure he is now flourishing in the new-look and youthful Chelsea side\n\nFrank Lampard has allowed Jorginho to play more direct and is certainly reaping the rewards\n\nStats show that Jorginho has massively improved when compared to his team-mates this year\n\nHe failed to register a single assist under Sarri but has already got one this campaign. He also has one goal after seven games when he managed just two all season in 2018-19. Chances created have also risen from 0.85 per game to 1.4.\n\nMost interestingly though it is the passing statistics, a key asset of his game that made Sarri bring him to west London, that illustrate the difference in Jorginho's performances.\n\nUnder Sarri he chalked up 88.7 passes per 90 minutes, whereas now he is managing 70.9. That seems to suggest he has ditched the conservative passes that frustrated fans and slowed attacks.\n\nHe is also averaging 86.1 touches in matches since Lampard took over in the summer, a drop from 101 under Sarri. This highlights the fact he is spending less time on the ball but making the most of when he does have it.\n\nPasses in the opposition's half are also down from 53 to 38.3, suggesting he is no longer working his way into the attacking area of the pitch but rather starting attacks quicker from deeper positions.\n\nBefore Sarri's arrival N'Golo Kante was flourishing in his role as a ball-winning midfielder, just as he had done for Leicester in their famous title win. Jorginho's role forced Sarri to move the Frenchman to a box-to-box player and that left Kante uncomfortable.\n\nThe former Napoli playmaker is also performing on a level similar to the Premier League's best\n\nHis 16 interceptions are significantly higher than Liverpool's Fabinho (7) and City's Rodri (5)\n\nJorginho averaged the same amount of tackles and more interceptions than Kante last season, which is remarkable given the latter is the best in the world at what he does.\n\nLampard's introduction has seen the Italian maintain his combative approach though. His tackles per 90 mins are up from 2.2 to 2.7, his interceptions have risen from 1.8 to 24 and his fouls conceded are also up from 0.94 to 1.1 per game.\n\nAfter an underwhelming start to life in England, Jorginho is now also playing on a similar level to the Premier League's best holding midfielders.\n\nHis 16 interceptions are significantly higher than Fabinho (7) and Rodri (5) and has also created two more clear chances than the Liverpool and Manchester City duo.\n\nHe boasts a higher tackle success rate than the pair and has recovered the ball at least 10 times more.\n\nSpeaking after the 2-0 victory over Brighton, Jorginho was fully aware of the change in his role. He said: 'He (Lampard) wants more forward, not too much short passing, so I am trying to do that. I think it is going good.'\n\nHis manager must be delighted with Jorginho's performances so far and he has clearly shown 'Sarri-ball' was the problem, not the players trying to make sense of it.", "description": "THE NUMBERS GAME - MAX WINTERS: Just two months into the season the Italian is playing a crucial role in Frank Lampard's rejuvenation of the club after struggling under Maurizio Sarri.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/10/19290346-0-image-a-66_1570180985426.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
