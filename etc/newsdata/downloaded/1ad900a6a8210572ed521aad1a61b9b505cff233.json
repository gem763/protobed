I have to admit reality and it was very obvious but I knew I would take my chance if there was another change. There is a change now.\u201d\n\nProdl had initially been a regular starter under Gracia, who took over in January 2018, before completely going off the radar the following season.\n\nDiscussing Gracia, Prodl said: \u201cIt\u2019s history, let it be history. Maybe there will be a book one day.\n\n\u201cIt is the wrong time and we are in a situation where we have to look forward and push to get better results, more points and maintain our status in the Premier League.\u201d", "description": "Sebastian Prodl believes there is a \u201cmuch better\u201d atmosphere at Watford, having finally been recalled following a fall-out with the previous head coach.", "authors": ["Arindam Rej", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000157132549-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqvd2GpBDTfVl0iEHth075h8g5q4QfzjEw3N4wWh2awno.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
