It included rare silver bracelets and brooches, a gold ring, a bird-shaped gold pin and an enameled Christian cross.\n\n\"I unearthed the first piece, initially I didn't understand what I had found because I thought it was a silver spoon and then I turned it over and wiped my thumb across it and I saw the Saltire-type of design and knew instantly it was Viking,\" McLennan told the BBC at the time of the discovery.\n\nFiona Hyslop, the Scottish culture secretary, noted that the Galloway Hoard \"is one of the most important collections ever discovered in Scotland,\" and \"opens a window on a significant period in the history of Scotland,\" according to National Museums Scotland\n\nStuart Campbell, head of Scotland's treasure unit, told the Guardian : \"What makes this find so significant is the range of material from different countries and cultures. This was material that was buried for safekeeping, almost like a safety deposit box that was never claimed.\"\n\nTreasures from the Galloway Hoard are displayed at the National Museums of Scotland on October 26, 2017 in Edinburgh.

I don't understand why he would, it is not a thing that can be avoided.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to McLennan for comment.\n\nChurch trustees subsequently lodged legal action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh against McLennan, claiming the church is entitled to an equal share of the proceeds.\n\n\"It can be confirmed the general trustees of the Church of Scotland have raised an action against Derek McLennan,\" a spokesman for the church said, according to the UK's Press Association.\n\n\"As that is now a matter before the court, it would be inappropriate for us to provide any further commentary at this time.\"", "description": "The Church of Scotland is suing a man for a share of a $2.5 million Viking treasure trove he discovered with a metal detector on church land in 2014.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190915171246-viking-3-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
