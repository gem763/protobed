Mitt Romney (R-Utah) declared, \u201cIt\u2019s absurd, disgusting, and way off the mark. This is a decorated American soldier and he should be given the respect that his service to our country demands.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat is all well and good, but where have they been in denouncing President Trump\u2019s equally loathsome tactics? Trump was calling out Vindman as a NeverTrumper (who he says are \u201chuman scum\u201d):\n\nAD\n\nSupposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call \u201cconcerned\u201d today\u2019s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nRepublicans did not stand up to Trump when he attacked then-Sen. John McCain in 2015 (\u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured.\u201d). They did not call him out when Trump in a meeting with lawmakers argued former defense secretary Jim Mattis is \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d and wasn\u2019t \u201ctough enough.\u201d And let\u2019s not forget he repeatedly questioned the ethics of ex-Marine Robert S. Mueller III with specious claims of conflicts of interest and waged a nonstop campaign of vitriol against former director of national intelligence and retired Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper Jr.\n\nIt\u2019s not just military men and women that Trump impugns. He has bludgeoned the FBI, persecuted deputy attorney general Andrew McCabe (firing him and depriving him of his pension, while dangling a criminal indictment over his head), sided with Vladimir Putin against the intelligence agencies and launched a criminal investigation of those investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Far from condemning such tactics, Republicans have gleefully joined in these attacks. Where was their concern for these patriots who also devote their lives to our national security?\n\nAD\n\nThe government-wide smear of the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 that is, those men and women who take seriously their oath to the Constitution and do not confuse that loyalty with loyalty to Trump \u2014 is also an attack on the patriotism and loyalty of fellow Americans. This is now an essential aspect of right-wing conspiracy theories and regular nomenclature among Republicans.\n\nAD\n\nIt is not just military service personnel who deserve our respect, but any Foreign Service officer, civilian Pentagon worker, law enforcement officer and, yes, even members of Congress. Trump, however, sees no difference between disloyalty to him (meaning any deviation from the cult and willingness to say anything in Trump\u2019s defense) and disloyalty to the country. He has characterized critical voices (the media being the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d) and adverse witnesses including the whistleblower as traitors. All of this has not weakened his grip on the Republican Party.\n\nThey\u2019ve created the monster who exceed the bounds of decency, civility and respectability. They\u2019ve shrugged off his tweets and excused his vindictive language time and again. Through it all, the vast majority of the Republican Party has tolerated if not shared in the nonstop slander of fellow Americans. Only when the \u201coptics\u201d of attacking Lt. Col. Vindman threatened to derail their attacks on the impeachment process did they feel compelled to come forward. Their toleration and enabling of Trump is no less shameful than attacks on Vindman or Trump\u2019s attacks on honorable men and women who dedicate their lives to serving America.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Republicans' selective outrage means Trump escapes condemnation.", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/inW7f_j9zscGgtNXsSzwg8JJfQ0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZZTE6DH2LQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
