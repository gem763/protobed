Kalil House after the original owner, a radiologist, the house is one of the seven Usonian Automatic houses Wright designed, according to Paula Martin of Keller Williams, who plans to list the property on Oct. 9.\n\n\n\nOne of the other six Usonian Automatic houses is the Zimmerman House, which is just two doors down from the Kalil House and is now owned by the Currier Museum of Art. The other five are located in Washington, Arizona, Ohio, Missouri and Michigan.\n\nWright-designed Usonian houses have no attics, no basements, and little ornamentation, and the Usonian Automatic house is a style made of inexpensive concrete blocks.\n\n\n\nWright designed the modular style of concrete-block houses in hope that post-war Americans could follow the designs and build versions themselves at a low cost.\n\n\n\nMore: Frank Lloyd Wright Homes Take Longer to Sell, But the Right Buyer Will Pay a Premium\n\nBuilt from 1955-\u201957, Toufic H. Kalil House has a master suite with his-and-hers closets, as well as a built-in dressing area, a guest room, a den, and an open living room featuring a sunken fireplace, Ms. Martin said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe house enjoys many classic Wright features, including rich Philippine mahogany paneling, signature Cherokee Red concrete floor with radiant heat, and many original pieces of furniture,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the whole rear features glass windows allow soft, natural light to filter into the house and showcases beautiful views of the private backyard from the living room, Ms. Martin said.\n\n\n\nThe property, sitting on approximately three-quarters of an acre of land, also has a 265-square-foot studio that can be transformed into a guest house or office, Ms. Martin said.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta Art by Women Remains Underrepresented\n\nUpon his death, Kalil bequeathed the house to his brother, John, who died last year at age 101, Ms. Martin said. Heirs to the family spent over a year improving the house, including adding a new low-slope, commercial-grade modified bitumen roof, and replacing the back patio wall with an accurate duplication of original concrete blocks, according to Ms. Martin.\n\n\n\nLocated on the North End in Manchester, the property is a short drive to New Hampshire\u2019s mountains, its seacoast and airports, Ms. Martin said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-109411?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
