It becomes possible to improve visibility by moving figures and illustrations, according to Mitsubishi Electric. In addition, displayed contents can be easily changed. So, it is possible to change traffic lines in accordance with the flow of actual people on the day of the event.\n\nThe Dynamic Sign is suited for (1) arenas where various events such as concerts and sports take place and traffic lines change each time and (2) public facilities such as train stations where the flow of people changes in accordance with time of day.\n\nThe projector set up at the test site is a commercially-available product of another company. In a case made by Mitsubishi Electric, the short-focus projector is stored. The case was installed in places where a passageway branches and where visitors easily get lost such as near stairs and escalators.\n\nMoreover, a camera was placed near the case of the projector to verify the effects of the Dynamic Sign. Visitors' reactions to the Dynamic Sign and the directions of visitors' lines of sight are used for measurement.\n\nMitsubishi Electric is making efforts to make the Dynamic Sign an international standard. It already set up a working group in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\n\"We will standardize it in about three years,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://tech.nikkeibp.co.jp/en/index.html\n\n\u00a9 Nikkei x Tech", "description": "Mitsubishi Electric Corp has started to test Dynamic Sign, which smoothly guides people by using a projector to project images such as animated arrows, characters and figures on the floor of a passageway.
