Today it was extensively damaged by a bushfire in the Gold Coast hinterland. https://t.co/qSFUC9neQC pic.twitter.com/QN0JoD8sFm\n\nIts smouldering ruins are surrounded by the blackened remnants of what used to be lush rainforest in the Lamington National Park, west of the Gold Coast.\n\nThe fire remained out of control, and was burning towards the community of Numinbah Valley, north-east of Binna Burra.\n\nWater bombers were being used to subdue the blaze as ground crews desperately tried to get on top of the fire, which has so far consumed 11 homes.\n\nLocals were warned more properties could go, and livestock losses were expected to be significant.\n\nBut there has been some good news for residents further inland, in the Queensland border towns of Stanthorpe and Applethorpe where another major fire destroyed three homes and other property.\n\nThat blaze was finally burning within containment lines, with crews to work through the night in a desperate push to strengthen them so the fire doesn\u2019t get away again.\n\n\u2018Dead things everywhere\u2019: is Australia facing the summer from hell?

Current advice is to stay informed in case the situation worsens.\n\nQueensland Fire and Emergency Services\u2019 predictive services inspector, Andrew Sturgess, said the state had never before seen such serious bushfire conditions, so early in spring.\n\n\u201cSo this is an omen, if you will, a warning of the fire season that we are likely to see in south-eastern parts of the state where most of the population is,\u201d he said.\n\nThe acting premier, Jackie Trad, said climate change meant the state was facing a new era of fire risks.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that with an increasing temperature with climate change, then what the scientists tell us is that events such as these will be more frequent and they will be much more ferocious,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nFire authorities have warned the danger posed by the Binna Burra fire will not be over for days, with strong winds expected to persist until Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still very much in defensive mode,\u201d Queensland Fire and Emergency Services\u2019 assistant commissioner, Kevin Walsh, said on Sunday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Canungra fire evacuee is comforted outside Moriarty Park Hall where they attended a community meeting about the fires in the region.

It\u2019s a bit surreal,\u201d Jason Nelson said after going home to Witheron, south of Canungra.\n\nThe Stanthorpe woman Samantha Wantling says the tension in the town is palpable, despite the news that fire crews have contained the blaze near the town.\n\nShe says locals are used to bushfires, but the speed of the one that hit on Friday night and how close it came to the heart of the town was terrifying.\n\nShe is fearful about the months that lie ahead, given the severity of the drought on the Granite Belt.\n\nDams and water tanks on rural properties are empty. Stanthorpe itself is subject to emergency water restrictions of 100 litres per person per day, with the supply not expected to last until the end of the year. After that the council will have to truck water in.\n\n\u201cWe need rain. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s going to save us,\u201d Wantling said.\n\nResidents warned to seek shelter as bushfires burn near towns in NSW and Queensland Read more\n\nIn New South Wales firefighters were battling several out-of-control bushfires with strong winds making for challenging conditions. Despite cooler weather, damaging winds of up to 70km/h were expected to ramp up fire activity with very high fire danger in the state\u2019s far north coast, north coast and New England areas.\n\nFirefighting efforts on Sunday were focused on two out-of-control blazes at Bees Nest in Armidale and Long Gully Road in Drake, east of Tenterfield, which were both at watch-and-act alert level. A large spot fire was also burning in Muldiva state forest with crews working to slow its spread. A third out-of-control blaze in Shark Creek on the north coast was raised to watch-and-act alert level about 11am on Sunday.\n\nA number of homes have been lost or damaged by fires since Friday. A 66-year-old volunteer firefighter was hospitalised on Friday after his hands, arm, legs, back, face and airways were burned while he and a colleague fought a fire at Mount Mackenzie Road, south of Tenterfield.
