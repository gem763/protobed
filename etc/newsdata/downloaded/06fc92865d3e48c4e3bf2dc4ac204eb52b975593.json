(PCG) fell nearly 8% to $7.58 as its blackout continues.\n\nThe company on Wednesday began shutting off power to 179,000 customers in 17 California counties, its second blackout this month meant to head off potential wildfires.\n\nThe bankrupt utility company cuts power when high winds that could knock down power lines and spark wildfires are predicted. The winds for Wednesday and Thursday were forecast as milder than those earlier this month that forced the utility to unplug 750,000 homes and businesses for as long as four days.\n\nWrite to Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 11:16 ET (15:16 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
