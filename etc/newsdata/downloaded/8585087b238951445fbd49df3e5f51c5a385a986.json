Collectively, Liberals, New Democrats and Greens won more than 55 percent of the vote.\n\nAD\n\nThis sent a message to the Conservatives: Pumping up anger in the base can win big majorities for the center-right in their strongholds but leave them stranded in metropolitan areas.\n\nAD\n\nScheer\u2019s Conservatives are up 26 seats but still at the wrong end of a 157-to-121 Liberal margin in the House of Commons. Given Trudeau\u2019s mistakes, this was an election the Conservatives could have won. They failed in a revealing way. Their popular-vote margin was built by huge victories in the prairie, energy-producing provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, where Conservatives already held most of the seats.\n\nBut Scheer\u2019s social conservatism and his opposition to Trudeau\u2019s carbon tax went down very badly elsewhere, holding back his party\u2019s gains in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes.\n\nAD\n\nOne large piece of good news: Wonderfully moderate Canada rejected Maxime Bernier\u2019s far-right breakaway People\u2019s Party. Bernier, who proudly answers to the nickname \u201cMad Max,\u201d lost his own seat, and his party got less than 2 percent of the vote. And in another blow to the right, Scheer was hurt in Ontario by the plunging popularity of the province\u2019s right-wing populist premier Doug Ford, who is often compared to President Trump.\n\nAD\n\nThe Angus Reid Institute found a strong negative connection between Ford\u2019s approach and national Conservatives. Just under half of the Ontario electorate said Ford\u2019s policies would influence their national votes, and 85 percent of those voters said this would push them away from the Conservatives. Trudeau happily tied Ford to Scheer. It worked. In Toronto, the Liberals won every single seat.\n\nTrudeau is a complicated figure. He\u2019s telegenic, fresh, broadly progressive and, at 47, young. He surprised those who underrated him by sweeping to victory in 2015 on a brilliant, risk-taking campaign rooted in \u201chope and hard work.\u201d His signature pledge was to \u201csunny ways,\u201d an appealing homage to optimism coined by legendary Canadian politician Wilfrid Laurier.\n\nAD\n\nBut not all was sunny these past four years. Trudeau\u2019s youth sometimes translated as callowness, and his insular inner circle didn\u2019t challenge him enough. His administration was rocked by a scandal in which a former attorney general charged that Trudeau pressured her to drop the prosecution of a large Quebec-based company.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the campaign, Trudeau, who has made an embrace of a tolerant, open and multicultural Canada his calling card, was embarrassed when it was revealed that he wore blackface and brownface on several occasions when he was in his late teens and 20s.\n\nConservatives had hoped they could come into power on a split vote as progressives alienated from Trudeau scattered their ballots among the New Democrats (NDP), the Greens and, in Quebec, the resurgent nationalists of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Trudeau\u2019s warnings about the dangers of Conservative government stemmed the tide. They rallied support where his party needed it most.\n\nAD\n\nStill, the two stars of the campaign came from third parties. Jagmeet Singh of the NDP, a turban-wearing Sikh lawyer, is the first nonwhite leader of a major party. He proved effective in debates and lifted his party from what, a few months ago, looked like catastrophe. He salvaged 24 of the party\u2019s 39 seats, roughly doubling earlier expectations. Singh hopes to use Trudeau\u2019s need for allies to push the Liberals in a progressive direction on climate and health care.\n\nAD\n\nThe bulk of the NDP\u2019s losses came in Quebec, where a resurgent Bloc under Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, the night\u2019s biggest winner, more than tripled its share of seats, from 10 to 32. One disturbing subtext: The Bloc\u2019s newfound popularity was fed in part by support for a Quebec law banning some public servants from wearing religious garb or symbols, a statute being challenged in court by human rights groups.\n\nMinority government is not unusual in Canada. Neither are regional divisions, although they ran particularly deep this year. Trudeau has been given a second chance by a country that still, on the whole, welcomes progressive government. The discipline that his lack of a majority will impose may be exactly what he needs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Trudeau has a second chance \u2014 with a catch.", "authors": ["E.J.
