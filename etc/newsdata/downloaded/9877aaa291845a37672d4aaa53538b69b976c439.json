Nazanin Tabatabaee/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS\n\nIran, one of the traditional powerhouses of Asian football with a passionate fan-base, won their World Cup qualifying match against Cambodia 14-0 but the one-sided game will be remembered much more for the scenes in the stands.\n\nWaving flags, blowing vuvuzela plastic horns and displaying the team colours of red, green and white, over 3,000 women watched from a special women-only section in the Azadi Stadium.\n\nWomen have been banned from watching men\u2019s games in Iran since shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution with only a few exceptions made for small groups on rare occasions.\n\nBut under pressure from world soccer\u2019s governing body FIFA and women\u2019s rights campaigners, Iranian authorities earmarked tickets for women to watch Thursday\u2019s game.\n\nFIFA had sent a delegation to Tehran to ensure that women were allowed to attend the game following the death last month of Sahar Khodayari, who set herself on fire to protest against her arrest for trying to get into a match.\n\nDubbed \u201cBlue Girl\u201d online for her favorite team Esteghlal\u2019s colors, Khodayari had feared being jailed for six months by the Islamic Revolutionary Court for trying to enter a stadium dressed as a man.\n\nVideo footage of the crowd at Thursday\u2019s match, posted on twitter, showed some supporters chanting \u201cBlue Girl, Blue Girl\u201d. Other video showed supporters chanting \u201cFIFA, Thank You\u201d.\n\nEMOTIONAL CROWD\n\nWhile Iran\u2019s dominant performance ensured little drama on the field, there was no shortage of emotion in the crowd.\n\n\u201cWe have an incredible feeling as the first Iranian women entering the stadium,\u201d said one fan, interviewed by local television.\n\n\u201cInshallah from now on all of our friends will also be able to come. Because we had restrictions this is very appealing to us otherwise it\u2019s not something special,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother video interview, distributed on social media, showed a woman fan inside the stadium, on the brink of tears with an Iranian flag over her shoulders and painted on her face.\n\n\u201cIt was really a very big wish. Really, thank you for letting us come. I\u2019m shaking. Thank you,\u201d she said.\n\nSelling tickets for a women\u2019s only section has been criticized by some campaigners who would prefer women to be able to attend matches with their male family members.\n\nCampaigners also want to see women given access to all games, not just World Cup qualifiers which come under the direct responsibility of FIFA. Iranian women are not currently able to attend men\u2019s games in their domestic club league.\n\nSPARSELY ATTENDED\n\nThe game was sparsely attended but an extra area, next to the designated women\u2019s section, was opened for what appeared to be women who did not have tickets for the arranged area.\n\nAt the end of the game, the Iranian players ran over to the women\u2019s section to show their appreciation for their support.\n\nGovernment spokesman Ali Rabiei said he viewed the presence of women at the stadium as a positive step, according to the official IRNA news agency.\n\n\u201cThe government has a positive view of the presence of women in stadiums,\u201d Rabiei said.\n\n\u201cThe infrastructure of Azadi stadium is ready for the presence of women. But the cultural and mental infrastructure must be ready,\u201d he added\n\nWhile campaigners have welcomed women being granted access for Thursday\u2019s game, it is unclear if such scenes will become the norm in Iran.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has urged Iranian authorities to open up stadiums to women for all games, not just World Cup qualifiers.\n\nThe sport\u2019s global governing body sent officials to Tehran to monitor access for women at the match and said it will continue to press for their inclusion.\n\nInfantino issued a statement after Thursday\u2019s game saying the occasion had been a \u201cvery positive step forward\u201d.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\n\u201cThere can be no stopping or turning back now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe passion, joy and enthusiasm (the fans) showed today was remarkable to see and encourages us even more to continue the path we have started. History teaches us that progress comes in stages and this is just the beginning of a journey,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cConsequently, FIFA now looks more than ever towards a future when ALL girls and women wishing to attend football matches in IR Iran will be free to do so, and in a safe environment.\u201d\n\nThe FIFA president paid tribute to \u201call of the Iranian girls and women who courageously stood and are standing up for their rights. FIFA fully supports them and will stand by them.\u201d", "description": "Iranian women watched the country's national soccer team for the first time in 40 years on Thursday, celebrating their long-awaited access to the national stadium but also paying tribute to the 'Blue Girl' fan who died last month.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439331701&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991EQ", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
