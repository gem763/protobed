VUE competed with DirecTV, YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV and Sling with cable TV alternatives, offering viewers a cheaper way to get the channels they love, without having to rent cable boxes and DVRs.\n\n\"The highly competitive Pay TV industry, with expensive content and network deals, has been slower to change than we expected,\" Sony said in a blog post. \"Because of this, we have decided to remain focused on our core gaming business.\"\n\nMonday, AT&T said it lost nearly 200,000 subscribers to its AT&T Now (formerly DirecTV Now) streaming service, which looks to offer more affordable pay TV, with fewer cable channels for streamers who want to ditch cable.\n\nBut these packages have become more expensive, as rights holders demand more money for programming. YouTube TV, for instance, began in 2017 as a $35 monthly package, and is now $50 monthly, the same price as VUE after a recent price hike.\n\nIn December, when USA TODAY reviewed the top cable TV alternatives, YouTube TV was $40 monthly and VUE $44.95.\n\nFor folks looking to cut the cord and ditch cable, but still watch their favorite channels, this is not a good sign, as the industry looks to streaming channels instead to sell to consumers.\n\nFriday Apple's TV+ launches, followed by Disney + on Nov. 12 and in 2020 HBO Max and NBC's The Peacock.\n\nSling TV, price wise, is still the best bargain for consumers, starting at $25 monthly.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham", "description": "Cable TV alternative offered lower prices and more options but Sony blamed higher programming costs in announcing the decision to close down.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9ebb68b78547ebba3c4684c7145e11bbb3b143d8/c=57-0-1863-1016/local/-/media/2019/10/29/USATODAY/usatsports/ps-vue-homepage-profiles-feature-01-us-05aug19.jpg?width=1806&height=1016&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
