The Aussie had revealed to the Bachelorette, Angie Kent, that he works as a councillor, but had ambitions to run for mayor.\n\nIn a statement, the current Mayor of Noosa, Tony Wellington, said that Glasgow\u2019s appearance on the series was not \u2018reflective of Noosa Council, nor the wider community\u2019s values\u2019.\n\nThe contestant made waves during his appearence on the show\u2019s premiere episode (Picture: Ten)\n\n\u2018Cr Glasgow did not seek approval from myself and I only found out about his involvement after the show had been recorded,\u2019 the Mayor said according to news.com.au.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe councillor has already made a pretty solid first impression \u2013 as a classic reality TV villain. In the premiere episode, he revealed his lack of interest in spending time with the Bachelorette and said that, if offered the 24-hour rose, he would decline it.\n\nGlasgow is now, however, making headlines for his conduct both in and out of the show. In an interview with Australian media personality Ben Fordham, Mayor Wellington also confirmed that Glasgow\u2019s case will be referred to the Office Of The Independent Assessor.\n\nIf you thought the councillor from Noosa was \u201cunusual\u201d on \u2018The Bachelorette\u2019 last night.. so did the Mayor ! pic.twitter.com/k1HMfZynvC \u2014 Ben Fordham (@BenFordham) October 10, 2019\n\nIn a separate interview with Sunshine Coast Daily, the contestant and councillor disputed the Mayor\u2019s claims and said he had \u2018approval and support\u2019 to enter the dating competition.\n\n\u2018I do not think I brought Noosa Council or Noosa into disrepute,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s reality television. I did not say anything with malice or anything that was disrespectful.\u2019\n\nIt seems as if the Aussie version of the show is just as drama-packed as its American cousin, but we\u2019re betting nothing could ever beat the intense drama of this year\u2019s Bachelorette finale in the States.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
