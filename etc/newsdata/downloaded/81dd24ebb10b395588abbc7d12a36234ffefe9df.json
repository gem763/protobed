Los Angeles and Las Vegas don\u2019t play until Sunday against the winners of Wednesday night\u2019s games.\n\nThe first round, single elimination round matches Chicago welcoming Phoenix, and Seattle hosting Minnesota.\n\nThe Mercury will head into the Windy City short-handed as they will most likely be without Diana Taurasi. Phoenix\u2019s star guard has missed most of the season with back and hamstring injuries. She\u2019s listed as doubtful for the opening game.\n\n\u201cHopefully we can win and get her ready for Sunday,\u201d Mercury coach Sandy Brondello said on Tuesday. \u201cBut at this stage, I don\u2019t envision Diana playing.\u201d\n\nTaurasi has been the ultimate competitor in do-or-die WNBA playoff elimination games, going 13-1 in her career, with her lone loss coming against Seattle in the semifinals last season. The Mercury have gone 6-0 in the single elimination format since the WNBA first introduced it in 2016. Phoenix is used to playing without Taurasi this season, and Brittney Griner and DeWanna Bonner have had outstanding seasons, as well as guard Leilani Mitchell.\n\nChicago is back in the playoffs for the first time since 2016. The Sky are led by guard Courtney Vandersloot, who became the first player in WNBA history to have 300 assists in a season. While experience is on the Mercury\u2019s side, the Sky have won all three games between the teams this season. That includes a 27-point win last week.\n\nIn the second game of the night, Minnesota will visit the defending champion Storm. Both teams have been a bit surprising this season considering the players they\u2019ve been missing. Seattle has played this season without reigning MVP Breanna Stewart, who has been out with a ruptured Achilles\u2019 tendon. The Storm have also been missing Sue Bird for the entire year after she had knee surgery in May.\n\nSeattle has found other players to step up in the absence of the two stars. Natasha Howard has had an incredible season, playing well at both ends of the court.\n\nMinnesota coach Cheryl Reeve had to find a way to restructure the franchise after four key pieces to the Lynx\u2019s dynasty were missing. Lindsay Whalen retired, Rebekkah Brunson sat out because of a concussion and Maya Moore decided to take the year off. Add to that Seimone Augustus missed the first half of the season while recovering from knee surgery and Reeve had a mostly new roster this season.\n\nThe one mainstay from the championship run was center Sylvia Fowles, who had another strong season. She was complemented by first-round pick Napheesa Collier, who is a leading candidate for rookie of the year.\n\nHere are a few things to watch for in the playoffs:\n\nRESTING TIME: Washington and Connecticut will have time to heal up and be ready for the semifinals. For the Mystics, it\u2019s a chance to get a few more days for Kristi Toliver to recover from a bone bruise that has sidelined her for the last few weeks. For the Sun, it\u2019s a chance to play a best-of-five series in the playoffs instead of a single-elimination game in which the team hasn\u2019t fared well, losing the last two years to Phoenix.\n\nPLAYOFF NEWBIES: The Las Vegas Aces were the preseason pick by the WNBA\u2019s general managers and coaches to win the league this year. Coach Bill Laimbeer has said all along it\u2019s a three-year plan for the team and this is just the second year. The Aces earned a bye on the final day of the regular season and have the talent to make a deep playoff run. They are led by the dominant front court of A\u2019ja Wilson and Liz Cambage.\n\nROUNDING INTO FORM: The Los Angeles Sparks have been nearly unbeatable at home this season, winning 15 of 17 contests. With Candace Parker, Chelsea Gray and the Ogwumike sisters leading the way, the Sparks have playoff experience and depth. The key though might be the play of Riquna Williams. Los Angeles\u2018 guard was suspended for 10 games because of a domestic violence arrest. She provides the team with a consistent outside shooting presence and has the ability to create her own shot.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug Feinberg on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After a wild regular season, the WNBA postseason gets underway with a pair of first-round games.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Feinberg"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
