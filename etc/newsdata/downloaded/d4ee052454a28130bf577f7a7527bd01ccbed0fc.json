As Daniels was brought down, his leg was pinned underneath awkwardly and he immediately grabbed his knee. Daniels needed help to get off the field and was later carted into the locker room. He came out for the second half on crutches and wearing street clothes.\n\nUSC quarterback JT Daniels is carted off the field after being injured during the first half against Fresno State.

Before the injury, Daniels completed 25-of-34 passes for 214 yards, one touchdown and one interception.\n\nSlovis went 6-of-8 for 57 yards and an interception in his college debut. A three-star recruit from Arizona, Slovis beat out last year\u2019s backups Matt Fink and Jack Sears for the No. 2 spot on the depth chart. Sears announced on Tuesday that he would put his name into the transfer portal.\n\nSaturday night\u2019s game was USC\u2019s first with new offensive coordinator Graham Harrell calling plays, and now the offense will move forward with Slovis as the starter.\n\nClay Helton: \"We will go ahead and get Kedon Slovis ready for the upcoming week. We've got all the confidence in his ability to move the offense. ... We have the utmost trust in his ability, and we look forward to watching him play on Saturday.\" \u2014 Greg Beacham (@gregbeacham) September 2, 2019\n\nBrutal news for Clay Helton\n\nStory continues\n\nUSC went 5-7 in 2018, marking the program\u2019s first season with a losing record since 2000. Many expected it to cost Helton his job, but Trojans athletic director Lynn Swann surprisingly brought him back while saying that changes needed to be made.\n\nThe first move Helton made was bringing in fired Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury as his offensive coordinator, but that changed when Kingsbury surprisingly got the Arizona Cardinals job. From there, Helton brought in Harrell to run the Air Raid \u2014 an offense that seemed like a really nice fit for a talent like Daniels.\n\nInstead, it will be an unheralded freshman in Slovis running the show with a brutal schedule in the coming weeks.\n\nNext week, the Trojans host No. 25 Stanford before traveling to BYU, hosting No. 14 Utah and then going on the road to face No. 13 Washington and No. 9 Notre Dame. That could prove to be too steep a hill to climb for Helton\u2019s program.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Daniels tore the ACL and meniscus in his right knee during Saturday\u2019s win over Fresno State.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/k9L1sSkLLYv_FJ.lfncqIg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WpIm9ECas_zP2uRE1PHVPw--~B/aD0yMzUxO3c9MzUyNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/99529570-cd1e-11e9-b1fd-e4e237a11a62"}
