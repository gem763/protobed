The former Coronation Street actress said all along that her goal was to reach the Halloween special but the fact that she\u2019s been outlasted in the contest by inferior dancers - mainly Mike Bushell and Chris Ramsey, who both average more than three points fewer per dance - still leaves a sour taste.\n\nSure, the cha cha cha simply wasn\u2019t her dance. Catherine struggled with the leg action all week in training and made too many mistakes for the judges to overlook. As a genuine beginner, however, she performed every routine whole-heartedly and was always watchable and hugely likeable.\n\nCatherine\u2019s hoofing highlights were her romantic Movie Week rumba to \u201cShallow\u201d from A Star Is Born, which appeared to be her breakthrough dance, followed by her \"action-packed pink explosion\u201d of a Charleston to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d. After this mini purple patch, twice scoring in the 30s, her form dipped over the past fortnight.\n\nCatherine departs the dancefloor three weeks earlier than her second cousin, cricketer Michael Vaughan, who competed in the 2012 series.\n\nStill, she developed great chemistry and an endearing friendship with pro partner Johannes Radebe. In true Strictly spirit, she has also vowed to keeeeeeeeep dancing.
