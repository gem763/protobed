(Shealah Craighead/The White House via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group who was killed in a U.S. military raid in Syria, according to President Donald Trump (all times local):\n\n4:15 p.m.\n\nThe Prescott, Arizona parents of slain American hostage Kayla Mueller say they have mixed emotions about the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nTheir daughter was a humanitarian aid worker who was kidnapped and taken hostage in August 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria.\n\nMueller's death was reported in February 2015 and U.S. intelligence officials told her family four months later that she was raped repeatedly by al-Baghdadi.\n\nCarl Mueller told The Arizona Republic on Sunday that al-Baghdadi \"either killed her or he was complicit in her murder.\"\n\nMarsha Mueller says she wants to know what truly happened to her daughter \"and what aren't we being told.\"\n\nKayla Mueller's body has yet to be recovered.\n\n___\n\n1:10 p.m.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is criticizing the White House for failing to notify congressional leaders before the U.S. raid in Syria that President Donald Trump says killed the leader of the Islamic State group.\n\nShe notes that the U.S. let Russia know the raid was in the works.\n\nTrump said U.S. military helicopters flew over territory controlled by Russian and Syrian forces before landing at Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's compound. He also said he kept lawmakers out of the loop because he was fearful of leaks.\n\nPelosi says the Trump administration must brief Congress on the operation and on the administration's overall strategy for the Mideast.\n\nBefore the 2011 raid in Pakistan that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, the Obama administration did give advance word to the top two Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate as well as the four leaders of the congressional intelligence committees.\n\n___\n\n12:45 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says European nations have been a \"tremendous disappointment\" in what he says is their unwillingness to bring home captured Islamic State fighters from their home countries.\n\nHe's renewing his threat to release imprisoned fighters at their borders.\n\nTrump has repeatedly and publicly pressed Europe to take back their large numbers of imprisoned fighters, but that push has been met by some resistance.\n\nThe U.S. has said it wants to lead by example and several captured fighters have been returned to America for prosecution.\n\n___\n\n12:40 p.m.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry is expressing skepticism about President Donald Trump's announcement that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed in a U.S. raid in Syria.\n\nThe ministry says in a statement that there were no recorded airstrikes in the Idlib zone on Saturday where the operation is said to have taken place.\n\nTrump said U.S. military helicopters flew over territory controlled by Russian and Syrian forces before landing at al-Baghdadi's compound.\n\nThe Russian statement says the ministry is unaware of \"any alleged assistance to the passage of American aircraft into the airspace of the Idlib de-escalation zone during this operation.\"\n\nIt also suggested that al-Baghdadi's presence in that area would be unlikely because the territory is controlled either by the Syrian government or by an al-Qaeda affiliate that is an IS rival.\n\n___\n\n12:15 p.m.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is disclosing more details about the U.S. military raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria.\n\nPence says that by Thursday afternoon, he and President Donald Trump learned that there was \"a high probability\" that al-Baghdadi would be at his compound in Syria's Idlib province.\n\nPence tells CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that Trump directed commanders to come up with military options and present them to him on Friday morning.\n\nPence says that by Saturday morning, \"we received the actionable intelligence\" that allowed the operation that Trump had approved to go ahead.\n\nAnd it was on Sunday morning when Trump told the nation that the raid had resulted in al-Baghdadi's death.\n\n___\n\n12:05 p.m.\n\nThe head of the foreign affairs committee in Russia's upper house of parliament says the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi would be welcome news, but he's playing down its possible impact in the fight against terrorism.", "description": "The Prescott, Arizona parents of slain American hostage Kayla Mueller say they have mixed emotions about the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
