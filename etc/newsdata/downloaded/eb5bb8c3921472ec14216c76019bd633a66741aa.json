Yet Mr. Zelensky has so far failed to win the backing of President Trump. Not only has Mr. Trump refused to grant the Ukrainian leader a White House visit, but also he has suspended the delivery of $250 million in U.S. military aid to a country still fighting Russian aggression in its eastern provinces.\n\nSome suspect Mr. Trump is once again catering to Mr. Putin, who is dedicated to undermining Ukrainian democracy and independence. But we\u2019re reliably told that the president has a second and more venal agenda: He is attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. Mr. Trump is not just soliciting Ukraine\u2019s help with his presidential campaign; he is using U.S. military aid the country desperately needs in an attempt to extort it.\n\nThe strong-arming of Mr. Zelensky was openly reported to the New York Times last month by Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said he had met in Madrid with a close associate of the Ukrainian leader and urged that the new government restart an investigation of Mr. Biden and his son. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, while Joe Biden, as vice president, urged the dismissal of Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, who investigated the firm.\n\nMr. Giuliani also wants a probe of claims that revelations of payments by a Ukrainian political party to Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, were part of a plot to wreck Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. In other words, Trump associates want the Ukrainian government to prove that Ukraine improperly acted against Mr. Trump in the 2016 election; but they also want it to meddle in his favor for 2020.\n\nMr. Zelensky is incapable of delivering on either demand. The revelations about Mr. Manafort came from a Ukrainian legislator who was fighting for domestic reform, not Hillary Clinton. And the Biden case, which has already been investigated by Ukrainian authorities, is bogus on its face. The former vice president was one of a host of senior Western officials who pressed for the dismissal of the prosecutor, who was accused of blocking anti-corruption measures.\n\nThe White House claims Mr. Trump suspended Ukraine\u2019s military aid in order for it be reviewed. But, as CNN reported, the Pentagon has already completed the study and recommended that the hold be lifted. Yet Mr. Trump has not yet acted. If his recalcitrance has a rationale, other than seeking to compel a foreign government to aid his reelection, the president has yet to reveal it.\n\nRead more:\n\nOliver Bullough: Why the alleged Joe Biden \u2018Ukraine conspiracy\u2019 doesn\u2019t hold up\n\nErik Wemple: New York Times, Bloomberg square off over Biden-Ukraine reporting\n\nPaul Waldman: Trump is already colluding with a foreign government to get reelected\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Ukraine has an extraordinary chance to turn things around\n\nMaksym Eristavi: Ukraine\u2019s new president needs to let his diplomats do their job", "description": "The administration is using suspended military aid to extort the reformist government.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VBQSUOWQC4I6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
