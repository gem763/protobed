In a video uploaded by the blog Passion Times and apparently taken after the initial confrontation, the man can be seen with blood running down his face and becoming increasingly agitated. Others can be heard telling him to sit down as he paces up and down the road then appears to lash out at a nearby protester. The man then topples over, at which point masked protesters set upon him, beating him with sticks and kicking him in the torso and head as he lies on the ground.\n\nThe man was treated on the scene by first aid volunteers and then taken to hospital by ambulance.\n\nAngry older men wielding meat cleavers are an occasional sideshow attraction in the Hong Kong protests. In early September such an individual attacked several protesters with a cleaver and stabbed a woman thought to have been his wife in the stomach when she tried to stop him. The man claimed he slashed the protesters to defend himself.\n\nMeat cleavers have occasionally been used by supporters of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments to destroy protest displays, especially the Post It-covered \u201cLennon walls\u201d they are fond of erecting.", "description": "An elderly man armed with a meat cleaver confronted protesters who were attempting to barricade a street in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/on-the-streets-of-hong-kong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
