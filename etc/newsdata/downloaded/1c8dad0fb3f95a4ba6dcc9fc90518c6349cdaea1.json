After reportedly welcoming her third child with Ryan Reynolds over the summer\u2014a sibling to Inez, 2, and James, 4\u2014the actor is now the matriarch of a fairly full nest. As such, it\u2019s only natural that Lively has cultivated a list of baby-oriented favorites, which she shared today on Amazon to the delight of new moms everywhere.\n\nIn keeping with the far-more-candid postpartum conversation that\u2019s entered the ether in recent years, Lively\u2019s picks include items for the human who did the actual birthing\u2014think Frida Mom\u2019s Labor and Delivery Gown or Lavanila\u2019s The Healthy Deodorant\u2014as well as books, bottles, and bath toys designed with newer additions in mind. The registry feels right on time, as while many mothers are prepped on what to expect whilst expecting, the post-pregnancy period (sometimes referred to as the fourth trimester) is a bit more opaque; having a list of tried-and-true essentials can only help parents ease into life with a tiny new roommate. \u201cI understand how overwhelming it is to be a new parent,\u201d says Lively. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t tell you is it never gets less overwhelming, but with each kid I do learn more.\u201d\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "Blake Lively partners with Amazon to create a registry of curated new-mom picks.", "authors": ["Calin Van Paris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dc3dj4aJPN5N0sVDEl.dYQ--~B/aD0yNjAzO3c9MTgzMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/a9400ea923634162f107d72e93efcb9f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
