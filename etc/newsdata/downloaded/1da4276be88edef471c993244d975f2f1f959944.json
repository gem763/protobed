Put simply: a commissioner denied is a Commission delayed. We\u2019ll get to the question of whether it was poetic justice, sweet revenge or something else in a moment. Mostly, it\u2019s a mess.\n\nFirst, a quick recap of a tumultuous Thursday: MEPs overwhelmingly rejected Sylvie Goulard, the French nominee to be commissioner for the EU\u2019s internal market and industrial policy, including the defense and space sectors, after Goulard failed in two separate hearings to sufficiently explain allegations of financial misconduct, and a very high-paid consulting position with a U.S.-based think thank for which she did little work. The vote, by secret ballot, wasn\u2019t even close: MEPs crushed her nomination 82 to 29.\n\nThat left von der Leyen 3 commissioners short of a full College (excluding the U.K.) \u2014 European Parliament previously rejected the Romanian and Hungarian nominees, also over ethical concerns. Adding to the mayhem, Romania\u2019s governing coalition collapsed Thursday, making it impossible to predict when Bucharest might put forward a new candidate. In any event, getting three replacements vetted and confirmed by Parliament won\u2019t happen in time for a plenary vote on the full College in Strasbourg the week after next. So, it now looks like the new Commission will take office the first week of December \u2014 at the earliest.\n\nThere\u2019s always a bright side: At least von der Leyen can take solace knowing she won\u2019t have to spend her first day as president in crisis mode if there\u2019s a no-deal Brexit on October 31. That joyous duty would fall to Jean-Claude Juncker, battle-scarred survivor of the Greek debt crisis and migration mess. (Don\u2019t forget, Juncker has promised to write Playbook on his last day in office, whenever that might be.)\n\nGOOD MORNING, I\u2019m David M. Herszenhorn, POLITICO\u2019s chief Brussels correspondent, filling in for Florian. And, with my colleagues Ma\u00efa de La Baume and Laura Kayali in Brussels, and Rym Momtaz in Paris, we have pulled together all the details for you about Goulard\u2019s doomed nomination here. Plus with our EU editor, Andrew Gray, we discuss Goulard on this week\u2019s EU Confidential podcast here.\n\nCONFIRMATION MAYHEM\n\nTHIS ONE\u2019S GONNA HURT: Goulard\u2019s rejection was a stinging betrayal of von der Leyen by her own conservative European People\u2019s Party (EPP), which led the charge against the French liberal nominee. But it also deeply embarrassed French President Emmanuel Macron, who quickly professed surprise and confusion over the outcome, and complained that von der Leyen had assured him Goulard had the support of Parliament\u2019s three main pro-EU political groups. The episode is a far more serious crisis for von der Leyen than it might initially seem, because it raises serious questions of trust among some of the EU\u2019s biggest power players.\n\nAwkward 1: Macron, seeming to duck blame for the debacle, said he had suggested three candidates to be French commissioner and it was von der Leyen who insisted on Goulard. (Video here.) He said von der Leyen assured him she had consulted with the group leaders \u2014 Manfred Weber of the EPP, Iratxe Garc\u00eda of the Socialists & Democrats and Dacian Ciolo\u0219 of her own Renew Europe. Garc\u00eda and Weber quickly issued statements denying they\u2019d been consulted about Goulard\u2019s candidacy in advance. And a spokesman for von der Leyen said he could neither confirm nor deny Macron\u2019s account. All of which means someone\u2019s taking liberties with the truth \u2026\n\nAwkward 2: Weber was the EPP\u2019s Spitzenkandidat (aka lead candidate), for the Commission presidency, but his bid was blocked by the liberal and social democrat leaders on the European Council, notably Macron. When German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other conservatives insisted the EPP keep the Commission presidency, the job went to von der Leyen. So by torpedoing Goulard\u2019s nomination, was Weber taking revenge? And, if so, was it on Macron? On von der Leyen? On Merkel? On all three, and the world? EPP insiders said Goulard was rejected on substance, making any vengeance coincidental. But was it any less sweet?\n\nAwkward 3: To put a twist on Tacitus, victory comes with 100 BFFs, but defeat is no one\u2019s friend. Von der Leyen and Goulard are reportedly pals, but the Commission president-elect issued a bland statement after Thursday\u2019s vote, expressing not one ounce of regret over Goulard\u2019s defeat. (Goulard, by contrast, issued a statement thanking von der Leyen for her confidence.) For sure, it probably didn\u2019t help that Goulard, flailing during her first hearing, resorted to lamely telling MEPs, \u201cI\u2019m clean!\u201d Still, von der Leyen at least could have thanked the failed nominees for their willingness to serve. She didn\u2019t.\n\nSeen another way, Goulard\u2019s defeat brought symmetry to the confirmation process, spilling liberal blood after Parliament rejected the Hungarian nominee, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, a conservative, and the Romanian nominee, Rovana Plumb, a social democrat.\n\nStill, the entire episode raised serious questions \u2026 about von der Leyen\u2019s leadership skills, given her silence throughout much of the confirmation process; about Macron\u2019s judgment, especially when it comes to personnel in Brussels; and about the prospects of finding and maintaining a majority coalition in what is now a far more diverse and divided European Parliament.\n\nThe fallout is likely to continue. In France, Macron\u2019s Renaissance delegation accused French MEPs from other parties of betraying Goulard. Even Italy\u2019s far-right former interior minister, Matteo Salvini, weighed in, calling Goulard\u2019s defeat \u201cgreat news.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Goulard? She seems likely to return to her previous job at the Bank of France.\n\n**A message from The Boeing Company: Trans-Atlantic industrial collaboration is vital to delivering excellence in aerospace, value to governments and capabilities to armed forces.

EU officials and diplomats were already bracing for a wild summit when EU national leaders gather next week in Brussels \u2014 largely because they expect to be ensnared in a tough conversation about Brexit.\n\nCould this be a breakthrough? Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson met in Thornton Hough on the Wirral, in northern England, on Thursday. Varadkar, who had been pessimistic about reaching a Brexit agreement, expressed new confidence that an accord was possible. Varadkar called the discussion \u201cvery positive and very promising,\u201d but it was unclear what Johnson might have said to make the Irishman so optimistic. EU ambassadors, meanwhile, will meet on Friday to discuss Brexit at around noon in Brussels. Cristina Gallardo and Charlie Cooper have more.\n\nBUT BREXIT ISN\u2019T THE ONLY ITEM ON THE EUCO AGENDA: The Finnish presidency of the Council of the European Union told EU ambassadors on Wednesday that it will circulate a new paper on the bloc\u2019s next long-term budget, known more formally as the multi-annual financial framework, three EU diplomats said.\n\nCheapskates: That announcement sparked anger as some in the room suspected the bottom level will still be a Hanseatic 1 percent of gross national income (GNI) \u2014 which, according to the Commission\u2019s position taken in the meeting, is \u201cextreme.\u201d The argument is that the budget proposal aims at streamlining the EU\u2019s spending and incorporates currently separate pots such as the European Development Fund. In short: Should Brexit not be enough to keep leaders engaged in a fight with one another, the big money questions are sure to spur debate and disputes. Bjarke Smith-Meyer and Hannah Brenton have the full details.\n\nSchool is in session: Commission President-elect von der Leyen is planning to attend the leaders\u2019 summit and could get her first, extremely uncomfortable and up-close look at what life will be like when her own native Germany, and her mentor, Angela Merkel, adopt positions that favor national interests over EU ones.\n\nIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD\n\nENLARGEMENT SNEAK PEEK: Commissioner for European Neighborhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations Johannes Hahn told reporters on Thursday that \u201con our side, on the Commission side, we are very clear \u2014 very clear \u2014 that we expect [a] green light for the opening of accession negotiations with both countries, North Macedonia and Albania.\u201d Hahn added: \u201cBoth countries have fulfilled their conditions, which were agreed unanimously by all EU member states in advance.\u201d\n\nWarning: Hahn, who is set to stay on in Brussels as the next budget and administration commissioner, urged EU governments who are hesitant about opening negotiations with the two countries to take into account the \u201cgeo-strategic element\u201d and warned that if the EU does not deliver in the western Balkans, it will lose credibility and others will fill the vacuum.\n\n**In our latest Changemakers article, we look at 5 people tackling aviation and shipping emissions \u2014 Check out POLITICO\u2019s guide to the individuals influencing efforts to cut the carbon footprint of planes and ships.**\n\nTRUMP WORLD, NOW FEATURING UKRAINE\n\nNO PRESSURE, NO BLACKMAIL, NOTHING TO SEE: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy held a marathon press conference on Thursday, during which he met with scores of journalists. He said he felt \u201cno pressure\u201d in his July phone call U.S. President Donald Trump, and insisted there was \u201cno blackmail.\u201d The call is at the center of an impeachment inquiry by Congress into whether Trump abused his office by asking the Ukrainians to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son.

As Maggie Severns writes, foreign efforts to influence Trump keep piling up.\n\nOPINION I \u2014 WOODY JOHNSON, PERSONA NON GRATA. In an op-ed for POLITICO, former British Ambassador Ivor Roberts explains what underpins diplomatic immunity, in the context of the case of Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a U.S. intelligence official who is a suspect in a fatal road crash in the U.K. Sacoolas\u2019 flight out of the U.K. \u201ccould not have occurred without the permission \u2014 perhaps even at the suggestion \u2014 of U.S. Ambassador Woody Johnson, a close friend and supporter of Trump,\u201d Roberts writes, suggesting that in return, London should label Johnson persona non grata.\n\nOPINION II \u2014 AS US RETREATS FROM MIDDLE EAST, EUROPE MUST STEP UP: Donald Trump\u2019s decision this week to provide a de-facto green light for another Turkish offensive into Kurdish-held territory in Northern Syria should serve as a shock that moves the EU to act, write Nathalie Tocci and Sinan Ekim in an op-ed for POLITICO.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkish forces have escalated their campaign in Syria.
