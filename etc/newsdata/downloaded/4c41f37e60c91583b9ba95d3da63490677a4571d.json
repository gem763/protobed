But in recent years the value of the franc has soared against the z\u0142oty, leaving many borrowers facing higher monthly repayments and often owing much more money than they originally borrowed.\n\nThe court's finding had mortgage holders celebrating while banks worried about a potential 60 billion z\u0142oty (\u20ac14 billion) hit to their bottom lines.\n\nAngry homeowners have started to sue banks, arguing that the loans were illegal under Polish law. Polish courts have returned widely varying verdicts, prompting a Warsaw court to turn to the CJEU.\n\nThe EU court ruled in the specific case of a borrower with a loan issued by Austria's Raiffeisen Bank. The court found that \"EU law does not preclude the annulment of those contracts,\" and that they can't be replaced by general Polish civil law clauses. That means the loans can be converted back to local currency.\n\nThe CJEU ruling is over a single case, and doesn\u2019t automatically force banks to convert the loans. However, it opens the door for borrowers to take their contracts to Polish courts, which could determine whether banks have to convert mortgages to z\u0142oty while keeping lower interest rates, or they could invalidate the loans. Consumers would have the final decision on whether to accept such new terms.\n\nPolish Finance Minister Jerzy Kwieci\u0144ski told reporters that the judgment strengthens the position of borrowers, who are often referred to as frankowicze.\n\n\u201cA lot will depend on the reasoning adopted by our courts,\u201d he said. It\u2019s unclear how many borrowers will end up suing. About 11,000 such cases have been filed, but their number is growing fast as borrowers see a chance of favorable court rulings.\n\nThe CJEU ruling opens the door for borrowers to take their contracts to Polish courts, which could determine whether banks have to convert mortgages to z\u0142oty while keeping lower interest rates.\n\nFinancial fallout\n\nKrzysztof Pietraszkiewicz, head of the Polish Banking Association, expressed hope that the impact of the ruling will be limited, otherwise some borrowers will be \u201cabsurdly privileged.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CJEU\u2019s judgment concerns only those mortgages that have been deemed abusive by the national court \u2026 not abusive in an abstract way, but abusive in a concrete contract, with all the documentation,\u201d he said at a press conference.\n\nThe travails of the foreign currency borrowers have long been an attractive target for politicians.\n\nIn Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n was faced with a similar situation, and cemented support for his Fidesz party among the country's middle classes by forcing banks in 2014 to switch franc loans to forint ones at rates very favorable to borrowers.\n\nPoland's previous Civic Platform government tried and failed to resolve the issue just before the 2015 election.\n\nAndrzej Duda promised to help such borrowers during his successful 2015 presidential campaign, a pledge that helped him gain traction in the larger cities that aren't big bases of support for his Law and Justice party. Once in office, the cost of a radical solution scared the government, and little was done.\n\nPoliticians jumped back into the fray on Thursday, hoping to get crucial support ahead of the October 13 parliamentary election.\n\nThe opposition Left coalition vowed to act on the issue after the election, to \"remove the noose from the necks\" of Swiss franc borrowers, said Wincenty Eisner, deputy head of the Democratic Left Alliance, one of the main parties in the coalition.\n\nGrzegorz Schetyna, leader of the opposition Civic Platform party, called the ruling a \"judgment\" against Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, a former banker, saying \"his bank was one of those that in a very offensive, optimistic way, dished out loans in Swiss francs.\u201d\n\nSchetyna also launched a broadside against Law and Justice for failing to follow through on its 2015 promises to help the frankowicze.\n\n\u201cThe CJEU\u2019s decision changes everything and shows how the Law and Justice government hasn\u2019t done anything in four years and hasn\u2019t undertaken any activity in this case,\u201d Schetyna added.\n\nMorawiecki's spokesperson called the accusations \"scandalous.\"\n\n\"It was Morawiecki who was directly pointing at dangers linked to Swiss franc mortgages ... In his bank, issuing such loans was marginal,\" he tweeted.", "description": "Mortgage holders rejoice while banks worry about a massive financial blow.", "authors": ["Zosia Wanat"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-146428112-1200x628.jpg"}
