Taylor Jr., the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified Tuesday that Trump wanted military aid to Ukraine linked to the country\u2019s willingness to investigate the 2016 election and former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfTrump made Ukraine aid contingent on a public pledge to investigate the Bidens and the 2016 election, U.S. envoy says he was told.\n\n\u25cfNew testimony undercuts Trump\u2019s claim of no quid pro quo on Ukraine. How will Washington respond?\n\n\u25cfProsecutors flagged possible ties between a Ukrainian gas tycoon and associates of Trump personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\n11:30 a.m.: Democrats decry Republican shutdown of testimony\n\nDemocrats decried the Republican shutdown of Wednesday\u2019s planned testimony by Cooper, dismissing it as a stunt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally inappropriate,\u201d said Rep. Harley Rouda (D-Calif.), who watched the episode unfold. \u201cWhen the facts are against you, when the law is against you \u2026 you\u2019re left arguing process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) called the Republicans\u2019 actions \u201ca violation of House rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t just crash into this,\u201d Lieu said.\n\n\u2014 Rachael Bade\n\n11 a.m.: House Republicans temporarily shut down impeachment proceedings with protest\n\nA group of House Republicans temporarily shut down the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, barging into a secure room where a witness was set to testify and refusing to leave despite orders from top Democrats.\n\nA group of about two-dozen Trump allies stormed a room in the Capitol basement where three investigative committees were supposed to hear testimony from Laura Cooper, the Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy. Those members were not on the committees of jurisdiction and were not supposed to be present during the closed-door deposition.\n\nAD\n\nA shouting match began between Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) and some Democrats in the room as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) left to consult with the sergeant at arms, according to Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who witnessed the entire episode.\n\nAD\n\nCooper was slated to begin testimony at 10 a.m. but was still being held in a private room off the secure area.\n\nThe protest was part of a Republican effort to change the narrative from the substance of the allegations against Trump to complaints about the process. Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to conduct a secretive takedown of the president by investigating behind closed doors; Democrats say, however, that they will open up the process for public hearings in a matter of weeks after they conduct their investigation.\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats are now looking at whether they will have to physically remove Republican members from the room. They may instead reschedule the deposition and have Capitol Police guard the doors to block entry.\n\nRepublicans broke the rules when they followed lawmakers into the locked facility and brought their phones into the secretive space. All electronics are barred from the secure area, which is meant for discussing highly sensitive or classified information.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Rachael Bade and Elise Viebeck\n\n10:30 a.m.: O\u2019Rourke decries Trump\u2019s comparison of impeachment to lynching\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke said Wednesday that Trump made the ultimate case for why he is not fit for office when he compared the impeachment proceedings to a lynching in a tweet this week.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you had not been convinced of how unfit he is to lead this country, his invocation of lynching to describe what is happening to him in a fair, deliberate, democratic process, that should convince you beyond a shadow of a doubt,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said at a Washington Post Live event Wednesday morning.\n\nO\u2019Rourke said that he was recently in Montgomery, Ala., and visited a memorial that has the name of every African American who was lynched at a time when terror was used \u201cto keep people down, through lynchings, through burnings, through drownings, through beatings.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo have the most privileged, the most powerful white man on the face of the planet invoke that same word to describe what is happening to him is one of the most obscene things that I\u2019ve heard in American life in my lifetime,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cAnd it goes to show the extent to which he will lie, the extent to which he will commit these obscenities.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Jenna Johnson\n\n10:15 a.m.: Schiff chides Trump about presidential powers\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat leading the impeachment inquiry, took aim at Trump in a tweet about things the president has recently said about his powers.\n\n\u201cThe emoluments clause isn\u2019t \u2018phony\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s in the Constitution,\u201d Schiff tweeted. \u201cHe is not \u2018in charge of the Hatch Act.\u2019 It\u2019s been the law since 1939, to prevent federal employees from using their offices for partisan activities. President Trump is not above the law.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump referred to the emoluments clause as \u201cphony\u201d Monday as he sought to justify his now-abandoned decision to hold a gathering of international leaders at a golf resort he owns in Florida. The emoluments clause prevents presidents from enriching themselves while in office.\n\nAD\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that, ahead of a June campaign rally in Orlando, Trump pushed to bring members of his Cabinet along but was rebuffed by acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who cautioned about potential violations of the Hatch Act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge of the Hatch Act,\u201d Trump told Mulvaney in a room full of other top aides, according to the Journal\u2019s account.\n\n10:10 a.m.: Conservative lawmakers attempt to enter classified area\n\nBefore Cooper was scheduled to begin speaking to lawmakers, about two dozen conservative Republican lawmakers led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) gathered around the classified area where depositions are being held to protest what they described as Democrats\u2019 secretive approach to the inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeveral in the group accused Democratic leaders of trying to undo the 2016 election result, rallying behind a talking point promoted by House GOP leaders.\n\nThe group walked into the restricted area en masse, and chants of \u201cLet us in\u201d were heard from outside the doors.\n\nWithin five minutes, several members of the group who do not sit on committees involved in the inquiry walked out, saying they were not allowed to enter the deposition.\n\nThe demonstration was the second attempt by non-committee Republicans to gain access in two weeks.\n\n\u201cThey refused us once again,\u201d Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) said. \u201cThis is an outrage.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Elise Viebeck\n\n9:55 a.m.: Trump administration sought billions of dollars in cuts to programs aimed at fighting corruption in Ukraine\n\nThe Trump administration has sought repeatedly to cut foreign aid programs tasked with combating corruption in Ukraine and elsewhere overseas, White House budget documents show, despite recent claims from the president and his administration that they have been singularly concerned with fighting corruption in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nThose claims have come as the president and his administration sought to explain away a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump pressured his counterpart to open investigations into Biden and his son Hunter, and into a debunked conspiracy theory involving a hacked Democratic National Committee computer server.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Erica Werner\n\n9:40 a.m.: Cooper arrives for closed-door deposition\n\nCooper has arrived at the Capitol for testimony related to the White House\u2019s decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine.\n\n9:30 a.m.: Taylor testified Ukrainian official was aware military aid was being withheld\n\nSeveral Republicans, including Rep. John Ratcliffe (Tex.), are arguing that Ukrainians were unaware that U.S. military aid was being withheld and therefore Trump could not have offered a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d by asking for an investigation of the Bidens.\n\nAmid a spate of early morning tweets, Trump quoted Ratcliffe on that point, writing, \u201cNeither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Taylor said in his opening statement Wednesday that a Ukrainian official was aware of the link.\n\nTaylor told House investigators that Tim Morrison, a National Security Council adviser on Russia, described a conversation between Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation,\u201d Taylor said, referring to the Ukrainian gas company that employed Hunter Biden.\n\n8:45 a.m.: Giuliani associates due in court on campaign finance violation charges\n\nTwo indicted associates of Giuliani are due to appear in federal court Wednesday to enter expected not guilty pleas to charges they violated campaign finance law and conspired to use foreign money to buy political influence.\n\nIgor Fruman and Lev Parnas \u2014 two Soviet-born emigres who hired the president\u2019s lawyer and then helped him investigate Biden \u2014 are charged in a case that has also led federal investigators to scrutinize Giuliani\u2019s interactions with the pair.\n\nFruman and Parnas were charged in an indictment earlier this month with conspiracy and with making false statements to the Federal Election Commission about political donations.\n\nTwo of their co-defendants, David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, pleaded not guilty last week in Manhattan federal court.\n\n\u2014 Renae Merle and Devlin Barrett\n\n8 a.m.: Pentagon official to testify about withheld aid to Ukraine\n\nThe Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy is scheduled to testify Wednesday in the House impeachment inquiry, raising the possibility of fresh revelations one day after a key diplomat undercut Trump\u2019s denial of a quid pro quo involving military aid.\n\nCooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense, will appear in a closed-door session on Capitol Hill, where she is expected to answer questions about the mechanics of U.S. security assistance for Ukraine and the fallout from the White House\u2019s decision to withhold it for several months over the summer.\n\nA career bureaucrat who has served in the Pentagon since 2001, Cooper is unlikely to have had many interactions with the president or his inner circle, but she would have played a role in overseeing much of the roughly $391 million in aid at issue in the probe.\n\nCooper is likely to have firsthand knowledge of an assessment described by Taylor and conducted by the Pentagon that gauged the effectiveness of U.S. aid to Ukraine after it was put on hold. The effort led to a recommendation that the aid be reinstated.\n\nCooper is also expected to detail interagency meetings in which senior officials discussed the need for aid and the best ways to convince Trump to resume it. The White House released the funds in September under bipartisan pressure from lawmakers.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Elise Viebeck\n\n7:45 a.m.: Charlie Dent chides fellow Republicans defending Trump\n\nIn a television interview, former Republican congressman Charlie Dent (Pa.) chided members of his party who are continuing to defend Trump\u2019s actions regarding Ukraine.\n\n\u201cPeople ask me why I push back against this administration and the president,\u201d he said during an appearance on CNN. \u201cBecause my nose is not a heat-seeking missile for the president\u2019s backside. People have to stand up and say and talk clearly to the American people. This is wrong. I mean, you cannot use your official resources of the government to investigate your political opponent.\u201d\n\n7:30 a.m.: Trump lashes out again at \u2018terrible\u2019 Democrats\n\nTrump lashed out at Democrats in a spate of tweets and retweets that stretched past midnight, with many focusing on the fact that Democrats are conducting depositions during the impeachment inquiry behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cThe Witch Hunt continues!\u201d Trump said in one tweet in which he shared House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) accusing Democrats of \u201cusing shady backroom tactics completely out of the public eye.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democrats Scam goes on and on! They Do Nothing!\u201d Trump said in another tweet in which he shared Rep. Robert B. Aderholt (R-Ala.) complaining that the \u201cimpeachment process is literally being conducted in the basement of the Capitol, behind closed doors\u201d and calling it \u201ca mockery.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet of his own, Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.) characterized Trump\u2019s missives as \u201crage-tweeting at midnight.\u201d\n\nTrump returned to Twitter shortly before dawn on Wednesday, picking up where he left off.\n\n\u201cIt never ends. The Do Nothing Dems are terrible!\u201d he said in one tweet.\n\nIn another, he asked, \u201cWhere is the Whistleblower?\u201d and asserted, \u201cThe Do Nothing Dems case is DEAD!\u201d\n\nTrump then retweeted an assessement by former acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker: \u201cThis #impeachment is not a constitutional process but an unprecedented #Democrat attack on a #Republican @POTUS\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders have likened this stage of the impeachment inquiry to grand jury proceedings and have said they are conducting depositions behind closed doors so that witnesses are less likely to be aware of one another\u2019s testimony.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans and their staff have participated in the questioning.\n\nDemocrats have said it may no longer be necessary for the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the inquiry to testify given firsthand witnesses who are corroborating what he relayed.\n\n7:25 a.m.: Swalwell says Trump is getting \u2018a fairer trial than he deserves\u2019\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday that Congress would give Trump \u201ca fairer trial than he deserves.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Swalwell vouched for the credibility of Taylor after having witnessed his testimony on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe had unimpeachable credibility and a detailed recall of the events that had happened,\u201d Swalwell said.\n\nHe was then asked if what he heard amounts to an impeachable offense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give the president a fairer trial than he deserves,\u201d Swalwell said. \u201cIf this was Donald Trump justice, he\u2019d be impeached by now. In America, even people who confess to crimes get a fair process.\u201d\n\n7:20 a.m.: Trump presides over a coarsening of American politics\n\nTrump unleashed a gusher of foul language, referring to himself as a \u201cson of a bitch,\u201d claiming that Biden was a good vice president only because \u201che understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass,\u201d and saying \u201chell\u201d 18 times \u2014 and that was all in a single campaign rally.\n\nAt another rally the following night, Trump denigrated Biden\u2019s son Hunter for his struggles with substance abuse and called him a \u201closer,\u201d while also declaring that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u201chates the United States of America.\u201d\n\nAnd just this week, Trump declared that the House impeachment inquiry was a \u201clynching\u201d \u2014 equating his political troubles with the systematic murders of African Americans by racist white mobs.\n\nTrump, who long ago busted traditional standards for civil discourse and presidential behavior, has taken his harsh rhetoric and divisive tactics to a new level since impeachment proceedings began a month ago \u2014 and he appears to be pulling a significant part of the country along with him.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker\n\n6 a.m.: Majority says Trump pursued personal interests, not national interests, in Ukraine\n\nA solid majority of registered voters believe Trump was pursuing his own personal interest in his dealings with Ukraine rather than the national interest, according to a new poll that also showed growing support for the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn the Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, 59 percent say Trump was pursuing his own personal interest, while 33 percent say he was pursuing the national interest.\n\nIn the poll, 55 percent voiced support for the impeachment inquiry, the highest level recorded in Quinnipiac surveys. Forty-three percent opposed the inquiry.\n\nThe poll showed that 48 percent of respondents support impeaching Trump and removing him from office, while 46 percent are opposed.\n\nIn other national polls conducted this month, support for removing Trump from office has ranged from 43 percent to 52 percent.\n\nIn the Quinnipiac poll, Trump\u2019s job approval rating dipped below 40 percent for the first time since the impeachment inquiry began.\n\nThirty-eight percent say they approve of the job he is doing, while 58 percent disapprove.\n\n5 a.m.: Pence attributes damaging testimony to \u2018the swamp\u2019\n\nVice President Pence blamed testimony damaging to Trump on \u201cthe swamp\u201d during an interview broadcast Tuesday night on Fox News.\n\nHis appearance followed a day of damaging testimony by Taylor, the latest in a succession of diplomatic officials who have appeared on Capitol Hill in defiance of orders from the leadership of the State Department.\n\n\u201cWhat can be done about that?\u201d asked host Laura Ingraham, who bemoaned \u201cthis permanent resistance trying to undo the results of an election.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have some extraordinary men and women in our diplomatic corps who know their work and who are strong and are out fighting for America\u2019s interest,\u201d Pence said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no question that when President Trump said we\u2019re going to drain the swamp, that an awful lot of the swamp has been caught up in the State Department bureaucracy, and we\u2019re just \u2014 we\u2019re just going to keep fighting it. And we\u2019re going to fight it with the truth.\u201d", "description": "The group of GOP representatives, who are not on the committees hearing the depositions, delayed closed-door testimony from Laura Cooper, the Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hx7r56xQO3r9LD6yEJNRB1Qg9jk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ML4M7GXR2AI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
