He\u2019s been an assistant coach on two of this generation\u2019s defining juggernauts \u2013 Pete Carroll\u2019s USC teams and Nick Saban\u2019s Alabama teams \u2013 and has served as a head coach in the Pac-12, SEC and NFL.\n\nCount Kiffin among the many people baffled at the lack of respect that No. 15 UCF has received in the polls in the wake the Knights\u2019 45-27 victory over Stanford on Saturday. The Knights eviscerated the Cardinal, leading 38-7 at halftime, forcing three-and-outs on the first three possessions and gaining 545 yards.\n\nThe victory improved UCF to 28-1 the past three seasons, as impressive of a run as any program in recent college football history. That included a blowout of Kiffin\u2019s Florida Atlantic team in Week 2.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nKiffin said he\u2019d rank the Knights somewhere between No. 5 and No. 10. He also said he\u2019d consider them a \u201cplayoff team\u201d if star quarterback McKenzie Milton was healthy. He couldn\u2019t understand why UCF has stagnated in the polls over the first month, as UCF is No. 15 in the Associated Press poll and No. 16 in the Coaches Poll.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a name game,\u201d Kiffin said of the rankings. \u201cPeople rank teams on the history of the program way too much instead of looking at the quality of the work.\u201d\n\nUCF\u2019s last regular season chance to prove themselves against a so-called power conference team comes this weekend at Pittsburgh. The Knights blasted Pitt, 45-14, last year and watched Pitt win the ACC Coastal division.\n\nWhile UCF could potentially face better teams this season \u2013 Temple, Cincinnati and perhaps Memphis in the AAC title game \u2013 this Pitt game looms large in a perception war that UCF is losing convincingly.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt just seems like this bias toward established brands has become more of a thing since we started this playoff,\u201d UCF athletic director Danny White said in a phone interview on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s great for the sport.\u201d\n\nUCF head coach Josh Heupel can't be happy with where the Knights are ranked right now. (USAT)\n\nWhite wouldn\u2019t take the leap to say that he\u2019s concerned the low poll placement would impact the College Football Playoff committee, which chooses the four-team field. But no one would argue that it\u2019s helping.\n\nKiffin\u2019s eye test began in pregame warmups, where he\u2019s long taken the time to study personnel.\n\n\u201cThey looked just like an ACC or SEC team,\u201d Kiffin told Yahoo Sports in a phone interview on Wednesday night. \u201cNot Alabama or Clemson, but one of the top teams in both of those conferences. They\u2019ve done an unbelievable job recruiting. They have skill. Normally in the Group of Five they have skill players but not the [size on] the lines, well UCF has long and good-looking linemen.\u201d\n\nKiffin\u2019s Owls also played Ohio State earlier this year, and he said that the talent level was \u201cclose,\u201d with Ohio State being \u201ca little bit bigger\u201d on the lines. \u201cI thought Ohio State was as good looking as you can look,\u201d Kiffin said.\n\nAs UCF marched to back-to-back undefeated regular seasons, they never had a chance to seriously enter the four-team College Football Playoff discussion. UCF peaked at No. 8 last year and No. 12 in 2017 in the CFP rankings. Where they start this season will be the focus of much debate, as they started at No. 18 in 2017 and No. 12 last year, basically positions where they had no realistic shot at making the playoff. (UCF beat Auburn in the Peach Bowl, 34-27, two years ago and lost to LSU, 40-32, last year without Milton, the dazzling quarterback who is still recovering from a horrific leg injury in November.)\n\nUCF hasn\u2019t lost a regular season football game since November of 2016, and the feeling among Kiffin and others is that this defensive unit is the best they\u2019ve had during the run. But a disconnect remains with the respect they\u2019ve been afforded.\n\nStanford coach David Shaw politely declined comment when Yahoo Sports reached out this week. It\u2019s hard to blame him, as few coaches relish dwelling on trips to the woodshed. He was direct after the game: \u201cThey are one of the best teams in America,\u201d he said.\n\nThe vexing question remains when they\u2019ll get treated like one. If UCF isn\u2019t in the top 10 when the initial College Football Playoff rankings are revealed, they\u2019ll have little chance to ascend to the top four. The fact that they\u2019re already behind in the polls to a one-loss team (Texas) and a few that have looked uninspired \u2013 Florida, Michigan, Notre Dame \u2013 seems silly based on both recent history and quantifiable performance. UCF has outscored their opponents 155-21 and ranks in the top 20 in scoring offense and defense.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s some people that think if you\u2019re not a blue-blood program, you can\u2019t play elite-level football,\u201d UCF coach Josh Heupel said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen I was a player and won a national championship [at Oklahoma], at that time if you were in middle America and Big 12 country, the thought and perception was you couldn\u2019t win a championship if you weren\u2019t from state of Florida.\u201d\n\nUCF's Dillon Gabriel attempts a pass during a game between Stanford Cardinal on Sept. 14. (Getty)\n\nThat obviously changed over time. But some things haven\u2019t changed. Former WAC commissioner Karl Benson recalled the struggles Boise State had in getting recognized as a contender in the Bowl Championship Series race. It took nearly a decade of dominance and two Fiesta Bowl wins for Boise to start appearing in the preseason top 10.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if UCF and the AAC can do more than they\u2019re already doing,\u201d Benson said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing and frustrating. I don\u2019t know if you ever overcome it.\u201d\n\nAAC commissioner Mike Aresco embraced positive comments by ESPN\u2019s Kirk Herbstreit this week the same way a democratic political candidate would an endorsement from The New York Times. Herbstreit criticized voters for not ranking UCF high enough and said they should be in the No. 9 to No. 10 range. Herbstreit admitted he\u2019d been a skeptic of UCF in past years, but was won over in part because of the body of work and the precocious performance by freshman quarterback Dillon Gabriel (22-for-30 and 4 TDs against Stanford).\n\nWhite appreciated the comments as well, as he\u2019s baffled by what voters are seeing.\n\n\u201cFor those that rank us in the bottom of the top 25, I don\u2019t think you can think that\u2019s factual,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be some other motivation. It\u2019s disappointing because it\u2019s disrespectful to our kids and what they\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d\n\nNearly 15 years ago, Urban Meyer was in a similar position to Heupel when he coached at Utah. The Utes went 12-0, blasted Pittsburgh in the Fiesta Bowl and Meyer recalled a season that necessitated perfection and \u201cstarted to weigh on us as a team.\u201d Meyer, now an analyst for Fox, added: \u201cYou ending up feeling like you can\u2019t just win, but you have to really win. I felt so much pressure.\u201d That included when to pull starters, as the optics of wins became important.\n\nFifteen years later, UCF is facing a similar expectation of perfection in order to bend a narrative. Kiffin can only chuckle at the predictability of it all.\n\n\u201cWhat more do you want them to do?\u201d he said. \u201cThese other big-name teams scrape by and are ranked ahead of them. These guys are blowing out everyone they play.\u201d\n\nWill another blowout win Saturday against Pittsburgh change anything? White and Heupel are just hoping for open minds.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The bias is real.
