It is Zuckerberg\u2019s first known visit to Capitol Hill since he testified before Congress in 2018.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-VA) told Yahoo Finance he organized a dinner meeting with several senators at Facebook\u2019s (FB) request.\n\n\u201cI think Zuckerberg wanted to hear the...state of our thinking and I've been quite harsh in some of my criticism of Facebook and I've got a series of bills, bi-partisan, that I think would put some rules of the road in place,\u201d Warner said. \u201cBut I really wanted him to hear from my colleagues, many of them who had maybe not weighed in on these issues in a large way \u2014 how concerned they were as well.\u201d\n\nThe group included Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) who in a hearing just hours earlier, blasted antitrust officials for a lack of urgency to take on big tech companies.\n\n\n\nZuckerberg also met with Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, the CEO was met with Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) \u2014 who has called Facebook \u201ccreepy\u201d and a \u201cmonopoly\u201d \u2014 and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), chairman of the Senate\u2019s antitrust subcommittee.\n\nSelf-regulation isn\u2019t going to work\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance, Warner said the senators at the dinner meeting covered a wide range of topics with Zuckerberg \u2014 including data privacy, transparency, election security and Libra.\n\nWarner said Zuckerberg realizes self-regulation isn\u2019t going to work.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re ready to move forward. I want to see, as well, that same cooperation level from Google and Twitter,\u201d said Warner. \u201cThe longer we wait to act at the federal level \u2014 all they're doing is raising the floor. Because as other countries and other states move forward, then when the federal government moves...the old ceiling will become a floor and they may end up with an even greater regime.\u201d\n\nWarner has introduced several bipartisan bills to put rules of the road in place for tech companies, but so far Congress has not acted on any significant legislation to regulate big tech. He urged Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take up his bills.\n\n\u201cGive us a chance to debate these on the floor. I think they'll get 70 votes, If I'm wrong, so be it,\u201d said Warner.\n\nThe senator said lawmakers need to move past broad conversations about big tech and start drafting specific proposals they can pass.\n\n\u201cThe hard work of saying, \u2018okay, let's go through a piece of legislation\u2019 and see where we agree and see where we disagree,\u201d said Warner.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies for a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing regarding the company's use and protection of user data on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 11, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis More\n\nAs we get better, the Russians get better\n\nWarner is the top Democratic senator on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nHe blames reluctance from the Trump administration, at least in part, for Congress\u2019s inaction on tech legislation.\n\nWarner told Yahoo Finance the White House has criticized big tech, but still \u201chates to get into anything \u2014 for example, around election security that involves these platforms \u2014 because the president acts like that somehow undermines the credibility of this election. I\u2019m not here to re-litigate 2016.\u201d\n\nWarner said Facebook and other big social media companies have gotten better preventing bad actors from trying to interfere in elections. Smaller platforms, he says, still have work to do.\n\n\u201cAs we get better, the Russians and others get better,\u201d said Warner.\n\nThe senator warned protecting the 2020 election will require continual work against deepfake technology that\u2019s growing more and more sophisticated.\n\n\u201cThat's going to take a much greater level of technology scrutiny. We're going to need our law enforcement and Intel community to have the tools they need, and that's going to have to be done collaboratively,\u201d said Warner.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg got \u201can earful\u201d from a group of U.S. senators at a restaurant in the nation\u2019s capital Wednesday evening.", "authors": ["Jessica Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wiFSNJt4pyfpAbI96JuPIg--~B/aD0zMjU1O3c9NDg0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/1fee9380-91e8-11e9-adcd-8b5e2d8885a2", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
