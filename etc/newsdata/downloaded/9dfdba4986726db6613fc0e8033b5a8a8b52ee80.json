This is obviously especially frustrating to paying households on these lines and we have extended our apologies to them and have explained the situation. When necessary, the municipality appoints contractors to remove illegal connections and power is restored once all lines have been inspected and confirmed clear of any illegal connections.\"\n\nA report has been submitted to the Department of Labour and police have opened an inquest docket.\n\nThree other electrocutions have taken place in the area over the past year, with two other children being electrocuted due to illegal connections.\n\nGerber has appealed to all communities to refrain from making illegal connections.\n\n\"We recognise that people want electricity, but there are good reasons why procedures of supply must be followed. Stealing electricity is very dangerous for everyone - not just for the ones making connections, but for every person and animal within the illegal connection zone. Children are especially vulnerable as they are curious and likely to explore and dig out electricity lines or try to open up rigged boxes and interesting-looking wires.\"", "description": "A child has been electrocuted by an illegal connection in Dube Village, Thembalethu, according to a statement by the George Municipality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7815/f9f0e36d1d0f4586bbedb535a6129918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
