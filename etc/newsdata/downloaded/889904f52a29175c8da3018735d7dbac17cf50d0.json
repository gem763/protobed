I think we need to move forward with determination.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

They have been regulated in the withdrawal agreement, they have been covered \u2013 but they still remain. Whether we\u2019re talking about the peace in Ireland, citizens\u2019 rights, budgetary issues, they would all need to be settled.\u201d\n\nThe EU has asked the UK to present proposals to replace the Irish backstop, which Mr Johnson says he wants to scrap. But with a 30-day deadline that Mr Johnson set for himself in Berlin almost exhausted, the UK has yet to present anything concrete in writing.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I called on the PM to come forward with operational proposals in writing for practical steps which would allow us to achieve those objectives.\u201d\n\nAlthough it has not presented full proposals, the UK has come forward with one idea: a theoretical veto for Northern Ireland on any backstop replacement. This plan was however dismissed by Guy Verhofstadt on Wednesday as \u201da permanent instrument for blackmailing\u201d the EU during negotiations.\n\nMr Verhofstadt, the parliament\u2019s Brexit chief, took the opportunity to round on the decision by the UK government to suspend parliament, telling MEPs: \u201cJean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk can do a lot of things but at least they cannot close the doors of our [parliament].\n\n\u201cIf the eurosceptics want to make their ridiculous comparison again to the Soviet Union from now on they can point the finger to Westminster instead of to Strasbourg or Brussels.\u201d\n\nHe also warned that the UK would not be allowed to become \u201ca Singapore in the North Sea\u201d after it left, adding \u201cthat will not happen\u201d. He also voiced concerns about the EU settlement scheme set up by the UK\u2019s Home Office, telling MEPs: \u201cWhat we don\u2019t need a bureaucratic application as now \u2013 what we need is the automatic application of all our EU citizens.\u201d\n\nMEPs in the European Parliament are later expected to approve a resolution that says they support an extension of Article 50 to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Independent understands that there was controversy on the parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group over whether the resolution should include \u201cpreventing a no-deal\u201d as one of the possible justifications for an Article 50 extension. Some MEPs on the group \u2013 thought to be close to Emmanuel Macron \u2013 attempted to have the justification removed, leaving only a general election and second referendum as reasons for a further delay.\n\nThe attempt failed \u2013 meaning the parliament supports an extension in virtually all circumstances to stop the UK crashing out. While the parliament\u2019s position on an extension is purely symbolic \u2013 because the question of one is down to EU leaders on the Council \u2013 the episode highlights the existence of divisions on the EU side over the question of further delays.", "description": "The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator has told Boris Johnson to stop \u201cpretending\u201d he is negotiating a Brexit deal, amid concerns that the prime minister is not\u00a0trying to reach an agreement.
