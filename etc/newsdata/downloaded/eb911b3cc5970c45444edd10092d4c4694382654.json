They\u2019d enlisted BAFTA-winning screenwriter Peter Straughan, who spent more than a year winnowing the sprawling 771-page novel down to manageable movie length. They\u2019d hired director John Crowley, whose previous literary adaptation Brooklyn landed three Oscar nominations including Best Picture earlier that year, and who continued to toil over the script with Straughan for six more months. Accompanied by Crowley, the producers marched onto the Warner Bros. Burbank lot to lay out a mood board for top studio executives, explaining what The Goldfinch was going to look and feel like onscreen, who they wanted to cast, and, perhaps most importantly, how much it all was going to cost. At which point the project came close to falling apart.\n\nA Dickensian coming-of-age story, Tartt\u2019s novel is filled with big swings at enormous themes \u2014 parental loss, unrequited love, addiction, redemption, tragedy\u2019s power to shape lives, the immortality of artwork. The story spans two decades but coalesces around the unlikely trajectory of a literal goldfinch \u2014 at least, an exquisite 13-by-9-inch painting of one by the 17th-century Dutch artist Carel Fabritius \u2014 which disappears from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the aftermath of a terrorist bombing that kills the mother of a young patron. That character, Theo Decker, is subsequently uprooted from his citified Manhattan existence to the wilds of suburban Las Vegas (where he befriends a druggy, precocious, similarly motherless Ukrainian teenager named Boris). When calamity strikes again, Theo returns to the Big Apple where he becomes a wunderkind of antiques restoration (and later, art forgery). In the book\u2019s final act, Theo is transplanted once more, this time to Amsterdam where he gets roped into a veritable gangster drama.\n\nInterpreting all that trans- and intercontinental action, with an ensemble cast and prestige production design, was never going to be done on a shoestring budget. But in an era when serious, adult-skewing dramas are edging closer to extinction every year (by dint of their dwindling commerciality), Warner Bros. studio bosses felt the money Jacobson and Simpson needed to accomplish their adaptation was too much. \u201cThe executives wanted to make it there. Question was, how do you offset the costs?\u201d Simpson recalls. \u201cUsually you go to one tax-credit city and shoot everything there. But this book is set in Amsterdam, New York, and Las Vegas. It was a real quandary \u2026 There came a point where it was like, \u2018What is it going to cost? How do we justify those numbers internally?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe fact that a two and a half hour big-screen version of Tartt\u2019s book \u2014 starring Ansel Elgort and Nicole Kidman \u2014 exists at all speaks to a groundbreaking partnership between Warner Bros., which will theatrically distribute the film worldwide, and Amazon Studios, which nabbed streaming video-on-demand rights in exchange for footing a substantial chunk of the movie\u2019s budget. What can\u2019t be overstated is that at a time of dwindling theatrical attendance, major movie studios and streaming giants don\u2019t generally see eye to eye, and never co-finance films together. But this deal has the potential to change the calculus of how such serious dramas get made in modern Hollywood. \u201cThis could be a game-changer for our business model,\u201d several people close to the production quoted Toby Emmerich, chairman of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, as having said. (Studio spokespeople at Warner Bros. and Amazon Studios declined to make any of their executives available to speak to Vulture for this article.)\n\nTo this day, Jacobson, the former president of Disney\u2019s Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group turned independent producer, still marvels at Warners\u2019 and Amazon\u2019s agreement to effectively share custody of The Goldfinch \u2014 under ordinary circumstances, the drama\u2019s SVOD rights would have gone to the studio\u2019s corporate sibling HBO. \u201cEvery studio has a certain way all of their movies work in terms of output to streaming or the post-theatrical market,\u201d she says. \u201cSo to break with that history took a lot of desire and willingness on the part of Warners, up and down the corporate ladder.\u201d\n\nOakes Fegley (young Theo) and Finn Wolfhard (young Boris) in The Goldfinch. Photo: Macall Polay/Warner Bros.\n\nThe origin of this deal can be traced back to early 2013, before The Goldfinch had even been published, when Tartt\u2019s veteran book-to-movie agent Ron Bernstein sent the manuscript to Jacobson and Simpson (partners in the production company Color Force). It was a natural fit: The production company had enjoyed a run of success with previous literary adaptations like the Hunger Games franchise. The executives had a reputation for maintaining writers\u2019 authorial vision in transposing their books to the screen, as they would do with 2018\u2019s Crazy Rich Asians.\n\nThe producers loved the book and became \u201cattached\u201d to shop its rights and develop the book into a movie or miniseries in May of 2013. But they held off on approaching major studios, networks, and streaming services for financing until the book finally hit shelves in September. They knew persuading studio development executives to read some random 800-page book would be an uphill battle. \u201cWe made a plan to wait and let the book explode \u2014 which we felt sure it would do,\u201d Simpson says.\n\nSure enough, The Goldfinch exploded, spending more than a year on the New York Times best-seller list and selling millions of copies around the world. In 2014, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and Hollywood came calling. In addition to Warner Bros. \u2014 which tried and failed for almost a decade to mount an adaptation of Tartt\u2019s 1992 debut novel, The Secret History \u2014 three other studios took a run at buying The Goldfinch rights. According to people briefed on the matter, Tartt blanched at the idea of turning the book into a miniseries on a streaming service (back in 2013, the only antecedent would have been Netflix\u2019s House of Cards) and Warners emerged victorious, with Brett Ratner boarding the project as an executive producer by way of a slate financing deal his RatPac Entertainment banner had struck with the studio. (Through a Warner Bros. representative, the reclusive Tartt declined to comment for this article.)\n\nWe made a plan to wait and let the book explode \u2014 which we felt sure it would do.\n\nIn November 2014, Color Force brought on British playwright-author Straughan, who earned a 2012 Oscar nomination for adapting John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for the screen. He felt that The Goldfinch\u2019s chronological odyssey could never boil down to a two-hour movie, so he decided upon the movie\u2019s most radical departure from its source material: The film begins with adult Theo in Amsterdam in the present day, then flashes back in time to 13-year-old Theo, and later leaps forward to the dubious dealings of pre-Amsterdam Theo. Roughly half the film showcases actor Oakes Fegley as the junior version of the character, with Elgort playing the man he develops into. \u201cMoving back and forth and focusing in on just two time periods of the story meant that we would be casting two actors rather than three or maybe four,\u201d says Irish-born Crowley, who joined The Goldfinch in 2016, the year Straughan\u2019s first draft had been delivered. \u201cThat made it not just practically possible but cinematically possible. It allowed us to visually tell a story in which the past is constantly sitting on the present\u2019s shoulders.\u201d\n\nEven without a green light from the studio, Color Force continued assembling its creative quorum, which included Oscar-winning cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer K.K. Barrett (who frequently works with filmmakers Spike Jonze and Sofia Coppola). At the 2016 meeting with Warners executives, Crowley produced an A4 book featuring a dozen or so images pulled from the internet, explaining the \u201cfeeling\u201d of each section of the movie as well as its color palette and \u201cwhat kind of cinematic language it could translate into,\u201d the director remembers. That\u2019s when budget negotiations between the studio and the producer broke down. \u201cThis is the big moment where you go in and say, \u2018Here\u2019s the movie and here\u2019s the ask,\u2019\u201d says Jacobson, who with Simpson offered to reduce their producers\u2019 fees as a show of good faith. \u201cYou hope that it\u2019s a week or two and then you\u2019re off to the races. But that was not to be.\u201d\n\nAnsel Elgort and Jeffrey Wright in The Goldfinch.

This rather straightforward proposition, however, violated typical protocol. Under the prevailing business model (which has been in place since the dawn of pay TV) studios make movies, show them in theaters, and accept a licensing fee from cable channels and streaming services to make that content available on their platforms after the movies have receded from the multiplex. Disney licenses its films to Netflix; at Lionsgate, the go-to is Epix. For Warner Bros., operating under the corporate umbrella of Time Warner at that time, the feeder platform for its post-theater movies was HBO.\n\nAmazon Studios, for its part, has an original film division that has produced and distributed such titles as Manchester by the Sea, The Big Sick, and You Were Never Really Here. Like Netflix, it licenses films from other studios, and those fees represent the majority of Amazon\u2019s expenditures on content. The proposed Warners deal would not fit into either category.\n\nThe Color Force producers initially explored bailing on Warner Bros. altogether and setting up The Goldfinch exclusively with Amazon, but a co-finance deal began to seem sweeter \u2014 and more possible. Aloni remained instrumental in the deal-making process. Over the course of nearly a year of shuttle diplomacy, top executives at both companies met repeatedly to hash out an agreement. Among them: Jason Ropell, Amazon\u2019s vice-president and worldwide head of motion pictures, and Ted Hope, its head of motion-picture production. At Warner Bros., production president Courtenay Valenti, president of worldwide business affairs Steve Spira, and chairman Toby Emmerich were among the executives representing studio interests. (Like Emmerich, neither Valenti or Spira were made available for comment.)\n\nYou can debate the purpose of art endlessly. But I think we can agree that art is there to be seen.\n\n\u201cWe had a long history with Ted Hope but a lot of new ideas had to be explored in order to make the partnership work, given that there was no precedent for it,\u201d Jacobson says. Adds Simpson: \u201cAmazon made sense because obviously, this book had been featured on their platform. It makes sense to have a synergistic partnership where they had direct access to fans of the book through their site.\u201d\n\nThe negotiations reached the top of the corporate totem pole in both companies with Ropell traveling to Seattle to the tech giant\u2019s corporate mothership to plead the case for partnership to Amazon\u2019s top brass. Warner Bros. then\u2013chief executive Kevin Tsujihara huddled with Time Warner\u2019s then-CEO Jeff Bewkes \u2014 who had top-down oversight on both Warner Bros. and HBO \u2014 in order to enact the deal. In the end, Amazon agreed to shoulder more than 30 percent of The Goldfinch\u2019s reported $40 million budget in addition to paying a licensing fee for the pay TV rights, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who declined to be identified.\n\nThe upsides for both companies were obvious: Warners could suddenly afford to be in the prestige drama business in a moment when studio slates are increasingly dominated by reboots, sequels, and spinoffs; and if The Goldfinch succeeded at the box office, Amazon\u2019s equity stake would pay for its streaming licensing fee.\n\n\u201cThis is a great model for us,\u201d Emmerich reportedly said at the time. \u201cIt creates a model that potentially allows Warner Bros. to make dramas or urban-skewing or domestic-skewing films for a higher budget through a partnership with Amazon.\u201d\n\nNicole Kidman in The Goldfinch. Photo: Roadshow Films\n\nThroughout the deal-making, Crowley and Straughan continued hammering away at the script. \u201cWe kept focusing on, \u2018What could feel like Masterpiece Theatre?\u2019 and dissolve them away and, \u2018What could feel like a more lucid version?\u2019\u201d Crowley says. Kidman\u2019s character (Mrs. Barbour, who takes in an orphaned Theo) was beefed up in the page-to-screen translation. \u201cShe is a key character opposite both versions of Theo and in a lot of ways expresses something very difficult to express in film which is him missing his mother,\u201d the director explains.\n\nBut real-life dramas surrounding the production weren\u2019t over yet. In November 2017, six women came forward to accuse Goldfinch executive producer Brett Ratner of sexual harassment and misconduct. \u201cWhen all of the news broke, we had to call Warners and say, like, \u2018This just can\u2019t be,\u2019\u201d Jacobson recalls. \u201cWe would often look at our department heads and ask ourselves, \u2018Are we doing everything we can to be inclusive as a team and in major roles of responsibility?\u2019 So in terms of representation and visibility behind and in front of the camera, no. There was not going to be any kind of gentle way to proceed other than not at all. And Warners was very responsive and right away the change was made and RatPac became unattached.\u201d\n\nCameras finally began to roll in January 2018 in New York City, with later shoots taking place in Amsterdam and Albuquerque, New Mexico (which stands in for the desolate suburbs outside of Las Vegas described in the book); principal photography wrapped that May. Fast-forward to this month, when the film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to mixed reviews. Variety called The Goldfinch a \u201cskittery cinematic transcription\u201d of Tartt\u2019s novel, while IGN opined, \u201cJohn Crowley and Peter Straughan have largely succeeded in doing justice to this lovely tome.\u201d\n\nIt was maybe a very brave mistake to try to make a movie out of a novel like #TheGoldfinch but not an uninteresting one, I sort of fell for it anyway #TIFF2019 \u2014 Leah Greenblatt (@Leahbats) September 9, 2019\n\nAs The Goldfinch enters the prestige-movie scrum in the opening days of awards season, its hybrid-financing pedigree presents certain questions for a Hollywood rapidly becoming populated by new streaming services (including Warner Bros.\u2019 impending corporate stepsister HBO Max \u2014 which ultimately means no more team-ups between the studio and Amazon). Have we entered a new era of cooperation between streaming giants and once-circumspect studios? Can any industry observers reasonably expect other studios \u2014 Sony, Lionsgate, Focus, Paramount \u2014 to enter into similar deals in the near future?\n\nWhen asked what ideas he hopes audiences will take away from his film, Crowley waxes philosophical about the Dutch masterpiece whose theft powers the plot. But his remarks serve as a handy metaphor for the making of The Goldfinch. \u201cThe idea for me is that something as beautiful as The Goldfinch was created to live in light, and that the greatest sin is that it\u2019s hidden from view,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can debate the purpose of art endlessly. But I think we can agree that art is there to be seen, read, experienced. There\u2019s actually a big idea about culture \u2014 or maybe civilization \u2014 passing something on that lurks within.\u201d", "description": "How the Groundbreaking Partnership Behind The Goldfinch Could Alter Hollywood.
