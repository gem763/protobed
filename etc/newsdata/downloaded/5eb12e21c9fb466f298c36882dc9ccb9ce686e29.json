But he added that pilots \"should not be expected to take a significant and ever-expanding financial loss as a result of Boeing's negligence.\"\n\nSWAPA estimated that the 737 MAX grounding had wiped out more than 30,000 scheduled Southwest flights, reducing the airline's passenger service by 8 percent by the end of 2019.\n\nSouthwest is scheduling flights without the MAX until at least early January, pending regulatory approval for commercial flight.\n\nPilots at American Airlines Group, which so far has cancelled MAX flights through early December, have also demanded compensation for lost pay related to the 737 MAX grounding, but have not filed a lawsuit.\n\nSWAPA, which represents approximately 10,000 Southwest pilots, said it filed the lawsuit in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas.\n\nLast month, Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly promised the airline would share any reimbursement from Boeing over the MAX grounding with its employees.", "description": "Pilots say Boeing had promised them the latest 737s were similar to previous models before crashes grounded planes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/12d830640cd048db8058532274a433e6_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
