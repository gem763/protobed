The party has asked the Supreme Court to approve recounts in six electoral districts.\n\nThe loss of the Senate majority coupled with a smaller than hoped for majority in the lower house came as a blow to PiS, which had hoped for a stronger mandate to continue its overhauls of the justice system, media and cultural institutions.\n\nOpposition parties hold 48 of 100 seats in the upper house, but wield a majority thanks to three independent senators who are broadly supportive.\n\nPolish media have reported that PiS, which also holds 48 upper house seats, has made overtures to opposition senators in an attempt to establish a working majority.\n\nOpposition parties, who united in a joint list for the Senate race, said they would ask for recounts in three districts.\n\n\"Our protests would take place regardless of whether or not PiS submitted theirs. We have real grounds for our protests,\" Marek Borowski, a senator from Civic Coalition, the largest opposition grouping, told reporters.\n\nOpposition protests centred around the allegedly mistaken use or confusing positioning of logos on ballot papers, as well as that PiS did not announce early enough its replacement for a candidate who had died.\n\nIn a separate press conference Civic Coalition leader Grzegorz Schetyna questioned the government's motives for demanding the recounts.\n\n\"Filing protests, if there is reason to do so, is always justified. If the reason is just losing the election and not accepting the result, such things are fundamentally politically unjust,\" Schetyna said.\n\nSchetyna added he had received a promise that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) would monitor any recount.\n\nThe Supreme Court has up to 90 days to rule on the validity of elections.\n\n\"We have nothing to hide, if somebody wants international checks we have nothing against that,\" PiS deputy spokesman Radoslaw Fogiel was quoted saying by state-run news agency PAP.
