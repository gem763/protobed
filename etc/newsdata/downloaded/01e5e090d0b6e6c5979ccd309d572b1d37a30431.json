Public accounting firms argued that it would likely increase individual partners\u2019 legal exposure and audit costs without improving the quality of an audit.\n\nThe rule doesn\u2019t appear to have had the effect the PCAOB sought, according to the study, to be published by the American Accounting Association in the September/October issue of the association\u2019s peer-reviewed academic journal, the Accounting Review.\n\nWhile researchers did observe an increase in audit quality, they were able to determine that the rule had little to do with the improvement, according to the study, which was conducted by accounting professors at the University of Tennessee, the University of Kansas, Virginia Tech and James Madison University. Researchers also found that the rule hasn\u2019t led to an apparent increase in audit costs.\n\nThe study, which examined at least 1,000 companies, used multiple control groups of publicly traded audit clients to determine whether to attribute the rise in audit quality to the rule itself. One of the groups consisted of companies that had already disclosed an audit partner\u2019s name at annual shareholders\u2019 meetings and on company websites before the rule went into effect, the study said.\n\nTo measure audit quality, the researchers used proxies such as F-scores, or measures of companies\u2019 tendencies to misstate earnings, and mistaken assessments of firms\u2019 internal controls over financial reporting, the study said.\n\nThe researchers were unable to pinpoint why audit quality increased, but they speculated that the impact of the PCAOB\u2019s oversight efforts and firms\u2019 technological advances played a role.\n\nThe study noted the findings are preliminary and that further research on the rule\u2019s long-term effects is necessary.\n\n\u201cThe more years of this rule that researchers can study, the more informational value and historical trends in performance will be provided,\u201d said Sarah Stein, an assistant accounting professor at Virginia Tech and one of the study\u2019s authors.\n\nA representative for the PCAOB declined to comment.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "A rule requiring public companies to identify an individual audit partner in financial reporting has had little impact on audit quality, new research suggests.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108421/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
