Beginning November, the interest rate on savings deposits of up to Rs 1 lakh will be 3.25% as compared to the current rate of 3.5%. Saving deposits above Rs 1 lakh are linked to the repo rate and currently fetch a return of 3%.\n\nTo put the new interest rate in perspective, it makes sense to look at Reserve Bank of India\u2019s projection for retail inflation. In the second half of 2019-20, retail inflation is forecast to range from 3.5% to 3.7%.\n\nThis means that the savings interest rate fetches a negative return when adjusted for inflation.\n\nIf the trend setting SBI can reduce savings rates, can other banks be far behind?\n\nIf the recent history of savings deposit interest rates is taken into account, generally only a couple of banks are outliers. They are willing to offer slightly higher rates. Most banks offer the same rate.\n\nIf this pattern holds, the Indian retail saving deposit account holder is going to lose out in inflation adjusted terms.\n\nKeep in mind that lending rates are not really market determined. RBI has mandated an external benchmark for pricing loans, something which came after strong advocacy on the part of experts. Many experts also complained frequently in the last few years about the real rate of interest for borrowers.\n\nThe same experts don\u2019t seem too bothered by the real rate of interest for deposit holders. It is reasonable to assume that if deposit holders are subject to negative returns for an extended period, there will be consequences for the financial system.\n\nStrangely, that doesn\u2019t seem to bother many experts.\n\nDeposit holders in India are pretty much on their own even if the total savings deposits at the end of 2018-19 represented as much as 21% of the size of nominal gross deposit product.\n\nThe experience of the deposit holders of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank should teach retail savers that accomplished practitioners of patriot games will never exert themselves to help them. Their efforts are reserved for some borrowers.\n\nThe Indian retail saver is taken for granted. And why not? What can they do and where can they go?", "description": "State Bank of India, India\u2019s largest bank by balance sheet size, recently lowered interest rates of savings deposits.
