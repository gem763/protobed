Lorenzo gives his locks for the weekend. USA TODAY\n\nNobody would dispute that little went right for Pittsburgh Steelers kicker Chris Boswell throughout the 2018 season.\n\nHe set career lows in field-goal-conversion rate and extra-point-conversion rate, drawing the ire of the fan base and \u2013 according to guard Ramon Foster \u2013 even received death threats over his poor performance.\n\n\u201cThe death threats that guy received, the \u2018you suck\u2019, the \u2018they should cut you, we hate you,\u2019 you ignore it but you still hear remnants of it,\u201d Foster told The Athletic. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go anywhere, you don\u2019t want to talk to anybody, you want to fix your problem.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Boswell converted 13 of 20 in field goal (65%) and also missed five extra points to go 43 of 48 (89.6 %).\n\nAccording to The Athletic, the Steelers brought in Shaun Suisham, who was the team's kicker from 2010-14, to consult with Boswell last season after he started to struggle. The team then asked to defer a $2 million roster bonus until the start of the 2019 regular season so that it could evaluate him throughout the offseason before making a final determination on his future with the team.\n\nThe Steelers even brought in other kickers to compete with Boswell before he won his job back for the 2019 campaign.\n\n\"I\u2019m happy for him because I know that getting the new contract, the pressure of it ate on him and it showed,\" Foster said. He was in a dark, dark spot last year.\"\n\nPittsburgh Steelers kicker Chris Boswell watches his field goal during the first half of an NFL football game against the San Francisco 49ers.

Boswell has been perfect, connecting on all 10 of his field goal tries and all nine extra point attempts.\n\n\u201cBos has his swag back,\u201d cornerback Joe Haden said. \u201cHe won a couple of games for me like that in my first season here. It was a down year last year but he\u2019s back to the normal Bos, walking around, swag-like and making kicks.\u201d\n\n100 WORST TEAMS OF ALL TIME: Could Dolphins, Redskins join most hopeless in history?\n\nWEEK 6 PICKS: Do Dolphins or Redskins break into win column?\n\nThe Steelers are 1-4, currently in third place in the AFC North, and two games back of the division-leading Ravens. If Pittsburgh, which went 9-6-1 last season and missed the postseason, in part because of Boswell's shaky performance, is to generate any kind of push for the playoffs, it will need Boswell to stay on top of his game.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s found a good spot to be in now,\u2019\u2019 Foster said. \u201cI think the competition in camp, the spring, the pushback of the signing bonus, just all of that helped him mature. They\u2019re very special, finicky guys and I say that in a respectful way. It\u2019s like the starting pitcher on game day. Nobody talks to him. That guy does nothing until he puts it on display for everybody.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a football player, and the mental part of this will wear you the hell out. The criticism \u2014 people say you ought to be able to take criticism, you\u2019re right but there\u2019s a very fine line on believing it and trust in yourself.\u201d", "description": "Pittsburgh Steelers kicker Chris Boswell received death threats from fans during a down 2018 season, teammate Ramon Foster said.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Reyes", "Published A.M.
