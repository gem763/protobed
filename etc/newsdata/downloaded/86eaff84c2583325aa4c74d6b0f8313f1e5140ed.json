Leonov also helped Stafford adopt two Russian boys.\n\nSoviet cosmonaut Tereshkova called Leonov a true friend.\n\n\"It's hard to come to terms with the fact that we have to say goodbye to you today,\" said the 82-year-old Tereshkova.\n\n'Irreplaceable loss'\n\nRussian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev called him a \"great patriot\", while Leonov's friend, Lieutenant General Yury Babansky, said his passing was \"an irreplaceable loss\".\n\n\"We said our goodbyes but we will remember as long as we live,\" he told AFP.\n\nMany ordinary Russians also came to pay their respects including students who skipped classes to attend the funeral.\n\n\"This is a loss for the entire Soviet people and the whole of mankind,\" Boris Yesin, who worked with Leonov at the Baikonur launch site in Kazakhstan, told AFP.\n\n\"Working with him was hard but interesting.\"\n\nOn March 18, 1965, at the age of 30, Leonov made history when he left a spacecraft during the Voskhod 2 mission for a spacewalk that lasted 12 minutes and nine seconds.\n\nThat spacewalk nearly killed him as his spacesuit became inflated due to the lack of atmospheric pressure. He had to bleed off some of the oxygen in his suit, risking oxygen starvation.\n\nHis return to Earth also nearly ended in tragedy when Leonov and pilot Pavel Belyayev were forced to crash-land deep in the Russian woods.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who was on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi, last week sent his condolences to Leonov's widow and his daughter, calling him a \"true trailblazer\" and a \"heroic person\".\n\nLeonov became a legend at home and his feats were immortalised in cinema and literature. He was a friend of Yuri Gagarin, who became the first man in space in 1961 and trained with him.", "description": "Hundreds of people including Russian and US astronauts and top officials bid farewell to Alexei Leonov, a legendary Soviet cosmonaut who was the first man to perform a spacewalk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9475/2fbd71a3cc9c4650be47851138784306.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
