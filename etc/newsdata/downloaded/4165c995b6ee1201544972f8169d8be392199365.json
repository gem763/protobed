Biden on Wednesday said he\u2019s feeling good about his fundraising, after he finished well back of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in terms of cash on hand at the close of last quarter.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Ohio, Mr. Biden said his campaign got started later than others.\n\n\u201cNumber two, we did not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever [that] money was raised from, into a race,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s a dig at 2020 rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has transferred at least $10.4 million from her 2018 U.S. Senate account to her presidential campaign and has caught or passed Mr. Biden in many recent polls on the race.\n\n\u201cNumber three, we\u2019ve been in the process of having about a third of the time that many people have had, and we\u2019re doing fine,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cOur fundraising is building. We\u2019ve raised a lot of money online, and we\u2019ve raised money offline as well \u2026 so we feel confident we\u2019re going to be ready.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont ended the quarter with the most cash on hand of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, with close to $34 million in the bank.\n\nMs. Warren was next at $25.7 million, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, at $23.3 million, Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California at $10.5 million, and Mr. Biden at just shy of $9 million.\n\nDespite Mr. Biden\u2019s confidence, his comparatively low cash-on-hand total just months before the Iowa caucuses should be a warning sign for a candidate who had long been considered the front-runner for the nomination, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe numbers for the vice president are pretty anemic for one of the front-runners,\u201d said Democratic strategist Jim Manley. \u201cMoney is not going to be an issue for the Democrat who makes it to the general election, but as [the] campaign moves towards the early voting states, this is not a good sign.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden and Ms. Harris were also among the candidates who spent more than they took in last quarter.\n\nThe former vice president\u2019s numbers are indicative of a \u201chead for the doors\u201d moment materializing in his campaign, said Neil Sroka, a spokesman for the liberal group Democracy for America.\n\n\u201cOr at least, the smart money would be heading toward the doors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is remarkable that the current mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has nearly triple the amount of money on hand that the former vice president of the United States has.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
