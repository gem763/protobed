I like it,\u201d says Mahbubul Bashar, in his 50s, whose smile reflected his joy at his new look.\n\nAbul Mia, a 60-year-old porter at a local vegetable market, agrees that the vibrant colouring can be transformative.\n\n\u201cI love it. My family says I look a lot younger and handsome,\u201d he adds.\n\nWhile henna has been used widely in the country for decades, it has reached new heights of popularity. It is now virtually impossible to walk down a street in a Bangladesh city without seeing a coloured beard.\n\nOrange hair \u2014 whether it\u2019s beards, moustaches or on heads \u2014 is everywhere, thanks to the popularity of the coloured dye produced by the flowering henna plant.\n\n\u201cPutting henna on has become a fashion choice in recent years for elder men,\u201d confirms Didarul Dipu, head fashion journalist at Canvas magazine.\n\n\u201cThe powder is easily found in neighbourhood stores and easy to put on,\u201d he adds.\n\nBut the quest for youth is not the only reason why more and more Dhaka barbers are adding beard and hair colouring to their services.\n\nTop imams also increasingly use henna powder colour in what experts say is a move to prove their Muslim credentials as some religious texts say the prophet Mohammed dyed his hair.\n\nIn Bangladesh most of the population of 168 million is Muslim.\n\n\u201cI heard from clerics that the prophet Mohammed used henna on his beard. I am just following,\u201d says Dhaka resident Abu Taher.\n\n\u2013 Beard fervour \u2013\n\nHenna has long been a tradition at South Asian weddings. Brides and grooms use henna paste to trace intricate patterns on their hands for wedding parties.\n\nIt has also long been used in Muslim communities in Asia and the Middle East for beards.\n\nPreviously, aficionados created the dye by crushing henna leaves to form a paste. It was messy and time-consuming but modern henna powder is far more user-friendly.\n\nTaher, who goes by one name, believes the dye has given his beard added vigour.\n\n\u201cLook at this growth. Isn\u2019t it strong?\u201d he exclaims pointing to his chin.\n\n\u201cThe powder turns the grey hair red but does not change the remaining black hair,\u201d he explains.\n\nSome believe henna powder has health benefits and, as it is natural rather than created using man-made chemicals like some dyes, does not cause any medical issues.\n\nThe new trend has also boosted barbers\u2019 fortunes \u2014 more men feel compelled to dye their hair and to do it more often at the salons.\n\n\u201cIn the past we hardly would get any customers for this,\u201d recalls Shuvo Das, who works at the Mahin Hairdressers in Dhaka\u2019s Shaheenbagh neighbourhood.\n\n\u201cBut now there are clients who come every week to get their beard dyed,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt takes about 40 minutes to make the beard reddish and shiny. It is also cheap. A pack cost only 15 taka (four US cents),\u201d Das explains as he massages the dye mixture \u2014 imported from India \u2014 into a customer\u2019s beard.\n\nAccording to Dhaka University sociology professor Monirul Islam Khan, the growing number of henna beards \u201cis a sign of increasing Muslim fervour in Bangladeshi society.\u201d\n\nBut, he adds, even those who are not strict followers do it.\n\nHe explains: \u201cThey want to look younger. Even the women are getting fond of it as it makes their hair glitter.\u201d", "description": "Dhaka (AFP) \u2013 From shades of startling red to hues of vivid tangerine, brightly coloured beards have become a fashion statement on the streets of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/cda55b_facial-hair-sunset-tones-is-now-go-older-men-wanting-off-years-in-bangladesh-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
