(Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times)\n\nIn an April 2017 interview with The Associated Press, President Donald Trump suddenly began talking about the hack of the Democratic National Committee a year earlier, complaining that the FBI had not physically examined the compromised server.\n\n\u201cThey brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike?\u201d the surprised reporter asked, referring to the California cybersecurity company that investigated how Russian government hackers had stolen and leaked Democratic emails, disrupting Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I heard,\u201d Trump resumed. \u201cI heard it\u2019s owned by a very rich Ukrainian; that\u2019s what I heard.\u201d\n\nMore than two years later, Trump was still holding on to this false conspiracy theory. In his July call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine, he summed it up in a sort of shorthand \u2014 at least according to the White House memorandum, labeled \u201cnot a verbatim transcript.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people \u2026,\u201d the president said. It is unclear whether the ellipses indicate that words were omitted or that Trump\u2019s voice was trailing off.\n\nThen he added one novel detail: \u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nNow, Trump\u2019s call for Ukraine to look into his CrowdStrike story forms the background to the House impeachment inquiry, which is focused on the second request he made: that Zelenskiy investigate Trump\u2019s possible 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump has placed a concoction of disprovable claims, of the kind usually found on the fringes of the web, squarely in the middle of American politics and diplomacy.\n\nThe tale of the supposedly hidden server may have appealed to Trump because it undercut a well-established fact that he has resented and resisted for three years: The Russian government interfered in the 2016 election to help him win, an effort thoroughly documented by American intelligence agencies and amply supported by public evidence.\n\nBy contrast, there is no evidence to support the president\u2019s vague suggestion that Ukraine, not Russia, might be responsible for the hacking, or that CrowdStrike somehow connived in it. But his alternate history has provided a psychological shield for the president against facts that he believes tarnish his electoral victory.\n\nTrump has long called for better relations with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and brushed aside complaints about its conduct. So there is a certain symmetry to his suggestion that Ukraine, Russia\u2019s opponent and the victim of its territorial grab, may somehow have framed Russia for the 2016 election activity.\n\n\u201cUkraine is the perfect scapegoat for him, because it\u2019s the enemy of Russia,\u201d said Nina Jankowicz, a fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington who regularly visits Ukraine and is writing a book called \u201cHow to Lose the Information War.\u201d\n\nShe noted that a number of Ukraine-linked stories, some of them distorted or exaggerated, have been pulled together by Trump\u2019s supporters into a single narrative.\n\nFor example, there is the idea, promoted by the president\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, that Ukraine\u2019s government actively sabotaged Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. A Ukrainian-American lawyer who consulted for the DNC looked into the finances of Paul Manafort and spoke with Ukrainian embassy officials. But there appears to have been no organized Ukrainian government effort to intervene \u2014 certainly nothing comparable to the activities of Russian intelligence agencies ordered by Putin.\n\nIt is true that a Ukrainian legislator helped publicize documents on Manafort\u2019s multimillion-dollar payments from a Ukrainian political party, leading to his resignation as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman. But the claim of Manafort\u2019s wrongdoing turned out to be justified. He is now serving seven and a half years in prison for financial fraud and other crimes.\n\nIn May, Trump recalled the American ambassador to Kyiv, Marie Yovanovitch, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2016, telling others she was scheming against his administration. She has denied it.\n\nAnd Trump has repeatedly charged that Biden, who handled Ukrainian affairs as vice president, tried to get a prosecutor fired for investigating a Ukrainian energy company that paid his son, Hunter, handsomely as a board member despite a lack of experience in Ukraine. In fact, multiple countries were pressing for the firing of the prosecutor, who they thought was turning a blind eye to corruption.", "description": "In an April 2017 interview with The Associated Press, President Donald Trump suddenly began talking about the hack of the Democratic National Committee a year earlier, complaining that the FBI had not physically examined the compromised server.\"They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based", "authors": ["Scott Shane"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TjBqLzwgymTogAaRkmRRow--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/11afcb35dd1099a6499d48cc7b771bb9", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
