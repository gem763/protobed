Becky Vanshur\n\nInsider recently observed scout snipers going through stalking training at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia.\n\nBefore the students entered the field, an instructor demonstrated proper technique.\n\nNot only was everyone unable to find the sniper with various optics at the observation post roughly 1,000 feet from his position, but a dozen Marines, a couple of Army Rangers, and I were unable to find him when he was less than 3 feet away.\n\nVisit Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nImagine an enemy you can\u2019t see, an invisible hunter as lethal as any of nature\u2019s fiercest predators. A concealed sniper is by far one of the deadliest forces on the battlefield.\n\nInsider visited Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia recently to observe US military snipers as they practiced hiding in plain sight. Before the training began, an instructor showed everyone how it\u2019s done.\n\ncaption Scout Sniper School instructor shows Marines and Army Rangers the tricks of the trade at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia. source Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\nA combat veteran who knows well the cost of a mistake, the instructor\u2019s execution was exceptional down to the last detail. A dozen Marines, a couple Army Rangers, and I failed to spot this man, even when he was only 3 feet away.\n\nThe Marine sniper moved undetected into position within about 300 meters of the observation post. Every observer, searching without success with high-powered optics, was in firing range.\n\ncaption Students searching for the sniper using various optics. source Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\nAt the observation post, troops used various monocular and binocular devices to scan the field in search of the sergeant, who had already painted his face and customized his ghillie suit with vegetation and was moving into firing position.\n\nNo one found him.\n\nA second instructor, who already knew where the Marine sniper was hiding, then walked into the field and announced over the radio that he was standing next to the concealed sniper, who could see us despite everyone at the observation post being unable to see him.\n\nThe unconcealed instructor then placed his hand on the sergeant\u2019s head. It didn\u2019t help. That\u2019s how good his cover was.\n\nAfter being told where he was, we went into the field to observe the sniper in his firing position.\n\ncaption Students head into the field to observe the sniper\u2019s firing position. source Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\nThis is where things got really interesting.\n\nAs we hiked into the field, everyone walked right past the sniper. He wasn\u2019t even 3 feet away, and we still missed him completely.\n\ncaption The sniper\u2019s firing position is hard to spot, even at close range. source Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\nThe above photo was taken right after everyone was told exactly where the sniper was. While he is somewhat visible from this angle, he was all but invisible when viewed from other positions.\n\nEveryone gathered around the sergeant to listen to him explain the tricks of the trade, lessons essential for not only making it through scout sniper stalking training but also surviving on the battlefield.\n\ncaption The sniper\u2019s position has been outlined in red. source Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\nSlowly emerging from his position, the instructor explained the need to use the terrain to your advantage, to find and build screens, to blend in with your environment, and to keep low and manage your movements.\n\nKeep low and use the terrain to your advantage.\n\ncaption Students listening to the sergeant explain his techniques. He still has his head down in this picture, making him almost invisible. source Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to use the terrain to my advantage,\u201d the instructor told his students. \u201cYou can see there is a hill back there, I don\u2019t want to go over the very top of the hill. I want to come around the side of the hill, follow the low dead space down, and then come up from behind into my position, always maintaining that low profile, low silhouette.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to stay as low as possible,\u201d he added, telling them to be aware of their movements in the field.\n\nFind and build screens that conceal your position.\n\ncaption Here the sniper has raised his head, making him easier to detect. source Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\n\u201cThe big thing you are looking for is trying to find some screens,\u201d the sergeant said, telling the trainees that would soon enter the field that they want at least two screens between them and a potential observer, such as tall grasses or other vegetation, that obscure the sniper from the watchful gaze of the enemy.\n\nGrassy areas can be easier to work in than some other environments, such as the desert, but these areas have their own challenges. For instance, muzzle blast will blow light vegetation outward, potentially giving away a sniper\u2019s position, if he is too close to his screen.\n\nA sniper may also need to build false screens to cover evidence of his presence, such as bent or broken grass. \u201cIt is really common, especially in grassy areas, to make false screens because of how easy it is to give away your position in grass,\u201d the instructor said, reminding students that shaking the grasses or moving abruptly could alert an enemy to their presence.\n\nThe sergeant admitted that his screens, while effective, weren\u2019t ideal, but he made up for that with his camouflage.\n\nBlend into your environment with camouflage.\n\ncaption As the sniper starts to stand up, his camouflage and concealment efforts, such as the mixing of vegetation into his ghillie suit, become visible. source Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\n\u201cYou and your gun need to look like everything around you,\u201d the instructor said, explaining that snipers want to blend into the negative space.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be the bush,\u201d he added. \u201cBe the space between the bushes.\u201d\n\nBefore the sergeant entered the field, he painted his face with browns on features that stick out and greens on flatter surfaces. In the field, he weaved grasses in natural patterns into his ghillie suit, and then, after he arrived at his firing position, he concealed his tripod and rifle in vegetation.\n\nAfter finishing the sergeant\u2019s short class, the students grabbed their gear and prepared to demonstrate what they learned.\n\ncaption Here is the sergeant standing to address his students before they prepare to enter the field. source Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\nSome excelled.
