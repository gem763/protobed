The Times writers (fully five on the byline: Peter Baker, Lara Jakes, Julian E. Barnes, Sharon LaFraniere, and Edward Wong) certainly don\u2019t decry the existence of this deep state, as so many conservatives and Trump supporters do. Nor do they refrain from the kinds of value-charged digs and asides against Trump that have illuminated the paper\u2019s consistent bias against the president from the beginning.\n\nBut they do portray the current impeachment drama as the likely denouement of a struggle between the outsider Trump and the insider administrative forces of government. In so doing, they implicitly give support to those who have argued that American foreign policy has become the almost exclusive domain of unelected bureaucrats impervious to the views of elected officials\u2014even presidents\u2014who may harbor outlooks different from their own.\n\nThis is a big deal because, even in today\u2019s highly charged political environment, with a sitting president under constant guerrilla attack, few have been willing to acknowledge any such deep state phenomenon. When in the spring of 2018, The National Interest asked 12 presumed experts\u2014historians, writers, former government officials, and think tank mavens\u2014to weigh in on whether there was in fact such a thing as a deep state, eight said no, two waffled with a \u201csort of\u201d response, and only two said yes. Former Colorado senator Gary Hart made fun of the whole concept, warning of \u201csly devils meeting in the furnace room after hours, passing out assignments for subverting the current administration.\u201d\n\nBut now the Times\u2019 Baker et al weigh in with an analysis saying that, yes, Trump has been battling something that some see as a deep state, and the deep state is winning. The headline: \u201cTrump\u2019s War on the \u2018Deep State\u2019 Turns Against Him.\u201d There\u2019s an explanatory subhed that reads: \u201cThe impeachment inquiry is in some ways the culmination of a battle between the president and the government institutions he distrusted and disparaged.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Times reporters put it in the story text, \u201cThe House impeachment inquiry into Mr.Trump\u2019s efforts to force Ukraine to investigate Democrats is the climax of a 33-month scorched-earth struggle between a president with no record of public service and the government he inherited but never trusted.\u201d Leaving aside the requisite rapier thrust at the president (\u201cwith no record of public service\u201d), this is a pretty good summation of the Trump presidency\u2014the story of entrenched government bureaucrats and a president who sought to curb their power. Or, put another way, the story of a president who sought to rein in the deep state and a deep state that sought to destroy his presidency.\n\nBaker and his colleagues clearly think the president is on the ropes. They quote Virginia\u2019s Democratic Representative Gerald Connolly as saying the nation is headed toward a kind of \u201ckarmic justice,\u201d with the House impeachment inquiry now giving opportunity to once-anonymous officials to \u201cspeak out, speak up, testify about and against.\u201d\n\nConnolly and the Times reporters are probably right. The House seems headed inexorably toward impeachment. The president\u2019s struggle against the deep state appears now to be a lost cause. To prevail, he needed to marshal far more public support for his agenda\u2014including curtailment of the deep state\u2014than he proved capable of doing. He is a beleaguered president and is likely to remain so throughout the remainder of his term.\n\nThe reporters note that Trump sought from the beginning to minimize the role of career officials. He gave more ambassadorships to political appointees\u2014\u201dthe highest rate in history,\u201d say the reporters (without noting that Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Ronald Reagan weren\u2019t far behind). The result, they write, has been \u201can exodus from public service.\u201d They quote a \u201cnonpartisan organization\u201d saying the Trump administration lost nearly 1,200 senior career service employees in its first 18 months\u2014roughly 40 percent more than during President Barack Obama\u2019s first year and a half in office.\n\nThe reporters reveal a letter from 36 former foreign service officers to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo complaining that he had \u201cfailed to protect civil servants from political retaliation\u201d and citing the removal of U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Another letter signed by more than 270 former employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development expressed anger at the treatment of public servants and the president\u2019s \u201ccavalier (and quite possibly corrupt) approach to making foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe tone of the Times piece seems to suggest these expressions and actions constitute a kind of indictment of Trump. But a more objective appraisal would be that it is merely the outward manifestation of that \u201c33-month scorched-earth struggle\u201d the Times was talking about. Does a president have a right to fire an ambassador? How serious an offense is it when he appoints political figures to ambassadorships at a rate slightly higher than some previous presidents? If foreign policy careerists decide to leave the government because they don\u2019t like the president\u2019s effort to rein in foreign policy careerists, is that a black mark on the president\u2014or merely the natural result of a fundamental intragovernmental struggle?\n\nBut the Times reporters give the game away more explicitly in cataloguing a list of instances where those careerists sought to undermine the president because they found his policy decisions contemptible. \u201cWhile many career employees have left,\u201d writes the Times, \u201csome of those who stayed have resisted some of Mr. Trump\u2019s initiatives.\u201d When the president canceled large war games with South Korea, the military held them anyway\u2014only on a smaller scale and without fanfare. Diplomats negotiated an agreement before a NATO summit to foreclose any Trump action based on a different outlook. When the White House ordered foreign aid frozen this year, agency officials quietly worked with Congress to get it restored. State Department officials enlisted congressional allies to hinder Trump\u2019s efforts to initiate weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and other nations.\n\nFurther, as the Times writes, \u201cWhen transcripts of [Trump\u2019s] telephone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia were leaked, it convinced him that he could not trust the career staff and so records of subsequent call were stashed away in a classified database.\u201d And that was very early in his presidency, about the time Trump also learned there was a nasty dossier out there that was designed to provide grist for anyone interested in undermining or destroying his presidency.\n\nAnd of course, now governmental officials are lining up before the House impeachment panel to slam the president over his effort to get Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and his apparently related decision to hold up $391 million in security aid to Ukraine. As I have written in this space previously, this outlandish action by Trump constituted a profound lapse in judgment that was a kind of dare for opposition Democrats to fire off the impeachment cannon. And fire it off they have. \u201cNow,\u201d writes the Times, \u201c[Trump] faces the counteroffensive.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t take away from the central point of the Times story\u2014that Trump and the deep state have been in mortal combat since the beginning of his administration. And the stakes are huge.\n\nTrump wanted to restore at least somewhat cordial relations with Russia, whereas the deep state considered that the height of folly.\n\nTrump wanted to get out of Afghanistan, whereas the deep state totally opposed such a move.\n\nTrump viewed America\u2019s role in Syria as focused on defeating ISIS, whereas the deep state wanted to continue favoring the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nTrump was wary of letting events in Ukraine draw America into a direct confrontation with Russia, whereas the deep state wants to wrest Ukraine out of Russia\u2019s sphere of influence even if it means opening tensions with the Bear.\n\nTrump wanted to bring China to account for its widespread abuse of normal trading practices, whereas the deep state clung to \u201cfree trade\u2019\u2019 even in the face of such abuse.\n\nThese are big issues facing America. And the question hovering over the country as the impeachment drama proceeds is: are these matters open to debate in America? Or will the deep state suppress any such debate? And can a president\u2014any president\u2014pursue the Trump policy options without being subjected to the powerful yet subtle machinations of a wily bureaucracy bent on preserving its status and outlook?\n\nRobert W.
