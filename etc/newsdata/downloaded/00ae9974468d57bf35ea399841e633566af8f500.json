In exchange for the troop withdrawal, which would amount to more than one-third of the U.S. troop presence in the country, the Taliban has agreed to cut ties with al-Qaeda and provide counterterrorism guarantees.\n\nKhalilzad also said that the draft identifies the Taliban as the Islamic Emirate, the militant group\u2019s preferred name. But he said that implied no recognition of the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. U.S. officials have said previously that the name would identify the Taliban as a political party.\n\nAfghan government officials were briefed on the draft, Khalilzad said, but they were not given copies.\n\n\u201cIt is our agreement with the Taliban, not their agreement with the Taliban,\u201d he said, referring to the Afghan government. He declined to characterize the government\u2019s initial response.\n\nIt is not certain whether the agreement will be finalized.\n\nAbout 10 p.m. local time, toward the end of ToloNews\u2019s broadcast of the prerecorded Khalilzad interview, a truck bomb exploded close to the Green Village, a compound hosting international groups. The blast shook Kabul, and small-arms fire could be heard shortly after. When the bomb exploded, a fuel station nearby caught on fire, officials said.\n\nThe Taliban asserted responsibility for the attack, saying it had targeted \u201cforeign occupiers.\u201d The Interior Ministry said at least five civilians were killed and dozens injured.\n\nThe blast renewed fears of increased Taliban attacks ahead of any final deal.\n\nThis week, the Taliban attacked two major cities in northern Afghanistan, killing dozens of civilians and security forces, even as Khalilzad said a deal was close.\n\nKhalilzad flew to Kabul on Sunday after announcing on Twitter that he had wrapped up the latest round of peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar and that the two sides were on \u201cthe threshold\u201d of a deal. The United States and the Taliban have met for nine rounds of talks over 10 months.\n\nReports of the proposed partial troop withdrawal have been met with criticism from some of Trump\u2019s supporters, including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), and some national security advisers within the administration on grounds that the Taliban cannot be trusted and the United States would be giving up gains made during the 18-year war.\n\nOn Monday, Afghan presidential spokesman Sediq Seddiqi told reporters here that the government would review the proposal and offer feedback in the coming days. Khalilzad also met with Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah on Monday.\n\nThe Taliban has long demanded a complete withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan. U.S. officials have said that withdrawal will be \u201cconditions-based,\u201d but the Trump administration is hopeful that troops remaining after the initial drawdown will leave by late next year.\n\nLast week, Trump told Fox News Radio that his administration planned to reduce troop levels to about 8,600, but he did not offer a timeline for the withdrawal.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s presidential election is scheduled for Sept. 28, and incumbent Ashraf Ghani is up for a second term. The vote has been postponed twice already, but critics have urged Ghani to delay the election again, saying it could threaten the peace process. The independent electoral commission has also warned that about 2,000 polling places will be closed because of security issues. Abdullah, Ghani\u2019s top challenger in the contest, said this week that he would be willing to \u201cquit elections for the sake of peace.\u201d\n\nBut on Monday, Seddiqi reaffirmed plans to move forward with the vote.\n\nKaren DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nTaliban targets second Afghan city as U.S. negotiator says peace deal is near\n\nAn Afghan wedding attack adds tragic twist to peace talks\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Under the proposal, more than a third of U.S. troops in Afghanistan would leave within five months of the deal being signed.", "authors": ["Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady", "Worldviews Reporter", "Sharif Hassan", "Reporter Covering Afghanistan", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_prHziL7GVMdBiUOWVxN3hkjBug=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OKHCL6WNUMI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
