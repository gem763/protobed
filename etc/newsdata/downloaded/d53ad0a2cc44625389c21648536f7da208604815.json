The group also trimmed its 2019 free cash flow goal to reflect the revised delivery outlook.\n\nAirbus has been wrestling with delays to its A321 jets at its plant in Hamburg, Germany for around two years, and a top leasing industry executive said earlier on Wednesday that the situation showed no sign of improving.\n\nJohn Plueger, chief executive of Air Lease Corp, told the Airfinance Journal Asia Pacific 2019 conference that problems at the Hamburg plant were \"getting worse, not better\".\n\nAsked about Plueger's comments, an Airbus spokesman said: \"We are agreeing next deliveries with our customers.\" The discussions with customers were confidential, he added.\n\nTo reach its revised 2019 goal, Airbus must still hand over 289 planes in the final quarter, a little short of its record 297 deliveries in the same period last year.", "description": "Airbus said it expects to deliver \"around 860\" airliners in 2019 instead of the 880-890 previously targeted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106199533-1571865955660jet.jpg?v=1571865985", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
