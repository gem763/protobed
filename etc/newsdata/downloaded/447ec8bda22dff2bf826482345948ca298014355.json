REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado/File Photo\n\nThe project has run aground however, Codelco insiders and an executive said, as the miner realised it would struggle to guarantee its copper\u2019s sustainability once it left the mine to be melted down and taken to market. Without that, traders said, higher prices were unjustifiable.\n\nNow, the world\u2019s largest miner of the prized red metal told Reuters it would drop the \u201cgreen copper\u201d plan piloted in one of its smaller mines in favour of a broader initiative to make its product more sustainable.\n\nThe move by the influential copper giant could, if successful, pave the way for more significant industry-wide sustainability standards for the historically high-polluting copper mining trade, analysts said.\n\nBut the failure with more ambitious \u201cgreen copper\u201d also represents something of a setback for Codelco, which is already struggling with ageing mines and lower copper prices due to the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nJorge Sanhueza, Codelco\u2019s newly minted chief of climate change and traceable copper, told Reuters in an exclusive interview at the firm\u2019s Santiago headquarters that it would instead seek to ensure that all its production, upwards of 1.7 million tons a year, could be tracked and measured for sustainability within two years.\n\n\u201cWe have to get the deadlines approved by the board of directors but this is more ambitious than what we had before,\u201d said Sanhueza.\n\nCodelco\u2019s latest bid to ride the sustainable wave comes just weeks before Chile is due to host the United Nations\u2019 annual environmental summit, COP25, in December. Codelco did not disclose the estimated cost of the effort.\n\nHeavy industry globally and the South American nation\u2019s miners particularly are under pressure from governments and environmental groups to cut carbon emissions and make operations less resource-hungry.\n\nCustomers are also demanding products with a lower carbon footprint as scientific evidence mounts that emissions are driving climate change.\n\nNOT WORRYING ABOUT PRICE - FOR NOW\n\nA source linked to Codelco\u2019s commercial strategy said that the original plan had been to sell the \u201cgreen copper\u201d at a higher price, but that initiative was shelved.\n\nCopper traders told Reuters that Codelco had struggled to be able to certify its copper as traceable because once the ore left the mine, it still had to be driven to its markets, and transformed into cathodes in smelters largely powered by coal.\n\n\u201cSince there was no approved, industry-wide methodology (for sustainability) we were not willing to pay more for this copper,\u201d one trader, who asked for anonymity so as not to affect his commercial relationship with the firm, said. \u201cThat is why Codelco had to continue selling its copper without attracting a premium.\u201d\n\nSanhueza confirmed Codelco would set aside price differentiation for now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve refocused to an extent to be able to make a reality the issue of traceability within the short term and from that point move towards a copper which is produced with a lower carbon footprint and social cost,\u201d he said.\n\nAHEAD OF THEIR TIME\n\nRachel Bartels, a senior managing director at consultancy firm Accenture, said Codelco was \u201cahead of their time\u201d with its initiative at the one small mine but the company\u2019s eagerness could still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cYou need a tipping point and we\u2019re not quite there yet,\u201d she told Reuters in London.\n\n\u201cThey may not get a premium for it, but they may become the preferred supplier.\u201d\n\nTo \u201ctrace\u201d its copper, the company has set 75 parameters including water and clean energy use, gender equality and compliance with international labor regulations.\n\nAs there is at present no international benchmark for sustainable production of copper, it reviewed standards for other products such as aluminum and used guidelines from the industry-funded International Copper Association (ICA), Sanhueza said.\n\nCodelco is building a $1 billion desalination plant to supply its operations in the north of the country, and assessing its energy contracts for ways to strip carbon emissions from them, albeit without a set deadline to migrate completely to clean energies, Sanhueza said.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that one way or another, Codelco\u2019s contracts are going to be decarbonized,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state-owned miner faces another challenge to improve water recycling levels in its production processes. Although some of its mines in Chile\u2019s north have rates of almost 90%, that drops to 54% and 62% in its key Andina and El Teniente mines.\n\nAs well as its internal targets, Codelco and other miners have been told by government to provide concrete plans to cut emissions before the spotlight of COP25 arrives.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nIn recent weeks there has been a flurry of announcements. BHP Group Ltd has said that the world\u2019s largest copper mine, Escondida, will be run entirely on renewable energy while Anglo American Plc and French utility Engie have unveiled plans for hydrogen-powered lorries.\n\nJuan Carlos Guajardo, head of Santiago consultancy Plusmining, said Codelco\u2019s adventures in green copper highlighted that the industry was still grappling with sustainability best-practice.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t see a standard in place,\u201d he said.", "description": "In 2017, the world's largest copper producer - Chile's Codelco - announced a plan to sell \"green copper\" at a premium price to customers using more sustainable practices like renewable energy and recycled water to cut its carbon footprint.", "authors": ["Fabian Cambero", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441853037&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0ZF", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
