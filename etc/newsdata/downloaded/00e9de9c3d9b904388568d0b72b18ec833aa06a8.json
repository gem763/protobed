I\u2019m the last person in the world to order an almond-milk latte, and when I had my baby last fall, my mom made me a cheesecake and I ate the entire thing in a week. In December, though, I found out that my baby was allergic and I\u2019d have to completely eliminate it \u2014 including any and all foods where it\u2019s hidden as an ingredient \u2014 to continue breastfeeding, something I\u2019d always planned to do.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you why, but upon hearing the news, I asked my daughter\u2019s doctor, \u201cEven butter?\u201d She laughed. In my initial shock, the idea of giving up feta and yogurt made me sad, but the thought of dry toast in the morning or a northeastern winter without my signature browned-butter cookies made me choke up. In recent years, I\u2019ve grown particularly fond of European-style butters from brands like Vermont Creamery, Ronnybrook, and Straus (when I\u2019m visiting California). European butter is cultured, giving it a subtle, buttermilk-y flavor, and it has a higher fat content (a minimum of 82 percent butterfat), which makes it softer and creamier than your average American stick.\n\nI\u2019ve given up dairy once before, for a brief stint as a vegan in college. That\u2019s when soy milk was still cool, though, so I had a lot of sampling to do this time around. Things have improved in the dairy-free section \u2014 bless you, Oatly \u2014 but a lot of it is still processed garbage. After a few failures, it became less depressing to avoid the dairy impostors. But then I discovered Miyoko\u2019s European Style Cultured Vegan Butter.\n\nUnlike Earth Balance, which is, in my opinion, thoughtfully branded margarine, Miyoko\u2019s is made out of real ingredients like coconut oil and cultured cashews (which gives it a great tang that\u2019s slightly more intense than cultured butter\u2019s and makes me think it\u2019s good for my gut health). It\u2019s wrapped in wax paper, so it\u2019s a similar experience, and it comes in a nice eight-ounce block reminiscent of Kerrygold. It\u2019s salty, creamy, browns like butter, makes a phenomenal fried egg, and tastes insanely good melted on pancakes (I make them with Oatly), grilled corn, and my favorite sunflower-seed bread with creamy honey.\n\nThe texture is butter-esque, but more crumbly than creamy while it\u2019s cold, and because it\u2019s mostly coconut oil it tends to go soft even quicker on your countertop (making it ideal for spreading). I also love that it\u2019s from Northern California, which happens to be where my favorite all-time dairy bands are based (Cowgirl Creamery, Straus), so I feel like I\u2019m getting the good stuff. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s got the same warm flavor as true butter because, well, it isn\u2019t \u2014 but then again, my Alabama-born best friend, who knows a thing or two about butter, was fooled into eating Miyoko\u2019s for months by his health-freak boyfriend and was none the wiser. It\u2019s just that good.\n\nMiyoko\u2019s is even more expensive than craft European-style butters \u2014 at $8 for eight ounces, it\u2019s multiple dollars more than Ronnybrook or Vermont Creamery at my local Whole Foods. But if you\u2019re avoiding dairy or can\u2019t have it like me, it\u2019s worth the extra cost if you\u2019re craving. I\u2019d love to say that I use less of it and it lasts a long time, but I find myself eating even more of it than I did regular butter. It\u2019s just that addictive.\n\nMy only remaining test is if it holds up in baking, but for now, if I close my eyes while I eat my toast, it\u2019s just as good as Straus.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
