At the same time, the story liberally flashes back to the past and, just to add another degree of difficulty, frequently changes perspective as new characters -- or new versions of old ones -- keep joining the party.\n\nYes, some familiar players turn up eventually, although how and where is too spoiler-y to divulge.
