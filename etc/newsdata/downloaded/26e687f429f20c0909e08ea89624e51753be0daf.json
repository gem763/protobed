Are the Power Rankings why President Trump canceled his subscription?\n\nThe Commentary\n\nThe most important finding in this week\u2019s USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats is not Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s rise, Sen. Kamala D. Harris\u2019s fall or the fact that Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren are co-front-runners. It is that the number of undecided voters \u2014 a remarkable 29 percent \u2014 has risen by eight points since June. The political landscape is supposed to get clearer as time goes by and the electorate gets to know the candidates. Instead, it\u2019s getting murkier.\n\nThe fact is that nobody is dominating this race. The Biden campaign is leaking fuel but hanging in there. Warren has been on the rise, but not everyone is sold on Medicare-for-all \u2014 or her failure to explain how she\u2019ll pay for it. Sen. Bernie Sanders drew the biggest crowd of the year last weekend, but the rally was in Queens, which I think is pretty safe for any Democratic nominee. Buttigieg is smart, and Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar had good debates last week. But is any of them, or any of the other announced candidates, The One?\n\nThis kind of commitment-phobia leads inevitably to speculation that someone else may jump in at the last minute \u2014 some Big Name who could galvanize the party and give President Trump a drubbing in November.\n\nSources have been telling me for weeks that former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg is giving serious thought to making a run, especially if Biden falters. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio decided earlier this year to sit this one out but says he is being pressed to reconsider. Former attorney general Eric Holder has considered a presidential bid. Even former senator John Kerry \u2014 the Democratic nominee in 2004 \u2014 has reportedly mulled giving it another go.\n\nBut the two potential 11th-hour candidates who would make the biggest splash are the least likely to take the plunge. Sorry, folks, but I\u2019m quite confident Michelle Obama means it when she says there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll seek the privilege, or the burden, of moving her family back into the White House. And as for Hillary Clinton, well, I think she\u2019s just trolling Trump.\n\n\u2014 Eugene Robinson\n\nThe Ranking\n\nDon\u2019t forget to click on the chart\u2019s yellow highlighted text to see the rest of the Ranking Committee\u2019s annotations.\n\nPosition Challenger Change Over Last Ranking 1.

Michael Bloomberg RETURNS TO RANKING 10. Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014\n\nFalls off ranking: Beto O\u2019Rourke\n\nAlso receiving votes: Tom Steyer, Nancy Pelosi\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: Round 37 | The bull\u2019s eye just landed on someone new\n\nFrom the Annotations\n\nThe party is still even money, or better, to win, based on sheer anti-Trump sentiment among its base, but if they weren\u2019t freaking out, they wouldn\u2019t be Democrats, right? Charles Lane, on Michael Bloomberg and all the other non-candidates\n\nHe\u2019s back. I know everyone thinks he can\u2019t go the distance, and I know the new CNN poll could be an outlier, but it\u2019s clear that the anticipated collapse hasn\u2019t happened. Eugene Robinson, on Joe Biden\n\nAgree? Disagree? Share your thoughts in the comments. We\u2019ll see you for the next ranking. Until then, start prepping your stump speech.
