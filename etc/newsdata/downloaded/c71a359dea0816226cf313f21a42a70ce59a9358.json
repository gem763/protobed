Together, the trio have broad influence across the party \u2014 drawing millions of dollars from 23 party committees and organizations since the beginning of 2017, according to campaign finance filings and people familiar with their work.\n\nAD\n\nTheir dominance has alarmed other Republican Party strategists, who say the three have a disproportionate amount of sway \u2014 and have helped each other sustain that power, according to multiple people with knowledge of their roles.\n\nAD\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between Parscale \u2014 who as Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager regularly attacks the \u201cWashington swamp\u201d \u2014 and the low-profile GOP establishment couple speaks to how longtime party figures have acclimated to and benefited from the Trump era.\n\n\u201cWho else do I trust more than myself? The two people that I saw day after day, saying really smart things to me all the time, saying, \u2018Hey, Brad, you may think about this,\u2019 and they end up being right,\u201d Parscale said in an interview. \u201cIt has nothing to do with money. It was trust.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSince 2017, three businesses controlled by Walsh and Shields \u2014 including two companies formed after Trump\u2019s election \u2014 have collected $12.6 million from GOP political committees and politically active groups, according to campaign filings and tax records. The payments include expenses for overhead, staff and ad purchases on behalf of candidates.\n\nTheir businesses have been paid by almost every major arm of the GOP, including the Republican National Committee, the 2020 convention host committee, the official pro-Trump super PAC, the party\u2019s House and Senate committees, and the party\u2019s designated data broker, according to campaign filings and GOP operatives familiar with the payments.\n\nWalsh alone draws a monthly $25,000 consulting fee from the RNC, where she is a top adviser to Chairman Ronna McDaniel \u2014 totaling $300,000 a year. She has made $180,000 so far as a fundraiser for the 2020 Republican convention committee, records show. Since 2018, she has been paid more than $211,000 from a fundraising committee run by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), for which her husband also works as a senior consultant, records show.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWalsh has thrived despite a rocky relationship with Trump. In early 2017, she abruptly resigned from her job as White House deputy chief of staff. The president has complained about her as a \u201cleaker\u201d or as disloyal, multiple current and former administration officials said. In a meeting at the White House residence in August, Trump asked McDaniel about the work that Walsh is doing for the party, according to people familiar with the episode.\n\nThe White House declined to comment.\n\nStill, Walsh has won backers among members of Trump\u2019s inner circle, some of whom contacted The Washington Post, unprompted, with statements praising her and Shields.\n\n\u201cKatie was one of the unsung heroes of the 2016 campaign and has been a great partner in working toward the President\u2019s reelection in 2020,\u201d said Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior White House adviser.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcCarthy called Shields \u201cone of the most talented political minds I know.\u201d\n\nWalsh, Shields and Parscale said their actions have been guided by a desire to help the party and Trump succeed.\n\n\u201cI believe I am at the RNC due to my experience as a former RNC chief of staff when we elected President Trump and because of the trust that the chairwoman and Brad have in me,\u201d Walsh said.\n\nShields noted that he has worked in politics for 25 years in a variety of roles and helped to build the party\u2019s current data program. \u201cChange agents always face detractors,\u201d he said.\n\nLess than three years after coming to town, Parscale is now a major player in Washington. GOP political committees paid his companies $34 million since 2017, campaign filings show. Of that, Parscale said he has retained about $400,000 in fees, while the rest went to ad purchases and expenses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo longtime GOP leaders, the trio\u2019s reach is emblematic of the party\u2019s overreliance on an elite consultant class.\n\n\u201cA select few people benefit from the way the system is currently run, and the sad part is, it is allowed to exist,\u201d said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. The RNC declined to respond.\n\nA referral business\n\nThe trio\u2019s working relationship began in 2016. When Trump became the GOP nominee, Walsh, then the RNC\u2019s 31-year-old chief of staff, helped Parscale develop the campaign\u2019s general-election strategy, regularly spending four days a week at Trump Tower in New York.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, Parscale also came to lean on Shields, who helped rebuild the party\u2019s data infrastructure after Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election, said people familiar with their relationship.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWalsh and Shields met through their work in Republican politics. She was a longtime party fundraiser who became the top staff member to then-RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. Shields preceded her in the same job after holding senior roles at the National Republican Congressional Committee. He also led the Congressional Leadership Fund, a group supporting the House GOP.\n\nThey became engaged on New Year\u2019s Eve 2016 at 10 Downing Street in London, as a result of his connections in England, where he lived as a child. Their wedding in Charleston, S.C., the next year was attended by the party\u2019s upper echelon, including Parscale.\n\nAt the time, Parscale \u2014 a onetime San Antonio Web marketer and Washington neophyte \u2014 was handling several roles as one of the new president\u2019s most trusted representatives. He was a point of contact for the RNC, where he had come aboard as a consultant. He was gatekeeper for one of the Trump campaign\u2019s most valuable assets: its data on supporters and donors. And he took a central role in helping to set up two groups that could accept checks of unlimited size to support Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was serving as an unofficial agent for the Trump family,\u201d Parscale said.\n\nShields and Walsh guided him along the way.\n\nWhen it came to setting up the two pro-Trump groups, America First Action and America First Policies, the couple advised the hiring of their close friend and colleague Brian O. Walsh (no relation to Katie Walsh) as president, said people familiar with the recommendation. Parscale passed the suggestion on to the groups\u2019 board, the people said.\n\nThe new groups, under Brian O. Walsh, then hired the firms of the three operatives.\n\nIn 2017, America First Policies paid Katie Walsh\u2019s firm Laymont Group $225,000 for fundraising, tax records show.\n\nWalsh said in a statement that she worked with America First Policies because she thought \u201cit was critically important\u201d to help \u201cfight the liberal media\u2019s effort to derail the President\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nAmerica First also paid Convergence Media $25,000, records show, along with nearly $2 million to run ads, for which the company retained a percentage as a fee. Shields said the work was done by Rob Simms, his business partner, noting that their firm was one of nearly 20 vendors the group hired in 2018.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nParscale Strategy received nearly $3 million from the two groups, records show.\n\nOnce he became Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, Parscale was not allowed to coordinate with the independent groups. But a separate company he owns, Red State Data and Digital, which is legally firewalled off from the campaign, has continued to do work for the super PAC, according to filings and a person familiar with the arrangement.\n\nBrian O. Walsh, who had previously run the Congressional Leadership Fund, said the trio helped make the organizations successful.\n\n\u201cWe hired talented, experienced, loyal people who were committed to our mission, paid them a fair market rate, and the end result is two successful organizations, a winning record in the midterms \u2014 and this crappy article,\u201d he said in a statement to The Post.\n\nThe senior adviser role\n\nIn 2017, the RNC elected a new chairwoman, McDaniel, a former chair of the Michigan GOP and a niece of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), whom Katie Walsh had recommended for the job, said people familiar with her role. That summer, Walsh became a senior adviser for the party, where she is involved in many major decisions, former officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAs she has served in that role, there has been consternation inside the party about RNC contracts that have gone to her allies, said multiple former party officials.\n\n\u201cWith Brad and Katie and Brad and Mike, they so often come as a package,\u201d said a Republican operative familiar with their work, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution.\n\nMonths after Walsh rejoined the RNC as a consultant, the party began paying Parscale\u2019s firm to place its ads on digital platforms, according to filings and those familiar with the arrangement.\n\nIn all, the national party has paid Parscale Strategy $25 million since 2017, filings show. The vast majority of the money was passed along to buy ads, said Parscale, who said his firm kept a fee of 1.5 percent of the ad purchases.\n\nParscale\u2019s firm helped the RNC purchase digital ads at a reduced cost, RNC spokesman Mike Reed said. That arrangement ended in August amid scrutiny about how much money was flowing to the firm owned by the president\u2019s campaign manager. All RNC digital buys are now made directly through host sites to \u201censure complete transparency,\u201d Reed said.\n\nThe RNC also hired Shields\u2019s business partner, Simms, to consult on House races in 2018, paying him through St. James Strategies, said people familiar with the deal.\n\nPublic records do not indicate who controls St. James. Simms said that because the RNC was hiring him individually, he set up the separate company \u201cfor legal and compliance reasons.\u201d\n\nWalsh told The Post that she had no role in RNC\u2019s hiring of Simms or Parscale.\n\nAn RNC spokesman said Walsh had \u201cno oversight or involvement\u201d in the vendor selection process.\n\n\u201cKatie and her years of experience at the RNC are an invaluable asset to our team,\u201d McDaniel said in a statement. \u201cLike all our consultants, she provides advice and makes recommendations, some of which we take and some of which we don\u2019t. Ultimately, my chief of staff and I make all of the RNC\u2019s investment decisions.\u201d\n\nMcDaniel also recommended Walsh as a fundraiser for the RNC\u2019s 2020 convention, according to people familiar with the situation, including Louis DeJoy, the host committee\u2019s national finance chair. DeJoy said McDaniel was among many who recommended Walsh.\n\nWalsh has been paid $180,000 for the convention work so far through Red Strategy Group, which is not listed under her name but shares her phone number, as the Center for Public Integrity first reported.\n\n'There is still right and wrong'\n\nShields, meanwhile, has taken on a broad range of clients at Convergence Media, the consulting firm he and Simms began in early 2017. Since then, it has been hired by two major fundraising committees for House Republicans and independent groups such as With Honor, a super PAC backed by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, filings show. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nSome campaigns and candidates have said they felt pressure to hire Convergence to get access to Trump\u2019s list of supporters, which was being rented in late 2018 through Excelsior Strategies, a company set up by a Convergence executive, according to records and people familiar with the situation. Shields said the project helped GOP campaigns nationwide raise money and generated little revenue.\n\nMeanwhile, Parscale and McDaniel urged GOP campaigns to hire Convergence, according to four people familiar with the discussions.\n\nAmong the clients was the campaign of Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis, which first contacted Parscale to see if he could help at a time of deep tensions between the Trump and DeSantis camps, according to people familiar with the situation. Parscale declined, but recommended Shields\u2019s firm, which was then hired to place millions in television and digital ads, filings show.\n\nAfter the election, Florida state party officials contacted Walsh for fundraising help, and she recommended her husband\u2019s firm, which was hired for a short-term contract in 2019, according to people familiar with the arrangement. Shields said his firm made only $4,000.\n\nMeanwhile, McDaniel and her staff pushed for Convergence to be hired to make television ads for the Senate campaign of Cindy Hyde-Smith in Mississippi, said people involved in the discussions. Campaign officials resisted, and some close to her campaign were concerned about such a specific request by the national party at a time when Hyde-Smith was seeking Trump\u2019s endorsement and RNC support, according to the people.\n\n\u201cI know this is politics, but there is still right and wrong,\u201d said one Republican operative involved in the Mississippi campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nBrad White, Hyde-Smith\u2019s chief of staff, said that he remembered the RNC request but that he never considered it a threat to the campaign to withhold resources.\n\n\u201cI think it was all about, \u2018We want to make sure you have good commercials,\u2019 \u201d White said.\n\nAfter Hyde-Smith qualified for the runoff, the RNC transferred $1 million to the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) \u2014 along with a specific request that the money be used to hire Convergence to make ads for the race, said three people familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe Senate committee ultimately paid Convergence $229,500 for that race, in addition to $1.2 million for other races and consulting, according to public records.\n\n\u201cConvergence was honored to be a trusted vendor for the NRSC on winning races in North Dakota, Tennessee and Mississippi,\u201d said Shields, who said the firm netted about $41,000 for its Mississippi work.\n\nA spokesman for McDaniel said there was no tie between the RNC\u2019s support for Hyde-Smith and the hiring of Convergence, adding that the special election was a \u201cmust-win race\u201d for the party.", "description": "The symbiotic relationship between Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s outspoken 2020 campaign manager, and GOP establishment couple Katie Walsh and Mike Shields speaks to how longtime party operatives have benefited from the Trump era.", "authors": ["Michelle Ye Hee Lee", "National Political Enterprise", "Accountability Reporter Covering Money", "Influence In Politics", "Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wYWcnXwFfRq6oaxMbhdnuOBYyOI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FWNC4HF7YUI6TKFQP3MKBVO4LU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
