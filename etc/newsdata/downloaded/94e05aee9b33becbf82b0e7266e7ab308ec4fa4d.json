(Julio Cortez/AP)\n\nATLANTA \u2014 The back of the Washington Nationals\u2019 rotation continues to shift, this time because Joe Ross is experiencing right forearm pain and can\u2019t pitch Saturday night against the Braves at SunTrust Park. Austin Voth will start in his place.\n\nRoss, 26, felt forearm soreness during his regular between-starts bullpen session this week. He has been the team\u2019s fifth starter for a few turns now after winning that spot over Erick Fedde but had his worst outing of the season Monday against the New York Mets.\n\nManager Dave Martinez expects Voth, 27, to throw 75 to 80 pitches and hopes the right-hander can complete five innings. Fedde will back up Voth, who had success against the Braves earlier this season \u2014 six innings, two runs June 23. Voth was the fifth starter before going to the injured list with right shoulder tendinitis in July. He then began a lengthy rehab process that sent him through the Gulf Coast League before he made two starts for the Class AA Harrisburg Senators.\n\nVoth\u2019s success varied during his recovery. And his next task is to hold down one of baseball\u2019s best lineups in the middle of a pennant race.\n\nRoss\u2019s forearm was not the only injury news for the Nationals on Friday. They will also be without utility infielder Adri\u00e1n Sanchez for a few days as he recovers from a stomach virus. And Roenis El\u00edas has a tweaked right hamstring after exiting in the eighth inning of a 4-2 loss here Thursday night. El\u00edas strained his hamstring Aug. 2 and missed close to a month. This time, the pain is just above where he felt it the first time, he said Friday, and he probably will undergo an MRI exam Saturday. The Nationals are waiting an extra day so the swelling doesn\u2019t obscure the results.\n\n\u201cI definitely feel more optimistic with the results,\u201d El\u00edas said Friday, through a team interpreter, when asked to compare his pain to the August injury. \u201cAs you saw last night, I walked off the field fine. Once I felt it, I kind of bent over a little bit, but the first time I injured it I almost had to be helped off the field with how bad it hurt.\n\n\u201cBut more than anything I\u2019m just frustrated. I\u2019m trying to help the team any way I can, to help us win, and I keep getting these little nagging injuries. But just have to stay positive.\u201d\n\n[The Nationals need to solidify their left-handed specialist situation \u2014 and fast]\n\nWithout El\u00edas, the Nationals\u2019 bullpen is down to one left-handed reliever in Sean Doolittle. Doolittle, typically the team\u2019s closer, came off the injured list Sept. 1 and is working back to high-leverage spots. Martinez said Friday that El\u00edas\u2019s injury could push Doolittle into those situations sooner than expected. The Braves have Freddie Freeman, one of the league\u2019s most feared lefties, and Washington has limited options to match up with him. Doolittle is one. Another is Wander Suero, a right-hander with good reverse splits and a cutter that rides in on lefties.\n\nBut Martinez really just needs El\u00edas healthy for the stretch run of this season. The team traded for him July 31 to face lefties in big moments, and so far he either has struggled or been unavailable.\n\nLINEUPS\n\nNationals (78-61)\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nHowie Kendrick 2B\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nMichael A.
