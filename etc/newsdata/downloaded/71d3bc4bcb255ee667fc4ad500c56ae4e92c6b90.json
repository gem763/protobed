Yusuf Abdourahman, a security official with the Lower Shabelle regional administration, told The Associated Press that a suicide car bomber detonated a vehicle packed with explosives at the gate of a military airstrip that serves as a base for U.S. and Somali forces.\n\nHe said a burst of gunfire could be heard across the base after the bombing, suggesting an ongoing attack on the facility.\n\nSomalia's Islamic extremist rebels, al-Shabab, claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe U.S. military uses Belidogle airstrip in the Lower Shabelle region as a base where it launches drones that attack al-Shabab and trains Somali troops. AFRICOM confirmed a strike by U.S. drones about two weeks ago in support of Somali forces who came under attack by al-Shabab militants while on patrol in Lower Juba province.\n\nHow drones could save lives in Somalia's battle against al-Shabab\n\nThere was no information immediately provided by the U.S. military's Africa Command (AFRICOM) on the incident at Belidogle.\n\nAl-Shabab, which often exaggerates its battlefield operations, claimed in a statement posted online that the attack began with multiple explosives-laden trucks, which it said had allowed a group of militants to get into the base where they \"engaged American troops.\"\n\nThere were reports of a second attack on European Union peacekeepers in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. A Reuters journalist reported seeing a seriously damaged armored vehicle with a small Italian flag on it after an explosion that apparently targeted an EU convoy. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nAl-Shabab was behind the brazen assault on a shopping and hotel complex in Nairobi, Kenya, in January that left more than 20 people dead, including one American man.\n\nKenya cracks down on Al-Shabaab terror group\n\nKenyan intelligence officials told CBS News that the al-Shabab cell in Kenya behind that attack had been scouting the upmarket dusitD2 hotel complex for at least two years.", "description": "Belidogle airstrip is used by U.S. drones to target the al-Shabab militant group, which has claimed the attack on the base", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/30/f543b2e5-4449-42f3-a9cc-21c7cb2ae64b/thumbnail/1200x630/f2b781cf22cbd4bf8dd8e9b752cbddfe/somalia-amisom-troops-1171006408.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
