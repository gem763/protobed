Giuliani alleged that Biden was attempting to help his son, Hunter Biden, who had financial connections in Ukraine. Giuliani doubled down on those points in a contentious interview Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d arguing that Viktor Shokin, the former prosecutor, has been falsely tarred.\n\nShokin left office in March 2016. Biden has aggressively denied the allegation that he did anything inappropriate.\n\nSaying he didn\u2019t \u201crecall all of the specifics about the specific individuals,\" Cameron didn\u2019t directly address what Biden may or may not have said as President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, but said that the West was working hard at that time to get Ukraine to clean up its notoriously corrupt government. The West was heavily involved in Ukraine at the time because of its ongoing conflict with Russia, which had seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, an invasion roundly condemned by the international community.\n\nDefenders of Biden have said that what Biden did in pushing Ukraine\u2019s leadership was in line with those goals.\n\n\u201cUkraine cannot afford the people to lose hope again,\u201d Biden said in addressing the topic of corruption in a December 2015 visit, referring to corruption as a \u201ccancer.\"\n\nCameron\u2019s appearance on Zakaria\u2019s show was designed to promote his new book \u201cFor the Record,\u201d which focuses extensively on his thoughts on Brexit.\n\nWhen asked by Zakaria whether he had any regrets about allowing a referendum to be held on Britain\u2019s status in the European Union, Cameron admitted he did, even though he thought the Brexit vote \u201cwas inevitable\" and that there were issues to be resolved.\n\n\u201cI feel huge sadness and regrets about the situation we're in now, and the difficulties we face,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI mean they will come to an end. We will solve this. But when I look back, as I do in the book, lots of regrets of things I could have done differently. Perhaps a better negotiation, perhaps a different timing.\"\n\nCameron also told Zakaria he thought the Trump administration made a mistake in pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement \u2014 which was negotiated during his tenure as prime minister, with his assistance \u2014 without a new deal in place.\n\n\u201cThe trouble with getting out of it is you're replacing something with huge uncertainty,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cBy all means try and improve on the deal, try and make sure that it runs on for longer. But actually walking away from it, without a real answer, I think actually makes the world less safe rather than more safe.\"", "description": "Former UK leader says Britain believed Kyiv needed to crack down on corruption.", "authors": ["David Cohen", "David M.
