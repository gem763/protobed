Meanwhile, a political and humanitarian crisis has converged with civil conflict that have sent the economy into a deep downturn.\n\nJuan Andres Mejia, deputy of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly and Commissioner of a plan created to revitalize Venezuela\u2019s economy and petroleum industry, said international sanctions and the financial collapse brought on by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had left the country\u2019s key economic driver deeply underfunded.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to recover the Venezuelan oil industry and Venezuela as a whole without the aid of the private sector,\u201d Mejia told Yahoo Finance on the sidelines of the United General Assembly in New York. \u201cVenezuela cannot increase its oil production if it wants to control all of its oil production as it is right now.\u201d\n\nThe country is home to the world\u2019s largest oil reserves and at its peak in 2014 produced nearly 3 million barrels a day, according to OPEC data, which accounted for 90% of Venezuela\u2019s export revenue.\n\nYet those volumes have since fallen dramatically, following the collapse of global oil prices and economic pressure enacted to pressure the Maduro regime. Earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on state-owned oil company PDVSA, cutting off exports to the U.S. market.\n\nThat has pushed oil production down to 600,000 barrels a day, according to Mejia.\n\nFILE - In this Aug. 27, 2012 file photo, workers of the state oil company, PDVSA, watch a fire that rises over the Amuay refinery near Punto Fijo, Venezuela.

Despite international opposition to Maduro\u2019s rule, Mejia said that the country needs assistance from global institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank.\n\n\u201cThis is not about one person. This is about a recovery plan that will last for years to come.\u201d\n\nCreating a \u2018democratic system\u2019\n\nMore than 4 million Venezuelans have been displaced under the Maduro regime, making it the largest humanitarian crisis in Latin American history, according to the United Nations Human Commission for Refugees. The UN projects the exodus will surpass that of the 6 million Syrian refugees next year, yet Venezuela has received a small fraction of the humanitarian aid internationally, in part because of concerns Maduro may interfere with distribution.\n\nOn Wednesday, the State Department committed $36 million in humanitarian aid dedicated to a U.N. program, while setting aside $52 million separately to fund Guaido\u2019s government operations.\n\nMejia said funding the reconstruction of its oil industry, is half the battle. It also requires opening up the country\u2019s energy sector to foreign investment, reversing the industry\u2019s nationalization under late President Hugo Chavez.\n\nThe opposition-controlled Congress is currently considering a proposal that would allow private companies to hold majority stakes in joint ventures with PDVSA, according to Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a democratic system, we want to create political stability in order to open our economy to private companies including foreign investments and national investments,\u201d said Carlos Vecchio, the Ambassador to the U.S. for the Interim Government of Venezuela.\n\n\u201cWe will use the oil sector to boost our stability and to also bring social stability so they people can stand in line to take advantage of the economic opportunities that we will create,\u201d he added.\n\nYahoo Finance's All Markets Summit on October 10 More\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
