On Lucky Catch Cruises in Portland, Maine, the crew invites you out to trap your own lobster, have it cooked at a nearby restaurant and enjoy it with hot melted butter right on the spot.\n\nLucky Catch's lobster tours last for 80 to 90 minutes and passengers can take part in hauling up the traps or have a seat and relax while the boat cruises by beautiful lighthouses, historic civil war forts and the \"Seal Rocks.\"\n\nLucky Catch began taking passengers out on the bay to show them the work of a real lobsterman back in '90s when they realized people had a real interest in learning the tricks of the trade. \"The excitement of catching your own fresh lobster and taking it home or having it sent to friends was too delicious to resist,\" the founder, Captain Tom, shared on the boat's website.\n\nLobstering, as catching lobsters is officially called, is a sustainable sport; lobsters that are too small, too big or carrying eggs are thrown back. On Lucky Catch, the one's that are just right are available for purchase and can be taken to the Portland Lobster Company restaurant right across the pier to be cooked and served with sides like corn on the cob and coleslaw.\n\nCheck out the video above to see how our own lobster tour went!
