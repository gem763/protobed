It\u2019s a two-ton whimsy about Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), a ten-year-old German cherub during World War II, so fascinated with Der F\u00fchrer, the leader of his country\u2019s ideals, that he envisions Adolf Hitler as his imaginary friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs played by Taika Waititi, Funny Adolf behaves childishly and runs alongside Jojo with gangly, clown-like gestures during an outing with Hitlerjugend troops. Although given to making angry-face speeches about Aryan superiority and silly anti-Jewish pronouncements, Funny Adolf represents Jojo\u2019s ignorance of Third Reich ideology and his pre-adolescent hero-worship.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, writer-director Taika Waititi, best known for the Marvel movie Thor: Ragnarok, hasn\u2019t made Hitler a superhero on the right side of history; instead, Waititi\u2019s calculated political correctness lampoons political idolatry as immature, low-information folly. Jojo Rabbit ought to expose the projection of fears and self-loathing that\u2019s become the common feature of far-left ideology, but it avoids that realization and settles for being a zeitgeist satire that targets the political infatuation of others, not your own.\n\nNo wonder Jojo Rabbit won over award-season shills at the recent Toronto Film Festival, where it took the same audience prize as last year\u2019s Green Book. Award-givers have become as obtuse as little Jojo in conflating political self-righteousness with artistic excellence. This foolishness recalls what Pauline Kael ridiculed as \u201cNazi junkie\u201d movies; only now it happens with flicks about identity politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaititi follows trends through a third-rate sensibility; as in his breakthrough film Hunt for the Wilderpeople, he strives toward banal idiosyncrasy in Jojo Rabbit. Its Third Reich setting is presented in deliberately artificial, childlike context, although intended to appeal to adult sophistication. Each character is lovably idiosyncratic, from innocent Jojo, his freedom-loving mother (Scarlett Johansen), and his HJ commander (Sam Rockwell) to his roly-poly best friend Yorki (Archie Yates) and the teenage Jewish savant Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) hiding in a crawlspace inside the bedroom of Jojo\u2019s late sister, like Anne Frank. They inhabit the brightly colored storybook compositions \u2013Wes Anderson knockoffs, straining toward the eccentricity of Jared Hess figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcclaim for Jojo Rabbit indicts our pathetic film culture that refused to acknowledge the ingenuity of Anderson and Hess\u2019s best films (respectively The Darjeeling Limited and Gentlemen Broncos). Waititi\u2019s simplistic view of human behavior and political history isn\u2019t even as sophisticated as Indiana Jones\u2019s witty cultural summation: \u201cNazis \u2014 I hate those guys!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJojo Rabbit blends the ahistorical idiocy of Tarantino\u2019s WWII folly Inglourious Basterds with the far-left imperative to demonize through ridicule. (Nazis weren\u2019t really funny in Mel Brooks\u2019s The Producers, and they weren\u2019t merely funny in Lubitsch\u2019s To Be or Not to Be.) Waititi\u2019s gimmick evokes the recent \u201cpunch a Nazi\u201d meme, a feature of the #Resistance following the 2016 election. Jojo eventually outgrows his childish identification with power and rejects his demented role model (\u201cF*** off, Hitler!\u201d), and the childishness of this predictable, crowd-pleasing moment confirms Waititi\u2019s unsophisticated response to contemporary political idolatry.\n\nWaititi makes warped populism cute. Jojo gets his titular nickname when he runs away from a Hitlerjugend dare to kill a fuzzy wabbit \u2014 ending with a grenade accident that leaves him cutely scared and with a Forrest Gump limp. His mother advises him to be shrewd and wily like a woodland creature, and his attraction to the Jewish Elsa helps contradict the anti-Jewish rhetoric he\u2019s heard without being able to process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJojo Rabbit reduces Nazism to na\u00efve modern Hollywood morality. Even Rockwell\u2019s \u201csympathetic\u201d Nazi is conveniently gay. When he pretends to repeat ethnic calumny and suggests that \u201csomeone should write a book on the subject,\u201d the line is so poorly planted that it seems like another snarky reference (this time to Mein Kampf); it barely registers on Jojo, who fills a drawing pad with his kindergarten daydreams about Hitler, Jewry, and his own childhood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis m\u00e9lange symbolizes Waititi\u2019s self-congratulatory project. His sentimental ploys lack the emotional purity of the boy\u2019s tale in Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u2019s wondrous Young and Prodigious T. S. Spivet, and the offensive use of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d is worse than merely anachronistic. Somehow Waititi mongrelizes Gunther Grass\u2019s The Tin Drum and then fails the critique of idol-worship that made Marco Bellocchio\u2019s Vincere \u2014 with its full-out correction of Mussolini\u2019s impact on the romantic imagination of a subjected populace \u2014 a perfect allegory for Obama-era idolatry. Vincere is a major film that never became a great zeitgeist movie because its warning was out of step with \u201cprogress.\u201d Jojo Rabbit is minor, but its zeitgeist appeal as childish political projection insults us all.", "description": "Taika Waititi's film ought to expose the projection of fears and self-loathing that\u2019s become the common feature of far-left ideology, but it avoids that realization and settles for being a zeitgeist satire that targets the political infatuation of others.", "authors": ["Armond White", "Kevin D.
