She added it was a \"popular policy\" and she \"fully supports\" it.\n\nAnd she defended a string of other divisive aspects of the benefit system - drawing anger from campaigners who were hoping for a focus on reform.\n\nLabour MP Neil Coyle blasted: \"You are quite prepared and are comfortable with children today being forced to rely on handouts, food banks and living in destitution?\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMs Coffey told the MP: \"It's not a con sequitur\" [something that logically follows from something else]. Mr Coyle replied: \"It\u2019s the reality! And if you\u2019re not comfortable with reality that\u2019s a big problem!\"\n\nThe two-child limit prevents parents claiming Child Tax Credits or Universal Credit for \"third or subsequent\" children born after 6 April 2017 - a cut of up to \u00a32,780 per child.\n\nMs Coffey revealed she was in \"active discussion\" about \"another sticking plaster\" to help people with housing costs under the two-child cap.\n\nPrevious plans to extend the cap to kids born before 2017 have already been scrapped.\n\nBut she resisted claims it had driven poverty.\n\nMs Coffey said: \"You\u2019re trying to say it\u2019s a causal link.\" Mr Coyle fumed: \"There is a causal link between the policy and destitution and poverty. Yes. Absolutely. 100%.\"\n\n(Image: UK Parliament)\n\n\"I\u2019m not sure I agree with that assertion,\" the Tory DWP chief replied. Mr Coyle shot back: \"Well then you\u2019re not accepting reality!\"\n\nIt came as Ms Coffey faced a stormy two-hour grilling from MPs on the Work and Pensions Committee a month after replacing Amber Rudd, who quit over Brexit .\n\nThere were angry exchanges as she:\n\nRefused to guarantee the benefit freeze will end in April;\n\nClaimed Universal Credit is \"working\" in her seat with a score of \"9.9/10\";\n\nClaimed forcing UC claimants to borrow an advance from their own future benefits to bridge a 5-week gap \"actually works\";\n\nRevealed officials are looking at making the Universal Credit work allowance more generous;\n\nBut refused to introduce automatic split payments to couples on UC, despite fears abuse victims are being financially controlled;\n\nAnd refused to say how many DWP staff are forced to rely on benefits themselves, claiming it was \"personal data\";\n\nConfirmed a review of benefit sanctions will be published by Christmas;\n\nConfirmed DWP is now investigating 85,000 suspected advance payment frauds after Universal Credit claimants fell victim to a scam;\n\nConfirmed 20,000 severely disabled people unlawfully lost out on cash when they moved to UC. So far 14,000 have been repaid an average of \u00a32,280 each.\n\nMs Coffey was questioned in her first hearing at the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, where she claimed she would take a scientific approach to benefits.\n\n(Image: UK Parliament)\n\nShe spoke of \"product lines\" and a \"balance sheet\" in analysing whether welfare is working - despite a tide of human stories about failures in the system.\n\n\"I\u2019m the only person in government who\u2019s got a PhD in science,\" she told MPs. \"I\u2019m driven a lot by data analysis and really trying to get to the nitty gritty.\"\n\nMs Coffey boasted Universal Credit is working fine in her own rural seat - despite an avalanche of complaints from deprived areas.\n\n\"In Suffolk Coastal? 9.9 out of 10. No question. It\u2019s working,\" she said.\n\nShe also defended the advance payment system under Universal Credit - which makes families borrow against future benefits while they wait five weeks for payment.\n\nLib Dem MP Heidi Allen fumed: \"Just objectively, imagine living on such a tiny amount of money that is not enough to live on, and then you\u2019ve got to pay some of it back? How can that work?\n\n\"I\u2019m talking about people with no food in the cupboard, not a penny in the bank.\"\n\nCommittee chair Frank Field added: \"I see people who are hungry and who are driven to destitution... It's pretty grim.\"\n\n(Image: UK Parliament)\n\nMs Coffey refused to confirm the four-year benefit freeze will end in April - despite an inflation-busting 3.9% rise in the state pension.\n\nShe told MPs the DWP is in talks with the Treasury over 120 benefit rates. But she added: \"Until I get the analysis which is due before the end of the month, then I won\u2019t be in a position to say exactly what we\u2019ll do on every single product line.\u201d\n\nShe added: \"I think there\u2019s a general desire from the PM to see how we have that increased prosperity and how we then share the benefits of increased prosperity with everyone in society.\n\n\"I can\u2019t give you a definitive outcome. We\u2019re looking very carefully right now on what we can do about the benefits going forward from 2020.\"\n\n(Image: UIG via Getty Images)\n\nMs Coffey said she was in talks to raise the 'work allowance' in Universal Credit - the amount people can earn before their benefits are tapered away. Last year it was made \u00a31,000 a year more generous.\n\nMs Coffey said: \"I think it\u2019s important that we need to see what the outcomes are that we want.\n\n\"So consideration about things like increasing the work allowance on Universal Credit before the taper kicks in - trying to do what we can about that element as well.\n\n\"Those sorts of analysis is ongoing.\"\n\nBut the DWP chief refused committee chief Frank Field's calls to disclose how many of the department's own staff are relying on welfare due to low wages.\n\n\"That\u2019s personal data. We can\u2019t do that Frank,\" she said.\n\nAnd she refused calls to introduce automatic \"split payments\" for couples on UC, to avoid domestic abusers hoarding the cash.\n\nShe said other reforms have already been brought in, but added: \"I think it\u2019s not going to be our intention to introduce split payments by default.\u201d\n\nLast year the Mirror reported just 15 couples had opted for split payments. But Ms Coffey said: \"I think it\u2019s best if we allow the families and households to decide that.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the hearing, the DWP also confirmed 20,000 severely disabled people lost out when they moved to Universal Credit before January this year.\n\nIt was previously thought just over 13,000 people were affected.\n\nGiving an update to MPs, officials said 20,000 Severe Disability Premium claimants had been affected and will now receive a back payment.\n\nSome 14,000 have already received back payments averaging \u00a32,280 each, with 6,000 still to go.", "description": "Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey attacked claims the two-child limit has caused destitution in a stormy hearing before the Work and Pensions Committee", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Getty Images", "Uk Parliament", "Uig Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20590582.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-112959.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
