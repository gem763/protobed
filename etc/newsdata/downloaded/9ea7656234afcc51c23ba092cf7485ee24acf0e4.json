Michelle Waterson at UFC on ESPN+ 19: Best photos view 12 images\n\nMichelle Waterson is an all-heart fighter who was once Invicta FC champion at 105 pounds. Joanna Jedrzejczyk is a former UFC strawweight champion who spent much of her career at 125 pounds.\n\nAnd that size discrepancy made all the difference when the two skilled foes square off in the main event of UFC on ESPN+ 19 on Saturday night.\n\nWaterson, as always, proved a game foe and had her moments, but Jedrzejczyk\u2019s size and strength ultimately proved too much as she rolled to a unanimous-decision victory. The judges\u2019 scores at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla., were 50-45, 50-45 and 49-46.\n\nThe former 115-pound champ set the tone in the opening round, as she managed to goad Waterson into the clinch. Waterson (17-7 MMA, 5-3 UFC)landed knees and occasional elbows, but not as often or with as much force as Jedrjezczyk (16-3 MMA, 10-3 UFC), who dictated where the fight moved.\n\nThis continued in the second, and as Jedrzejczyk started to wear her foe down, she began implementing the vaunted kicking game which led to her championship run.\n\nIn the third, Waterson showed why she\u2019s become a fan favorite. She continued to eat shots for most of the round, but in the final minute, she electrified the crowd by shooting for the takedown and swiftly transitioning to a rear-naked choke that nearly ended the fight.\n\nBut Jedrzejczyk survived the round, then went back to her kicking game in the fourth, and added her first takedown of the fight for good measure.\n\nComing out for the fifth, it was clear Jedrzejczyk had a badly swollen right foot. Jedrzejczyk, who landed more than 200 strikes in the fight, went back to punching and clinching. Waterson looked for a comeback finish right up until the fight\u2019s final moments, and got her opponent\u2019s back one more time, but she never quite turned the fight in her favor.\n\nWith her 11th career decision victory, Jedrzejczyk has now won two straight 115-pound fights and two of three overall. Waterson\u2019s loss snapped a three-fight win streak.\n\n\u201cI got a broken foot in the end of the second round, beginning of the third,\u201d Jedrzejczyk said. \u201cIt was hard, but it was an honor to headline a show here in Tampa, Fla.\u201d\n\nUp-to-the-minute UFC on ESPN+ 19 results include:", "description": "The strawweight fight was the main event of UFC on ESPN+ 19.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/joanna-jedrzejczyk-michelle-waterson-ufc-on-espn-plus-19-7.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
