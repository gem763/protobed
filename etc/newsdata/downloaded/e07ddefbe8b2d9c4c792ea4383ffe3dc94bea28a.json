As acting DNI Joseph Maguire prepares to testify about Ukraine-Gate on Capitol Hill, the whistleblower complaint that started the controversy has been declassified and released. As reported earlier, it covers more than just the July 25 phone call between Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, but that call plays a key role in the complaint. However, the \u201ccentral figure\u201d of this complaint isn\u2019t so much Trump as it is Rudy Giuliani.\n\nAnd as reported earlier, all of the complaint comes from second-hand knowledge of the call and the events that transpired afterward:\n\nThe problems with secondhand accounts show up early in the complaint. The whistleblower says that \u201cmultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call\u201d told him that Trump \u201cpressured Mr. Zelenskyy\u201d multiple times to \u201ctake actions to help the President\u2019s 2020 bid.\u201d The complainant described the events in the call a little more accurately:\n\nHad the complainant actually read the transcript or been in the room, he might have noticed that Zelensky brought up Giuliani and the Biden investigation first, although Trump was certainly happy to discuss it. The Crowdstrike reference is accurate, though, as is its likely value to Trump. However, Trump never mentions his own election bid in the transcript nor does he pressure Zelensky in any obvious way.\n\nHowever, the complaint also has something to say about the handling of the transcript. According to the complainant, the same sources told him that the White House tried to recall it and lock it down afterward, perhaps worried about how Trump had conducted the call:\n\nThis is a curious claim. He or she is not saying that the record had been changed, but reclassified illegitimately. The actual transcript shows that the document was classified SECRET/NOFORN (no foreign access), which seems reasonable for a call between two heads of government. Zelensky discussed specific issues for defense aid, which he\u2019s probably sorry to see splashed on every American media website now, and that would qualify for significant classification. SECRET/NOFORN is not a particularly high level of classification, though, and would likely not hinder Cabinet-level officers from accessing it \u2026 unless it was loaded onto the separate system, as the complaint alleges.\n\nBut was it? And does that break any laws if it was? The president has the ultimate authority for classification, after all, and foreign policy is almost entirely the purview of the executive branch. If he didn\u2019t want Cabinet members accessing that record, that was Trump\u2019s call to make \u2014 although it\u2019s certainly subject to criticism if he did.\n\nMost of the complaint, however, has to do with Rudy Giuliani and his loose-cannon actions within the foreign-policy arena. This too comes to the complainant second-hand:\n\nThese are the more serious problems arising from the complaint. Giuliani is Trump\u2019s private attorney, not a man with State Department portfolio with the attendant Senate oversight. ABC\u2019s Jon Karl pointed this out as well:\n\nInteresting, but there are some caveats to keep in mind. The remark about the meeting\u2019s purpose being about \u201ccontaining the damage to U.S. national security\u201d was the interpretation of those meetings from people other than the complainant \u2014 people who appear not to have been participants in the conversation. This is not just secondhand but thirdhand, as is much of the Giuliani material.\n\nStill, this fits with Giuliani\u2019s general public behavior over the last few years. He\u2019s been a loose cannon as an unofficial Trump spokesman too, so much so that many of Trump\u2019s supporters wonder why Trump has kept him around this long. If Giuliani has been inserting himself into Ukrainian diplomatic and security matters in the same way he has with Trump\u2019s media liaison efforts, it\u2019s small wonder why intelligence officials have become alarmed.\n\nAll in all, the complaint does seem troubling, although hardly conclusive, while being clearly handicapped by its gossipy nature. It\u2019s not a nothingburger, at least not yet. One can see why the intelligence committees would want to start talking with officials closer to these events to see whether the second- and third-hand accounts here are accurate, and if so, what they mean. As Ben Sasse said last night, everyone needs to slow down while people get to the bottom of the complaint \u2014 and determine whether how much of these claims are legitimate concerns, and how much might just be some sour grapes or disgruntlement.\n\nAddendum: I meant to ask this in the penultimate paragraph, but how much more damage is Trump willing to take by keeping Giuliani around? The Mueller probe is over, after all, which is what Giuliani was hired to manage.", "description": "Loose cannons.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/giuliani-mtp.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
