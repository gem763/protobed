We just don\u2019t know when exactly.\n\nAccording to Dutch bank ING\u2019s financial and banking experts, a \u201cfully-fledged central bank digital currency is coming.\u201d\n\nIn an article published today on THINK, the bank\u2019s economic and financial analysis platform, ING\u2019s chief economist Mark Cliffe and its lead economist for digital finance Teunis Brosens said we \u201cmight well see a central bank digital currency emerge within the next five years.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is so sure, though. In a video accompanying the article, Priscilla Toffano an economist from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes central bank digital currencies will be realized much further in the future.\n\nCliffe goes on to add that with bank-owned digital currencies we might be able to \u201cget rid of hard cash and notes\u201d altogether.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t see how that is any different to the digital representations of the cash we have at the moment, though. The major change would be if banks were running their own currencies like ING Coin, rather than a single currency like a digital dollar.\n\nThinking of it like that, it sounds terrifying. A central bank digital currency would only give further power to the issuing bank over how that currency is controlled and governed. It would further remove what anonymity we have in paying with cash.\n\nIt\u2019s starting to sound a lot like what Facebook is trying to do with its \u2018cryptocurrency\u2018 Libra. Given how that is going, banks would be doing well to issue their own digital currencies within the next five years. But when it does happen, we\u2019re all doomed, probably.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
