An Elector's Vice Versa for The Current's town hall event on democracy, and performed it in studio.\n\nCanadians go to the polls on Oct. 21.\n\nWatch George Elliott Clarke's poetry performance:\n\nGeorge Elliott Clarke, poet and author, performs a reading of his poem, 'To vote or veto? An elector's vice versa' 2:49\n\nHere is the full text of the poem:\n\nTo Vote or Veto? An Elector's Vice Versa\n\n\"Citizen I agree: Voting is pointless!\n\nIsn't every politico shameless at deceit?\n\nAssuredly, their love's never uneducated \u2014\n\nNever clean of unscrupulous motives:\n\nNote their insidious subtraction of once-eager promises.\n\nThe whole shebang be as cynical as champagne:\n\nAll that blather and fizz and froth, signifying zero!\n\nCitizen, I too dislike the schmucks, the shills,\n\nWho, gums flapping flimflam, pontificate on hot air,\n\nWhile they raunchily debauch the Treasury.\n\nAnd okay gerrymandering, money-laundering,\n\nAnd/or whitewash crooks and blacklist do-gooders.\n\nA cult of misers and prudes, killjoys and grifters,\n\nThey wreak havoc on lower-echelon, income brackets.\n\nCitizen, yes, many governors are cash-flush,\n\nBut piss-poor in ideas; or they're sell sell-outs,\n\nPinstripes for sale so impeccably despicable\u2014\n\nThese vamps and vampires feeding on poor sots' blood;\n\nThese snooty prevaricators belabour\n\nOverly elaborate, hoity-toity vocabulary,\n\nso they can scam the damned and the goddamned.\n\nCitizen, sometimes I feel downright ashamed\n\nTo pencil an \"X\" inside the ballot's circle:\n\nFor one thing, it mirrors a gun-scope's cross-hair,\n\nAs if I'm assassinating the candidate via soft lead.\n\nBut I always suspect that, no matter who I choose,\n\nI've screwed up, and may be sending a screwball\n\nOr a loose screw, or some kind of antichrist\n\nto a junkyard\u2014or graveyard\u2014parliament.\n\nCitizen, I'm sick of choosing between sleaze-bags\n\nAnd scalawags, rascals and scoundrels: Geez!\n\nMust my vote be so unmeaningful\u2014I mean, a waste?\n\nToo many lawyers\u2014as subtle as vermin\u2014wanna be my voice!\n\nYuck! Why must folks who get paid to talk\n\nEnd up doing all the talking and squawking.\n\nThey blah-blah-blah so much, my voice is silenced!\n\nCitizen, I too distrust all the campaign shouting\n\nAnd propaganda and pure b.s. and also fake news b.s.\n\nBut I also despise one tawdry, singular certainty:\n\nThe same-old mouths spewing the same-old bilge.\n\nI prefer the wild pickings an election tosses up\u2014\n\nThe fresh faces and new blood vigorous enough\n\nTo frenzy atoms and shake up nervous systems!\n\nCitizen, yes, an election changes nothing; that's true:\n\nBut to change a government changes everything.\n\nIn that case, the election's an ennobling electrocution:\n\nThe \"shocking upset\" recharges and rejigs and revives;\n\nAnd lightning scraps and enraptures all stifling gloom.\n\nAlways should we rabble be troublesome, and so never\n\nShould we veto our vote, but use always our vote as veto.\"\n\n\n\nProduced by Padraig Moran and Yamri Taddesse.", "description": "George Elliott Clarke, Canada's former parliamentary poet laureate, wrote a new poem for The Current's town hall event on democracy.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5313188.1570545361!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/george-elliott-clarke.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
