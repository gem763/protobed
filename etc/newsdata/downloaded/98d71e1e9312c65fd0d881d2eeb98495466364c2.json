Telstra said the tracking of shipments allowed the German giant to reduce the cost of missing cargo.\n\nFor the trial on the Lower Burdekin, both river quality and the quality of ground bores have been monitored.\n\n\"In a trial we prototyped new water quality sensors along a major river connected via Telstra's NB-IoT network, with data visualised, shared and permissioned across multiple government agencies and related entities through the Telstra Data Hub,\" Telstra group executive product and technology Christian von Reventlow said.\n\nTelstra also said the focus of the hub is transactional data, not personal data.\n\nMicrosoft Australia IoT and AI lead Matt Sinclair told ZDNet that the data and services will be located within Australia, allowing customers to handle data sovereignty as needed.\n\nAlthough the telco said it had paying customers, Telstra would not disclose when the hub would become generally available to businesses.\n\nThe announcement at Telstra's Vantage conference arrived a day after the telco announced it was placing its existing IT services businesses under a single banner dubbed Purple.\n\nFormer brands and companies in the market such such as VMTech, MSC, Readify, Kloud, Bridgepoint, O2, NSC, iVision, and Company85 will be retired under the consolidation, which will cover over 1,500 employees that work on more than 8,000 projects annually, the telco said.\n\nTelstra explained during its Vantage conference keynote that it came up with the name by chopping the front half of purpose with the back end of people to form Purple.\n\nDisclosure: Chris Duckett travelled to Telstra Vantage as a guest of Telstra\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "Azure used for upcoming Data Hub product targeted at water management, agribusiness, and connected supply chain.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/31/4529c708-d53d-4bcf-8771-07c9eea3e945/thumbnail/770x578/0135ed8fd7238af1906540153fd1ee5f/data.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
