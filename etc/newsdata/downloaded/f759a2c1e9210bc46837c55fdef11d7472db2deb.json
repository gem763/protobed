John Bel Edwards stumps for reelection during a campaign stop in New Orleans on July 8. (David Grunfeld/AP)\n\nAs the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, John Bel Edwards appeared to be doing everything necessary to win a second term in Louisiana, a state whose populist Democratic roots seem to fray a bit more each year.\n\nEdwards signed some of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws . He cozied up to President Trump, scoring an invite to a state dinner at the White House. And in a state with a robust Catholic population, Edwards aired television ads showing him shaking hands with Pope Francis.\n\nBut all that still might not be enough for the governor to win his reelection battle outright on Saturday, as Trump holds an 11th-hour rally to boost support for the two leading GOP challengers.\n\nTrump is wading into a so-called \u201cjungle\u201d primary where Edwards and five other candidates from both parties will be on the ballot. Edwards needs more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a Nov. 16 runoff, where he would likely face either Rep. Ralph Abraham (R) or GOP businessman Eddie Rispone.\n\nAs the first statewide contest since the impeachment inquiry against the president began, the election\u2019s outcome will indicate whether Trump has sway in other upcoming gubernatorial elections, including in next month\u2019s races in Kentucky and Mississippi. For Democrats, Saturday\u2019s contest will test whether a relatively conservative Democrat can still count on liberal urban voters and African Americans to turn out in big numbers in a state where their party continues to shrink.\n\n\u201cFor a Democrat to get 50 percent in a deep red state was always going to be a challenge,\u201d said Mary Patricia Wray, a Louisiana-based political consultant and a former Edwards aide. \u201cI know [Edwards] anticipated things becoming very tight at the end of the race, and I think that is exactly what we see happening.\u201d\n\nSeveral recent polls have shown Edwards\u2019s support in the election hovering in the mid-40 percent. Abraham and Rispone are locked in a tight battle for second place.\n\nAlthough Trump has not endorsed either Republican, the president hopes he can help force Edwards into a runoff by driving up GOP turnout. Trump won Louisiana by 20 percentage points in 2016, the best showing for a GOP presidential candidate there since Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide reelection in 1984.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always felt this race is going to go to a runoff,\u201d said Amelia Chasse Alcivar, the communications director for the Republican Governors Association, which has spent more than $4.5 million on the race. \u201cThe governor has not demonstrated any ability to get the support of the majority of Louisiana voters, and this is an electorate looking for a change.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom left, Eddie Rispone, Gov. John Bel Edwards and Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham participate in a televised gubernatorial debate on Sept. 19 in Baton Rouge (Bill Feig/AP)\n\nThere are reasons for the GOP to be optimistic. During the state\u2019s week of early voting that ended Saturday, about 375,000 people voted, ranking only behind the 2016 presidential election in early voting turnout. Republicans cast 42 percent of those ballots, even though they make up just 30 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters, said John M. Couvillon, founder of JMC Analytics and Polling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this happened in a vacuum,\u201d said Couvillon. \u201cIn my view, impeachment played a part because this is a huge difference in partisan enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats say Edwards remains well-positioned to avoid the runoff, drawing on his personal popularity as well as his record as a folksy, bipartisan leader.\n\nAfter serving in the Louisiana House of Representatives, Edwards was elected governor in 2015 with an easy defeat of Republican David Vitter, who was a U.S. Senator marred in scandal at the time. Edwards succeeded Bobby Jindal, a Republican who left office deeply unpopular amid deep budget cuts and a $2 billion budget deficit.\n\nAfter he took office, Edwards worked with a Republican legislature to balance the budget, imposing a sales tax increase. He also successfully fought to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which extended coverage to nearly a half-million residents.\n\nOne of Edwards\u2019s most high-profile accomplishments has been legislation reforming the criminal justice system in a state that had one of the nation\u2019s highest, and most racially unbalanced, incarceration rates. The legislation, which reduced sentences for some drug crimes and made it easier for some inmates to seek parole, could cut the state\u2019s prison population by 10 percent over a decade, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nState Rep. Terry Landry, a black Democrat who represents the Lafayette area, said Edwards\u2019s work on that issue has helped solidify support among African Americans, who make up about a third of the state\u2019s population. Louisiana Democrats historically need them to turn out in large numbers to win statewide.\n\n\u201cWhen you get through all the Republican rhetoric, they still have not found a message about why we should not reelect this guy,\u201d said Landry, who believes Trump\u2019s Friday visit will energize black voters.\n\nBut Edwards, a devout Catholic, has angered some Democrats over his repeated support for antiabortion measures, including a \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d he signed this summer that outlawed abortion as early as the sixth week of a pregnancy. The bill did not make exceptions for rape or incest.\n\n\u201cThis was an opportunity for the governor to show real empathy and compassion for his constituents, many of whom were low-income women, and he signed it anyway,\u201d said Amy Irvin, executive director of the New Orleans Abortion Fund, an abortion rights advocacy group.\n\nIrvin now fears Edwards actions could accelerate the abortion case landing before the Supreme Court, threatening Roe v. Wade. But she still expects liberal women will turn out and vote for Edwards on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe people I talk to continue to be upset with the governor, and indicated they are not volunteering or making donations to his campaign, but also feel they don\u2019t have any other choice but to vote for him,\u201d said Irvin, noting the expansion of Medicaid and Edwards\u2019s support for equal pay and an increase in the minimum wage also \u201cmake a real difference in women\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\n\n\nVice President Pence takes pictures with supporters during the Louisiana GOP Unity Rally in Kenner, La., on Oct. 5.

(Sophia Germer/AP)\n\nBut in the final days of the campaign, Republican groups have been trying to undercut Edwards\u2019s support among women by accusing him of overlooking a former aide\u2019s alleged sexual harassment.\n\nIn separate television ads released last week, the Republican Governors Association and the Truth in Politics PAC hammered Edwards for his decision to hire Johnny Anderson as his deputy chief of staff, a veteran state official and Democratic operative who faced claims of sexual harassment in the 2000s. A new allegation surfaced in 2017 when he worked for Edwards, and the woman who made that allegation was featured in the Truth and Politics ad.\n\n\u201cSix women reported Johnny Anderson for harassment. The governor hired him anyway,\u201d Juanita Washington, a former state employee, says in the emotional ad. \u201cI was his latest victim.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Edwards noted that Anderson abruptly left state government after Washington\u2019s allegations surfaced.\n\n\u201cGov. Edwards believes Ms. Washington\u2019s allegations, and he has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment,\u201d said Eric Holl, a spokesman for the Edwards campaign.\n\nStill, some party leaders concede they face a potentially insurmountable challenge as white, rural southern voters continue to flee the Democratic Party.\n\nThe Advocate newspaper noted, as of June, Louisiana had 6 percent fewer registered Democrats than it did when Edwards took office in January 2016. The number of registered Republicans has increased by about 10 percent during the same period.\n\nMeanwhile, as Edwards\u2019s Republican challengers fight to make the runoff, both Abraham and Rispone are campaigning as strong Trump allies.\n\nRispone, who argues he\u2019s the \u201coutsider\u201d candidate, has aired a television ad calling Trump\u2019s policies \u201cphenomenal.\u201d Abraham, whom many state party leaders support, has argued that the House should expel House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over her support for the impeachment inquiry.\n\nYet, some Louisiana Republicans doubt the impeachment drama in Washington will factor heavily in the outcome.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it makes a difference,\u201d said Roby Dyer, chairwoman of the Calcasieu Parish Republican Executive Committee. \u201cMost people were going to vote anyway, and I don\u2019t think most of them aren\u2019t even listening to that nonsense.\u201d\n\nBut Wray says Trump\u2019s visit only adds to the last-minute uncertainty of the campaign.\n\nIn 2015, Edwards won 29 counties that Trump also carried a year later. Most of the counties are rural, and Wray noted that Trump\u2019s visit coincides with Friday night football.\n\n\u201cThey will be tuning into the local radio and local television for their third religion \u2014 after real religion and Mardi Gras,\u201d said Wray, referring to football highlights and scores. \u201cSo, they will tune in, and also definitely hear Trump\u2019s message.\u201d", "description": "Saturday\u2019s election might force Gov.
