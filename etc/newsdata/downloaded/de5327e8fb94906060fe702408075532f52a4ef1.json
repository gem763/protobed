And that in turn adds to the flywheel.'\n\nThe Envato co-founder wants to see more women having a crack in the business world\n\nCollis and Cyan Ta'eed (pictured) celebrated their 14th anniversary last week\n\nEnvato was recently listed in the top 10 Best Places to Work of Australian workplaces with 100-999 employees.\n\nIt\u2019s the sixth consecutive year it has been recognised in the Great Place to Work awards.\n\n'At Envato, we\u2019ve worked hard to cultivate 100 per cent flexible work. For the members of our team who have ongoing mental health differences that make it hard to get to work sometimes, being able to work from home whenever they feel they need to makes a meaningful difference,' Ms Ta'eed recently told Smart Company.\n\nShe also opened up about her battle with post-natal depression following the birth of her first son.\n\n'It wasn\u2019t until people asked me if I was okay that I realised I wasn\u2019t \u2014 that I recognised what I was feeling was depression, Ms Ta'eed said.\n\n'As a leader, as I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019ve realised how important self-care and being kind to yourself really is.\n\nCyan is also the founder of Hey Tiger chocolate, which supports communities in Ghana\n\nMs Ta'eed and her husband celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary last week.\n\nThe pair started up Envato around the same time.\n\n'Starting in my parents garage in 2006, we now have a team of over 600 incredible people worldwide. I'm so proud of this company and grateful to everyone that has built it up to what it is today.,' Ms Ta'eed recently posted on Instagram.\n\nThe entrepreneurial couple made headlines earlier this year when it was revealed they generously offered a $13 million profit share to 1000 current and former staff.\n\nThis is despite Envato profits almost halved in 2017-18.\n\n'That was a fun email to send. I had former colleagues ringing to check it wasn't a phishing scam,' Mr Ta'eed told AFR In April.", "description": "An entrepreneur who turned her online graphics start-up into a booming empire wants to see more businesswomen in the spotlight after making Australian Financial Review's Young Rich List.", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/23/20059406-0-image-a-16_1571784206749.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
