Since the jade roller came crashing into the Western consciousness in 2016, not long after it was declared an integral step in Alicia Keys\u2019s no-makeup beauty routine, they have become prolific, thanks in part to their adoption by social media influencers and celebrities like Tracee Ellis Ross and Meghan Markle. Courteney Cox, for one, broke her face roller out at the bar at New York\u2019s Cipriani this summer. Now they are mutating. Their materials span the periodic table, with shapes resembling medieval weaponry \u2026 and Mariah Carey\u2019s butterfly tattoo. The traditional Eastern stone devices have been infused with American \u201cadvancements\u201d like pulsing electricity and LED lights.\n\nThe popularity of these products is understandable. Jade rollers, gua shas, microneedlers, and other face rollers tout the ability to induce radiance, reverse aging, lift eyebrows, drain the lymphs, replace Botox, and fight hyperpigmentation. \u201cThe goal with any of these tools is to stimulate the skin or its underlying structures,\u201d says Upper East Side dermatologist Dendy Engelman. \u201cAnd if you do that, it will help with skin quality, blood flow, fine lines, wrinkles, textures, and tone.\u201d\n\nThese benefits only surface if you actually use the tools frequently and correctly, she says. And, when looking for guidance, nearly every aesthetician and dermatologist I spoke to cautioned against trusting Instagram influencer how-tos. Instead, Engelman suggests looking to the company who created your tool for video tutorials. \u201cBut if it\u2019s something that you\u2019ve bought on Amazon or have acquired and didn\u2019t come with instructions, go online and find skin-care experts.\u201d Tutorials produced by top-of-the-line tool brands and the world\u2019s best facialists are safe and straightforward resources. Adds Engelman, \u201cThe concept for each of these tool categories is going to be the same no matter which brand you\u2019ve purchased.\u201d\n\nDavid Colbert of New York Dermatology Group agrees: \u201cThey all do something. The real question is what and how much?\u201d I set out to find out. After testing a dozen devices over the course of a month, I noticed my skin take on a glowier, healthier, more even skin tone, and my bone structure become slightly more pronounced. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what was working and how:\n\nThe Jade Roller That Took My Sheet Masks to the Next Level\n\nHerbivore Botanicals Rose Quartz Facial Roller This simple and ancient Chinese tool shaped like a stone rolling pin is the gateway device. When employed with expert precision and regularity, this single roller could be used to drain the lymph system and help define your bone structure. Gentle massage of any kind will boost circulation and help oxygenate the skin for a near instant complexion boost that gets better over time. But beware of the influencer tutorial. For the most effective technique, turn to the makers of the best tools for videos. If used incorrectly, jade rollers can smoosh plump, healthy cheeks, warns superstar facialist Joanna Czech. Special precautions should be taken for people with fillers, says New York\u2013based dermatologist Whitney Bowe. Using any face-massaging device for deep lymphatic facial massage can not only disrupt the placement of the filler, but cause the fillers to clog your lymphatic system. \u201cIf you have fillers or get fillers done, [face rollers] can cause major complications.\u201d I might remain the last living beauty editor (if not woman in her 30s) who is filler-free, so I roll with abandon. Using the Herbivore Botanicals\u2019 online video tutorial as my guide, I find that Herbivore\u2019s Jade Roller is a choice tool for not only helping to spread expensive serums (I\u2019m looking at you, Vintner\u2019s Daughter) without letting a single drop get wastefully absorbed by my palms, but also leveling up the luxury of the moisturizing experience. Czech prefers jade rollers to be relegated to use with sheet masks for \u201cworking the product into the skin,\u201d moving the stone in short hashtag movements all over the mask. Though jade rollers vary greatly in price with very little change in form, they are not all created equal. I suggest avoiding anything too cheap, which is often a marker of a common design flaw: weak metal arms that allow the stone to fall off the tool with the slightest pressure. The Herbivore roller\u2019s arms have been reinforced to tackle this very issue. $40 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nThe Double-headed Roller That Carved My Cheekbones\n\nJoanna Czech Facial Massager Joanna Czech\u2019s own double-headed roller looks like gym equipment because it more or less is. Weighing in at a whopping 12 ounces, this barbell-esque device is designed to grip the muscles without even having to apply pressure. Engelman notes that a dual-headed roller is capable of working more of the skin at once. When employed correctly this face massager can lift the eyebrows, carve cheekbones, and remodel the face for a gentler aging process. Naturally, Czech supplies ample tutorials across her website and Instagram feed for massaging and carving out your features. With the rollers placed above the handle, pushing the tool upward and outward on your face works as a de-puffer, moving excess liquid out of the face \u2014 an ideal morning companion if you happen to suffer from allergies to plants, animals, and air like I do. A quick roll around my face (especially drawing up on my forehead and going a few inches into the hairline) leaves me looking all-together alive again, clearing the appearance of swollen jowls and under-eye bags to reveal what lies beneath: cheekbones. When you shift the direction of the handle above the rollers to pull the tool up your neck and face, it works as a massager, helping to reshape the face over time. $189 at Violet Grey Buy $189 at Orchard Mile Buy\n\nThe Microneedler Erasing My Sun Damage\n\n\n\n\n\nEnviron Gold Roll-CIT Of all of the beauty transgressions I have made in my life, sun exposure is by far the worst \u2014 a bad habit I\u2019m beginning to wear in the form of pale sun spots and ripe new baby wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes. For this, Colbert recommends in-office laser treatments and regular use of Retin-A, but he admits that with the right concentration of needle heads with ideal depth of penetration, an at-home microneedling device can be effective for smoothing the skin\u2019s surface and evening skin tone. Environ\u2019s Gold Roll CIT is one such device, outfitted with 260 microfine needles made out of surgical-grade stainless steel and coated in anti-bacterial 14ct gold. Using the pressure created by the tool itself, rolling it over my face in sections, going horizontally, then vertically, then diagonally (drawing an X over each spot) feels only vaguely aggravating, as the needles cause microtraumas that Colbert tells me \u201crecruit growth factors and the formation of collagen.\u201d But human to human, do not follow the usage of a microneedler with Biologique Recherche P50. My skin was Home Alone\u2013level screaming. This is because not all skin care was meant to reach the depths that are achieved in conjunction with a microneedler. \u201cMost patients can\u2019t tolerate using a Retin-A or an alpha hydroxy acid after microneedling,\u201d says Bowe. Microneedling should only be used on near surgically clean skin to avoid creating or spreading serious skin infections (I double cleanse my skin before use and spray my roller with rubbing alcohol before and after use), and followed by gentle, clean skin care. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to use anything with harsh preservatives,\u201d she says. Same goes for fragrances, sulfates, phthalates, and parabens, which can cause irritation. \u201cTry to use ingredients like hyaluronic acid, growth factors, and peptides that are less likely to create irritation if they\u2019re absorbed more readily into the skin.\u201d Both Czech and Colbert warn against microneedling at all if you have acne, rosacea, or broken capillaries \u2014 and overuse in general. Bowe recommends twice weekly treatments, but San Franciscan skin-care guru Kristina Holey is much more conservative, topping out at three times per year and only for in-office treatments. \u201cI have worked with a lot of clients who have come in with severe dermatitis from at-home needling devices. I would never recommend using them. In office, I would always start at a very moderate level and you can probably see some results.\u201d At home or in office, too much too quickly can disrupt the water barrier of the skin, causing dryness and hyperpigmentation \u2014 the opposite of what you\u2019re after. $300 at Rescue Spa Buy\n\nThe Overachieving Face Roller That Does It All\n\nBeautyBio GloPRO Microneedling Tool In this age of multitasking, where your phone is a camera, wallet, and a flotation device, why ever do just one thing when you can do it all at once? When it\u2019s time to quiet my deep-seated American need for achievement, I reach for the GloPro Microneedling Regeneration Tool. This microneedling device (used just like a regular microneedler in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal strokes section by section over the face) not only boasts 540 diminutive stainless-steel needles, it also vibrates while glowing fiery red with collagen-stimulating LED lights, restoring volume to uneven texture and increasing the absorption of my skin-care products by (according to BeautyBio\u2019s claims) 200 times. The red spectrum LED light is \u201ccomplementary, but an independent variable,\u201d says Colbert, which means that this tool is not more effective than using a vibrating face massager, microneedler, and LED mask separately, but it tackles all of these tasks and their benefits at once. \u201cThat is really important in American culture,\u201d says Engelman, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t have that much free time.\u201d If you could work out and sleep at the same time, wouldn\u2019t you? I\u2019m drinking that glowing red Kool-Aid. $199 at Amazon Buy $199 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Basic Stone Scraper That Is Anything But\n\n\n\n\n\nShiffa FaSha Crystal Clear Quartz Tool I\u2019ve long ignored the gua sha because it seems both overly simple in design and overly complicated to use. But simplicity can be deceiving. Though the gua sha is Chinese in origin, I\u2019ve come to think of it as the Swedish deep tissue of face massagers. This scraping device was created to work the fascia, lifting muscles, opening blockages, and stimulating lymphatic drainage. When moved upward and out over my well-oiled face, neck, and d\u00e9colletage, it worked through and released serious muscle tension in my neck and face \u2014 better than any other tool, helping to enhance circulation for brighter, better-looking skin overall. Holey has sworn by gua sha for years \u2014 not as a treatment to give, but to receive herself. \u201cYou can be more specific with the gua sha stone \u2014 you can work into the muscles in a different way,\u201d says Holey. And she\u2019s found that \u201cyou can have more visual results.\u201d Holey recommends Studio Britta\u2019s Britta Plug as a guide for usage. \u201cI send my clients there.\u201d Plug\u2019s Instagram page is filled with mini and at-length tutorials for every area of the face, skin grievance, and time allowance. With Plug\u2019s lead, I reach for my tool of choice: Shiffa\u2019s FaSha Crystal Clear Quartz Tool featuring one rounded edge for large muscle groups, one inverted curve for cheekbone shaping, a small crease for carving out the jawline, and a serrated edge for extra deep massage \u2014 and it has become the surprise favorite in my skin-care lineup. $40 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy $40 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nThe Vibrating Massager That Chilled Me Out Like CBD\n\nGold Sculpting Bar by Jillian Dempsey Like a strong dose of CBD, this 24-karat gold, vibrating, T-shaped bar dreamed up by organic-makeup guru Jillian Dempsey releases tension in your face, and is designed to leave your skin lifted, toned, contoured, and revived. Because I\u2019ve only used the tool for such a short period of time, I can really only speak to the brightening effects of that instant blood rush to the skin. So, too, this little wonder not only helped me realize that I clench my teeth while I sleep, it offered a solution: instant release of jaw tension. I rev this puppy up as soon as I\u2019ve applied my skin care, morning and night, to just get those good vibrations all over my face, starting at my neck, moving upward and outward all the way up into my hairline to release tension and boost my circulation and lymphatic system. Holding it on the inner corners of my eyebrows makes for an incredible release for sinus tension. If the directions didn\u2019t explicitly tell me to not use it over makeup, I would be pulling it out at Cipriani, too. In fact, for its ease of use and ability to deliver instant relaxation, I couldn\u2019t care less if it provided actual skin-care benefits, but it apparently does. According to Bowe, applying vibrational energy on the skin with slight pressure \u201ccan theoretically stimulate collagen production and act as a wakeup call for your cells.\u201d In other words, you\u2019ll not only feel like a California wellness guru, you\u2019ll look like one too. This is the tool I take with me on trips and now use daily. Whether or not it\u2019s the most effective design is beside the point because, according to Engelman, \u201cthe best tool is the one you use.\u201d $195 at Jillian Dempsey Buy $195 at Goop Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
