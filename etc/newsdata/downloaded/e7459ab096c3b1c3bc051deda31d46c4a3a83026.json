It was recovered from a container on board the MV Gibraltar after it docked at Felixstowe on 30 August. The drugs were stored in packets labelled as protein powder, which were inside boxes filled with towels and dressing gowns.\n\nAfter the drugs were removed, officers returned the container to the ship, which continued to Antwerp and docked in the Belgian port city on 1 September, and was driven by lorry to a warehouse in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. As it was unloaded Dutch and Belgian officers police swooped and arrested four people.\n\nJenny Sharp, Border Force assistant director at Felixstowe, said some of the 1kg blocks of heroin had been stitched inside towels and it took officers nearly six hours to remove them.\n\nWith the Press Association", "description": "\u00a3120m haul was removed by police at Felixstowe before container continued on to Netherlands, where four people were arrested", "authors": ["Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/182d90a7bd71889d55cde4650d7d1cc8f6ac4a24/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd56ff8ab245a0a31eae9108ad958fd4"}
