Now, a decade later, she has emerged to tell her story about the time she says he sexually assaulted her.\n\nIn the video below, from the first episode of the show\u2019s fifth season, Zervos speaks up to defend her fellow contestant, who Trump and his co-hosts have been ridiculing for giving away gift bags with nothing in them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, let me just say something really quick,\u201d she says, daring to assert herself in front of The Donald.\n\n\u201cWhy is should you interrupt me when I\u2019m knocking the hell out him?\u201d Trump asks her. As she tries to explain, he talks over her. \u201cBy interrupting me while I\u2019m knocking him, what are you doing to yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow stupid is that?\u201d Trump continues. \u201cI\u2019m getting ready to almost fire this guy for being a horrible leader\u2026 and you keep interrupting me and stopping me from doing it.\u201d With that, Trump delivers his iconic \u201cYou\u2019re fired\u201d line to Zervos.\n\nThe offense Trump takes at being interrupted by a woman had echoes in the second presidential debate this past week when he repeatedly complained that moderator Martha Raddatz was cutting him off mid-sentence. This is despite the fact that by some counts he interrupted Hillary Clinton more than 50 times during the first debate, about three times as much she she interrupted him.\n\nAs Zervos walks out of the room, Trump tells the man he was about to fire, \u201cShe saved your ass, with her own stupidity.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, according to Zervos, she visited Trump to discuss a job opportunity at one of his golf courses in California. While there, she alleges Trump repeatedly kissed her on the lips, grabbed her breasts and started \u201cthrusting his genitals\u201d at her, all without her consent.", "description": "The \u2018Apprentice\u2019 host called his future sexual-harassment accuser Summer Zervos \u201cstupid\u201d for interrupting him when he was about to fire someone else.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492108549/articles/2016/10/14/watch-donald-trump-fired-his-apprentice-accuser-summer-zervos-for-interrupting-him/161014-wilstein-trump-apprentice-video-tease_nab7gm", "published_at": "2016-10-14"}
