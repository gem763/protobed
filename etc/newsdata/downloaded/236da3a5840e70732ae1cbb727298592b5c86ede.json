Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait swiftly condemned Turkey\u2019s actions as a violation of Syria\u2019s sovereignty, while Qatar stood alone within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as a defender of Turkey\u2019s military intervention.\n\nAlthough Turkey paused Operation Peace Spring after a US-brokered five-day cease-fire was reached Oct. 17, Ankara\u2019s actions could profoundly impact how the Gulf countries approach the war in Syria and perceive their alliance with the United States, and further complicate prospects for Gulf reconciliation. While the Saudi and Emirati reactions to Turkey\u2019s Operation Olive Branch offensive against Afrin in January 2018 featured ambiguous calls for the creation of an Arab collective security structure and public defenses of the predominantly Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), both countries expressed solidarity with the Syrian state in the aftermath of Operation Peace Spring.\n\nThe UAE, which reestablished relations with Damascus in December 2018, described Syria as a \u201cbrotherly Arab country,\u201d while Saudi Arabia more cautiously emphasized the importance of preserving Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Saudi Arabia and the UAE also refrained from providing material support to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) or the YPG, even though both countries had allegedly provided military assistance to Kurdish forces in Syria in the past. As Saudi Arabia opposes Turkey\u2019s safe-zone proposal and is unwilling to instigate a proxy war with Turkey by supporting Kurdish forces, Riyadh might view a rapprochement with the SDF\u2019s new partner, the Syrian government, as the best way to protect its interests.\n\nWhen asked whether Operation Peace Spring and the resulting alignment between President Bashar al-Assad and the SDF would make Saudi Arabia more inclined to normalize relations with Syria, former US Ambassador to Yemen Gerald Feierstein told Al-Monitor that Saudi Arabia \u201ccould accept, if not necessarily embrace\u201d Assad as Syria\u2019s legitimate leader. To justify this argument, Feierstein contended that Saudi Arabia\u2019s desire to accommodate Russia, loss of confidence in US leadership and willingness to align its position with its leading regional partners could eventually cause Riyadh to normalize its diplomatic relationship with Damascus. Although a complete rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Syria could take some time to unfold, Operation Peace Spring could help remove one of the last remaining obstacles to Syria\u2019s return to the Arab League.\n\nAlso read\n\nIn terms of the broader geopolitical implications of Operation Peace Spring, US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to greenlight Turkey\u2019s offensive has caused prominent figures in the Gulf to openly question Washington\u2019s reliability as an ally. Commentators in the UAE have been especially willing to publicly criticize US conduct. On Oct. 13, Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent Dubai-based political scientist, wrote, \u201cToday, America turned its back on the Kurds and left them prey to [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan; who will she turn her back on tomorrow?\u201d Ebtesam al-Ketbi, the president of the Emirates Policy Center in Abu Dhabi, concurred by saying Washington\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from Syria showed that \u201cAmerica is no longer a reliable ally.\u201d When asked to elaborate on this statement, Ketbi told Al-Monitor that \u201cany vacuum caused by the US retreating from the region will create an opportunity for Russia and China,\u201d and American allies such as the UAE \u201cwill try and diversify their allies and partnerships\u201d even though the United States is still their main partner.\n\nSaudi commentators were generally more cautious than their Emirati counterparts about criticizing US policy in Syria, but Saudi media outlets featured discussions of Washington\u2019s intentional surrender of its influence in the Middle East and the need for Riyadh to expand its outreach to non-Western partners. Trump\u2019s impulsive decision to abandon the Kurds caused particular disquiet in Riyadh. Salman al-Dossary, the former editor-in-chief of the Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat, emphasized that Trump acted out of step with the views of Congress and the Pentagon, and expressed confidence that US institutions would ultimately steer Washington\u2019s policy in a pro-Kurdish and anti-Erdogan direction. The Trump administration\u2019s approval of a cease-fire involving Turkey that accommodated most of Ankara\u2019s objectives could challenge Riyadh\u2019s confidence in the stabilizing role of US institutions and has distracted from the US decision to deploy 3,000 additional troops to the Gulf region.\n\nAlthough Operation Peace Spring created a spirit of unity between Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait that has been sorely lacking in recent months, Qatar\u2019s unwillingness to join the GCC consensus on Turkey\u2019s actions further complicates prospects for Gulf reconciliation. To Saudi Arabia and the UAE\u2019s chagrin, Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani discussed his country\u2019s \u201cstrategic relations\u201d with Turkey on the day Operation Peace Spring began. Qatar also publicly endorsed Turkey\u2019s national security justification for intervention, and expressed reservations about the Oct. 12 Arab League statement that condemned Turkey\u2019s \u201cinvasion\u201d of Syria.\n\nGerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations at Georgetown University in Qatar, told Al-Monitor that perceptions of the GCC\u2019s growing irrelevance outside of day-to-day technical aspects and Qatar\u2019s \u201cstrategic dependence\u201d on Ankara due to the ongoing blockade gave Doha \u201clittle option but to align with Turkey.\u201d Nonneman said Qatar-Turkey relations might not strengthen due to Operation Peace Spring, as Qatari policymakers were uncomfortable with the SDF\u2019s anti-Islamic State and \"anti-Assad work being chucked out the window,\u201d and Qatar actively sought out options for deescalation throughout the crisis. Even if Qatar-Turkey relations do not visibly improve, Doha\u2019s reaction to Operation Peace Spring will likely prevent a revival of speculation about a partial Saudi Arabia-Qatar rapprochement that surfaced throughout the summer.\n\nAlthough the Gulf countries were not direct protagonists in Turkey\u2019s offensive in northern Syria, Operation Peace Spring could increase the prospects of a Saudi Arabia-Syria rapprochement, encourage Saudi Arabia and the UAE to expedite their foreign policy diversification strategies, and sharpen Qatar\u2019s isolation from the GCC. As the prospects for durable peace in northern Syria remain tenuous, the Gulf countries will watch Turkey\u2019s actions in this region with unease for the foreseeable future.", "description": "Turkey's Operation Peace Spring has exacerbated the divide between Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait on the one hand and Qatar on the other.", "authors": ["Samuel Ramani"], "top_image": "https://9c998969b63acdb676d1-37595348221e1b716e1a6cfee3ed7891.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/almpics/2019/10/RTS2S6KZ.jpg/RTS2S6KZ-870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
