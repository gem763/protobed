That could further balloon the U.S. deficit -- already on track for $1 trillion -- and weaken the dollar, he said.\n\n\u201cWarren and Trump\u2019s tone would be different but the end result would be the same, massive blowouts of the U.S. government budget,\u201d Bechtel wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cIf the market starts seeing the fiscal side under stress as a result of what the new president or continued President would do, then the USD could start to soften up, short term.\u201d\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has increased in five of the past six years, and it\u2019s up again in 2019 as the greenback beats all but two Group-of-10 currencies. Trump would probably welcome a weaker dollar. He has frequently complained that the currency\u2019s strength is making it more difficult for U.S. manufacturers to compete abroad.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that he\u2019s planning another tax cut, following last year\u2019s package. Meanwhile, Warren has proposed funneling $3 trillion toward fighting climate change.\n\nWhile budget pressures would initially pressure the dollar, this will eventually support the currency, Bechtel said. \u201cRates would move higher and that would ultimately support the USD but in the short term you could see an extended period of USD weakness.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Katherine Greifeld in New York at kgreifeld@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Nick Baker, Mark Tannenbaum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A 2020 U.S. presidential election that pits Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren against President Donald Trump could finally crack the dollar\u2019s multiyear rise, according to Jefferies LLC.Analysts are evaluating the scenario after a poll released Saturday showed Warren took the lead in", "authors": ["Katherine Greifeld"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jPk6K0xbxk575JIkgxOjzA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/01e9eac3dae3179ae3a91c357e4c5fe9", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
