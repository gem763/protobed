(Tom Brenner/The New York Times)\n\nDuring a contentious Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017, Rudy Giuliani pressed for help in securing the release of a jailed client, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader, as part of a potential prisoner swap with Turkey.\n\nThe request by Giuliani provoked an immediate objection from Tillerson, who argued that it would be highly inappropriate to interfere in an open criminal case, according to two people briefed on the meeting.\n\nThe gold trader, Reza Zarrab, had been accused by federal prosecutors of playing a central role in an effort by a state-owned Turkish bank to funnel more than $10 billion worth of gold and cash to Iran, in defiance of U.S. sanctions designed to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nBut at the White House meeting in early 2017, Giuliani and his longtime friend and colleague, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, pushed back on Tillerson\u2019s objections.\n\nRather than side with his secretary of state, Trump told them to work it out themselves, according to the two people briefed on the meeting. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.\n\nIn the end, no such prisoner swap took place. But the episode has opened a new chapter in Giuliani\u2019s efforts to interject himself into the Trump administration\u2019s diplomacy while at times representing clients with a direct interest in the outcome.\n\nThe Oval Office meeting occurred before Giuliani became Trump\u2019s personal lawyer for the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation. In recent weeks, Giuliani\u2019s campaign to press Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of one of Trump\u2019s political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, has thrust him into the middle of the House impeachment inquiry. And on Wednesday, two of Giuliani\u2019s associates in that campaign were arrested on charges of violating federal campaign finance laws.\n\nGiuliani, in an interview Thursday, defended his actions in the gold trader case, which were first reported Wednesday by Bloomberg.\n\nGiuliani, well known for his hawkish views on Iran, said he had been willing to represent Zarrab because the proposed prisoner swap would have secured the release of an American pastor who was being held in Turkey on terrorism-related charges the United States considered fabricated.\n\nHe likened his efforts \u2014 which also included apprising Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, of what he wanted \u2014 to maneuvers during the Cold War to trade enemy spies for Americans detained overseas.\n\nGiuliani questioned how his actions were any different. \u201cIt happened to be a good trade,\u201d he said. \u201cI expected to be a hero like in a Tom Hanks movie.\u201d\n\nBut his involvement, as a private citizen and friend of the president in the months after Trump passed him over for the role of secretary of state, left some in the administration uncomfortable, given the strained and complicated relationship between the United States and Turkey.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s moves also ran counter to a long-running effort to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program as the United States was trying to punish players, like Zarrab, who helped the regime evade sanctions.\n\nThe Zarrab case, called the single largest evasion of Iranian sanctions in U.S. history, revolved around a scheme by the Turkish bank in 2012 and 2013 to send billions of dollars in gold and cash to Iran in exchange for oil and natural gas.\n\nZarrab, who has Turkish and Iranian citizenship, was arrested in Florida in March 2016 on a family trip to Disney World, and was accused of an illicit operation that relied on false documents and front companies to move the assets to Iran from the accounts of Halkbank, the second-largest state-owned lender in Turkey.\n\nGetting him out of the United States was a high priority for Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, because Zarrab had information that would later implicate senior bank officials, as well as Turkish government officials, in the scheme.\n\nIndeed, after the prison swap failed, Zarrab became a key witness and testified that in 2012, Erdogan, then Turkey\u2019s prime minister, had ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in the sanction-evasion scheme.\n\nGiuliani said that he was brought into the effort by Mukasey, who had been hired by Zarrab\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman.", "description": "During a contentious Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017, Rudy Giuliani pressed for help in securing the release of a jailed client, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader, as part of a potential prisoner swap with Turkey.The request by Giuliani provoked", "authors": ["Jo Becker", "Maggie Haberman", "Eric Lipton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hbqY31M7hjvSdeRduqRBIA--~B/aD0yODA1O3c9NDIwNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/fc24af7207d921abff173be885946d24", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
