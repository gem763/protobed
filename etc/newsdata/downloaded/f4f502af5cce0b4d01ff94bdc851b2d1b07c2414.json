[JOONGANG ILBO]\n\nBUSAN - Don Gibson\u2019s 1961 classic folk song \u201cSea of Heartbreak\u201d is about a man\u2019s heartbreak after his lover leaves him and all he can do is wait by the sea. But at the Sea Art Festival 2019, \u201cSea of Heartbreak\u201d is about more the just personal sorrow.This year\u2019s Sea Art Festival kicked off on Sept. 28 at Dadaepo Beach in western Busan and will run until Oct. 27. The event features 21 works by 20 teams of artists. The heartbreaks that ail contemporary humanity - the environment, refugees and class division - may not be the first things that comes to your mind when you hear the title of the festival, but the theme gives visitors the opportunity to visualize such problems.\u201cWhen people think of the sea, they usually think of happy images - joy, hope and summer,\u201d said the festival\u2019s director Seo Sang-ho. \u201cSo I worried about associating the word \u2018heartbreak\u2019 with the sea. But it began from the question, how does public art work? And what can a museum do for people in a public space? So that\u2019s how I came up with an art festival that lets people experience the same thing and take home questions about the environment.\u201dThe Sea Art Festival is held every other year by the Busan Biennale Organizing Committee, when the Busan Biennale isn\u2019t held. This year\u2019s director, Seo, was appointed in February. He currently runs Openspace Bae, a nonprofit based in Busan to support up-and-coming artists.The Sea Art Festival began in 1987 as a part of the pre-Olympic celebration by the city before the 1988 Seoul Olympics and has been organized by the Busan Biennale Organizing Committee since 2011. The festival saw around 380,000 visitors last year during its 30-day run at Dadaepo Beach.This year, various artists have used the sea to discuss the things they believe have hurt humanity. \u201cMoving Sculpture Garden,\u201d which is placed at the entrance of the park and was made by the artist team The Wild Rabbit Plays the Tambourine in the Art Center, offers a look at how people hide their inner thoughts and cannot fulfill their true desires.Works by Manish Lal Shrestha, Hsiao-chi Tsai & Kimiya Yoshikawa and James Tapscott lead visitors to the sandy beach, where the rest of the works are on display.The human-like sand sculptures by Lee Seung-soo, titled \u201cWhere Should We Go,\u201d illustrate how humanity is hurting itself with the waste that is left behind in nature. Visitors can then stand inside \u201cIf There is an Island on the Beach\u201d by Taitung Dawn Artist Village & Toko Studio to feel the coziness of civilization.At \u201cTales from the Wind: Litanies of the Sea\u201d by Alfredo Aquilizan and Isabel Aquilizan, visitors are warned to be careful to not become submerged in the eerie mood created by the bamboo forest.\u201cWe must not only view the sea as a happy place,\u201d Seo said. \u201cWe have to think about the things that we don\u2019t see by looking at the sea. We don\u2019t see the effects of our actions right now, but in the future, we will. And it\u2019s supposed to be depressing, because that\u2019s the role of art - to make us think about the things we don\u2019t get to in our daily lives.\u201dBY YOON SO-YEON [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/08194345.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
