The selection revived accusations about Trump's ability to use his office for financial gain and claims that he's violated the Constitution by collecting payments from foreign governments going to businesses he owns.\n\nSince the early days of his presidency, Trump has faced multiple ongoing lawsuits alleging he is violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits a sitting president from accepting payments from foreign governments.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, one of the groups suing Trump over the emoluments issue, said Trump's Saturday announcement was \"a bow to reality, but does not change how astonishing it was that a president ever thought this was appropriate, or that it was something he could get away with.\"\n\nDemocratic House leaders had planned a vote as early as this week to rebuke Trump over the decision. They also planned investigations into the selection process and suggested they would prevent government money from being spent at Trump properties. A number of Republicans in Congress had also voiced concerns with the Doral choice.\n\nAn hour before Trump canceled the Doral plan, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden issued a rebuke on Twitter.\n\n\"Hosting the G7 at Trump's hotel? A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain,\" the former vice president wrote.\n\nDuring Thursday's press briefing, Mulvaney dismissed the possibility of returning to Camp David to hold the gathering, describing it as \"too small\" and \"too remote.\"\n\n\"I understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G-7,\" he said.\n\nNPR's Brett Neely contributed to this report.", "description": "Blaming \"Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility\" as the reason for his reversal, the president said he will consider other sites for next year's meeting of international leaders.", "authors": ["Emma Bowman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/20/ap_19238757585355_wide-17203db05b7d20aed1d9e192eef404099dc5cdad.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
