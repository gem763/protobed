USA TODAY\n\nThe 115th World Series gets underway Tuesday at Minute Maid Park, with the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals vying for the Commissioner's Trophy in this best-of-seven series.\n\nHouston won 107 games in the regular season and were the big favorites heading into the playoffs, but it's been far from easy in October. The Astros were forced to a winner-take-all Game 5 against the Rays in the ALDS and just edged out the Yankees in six games in the ALCS.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington has fought its way to the Fall Classic for the first time in franchise history. The Nationals rallied to beat the Brewers in the wild-card game, did the same against the Dodgers in the NLDS and then swept the Cardinals in the NLCS.\n\nOLD-SCHOOL WORLD SERIES: With aces lined up, Astros and Nationals ready: 'We need that in 2019'\n\nIT'S A CONCERN: World Series history not on Nationals' side after lengthy layoff\n\nHere's how the USA TODAY Sports baseball staff sees the Fall Classic playing out:\n\nBob Nightengale \u2013 @Bnightengale\n\nAstros in 7\n\nI\u2019m veering off my spring-training prediction of Nationals winning the World Series over the Astros. The Nationals' starting quartet has been phenomenal, but the Astros simply are a more complete team. They haven\u2019t even hit in the first two rounds, and still made it to the World Series. It\u2019s impossible to believe it will last. There\u2019s also the matter of the lengthy layoff. It crushes teams. And it could be the deciding blow to the Nats\u2019 lineup. Washington has to win at least one of the first two games in Houston to make this intriguing.\n\nGabe Lacques \u2013 @GabeLacques\n\nAstros in 5\n\nMake no mistake: The Nationals can certainly win this. Manager Dave Martinez indicated an aggressive stance regarding use of his starters out of the bullpen, to go for the kill early and also put the keep in the hands of his trusted sextet of pitchers: Starters Scherzer, Strasburg, Corbin and Anibal Sanchez and relievers Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson. But the Astros put too much pressure on opponents, take too good of at-bats, and ultimately expose the weakest underbelly of their opponents. In the end, their desire for a dynasty \u2013 and a deeper core of trusted pitchers \u2013 wins out.\n\nJesse Yomtov \u2013 @JesseYomtov\n\nAstros in 5\n\nAs the only person in this crew to have picked every series correctly (no big deal), I'm going to stick with my prediction from the beginning of the month \u2013 and that's not a knock on the Nationals. Every game in this series should be a close one. The strong individual performances from the Nationals' starters and hitters are entirely sustainable, but they're going to have rely more on their relievers than they have to this point \u2013 and that's where the team's luck may finally run out.\n\nSteve Gardner \u2013 @SteveAGardner\n\nAstros in 6\n\nThe combination of dominant starting pitching and a restricted-flight baseball will have runs in short supply during this series \u2013 and will also make for close, exciting games. If any team has a chance to match the Astros\u2019 excellence on the mound, it\u2019s the Nationals. The Gerrit Cole-Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander-Stephen Strasburg matchups should be epic. However, it\u2019ll be extremely difficult for the Nationals to duplicate the .393 average with runners in scoring position they produced in the NLCS. The Astros\u2019 ability to make consistent contact will be the difference in the series as their relentless offensive attack \u2013 one that led the majors in on-base percentage AND fewest strikeouts in the regular season \u2013 will make the most of their scoring opportunities.\n\nScott Boeck - @ScottBoeck\n\nAstros in 6\n\nThe Nationals starting rotation has been dominant this postseason. And yes, their starters are all well rested, but the long layoff could come back to haunt them. MVP candidate Alex Bregman, Carlos Correa, George Springer and Yordan Alvarez combined to bat .138 in the ALCS against the New York Yankees. All reasons to pick the Nationals, but all trends that will come to an end. The Astros bats will wake up en route to a second title in three years.", "description": "The best-of-seven World Series begins on Tuesday in Houston, with the Astros looking to win their second championship in three years.", "authors": ["Usa Today Sports", "Published A.M.
