Here's what to look for next week.", "language": "en", "text": "The fourth week of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry in Congress was the busiest so far, with five different depositions, a fractious meeting of Republicans and Democrats at the White House, and a shocking press conference by President Trump\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nNext week will ramp things up even more. A key diplomat who called it \u201ccrazy\u201d for Trump to press Ukraine to investigate political rivals is expected to go to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, and he is just one of eight people whom Congress has asked to testify as part of its impeachment inquiry.\n\nA lawyer for Fiona Hill, a former senior adviser to Trump on Russia and European affairs, told the New Yorker that after his client\u2019s defiance of the White House\u2019s warning not to testify this past Monday, \u201cthe floodgates may have opened.\u201d\n\nNext week\u2019s schedule appears to back up that theory. Five of the eight officials called to testify are expected to do so, an official working on the impeachment inquiry told Yahoo News. That includes William Taylor \u2014 the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine \u2014 who texted a colleague that it was \u201ccrazy\u201d for the White House to withhold military assistance in exchange \u201cfor help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nThe appearance of Hill, a former White House official, and three other State Department officials before the impeachment inquiry this week has been described in starkly different terms by Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\u201cWitness after witness, especially the career public servants, came forward despite the risks to their own careers, and talked about how there was misconduct going on ... and they didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with it,\u201d Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., told NPR Friday morning.\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP) More\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, meanwhile, disparaged those who were testifying as having political motivations.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing now, I believe, is a group of mostly career bureaucrats who are saying, \u2018You know what? I don\u2019t like President Trump\u2019s politics, so I\u2019m going to participate in this witch hunt that they\u2019re undertaking on the Hill,\u2019\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is doubling down on the comment that Mulvaney made to reporters when defending the Trump administration\u2019s pressure campaign to try to force Ukrainian government officials to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals in the Democratic Party. \u201cGet over it,\u201d he told the press. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nBy Friday afternoon, the campaign to reelect Trump in 2020 was raising money off Mulvaney\u2019s comment, selling T-shirts with large white letters repeating it.\n\nBystanders in Washington remain unsure of how it will all play out.\n\n\u201cI have lost my ability to rate disasters anymore,\u201d one veteran Republican told Yahoo News, declaring himself \u201ckinda numb.\u201d\n\nThis week began with news of a chaotic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, leaving Kurdish fighters \u2014 who had helped a U.S.-led coalition defeat the so-called Islamic State \u2014 abandoned in the face of a Turkish invasion. Hundreds of Islamic State fighters who had been held by the Kurds are reported to have escaped.\n\n\u201cTrump seems to believe it\u2019s easy to raise an army and fight an enemy like ISIS. It\u2019s not. It takes years of work and it may be impossible now as the world sees a historic success upended in six days after a call with a foreign leader and in the most careless and callous manner,\u201d wrote Brett McGurk, who was the top Pentagon official overseeing the Trump administration\u2019s war against ISIS until a year ago, when he resigned early over Trump\u2019s announcement that he would withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.\n\nTrump\u2019s bumbling in Syria weakened him considerably inside his own party on Capitol Hill, where Republican senators and congressmen \u2014 who have either kept silent on impeachment or downplayed the significance of the Ukraine matter \u2014 blasted away at the president.", "description": "The fourth week of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry in Congress was the busiest so far, with five different depositions, a fractious meeting of Republicans and Democrats at the White House, and a shocking press conference by President Trump\u2019s chief of staff.", "authors": ["Jon Ward", "Senior Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Q34NykJ9.DwRD_0LLmKqWQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/3a166150-f1e9-11e9-bfb6-981f2b927e6a", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
