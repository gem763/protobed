That is quadruple the company's initial public offering price, but many Beyond Meat skeptics think the stock is grossly overvalued.\n\nBeyond Meat did report a strong quarter. Sales surged 250% from a year ago to $92 million, and the company had net income of $4.1 million, compared to a loss of $9.3 million a year ago.\n\nThe company also raised its outlook, but investors may have been disappointed because Beyond Meat's new sales guidance of $265 million to $275 million for 2019 is only slightly higher than Wall Street's current estimate of $264 million.", "description": "Even though Beyond Meat reported earnings and sales after the closing bell Monday that topped analysts' forecasts, that still failed to satisfy investors' appetite for something even more.
