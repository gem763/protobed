ANU astronomer Dougal Mackey says through studying our neighbouring galaxy, we found 'Andromeda had a pretty big breakfast maybe ten billion years ago' and a 'decent lunch much more recently, between two to three billion years ago'. Mr Mackey told Sky News astronomers are able to tell that these are different events because 'the remains of these destroyed galaxies and are moving on different orbits around Andromeda'. According to the astronomer, Andromeda has its sights set on the Milky Way as its next main course, but it is not expected to happen for at least another four billion years.

It is lucky we\u2019re not residing there!\u201d\n\nThe cataclysmic blast ripped through our galaxy and was likely felt 200,00 light years away in the Magellanic Stream.\n\nIt is considered to be a recent event because when it happened the dinosaurs had already been wiped out for 63 million years and human ancestors were already walking on Earth.\n\nThis black hole blast phenomenon is known as a Seyfert flare.\n\nThe astronomers think it would have created two enormous \u2018ionisation cones\u2019 that would have sliced through the Milky Way.\n\nThey think it was caused by nuclear activity in the gigantic black hole, known as Sagittarius A.\n\nIt is estimated to have lasted for around 300,000 years, which is extremely short in galactic terms.\n\nStephen Hawking dies aged 76 The greatest mind of our generation, Stephen Hawking, has died aged 76 following a long struggle with motor neurone disease.\n\nCo-author Magda Guglielmo from the University of Sydney said: \u201cThese results dramatically change our understanding of the Milky Way.\n\nRELATED: Mystery Planet X could be \u2018black hole\u2019\n\n\u201cWe always thought about our Galaxy as an inactive galaxy, with a not so bright centre.\n\n\u201cThese new results instead open the possibility of a complete reinterpretation of its evolution and nature.\n\n\u201cThe flare event that occurred three million years ago was so powerful that it had consequences on the surrounding of our Galaxy.\n\n\u201cWe are the witness to the awakening of the sleeping beauty.\u201d\n\nThe research was led by Professor Joss Bland-Hawthorn from Australia\u2019s ARC Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions (ASTRO 3D).\n\nDuring the study, data was gathered by the Hubble Space Telescope and used to calculate when and how the explosion took place.\n\nIt will soon be published in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Sun and was republished with permission.", "description": "The supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way exploded 3.5 million years ago, according to astronomers.", "authors": ["Charlotte Edwards"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f910b9b4196f7051d090167d699f6cf9?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
