He added that the alliance would be in place for the long term.\n\n\"Clearly, the Kingdom wants higher oil prices ... Prince Abdulaziz made clear that 'no radical' change in the Saudi oil policy is forthcoming\", said Tamas Varga of oil brokerage PVM.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see if we get any hint from him whether the producer group in general and Saudi Arabia in particular sees the need for deeper production cuts\".\n\nThe OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee (JMMC), which reports on compliance with the cuts, is due to meet on Thursday in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThere have been concerns about producers' adherence to the agreement as OPEC members Iraq and Nigeria, among others, exceeded their quota in August and Russia also did not fully comply.\n\n\"Markets will need to see concrete progress on the production front, even as the world's economy slows, to sustain gains,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.\n\nShould oil markets close higher on Tuesday it will be the longest run of gains since late July but headwinds remain due to U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report later Tuesday, after a surprise inventory build last week surprised analysts. The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on inventories is due to be released on Wednesday.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report", "description": "Oil Prices Hit 6-Week Highs Buoyed by Optimism on Output Cut Extension", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECBM0IW_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
