But two tech startups, Grillo and SkyAlert, are trying to improve upon it\u2014to the city government\u2019s irritation.\n\nCires\u2019 96 sensors, most placed on the Pacific Coast, detect seismic waves from an earthquake and transmit them via radio frequencies. If the quake is determined to be strong enough to cause damage, the alerts are broadcast on TV and radio and over a public address system that blares out prerecorded messages from roughly 12,000 loudspeakers mounted on telephone poles, and some 20,000 radio speakers in public schools.\n\nGrillo and SkyAlert are pushing a more digital approach, transmitting warnings more quickly via wireless internet networks, processing seismic data using cloud-computing and offering wider coverage through media including smartphone applications, Twitter , and in-home alarms.\n\nBoth companies have built their own networks of sensors using technology originally developed for cellphones, and have the backing of venture capital funds and major research universities in the U.S. SkyAlert aims to earn profits selling premium smartphone apps and its alarm devices, while Grillo\u2019s business model relies on selling data to insurers on neighborhoods and buildings that are most vulnerable to earthquake damage.\n\nThe city says having too many alert services is confusing for residents and can undermine confidence in the whole idea of early alerts.\n\n\u201cIf we continue to over-alert people, it will have two effects: we\u2019ll lose people\u2019s trust, and we\u2019ll cause mass panic in places like subway cars or in large office buildings,\u201d says Guillermo Ayala, who heads natural disaster early-warning efforts for Mexico City.\n\nMr. Ayala points to two alerts emitted by SkyAlert\u2019s application in August and February, which both overstated the magnitude of earthquakes and that he says caused tens of thousands of workers to leave work. He added that too many private companies seek to import cheap sensors from Asia without adapting them to Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe point is not to prohibit the emission of seismic alerts,\u201d Mr. Ayala said. \u201cThe more support we have, the safer we will be, but only as long as all the alerts comply with the technical regulations.\u201d\n\nRelatives of children who lost their lives during the 2017 earthquake in Mexico City prayed on the anniversary last year.

The company also offers a device for larger buildings like factories or apartment blocks called the Epicenter, which costs about $2,000 a year.\n\nIn response to the city\u2019s criticism of SkyAlert, Mr. Cantu said that no early warning system is perfect, and that more competition forces warning systems to improve. Mexico City\u2019s new regulation \u201csends a terrible message\u201d to people trying to make residents safer using technology, he said.\n\n\u201cIf we put in laws that limit innovation, we are doomed to forever have the same system that was installed years ago,\u201d Mr. Cantu said.\n\nMexico\u2019s public early warning system is the world\u2019s oldest, although Japan and Taiwan operate similar systems. It began in 1991, shortly after a 1985 earthquake devastated Mexico City, and began issuing public warnings via radio and TV in the mid-1990s.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should early warning systems for natural disasters like earthquakes be wholly the government\u2019s responsibility, or should Mexico and other countries tap the private sector for help? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn 2012, Mexico installed early-alert devices in public schools and launched the city\u2019s public-address speaker system. It expects to expand the number of loudspeakers to 18,000 by the end of next summer. Cires also commercializes its alerts via a device that costs about $2,000 and provides alarms for large buildings.\n\nPrivate sector firms could offer a similar system for far cheaper, according to Anglo-Colombian architect Andr\u00e9s Meira, who founded Grillo in 2014. His startup operates a network of roughly 50 sensors that it designs and has manufactured in China and broadcasts alerts on Twitter and through an app. Grillo plans to start selling a small, in-home early-alert device that costs around $50.\n\nMr. Meira says he is optimistic that Grillo will be able to comply with the new Mexico City regulation, which he described as vaguely worded.\n\nA seven-story office building was destroyed in the 2017 Mexico City earthquake.

Most smartphones contain a device called an accelerometer, which detects movement and allows phones to detect when they are being turned sideways, so that screen views can shift.\n\nThe profusion of smartphones has driven down the price of this technology, making it possible to buy a seismic sensor with an accelerometer in it for about $100. This is great news for poor countries that are vulnerable to tremors, such as Nepal, where a 2015 quake killed more than 2,000 people, says Diego Melgar, a seismologist at the University of Oregon.\n\nFighting over who is allowed to issue warnings is counterproductive, says Mr. Melgar, who is working on a public-private partnership in the U.S. to develop ShakeAlert, a public early warning system in California, because the more companies or agencies sharing data, the better we understand earthquakes and are able to prevent loss of life and property.\n\n\u201cMore sensors are most definitely a good thing, because they mean more accurate coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to need to be some sort of rapprochement eventually, where the government and the private sector come together and coordinate how to talk to the public.\u201d\n\nWrite to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com", "description": "Two years after a devastating earthquake struck Mexico City, killing more than 200 people and damaging thousands of buildings, the city\u2019s government is feuding with private technology startups over who is allowed to warn city residents about future quakes.", "authors": ["Robbie Whelan", "Robbie.Whelan Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109597/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
