He said the harassment goes as far back as 2015.\n\nFalobi also detailed a disturbing incident from August when went to the company's locker room and allegedly found his work uniform vandalized with white paint. It had the phrases \"Mak LZ Gr8t Again\" and \"Go S*** hole\" written on the back and front, the suit said.\n\nHe said his name had been ripped off the front and replaced with \"S-hole.\" His lawyers said they believe the messages were inspired by President Donald Trump, who once referred to Haiti, El Salvador and African countries as \"s***hole countries.\"\n\nKTRK\n\n\"These statements have their origin from President Trump\u2019s statement against immigrants, specifically, Trump\u2019s reference to Haiti, El Salvador and African countries, where he is reported as saying, \u201cWhy are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?,\" the Chukwurah Law Group said in a statement. \"Lubrizol\u2019s awareness of these despicable and discriminatory acts includes allowing Caucasian males to openly display Confederate flags and Swastikas inside the plant.\"\n\nA Lubrizol spokesperson declined to comment on pending litigation, but they said the company is\"committed to diversity and inclusion.\"\n\n\"Lubrizol is deeply committed to diversity and inclusion as critical pillars of our culture and company values,\" the company told ABC affiliate KTRK in a statement. \"We expect all of our employees to treat each other with dignity and respect, and we take all employee concerns relative to diversity and inclusion very seriously. At this time we cannot comment further on pending litigation.\"\n\nFalobi is suing for an unspecified amount of damages.", "description": "His lawyers said they believe the messages were inspired by President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/chemist-racial-lawsuit-ktrk-mo-20190925_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
