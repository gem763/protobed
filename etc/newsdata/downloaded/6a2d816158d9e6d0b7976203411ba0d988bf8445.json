As a gay, married man addressing a denomination that does not allow same-sex marriage rites, he tried to seek common ground over being members of minority groups whose civil rights have come under attack. It was a nod to his sexuality, following the disclosure last week that the Buttigieg campaign held focus groups that found some black voters in South Carolina were uncomfortable with a gay man as president.\n\n\u201cAll of us in different ways have been led to question whether we belong,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg told the pews of black worshipers. \u201cAnd I know what it is to look on the news and see your rights up for debate. All of us must extend a hand to one another. Because I also know what it is to find acceptance where you least expect it.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Buttigieg increasingly presents himself to Democrats as a younger, moderate alternative to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., he is struggling badly to compete against one of Mr. Biden\u2019s strengths: deep connections to black voters. Nowhere is that problem greater than in South Carolina, which votes fourth in the Democratic nomination fight in February and is the first state where black voters are decisive \u2014 a critical test that could be a prologue for primaries in March where African-Americans will also be influential.", "description": "A Buttigieg campaign memo that surfaced last week suggested \u201cbeing gay was a barrier\u201d to support from some black voters in South Carolina.", "authors": ["Trip Gabriel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/us/politics/27buttigieg-sexuality-01/27buttigieg-sexuality-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
