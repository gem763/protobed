Local media reported Monday that his offer to surrender himself to authorities in Taiwan, where he is accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend, was deemed insufficient by the Taiwanese, who insisted that formal talks were required to accept him within a legal framework.\n\nThe Hong Kong government had responded with a statement saying that the case should be handled informally, and that Taiwan\u2019s acceptance of Chan should have nothing to do with whether or not there is a mechanism in place for criminal judicial assistance, but was instead a matter of \u201ccommon sense.\u201d\n\nExperts say the complicated relationship between Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan is behind the standoff.\n\n\u201cIf Taiwan were to accept, Taipei would implicitly accept [its] position as similar to Hong Kong, as being a part of China,\u201d Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2019s Center for China Studies tells TIME. Taiwan, he says, only wants to accept Chan if it is done under a specific agreement\u2014in effect recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign entity and not the renegade province that Beijing says it is.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s credible evidence that the crime was committed,\u201d says Gregory Gordon, a law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong\n\n\u201cI think it would be problematic for this person not to face justice because of political issues,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the parties to see that a heinous crime was committed, and the person who committed that crime should face justice. If he walks out a free man in Hong Kong, justice is not done in a brutal murder case\u2014that\u2019s not a good result.\u201d\n\nElection issue\n\nTaiwan\u2019s upcoming January presidential election may also be playing a part in Taiwan\u2019s tough stance on the issue. Lam says that Taiwan\u2019s President Tsai\u2019s popularity has shot up dramatically since the Hong Kong protests kicked off in June.\n\n\u201cPresident Tsai Ing-wen is reluctant to give up the benefits she has reaped from Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement the past four months,\u201d Lam says.\n\nChan, 20, wrote a letter to the Hong Kong government on Friday confirming his decision to hand himself over to Taiwan authorities and asking the Hong Kong government to help him make arrangements to get to Taiwan. He has served 18 months behind bars on charges related to the theft of the victim\u2019s property.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post newspaper, Chan admitted to killing his girlfriend and disposing of her body while on a trip to Taiwan in February 2018. She had told Chan prior to the trip that she was pregnant, but while in Taiwan told him that the father of her unborn child was her ex-boyfriend, the Post says. Chan fled home to Hong Kong after the incident. Authorities in Hong Kong say they do not have enough evidence to charge him with the murder.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, used the case to justify an attempt to rush through a bill that would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which the territory has no extradition agreement. But the proposed legislation would have also allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China, which raised alarm bells with Hongkongers, who worried that the law would be used by Beijing round up dissidents and critics of the communist regime.\n\nOpposition to the proposed legislation\u2014which the government suspended in June and which Chief Secretary Cheung told media will be formally withdrawn at a meeting of the city\u2019s Legislative Council on Wednesday\u2014triggered mass protests in June. The protests have since snowballed into push for greater political freedom and a repudiation of Beijing\u2019s sovereignty over the former British colony.\n\nAdjunct professor Lam says that if Taiwan accepts Chan without putting a formal agreement in place, \u201cby some interpretations, it might be construed as accepting the basic rationale of the extradition bill.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive said it is a relief that Chan has offered to turn himself in, and that she hopes his decision will help calm the situation in the city.", "description": "Chan Tong-kai is set to be released from prison in Hong Kong on Wednesday", "authors": ["Amy Gunia", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r7WO6jGBdZxJGdbRRHAJkA--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/7acb6ace0468e16b30ee078e4606fee7", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
