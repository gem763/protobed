Other recent changes include a single listing of Mondi Plc (LON: ) (previously Mondi Ltd and Mondi Plc both formed part of the index), as well as the inward listing of Prosus, which was recently unbundled from investment holding company Naspers (JO: ).\n\nA summary of the TOP 40 constituents and their respective weightings on the index is as follows:\n\nTop 40 constituents\n\nTop ten index constituents\n\nTraders of the South Africa 40 Index will want to amend their watchlist to the below top 10 securities, whose combined weighting in the JSE Top 40 Index amounts to over 60% thereof.\n\nTop ten index constituents\n\nJSE Top 40 Gainers (year to date)\n\nA higher basket price for Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) has bode well for earnings from local miners thereof (Impala Platinum, Anglo American (LON: ) Platinum & Sibanye Stillwater). Platinum, palladium and rhodium prices have continued to soar this year gaining roughly 20%, 35% and 110% respectively.\n\nImpala Platinum has been the favored PGM counter gaining nearly 150% year to date, in turn earning its inclusion in the blue-chip (Top40) index once again. The gains follow a much-improved set of results for FY19 and show the cyclical nature of earnings relative to commodity prices. The group has managed to achieve strong free cash flow generation to return the company to a net cash position at year-end. Gross profit margins have moved to 14.1% from 3.2% in FY18, while headline earnings per share were realized at 423c from a headline loss in the previous year of 171c per share.\n\nSibanye-Stillwater has now, after 18months, concluded its takeover of Lonmin Plc, to become the world\u2019s second-largest platinum producer (behind Norilsk Nickel). The group's global operations include South Africa, Zimbabwe and the US. The share price has gained around 75% for the year thus far, despite the group reporting a headline loss of R1.3bn in the six months to June 2019. A five-month strike, within its South African gold mining operations, has more than eroded the earnings gained in the group\u2019s PGM operations over the period. Sibanye, since its acquisition of US-based palladium producer Stillwater, remains highly leveraged with net debt roughly 2.5 times the size of adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortisation). The group is, however, forecasting a strong second half of the year (EBITDA of R2.1bn) in lieu of more stable operations and higher precious metal prices.\n\nTraders will want to keep abreast of wage negotiations within the platinum sector currently underway, in lieu of the potential to disrupt production at least in the very near term.\n\nContinue Reading", "description": "Shares Analysis by Shaun Murison covering: Anglo American PLC, Mondi PLC, Naspers Ltd, Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd.
