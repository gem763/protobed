As an alternative, money managers say investors may want to put some money in higher-dividend-paying equities that tend to outperform when markets swoon.\n\n\"Conventional wisdom holds that you invest in bonds for yield and equities for capital appreciation,\" wrote Jonathan Golub, chief equity strategist at Credit Suisse. But now, stocks offer the \"best of both,\" he said.\n\nCalls for investors to ditch bonds grew after the yield for the 30-year Treasury briefly fell below the average dividend yield (link) for the broad-based equity benchmark S&P 500 this week for the first time in a decade. On Friday, the S&P 500 sported an average dividend yield of 1.92%, while the yield for the 30-year Treasury bond stood at 1.988%.\n\n\"If you do have that flexibility, income alternatives within the equity space can look attractive once those lines cross over,\" said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at State Street, in an interview.\n\nHow tumultuous was August? Treasurys soared as investors looked for havens amid an intensifying U.S.-China trade war. That sent yields tumbling, with the 10-year yield dipping below 1.50% and the 30-year yield falling to an all-time low below 2%. Stocks tumbled, with the S&P 500 down more than 5% for the month at its low.\n\nToned-down language out of Beijing and Washington soothed nerves somewhat in the past week, with the S&P 500 rallying 2.8% and trimming its monthly loss to 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average logged a 3% weekly rise to trim its August loss to 1.7%. The S&P 500 remains up around 16.7% year to date, while the Dow is up around 13.2%, with all major indexes a few percentage points away from all-time closing highs booked in July.\n\nRead:History says the stock market's volatile August paves the way for more losses in September (link)\n\nBut investors worry the stock market remains vulnerable to rising recession fears, particularly if the trade war escalates anew.\n\nThe value of high-dividend stocks as a source of stable performance was demonstrated in August. Utilities, real estate and consumer staples -- all known for funneling their profits to shareholders year after year and traditionally popular defensive plays -- were the only S&P 500 sectors to score gains in August.\n\nRelated:Seeking attractive dividend stocks?

Values for longer-maturity bonds are also more vulnerable to an easing of trade tensions or a burst of inflationary pressures if they lead to a sudden surge in interest rates.\n\nMark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management, wrote that \"the proliferation of negative yields across the globe has threatened the valuable diversification that high quality bonds have historically offered investors.\"\n\nStill, bond investors say that defensive stocks are no replacement for government debt as a hedge against a market downturn.\n\n\"Bonds are becoming an expensive insurance policy, but when you look at the landscape for available assets that can produce a negative correlation to equities, Treasurys are usually at the top of the list,\" Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. A negative correlation indicates the tendency for the values of two assets move against each other, that is, when risk assets swoon, bond prices surge.\n\nAdrian Helfert, director of multiasset strategist at Westwood Holdings Group, said higher dividend stocks can be seen as more resilient because of their record in delivering a steady income stream. But \"when markets go down, dividends get cut and that gets priced in for some securities,\" he said, in an interview.\n\nIn the event of a recession, corporate executives may have to slash payouts to shareholders to protect their own balance sheets. It's why investors say its important to examine which companies' earnings were robust and stable enough to weather an economic slowdown.\n\n\"To get real stability, we look for stocks that have increased their dividends over a long period of time,\" said Trey Welstad, portfolio manager at Integrity Viking Funds, in an interview.\n\nLooking ahead, investors face a holiday-shortened week, with markets closed Monday for Labor Day. The economic calendar features the Institute of Supply Management's closely watched manufacturing index on Tuesday, while the August jobs report is due on Friday.\n\nSee: Labor Day: Which markets are closed?
