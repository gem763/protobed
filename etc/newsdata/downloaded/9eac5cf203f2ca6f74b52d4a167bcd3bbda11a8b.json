Among them was a man in his 60s who was found with no vital signs in a flooded apartment in Kawasaki, NHK said. Seventeen were missing early on Sunday, it said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A firefighter makes his way through a flooded residential street in in Tokyo.

Some houses along the Chikuma river were nearly fully submerged in water and at least one person was rescued from the roof of a house by helicopter, NHK said. Part of a road was swept away in flooding.\n\nAuthorities issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across Japan as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Some 80 injuries were reported while more than 270,000 households lost power, NHK said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Surging waves generated by typhoon Hagibis hit the seashore in Mie prefecture.

It lifted the alerts early on Sunday.\n\nAuthorities said they were planning to release water from the Shiroyama dam, 50km west of Tokyo, to reduce the risk of it bursting. They urged residents of six nearby towns to protect themselves as discharging water into an area already experiencing torrential rain was expected to cause severe flooding. About 17,000 military personnel were placed on standby for rescue operations.\n\nThe giant storm measuring 1,400km across and capable of producing 200km/h winds was compared to 1958\u2019s typhoon Ida, which wrought destruction across the Greater Tokyo area and eastern Shizuoka prefecture, killing 1,200 people. The death toll is unlikely to be anywhere near as high this time thanks to Japan\u2019s stringent building safety standards and comprehensive disaster warning systems. Emergency alerts accompanied by loud chimes were being sent direct to tens of millions of smartphone users in the affected areas.\n\nBy Saturday morning roofs had been ripped off houses in Chiba prefecture. This area, immediately east and south of Tokyo, was still recovering from September\u2019s typhoon Faxai which killed three people, injured more than 40 and left hundreds of thousands of homes without power.\n\nOn Saturday a 50-year-old man was killed in Chiba when his car was flipped over by the wind, while another person died after being washed away in a car, NHK said.\n\n\u201cWhen the winds suddenly hit they blew the roof off my house,\u201d a resident told NHK. \u201cThe noise was awful. One of my three children was injured and is now in a hospital.\u201d\n\nAdding to the danger of landslides, an earthquake measuring four in Chiba on the Japanese seismic intensity scale, whose highest grading is seven, hit the Pacific Ocean at 6.22pm local time on Saturday.\n\nTokyo Disney Resort shut down on Saturday for the first time since the earthquake and resulting deadly tsunami in 2011 that killed nearly 20,000 people, while all bullet trains and most flights in and out of the greater Tokyo area and its surrounding prefectures were cancelled.\n\nThe Tokyo metropolitan government opened an evacuation centre in Tokyo\u2019s Ueno district for foreign tourists stranded by the shutdown. Organisers cancelled Saturday\u2019s qualifying session for the Suzuka grand prix, although the race was expected to take place on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe England v France World Cup rugby game, due to have been played in Yokohama on 12 October, was cancelled the previous day. A decision on Sunday\u2019s match between Japan and Scotland was due following an inspection scheduled late on Saturday night.\n\nScotland, who would be eliminated from the World Cup if the match were to be cancelled, called for the game to be switched to Monday. \u201cRight from the get go, we said we would play any place, anywhere, behind closed doors, in full stadiums,\u201d said Scottish Rugby\u2019s chief executive, Mark Dodson.", "description": "Threat of widespread flooding and landslides compounded by earthquake in Chiba prefecture", "authors": ["Jamie Doward", "Gavin Blair"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a097c515919ce29c3502275d1ecd382edfe946/0_86_2004_1202/master/2004.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65def39c5c2b238b00236008a3520432", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
