President Bill Clinton was forced by a unanimous Supreme Court to testify under oath in a civil lawsuit about the Whitewater controversy, which led to his impeachment for lying and obstruction. Meanwhile, during Watergate, President Richard Nixon faced multiple court cases that ultimately forced into the open details that prompted his resignation before the a full House vote on articles of impeachment.\n\nThe move may also force Pelosi to bring forward plans for a full vote on articles of impeachment against the current president. Democrats know they probably have the votes for the motion to carry and public opinion is shifting in their favour.
