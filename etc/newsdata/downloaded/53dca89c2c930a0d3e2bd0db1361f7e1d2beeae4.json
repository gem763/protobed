Employees of component companies, and fuel station workers, would get the same in the second and third year but a fixed 6% in the first year.\n\nNumsa says this offer does not differ from the employers' opening offer. \"They have hardly compromised, whilst we have compromised a lot. Throughout negotiations, they have stubbornly refused to deal with issues relating to working conditions as raised by our members.\"\n\nNumsa wants transport allowances \u2013 or a night shift allowance - for petrol station workers, and a review of the peace clause in a three-year wage agreement. The peace clause prohibits the union from striking during this time.\n\n\u201cWe remain open for engagement, however, we want to make it clear that we will only engage if employers radically shift their position. They must demonstrate that they are genuine about improving the lives of all employees in the sector.\"\n\n\n\nNumsa has now requested a meeting with CCMA to finalise picketing rules, as part of the process to get a strike certificate.\n\nCompiled by Helena Wasserman", "description": "'Employers must radically shift their position.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7628/957f32bcf1c848d6b400c9ae5871364b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
