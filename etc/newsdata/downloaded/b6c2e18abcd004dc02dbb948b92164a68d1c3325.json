It's the latest big contract for Microsoft, which has been pursuing deals with large players across the healthcare industry.\n\nThe two went through months of conversations and tests of Novartis' data collection as the Swiss pharma giant looked for a partner that could empower all of its more than 100,000 employees touse artificial intelligence in their everyday jobs.\n\nIn the end, a demonstration of Microsoft's technology in a bar in Novartis' hometown of Basel at the French border was crucial to sealing the deal, Peter Lee, the corporate vice president of Microsoft Healthcare, told Business Insider.\n\n\"We've been really impressed because there's a big push in Novartis to equip all their teams to be citizen data scientists,\" Lee said. \"The tools we're looking to build together are built to enable that.\"\n\nThose tools are expected to help everyone from bench scientists and sales representatives to data scientists to use machine learning or AI in their day-to-day jobs, Shahram Ebadollahi, the global head of data science and AI at Novartis, told Business Insider.\n\n\"This is the time to really bring strength of tech AI and bind it to the human biology to really push it forward,\" Ebadollahi said. Novartis is also starting up an AI Innovation lab, with Microsoft as a partner.\n\nRead more: The head of healthcare at Microsoft lays out the 3 ways AI will actually transform healthcare\n\nNovartis' push to get employees data-science savvy\n\nEmbedding technology into the company is something Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan has been pushing since stepping into the role in 2018.\n\nIn particular, Novartis has been using AI and data science to help find leads in creating new drugs, as well as with the company's workflow in departments like sales and finance, Narasimhantold Business Insider's Emma Court and Matt Turner in July.\n\n\"If you think back to where we were January of last year to where we are now, I think we're light years ahead of where we were,\" he said at the time.\n\nEbadollahi said there were two broad areas where Novartis, with the help of Microsoft researchers, was turning its attention at the start.\n\nThe first is using AI for exploration, seeing whether researchers can sift through Novartis' research data to find answers to some elusive questions. In particular, Novartis will be looking into cell and gene manufacturing, figuring out whether AI can suggest molecules that might make good drug candidates, as well as applying AI to imaging, particularly to help with the treatment of eye conditions like age-related macular degeneration.\n\nBut as Ebadollahi tells it, the more interesting area Novartis is focusing on is empowering its employees to use AI in their daily work.\n\nThe goal: \"How can you still actually do your job empowered by AI, without the requirements of becoming a machine-learning expert?\" Ebadollahi said.\n\nLee described one instance he'd observed already through his work with Novartis in which one team involved in clinical trials had a database with a large amount of unstructured notes.\n\n\"That data is hard to penetrate without the use of machine learning and reading tools,\" Lee said.\n\nAnd elsewhere, another team was conducting cell and gene-therapy work that might have been related to what the clinical-trials team was working on.\n\nWith the cultural shift happening at Novartis, there are more opportunities for the two teams to run into each other, Lee said, and in turn to have a way to share what they've learned through the help of the new data-reading and machine-learning tools that come as part of the partnership.\n\nTo be sure, getting 100,000 employees at a pharmaceutical company to all be AI-savvy won't be easy. The tools will have to come in handy and be easy enough to fit into everyday life, and it could take time to get there. But already, for instance, Novartis has already applied systems like Glint, owned by Microsoft's LinkedIn, to track the feedback employees have for Novartis' 15,000 managers.\n\nRead more: 'We're light years ahead of where we were': Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan told us how the Swiss drug giant is using AI for everything from evaluating managers to predicting its financials\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft is signing deals with industry powerhouses\n\nOver the past year, Microsoft has been making a big bet on signing deals with healthcare and retail giants like Walgreens and Walmart as it figures out how to tackle the massive healthcare technology market.\n\nThe tech giant in July brought on Providence St. Joseph Health, a West Coast-based health system that operates 51 hospitals and made $24 billion in revenue in 2018. Providence agreed to work with Microsoft for the next five years, using Microsoft's cloud services and AI tools, as well as designing health clinics in the Seattle area that draw on Microsoft technology.\n\nRead more: Microsoft is forging alliances with the likes of Walgreens and a massive hospital system in its own backyard to win a bigger piece of an $11 billion market\n\nBefore that, Microsoft became Walgreens' cloud partner, meaning Microsoft is in charge of managing Walgreens' data storage, and Walgreens employees will use Microsoft 365 for their office software. For consumers, Microsoft and Walgreens plan to test out health offerings, including 12 pilot \"digital health corners\" in stores. Microsoft has also struck up such alliances with Walmart and Kroger, both of which operate pharmacies.\n\nFacing cloud and AI competition\n\nCloud companies are in fierce competition for the healthcare market.\n\nAs healthcare companies \u2014 from health systems to biotech companies \u2014 have been amassing more information, there's an emerging race to see which company might benefit from storing that data on their respective clouds and what other platforms or tools might sway healthcare companies to work with them.\n\nAccording to Business Insider Intelligence, healthcare companies are projected to spend $11.4 billion on cloud computing in 2019. Amazon as of 2017 had about 46% of the cloud infrastructure market, while Microsoft had about 11%.\n\nAmazon and Google have been landing major deals as well. In July, the health information technology giant Cerner said it had made Amazon Web Services its preferred cloud provider as it moved its business from being hosted on its own data centers to the cloud. The Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic in September signed Google as its cloud and AI partner.\n\n\"Ultimately, we will work together to solve humanity's most serious and complex medical challenges,\" Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post in September.\n\nIn total, Lee said Microsoft had commercial relationships with 170,000 healthcare organizations. But only some of those involve coinvesting in projects with partners like Novartis and Providence.\n\n\"We're trying to be as selective as possible,\" Lee said in a July interview. \"Because these strategic alliance partnerships have an element of coinvesting and putting researchers to be devoted full time, we have limits on how many we can do.\"\n\nLee has focused on the \"six Ps\" in healthcare, he said. Those are patients, providers, payors, platform companies, pharma, and policymakers.\n\nWhen it came to finding a partner for the pharma \"P,\" Novartis emerged as the top company, particularly when it came to the company's culture.\n\n\"Shahram and I could switch places and nobody would notice,\" Lee joked. \"We're that like-minded.\"", "description": "The Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis and the tech giant Microsoft are teaming up to empower Novartis employees to use AI in their everyday lives.", "authors": ["Lydia Ramsey"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c4f74c12bdd7f51c3060c9a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
