The president, as you know, says he never pressured Ukraine\u2019s President Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden. But there\u2019s now reporting by a number of news organizations, including the Associated Press, that, as long ago as May, after the president\u2019s first phone call with President Zelensky, that he was strategizing, anxious, worried with his staff about how to deal with this pressure from President Trump.\n\nPENCE: Well, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s not what President Zelensky has said. He actually said there was no pressure. In his conversation with the president, he said\u2026\n\nWOODRUFF: But the people around him\u2026\n\nPENCE: that \u2014 that, in discussions that I had with him, that there was no pressure. And I think any American who takes time to read the transcript of President Trump\u2019s call with President Zelensky will see the president did nothing wrong. There was no quid pro quo.\n\nWOODRUFF: But in that transcript, Mr. Vice President, the president mentions Joe Biden. And he says to President Zelensky, \u201cI hope you will look into this,\u201d in a reference to what happened to Joe Biden\u2019s son, to Vice President Biden\u2019s son, and to Mr. Biden. What did you think when you read that in the transcript? Did you think that it was appropriate for the president of the United States to bring up a political rival?\n\nPENCE: Well, I think the president has made clear that his discussion in that matter was all about looking to the past. But \u2014 and I can tell you that, in \u2014 in the president\u2019s call, when the American people take time to actually read the call, which I know was greatly distorted by the way it was characterized\u2026\n\nWOODRUFF: But what did you think\u2026\n\nPENCE: \u2026 in the whistle-blower\u2019s report. The whistle-blower spoke about eight different references to the Bidens. That was simply\u2026\n\nWOODRUFF: But it\u2019s just the whistle-blower, Mr. Vice President. It\u2026\n\nPENCE: And \u2014 but the other thing, the other\u2026distortion, Judy, frankly, was when the chairman of the Intelligence Committee read into the record before the committee a fabricated version of the phone call.\n\nWOODRUFF: But it\u2019s not just\n\nPENCE: That\u2019s why, any time this topic comes up, I always tell people, make sure and sit down and read the transcript, and you will see there was no quid pro quo. The president did nothing wrong. And I can assure people that, in all of my discussions with President Zelensky on the president\u2019s behalf, we were completely focused on restoring the territorial integrity of Ukraine, standing with them against Russian aggression, helping to support their efforts to deal with corruption in their country\u2026\n\nWOODRUFF: But I \u2014 excuse me.\u2019\n\nPENCE:.. and enlisting more European support.\n\nWOODRUFF: Excuse me for interrupting. But to bring up Joe Biden\u2019s name, the man who is likely to be, may well be the Democratic nominee for president next year, did it raise a red flag with you? And, by the way, it\u2019s not just the whistle-blower. It\u2019s William Taylor, longtime respected diplomat, appointed by President Bush, reappointed by President Trump, who said \u2014 and I\u2019m quoting \u2014 based on everything he was told by people who talked to the president, that the president was withholding military aid for Ukraine and the promise of a White House meeting because they weren\u2019t committed to investigating the Bidens. This was in the transcript. You read that transcript. Do you \u2014 does Bill Taylor, William Taylor, have credibility, as far as you\u2019re concerned?\n\nPENCE: Well, are you referring to William Taylor\u2019s testimony before the committee?\n\nWOODRUFF: His account, the testimony, as far as we know.\n\nPENCE: Well, I \u2014 we can\u2019t really count on that, because all we have from the committee are leaks\n\nWOODRUFF: Well, we have his statement.\n\nPENCE: I mean, Judy, the \u2014 the process that\u2019s going on in Congress today is a disservice to the American people, and it\u2019s a disgrace. I mean, to have impeachment hearings taking place behind closed doors, and the only thing the American people learn about are piecemeal release, leaked apparently by the Democratic leadership on the committee to the press.\n\nWOODRUFF: This was his opening statement, 15 pages.\n\nPENCE: It\u2019s just unacceptable, Judy. The \u2014 the committee ought to release the entire record of all of their witnesses, how they responded, how they clarified points that they had made in their testimony. And the American people deserve to know that. I mean, the\u2026\n\nWOODRUFF: Again, it wasn\u2019t leaked. It was in his statement that he released to the public.\n\nPENCE: Well, yes, according \u2014 look, the American people have a right to know. Impeachment is a great and serious matter in the life of this nation, and the way the Democrats are conducting this so-called impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill, behind closed doors, is wrong. And they should \u2014 they should open this whole process to the light of day. They should release all of the transcripts.", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of PBS's \"NewsHour,\" anchor Judy Woodruff pressed Vice President Mike Pence on President Donald Trump's phone call with the | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/FirefoxScreenSnapz003-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
