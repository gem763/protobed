He\u2019s also convicted himself in full view of the world and the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cYou know to preserve our constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity. He should be impeached. That\u2019s not only because of what he\u2019s done. To answer whether he\u2019s committed acts sufficient to warrant impeachment is obvious. We see it in Trump\u2019s own words. We see it in the texts from state department officials that have been made public. We see it in his pulling much of the United States government into his corrupt schemes, individuals within the government, his appointees. But we have to remember that impeachment isn\u2019t only about what the president\u2019s done. It\u2019s about the threat the president poses to the nation if allowed to remain in office. One thing about this president is absolutely clear, and I don\u2019t think anyone can contradict this, he has seen no limits to his power regardless of what the Constitution says.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cHe believes the entire United States government can be corrupted into furthering his personal political needs. He\u2019s even willing to hold Congress and congressionally appropriated aid to a foreign nation hostage to his personal political demands. He believes if he does something, it\u2019s legal, period. And perhaps most importantly, he believes there is nothing we can do about it. He believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It\u2019s no joke. He\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we can not let him get away with it.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Wednesday, 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden at a town hall in Rochester, NH called for President Donald Trump to be impeached. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1173655366-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
