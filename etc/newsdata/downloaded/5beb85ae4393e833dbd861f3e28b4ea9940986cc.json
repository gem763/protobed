Then the Kincade fire hit. On Wednesday night, as the blaze burned near Geyserville, just a 30-minute drive north of her house, Edney could see the flames on the mountain ridge in the distance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sleep. The stress and anxiety are overwhelming. The constant thoughts of what happened two years ago just keep coming up,\u201d Edney said. Her house still has power by \u201cmiracle,\u201d as she put it, and she\u2019s decided to stay put even though they\u2019re in a mandatory evacuation zone. Her husband, David, a deputy sheriff for the county, has been keeping her posted with the latest fire news. She\u2019s packed and ready to go if he says the word.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go through this again. I just can\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\nThis month marked two years since the October 2017 fires, the deadliest in the state at the time, killed 44 people and burned 3,000 houses in Santa Rosa. The Tubbs fire leveled Edney\u2019s neighborhood of Coffey Park, turning block after block of houses into a field of ash.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the Kincade fire \u2015 one of 10 major blazes across the state \u2015 had grown to over 75,000 acres and was still only 15% contained, with more than 4,000 firefighters battling it. It\u2019s burned 124 buildings so far and spurred the evacuation of about 180,000 people from the area. More than 2,800 people stayed in Red Cross and other shelters across the state Monday night.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric also cut power to more than 2 million people in the region over the weekend in an attempt to prevent more fires as winds of over 100 mph blew through the area. On Tuesday, even as about 40% of those who\u2019d lost power still had not had it restored, PG&E launched another round of outages, which were expected to leave nearly 600,000 households in 29 counties \u2015 over 1 million people \u2015 without electricity by the end of the day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been every bit as traumatizing as the first fire without the actual loss of our home,\u201d Edney said, noting she\u2019s also been obsessively checking for fire updates online. \u201cI\u2019ve been fighting off having a breakdown for several days now, reminding myself to stay strong for my girls.\u201d\n\nThe Edneys Mellissa Edney with her 16-month-old daughter strapped to her back overlooking the spot where her house used to stand in the Coffey Park neighborhood of Santa Rosa, California, in October 2017.\n\nEdney hasn\u2019t been the only survivor glued to the news since the fire started. Jeff Okrepie, another Coffey Park resident who lost his home in 2017, has been constantly checking the Cal Fire \u201cincident map,\u201d Twitter and the National Weather Service.\n\nOkrepie stayed up all night Saturday monitoring evacuations. Finally, about 4:30 a.m., when the mandatory evacuations hit their area, he piled his wife, their 3-year-old son and 1\u00bd-year-old daughter into the car and drove to his niece\u2019s in Petaluma. They\u2019ve been there since, at one point totaling 11 family members and five dogs in the three-bedroom house. His sister\u2019s family, parents and grandparents had all been evacuated, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heightened stress and anxiety, short tempers,\u201d he said of what he\u2019s been feeling since the blaze started up. His family hasn\u2019t even moved back onto their property yet since their home burned two years ago \u2015 the house is still being rebuilt and is supposed to be ready by Christmas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just waiting for that Twitter post or alert that\u2019s like, hey, evacuation\u2019s been lifted,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re packing up and going home.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t go through this again. I just can\u2019t. Mellissa Edney, survivor of the October 2017 fires in Sonoma County\n\nCalifornia\u2019s wildfires have been breaking records over the past few years. Last year, the Camp fire near Paradise overtook the 2017 Sonoma fires as the deadliest ever in the state, killing 85 people and burning nearly 18,000 homes \u2015 about 150 miles northeast of Santa Rosa.\n\nPG&E, which has drawn outrage with its repeated power shutoffs this month, was linked to the igniting of the Camp fire when one of its electrical lines malfunctioned.\n\nPam van Halsema, who\u2019d just moved into her newly rebuilt home in Coffey Park earlier this month, was already \u201cfeeling on edge\u201d when the first power outages hit weeks ago. \u201cI found that really unnerving,\u201d she said.\n\nThen last Wednesday night, as she was leaving a \u201cresilience\u201d and \u201cself-healing\u201d group she led for neighbors dealing with PTSD from the 2017 fires, emergency responders driving through the area warned her of a blaze burning in Geyserville. She and a neighbor quickly climbed to the second floor of their rebuilt houses and saw the flames glowing on the far-off hill.\n\nEver since, van Halsema has been doing breathing exercises to try to calm her nerves. On Saturday night, as the winds picked up and evacuations spread, she packed her husband and two kids, ages 15 and 12, and their 60-pound dog into the car and drove to her sister\u2019s home in Santa Clara, south of San Francisco, pulling up at 2 a.m. She\u2019s been there the past few days, grateful for the electricity and the distance from the blazes, but also worried about her neighbors.\n\n\u201cRecovering from the stress and trauma of a fire is not something you just get over,\u201d van Halsema said. \u201cSo to have this repeat seems quite overwhelming and makes people wonder... how could I possibly do it again?... It\u2019s just too much.\u201d", "description": "The Kincade fire in Sonoma County is raging north of Santa Rosa, California, where fires burned thousands of homes and killed dozens of people two years ...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db8bada210000bb3634b67a.jpeg?cache=mjxhmk9fsh&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
