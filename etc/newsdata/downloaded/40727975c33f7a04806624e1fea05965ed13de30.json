Why, for example, is the short-form video app censoring the Hong Kong protests but not U.S. political content? Why is it banning political ads, but supports hashtags like #trump2020 and #maga, each with millions, or even hundreds of millions, of views? TikTok so far has struggled to answer these questions. Now, it\u2019s hoping to change that with the formation of a new committee of experts who will help TikTok craft its content moderation policies and increase transparency around these topics and others that afflict popular social media platforms.\n\nThat is to say, the committee\u2019s focus won\u2019t only be on political censorship \u2014 that\u2019s just the most important, hot-button issue facing TikTok in the U.S. today.\n\nHowever, TikTok says the new committee will advise across a wider range of issues beyond censorship, including also child safety, hate speech, misinformation, bullying, and other potential issues, both existing and those yet to come.\n\nTo aid in this, the company is working with a group from corporate law firm K&L Gates, including former Congressmen Bart Gordon and former U.S. House Rep, now government affairs counselor Jeff Denham, who bring their expertise in the technology sector to the initiative.\n\nK&L Gates was chosen for this initiative after TikTok talked to several firms for some time. It says that K&L Gates made the cut because it was considered to be a top-5 public affairs firm with an outstanding reputation, and because Bart Gordon\u2019s previous role as Chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology, in particular, offered TikTok strong expertise in the space.\n\nTikTok says its committee, which has not yet been formed, will look to include outside and independent voices to help it better craft its policies. It couldn\u2019t identify who else would be on the committee as those people haven\u2019t been selected.\n\nThe committee will focus on helping TikTok strengthen its own internal moderation teams, moderation and content policies, and overall transparency, the company says.\n\n\u201cTikTok is beloved because it provides an outlet for creative expression and a uniquely genuine and inspiring app experience. It\u2019s amazingly rewarding to know that we\u2019re bringing joy to so many \u2013 but it also brings great responsibility on our part,\u201d said TikTok U.S. General Manager, Vanessa Pappas, in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to meeting this responsibility fully,\u201d she added.\n\nInitially, TikTok will create the committee of outside experts with the help of its new advisors at K&L Gates. It will then increase its transparency around content moderation and continue to build out a deeper bench of internal leaders in order to tackle the challenges caused by its rapid expansion.\n\nThis effort has been in the works for some time, and is not a result of the increasing amount of bad press around censorship on the platform.\n\nBut the decision to announce the news of a committee formation is an attempt by TikTok to help manipulate the narrative here. The reality, however, is that TikTok isn\u2019t censoring all political content or just the \u201cnon-fun\u201d stuff, as it would have you believe. If that were true, then there would be no TikTok hashtags focused on U.S. politics \u2014 like #dumptrump or #trumptrain, for example. Nor would the app offer tags for causes like #blacklivesmatter or its controversial counterslogan (with racist undertones), #alllivesmatter.\n\nThe news comes at a time when TikTok is again coming under the eye of the U.S. government. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) just sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Wednesday requesting that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States look into ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, for its 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly. The letter claims that there is \u201cgrowing evidence\u201d that TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform is engaging in censorship.\n\nTikTok, before today, had admitted its content guidelines were out of date, and said it took localized approach to its moderation choices. But a hashtag like #hongkong in TikTok show \u201cbarely a hint of unrest,\u201d The Washington Post recently reported.\n\nWith legal \u2014 and soon, independent \u2014 advice and strategic consulting in the works, TikTok hopes to figure out how a Chinese-owned app can participate in the democratic U.S. social media market, without becoming another mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party.", "description": "As TikTok continues its rapid U.S. growth, the company is being challenged to better explain its content moderation choices.
