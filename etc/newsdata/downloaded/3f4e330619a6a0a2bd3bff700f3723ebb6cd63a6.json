This led some 20 cultural, religious and educational organizations of the district to work together with the city government to revive the tour.\n\nA royal marching band will kick the revived tour off with a parade around Deoksu Palace at 6:30 p.m. on Friday. As before, the event will offer a variety of hands-on activities, performances and guided tours.\n\nFrom next year the program will take place once a year in spring.\n\n\"It will be held every May starting next year,\" a city government official said. \"We'll make the program a major festival of the city, giving citizens a chance to learn about the significance and history of the area.\"", "description": "Popular Night Tours of Seoul's Historic Quarter to Resume This Week", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/22/2019102201186_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
