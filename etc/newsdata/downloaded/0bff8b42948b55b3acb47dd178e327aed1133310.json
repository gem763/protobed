For these stateless corporations are the major importers, into King County and the surrounds, of a high-tech, feudal elite, thus compounding the homeless quagmire.\n\nThe corporations who straddle the globe rely on immigration ignoramuses to perpetuate the single-cause theory of homelessness: addiction or mental illness.\n\nHowever, even if drug addiction and mental illness are seen as necessary in causing homelessness, they are seldom sufficient. Substance abuse and mental anguish can, in themselves, be the consequence of other exogenous, existential and intractable circumstances.\n\nLike being priced out of your homeland\u2019s housing market. For good.\n\nBig Tech must be quite pleased to see homelessness attributed exclusively, by the usual cast on TV, to addiction and mental illness\u2014when, in fact, homelessness is driven, primarily, by the systematic and permanent eviction from the housing market of vulnerable, working-class people.\n\nIn truth, our country is consigning its economically weakest members to the homeless encampment, through the never-ending importation of a high-rolling, high-tech elite, which, in turn, artificially inflates the price of housing. In perpetuity.\n\nAccording to the Seattle Times, \u201cfewer than 50 percent of people without homes are addicts.\u201d \u201cThere are more families with children than chronically homeless people\u201d in the encampments.\n\nUnderlying homelessness are factors such as \u201closs of a job,\u201d \u201ceviction,\u201d medical bills and foreclosure, the last of which \u201cdestroys credit ratings, making former homeowners no longer eligible for loans or, in many cases, rentals.\u201d Forever.\n\n\u201cWe must no longer allow politicians, policy influencers and the media to get away with the laziness of conflating substance abuse and homelessness,\u201d inveighs Lola E. Peters.\n\nPeters, a local writer, is correct. Alas, while implicating the tech-driven population explosion in our state\u2019s housing crisis, Ms. Peters frames the unrelenting influx from China and India as though it were organic; a natural, made-in-America population explosion.\n\nIt isn\u2019t! Seventy-one percent of Washington state\u2019s population growth is attributed to net migration!\n\nIn guarded language, the Washington State Office of Financial Management divulges that, \u201cMigration continues to be the primary driver behind Washington [State\u2019s] population growth. From 2017 to 2018, net migration (people moving in versus people moving out) to Washington totaled 83,700, \u2026 \u2026 The state has grown by an average of 87,900 persons per year this decade, exceeding that of 83,000 in the previous decade.\"\n\nKing County, where the aforementioned \u201cglobal beasts with vast balance sheets\u201d live, \"is the main contributor, with a total growth of 259,000 persons over eight years, compared to 194,200 persons between 2000 and 2010,\" the report adds.\n\nFueled in large part by the technology industry, an average of 236 people are moving to the Seattle area each day,\u201d seconds Geekwire.com, a Seattle-based website that covers tech news.\n\nOnly those unfamiliar with America\u2019s work-visa labyrinth would claim that the unremitting population influx comes mainly from other states in the Union, rather than from other countries in the universe.\n\nCertainly, the town where I live is unrecognizable. What was a small and friendly hamlet is flooded with newly imported H-1B labor, living on six-figure salaries, while young Washingtonians struggle to pay the mortgage, or are evicted when their rental units are demolished to make way for fields of pricey, garish condominiums, to house Satya Nadella\u2019s preferred\u2014and privileged\u2014workforce.\n\nFor residents, this lamentable state-of-affairs means the inability to afford homes in a market in which property prices are being artificially inflated.\n\nYoung couples line up to view tiny apartments. They dream of that picket fence no more, as colonies of imported workers, endowed with sizeable salaries, push prices of property beyond the means of local lads and lasses, who simply can\u2019t afford homes in which to raise families. (And, no, H-1B Visa recipients are not cheap AT ALL, unless you call a six-figure compensation package \u201ccheap.\u201d)\n\n\u201cAt its root, the crisis is a supply problem,\u201d jabbered an \u201cexpert,\u201d in The New York Times.\n\nReally? Whatever happened to the demand side of the supply-and-demand, housing-market equation?\n\nBy grant of government privilege, through its immigration policies, a ceaseless demand for housing has been generated.\n\nBig Tech is permitted to petition The State for permission to import The World at a price heavily subsidized by the disenfranchised American taxpayer.\n\nHow can such an artificial market\u2014designed to sate the global corporation\u2019s insatiable lust for high-tech talent not American\u2014ever normalize, to accommodate local yokels? It can\u2019t.\n\nImagine being priced out of your homeland\u2019s housing market. For good. That\u2019ll drive a person to seek solace in mind-altering substances.", "description": "Big Tech and the other multinationals are exacerbating the problem .09/30/2019 20:05:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Ilana Mercer", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/33/3b65b0dd-e915-4d34-b6ab-536c0d4b3fd1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
