Far from it. In fact, he's amassed over $1 million.\n\nBut he wasn't always successful. At one point he couldn't pin down a steady job, was living at home, and had just $2.26 left in his bank account \u2014 barely enough to afford a cup of coffee.\n\n\"The journey really started with just feeling shame and worry, like I disappointed my parents,\" he said in an exclusive interview with Business Insider. \"There's an expectation in our culture to always get better, always perform, always chase the next thing \u2014 better better, more more.\"\n\nBut Sabatier didn't let this notion discourage him. He used it as the fuel to change his life.\n\n\"I went from being completely broke, unemployed, living with my parents at 24, to a year later I had saved over $200,000,\" he said. \"I set a really arbitrary goal to try to save $1 million as quickly as possible.\"\n\nToday, he says his net worth is well above $1 million.\n\nSo how did he do it?\n\nSabatier was able to grow his wealth exponentially by focusing on a part of the personal finance conversation that seems to fall by the wayside: his income.\n\n\"Unfortunately, most of what's written about money \u2014 or what exists in the money world \u2014 falls into one of three buckets,\" he said. \"A complete scam, designed to perpetuate fear, or advice that's so widespread that people think that it's truth.\"\n\nHe continued: \"There's a limit to how much you can cut back, but there's not really as strong as a limit how much money you can make.\"\n\nA focus on income\n\nThat's an important note. Conventional wisdom says an individual needs to focus religiously on their spending and saving, but very few advisers expound on increasing ones' income. It's an area Sabatier centralized his efforts around \u2014 and in doing so, he was able to materially change his life.\n\nHe started an array of side-hustles \u2014 ranging from building WordPress websites to managing Google ads \u2014 which eventually snowballed into stand alone businesses. It was this entrepreneurial spirit that led him to a 7-figure net-worth.\n\nSabatier put tons of time and energy into growing and marketing his skill sets \u2014 and was rewarded accordingly for his efforts.\n\n\"We live in a time where so many people are stressed about money, but it's literally never been easier in history to make enough money to live a life you love,\" he said.\n\nBy no means is he suggesting that saving is less important than income, or to save less. Sabatier is simply suggesting an equal focus on maximizing ones earning power.\n\n\"I viewed saving as an opportunity, not a sacrifice,\" he said.\n\nIt was this shift in mindset that really set him on his path to financial freedom.\n\nWhat makes Sabatier even more unique is that he's never once used a budget.\n\nHe realized that if he reined in his spending on his three biggest expenses \u2014 housing, transportation, and food \u2014 a need for a budget wouldn't be necessary.\n\n\"I realized pretty quickly \u2014 once I got on this path \u2014 it's going to be easier for me to save the most amount of money where I spend the most amount of money,\" he said. \"If I can reduce my housing expense, my transportation expense, and my food cost \u2014 I'm about 70% of the way there.\"\n\nThis led Sabatier to drive an $800 car, live in a \"crappy\" apartment, and cut back on eating out.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Sabatier shares his best advice for getting ahead in today's world.\n\n\"The trifecta is really: cut back on the biggest expenses, increase and diversify your income, and then invest the largest percentage of your money so that your money can start working for you,\" he said.\n\nSabatier concluded: \"Financial freedom is not even about having millions of dollars and being to retire early, it's about having enough money that you have control over your time, and you're able to live a life that you want \u2014 not a life that you're beholden to because you're reliant on your job or a bi-weekly paycheck.\"", "description": "Grant Sabatier, founder of Millennial Money, changed his life by focusing on one side of the personal finance equation he says is often overlooked.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db99ff7dee019576721b045?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
