Over 70% of credit-eligible Gen Z consumers has a credit card.\n\nThe number of those who belong to Generation Z carrying a credit balance has risen by 41% over the past year to 8 million people.\n\n\u201cOne of the first products consumers have is a card or a student loan,\u201d Kristen Bataillon, a senior manager of research and consulting at TransUnion, said. \u201cAbout a quarter of Gen Z had both a credit card and a student loan, and just under half have a credit card and no student loans.\u201d\n\n\u201cMillennials came of age during the Great Recession, whereas Gen Z is becoming credit eligible during one of the strongest economies we\u2019ve seen in years,\u201d she told MarketWatch. \u201cThat makes a comparison difficult because a strong economy increases consumer confidence, and that is indicative of credit participation.\u201d\n\nGeneration Z consumers \u2014 defined as individuals born in 1995 or after \u2014 are typically more frugal than their millennial counterparts. This, experts say, is largely a result of the economic environment in which many members of Gen Z grew up. Whereas millennials began entering the workforce during the Great Recession, Gen Z watched it all go down from the sidelines.\n\nMillennials began entering the workforce during the Great Recession. Gen Z watched it all go down from the sidelines.\n\nThey are more likely to start saving money at a younger age, according to a 2018 survey from the National Society of High School Scholars. Gen Z has also seen firsthand the burden of student debt that millennials \u2014 often their older siblings \u2014 are carrying. Borrowers today leave college with approximately $30,000 of debt on average.\n\nAnd this number is making Gen Z think twice about taking on massive loans to pay for their education. Gen Z students are more likely than millennials to say they work a part-time job in college to offset the cost, according to a 2019 TD Ameritrade TD, +0.17% study. And they\u2019re more likely to consider a less prestigious college to save money.\n\nFor those hoping to avoid debt, opening a credit card \u2014 and risking taking on credit card debt \u2014 may not seem like the best idea. But there are some benefits. \u201cThe earlier you open a card, the longer your credit history and that\u2019s an important component of your credit score,\u201d Jim Wang, the founder of financial advice blog WalletHacks, told MarketWatch.\n\nIt could take seven to 10 years for most individuals to fix their credit scores after making a mistake when they\u2019re young. \u2014Jim Wang, the founder of financial advice blog WalletHacks\n\nA good credit score typically increases your chances of getting approved by a landlord for a rental, gives you better odds of getting approval for a loan, and allows you to borrow money at a lower interest rate.\n\n\u201cGetting a card early gives you more time to learn how to be responsible with credit,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWhen you get a card early, it often has a lower credit limit.\u201d\n\nFor responsible borrowers, there are advantages to opening a credit card at an early age. But if you\u2019re not careful, you can get yourself in trouble quickly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think you can handle the responsibility of having thousands of dollars in spending power, it\u2019s not a big deal to wait a few years,\u201d Wang said.\n\nShe predicts says it could take seven to 10 years for most individuals to fix their credit scores after making a mistake when they\u2019re young.\n\nMarsha Barnes, a certified financial social worker and the founder of The Finance Bar, predicts that Gen Z will be more responsible with credit than millennials. \u201cThere are more conversations around money happening on campuses today than there were for millennials.
