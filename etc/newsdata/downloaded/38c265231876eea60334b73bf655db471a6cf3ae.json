The U.S. withdrawal from the area clears the way for a military assault by Turkey, which views the Kurdish-led SDF as a threat to its own security.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday that the withdrawal had begun.\n\nMr. Trump rejected the idea he was withdrawing as a special favor to Mr. Erdogan or playing into geopolitical rivals\u2019 hands with the move.\n\n\u201cThe two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China, because they love seeing us bogged down, watching over a quagmire, & spending big dollars to do so,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cWhen I took over, our Military was totally depleted. Now it is stronger than ever before. The endless and ridiculous wars are ENDING! We will be focused on the big picture, knowing we can always go back & BLAST!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said he will punish Turkey with economic ruin if it steps of line, once the U.S. withdraws.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!),\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cThey must, with Europe and others, watch over the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Ben Wolfgang contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
