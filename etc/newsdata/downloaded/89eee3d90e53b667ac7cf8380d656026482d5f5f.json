Magzine was an LGBT activist and charity volunteer, as well as a dedicated policy adviser for the DWP, advocating for disadvantaged people\n\n'No apology will bring her back but he has never apologised to us.\n\n'He did not consider her long term health when treating Magzine and didn't provide her with even a basic level of care.\n\n'I will never forgive him.'\n\nPatel was a dentist at Confidential Clinics in Purley, Surrey and treated the woman in the summer of 2017, extracting five of the patient's teeth on July 13 and five teeth on July 18.\n\nMagzine, who wasn't married and had no children, lived with her older brother Andrew, who found his sister in a 'pool of blood' that apparently resembled a 'crime scene'\n\nMagzine (pictured with her close friend Janet) has been described as a 'passionate friend' who was 'so sharp, full of sparkle, loud and infectious'\n\nDocuments from the General Dental Council (GDC) said Magzine told her dentist she was taking warfarin, a blood-thinning medicine to treat a clotting condition.\n\nDr Patel extracted five of the patient's teeth on July 13 and five teeth on July 18, but didn't pack or suture her wounds properly, the report said.\n\nThe GDC panel heard Dr Panel failed to discuss with her the complex needs and increased risk of bleeding, or do proper checks to assess her risk of post-operative bleeding.\n\nA JustGiving page was set up in Magzine's (pictured) memory by one of her close friends, Janet Connelly, to raise money for LGBT charity London Friend\n\nThe report said he should have taken out a maximum of three teeth at a time.\n\nMagzine went to A&E at King's College Hospital, London, for help before returning home where she collapsed on July 19.\n\nMagzine, who wasn't married and had no children, lived with her older brother Andrew, who found his sister in a 'pool of blood' that apparently resembled a 'crime scene'.\n\nShe died later that day.\n\nDawn said: 'The next thing I heard was that Andrew had rang an ambulance because she collapsed.\n\n'I'm not convinced he (Dr Patel) thought about what he was doing.\n\n'It doesn't feel like he gave her even average level of care.\n\n'I think she was just a number to him, just someone else to get out the door.\n\n'The challenge for me is that a 12 month suspension is nothing. The sanction is nowhere near strong enough for what has happened.\n\n'He might be a dentist again next year, whereas we will be without Magzine forever.'\n\nAt a hearing last week a GDC professional conduct panel suspended Dr Patel for 12 months.\n\nPatel, who has 30 years of experience, admitted the allegations of misconduct that were put to him.\n\nPatel was a dentist at Confidential Clinics (pictured) in Purley, Surrey and treated the woman in the summer of 2017, extracting five of the patient's teeth on July 13 and five teeth on July 18\n\nAccording to the report, he expressed remorse and has apologised to the patient's family.\n\nBut Magzine's siblings have said no one in the family has received an apology from Dr Patel.\n\nMagzine's siblings have said no one in the family has received an apology from Dr Patel\n\nDawn paid tribute to her sister, who she described as a 'committed' community volunteer who loved to help other people.\n\n'She had lots of friends and did so much for the local community', said Dawn.\n\n'She set up a support group for the LGBT community and was always smiling, was always happy and was a very positive person.\n\n'Magzine was only concerned about fighting other people's corner and always stood up for people.\n\n'She loved to help people and we are very proud of her for that.'\n\nA JustGiving page was set up in Magzine's memory by one of her close friends, Janet Connelly, to raise money for LGBT charity London Friend.\n\nOn there she paid tribute to her 'passionate friend' who was 'so sharp, full of sparkle, loud and infectious'.\n\nOther friends described her as 'an amazing woman'.", "description": "Magzine Gordon, 48, died after dentist Tushar Patel removed all her top teeth in two sessions in the same week.
