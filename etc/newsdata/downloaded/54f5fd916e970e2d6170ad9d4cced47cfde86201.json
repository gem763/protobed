The S&P 500 climbed 0.7% to 2,887.94 while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4% to end the day at 7,856.88. Chevron and Exxon Mobil contributed to the Dow's gains, rising 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively.\n\nThe S&P 500 energy sector jumped 1.4%, led by a 10.6% surge in Cimarex Energy, as U.S. crude prices surged more than 1%. Oil jumped after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories plummeted by 10 million barrels last week. Crude gained settled at $55.78 per barrel.\n\nConsumer stocks such as Tiffany and Kohl's also rose 3% and 3.4%, respectively. Tiffany posted quarterly earnings that beat analyst expectations.\n\nHowever, trading volumes remained subdued ahead of the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) traded just over 55 million shares. That's well below its 30-day volume average of 81.8 million shares. Lower trading volumes can lead to bigger swings in markets.\n\nStocks started off the session trading lower as the bond market continued to flash a recession signal.\n\nThe closely watched spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and the 2-year rate briefly fell to negative 6 basis points Wednesday. The move extended losses from the previous session when the spread registered its lowest level since 2007.\n\nA 10-year rate below the 2-year yield is viewed by fixed income traders as an important recession prognosticator, marking an unusual phenomenon as bondholders receive better compensation in the short term. Meanwhile, the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield fell to a new record low on Wednesday.", "description": "Stocks rose as energy got a lift from oil prices, but the gains were capped with a key part of the U.S. yield curve inverting even further.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106074474-1565625765193rts2mast.jpg?v=1565625814"}
