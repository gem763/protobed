August's tally, the strongest monthly growth since mid-2011, lifted the headline consumer inflation by more than 1 percentage point in August.\n\nOverall meat prices, including pork, beef and mutton surged nearly 31% in August, compared with July's 18.2% increase, as more consumers shifted to other meat items for protein.\n\nFollowing are price-growth rates for subindexes: Subindex August July YoY% YoY% Food 10.0% 9.1% Fresh vegetables -0.8% 5.2% Fruit 24.0% 39.1% Pork 46.7% 27.0% Nonfood 1.1% 1.3%\n\nThe CPI increased 0.7% in August from July. In July, it rose 0.4% from the preceding month.\n\nThe government aims to keep consumer inflation under about 3% in 2019.\n\nChina's producer-price index fell 0.8% in August from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said. In July, PPI fell 0.3% on year.\n\nThe drop was slightly smaller than a 0.9% decline expected by economists.\n\n-Grace Zhu and Liyan Qi\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nStory corrected on September 10, 2019 at 0517 GMT.
