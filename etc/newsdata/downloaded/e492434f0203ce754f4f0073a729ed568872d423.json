Everyone got to pay this year so we clear.\"\n\n\"Antonio Brown is not in the building today,\" Mayock said in a press conference Thursday. \"He's not going to be practicing. I don't have any more information. When we do, I'll get it to you. That's it for today.\"\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, the confrontation did not get physical. However, the two needed to be separated by players, Rapoport said on NFL Now.\n\n\"After a screaming match, Brown told Mayock that he would hit him in the face and then punted the ball ... and said, 'Fine me for that,'\" Rapoport tweeted.\n\nAccording to ESPN, the Raiders plan to suspend Brown.\n\nThe altercation is only the latest headline in Brown's first season with his new team. Brown was initially held out of training camp due to a mysterious foot injury that turned out to be frostbite caused by improper footwear during a cryotherapy treatment.\n\nRead more: Antonio Brown's mysterious foot issue is reportedly frostbite caused by not wearing proper footwear in a cryotherapy machine\n\nDispleased with being unable to wear his preferred helmet, which no longer met NFL standards, Brown went \"radio silent\" with the Raiders and filed two grievances with the league.\n\nMayock told reporters it was time for Brown to be \"all-in or all-out\" with the team.\n\nBrown eventually chose a new helmet and it appeared the offseason saga would be over until Wednesday's Instagram post, which has now escalated.\n\nIt is unclear how long the Raiders plan to suspend Brown for. The NFL's collective bargaining agreement states that the maximum suspension for conduct detrimental to the team is four weeks.\n\nRegardless of whether Brown is on the field, the Raiders kick off their season on Monday against the Denver Broncos.", "description": "Antonio Brown's messy start with the Oakland Raiders continued on Wednesday when Brown got into a screaming match with general manager Mike Mayock.", "authors": ["Alexandra Licata"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7150f82e22af6842457e55-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
