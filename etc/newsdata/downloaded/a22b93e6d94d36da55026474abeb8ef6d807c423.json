This as the police are investigating a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, crimen injuria and the pointing of a firearm against him.\n\n\"We're supposed to look up to him. He plays for the Bokke\"\n\nSA Rugby, meanwhile, has also launched an internal investigation into the allegations.\n\nWilsnach, 42, and Shiyaad Smith, 21, claimed Etzebeth assaulted them by striking them in the face with a firearm.\n\nSmith told News24 Etzebeth was, to him, \"the face of South African rugby\".\n\n\"We're supposed to look up to him. He plays for the Bokke. [What happened] changed the way I see him,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the pair's lawyer, Nigel Samuels, Etzebeth is a legal gun owner. He said Etzebeth's firearm had been sent for DNA testing to determine if it had been used in the incident.\n\nIt is alleged Etzebeth and a large group of friends reportedly used a racially loaded word against someone in a pub in Langebaan after ostensibly being harassed by a group of people at a nearby table who taunted him, saying he was a \"shitty\" rugby player.\n\nBuang Jones of the Human Rights Commission addresses Langebaan residents. (Tammy Petersen, News24)\n\nA scuffle allegedly broke out between the two groups.\n\nEtzebeth responded to the allegations on his Facebook page.\n\nHe said: \"It is completely untrue and unfounded to claim that I physically or racially abused anyone in Langebaan as has been reported on social media. Multiple witnesses can corroborate that.\n\n\"I am and will always strive to be a true ambassador to this beautiful rainbow nation and the sport that I love.\"\n\nSammy Claassen of the Khoisan Defiance Campaign said they wanted justice for those involved as well as the \"banning of the h*tn*t word, as it has the same discriminatory meaning as the K-word used against black Africans\".\n\n\"It has the same meaning and deep level of discrimination. It should be banned in its strongest terms by the courts and be regarded as hate speech.\"\n\nHe charged the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) was \"dragging its feet with the criminal case\", which he argued was in the public interest.\n\nThe public has a right to know the truth\n\n\"The public has a right to know the truth. Here, we have victims who were severely assaulted, traumatised and denied sufficient justice and a trial to tell their story before a court of law. The victims have a right to justice and the protection of the law. The NPA must act without fear or favour.\"\n\nClaassen claimed when white people were involved in crime, they received special treatment.\n\nThis while the victims were apparently targeted by those who call them liars, drunkards and useless people who \"must be moered\", he claimed.\n\nClaassen told locals in the community hall that the outrage was not aimed at distracting from the World Cup, but \"about the serious racism in Langebaan.\"\n\nAt the meeting, SAHRC spokesperson Buang Jones said the commission did not care about the offender's prominence or standing in society, \"whether you are Eben Etzebeth, Adam Catzavelos or Angelo Agrizzi\".\n\n\"We don't care whether you are a Springbok player. We don't care about your colour\"\n\nEtzebeth was a criminal suspect in a police case who was representing South Africa at the World Cup, Jones said.\n\nHe criticised SA Rugby for selecting Etzebeth for the spectacle in light of the serious allegations.\n\n\"We don't care whether you are a Springbok player. We don't care about your colour. We have to act. We look at the facts, and the facts from the statements obtained suggest there is a case to answer to.\"\n\nJones said the SAHRC had also obtained and reviewed video footage, claiming this was not the first time Etzebeth had engaged in such conduct.\n\n\"He always got away with it. But this time around, it stops here,\" he added to thunderous applause.\n\nWhen the floor was opened for comments, one man criticised people for finding Etzebeth guilty before he has had his day in court, while another said SA Rugby had failed coloured people by sending Etzebeth to the World Cup before the allegations were tested in a court of law.", "description": "Enver Wilsnach, one of two people who alleged they were assaulted and racially abused by Springbok Eben Etzebeth, has told News24 he is disappointed in the rugby star.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9436/a8f3b1225f0d4ee4ace0e95655f8d855.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
