Tribal leaders vow that won\u2019t happen again next week.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Native American voting groups have made it their mission over the years to get as many of their members to the polls as possible. That effort has even greater urgency, as North Carolina prepares next week to hold one of its most closely watched elections ever.\n\nThe 40,000 voting-eligible Lumbee tribal members living in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District could swing the special election for the tightly contested U.S. House race pitting Republican Dan Bishop against Democrat Dan McCready.\n\nAhead of next Tuesday\u2019s vote, tribal members have been knocking on doors to encourage their neighbors to get out to the polls. Working with the Native voting-rights group Four Directions, more than two dozen members of the Lumbee tribe have been hired to visit every home on the reservation, and to even drive people to the polls if necessary.\n\nJust 26% of eligible Native voters cast ballots in last year\u2019s election. Harvey Godwin Jr., chair of the Lumbee Tribe, told ThinkProgress that there are various reasons that fewer Native people turn out at the polls than he would like, and not all of them have to do with voter suppression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSometimes people don\u2019t want to vote, sometimes they don\u2019t have transportation, and a lot of times, it\u2019s apathy,\u201d Godwin said, adding that organizers \u201cuse whatever strategies we have to increase the number of people at the polls who are Lumbees.\u201d\n\nHowever, it seems a sound bet that \u2014 although no one knows for sure just how many votes from the Lumbee Tribe were caught up in the election fraud \u2014 voter suppression played a role in a good number of Native ballots that were never cast last year.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 then-candidate Mark Harris garnered around 1,000 more votes than McCready during November\u2019s midterm election for the congressional seat.\n\nThe state board of elections ordered a new special election, however, after it was discovered that longtime Republican operative McCrae Dowless had orchestrated a brazen absentee ballot scheme that boosted Harris\u2019 vote total and suppressed votes for McCready. The district\u2019s 700,000 residents have gone without congressional representation since January.\n\nAccording to a Four Directions analysis, 62% of all requested absentee ballots in the election were not returned in Robeson County, the jurisdiction where many Lumbee Tribe members live. That\u2019s a significantly higher percentage than the statewide rate of 16%, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the North Carolina Board of Elections.\n\nWe\u2019ll \u201cuse whatever strategies we have to increase the number of people at the polls who are Lumbees.\u201d\n\nThat Indian votes might have been discarded or altered angers many in the community, but they aren\u2019t exactly surprised. Native Americans were not guaranteed the right to vote in every state until 1962. They still faced a flurry of barriers expressly designed to make it difficult for them to cast a ballot. In recent elections, Native people in some states have been forced to drive hundreds of miles to cast a vote, overcome restrictive voter ID laws, and stare down intimidation tactics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven today, Native Americans in Republican-governed precincts remain easy targets for election fraud. They tend to vote Democratic, and often do not understand election law. Once turned away, they are unlikely to return to a polling booth.\n\n\u201cI think the right-wing in the country has a big stake in depressing the votes in communities that are impoverished, the votes in communities that have been historically denied equity in society as a whole,\u201d said Judith LeBlanc, director of the Indian advocacy group Native Organizers Alliance.\n\n\u201cWe believe, given the atmosphere in the country and the use of racism as a tool to divide people, there will be attempts to continue to depress and deny the vote of communities of color, and Indian voters especially.\u201d\n\nVoter suppression in Indian Country has become a more visible issue in recent years. During the Frank LaMere Presidential Candidate Forum in Sioux City last month, a number of Democratic candidates pledged to fight to end the practice if elected president.\n\nThe two-day event ended with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) giving an impassioned, five-minute speech explaining that such tactics were created because Republicans could no longer win elections on their own.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take on voter suppression in all of its forms. That means you don\u2019t make it impossible to get to a polling place, which was your case. It also means we move to a system that says very simply, that in the United States of America, if you are 18 years of age or older, you have the right to vote, end of discussion,\u201d the senator said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take on voter suppression in all of its forms.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the current reality, but Native groups are vowing to fight until it is. Their efforts go beyond this year\u2019s election, however: The NC-9 race is a dry-run ahead of the 2020 election, when Natives expect Republican voter suppression tactics to be turbocharged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe goal of Native organizers heading into the 2020 presidential election is to rally historically high Indian voter turnout in competitive swing states like Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Colorado \u2014 as well as North Carolina.\n\nLumbee tribal members need to drive long distances to the polls or cast a ballot in front of mostly white poll workers who may not always be accommodating. Once they finally arriving at their voting precincts, Native poll watchers will be on hand to ensure that Natives are not being wrongfully denied their right to vote. In North Carolina, they are conducting get-out-the-vote campaigns and monitoring the polls to ensure Indian votes are actually counted.\n\nOutside interest groups have poured more than $4 million into the race. By contrast, as of last week, Four Directions operated on a shoestring budget of about $30,000 ($4,000 per day), which they used to pay Lumbee Indians to drive fellow tribal members to the polls, according to Semans. A fully robust operation would require $200,000, the group\u2019s executive director O.J. Semans estimated. \u201cThis scenario that we are going into now with District 9 and North Carolina, is going to be similar to every case that we talk about within the seven states, where we say that the Native vote can make a difference,\u201d Semans told ThinkProgress, pointing to past successes his group has had boosting voter turnout in states like North Dakota, South Dakota and Nevada, despite blatant voter suppression tactics.\n\nSometimes however, organizing isn\u2019t enough, and activists have had to resort to the courts to ensure that Native votes are counted. In 2014, for example, courts ruled in favor of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in a pair of lawsuits against two South Dakota counties. The ruling significantly reduced the long distances that tribal members living on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation needed to travel to make it to the polls.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1162982736.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
