I\u2019m not worried about him \u2013 he\u2019s going to have a great time. If he does struggle, he\u2019s got good support from many quarters, as well as me. But I am distraught and feel isolated. My husband isn\u2019t his dad, and none of my stepchildren went to uni. My husband sees them regularly, so he can\u2019t relate. I love my husband, but we started with few common interests and over the years we\u2019ve become more different. This new situation has highlighted the fact we are not the functioning couple we were. My job pays well and is fulfilling, but I work long hours and I\u2019m often exhausted. I feel as though everything anchoring me has gone with my son moving out and I\u2019m floating around, wondering what the hell I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve decided to make no major decisions just now, but I\u2019m dreaming of selling everything I own, buying a motorhome and travelling the country. Where do I go from here? How do I cope with the massive, empty hole that was occupied by my child?\n\nMariella replies That\u2019s a toughie. I know that being part of a crowd doesn\u2019t dissipate pain, but you are certainly not alone. Among my friends and in my mail bag there\u2019s a steady stream of, mainly, women expressing similar sentiments. I often wonder if the reason is because there are still plenty of us whose lives have been largely centred on parenting. That\u2019s bound to make the chasm when kids leave feel bottomless. We\u2019re also less likely to have hobbies to fill our downtime: shouting at our favourite teams from the sofa, or chasing a small ball around a fairway, for example.\n\nThe heavier domestic burden most women bear during child-rearing years may feel frustrating at the time, but I\u2019m beginning to think that it\u2019s the selfless eschewing of extracurricular activities that does women most harm. The other day, as I walked my dogs, I had a moment of panic about my future, realising I had no proper hobbies \u2013 unless you count lying horizontal with a book until the dogs need a poo.\n\nLike so many women, you\u2019ve put yourself at the bottom of your priority list for too long\n\nA small step for womankind would definitely be to stop dividing life between work and home, and to nurture pursuits that will occupy us when the other two are no longer so time-consuming. With your demanding job and long hours I daresay you\u2019re not sitting in your kitchen gazing at your boy\u2019s favourite mug with tears running down your cheeks. But keeping busy just means that, like so many women, you\u2019ve left yourself at the bottom of your priority list for so long it\u2019s become a habit.\n\nOur increasingly prolonged lives would be a lot easier to navigate if we could divide them into sub-sections: childhood, adolescence, career, coupling, marriage, parenting, career reboot, parenting your parents and Dignitas. That\u2019s pretty much the way mine would be carved up. It may not represent your categories, but each of us has the opportunity to customise our own waypoints. Have you read The Salt Path? It\u2019s the story of a middle-aged couple, experiencing their own extreme version of a mid-life crisis \u2013 homeless and with a chronic illness prognosis \u2013 who walk the 630-mile South West Coast Path. The book has struck a chord with many mid-lifers, harbouring dreams of escape \u2013 and it certainly celebrates taking the less-trodden path.\n\nThe wisest thing you\u2019ve said is that you are not making any dramatic decisions immediately. Many couples at this juncture look at the person they\u2019ve shared school runs and domestic duties with for a couple of decades, not to mention a bed, and wonder where that person went. Having, as you describe, \u201cfew shared interests\u201d at the start can easily metamorphose into even fewer, but that doesn\u2019t mean all is lost. Finding yourselves home alone could also be the perfect incentive to kickstart your relationship and discover new passions.\n\nYour husband may yet surprise you with his appetite for adventures. If you can still bear being in each other\u2019s presence you\u2019re already doing better than many. Working out if you have potential for a different sort of relationship, rather than abandoning it without further consideration, seems a good place to start. Have a planning session with paper and a pen \u2013 so analogue, I know \u2013 and create a bucket list of all the things you\u2019d both still like to do. There\u2019s bound to be some crossover and that\u2019s where you begin the process of reinvention. The onward momentum and change needed to keep our spirits alive and adrenalin levels up consistently catches us off guard.\n\nWhether your future includes your partner or is inviting you to shake off your fetters, this is a moment for celebration rather than trepidation. You\u2019ve raised a great kid, who\u2019s doing what he should be doing. Make it easier on all of you by greeting what lies ahead with relish. There\u2019s no more appealing parent to spend time with than the one who\u2019s busy and fulfilled rather than dripping over you like a leaky shower the minute you walk through the door. Absence is an opportunity, a space to be filled, a life to reinvent. Get to it without further ado.\n\nIf you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.
