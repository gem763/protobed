It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences,\" the NBA commissioner said.\n\nChina Daily said the change from what it dubbed a \"honey-mouthed statement\" by Silver \"shows his organization is willing to be another handy tool for US interference in the special administrative region.\"\n\n\"If Silver thinks endorsing the indiscriminate violence the radical Hong Kong protesters are resorting to in their bid to 'liberate' the city, a secessionist pipe dream they are peddling to justify their summer hooliganism, is supporting freedom of expression then he should think again,\" the newspaper wrote.", "description": "Chinese state media slammed NBA head Adam Silver's remarks in apparent support of a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting anti-government protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Arjun Kharpal"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104607912-GettyImages-546682394.jpg?v=1532563791", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
