But authorities have come under fire for using it to crack down and monitor dissent, particularly in the surveillance-heavy region of Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big risk ... that the state could use this data for their own purposes, such as surveillance, monitoring, the tracking of political dissidents, social and information control, ethnic profiling, as in the case with Uighurs in Xinjiang, and even predictive policing,\u201d says Adam Ni, China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney.\n\nChina\u2019s hi-tech war on its Muslim minority Read more\n\n\u201cThis is certainly one of the more contentious aspects of the gathering of facial recognition data and the usage of them.\u201d\n\nDespite the concerns over data security and privacy, many consumers seem unperturbed by facial recognition payment in the high street.\n\nAlipay \u2013 the financial arm of ecommerce giant Alibaba \u2013 has been leading the charge in China with devices already in 100 cities.\n\nThe firm is predicting enormous growth in the sector and recently launched an upgrade of its \u201cSmile-to-Pay\u201d system, using a machine roughly the size of an iPad.\n\nAlipay will spend three billion yuan ($420m) over three years on implementing the technology.\n\nTencent, which runs the WeChat app with 600 million users, unveiled its new facial payment machine called \u201cFrog Pro\u201d in August, while a growing number of start-ups are trying to tap into the burgeoning industry.\n\n\u201c(Facial payment) certainly has the potential to become popular with the wide push from major mobile payment players,\u201d says Mengmeng Zhang, an analyst at Counterpoint.\n\n\u201cAlipay is spending (billions) to popularise facial payment technology through giving out subsidies for vendors and rewards for consumers that use facial payment,\u201d she adds.\n\nAt the IFuree self-service supermarket in Tianjin, a 3D camera scans the faces of those entering the store \u2013 measuring width, height and depth of the faces \u2013 then another quick scan again at check-out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s convenient because you can buy things very quickly,\u201d says retiree Zhang Liming after using facial payment for her groceries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different from the payment in the traditional supermarket, in which you have to wait in the checkout line and it\u2019s very troublesome,\u201d she argues.\n\nBo Hu says 300 of his bakeries have facial payment systems, and he plans to introduce them in 400 more.\n\nHe believes it makes the checkout process more efficient, but concedes the numbers using the new technology are still modest.\n\nSupporters of the technology wave aside privacy concerns.\n\n\u201cThe facial recognition technology helps to protect our privacy,\u201d explains IFuree engineer Li Dongliang.\n\n\u201cIn the traditional way, it\u2019s very dangerous to enter the password if someone stands beside you. Now we can complete the payment with our faces, which helps us secure our account,\u201d he insists.\n\nBut for many consumers, it is vanity rather than privacy that puts them off using such systems.\n\nA poll by news portal Sina Technology found that over 60% of respondents said scanning their faces for payments made them feel \u201cugly\u201d.\n\nIn response Alipay pledged to introduce \u201cbeautifying filters\u201d into all the Alipay cameras.", "description": "New technology is rolling out across the country, despite concerns over privacy", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90326f354634e16c4ba5393d86c04774ec861406/0_134_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=307ac2214d9eb4d7a12d5aca3f36c1e7"}
