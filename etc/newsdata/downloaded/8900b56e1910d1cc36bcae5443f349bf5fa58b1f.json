Japan and China begin robotic food delivery trials in offices and colleges", "language": "en", "text": "China and Japan have unleashed a fleet of delivery robots for a test program in Bejing and Shenzhen.\n\nFood delivery giant Meituan-Dianping has partnered with 10 hotels and office buildings to test a new mobile delivery robot to carry food deliveries to students and office workers at their desks or dorm rooms.\n\nUnlike other delivery bots, these variants are designed to navigate both elevators and stairs to bring the order directly to your door -- and they do so with a 'smile\"\n\nHowever, the program still relies on a human delivery person to bring the food to the office building lobby or carry it onto the university campus, but once there the robot's take over.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nThe Chinese food delivery giant Meituan-Dianping is testing robot delivery vehicles (pictured above) to help deal with rising demand in China\n\nMeituan-Dianping has targeted offices and universities in part because their layouts are easier to navigate than bustling city centers.\n\nThe robots can navigate both elevators and stairs.\n\nAccording to the head of Meituan's autonomous delivery department, who spoke at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in China earlier this year, the program is meant to help the company deal with rapidly growing demand for its delivery services, CNBC reported.\n\nBy 2025, Meituan expects to deliver three times as much food as it does currently, and it expects to hire and additional 30,000 to 35,000 human delivery workers to work alongside the robots.\n\nThe CarrieRo Deli (pictured above) is being tested in Japan. Developed by Japanese tech company ZMP, the robots are considered a 'last mile delivery service'\n\nIn Japan, companies are turning to robots to make up for a workforce that's estimated to have shrunk by 20% by 2040.\n\nThe Japanese tech company ZMP Inc. has developed a food delivery robot called CarriRo Deli, a 'last-mile delivery service' that's being tested in apartment complexes.\n\nIn the United States, Domino's Pizza was among the first to get into the automated food delivery market when it began using small robotic trucks to deliver pizzas in a pilot program in Texas.\n\nIn the UK, both Tesco and Co-Op have started an experimental program to make deliveries using small robots equipped with GPS, which can also be piloted by a human in a control center.\n\nA delivery robot built by Starship (pictured above) delivers lunch to office workers on break in London", "description": "Tech companies in Asia have begun test programs using wheeled robots to deliver food orders to office workers and hotel guests, which are said to be even faster the human workers.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/16/19259886-0-image-a-8_1570115997936.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
