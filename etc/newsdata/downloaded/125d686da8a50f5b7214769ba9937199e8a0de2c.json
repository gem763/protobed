Benny Gantz, with final polls ahead of the vote suggesting that neither has a clear path to forming a government.\n\nThe government-formation process will take several weeks, possibly running up against the U.N. meeting. If it is clear Mr. Netanyahu is no longer the prime minister, he is unlikely to go.\n\nNegotiations on a mutual defense pact could take months. Such a pact would obligate both sides to come to each other\u2019s defense in the event of military conflict, and would go beyond the significant intelligence sharing already under way, though the sides would have to work out the details.\n\nMr. Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White party, came out against the possible defense pact earlier this month. Mr. Gantz and many other members of Israel\u2019s security establishment believe a defense pact could limit the Israeli military\u2019s freedom of action by forcing closer military cooperation between the allies.\n\n\u201cThis is not what we want,\u201d Mr. Gantz said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t asked anyone to be killed for our sakes, we haven\u2019t asked anyone to fight for us, and we haven\u2019t asked anyone for the right to defend the state of Israel.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe U.S. has several mutual collective defense arrangements, the most prominent of which is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Under NATO\u2019s common defense provision, known as article 5, if any of NATO\u2019s 29 countries is attacked, all NATO countries are considered to be under attack as well and obligated to join in defending the target. The alliance was designed as a defense treaty to deter aggression from what was the Soviet Union.\n\nMr. Netanyahu has been campaigning on the strength of his relationship with President Trump and other world leaders and has been looking to Mr. Trump to show his support before the vote.\n\nAhead of Israel\u2019s April elections\u2014which Mr. Netanyahu won but then failed to cobble together a coalition\u2014Mr. Trump recognized Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and hosted Mr. Netanyahu for a visit in the White House.\n\nSince Mr. Trump has been president, he has recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and taken Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s advice to pull out of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal.\n\nRecently, Mr. Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have been urging Mr. Trump not to hold discussions with Iran President Hassan Rouhani, arguing that Washington should continue to increase economic pressure on Tehran.\n\nIsrael has been carrying out airstrikes in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon aimed at combating Iran\u2019s ability to move weapons it could use to strike Israel and to prevent Iran from entrenching itself close to Israel\u2019s borders. It has stepped up the campaign in recent weeks, which officials said was tied to Hezbollah\u2019s acceleration of efforts in Lebanon to build precision guided missiles.\n\nWrite to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com and Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump said he discussed a possible \u201cmutual defense treaty\u201d between the U.S. and Israel in a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, signaling support for the embattled leader days before a tough re-election vote.", "authors": ["Catherine Lucey", "Felicia Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107129/social", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
