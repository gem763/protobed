He said it\u2019s important not to forgot those who were lost.\n\nNevada Gov. Steve Sisolak recalled cellphones ringing as he joined officials walking the shooting scene the morning after the massacre.\n\n\u201cMany that would never be answered,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo years ago, Sisolak led the county commission that oversees the Las Vegas Strip, where a concert turned to horror as people suddenly dropped \u2014 bleeding \u2014 ran to escape the spraying bullets and tried to save people they loved.\n\n\u201cBeyond the neon signs, we are a city of neighbors that look out for each other,\u201d the first-term governor said.\n\nThe memorial audience was smaller than last year, but emotions were still raw for Al McIldoon, father of Jordan McIldoon, a 23-year-old from Maple Ridge, British Columbia, who died in the shooting.\n\n\u201cWe feel the need to be here for our son,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, his wife, Angela McIldoon, and their friend Paul Poteat of Las Vegas wore matching NHL Vegas Golden Knights jerseys, No. 58, with the name Jordy Mac on the back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep coming every year,\u201d Al McIldoon said.\n\nSteve Darling and Judy Gardner of Ontario, California, wore T-shirts with the name of Judy\u2019s daughter, Dana Gardner, a 52-year-old mother of three enjoying the music with her own daughter when she died.\n\nThey said they planned to join hands with survivors and other families of victims at the concert venue across the Las Vegas Strip from the Mandalay Bay resort-casino, where the shooter unleashed his attack.\n\nMGM Resorts International, owner of the hotel and the venue, has announced plans to convert the now-shuttered concert space to parking while it plans a community center and a place to remember victims.\n\nDarling and Gardner said they already visited a community healing garden, where Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman planned to read the names of the victims at the time the gunfire rang out: 10:05 p.m.\n\nGreg Zanis, who made wooden memorial crosses with victims\u2019 names and photos, put them up again at the iconic \u201cWelcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\u201d sign.\n\nThe Vegas Strong Resiliency Center, which offers financial help, counseling referrals and legal aid for those affected by the shooting, promoted daylong outreach wellness programs.\n\nThe shooting lasted nearly 11 minutes before gunman Stephen Paddock killed himself as police closed in. Police and the FBI found the 64-year-old retired accountant and high-stakes video poker player meticulously planned the attack, and they theorized that he may have sought notoriety. But they said they never found a clear motive.\n\nPolice recovered 23 assault-style weapons, including 14 fitted with bump stock attachments that allow firearms to fire rapidly like machine guns. The Trump administration banned the devices in March.\n\nNevada and some other states have tightened gun laws in the two years since the shooting, including passing \u201cred flag\u201d measures that allow a judge to order weapons be taken from someone who is deemed a threat.\n\nGun control advocates say they\u2019re frustrated more hasn\u2019t been done.\n\nTwo prominent gun control organizations will host a forum Wednesday in Las Vegas for 10 leading Democratic presidential candidates focusing on the issue.\n\nEfforts to combat gun violence follow other recent mass shootings, including at a Florida high school last year that killed 17 and attacks in Texas and Ohio that killed 31 people in one weekend this summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that it takes more and more of these shootings to bring attention to a topic,\u201d said Liz Becker, a volunteer with the gun control advocacy group Moms Demand Action.\n\nBut \u201cI do think that the tide is turning,\u201d she said.", "description": "\u201cBeyond the neon signs, we are a city of neighbors that look out for each other,\u201d Nevada Gov.
