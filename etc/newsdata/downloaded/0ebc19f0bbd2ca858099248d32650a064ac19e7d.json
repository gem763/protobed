(Sept. 2) AP\n\n\"South Park\" is doubling down on criticism of Chinese censorship.\n\nDays after issuing a sarcastic apology to China after its government decided to ban the animated show following an episode critical of the country, \"South Park\" is clapping back yet again.\n\nIn the latest episode \"SHOTS!!!,\" which aired Wednesday, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone showed their true feelings over the ban by having character Randy drop an F-bomb.\n\n\"(Expletive) the Chinese government,\" he says, after agreeing with his partner, Towelie, to no longer sell marijuana to China.\n\n\"South Park\" also shared a GIF of the scene to its Twitter account along with the hashtag #BannedInChina.\n\nNot only is the episode making headlines for the controversial comment, it also marks a milestone as the 300th episode of the Comedy Central series.\n\nThe show's previous episode, titled \"Band in China,\" satirizes the entertainment and sports industries' willingness to abide by Chinese censors in order to corner its business market.\n\nAt one point in the episode, an entertainment executive notes characters can't include Winnie the Pooh in a biopic, because the animated character is \"illegal in China because some Chinese students said he looked like the Chinese president.\" At another, Randy (Trey Parker) is stuck in prison for attempting to bring marijuana into the country to sell. There, he meets Winnie the Pooh, also stuck behind bars.\n\nParker and Stone later issued an \"official apology,\" sarcastically slamming the Chinese government's decision to ban not only their episode, but two NBA preseason games set to be played in the country.\n\n\"Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,\" the \"official apology\" read. \"We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful!
