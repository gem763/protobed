The image was released by the National Iranian Oil Tanker Company yesterday\n\nRussia and Iran are allied with the regime of Bashar al-Assad, while the Saudis support the opposition.\n\nBut 'it is important for Russia that an Arab country participates in the political settlement in Syria,' said Lukyanov.\n\nSo far 'only three non-Arab countries' - Turkey, Russia and Iran - are hosting talks, he said.\n\nIn terms of business, the visit is expected to result in around 30 agreements and contracts, according to Ushakov.\n\nAround a dozen of these - in the advanced technology sectors, energy and infrastructure - will be signed by the Russian Sovereign Fund and are worth around $2 billion.\n\nIn October 2017, Russia and Saudi Arabia also signed a memorandum of understanding paving the way for Riyadh's purchase of Moscow's powerful S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems.\n\nThe sale never materialised, however, as Saudi Arabia eventually opted to purchase a US system.\n\nAfter Saudi Arabia, Vladimir Putin will travel to the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday to meet the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit Saudi Arabia today, where he is set to seal oil agreements as well as use his influence to defuse rising tensions in the Gulf following a tanker attack.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/10/19684064-0-image-a-67_1571044743383.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
