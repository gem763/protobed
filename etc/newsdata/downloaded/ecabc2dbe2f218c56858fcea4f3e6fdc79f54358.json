I verified who he was supposed to be riding with, and he indeed had the right information.\n\nThis happens somewhat frequently, where someone will order a ride for someone else. I personally don't like it, because I don't know exactly who is getting in my car. Why don't they have their own account? Were they barred from the app? Are they hiding something? What is the reason?\n\nRelated: I'm a driver for Uber and Lyft \u2014 here are 10 things I wish I knew before starting the job\n\nThis guy seemed nice enough. He sat in the back and popped his headphones in, and I started the ride. \"This ride has two stops,'' the voice on the app said.\n\nNine miles and 30 minutes later, I pulled up to the first stop; it's a daycare. He hopped out and said he'd be right back. Maybe the woman who ordered the Lyft ride works at this daycare and he's picking her up.\n\nI have too much faith in humanity.\n\nA few minutes later, he walked back to my car along with a very small child and no car seat.\n\nHe tried pulling on my door, but I had already locked it. He started pounding aggressively on my window. I rolled down the passenger window and kindly asked him, \"Where is your car seat?\"\n\n\"I don't have one,\" he said. \"Let me in. It's fine. It's really fine.\"\n\nNo. It's not fine. It is really, really, not fine. Not only is it illegal to drive with a young child who's not in a car seat, but each year hundreds of children die in Florida because they ride without one. I'm not going to jail, nor am I going to be in one of those statistics, all for five bucks.\n\n\"I'm sorry. If you don't have a car seat, then I can't take you,\" I said.\n\n\"No, it's fine,\" he said. \"The other Ubers do it all the time.\"\n\nThis is where it gets tricky for drivers. The law says children 5 and under must be in a car seat, but how do you know who is 5 years old? Are you going to ask a child for their ID? What if there is a really big 5-year-old, or a very small 6-year-old? How do you tell the age? And are you supposed to believe the parent? How do you know they're not lying?\n\nUber and Lyft aren't exactly helpful here either and almost try to remain neutral. Uber says that it expects everyone to follow local laws but that it's up to a driver whether they want to accept a ride. Lyft also says children may require a car seat if local laws require it. In some cities, Ubers and Lyfts can come equipped with car seats, but not in my city.\n\nLuckily for me, this child was clearly 3 or 4 years old and 100% needed some type of car seat.\n\n\"Let me in or else!\" the man said.\n\nOr else you'll walk home? OK, I'm done here. The ride is done. I'm not going to deal with this. Now I know why this guy doesn't have his own Lyft account.\n\nI pulled away and ended the ride, with the guy chasing my car waving his arms in the rearview mirror. I immediately called Lyft support to tell them what happened before this guy, who apparently doesn't care about the safety of his child, reports me in a false claim of some kind. I told Lyft the story and was assured everything would be taken care of.\n\nI got another request nearby, this time on Uber. It was a nice lady who works at a DMV who, ironically, told me she hates driving. This ride also has two stops. She's very nice, and we're having a good talk.\n\nI pull up to the first stop. It's another daycare.\n\nOh no.\n\nLet me give her the benefit of the doubt.\n\nA few minutes later, she walks back out of the daycare with a baby, except this child is in a proper rear-facing car seat. She got in, strapped the baby in, and thanked me for waiting. Off we go. I dropped her off at her apartment a short while later.\n\nShe told me I was super nice and that she would tip me in the app once she got upstairs and got her hands free. There's an inside joke among drivers that when people say \"I'll tip you in the app,\" they never actually do. But this lady was not one of the liars, and she actually did tip me $5.\n\nI did a few more short rides after this before I ended up close to my house and called it quits.\n\nTwo trips on Uber for $22.95 and three trips on Lyft for $24.84, for a grand total of $47.79. I worked for three hours and four minutes, making a not-so-great $15.58 per hour.
