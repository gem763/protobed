USA TODAY\n\nIt's been a week of charity in the NBA.\n\nHarrison Barnes and his wife, Brittany, are helping cover the funeral costs for slain Dallas woman Atatiana Jefferson. Michael Jordan opened a $7 million health-care clinic to serve underprivileged communities in Charlotte. And Shaquille O'Neal donated a home to the family of a 12-year-old Atlanta boy paralyzed by a gunshot wound in August.\n\nIsaiah Payton was leaving a high school football game on Aug. 17 when a stray bullet struck his spine, leaving him without mobility from his chest down. He'd been unable to leave the hospital because his family's current home was not accessible for a paralyzed person.\n\nO'Neal heard about the story and reached out to Payton's mother.\n\n\"We found her a house,\" O'Neal told WXIA Atlanta. \"I\u2019m going to pay her rent for the year and I\u2019m going to give her some furniture and it\u2019s sad because her son is paralyzed from the chest down and no mother should have to go to that.\"\n\nHall of Fame basketball player Shaquille O'Neal smiles as he talks to reporters.

O'Neal's relationship with Papa John's helped him pull off the gesture; CEO Rob Lynch and chairman of the board Jeff Smith both chipped in.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to give her some furniture, TVs and pay her rent off for a year and help her get on her feet,\" O'Neal told WXIA.\n\nPayton's friend, Damean Spear, suffered a gunshot wound to his leg during the shooting. A 15-year-old boy, whose name is not being released, has been charged with aggravated assault in connection to the incident.\n\n\"This was a reckless, heartless and cowardly act of violence that forever changed the life of a 12-year-old child and his family and deeply affected another juvenile,\" Atlanta police chief Erika Shields said Thursday.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "description": "Shaquille O'Neal heard Isaiah Payton couldn't go home after he was paralyzed from the chest down.
