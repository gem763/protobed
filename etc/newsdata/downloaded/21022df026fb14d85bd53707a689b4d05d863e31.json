The alien language of parliamentary procedure \u2014 \u201cprorogation,\u201d \u201chumble addresses,\u201d \u201cpaving motions\u201d \u2014 is parsed for an unfamiliar public by constitutional experts who have rarely been in such demand.\n\nThe interviews with members of the public that dot the news vary from bafflement to outright loathing of politics; enthusiasm is a rare beast. According to Hansard Society research, civic trust is threadbare: Only a third of people trust politicians to act in the public interest, and just under half feel they have no influence at all on decision-making.\n\nBritain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union was always likely to be a vastly complex technical matter, and the bloc\u2019s tendency to conduct politics through intricate sequencing lends itself to squabbles over procedural minutiae. But the cause of the proliferating conflict in British politics has always been domestic: Despite losing her majority in 2017, Mrs. May\u2019s conduct of Brexit was distinguished by her autocratic instincts and determination to avoid parliamentary consultation.\n\nThe same highhanded conduct saw her first dragged to the Supreme Court to assert Parliament\u2019s right of a \u201cmeaningful vote,\u201d and then locked in a battle with Parliament over the disclosure of the attorney general\u2019s legal advice. That battle saw her censured for \u201ccontempt of Parliament.\u201d The phrase epitomizes her successor\u2019s entire attitude.\n\nOne consequence of the prominence of procedural conflicts since the Brexit referendum has been to transfer the political questions which drove it into arguments about legal permissibility. Questions about the kind of state the Britain wishes to be, relations among its constituent nations, its draconian attitudes to migrants, its vexed history in Ireland, how it makes domestic political choices and how far it wishes economic integration with other European states \u2014 all are folded into, and sometimes disappear in, conflicts over parliamentary rights and legal obligations.\n\nIt is then no wonder that apparently arid matters suddenly take on intense but displaced political energy \u2014 the kind that saw High Court judges branded \u201cenemies of the people\u201d on the front pages of the tabloid press and that turned usually pacific sections of society into ardent protesters.\n\nThe institutional confinement of the Brexit process has been seized on by Dominic Cummings, the former director of Vote Leave, now Mr. Johnson\u2019s chief adviser and architect of his hard-line strategy. Mr. Cummings recognizes a fault line in Britain\u2019s democratic structure: between an exercise conducted by plebiscite \u2014 the Brexit referendum \u2014 and the conventional, deliberative methods used to interpret and deliver the consequences of that vote.", "description": "The prime minister is effectively at war with the Parliament for which he once promised to \u201ctake back control.\u201d", "authors": ["James Butler"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/opinion/04butler/04butler-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg"}
