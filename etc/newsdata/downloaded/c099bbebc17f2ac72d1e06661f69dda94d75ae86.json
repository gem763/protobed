Working with [team boss Andrea] Adamo, Ott knows what he will get and where he sits.\"\n\nAsked if he had signed Tanak, Hyundai Motorsport director Andrea Adamo replied: \"No. I want to see how the situation is going on.\n\n\"I don't know if Ott has signed with someone. I am watching the movie and I love the movie. I see lots of actors playing in the movie who are much more clever than me and much more good than me.\n\n\"I'm the new kid on the block. I'm not able to fight at the same level as them.\"\n\nTanak to leave Toyota for Hyundai More\n\nWhile Tanak leads the championship in a Yaris WRC, he has suffered a variety of mechanical problems through the season.\n\nPower steering failure in Sardinia was arguably the most costly, with that failure on the Italian island costing him victory - a win that would have had him across the line and celebrating as a champion already.\n\nToyota team principal Tommi Makinen told Autosport: \"I don't have anything to say about this at all. We are still talking, still waiting [for Tanak].\"\n\nTanak's move would seal off Hyundai's team, with Neuville in the second full-time car and Dani Sordo and Sebastien Loeb rotating a third car. It has also fielded Andreas Mikkelsen and Craig Breen this season.\n\nWhere Tanak's exit leaves Toyota is another question.\n\nKalle Rovanpera is the only driver with a contract for next season, with Kris Meeke and Jari-Matti Latvala in 2020 negotiations at the moment.\n\nSome service park speculation has already begun that Sebastien Ogier could now jump ship from Citroen to drive his final season before retirement in a Toyota.\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "World Rally Championship leader Ott Tanak has signed for Hyundai and will drive alongside his current title rival Thierry Neuville in the 2020 season", "authors": ["David Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PB535.EnBLSIXPUj3Igi.w--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/f3b5436c9db82eec7bd6dbdc92527c71", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
