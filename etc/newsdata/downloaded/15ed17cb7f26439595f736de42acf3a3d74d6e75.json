Erasmus has suggested the Test arena is now so competitive that the era of the All Blacks potentially benefitting from marginal refereeing decisions as the best side in the world should theoretically be over.\n\nThe inconvenient truth that threatens All Blacks World Cup supremacy | Matt McIlraith Read more\n\nHaving named a starting XV with Beauden Barrett at full-back, Richie Mo\u2019unga at fly-half and the relatively inexperienced George Bridge and Sevu Reece on the wings, Hansen said Erasmus\u2019s comments were out of order. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious what they\u2019re trying to do,\u201d said Hansen, who will be stepping down as All Blacks coach after the tournament. \u201cWhilst I\u2019ve got a lot of respect for South Africa and particularly Rassie, I don\u2019t agree with what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s trying to put pressure on referees externally and they\u2019re under enough pressure already. They don\u2019t need us coaches doing what he\u2019s doing.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who your ref is. As a coach or a team, you can always find things after the game that they didn\u2019t deal with. You can get emotional about that and think that they\u2019re picking on you and not on the opposition. We\u2019ve done it ourselves. At the end of the day, referees try to do the best they can do. Yes, they don\u2019t always get it right all the time and we\u2019ve suffered from that just like other teams have. It\u2019s a big game, we just need to let the ref get on with it and prepare for it himself.\u201d\n\nHansen said he hoped Garc\u00e8s would be strong enough to block out such comments. \u201cAll I can say is I\u2019d hope so, yeah \u2026 they\u2019re not stupid people.\u201d He is keenly aware, however, that Garc\u00e8s was the same official who recently sent off his lock forward Scott Barrett against Australia in Perth, a decision which helped to accelerate a heavy loss for the All Blacks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rassie Erasmus suggested that the All Blacks have potentially benefitted from marginal refereeing decisions in the past.

World Cup winners Sonny Bill Williams and Ben Smith can only make the bench but Hansen argues that retaining a World Cup is increasingly a collective squad effort these days. \u201cIt\u2019s a marathon not a sprint and we want to have everyone available around the quarter-final stages,\u201d he said, brushing aside the statistic that no world champion side has ever lost a pool fixture en route.\n\n\u201cHistory is only history until you change it. In 2011 France were one point from changing it. If South Africa or ourselves get beaten this weekend you\u2019ve got a choice. You either roll over and say \u2018We can\u2019t win it now\u2019 or you say \u2018We\u2019ve just got to win every game from here on in\u2019. If you do that you win.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nThis will be the 99th Test between the two nations, with New Zealand having claimed 58 wins to South Africa\u2019s 36.
