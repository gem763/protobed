The decline in mortgage rates and continued short supply of homes has buoyed home-price growth in recent weeks. The total inventory of homes on the market has fallen 2.6% year-over-year to 1.86 million.\n\nSales increased substantially in the Northeast, rising 7.6% from July. Sales also edged upward in the Midwest (3.1%) and the South (0.9%). The West saw a slowdown in existing-home sales, with a 3.4% drop from the prior month. Median home prices have increased since August 2018 for every region except the Northeast.\n\nRead more: Home-building activity soars 12% to the fastest pace in more than a decade\n\nBig picture: Mortgage rates continue to be a rising tide for home sales across the country. Looking beyond August, mortgage-application data suggest that Americans may be looking to secure credit at the fastest pace since 2008 after accounting for seasonality, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson.\n\n\u201cThat, in turn, points to substantially higher home sales by the end of the year, provided would-be buyers\u2019 confidence is not hit too hard by the tariffs on consumer goods and the likely sharp slowdown in payroll growth,\u201d Shepherdson wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s a big if. Economic concerns have yet to weigh too heavily on consumer confidence up until now. But if Americans begin to see the effect of the trade war and global economic uncertainty hit their wallet, they may grow more cautious about taking the leap with such a big purchase as a home.\n\nOther headwinds persist for the housing market \u2014 namely the low supply of homes for sale continues to drive prices higher. Therefore, even a slight uptick in mortgage rates could cause many prospective buyers to be priced out of the market.\n\nAlso see: Home-builder confidence rises, despite growing concerns about the economy\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cWhile it may be a good time to lock in your 30-year fixed rate, the market is still starved for inventory and it\u2019s getting harder again for buyers to find the right home,\u201d Skylar Olsen, Zillow\u2019s ZG, -1.32% director of economic research, said in a report Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cIf current market conditions hold, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see home values continue to rise, but we could see a shift if consumer sentiment dips,\u201d he said.\n\nMarket reaction: The 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.68% moved lower in the wake of the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to trim interest rates.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.19% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.00% meanwhile were trending higher Thursday morning.", "description": "Sales volume remains elevated, but economic concerns may outweigh the bargain low rates offer.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI263_homeso_ZG_20190425114700.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
