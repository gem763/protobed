The bottom line is, Nancy Pelosi, as you just said, was not the only person shaken up coming out of there. We\u2019ve spoken to a Republican source who was in the room. I\u2019m told that they were alarmed at his demeanor. Quote, \u2018Everyone left completely shaken, shell shocked. He is not in control of himself. It is all yelling and screaming.'\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cAnd I asked the source, you know, who\u2019s been in many meetings with them, has it changed? Is it worse? Because every week we talk about, is it getting worse? The source said, \u2018100%.'\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI asked, are you worried about his stability? And the source said, \u2018yes.\u2019 The source went on to talk to other senior Republicans who were in the meeting. They were also shaken up. One used the word \u2018sickened.'\u201d\n\nShe concluded, \u201cThey got a sense of the Pentagon, the generals who were there, and they were very upset and the same thing. That this goes beyond just a policy difference. They were concerned about his demeanor. \u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Thursday's broadcast of CNN's \"Newsroom,\" special correspondent Jamie Gangel\u00a0said one of her Republican sources told her President Donald Trump's behavior shook many Republican lawmakers at a White House meeting on Wednesday. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/epo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
