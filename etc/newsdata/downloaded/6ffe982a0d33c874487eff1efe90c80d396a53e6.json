Alex (left) is oblivious as he too is taking a nap in the passenger seat\n\nInitially, Alex believes his father and also starts cursing. But the whole journey was captured on the vehicle's dashboard and exposed David's nap.\n\nAlex said: 'Driving to North Carolina from South Dakota for a family vacation, I drove through the night and had my dad take over driving. Not an hour later, this video happens.'\n\nHe later shared the August 24 footage online, but while some people saw the funny side, others slammed the 'irresponsible' driver for taking to the road in such a tired state.\n\nOne aghast viewer called Jason wrote: 'This is how people die. Someone veers off the road because they are too tired to drive and hit another car head-on and kill everyone.\n\n'Driving is serious. You are driving a 2-ton death machine. Start acting like it!'\n\nAlex's three-minute clip shared online shows the pair driving along a busy tree-lined highway during the day.\n\nThe pair awake with a start as the car smacks into the kerb, raising the right side of the car. David screams: 'God dammit!'\n\nDavid, who is not wearing a seat-belt, is at the wheel of the car while Alex is fast asleep reclined in the passenger seat.\n\nAlthough the radio is blaring out, the elderly driver becomes overwhelmed by a spate of yawning and appears quite bleary eyed.\n\nHe fights to remain awake, breathing in through his mouth and flicking his head as if to shake off his exhaustion.\n\nBut his eyelids slowly begin to close over and his head gently droops forward.\n\nAbout five seconds pass before there is a sudden sharp humming sound and the right side of the car lifts upwards as it mounts the curb.\n\nAlex asks, 'what are you doing?' and his father yells: 'That guy pushed me in the damn road!'\n\nAlex urges David to 'get off' the road, to which David retorts: 'I'm ok. The guy came in that white car and hit me. Son of a b****!'\n\nBoth father and son quickly open their eyes and David screams 'God dammit!' and brings the vehicle back under control.\n\nAlex asks, 'what are you doing?' and his father yells: 'That guy pushed me in the damn road!'\n\nBut Alex urges David to 'get off' the road, to which David retorts: 'I'm ok. The guy came in that white car and hit me... almost. Son of a b****!'\n\nOne shocked viewer commented: 'He wouldn't even have realized that he shut his eyes for even a moment. This is why you don't drive when you're exhausted!'\n\nWhile another said: 'Keep in mind as you drive, you share the road with people all around you just like this...every time you go out.'", "description": "David Mills was motoring along the highway in Nashville, Tennessee, when he gave into relentless yawning and drifted off, sending his car smacking into the curb.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/11/19486378-0-image-a-14_1570617783687.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
