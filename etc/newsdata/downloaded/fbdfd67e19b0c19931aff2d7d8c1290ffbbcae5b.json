They are virtuous, moral, and our betters in every way and they want you to know it all times. The latest example of this involves \u201ccancel culture,\u201d which is the act of using someone\u2019s past statements against them in order to get them fired, punished in some way, or ostracized from polite society.\n\nThe left have pioneered its use for years with no mercy. For the most part, Republicans have sat on the sidelines sneering. It hasn\u2019t worked at all. Instead, the left have only build up their offensive inventory more, with outfits like Media Matters and CNN\u2019s KFile constantly looking for anyone on the right to destroy.\n\nThat has led many conservatives to decide that holding the left to their own standards is not only the best way to push back, but the most just way to handle the situation.\n\nOf course, then you get stuff like this.\n\nEven more transparent when it's coming from the vice-signaling, civil war fetishist gang. They just really, really want to be good people! The libs won't let them! \u2014 Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) September 7, 2019\n\nThis is absolute nonsense and it\u2019s typical of the kind of snark and venom directed at fellow Republicans by some of the conservative \u201csmart set.\u201d They rarely muster such energy when going after the left though, as you\u2019re more likely to find them exchanging sarcastic, cutesy quips with liberals on Twitter in order to appear \u201cabove the fray.\u201d They\u2019ll savage you if you cross their line on an issue but are always respectful to whatever Vox reporter or CNN personality they are interacting with.\n\nLogically, there is nothing immature about holding your opponent to the same standards they apply to you, especially when those standards themselves are not objectively immoral. You may not like it when the right exposes the bad behavior of someone on the left, but that\u2019s not immoral. It was not immoral when Breitbart exposed a college professor for racist views, including saying white people couldn\u2019t have opinions. Why should a school be expected to keep someone like that when he has to interact with students of all races?\n\nYet, some Republicans rushed to his aid. That\u2019s the entire catalyst for the above tweet and the story written by Robby Soave at Reason. They simply don\u2019t want you fighting back, instead preferring to sit on the sidelines and keep signaling their virtue. That\u2019d be fine if what they were signaling was actually virtuous but politics is not religion and shouldn\u2019t be treated as such. Morality is one thing. Disagreements on tactics are another and it\u2019s perfectly legitimate to use the left\u2019s own attacks against them.\n\nThe bigger problem though is that these same conservatives who scold their own side constantly about cancel culture continue to offer no solutions of their own to the issue. Why are Republicans bound to let the left continue to beat their brains in with this? What \u201cprinciple\u201d dictates that exactly?\n\nJohn Ekdahl wrote a great response to all this.\n\nThe \"this is not who we are\" conservative clique needs to come up with a better solution to the cancel culture wars than unilateral surrender. \u2014 John Ekdahl (@JohnEkdahl) September 7, 2019\n\nBecause as it stands right now, CNN employs an entire team dedicated to scorched earth life-destroying tactics on anonymous reddit users. And you\u2019ve yet to offer a plausible solution to that beyond mild disagreement. \u2014 John Ekdahl (@JohnEkdahl) September 7, 2019\n\nAt the *absolute least* try torching the left for the virtual silence among their \u201cmainstream, respectable\u201d crew when this happens. But we rarely see even that. \u2014 John Ekdahl (@JohnEkdahl) September 7, 2019\n\nWhat these certain conservatives are demanding is for their own side to simply allow cancel culture to overtake them. The left are not going to stop just because enough Republicans get on Twitter and scold them. Things are only accelerating now and they are only going to stop when destruction is mutually assured. By Griswold\u2019s logic, Reagan should have gotten rid of all nuclear weapons to show the Soviets we are better than them. After all, it was really immature of him to build our weapons stockpiles, fighting fire with fire, when we could have just laid down our weapons and told the communists how bad they are. That would have been the mature, virtuous action, right? It also would have led to our destruction.\n\nIf Griswold, Soave, etc. want to keep slamming their political allies, perhaps it\u2019s time they offer some viable solutions other than losing gracefully. There\u2019s a serious rift on the right and I\u2019m not sure Trump leaving the national stage sometime in the future is going to fix it. Too much has been said, too many bridges have been burned. The vast majority do not want to go back to getting beat with the Mitt Romneys of the world. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone now has to be like Trump, as he\u2019s certainly got flaws, but they will have to be willing to go after the left with vigor.\n\nThat\u2019s a base requirement at this point and a select group of conservatives seem to be repulsed by even the most basic push back toward the progressive movement. They can either start figuring out ways to win within whatever behavioral worldview they hold or they can continue to go extinct as a political force. What they can\u2019t continue to do is bash fellow conservatives for reacting reasonably while giving no alternatives of their own. That\u2019s a quick path to irrelevancy outside of the bubble they currently inhabit.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
