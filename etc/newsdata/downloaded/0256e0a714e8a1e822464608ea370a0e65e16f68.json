Mitt Romney, R-Utah, on Thursday slammed President Trump for withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria and called the cease-fire between Turkey and Kurdish-led forces \"far from a victory.\"\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor after Vice President Mike Pence's announcement of a five-day cease-fire, Romney said: \u201cserious questions remain about how the decision was reached precipitously to withdraw from Syria and why that decision was reached.\u201d\n\nThe cease-fire, announced after Pence\u2019s meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Ankara, agrees to halt Turkey\u2019s offensive in Syria for five days so that Kurdish YPG forces can pull back from the roughly 20-mile safe zone on the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\nAll Turkish military operations will pause during that time, and the offensive \u2013 known as \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d \u2013 will halt entirely upon the completion of the Kurdish withdrawal, under the terms of the deal.\n\nThe cease-fire was heralded by President Trump as a \u201cgreat day for civilization.\u201d But that didn\u2019t change the fact, argued Romney, that the U.S. has \u201cabandoned\u201d the Kurds.\n\n\"Adding insult to dishonor, the administration speaks cavalierly, even flippantly, even as our ally has suffered death and casualty,\" Romney said. \"We once abandoned a red line. Now we abandon an ally.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred duties. It strikes at American honor. What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nTurkey invaded northeast Syria shortly after U.S. troops withdrew from the area. Trump\u2019s abrupt decision has sparked international bipartisan condemnation, with lawmakers arguing the decision would lead to a resurgence of ISIS and put the Kurds \u2013 who helped the U.S. fight the terror group \u2013 in danger.\n\nMITT ROMNEY BLASTS TRUMP\u2019S \u2018BRAZEN\u2019 REQUEST FOR FOREIGN PROBES INTO BIDEN FAMILY\n\nDespite the criticism, Trump has remained steadfast, saying Thursday that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria \u201cis between Turkey and Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our problem,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cThe Kurds know how to fight. As I said, they are not angels.\u201d\n\nTrump added: \u201cWe are not a policing agent\u2026It is time for us to go home.\u201d\n\nRomney said during his speech he wants the Trump administration to testify before Congress next week to explain its decision.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe also said the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations -- of which he is a member -- was not consulted before Trump\u2019s decision.\n\n\"I might be forgiven for wondering why our committee even exists,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Sen.
