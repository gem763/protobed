Eye experts create gripping visual processing test challenging users", "language": "en", "text": "A gripping quiz is challenging internet users to find out how quickly their brain processes information received from their eyes - and only one per cent of those tested get everything right.\n\nBritish online contact lens retailer Lenstore has set the challenge featuring a series of pictures of shapes, such as hexagons and triangles.\n\nPuzzlers then have to decipher how many shapes are contained within the outline.\n\nAfter 1,000 people tried the test, experts found that their ability to process visual information declines with age. While 18 to 24-year-olds scored highest, averaging 40 per cent, those aged between 55 and 64 years old got the lowest score, with just 27 per cent correct.\n\nScroll down for reveal\n\nHOW MANY TRIANGLES CAN YOU SEE?\n\n16, 29, 17 or 27\n\nHow many triangles can you see in this image: 16, 29, 17 or 27?\n\nInternet users were asked to find hidden triangles in this shape, left, and hidden quadrilaterals in this shape, right\n\nThe quiz gives you shapes with lines through the middle, before asking how many of a particular hidden shape there are inside it.\n\nAfter choosing from one of four answers, people seeking a challenge are then told if they got it correct, before being shown where the shapes are.\n\nExperts at Lenstore said that isolating and understanding shapes is linked to our visual processing speed, and therefore 'the amount of time needed to make a correct judgement about a visual stimulus'.\n\nResults from the test show that the ability to spot hidden shapes declines with age.\n\nWhile 18 to 24-year-olds led the pack, it then gradually declined from the age of 25 up to 64, before remaining steady over the age of 65.\n\nInternet users trying out the quiz were also asked to find all the hidden hexagons in this shape\n\nQuiz takers were also asked to work out how many triangles they could see hidden in both of these shapes\n\nInternet users were asked to spot the hidden triangles in both of these shapes\n\nQuiz takers were asked to find all the triangles hidden in this shape\n\nThey also found that men had a slightly better score than women, averaging 33 per cent compared to women's 31 per cent.\n\nOlder adults commonly say they have difficulties with visual tasks that involve clutter, other demands or the need to respond within a certain time period, according to a 2012 review published by journal Vision Research.\n\nIt says that these are often linked to poorer vision, which could be improved through training exercises.\n\nThe article was based on study's, including one that involved more than 2,000 older adults.\n\nBrainteaser challenges puzzlers to pick out the 11 clues that the residents of this house have gone on holiday (pictured)\n\nAnother mind-bending puzzle swept the internet lately - but can you beat the clock, or will you be left scratching your head?\n\nAt first glance, this seemingly typical suburban home doesn't appear any different to how it would normally look.\n\nBut if you scan the image more carefully, you should be able to pick out the 11 clues which indicate the residents might be spending time away.\n\nWith three fifths of domestic burglaries in the UK taking place between 6pm and 6am, according to ONS figures, the puzzle, created by Philips Hue smart lighting, aims to highlight the best ways to keep your home secure as evenings grow darker.\n\nIf you've given up, you can find the 11 hidden security risks highlighted in red (pictured)\n\nAndy Baxter, Philips Hue product manager at Signify said: 'A burglar will look at a row of houses in a street and look for the obvious signs that someone is away and it's easy to get into.\n\n'People can often get complacent when they live on a quiet road with a community fee - leaving windows open or letting post pile up in sight through the porch window - so it's worth coming up with some tactics to protect your home from thieves.'\n\nAnswers to the puzzle: Light left on throughout the night; door is unlocked; valuable items seen through the window; rubbish; a key under a doormat.\n\nOther answers include: Having an alarm system in line of sight; curtains left half open; post piled up in the letterbox; ladder in the garden; window open; no car in driveway.\n\nDon't worry if you didn't manage to beat the two minute record, as there have been plenty of other brainteasers sweeping the web for you to try your hand at.\n\nThe latest brainteaser, created by toy manufacturer TOMY, asks people to find the musical note in the space landing scene (pictured)\n\nAnother brainteaser which has proved challenging to even the most eagle-eyed of netizens asks people to find a musical note in a space landing scene - so give it a go, and reach for the stars!\n\nThe colourful graphic was designed to celebrate the launch of Rizmo by TOMY, the first ever 'evolving toy' that listens, learns, remembers and grows - both in play value and physical form.\n\nIn an ideal world, you would have found the answer by now, but if you're after a clue then look towards the right-hand side of the image.\n\nAnd if you're still struggling, you'll find the hidden musical note resides towards the bottom of the puzzle.", "description": "Eye experts at online contact lens retailer Lenstore have created a gripping visual processing quiz, challenging internet users to find hidden triangles, hexagons and quadrilaterals in shapes.", "authors": ["Luke Andrews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/15/19792532-0-image-a-144_1571237039487.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
