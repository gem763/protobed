Mary Tyson, the mother of Pastor Clifford Tyson, adjusts his shirt collar outside her home in Tampa\n\nBy Linda So\n\nTAMPA, Florida (Reuters) - Clifford Tyson wants to help choose America\u2019s next president. But the Florida resident fears his vote might return him to jail.\n\nTyson, 63, owes court-ordered fines and fees for three felony convictions, one for robbery, two for theft, all decades old. Under a Florida law that went into effect July 1, he must pay those penalties before casting a ballot or risk being prosecuted for voter fraud.\n\nTyson searched court records, first on his own, then with the help of a nonprofit legal advocacy group. They say that because Florida has no comprehensive system for tracking such fines, the documents don\u2019t make clear what he owes. The records, viewed by Reuters, show potential sums ranging from $846 to a couple thousand dollars related to crimes he committed in the late 1970s and 1990s. Tyson says he won\u2019t risk voting until Florida authorities can tell him for sure.\n\n\u201cUntil there is clarity, as much as I want to vote, I won\u2019t do it,\u201d Tyson said.\n\nThe Tampa pastor is now a plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the payments law, which was crafted by Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature and signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, also a Republican. The law came just months after Floridians approved a ballot initiative restoring voting rights to more than 1 million felons who have completed their sentences; that change to the state\u2019s Constitution created a potentially huge new crop of voters in a critical battleground state ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in June by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Brennan Center for Justice, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense and Educational Fund, alleges the fees requirement defies the will of Florida voters and amounts to an illegal poll tax on newly enfranchised Florida felons, many of them minorities.\n\nBut another argument is shaping up to be central to the plaintiffs\u2019 case: Florida has no consolidated system for determining what felons owe or certifying that they have paid up. It\u2019s a situation that ex-offenders say makes it virtually impossible for them to prove they are eligible to vote.\n\nThose claims are bolstered by state election officials who say they can\u2019t calculate what felons owe, either, according to a Reuters review of 7 depositions, emails and other internal correspondence from voting administrators submitted by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys as part of the lawsuit.\n\nFlorida has no centralized database where records of court-ordered fines and fees - and any payments of those penalties - are stored, election and court officials say. To get that information, felons typically must search documents in courts where they were convicted, be they federal or state, inside or outside Florida. Records have been found to be incomplete, contradictory or missing, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys say.\n\nWith the Feb. 18 deadline to register for the state\u2019s 2020 presidential primary approaching, the issue is taking on urgency. An estimated 436,000 felons have fees to settle before they can vote, according to a study by University of Florida political scientist Daniel Smith, an expert witness for the ACLU. The study was based on court data and Department of Corrections records.\n\nThe stakes are high. Florida commands 29 of the 538 electoral votes that are used under the U.S. Electoral College system to select the American president. In Florida and most other states, the candidate who places first in the popular vote \u2013 even if just by a hair \u2013 wins all the electoral votes. Florida has a history of tight elections and contested outcomes.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys say Florida has shifted all responsibility for compliance with the new payments law to ex-offenders, who risk prosecution if they get it wrong. The state contends the legislature merely implemented the constitutional amendment as it was written on the ballot.\n\nThe legislation, known as SB 7066, \u201csows seeds of confusion,\u201d said Leah Aden, deputy director of litigation at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. \u201cIt will chill participation.\u201d\n\nSome of the state\u2019s 67 county elections supervisors - the public servants who ultimately decide which felons get culled from the rolls and which can stay - expressed concern in their depositions and to Reuters about making mistakes that could invite challenges to future election results.\n\nFive testified recently in the lawsuit that they lack the manpower to do detailed searches or have no way of ascertaining for certain whether ex-offenders have met their financial obligations under SB 7066.\n\nThey said they are relying on Florida\u2019s Department of State, which manages the state\u2019s elections, to help them determine who is ineligible. That agency is developing a procedure to send counties regularly updated lists of felons on their rolls who have unpaid fines and fees, but it has no timetable as to when it will be ready, said Maria Matthews, the director of the Department of State\u2019s Division of Elections, in a September deposition. Matthews did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nFor now, the agency is providing counties only with names of Florida felons who are incarcerated, and thus ineligible to vote, Toshia Brown, chief of the department\u2019s Voter Registration Services, said in an August deposition. Brown did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nAn early list sent to Leon County in Florida\u2019s Panhandle region appeared to contain inaccuracies, Deputy Elections Supervisor Christopher Moore said in a July email to his staff, which was viewed by Reuters. Moore's office researched a June list provided by the Department of State containing 66 names of allegedly incarcerated felons, but could not determine whether felony convictions existed for 24 of them \u2013 36% of the total - emails exchanged between Moore and his staff show.\n\n\u201cThis process is not off to a very accurate start and we are playing with people\u2019s eligibility to vote,\u201d Moore said in the July email. Moore told Reuters that subsequent data his office has received from the Department of State has gotten better.\n\nSarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the Department of State reviews information from a variety of sources, makes an initial determination on a voter\u2019s eligibility, then passes that along to county supervisors. She said the agency is working to \u201cimprove the accuracy and efficiency of the information,\u201d but said it\u2019s up to those elections supervisors to make the final call.\n\nSome backers of the payments law say the responsibility should be on ex-offenders, not the state, to figure out how to comply with SB 7066.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to register to vote and you\u2019re a former felon, it\u2019s worth double checking to make sure you took care of everything,\u201d said J.C. Martin, chairman of the Polk County Republican Party in central Florida.\n\nA federal judge in the Northern District of Florida has set a Monday hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction to throw out the fees requirement. A decision could come as early as this month.\n\nNO CENTRALIZED DATABASE\n\nFlorida stripped felons of their votes during the Jim Crow era in 1868, a ban that endured 150 years and disproportionately affected black voters. As recently as 2016, more than 1.4 million people with felony convictions were barred from voting in Florida, including one in five African American adults, according to The Sentencing Project, a criminal justice nonprofit, which used state conviction and incarceration records for the study.\n\nIn November 2018, nearly 65% of Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment restoring voting rights to felons, except those convicted of murder and sex crimes.\n\nThrough the end of July, Florida recorded around 337,000 new voter registrations, 45,000 of them by African Americans. That\u2019s a 22% increase in new black voters compared to the same period in 2015, the year preceding the last presidential election, a Reuters analysis of Florida voting data shows.\n\nThe ballot initiative said felons must first complete \u201call terms of their sentence including parole or probation.\u201d Republican lawmakers interpreted that to include any court costs, fines, fees and restitution to victims imposed at sentencing. In May, they passed a bill requiring repayment as a condition for voting.\n\nDeSantis, the governor, signed it into law in June amid criticism by voting rights advocates that the legislation was intended to suppress potential votes of African Americans, who tend to vote Democratic. DeSantis has dismissed claims that the law is a poll tax.\n\nThe state is still discussing ways to centralize data to track payments. Building a consolidated system could take years and cost millions, according to lawmakers and officials who debated the issue before the law\u2019s passage.\n\n\u201cRight now, the system is just a mess,\u201d ACLU attorney Julie Ebenstein said.\n\nSean Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center said the group spent weeks trying to track down what Tyson owes, but couldn\u2019t get a clear answer.\n\nFor example, Tyson has a 1998 theft conviction in Hillsborough County on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. A judgment order on the clerk\u2019s online docket shows he was ordered to pay $661 in costs, fines and fees. But a separate subpage on the website indicates he was ordered to pay $1,066. Still another shows a total of $573. Tyson\u2019s lawyers say no officials have been able to explain the discrepancies.\n\nState Representative Jamie Grant of Tampa, a Republican supporter of SB 7066, said critics of the law are the ones trying to defy the will of the electorate.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to change what the definition and terms are after people vote for it,\u201d Grant said.", "description": "Restoring felon voting rights a 'mess' in battleground Florida", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF960PU_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
