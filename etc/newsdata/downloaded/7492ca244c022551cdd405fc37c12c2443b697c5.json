Now he may have harnessed the power of the presidency to gain political advantage.\n\nThis is bombshell layered upon bombshell. On top of the initial accusation by the whistle-blower is the refusal of the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, to obey federal law and relay the matter to Congress within one week.\n\nThe law is very clear, but it\u2019s also true that Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both suggested that there might be situations involving classified information where a president should not follow the statute. These are very tricky questions of executive power versus congressional oversight.\n\nJeffrey Smith, who was the C.I.A.\u2019s general counsel under Clinton, told me that despite the technical legal arguments, there should still be ways to allow oversight, especially if the core issue is a commitment that the president has made to a foreign power.\n\nSmith cited a time when he was at the C.I.A. and a matter came up that did not technically require reporting to Congress but still raised troubling questions. After some soul-searching within the agency, it provided a briefing to the \u201cgang of eight\u201d congressional leaders, and Smith told me that the same would be appropriate today.\n\nLook, this whistle-blower\u2019s complaint will leak. The Trump administration\u2019s recalcitrance will simply make it all the more newsworthy.\n\nWhen historians review Trump\u2019s term, I think they will see combat between an out-of-control president and various U.S. institutions, such as the courts, the Civil Service, law enforcement, the intelligence community, the House and the news media, which generally have done a credible job of standing up for laws and norms and against one-man rule. The only institution Trump has co-opted completely is the Republican Party in Congress.", "description": "Many elements are murky, but something clearly stinks.", "authors": ["Nicholas Kristof"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/opinion/22kristof/22kristof-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
