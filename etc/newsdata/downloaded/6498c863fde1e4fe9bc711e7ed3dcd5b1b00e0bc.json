Almost three quarters of Aramco's oil goes to Asia.\n\nPrevious events of a similar nature in recent times, however, have not had a long-term effect on the oil price.\n\nAs international energy policy expert Professor Nick Butler explains, \"the direct impact of the attacks could be short-lived. The market has adjusted without blinking over the last two years to the loss for political reasons of over two millions barrels a day of production from Venezuela and Iran\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Abqaiq is the site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant\n\nRegional risk\n\nThe worry is, if the attacks stoke broader tensions in the region, then these price rises could be more long-term.\n\nProfessor Butler believes \"if retaliation becomes a reality, any spike could be sustained feeding the risk of an economic recession\".\n\nFor Helima Croft, Global Head of Commodity Strategy at the Royal Bank of Canada, these drone attacks are \"a game changer in the escalating Iranian regional stand-off\".\n\nProduction facilities, trading routes and pipelines which thread through the region could all be vulnerable to future attacks.\n\nConsumer impact\n\nIt is far too early to tell whether consumers will see any financial impact from a rising oil price.\n\nIn the short term, much depends on how long a spike lasts - and any rise would take weeks to feed through into petrol prices.\n\nFor now, investors are closely watching for more statements from Aramco and for any political reaction to events.\n\nIn the UK, 40% of the price of a litre of petrol is made up of oil, fuel production and profit. The rest is tax. Analysts they do not expect to see a significant rise in prices at the pumps for drivers.\n\n\"There are currently savings in the wholesale price that have only just started to be passed on to drivers by retailers,\" says industry expert Simon Williams from automotive services company RAC Limited.\n\n\"Many retailers cut their prices by three pence on Friday and we believe that average prices were six pence too high before that, so the impact of these fires may not be too great.\"", "description": "The BBC's Katie Prescott assesses whether drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities could affect consumers.", "authors": ["Katie Prescott", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0367/production/_108817800_gettyimages-601041062-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
