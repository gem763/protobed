(AP) - Cannabis is knocking at the NFL\u2019s door, but it can\u2019t get in.\n\nNot yet, at least.\n\nThe home of the New England Patriots has a new sponsorship deal that will put a cannabidiol company\u2019s hemp leaf logo on a water tower looming over the stadium and on a sign overlooking an entrance.\n\nFormer Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski was on hand to announce the deal with Gillette Stadium and Patriot Place, a mall also controlled by Patriots owner Robert Kraft, that brings the banned substance to the doorstep of the NFL without violating league policies against it.\n\n\u201cWe are not allowed to be within the stadium itself,\u201d said Perry Antelman, the CEO of Rhode Island-based Abacus Health Products. \u201cThis is up to the NFL. I know that they are working with and studying alternative medications to help the athletes.\u201d\n\nThe NFL drug policy, which is negotiated with the players\u2019 union, bans teams and active players from sponsorship deals with cannabinoids, which include marijuana but also hemp-based products like CBD that don\u2019t include the high-inducing THC. The league tests for THC and advises players not to take CBD products because they might contain it.\n\nBut as states begin to lift or loosen their prohibitions on marijuana, major sports leagues are reconsidering their bans on therapeutic and even recreational cannabis use. An NFL committee formed in May is hoping to establish policies on the use of prescription medication and on pain management, including alternative therapies that could free players to use CBD.\n\n\u201cWe hear that it is coming around. Whether that\u2019s six months, nine months, 12 months or 18 months, we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Antelman said. \u201cWhen it does come around, we\u2019re hoping that will be one of the first to be in the stadium.\u201d\n\nGronkowski, who retired last spring at 29, is free to endorse the product, CBDMEDIC. But unless the rules change he could not make a much-rumored comeback without severing ties with the company.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be banned from playing the sport I love because I\u2019m using a product that I can buy, or anyone can buy, at their local pharmacy right off the shelf. It\u2019s that simple. I also want to have the option to get back into the game and if I\u2019m banned next year, I can\u2019t,\u201d he said, reading off a teleprompter before going off script and pointing at members of the audience. \u201cYou know you want to see me out there. \u2026 I know you do.\u201d\n\nAlthough he was known as a partyer in his playing days, Gronkowski insisted he was coming out only for CBD and not recreational drug use, and because he thinks it could have helped him endure the pain of an NFL season. He recounted some of his operations and other injuries, down to the opposing player and the spot on his body that ached afterward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not advocating for marijuana but for CBD. And not for partying, but for recovering,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou know me, a little party in there.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cannabis is knocking at the NFL's door, but it can't get in.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jimmy Golen"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
