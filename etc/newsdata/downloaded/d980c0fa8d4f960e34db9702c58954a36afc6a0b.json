(Julio Cortez/Associated Press)\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 It didn\u2019t matter to Austin Hays that the game he was in had absolutely no bearing on the playoff picture.\n\nThat was the last thing on his mind as he chased after a soaring line drive that appeared destined to go over the wall.\n\nThe Orioles rookie made a highlight-reel grab, one that will be played over and over long after anyone remembers that the Toronto Blue Jays beat Baltimore 8-4 Thursday night.\n\nCavan Biggio and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. homered for the Blue Jays, who scored 27 runs in their first three-game sweep at Camden Yards since July 2010.\n\nHays\u2019 catch \u2014 and his enthusiasm in making it \u2014 belied the unimportance of a matchup between two teams that long ago dropped out of contention in the AL East.\n\nAfter Biggio and Gurriel homered off Gabriel Ynoa (1-9) within a span of three pitches in the fourth inning, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. sent a deep drive to center.\n\n\u201cOnce I got closer to the wall, I realized there was a chance that I was going to jump for it,\u201d Hays said.\n\nHays raced to the warning track, leaped to reach over the 7-foot wall and snagged the ball in the middle of his glove.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the catch you dream about playing in the backyard, playing Wiffle ball and all that, so that was pretty cool,\u201d Hays said. \u201cThat might be the first time since I was in high school that I robbed a home run. Definitely a cool experience.\u201d\n\nUpon returning to the ground, Hays pounded his chest three times in succession and yelled with delight.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just raw emotion,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to do something like that every day.\u201d\n\nRealizing the ball didn\u2019t make it out, Guerrero showed his appreciation for the play by taking off his helmet and waving it in Hays\u2019 direction.\n\nHays, chomping hard on his gum, lifted his cap over his head and pumped it up and down twice as a way of thanking Guerrero.\n\nToronto manager Charlie Montoyo wanted the home run, but that didn\u2019t lessen his recognition of a job well done.\n\n\u201cThat was an outstanding play by Hays,\u201d Montoyo said. \u201cThat would have been cool to watch, three (homers) in a row.\u201d\n\nThe night became even more memorable for Hays in the eighth, when he hit his second big league home run. The first came during his previous stint with the Orioles in 2017.\n\nThough denied by Hays earlier, Guerrero hit a two-run double in the pivotal six-run seventh inning after Biggio singled in a pair of runs.\n\nAnthony Kay (1-0) earned his first major league victory by pitching four innings in relief of opener Wilmer Font. Afterward, Kay received what he called a \u201cbeer shower\u201d from his teammates.\n\nTrey Mancini had four hits for the Orioles, who have lost four straight and 15 of 19.\n\nFUTURE STARS?\n\nRyan Mountcastle has been named Baltimore\u2019s top minor league player for 2019.\n\nMountcastle played first base, third base and left field for Triple-A Norfolk. A 2015 first-round pick, the 22-year-old hit .312 with 35 doubles, 25 homers and 83 RBIs as MVP of the International League.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing what he looks like next spring,\u201d manager Brandon Hyde said.\n\nRight-handers Mike Baumann and Grayson Rodriguez were named the club\u2019s top minor league pitchers.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBlue Jays: SS Bo Bichette was removed for concussion protocol a couple innings after being struck in the left side of his batting helmet by a sixth-inning pitch from Ynoa. ... Guerrero was obviously feeling chipper after leaving Wednesday\u2019s game with an apparent rib injury. \u201cJust a little contusion on his side but he\u2019s fine,\u201d Montoyo said. ... Gurriel is still recovering from a left quad strain that put him on the IL for more than a month. \u201cHe\u2019s not 100 percent, so I think that\u2019s big for him to learn how to play that way,\u201d Montoyo said.\n\nOrioles: RHP Hunter Harvey was shut down for the season on Wednesday with soreness in his biceps. He made a positive impression in seven games as a reliever with the Orioles, going 1-0 with a 1.42 ERA. \u201cHe looked great in that late-inning role,\u201d Hyde said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlue Jays: Toronto continues a 22-game stretch against AL East foes at Yankee Stadium on Friday night in the opener a three-game set.\n\nOrioles: Reliever Richard Bleier (3-0, 5.63 ERA) starts off a bullpen game for Baltimore on Friday night against Seattle for the final series of the year at Camden Yards.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
