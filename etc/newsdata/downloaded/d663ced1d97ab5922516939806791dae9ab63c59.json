I have only just arrived and it always takes a time to adapt,' Griezmann said.\n\nAntoine Griezmann put Barcelona ahead after latching onto Clement Lenglet's long ball\n\nIt was Griezmann's fourth league goal of the season despite an unsettled start to life at Barca\n\nBarcelona did eventually make it two after Lionel Messi finished off a brilliant team move\n\nLuis Suarez added a third after being presented with a tap-in by Messi who ran clean through\n\nSuarez's fifth league goal this season put him back ahead as Barcelona's top scorer this season\n\nMATCH FACTS Eibar: Dmitrovic, de Blasis, Oliveira, Arbilla, Cote, Pedro Leon (Exposito 63'), Diop, Sergio Alvarez, Orellana, Charles (Kike Garcia 79'), Sergi Enrich (Inui 71') Subs not used: Bigas, Quique Gonzalez, Yoel, Tejero Booked: Alvarez, Diop, Charles, Exposito, Inui Barcelona: Ter Stegen, S. Roberto (Semedo 45'), Umtiti, Lenglet, Alba, de Jong (Rakitic 79'), Busquets, Arthur (Vidal 71'), Messi, Suarez, Griezmann Subs not used: Neto, Todibo, Carles Perez, Ansu Fati Goalscorers: Griezmann 13, Messi 58, Suarez 66\n\nThere have been so many doubts over his ability to find his place in this team alongside Messi but this performance suggested they can emulate the unstoppable trio formed by Messi, Suarez and Neymar.\n\nBarcelona went route one for the opener with Clement Lenglet lofting the ball over the top of the Eibar defence for Griezmann to run on to.\n\nHelped by the fact that Pablo De Blasis had slipped, Griezmann raced away and buried his shot in off the near post and past Marko Dimitrovic.\n\nThere were early signs that the Frenchman who had only previously played 187 minutes so far this season with Messi and Suarez was on their wavelength even if the first goal had more to do with Lenglet's vision.\n\n'We knew that they pushed high up the pitch so I said to Clement if he could pick me out with a long ball then he should do it,' he said of his French team-mate's pass.\n\nGriezmann was also involved in the other two goals in an excellent all-round display\n\nLionel Messi and Barcelona had two appeals for a penalty turned down in the first half\n\nMessi also wasted a glorious chance to add a second goal before the break\n\nSamuel Umtiti (top) returned to the Barcelona lineup after a six weeks out with a foot injury\n\nLuis Suarez had an effort ruled out for offside early in the second half after a slick move\n\nMessi was also enjoying himself twice dancing through the heart of the Eibar defence and denied only by an outstretched hand from Dimitrovic. Suarez tried his luck from the halfway line but sent the audacious effort wide.\n\nMessi, Suarez and Griezmann all got a touch for the second goal turned in by the Argentinian. And their prints were also on the third which was the pick of the three goals scored.\n\nGriezmann received the ball on the halfway line and sent Messi clear with a pass. The flag stayed down and he rolled the ball to Suarez who had the easiest of tap-ins.\n\nThe win even meant Barcelona moved top ahead of Real Madrid's game at Mallorca.\n\nMore pleasing for coach Ernesto Valverde will be the return of fit again Samuel Umtiti. That and the apparent lift-off for his front three.", "description": "PETE JENSON IN SPAIN: Goals from Antoine Griezmann, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez put Barcelona at the top of the La Liga table after a 3-0 victory at Eibar.", "authors": ["Pete Jenson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/14/19924044-0-image-a-36_1571490962123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
