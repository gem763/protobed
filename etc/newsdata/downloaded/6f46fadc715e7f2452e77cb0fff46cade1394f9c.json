He rose to fame after joining the cast of NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d while still a teenager in 1980, and later that decade he put out two of the most acclaimed stand-up comedy specials ever released: \u201cDelirious\u201d in 1983 and \u201cRaw\u201d in 1987, the latter setting a box-office record that remains standing.\n\nThe comedian has remained active in Hollywood in the decades since \u201cRaw,\u201d but he has rarely performed stand-up during the 32 years since its release.\n\nHe recently announced plans to return to the stage, however, disclosing in interviews last month that he plans to release a comedy special and resume performing live.\n\nMr. Murphy is currently set to host \u201cSNL\u201d in December for the first time in 35 years. He inked a deal with Netflix to release special in 2020 and has a theater tour in the works, The New York Times reported last month.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
