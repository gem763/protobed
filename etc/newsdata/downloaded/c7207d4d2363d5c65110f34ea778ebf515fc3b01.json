It also didn\u2019t make the top 20, or even the top 30.\n\nThe 50 states actually dropped two spots to land at No. 36 on this year\u2019s list, and the rankings published by Forbes note that esteem for the U.S. has been \u201cin steep decline\u201d since 2016.\n\nThe Reputation Institute, a reputation measurement and management services firm, has studied attitudes toward countries since 2008. This time around, it surveyed more than 58,000 people from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. about the 55 countries with the greatest gross domestic product, as well as the nations that are familiar to at least 51% of the population of G8 countries. And the RI also mulled over to what extent each nation has an \u201cadvanced economy, an appealing environment and an effective government.\u201d\n\n\u201cReputation determines whether people support a country through their behaviors. Good reputation means more exports, more investments, more people coming to visit,\u201d the RI\u2019s Nicolas Georges Trad told Forbes.\n\nAnd Sweden took the top spot for the second year in a row, largely thanks to its universal healthcare system, eco-friendly policies and commitment to gender equality. But the Swedish Institute government agency has also been distributing \u201cSharing Sweden\u201d fact sheets and guides highlighting what the country is doing \u2014 like improving accessibility for people living with disabilities \u2014 to shape its perception overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder Sweden is No. 1, because it\u2019s done an incredible job of telling its story,\u201d said Stephen Hahn-Griffiths, chief reputation officer at RI.\n\nSweden was followed by Switzerland, Norway, Finland and New Zealand rounding out the top five.\n\nBut the U.S. and the U.K. have been sending the world mixed messages, Han-Griffiths said. The U.K. dropped two spots to No. 18 largely due to questions about its Parliament\u2019s competence as the Brexit deadline approaches.\n\nAnd the political polarization within the U.S., as well as the White House\u2019s increasingly nationalistic stance, has shaken the country\u2019s perception abroad. \u201cThe U.S. is at an ethical and moral crossroads,\u201d said Hahn-Griffiths. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to have an advanced economy \u2014 it\u2019s about what you\u2019re doing to help society progress in the right way.\u201d\n\nIraq was at the very bottom of the list, followed by Iran and Pakistan.\n\nThe Reputation Institute\u2019s 10 Most Reputable Countries for 2019 are:", "description": "Scandinavian nations top the best places in the Reputation Institute\u2019s rankings.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT418_Grungy_ZG_20191016113356.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
