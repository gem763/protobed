REUTERS/Luis Cortes\n\nThe abduction and apparent massacre of the youths by corrupt police working with a violent drug gang drew international outrage and led to widespread condemnation of the administration of Mexico\u2019s previous president, Enrique Pena Nieto.\n\nA person with knowledge of the matter said one place being searched is a garbage lot in Tepecoacuilco, a few miles from the southwestern city of Iguala in Guerrero state where the student teachers were abducted on the night of Sept. 26, 2014.\n\nA spokeswoman for the attorney general\u2019s office confirmed that new investigations were under way in Guerrero, but said she could not say exactly where they were taking place.\n\nGovernment officials said at a regular news conference on Thursday that people linked to the disappearances who had been freed from prison could be sent back.\n\nOfficials added they had conducted nine searches since June to find traces of the trainee teachers, and would call Jesus Murillo, the attorney general who oversaw the Pena Nieto-era probe into the disappearances, to make declarations next week.\n\nPena Nieto\u2019s successor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, took office in December pledging to re-open the case. His government has called the original probe into the crime \u201cdiscredited\u201d and vowed to go after the officials who led it. [nL2N26A020]\n\nAngela Buitrago, a consultant named by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights who is helping to oversee the new probe, said it was also important to investigate military officials who were present in Iguala five years ago.\n\nLopez Obrador said in December that military officials should also be put under the spotlight, but it is not clear what questions, if any, they have so far faced.\n\nAccording to the Pena Nieto administration\u2019s account, local drug gang Guerreros Unidos mistook the students for members of a rival outfit, killed them, incinerated their bodies in a nearby garbage dump and tipped their remains into a river.\n\nHowever, the remains of only one of the 43 was ever definitively identified, and a group of independent experts later picked several holes in the official version of events.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said in a report last year that it appeared Mexican authorities had tortured dozens of people during the investigation. Out of 142 suspects detained in the case, more than half have been released.
