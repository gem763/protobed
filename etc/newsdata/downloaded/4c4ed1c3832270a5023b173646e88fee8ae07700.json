Cooper appeared before impeachment investigators Wednesday during a closed-door session that was delayed by Republican lawmakers who burst into the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s secure suite to protest the inquiry.\n\nBelow is a copy of the letter Cooper received, obtained and annotated with context and analysis by The New York Times.\n\nDeputy Secretary of Defense\n\n1010 Defense Pentagon\n\nWashington, D.C. 20301-1010\n\nOct. 22, 2019\n\n(The date stamp shows that the deputy secretary of defense, David Norquist, sent this warning letter Tuesday, the day before Cooper was scheduled to give voluntary, private testimony. That same day, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, signed a subpoena stating that Cooper was legally required to appear.)\n\nDaniel Levin\n\nWhite & Case LLP\n\n701 13th Street, NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20005-3807\n\nDear Mr. Levin:\n\nI understand that you have been retained by Ms. Laura Cooper, the Department\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, as her private counsel for a deposition to be conducted jointly by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Oversight and Reform, \u201c[p]ursuant to the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\u201d The Department\u2019s October 15, 2019 letter to the Chairs of the three House Committees [Tab A] expressed its belief that the customary process of oversight and accommodation has historically served the interests of congressional oversight committees and the Department well. The Committees\u2019 purported \u201cimpeachment inquiry,\u201d however, presents at least two issues of great importance.\n\nThe first issue is the Committees\u2019 continued, blanket refusal to allow Department Counsel to be present at depositions of Department employees. Department Counsel\u2019s participation protects against the improper release of privileged or classified information, particularly material covered by the executive privilege which is the President\u2019s alone to assert and to waive. Excluding Department Counsel places the witness in the untenable position of having to decide whether to answer the Committees\u2019 questions or to assert Executive Branch confidentiality interests without an attorney from the Executive Branch present to advise on those interests.\n\nIt violates settled practice and may jeopardize future accommodation. Furthermore, the Department of Justice has concluded that \u201ccongressional subpoenas that purport to require agency employees to appear without agency counsel are legally invalid and are not subject to civil or criminal enforcement.\u201d See Attempted Exclusion of Agency Counsel from Congressional Depositions of Agency Employees, 43 Op. O.L.C. (May 23, 2019) [Tab B].\n\nThe second issue is the absence of authority for the Committees to conduct an impeachment inquiry. In its October 15, 2019 letter, the Department conveyed concerns about the Committees\u2019 lack of authority to initiate an impeachment inquiry given the absence of a delegation of such authority by House Rule or Resolution. This correspondence echoed an October 8, 2019 letter from the White House Counsel [Tab C] expressing the President\u2019s view that the inquiry was \u201ccontrary to the Constitution of the United States and all past bipartisan precedent\u201d and \u201cviolates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process.\u201d\n\nThis letter informs you and Ms. Cooper of the Administration-wide direction that Executive Branch personnel \u201ccannot participate in [the impeachment] inquiry under these circumstances\u201d [Tab C]. In the event that the Committees issue a subpoena to compel Ms. Cooper\u2019s appearance, you should be aware that the Supreme Court has held, in United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41 (1953), that a person cannot be sanctioned for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena unauthorized by House Rule or Resolution.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The White House has declared that the executive branch will not cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry, but some officials have nevertheless provided testimony to Congress about what they know about whether President Donald Trump's attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DWko.o9VXV3GujSpbwj_xA--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/857417c1fec1980f2d008604123a2fe8", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
