General Assembly amid a ratcheting up of tensions in the Middle East.\n\nTrump put the current Iran nuclear deal at risk when he pulled the U.S. out last year. Other nations have pledged to keep the pact going, but relations have been put under strain.\n\nThe issue came to a head earlier this month when Saudi Arabian oil facilities were attacked by drone strikes. The U.S. and U.K. have laid the blame on Tehran.\n\nSpeaking to NBC, Johnson said it was difficult to tell whether relations would have been better without the U.S. withdrawal \u201cbecause the reality is, as President Trump rightly said, it was a bad deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt had many defects. Iran was and is behaving disruptively in the region,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBut I think there\u2019s an opportunity now if everyone can de-escalate for us all \u2014 that\u2019s to say the Europeans, the U.K., plus the United States and others \u2014 to look at a successor to that deal. If it was a bad deal \u2014 and I\u2019m willing to accept that it had many, many defects \u2014 then let\u2019s do a better deal.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s one guy who can do a better deal and one guy who understands how to get a difficult partner like Iran over the line and that is the president of the United States.\n\n\u201cSo I hope that there will be a Trump deal, to be totally honest with you.\u201d\n\nA U.K. government spokesman said the prime minister \u201csupports\u201d the current Iran pact. But they added: \u201cThe Iranians aren't currently in compliance and we need to bring them back into compliance. If there's a way to do that we're open to discussing possible solutions.\u201d\n\nTrump welcomed the proposal by Johnson to negotiate a fresh deal, saying he was \u201cnot at all surprised that he was the first one to come out and say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's why he's a winner,\u201d the president told White House reporters. \u201cThat's why he's a man who\u2019s going to be successful in the U.K.\u201d\n\nTrump added that the existing Iran deal was set to too short a timeframe, and that it lacked sufficient inspection rights over Iranian development sites.\n\nOn Sunday night, Johnson left the door open to sending troops to Saudi Arabia to help defend its facilities. \u201cWe will consider in what way we could be useful if asked \u2014 depending on what the exact plan is,\u201d he told journalists on the plane to New York, adding the U.K. would consider any requests for help from Saudi Arabia and the U.S.\n\nJohnson is set to hold talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday, on the fringes of the U.N. summit. The meeting will come just hours after face-to-face talks with Trump.", "description": "Donald Trump welcomed the call for a new Iranian nuclear pact", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169763312-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
