It was a play that epitomised the Carolina Panthers running back\u2019s astonishing tear this season: a searing pace that sees him on track for 2,771 scrimmage yards \u2013 262 more than Chris Johnson\u2019s NFL record from 2009.\n\nIn a blistering four seconds, McCaffrey sliced the Jaguars defence apart, fending off opponents with a stiff arm before absorbing Tre Herndon\u2019s hit on an audacious route into the end zone for one of his three touchdowns.\n\nThe Panthers would prevail, 34-27, and therefore roll into London with a 3-2 record, three weeks removed from star quarterback Cam Newton succumbing to an injury which threatened to derail their season.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

McCaffrey has revelled throughout the infancy of the NFL\u2019s offensive revolution. It has forced defences to evolve, implementing an additional corner back or cover safety with a linebacker removed, which has seen the running game become more fluid.\n\n\u201cHe runs his routes like a slot-receiver,\u201d Williams claims. \u201cHe runs his routes like a wide receiver, he\u2019d be just as efficient in the slot as he is in the backfield. It\u2019s tough for traditional running backs like myself to pick that up right now, Christian learned that since high school.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey will look to emulate the legendary Adrian Peterson as a back to win the league\u2019s prestigious MVP award, with the former Viking leaving his mark in London when he ran riot in a thrilling 34-27 win against the Steelers in 2013, justifying his status as the reigning MVP.\n\nBut with the Panthers a game behind the formidable Saints (4-1) in the NFC South, McCaffrey cannot allow his MVP contention to blur the ultimate goal of reaching the play-offs. His remarkable effort has enabled that to become a possibility despite Newton\u2019s absence.\n\n\u201cTo win the MVP, he would have to rush for over 1,000 yards (currently: 587 yards), catch for over 1,000 yards (currently: 279 yards), set the 2,000 mark and guide his team to the play-offs,\u201d Williams maintains, while not pretending Carolina\u2019s smaller market may limit the hype surrounding the premature stages of his campaign to beat out Patrick Mahomes and Russell Wilson.\n\nAnd with such an array of skills ready to be showcased at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Hall of Famer LaDainian Tomlinson aptly pinpoints why McCaffrey is so devastating \u2013 it\u2019s not just what he is capable of, it\u2019s more what isn\u2019t he capable of.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just so special, Mr Versatility, that\u2019s what I call him,\u201d the former MVP says. \u201cHe played over 95 per cent of plays last year because you can do so many things with him, he\u2019s so dangerous.\n\n\u201cFor me, he\u2019s just the best weapon in football right now.\u201d", "description": "Christian McCaffrey catapulted himself into the end zone last weekend, placing himself firmly into the MVP conversation.
