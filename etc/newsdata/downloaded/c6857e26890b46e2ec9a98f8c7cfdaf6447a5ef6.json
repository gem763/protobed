Hair: Sven Bayerbach. Make-up: Nicky Webb. Dress, Ghost London\n\nYesterday, I found myself at Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 5 at 6.30am. This is not somewhere you ever want to find yourself at that particular time of day, but when you book an 8.45am flight weeks in advance, you always forget how unbelievably early you\u2019ll have to get up in order to make it in time. \u2018Quarter to nine,\u2019 you think as your mouse stutters over the \u2018confirm\u2019 button. \u2018That\u2019s reasonable. And it seems a lot cheaper than the others.\u2019\n\nSo there I was, blurry-eyed, fighting through crowds of people ordering smashed avocado toast in Giraffe and elbowing my way into Dixons to buy a universal adaptor. Then I went to the loo.\n\nThe women\u2019s lavatories were further away than the men\u2019s \u2013 not by much, but they had been placed several feet along the corridor so that you had to walk past the men\u2019s to get to them. Perhaps it was because of the early start and the lack of sleep, added to the irritation that avocados on modern menus are always \u2018smashed\u2019, as if they\u2019ve starred in a violent Tarantino film, but these extra few paces annoyed me. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve noticed again and again in public places.\n\nIt happens in pubs and restaurants and cinemas. Quite often there will be a long, dark walk down some stairs into a dank basement, which leads you into the car park, where you make your way across several miles of barren wasteland until you come to a door with a handmade bolt across the front and peeling paint guarded by a small troll who requires the secret password to let you in \u2013 and that\u2019s the ladies.\n\nThis, at least, is what it feels like.\n\nI started wondering whether my anecdotal observation about women\u2019s loos held any, well, water. So, like a good almost-millennial, I took to Twitter. I posted my empirical findings and wondered if anyone else had noticed the same thing. Within seconds, my Twitter feed was awash (sorry) with other women confirming my suspicions. Alexandra was a fairly typical example. \u2018I had this exact conversation with a friend on Friday night,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018The ladies\u2019 toilet was another flight of stairs up from the men\u2019s! I can\u2019t think of anywhere I know where the ladies\u2019 loos are closer than the men\u2019s.\u2019\n\nOn and on it went: tales of ladies\u2019 loos shoved in some poky cupboard as an afterthought. Then the conversation became even more interesting when female academics piped up (sorry). I was told that, historically, pubs and many social gathering places were all-male environments which meant that when women were eventually allowed in, the proprietors had to find somewhere to put the female toilets \u2013 often in the basement.\n\nUntil the mid 19th century, most public toilets were designed for men. A woman could only travel as far as her bladder would allow and thus couldn\u2019t spend her time making a nuisance of herself by, say, meeting up with other women in a public space and demanding ludicrous things such as the vote. Selfridges was the first department store to introduce toilets for women in 1909.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t explain Terminal 5, however, which started construction in 2002. These days, there\u2019s no logical reason for a ladies\u2019 loo to be further away than the men\u2019s. I wonder if, because the majority of architects and urban planners are still male, they don\u2019t think to question it? And that\u2019s when a query about women\u2019s lavatories, which might seem frivolous, actually has serious repercussions: how much of the world is built around the prevailing male need, without much thought as to what women want?\n\nSo it turned out I wasn\u2019t imagining things after all. But some people on Twitter suggested I was. These people hadn\u2019t noticed any disparity. They claimed that if female toilets were further away than the men\u2019s, it was simply to accommodate \u2013 ho ho ho \u2013 women\u2019s longer queues.\n\nBut none of these people would have noticed because, unsurprisingly, they were all men.\n\nThis week I\u2019m\u2026\n\nChinti & Parker rollneck, Celebrity MasterChef, Grand Union\n\nWearing the best jumper for the changing seasons: a Dairy Milk purple rollneck from Chinti & Parker.
