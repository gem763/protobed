REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nThe FTSE 100 .FTSE fell 0.6% by 0830 GMT, while the FTSE 250 midcaps index .FTMC shed 0.7%, as mixed signals emerged from trade negotiations between the world's top two economies.\n\nAn index of banks .FTNMX8350 slipped 2%, dragged by Asia-facing financials, while the broader mining index .FTNMX1770 dipped 1%.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said on Friday that U.S. and Chinese deputy negotiators held \u201cproductive\u201d talks in Washington, but markets were left underwhelmed after Chinese agriculture officials cancelled a trip to U.S. farm states.\n\nThe FTSE 100, whose constituents bring in more than two-thirds of their profits from abroad, saw its steepest monthly fall this year in August when trade tensions between the United States and China escalated.\n\nWhile the index has enjoyed the benefits of a weakness in pound for most of 2019 as a painful Brexit process plays out, recent steps by lawmakers in preventing a no-deal Brexit has brought gains for the currency and in turn weighed on exporters.\n\nThe FTSE 100 has gained just 8.4% so far in the year, well behind its European counterpart\u2019s 15.1% rise.\n\nHelping limit Monday\u2019s losses were surges in tour operator TUI (TUIT.L), airlines Ryanair (RYA.L), British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) and easyJet (EZJ.L) as traders bet the Thomas Cook bankruptcy would cut some overcapacity in the market.\n\n\u201cThe effects will be felt across the sector, not all bad... airlines are firmer today as they should feel the benefit from the abrupt loss of short haul capacity,\u201d Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said.\n\nMarks & Spencer (MKS.L) lost 4.5% after it announced the abrupt departure of its chief financial officer.\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN.L) rose 1% after its diabetes treatment Qtrilmet moved a step closer to European Union approval on Friday.\n\n(Graphic: Thomas Cook share performance vs other UK tour and related companies link: here)", "description": "London's FTSE 100 index shed early gains on Monday as losses in banks and miners due to a lack of clarity in U.S.-China trade talks more than offset a rise in shares of travel operators and airlines after the collapse of Thomas Cook.", "authors": ["Muvija M", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432863351&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0EZ", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
