Fox News quoted a spokesperson from Dick\u2019s saying, \u201cWe are in the process of destroying all firearms and accessories that are no longer for sale as a result of our February 28th policy change. We are destroying the firearms in accordance with federal guidelines and regulations.\u201d\n\nDuring his October 6, CBS News appearance, CEO Ed Stack said the company ended up destroying $5 million worth of \u201cassault-style rifles.\u201d\n\nStack also admitted the Dick\u2019s gun control stance has resulted in \u201ca quarter of a billion [dollars]\u201d in loses. But Stack does not regret the gun control stance. Rather, he is considering taking the company even further down the gun control path.\n\nAs of right now, 100 Dick\u2019s stores no longer sell guns of any kind. Stack is thinking about expanding that policy so that no Dick\u2019s store sells a gun.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
