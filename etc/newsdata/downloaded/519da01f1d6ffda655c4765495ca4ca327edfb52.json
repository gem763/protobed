Jim Jordan, Devin Nunes, and Michael McCaul wrote to Schiff.\n\nThe three lawmakers are the top Republicans on the Oversight, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees, respectively.\n\nSchiff once touted the whistleblower as a key witness in the impeachment proceeding, but he now argues the whistleblower\u2019s testimony is not needed and in fact could endanger the whistleblower's anonymity and safety.\n\nRepublicans want to question the whistleblower about the extent of his contact with Schiff and his staff prior to filing a complaint against Trump in August with the inspector general of the Intelligence Community.\n\nRepublicans, in the letter to Schiff, outline inconsistencies in what the whistleblower claimed Trump said on a July 25 call with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, and what was discovered through other witness testimony.\n\nAmong the discredited claims, Republicans said, is one that Trump \u201cinstructed Vice President Pence to cancel his planned travel to Ukraine to attend President Zelensky\u2019s inauguration.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower also claimed then-Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland had \u201cspoken with\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, \u201cin an attempt to contain damage to U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nRepublicans said they \u201cexpect\u201d Schiff to arrange for the testimony because the impeachment inquiry was never formalized with bipartisan rules that would have at least allowed the GOP to request subpoenas for witnesses.\n\n\u201cWe may request additional witnesses at the appropriate time as the inquiry continues,\u201d the GOP lawmakers wrote. \u201cYour failure to arrange for the committee to receive this testimony shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process.\u201d", "description": "House Republicans, who have been denied the authority to request witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump, asked Democrats to summon the anonymous whistleblower to testify publicly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4366cf0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5153x2705+2+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F33%2F24%2F772b283df935b0bae80d7755830e%2F3ffcb3ebcd8ebeb2cdc0f98a04dbe9ae.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
