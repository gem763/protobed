Special agent, Will Glaspy, said:\n\n\u201cFrom his use of the dark web, to his clandestine manufacturing of counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl, to his drug sales targeting college students, Allawi operated with little concern for the people in our communities.\u201d\n\nCrypto and illegal drug sales\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that according to Ciphertrace\u2019s report on Anti-Money Laundering, almost all drugs sold on darknet marketplaces are purchased with cryptocurrencies. The darknet provides an environment that is attractive, lucrative and, for the most part, safe for illegal drug traffickers.\n\nProfessor Talis Putnins, co-author of an influential University of Technology Sydney report on cryptocurrency and illegal drugs, had this to say about cryptocurrencies:", "description": "Former Iraqi interpreter for the U.S. military sentenced to 30 years in jail for selling fentanyl on the dark web, taking payment in crypto", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvODJhMzAwOGZjNGVlNmExMjg1M2VjZGExZDE2MWU5ODIucG5n.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
