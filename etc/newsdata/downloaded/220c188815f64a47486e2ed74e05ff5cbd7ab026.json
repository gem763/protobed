The new plan offers the trio of apps plus 1TB of cloud storage, but double its old price. This makes the new Photography plan just $1 cheaper than the next price plan, a $21 / month plan that gives users access to one Creative Cloud app and 100GB of cloud storage.\n\nSome customers in certain regions are still able to access the old prices, but Adobe appears to be testing the new prices before rolling it out to all users.\n\nAn Adobe spokesperson told The Verge, \u201cFrom time to time, we run tests on Adobe.com which cover a range of items, including plan options that may or may not be presented to all visitors to Adobe.com. We are currently running a number of tests on Adobe.com. The plan can be purchased at http://www.adobe.com/go/photo18sptst, via phone at 1-800-585-0774 or via major retailers.\u201d", "description": "Adobe is testing raising the price for its Creative Cloud Photography plan, taking it from $10 / month to $20 / month.", "authors": ["Dami Lee", "May"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F9LuCZTcj_2HoCte6f187BOc4e8=/0x73:640x408/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/4068035/adobe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-02"}
