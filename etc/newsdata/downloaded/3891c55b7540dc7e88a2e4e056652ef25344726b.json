Don't use Juul. Don't start using nicotine if you don't have a pre-existing relationship with nicotine. Don't use the product. You are not our target consumer.\u2019\n\nA report by Public Health England said the devices are '95% safe' - but 'must be clearly positioned as products that help adult smokers to quit\u2019.\n\nCancer Research UK said: \u2018Studies show that levels of key harmful chemicals are lower in people who switch from tobacco to e-cigarettes. There are still some questions about long-term safety, as e-cigarettes haven\u2019t been around that long.\n\n\u2018But the evidence is pointing towards them being far less harmful than tobacco.\n\n\u2018In terms of safety, e-cigarettes are likely far closer to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). NRT has long been known as a much safer alternative to smoking.\u2019\n\nWatch the latest videos from Yahoo UK", "description": "Health authorities in America have issued a warning over the risks.", "authors": ["Rob Waugh"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XlYykMDF6gZqMAatDZ3m_A--~B/aD0yOTY1O3c9NDQ0NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-02/9bb81f10-2ad0-11e9-9ffe-46317d99afc2"}
