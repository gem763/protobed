But what really goes in to being an influencer? At New York Fashion Week, social influencers and bloggers shared their stories. (Sept. 19) AP\n\nAt first glance, Miquela Sousa is everything you would expect an Instagram-famous 19-year-old to be.\n\nShe\u2019s got a signature aesthetic, space buns and all. She\u2019s palled around with A-listers such as the Chainsmokers and Bo Burnham. Sometimes she takes a break from posting selfies to spotlight social causes, like family separation at the border or transgender rights. And, like almost every influencer, one could say Miquela lives online, broadcasting the ups and downs of her life to her 1.6 million followers on her Instagram account @lilmiquela.\n\n\u201cI ugly cried in front of about 50 strangers\u2026 and now he won\u2019t respond to any of (my) texts or pick up his phone,\u201d she wrote in one post about her on-again, off-again boyfriend, whom she calls \u201cangel boi.\u201d \u201cBrb crying to Lana for the next 19 years\u201d\n\nBut unlike other teens, Miquela doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be any age other than 19. She doesn\u2019t know acne breakouts. She doesn\u2019t know bad hair days. And she doesn\u2019t know any of her followers in person \u2013 and she never will.\n\nThat\u2019s because Miquela isn\u2019t a person. She\u2019s a digital avatar created through computer-generated imagery, or CGI.\n\nIn the last few years, Instagram has seen the emergence of a new kind of influencer, one whose image, agency and voice lie in the hands of people pulling their strings behind-the-scenes, often unbeknownst to their human followers.\n\nThough their presence on social media is rather new, experts say these accounts have potential not only to change the landscape of digital marketing but also to surface serious problems for the real world.\n\nTheir existence is fake, but their influence is real\n\nBrand partnerships are the lifeblood of full-time influencers, who are paid by companies to promote their products on social media. But are CGI influencers as effective at persuading the masses as their human counterparts?\n\nIt seems so, according to a study conducted by the social entertainment firm Fullscreen last year.\n\nFullscreen\u2019s director of strategy and cultural forecasting Mukta Chowdhary said the company conducted its study, \u201cCan CGI Influencers Have Real Influence?,\u201d when a brand inquired if partnerships with these accounts proved effective.\n\nSurveying more than 500 13- to 34-year-olds, Fullscreen sought to learn whether people who followed CGI influencers made purchasing decisions because of them. According to the results, 55 percent of people who followed CGI influencers made a purchase, 55 percent attended an event, 53 percent followed a brand and 52 percent researched a brand product.\n\n\u201cEven an influencer that's not human can have some sort of influence,\u201d Chowdhary said. \u201cThey're fake, but then they are creating buzz around them.\u201d\n\nMiquela herself has partnered with top brands including Samsung Mobile and Calvin Klein (even kissing model Bella Hadid in one ad), and Time magazine ranked her one of the 25 most influential people on the internet in 2018, among President Trump, Kanye West, Rihanna and Kylie Jenner.\n\nAccording to Frank Mulhern, a Northwestern University professor of integrated marketing communications, CGI influencers have a key advantage over their human competitors: the promise of complete control. After all, humans come with human error, but CGI influencers can be manipulated. They\u2019ll never go off-script or get caught in a scandal.\n\n\u201cThey're completely controlled,\u201d Mulhern said. \u201cThey can be programmed to say things and do things in online environments in ways that the brand marketers want them to.\u201d\n\nMulhern added he\u2019s unsure if CGI influencers are a passing trend or here to stay.\n\n\u201cIn advertising, there are a lot of cycles and fads and things come and go and something else could come along later that's different or better,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, this could stick.\u201d\n\nMany can\u2019t tell who's CGI and who's human\n\nPerhaps even more surprising than CGI influencers' persuasive power is how well they blend among real humans. That same Fullscreen study said 42 percent of Gen Z and millennials have followed an influencer they didn\u2019t realize was CGI.\n\nMulhern said CGI influencers will likely become \"indistinguishable from real people\" as technology improves.\n\nWhile the possibility of a CGI influencer who looks completely human may appeal to brands, Diane Pacom, a retired sociology professor at the University of Ottawa in Canada, worries about the social implications.\n\nFor Pacom, the rise of CGI influencers fulfills predictions put forth by 20th century philosophers like Jean Baudrillard, who warned of \u201chyperreality,\u201d or the replacement of the real with manmade constructions.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like prophecy,\" Pacom said. \"That slowly but surely we're living in a world where the real and the unreal \u2013 or the real and what is given, what has been constructed \u2013 will be completely confused, then fused.\u201d\n\nAttorney David Polgar, a tech ethicist and digital citizenship expert, said transparency is going to become key as the technology of CGI influencers advances.\n\n\u201cYou're basically assuming that they are a person who is making their decisions based out of free will, that they have some sense of volition or agency, when in fact it's a brand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's decisions that might be made by six people sitting in a conference room.\u201d\n\nWho are the real people behind the CGI influencers?\n\nThough some creators of digital influencers speak openly about their work, others are more elusive.\n\nCameron-James Wilson, for instance, has been vocal about creating Shudu, one of the world\u2019s first digital supermodels. Wilson created Shudu, inspired by the South African Princess Barbie, in 2017. Now, he's CEO of The Diigitals, an all-digital modeling agency.\n\nWhen Shudu went viral, Wilson said he found it important to clarify she wasn\u2019t real.\n\nIf \u201cI kept that a secret, the majority of people might think she's a real person,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThere needs to be a level of awareness about that with technology. I think that has potential to be abused.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Joerg Zuber has been open about creating Noonoouri, a CGI influencer whose brand partnerships include high-end fashion lines like Marc Jacobs, Balenciaga and Valentino.\n\n\u201cI decided for myself, if people ask me who's behind it, I definitely tell them the truth,\" Zuber said. \"If they don't ask, I just let it flow. I wouldn't say there is kind of a recipe how to do that.\u201d\n\nBrud, the company behind Miquela as well as two other CGI influencers named Blawko and Bermuda, has taken a different, more secretive approach. Rather than reveal their company as the mastermind behind Miquela, they wrote themselves into her story.\n\nMiquela debuted on Instagram in 2016, but Brud thrust her into the spotlight last year by staging a fake hijacking of her account by her CGI rival Bermuda. When Miquela regained control of her account, the forever-19-year-old opened up about her origins in an emotional post.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a robot,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t sound right. I feel so human. I cry and I laugh and I dream. I fall in love.\u201d\n\nMiquela also called out Brud for lying to her about who she really was.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so upset and afraid,\u201d she added. \u201cThe more I feel those feelings the worse it gets. These emotions are just a computer program. But yet they still hurt.\u201d\n\nThe people behind Brud have kept the company\u2019s internet presence scarce, with only a modest Instagram page and a website linking to a one-page Google document. The document describes Brud as \u201ca transmedia studio that creates digital character driven story worlds\u201d and names Sara DeCou and Trevor McFedries as its founders.\n\nAccording to Chowdhary, Brud\u2019s mystery makes Miquela more enticing.\n\n\u201cWe all kind of know what they're doing, but they haven't let down their guard,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's part of the intrigue. They know once the veil is lifted, the intrigue is gone.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cAlso, if you know too much about them, then little Miquela can't really shine. So they are building these personalities, and if you know the man behind the curtain, all of a sudden the whole 'Wizard of Oz' thing just kind of falls.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY's requests for comment to Brud have not been returned.\n\nWill CGI influencers replace human influencers?\n\nThe advent of the CGI influencer raises questions about the future of human influencers and what social media has become.\n\nWhile Dr. Mike Varshavski, an influencer whose Instagram account has amassed 3.3 million followers, finds CGI influencers fascinating, he doesn\u2019t think they threaten the traditional human influencer.\n\n\u201cI think they can coexist,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there's plenty of room for both to thrive and do well in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nVarshavski became an influencer when his Instagram account earned him a viral reputation as \"the hot doctor\u201d in 2015. The way he sees it, the ability for CGI influencers to be controlled to perfection may be their downfall.\n\n\u201cThere's something magical and interesting watching a human live their lives because humans are imperfect, and that sort of imperfection is really what makes being a human special,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can both live together harmoniously and help the field thrive even further.\u201d\n\nZuber said he never intended his CGI creation Noonoouri to replace the human influencer.\n\n\u201cI don't want to substitute real humans,\" he said. \"What Noonoouri is doing is she is enriching and enhancing maybe an existing campaign together with a person and to see how things are being transported through her eyes into life.\u201d\n\nFor Wilson, just because CGI influencers aren\u2019t real doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a place on social media. After all, he said, hasn\u2019t social media always been a haven for people to make believe?\n\n\u201cIt's a kind of fantasy world anyway, so what difference does it make throwing CGI into it?\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Chowdhary, the presence of CGI influencers on Instagram calls attention to the desire to project perfection on social media.\n\n\u201cCGI is almost poking fun about that polished look,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a fake person, but so is a super polished, human person on social media. You don't know their intentions better than you would little Miquela's.\u201d\n\nA future of CGI\n\nTwo days after her tearful breakup, Miquela lets her followers know she\u2019s \u201cstill heartbroken over angel boi\u201d but trying to move on. And what better way to do that than with a sound healing session at Unplug Meditation?\n\n\u201cTrying to ground myself with some sound healing,\u201d she wrote on Instagram, tagging the business. \u201cHope this works ~ I don't know what else to do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Unplug Meditation sponsored this post, but what is clear is how much Miquela's break-up resonates with her fans.\n\n\u201cafter my breakup with my ex, meditation was the only thing that could kept me function, stay strong girl,\u201d one user commented.\n\n\u201cu dont know what love is until u experience heart break. u just have to remember that every time u get hurt u r one step closer to the one u r destined to be with babygirl,\u201d wrote another. \u201ckeep on keeping on.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove sound healing,\u201d another wrote. \u201cthat should help your broken heart.\u201d\n\nThat last comment earned a reply from Miquela, who wrote, \u201cI def feel like its working!\u201d\n\nFor Pacom, a future that sees CGI influencers the same as humans does not look bright.\n\n\u201cIt's the person, talking with someone who looks like them, but who is the production of about 10 or 15 very intelligent adults with the sole purpose to manipulate them, to make of these young people consumers,\u201d she said.\n\nThough it\u2019s too late to change course, Pacom encourages Instagram users to think critically about what they see as they scroll.\n\n\u201cIt's already happening, so we cannot stop it. The only thing we can do is to create a critical perspective on it,\u201d she said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/10/16/cgi-influencers-blur-line-between-reality-and-fantasy-instagram-advertising/3790471002/", "description": "If you thought the Kardashians were fake, just wait until you hear about Miquela.", "authors": ["Charles Trepany", "Published A.M.
