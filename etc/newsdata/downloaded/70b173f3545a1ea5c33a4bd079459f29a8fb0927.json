He can appeal the fine.\n\n\u201c14K for some [expletive emoji] pants that are not gonna protect me from anything,\u201d Beckham wrote on Instagram. \u201cThis [expletive] is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe NFL rule book states that players must cover their knee area with their pants when playing. His pants failed to cover his entire knee when he played in the Browns\u2019 loss to the Seattle Seahawks Oct. 13 in Cleveland.\n\nThe former New York Giants wide receiver was also fined $14,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct in Week 4. He was briefly removed from the Browns\u2019 Week 2 game against the New York Jets because he was wearing an unregulated visor on his helmet.\n\nHe vented about the NFL\u2019s fine system after getting fined for an altercation with Baltimore Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey. He was also fined for wearing a watch while playing in Week 1.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy \u2026 The NFL finds ways to just take it,\u201d Beckham said in early October. \u201cThey\u2019re going to take it from you.

But pants above the knees, a shirt hanging out \u2014 and we\u2019re talking about a T-shirt that cost $5 to make, and you\u2019re getting $5,000 taken from you.\n\n\u201cPads above your knees, and I\u2019m like, \u2018You really think that this little knee pad covering my kneecap is going to affect, if somebody hits me, weighs 250 pounds, running 18 mph.\u2019 I don\u2019t do physics, but if I get hit, this is not going to protect me.\u201d\n\nBeckham has 29 catches for 436 yards and a touchdown in six games this season. He had six catches for 101 yards in the Week 6 setback. The Browns (2-4) face the New England Patriots in Week 8 after a Week 7 bye.", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 The NFL has fined Cleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. $14,000 for wearing his pants above his knees.
