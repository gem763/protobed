Is this the best we can do?\n\nIf our current tax system reduces the incentives to work, save, hire and invest, then shifting that burden by expanding the GST to cover fresh food, health and childcare will likewise reduce the incentives to purchase those products and services. This is not an outcome we should be aiming for.\n\nWhen a company like Netflix can pay just 0.06 per cent tax on local earnings, there are clearly some non-essential services that can shoulder more of the tax burden.\n\nMitchell Browne\n\nBlaxland, NSW\n\nHeavy hand needed for recalcitrant institutions\n\nScott Morrison speaks gravely to institutions that have not yet accepted responsibility for providing restitution, reconciliation and compensation to their victims of abuse, and asks them to \u2018\u2018Do the right thing; the honourable thing\u2019\u2019.\n\nThat\u2019s not good enough, Prime Minister. Remove their tax-exempt status and other privileges until they do comply and meet their obligations.\n\nIt\u2019s clear from their actions that only a financial \u2018stick\u2019 will carry any weight. Any \u2018carrots\u2019, whether about honour, fairness or responsibility, clearly do not work \u2013 we have ample evidence of that.\n\nPhilip Carman\n\nWest Perth, WA\n\nFroth and bubble for introverted Canberra\n\nSo much for the Canberra bubble. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has created his own bubble, in which he and the government make policy and decisions on the basis of a narrow, partisan view of the national interest and in isolation from experts and other sources of diverse thinking.\n\nClearly the PM is master of his own bubble. What is worrying is that he is now trying to control others outside the bubble.\n\nThe controlling rhetoric and actions of those inside the bubble include intimidation and punishment of dissenters in the media and individual whistleblowers, reducing the public service to \u2018yes men\u2019, suggesting the business sector stick to its knitting and not attend to \u2018social issues\u2019, accusing the media of misrepresentation, blaming \u2018negative globalism\u2019 for bad raps about government policies and the peddling of allegedly fraudulent documents.\n\nThe Morrison bubble has obvious similarities with the house of Trump and Australians should not miss the point that the bubble has a growing authoritarian nature.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition is treading water and appears to have become meek in the face of the Morrison bubble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Beavis\n\nMount Evelyn, Vic\n\nLet the private sector worry about new buses\n\nThe NSW Minister for Transport wants to replace all 8000 of Sydney\u2019s diesel buses with electric ones. This would come at a vast cost to the state, in a process that will take umpteen years and cause at least as much disruption as the light rail has done.\n\nSurely a decision on such an ordeal is best left to private industry? After all, the NSW government wants to privatise Sydney\u2019s buses. It would be nothing but stupid for it to invest huge amounts of money that could be better used for schools, hospitals, roads and so on, just so that the expensive new buses could then be sold for private operators.\n\nSomebody, please explain.\n\nGrant Agnew\n\nCoopers Plains, Qld\n\nRenewables not adding to the cost of energy\n\nThe article \u2018\u2018Basslink constraints add to grid concerns\u2019\u2019 (October 28) is misleading in two important areas. It implies renewables are adding to the price of energy whereas this is clearly not the case. Without this new supply, energy prices would be much higher due the closure of the old and unsafe Hazelwood site and the increasingly unreliable remaining coal-powered stations.\n\nAlso the journalist fails to acknowledge that South Australian power prices have plummeted to now be marginally below Victorian power prices and closing in on NSW prices. What is this telling us?\n\nRory Ross\n\nGlen Iris, Vic\n\nWeWork not really working as planned\n\nRobert Harley\u2019s \u2018\u2018Why the money is pouring into proptech\u2019\u2019 (October 24) implies that WeWork is a proptech business. You stand corrected \u2013 there\u2019s no proptech \u2013 just plain rent arbitrage and hot air.\n\nApparently WeDoesn\u2019tWork.\n\nCraig Wright\n\nElwood, Vic", "description": "Renewable energy, GST, tax-exempt churches, NSW buses, Scott Morrison's leadership.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3104%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d3f64d908726a7f8fb150e9a8f56f1a544e5540b", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
