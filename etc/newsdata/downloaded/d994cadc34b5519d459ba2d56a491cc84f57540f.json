It\u2019s increasingly obvious, however, that the president\u2019s claims aren\u2019t altogether true. Indeed, Defense Secretary Mark Esper explained on Friday that the Pentagon is dispatching armored vehicles and combat troops into Syria in order to protect oil fields.\n\nThe Washington Post had a fascinating behind-the-scenes report on this, noting that Trump administration officials came to realize that the president wouldn\u2019t be swayed by focusing on how his decision would affect other countries, because Trump didn\u2019t care if U.S. adversaries grew stronger as a result of his agenda. What the Republican did care about, however, was oil \u2013 so that\u2019s what officials emphasized to steer him away from the complete withdrawal he had in mind.\n\nOne official described the process of changing Trump\u2019s mind with an oil-centric pitch: \u201cThis is like feeding a baby its medicine in yogurt or applesauce.\u201d (The baby, in this analogy, is the Commander in Chief of the world\u2019s most dominant military.)\n\nThat said, the officials who assumed the president would be swayed by arguments related to oil were correct. Consider Trump\u2019s comments yesterday while announcing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s demise.\n\n\u201c[W]e are leaving soldiers to secure the oil. And we may have to fight for the oil. It\u2019s okay. Maybe somebody else wants the oil, in which case they have a hell of a fight. But there\u2019s massive amounts of oil. \u201cAnd we\u2019re securing it for a couple of reasons. Number one, it stops ISIS, because ISIS got tremendous wealth from that oil. We have taken it. It\u2019s secured. Number two \u2013 and again, somebody else may claim it, but either we\u2019ll negotiate a deal with whoever is claiming it, if we think it\u2019s fair, or we will militarily stop them very quickly.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the Syrian oil\u2019s value, Trump went on to say that the United States \u201cshould be able to take some,\u201d adding, \u201c[W]hat I intend to do, perhaps, is make a deal with an ExxonMobil or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly.\u201d\n\nIn context, \u201cit\u201d appeared to refer to extracting oil.\n\nSo to recap, Donald Trump, contradicting weeks of rhetoric about withdrawing troops from Syria, now wants Americans to know he\u2019s prepared to use the military \u201cto fight for the oil\u201d that he believes the United States is entitled to. Trump apparently intends to get ExxonMobil involved in the scheme.\n\nThe rhetoric was unexpectedly explicit, but it didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Ten days ago, as part of a White House teleconference with the International Space Station, the Republican took some time to declare, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken control of the oil in the Middle East, the oil that we\u2019re talking about; the oil that everybody was worried about.\u201d A few days later, he returned to the subject at a cabinet meeting, suggesting he might be willing to \u201cwork something out with the Kurds so that they have some money\u201d from the oil that Trump seemed eager to take.\n\nBetween Oct. 18 and Oct. 25, Trump proceeded to tweet about Syrian oil almost literally every day.\n\nThere are all kinds of questions surrounding the president\u2019s thoughts on this. It\u2019s not at all clear, for example, how exactly Trump thinks the United States will have the practical wherewithal to extract and export large quantities of oil from Syria. There\u2019s also the matter of international law, which frowns upon counties using military force to take the resources of foreign countries.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to believe Trump has thought this far ahead, and by all appearances, he doesn\u2019t seem to care.", "description": "Trump now wants Americans to know he's prepared to use the military \"to fight for the oil\" in Syria that he believes the United States is entitled to.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/13-10-17t192252z_1927604388_tm4e9ah0y8v01_rtrmadp_3_usa-energy-geopolitics.jpg?itok=ebQkr_Wu", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
