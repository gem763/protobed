For humans a sting from a man-of-war is usually excruciatingly painful, but rarely deadly.\n\nLocal man, Simon Maycock posted a photograph of one he found near Penzance.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They consist of four separate \u201cpolyps\u201d \u2013 these include the balloon-like body, which can inflate and deflate in order to regulate the creature\u2019s depth, the long poisonous tentacles, the digestive organs, and finally the reproductive organs.\n\nThey have no means of propulsion and are usually found drifting in warm oceans. They can sometimes be spotted in enormous groups of over a thousand individuals.\n\nReasons for ever-greater numbers of Portuguese man-of-war in UK waters include global climate change which has extended their range further north, and also the overfishing of species such as tuna and sailfish \u2013 the man-of-war\u2019s natural predators.\n\nAccording to popular mythology, using human urine is one way to lessen the pain from a sting, however recent research found urine actually aggravated the sting site and instead vinegar is recommended.", "description": "Bad things are happening in Cornwall.
