MSCI's broadest index of Asian shares excluding Japan dropped around 0.3%.\n\nBack in Europe, political developments closer to home also weighed on investors' minds. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told a German newspaper Friday that Britain would be responsible if a Brexit deal is not found.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday said that tempers needed to be calmed down following furious scenes in Parliament the previous day. His ruling Conservative Party is set to kick off its annual conference in Manchester next week.\n\nElsewhere, investors will look out for euro zone economic sentiment figures due to be released later in the morning.", "description": "Investor focus is largely attuned to U.S. politics, following the release of a whistleblower complaint against President Trump.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104112947-GettyImages-621883944.jpg?v=1532563983", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
