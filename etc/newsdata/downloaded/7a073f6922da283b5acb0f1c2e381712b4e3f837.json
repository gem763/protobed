Finding out that three-time Olympic champion Scott Moir would be there has to be the highest point. According to seven-year-old Mini Blades competitor Quinn Startek, that night \"was the best night of my life.\"\n\nMoir was at the Hamilton Skating Club helping out recently with the Mini Blades teams who are training there. \"It is great to see young athletes doing something just for the pure enjoyment. To me, these are the most important moments in our sporting careers,\" said Scott Moir, a self-described \"enthusiastic fan.\"\n\nThe Hamilton Skating Club, which is currently 900 members strong, has been offering skating programs since 1938 and calls the Dave Andreychuk Mountain Arena home. Numerous national and internationally successful skaters have come from this skating club, including current coach Bryce Davison, an Olympian and world medallist who was also a Battle of the Blades coach during Seasons 3 and 4.\n\nAs part of the coaching team for the Hamilton Mini Blades female skaters, Davison commented, \"for the figure skaters, Mini Blades gives them an opportunity to perform in a different setting than they are used to. For the hockey players, it completely takes them out of their environment.\"\n\nLet's find out a little more about the Hamilton Skating Club's Mini Blades teams:\n\n\n\nThe following teams from Hamilton Skating Club will perform for the live audience before the first episode of Battle of the Blades on September 19:\n\nAbbie Baltzer, 10 (Hamilton SC) and her brother Noah Baltzer.

Stock , Eric stepped up to fill in the gap.\n\nMaddyne Sullivan, 12 (Hamilton SC) /Tighe Frazee, 14 (Southern Tier Admirals)\n\n\"I wanted to be part of BOTB because I think it is really fun to join figure skaters and hockey players together. I also thought it would be fun to skate with my cousin!\" said Maddyne.\n\n\n\nDuring the second episode (Sept. 26), these teammates will perform:\n\nJackson Spraggon, 15 (Glancaster Bombers) and Quinn Startek, 7 (Hamilton SC) on ice discussing tips and tricks with Scott Moir.\n\nQuinn Startek, 7 (Hamilton SC) /Jackson Spraggon, 15 (Glancaster Bombers)\n\nThe Quinn and Jackson story is a \"small world\" story. Quinn's dad went to high school with Jackson's parents and Jackson worked as a summer hockey camp assistant to Ryan Risidore, the husband of Hamilton coach Mandy Risidore. Not only that, Quinn's mom Mariessa has known Jackson since he was six years old and attended the elementary school where she teaches.\n\nThe audience for Episode 3 (Oct 3) will see this skating duo.\n\nAriella Landey, 10 (Hamilton SC) /Ian Montour, 12 (Lockport Monsters)\n\nAriella is a competitive dancer and was a USASA Snowboarding national competitor, finishing 7th at Nationals in Colorado.", "description": "Scott Moir visits to The Hamilton Skating Centre to practise with with young hockey players and figure skaters \u2014 the new generation of 'Mini Blades' contestants for this upcoming season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5283405.1568408556!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/the-hamilton-skating-centre-crew-poses-with-scott-moir.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
