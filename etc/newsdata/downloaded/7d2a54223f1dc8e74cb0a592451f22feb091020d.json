That was well before \"influencer\" was considered a job title and the same year that Instagram debuted. Her empire really began to take off when she started her makeup line in 2013 (when she couldn't find false eyelashes to buy, she said).\n\nThat cosmetics company, Huda Beauty, which she started with her two sisters (Mona and Alya) after quitting her job in finance, has become her main source of wealth. It has catapulted her net worth to an estimated $610 million, according to Forbes.\n\n\"Today, Huda Beauty sells more than 140 products from eyeshadow pallets to lip gloss, which bring in at least $250 million in annual sales,\" according to Forbes. \"Private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners acquired a small minority stake at the end of 2017 in a deal that valued the company at $1.2 billion.\"\n\nHuda Beauty is sold through the major cosmetics retailer Sephora, and the Kattans now have a Facebook Watch original series, \"Huda Boss,\" which follows their personal and professional lives.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider, Huda, the CEO of Huda Beauty, and her sister Mona shared their tips for influencers who want to start a business.\n\n1. Just start\n\nHuda and Mona started Huda Beauty with their sister.

She said she initially thought, \"that could never happen\" and told herself to \"be realistic.\"\n\n\"I think it's really important just to get started,\" she said. \"Know what your goals are. Know your north star. Just be diligent, relentless.\"\n\nHuda said she didn't think it made sense to compare yourself to people who are on their \"day 100\" when you're at your \"day one.\"\n\n2. Surround yourself with a good group and get a 'cheerleader'\n\nThe sisters said a support group was important to their success in business. Kayla Williams/Beck Media\n\nThe Kattan sisters agreed that what's helped them the most throughout their success in business has been having a good group of people around them.\n\n\"You need a cheerleader,\" Mona said, as Huda quickly added that your \"group\" doesn't have to be family like theirs is. A close friend or mentor can work too because when you get into entrepreneurship, you need to \"have someone cheering you on because it gets so rough,\" Huda said.\n\nAnd if there's no one to turn to, cheer yourself on, Huda said. A fan of journaling as a form of self-reflection, she said that writing down thoughts and ideas could help when you feel lost.\n\n\"I think sometimes you need to find your own way of cheering yourself on too,\" Huda said.\n\n3. Get your legal work right from day one\n\nBrian Ach/Getty Images\n\nOne of the worst mistakes the sisters have seen people in the industry mess up on \u2014 especially startups, they added \u2014 is when a company's accounting and legal services aren't set up properly.\n\n\"Get your legal work right from day one,\" Mona said.\n\nThe sisters said that straightening out the legal aspects of their business was something they worked to take care of early on, and Huda added her early interest in studying law helped with that.\n\n\"A lot of people think good lawyers are expensive,\" Mona said. \"But bad lawyers are much more expensive in the end. Not having that right will screw you up later on.\"\n\nFor more on the business of being an influencer, and a breakdown of how they make their money, check out these Business Insider Prime stories below:\n\nAn Instagram influencer breaks down how much brands pay for sponsored posts, starting at 10,000 followers.\n\nHow Instagram influencers land their first brand sponsorship deals.\n\nHow to get free products from brands without millions of Instagram followers, according to an influencer who scored a vacation from Disney.", "description": "Huda Kattan is the self-made millionaire behind the cosmetics line, Huda Beauty, and shares advice for business success.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d63e1b92e22af049743bd32-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
