and schemes such as the Help to Buy Equity Loan.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe initiative, which launched in 2013, was designed to boost house building and provide a lifeline to those struggling to raise a deposit, enabling them to buy a new home with just 5% equity, topped up with a Government loan of 20% (or 40% in London) that is interest-free for the first five years.\n\nHowever, there are fears the attractiveness of it has led to developers inflating prices on Help to Buy homes - seeing buyers pay more.\n\nJust last month, housebuilding giant Barratt Developments announced pre-tax profits of \u00a3910million, or \u00a350,400 per home, with 40% of customers using Help to Buy Equity Loans.\n\nWhere help to buy is costing you 20% more\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe Help to Buy premium is highest in the north and parts of the Midlands, with first-time buyers using the scheme in Yorkshire, the West Midlands and the North West paying approximately 20% more than those buying new homes independently.\n\nScotland has also seen a rapid increase in the premium paid by those using Help to Buy over the past year, peaking at 14.7% in September 2019.\n\nIn London, the Help to Buy premium has remained relatively stable over the past twelve months and currently stands at 11.8% - marginally higher than the England average.\n\nThe current Help to Buy Equity Loan Scheme will be replaced by a new version launching in April 2021 that will be restricted to first-time buyers only and for properties with a market value up to new regional price caps.\n\nIt will run for two further years before closing in March 2023.\n\n\"Help to Buy might be better named Help to Sell, since our research shows that despite the scheme\u2019s popularity with buyers, housebuilders are the ones reaping the benefits,\" Rob Houghton, chief executive of ReallyMoving - who conducted the research - said.\n\n\"Most first-time buyers find it difficult to raise a deposit and as a consequence they are being cornered into the new build sector, where homes already command higher prices, before paying an additional premium on top if they need to use a Help to Buy Equity Loan.\n\n\"In many cases they simply don\u2019t have the deposit required to explore other options such as buying a second-hand home, which may offer considerably better value.\"\n\nThe main concern with Help to Buy is that when the homeowner comes to sell, they could find themselves in negative equity and unable to compete with new developments nearby, forcing them to accept a lower price.\n\n\"It\u2019s important that those using the scheme consider their exit strategy, including whether or not they can afford the loan repayments on top of their mortgage when the interest free period comes to an end,\" Houghton added.\n\nBut while Help to Buy may be inflating homes for those using the scheme, critics say elsewhere, it's also having a negative impact on the overall market - by pushing up second-hand homes.\n\nBad news for everyone else\n\nAcross Great Britain, the average cost of a first time buyer property has increased by 32.8% since 2013, almost on par with the regular market, according to a report by Springbok Properties.\n\nIt said that while Help to Buy has given many a leg up when it comes to climbing the property ladder, the influx of additional demand has also, perhaps ironically, pushed the cost of Help to Buy homes up considerably.\n\nThe largest increase has been in Barking and Dagenham with FTB house prices now at \u00a3281,396 in 2019, an alarming 70.8% increase from 2013.\n\nWaltham Forest in North East London has seen the next largest uplift, rising by 68.7% to \u00a3408,233;\n\nThe average first time buyer price is up 60.7% in Newham to \u00a3349,874 and 60.1% in Havering to \u00a3307,874.\n\nOutside of London, Thurrock in Essex has increased 59.2% to \u00a3237,635; and Stevenage in Hertfordshire is up by 58.7% to \u00a3250,086.\n\n(Image: Google)\n\nThe City of Aberdeen is the only area of the UK where first time buyers are paying less than in 2013. The price they paid has fallen by -10.9% to \u00a3126,794 in 2019.\n\nIn England, the worst climber is County Durham in the North East, where prices rose by 3.5% to \u00a388,790.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only East London region to see huge increases the average first time buyer price, as they rose by 60.7% in Newham to \u00a3349,874 and 60.1% in Havering to \u00a3307,874.\n\n\"Help to Buy was introduced by the previous Government with good intentions \u2013 to assist would-be home-buyers in their first step onto the property ladder,\" Founder of Springbok Properties, Shepherd Ncube explained.\n\n\"However, it seems that whilst around 200,000 buyers have indeed been supported, the unintended consequence in most areas has seen an above average hike in prices driven by the demand that Help to Buy has created.\n\n\"First rung homes are supposed to be more affordable, but we\u2019ve seen the average price paid by a first time buyer accelerate to similar levels as the wider market. Not only has this made it more difficult for today\u2019s aspirational homeowner, but perhaps some tax-payers might question the wisdom of using their money to fuel house prices even further?\"\n\nHelp to buy explained\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHelp to Buy is characterised by three schemes.\n\nThe Help to Buy Equity Loan was launched in 2013. It allows buyers to contribute a 5% deposit towards a new build, with the government providing a 20% equity loan on the property, or 40% within London, which is interest-free for the first five years.\n\nThis is available on new builds under \u00a3600,000 in England and \u00a3300,000 in Wales. The scheme will run until 2023, though after 2021 it will only be available for first time buyers and there will be caps on the value of homes people can buy.\n\nThis is the most well-known of the Help to Buy schemes.\n\nThe second scheme is the Help to Buy Mortgage Guarantee, which also launched in 2013. In this, the Government acts as a guarantor against a loan - and properties aren't restricted to new builds only. This scheme was discontinued in 2016.\n\nThen there's the help-to-buy ISA, launched in 2015, which saw savers pay money into an ISA and then get a cash bonus form the Government.\n\nThe scheme closes for new entrants this November when it will be fully replaced by the lifetime ISA .\n\nYou can currently still choose between the two though - see our guide on the help to buy ISA vs lifetime ISA, here .", "description": "The \u2018Help to Buy Premium\u2019 in England was 10.3% in the twelve-month period to September 2019 - but it's more than double that outside London", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Bloomberg Via Getty Images", "Getty", "Google"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12462534.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/A-row-of-new-homes-on-estate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
