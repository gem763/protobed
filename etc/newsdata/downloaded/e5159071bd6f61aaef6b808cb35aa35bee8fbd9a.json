Senate and House Republicans are helping him by sticking by his side. That\u2019s not an opinion; it\u2019s a fact.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S ADMINISTRATION IS BROWBEATING U.S. ALLIES -- Australia, Italy, Ukraine, the United Kingdom -- to investigate the origins of the Mueller probe.\n\nTHE ONLY DIFFERENCE OF OPINION NOW is not over the facts, really. Republicans say there\u2019s nothing to see here; it\u2019s just Trump trying to root out corruption. And Democrats say his own words are evidence that the president is deeply unfit for office and deserves to be impeached.\n\nEVIDENCE: A NUMBER OF STORIES dropped Thursday night that confirm this thesis, including a batch of text messages that look damning for the administration.\n\n-- WSJ: \u201cTrump Ordered Ukraine Ambassador Removed After Complaints From Giuliani, Others,\u201d by Rebecca Ballhaus, Mike Bender and Vivian Salama: \u201cPresident Trump ordered the removal of the ambassador to Ukraine after months of complaints from allies outside the administration, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, that she was undermining him abroad and obstructing efforts to persuade Kyiv to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201d\n\n-- NYT: \u201cTrump Envoys Pushed Ukraine to Commit to Investigations,\u201d by Ken Vogel and Mike Schmidt: \u201cTwo of President Trump\u2019s top envoys to Ukraine drafted a statement for the country\u2019s new president in August that would have committed Ukraine to pursuing investigations sought by Mr. Trump into his political rivals, three people briefed on the effort said.\n\n\u201cThe drafting of the statement marks new evidence of how Mr. Trump\u2019s fixation with Ukraine began driving senior diplomats to bend American foreign policy to the president\u2019s political agenda in the weeks after the July 25 call between the two leaders.\n\n\u201cThe statement was drafted by Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, then the State Department\u2019s envoy to Ukraine, according to the three people who have been briefed on it.\u201d\n\n-- NBC: \u201cU.S. ambassadors pushed Ukraine to investigate as condition for White House visit, texts show,\u201d by Josh Lederman: \u201c\u2018Heard from White House \u2013 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for a visit to Washington,\u2019 former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations Kurt Volker wrote the top Zelenskiy aide on July 25, just before Trump spoke by phone to Zelenskiy. That phone call led a U.S. intelligence official to file a whistleblower complaint that set off a cascade of fast-moving events, ultimately leading to an impeachment inquiry into the president.\u201d The texts between Sondland and Volker\n\nSUCCESS \u2026 @JonahFisherBBC: \u201cBREAKING: Ukraine\u2019s current prosecutor general says his office is going to review up to 15 cases that involve Burisma - the company that Joe Biden's son Hunter worked for.\u201d\n\nAND THEN THIS \u2026 CNN: \u201cTrump raised Biden with Xi in June call housed in highly secure server,\u201d by Kylie Atwood, Kevin Liptak, Pamela Brown, Jim Sciutto and Gloria Borger: \u201cDuring a phone call with Xi on June 18, Trump raised Biden's political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who by then had started rising in the polls, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed.\n\n\u201cThe White House record of that call was later stored in the highly secured electronic system used to house a now-infamous phone call with Ukraine's President and which helped spark a whistleblower complaint that's led Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\u201d\n\n-- ALSO WILD: \u201cIn that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed.\u201d\n\nGood Friday morning.

He talked about what he considers an abuse of norms in the process. Rep. STEVE CHABOT (R-Ohio), who was a manager during the Bill Clinton impeachment, detailed what lawmakers could expect.\n\nSCALISE will begin a series of briefings the week Congress comes back into session to discuss messaging and to get the GOP on the same page with strategy.\n\n-- House Minority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY and other Republican leaders feel like they have a winning political argument in the impeachment procedure Speaker NANCY PELOSI is employing. GOP leadership sources tell us that they believe Pelosi\u2019s decision to not hold a vote to start an impeachment proceeding -- like other Congresses have -- will play poorly for Dems on the campaign trail.\n\n-- THE DCCC IS WHACKING MCCARTHY, pointing out that many of the things he said in his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview are \u201cwildly out of step with the American people.\u201d Memo from the DCCC\n\n-- MEL ZANONA and BURGESS EVERETT: \u201cRepublicans prep formal rebuke of Schiff to defend Trump\u201d: \u201cHouse Republicans will force a vote to formally condemn Rep. Adam Schiff when they return from recess, their most aggressive offensive yet as the GOP fumbles for a strategy to beat back impeachment efforts.\n\n\u201cThe largely symbolic move, which won\u2019t get approved by the Democrat-controlled House, is backed by the House\u2019s highest-ranking Republicans and some of President Donald Trump's close allies on Capitol Hill: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).\n\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to exercise the limited tools we have in the minority, and we\u2019re going to fight to get the truth out and hold [Schiff] accountable for falsehoods,\u2019 Scalise said in an interview.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- MIAMI HERALD: \u201cPelosi says impeachment \u2018doesn\u2019t need too much inquiry\u2019 at Venezuela event in Florida,\u201d by Bianca Padr\u00f3 Ocasio and Alex Daugherty: \u201cAbout 300 miles south from where President Donald Trump was speaking with supporters in Central Florida, the Democratic leader who backed a process of impeachment in the House of Representatives last week said Thursday the congressional probe wouldn\u2019t \u2018need too much inquiry.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018The president has confessed to his violation of his oath of office, and right there, there it is. So it doesn\u2019t need too much inquiry,\u2019 said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at a roundtable with local Venezuelan leaders in Weston. \u2018But that\u2019s up to the committee,\u2019 she added.\u201d Miami Herald\n\n-- MARC CAPUTO in Weston, Fla.: \u201cPelosi: \u2018I\u2019m very worried\u2019 about whistleblower\u2019s safety\u201d: \u201cHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday she was \u2018worried\u2019 about the safety of the whistleblower who first reported that President Donald Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into investigating one of his Democratic rivals, Joe Biden. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018What happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u2019 Trump said. Pelosi said Trump essentially admitted to an impeachable crime. \u2018The president has confessed to his violation of his oath of office,\u2019 Pelosi told reporters when asked about Trump\u2019s request that China also investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201c\u2018Our founders were very suspicious of foreign interference in our government,\u2019 Pelosi said, \u2018and to ask a foreign government to assist in our election undermines the president\u2019s oath of office and threatens the integrity of our electoral system and it is wrong.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- TOWN HALL DISPATCH \u2026 L.A. TIMES\u2019 JEN HABERKORN in Rhinebeck, N.Y.: \u201cPeter Plavchan Sr. put on his red Make America Great Again hat Tuesday night and settled into the front row of a town hall meeting with his new congressional representative, Democrat Antonio Delgado, in the rural Hudson Valley.\n\n\u201cWhen his time came to speak, Plavchin didn\u2019t hold back. \u2018I can\u2019t quite say you represent me,\u201d he told Delgado in a packed room of about 100 people, citing the impeachment inquiry that both Delgado and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) formally supported last week. \u2018I would like you to identify tonight the exact crimes that you think have been committed, the crime that caused you to [support] impeachment.\u2019 But in a 70-minute meeting, that was the only time a constituent raised the issue.\u201d LAT\n\nLOTS OF WHISTLES BEING BLOWN \u2026 WAPO: \u201cIRS whistleblower said to report Treasury political appointee might have tried to interfere in audit of Trump or Pence,\u201d by Jeff Stein, Tom Hamburger and Josh Dawsey: \u201cAn Internal Revenue Service \u00adofficial has filed a whistleblower complaint reporting that he was told that at least one Treasury Department political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president\u2019s or vice president\u2019s tax returns, according to multiple people familiar with the document.\n\n\u201cTrump administration officials dismissed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint as flimsy because it is based on conversations with other government officials. But congressional Democrats were alarmed by the complaint, now circulating on Capitol Hill, and flagged it in a federal court filing. They are also discussing whether to make it public.\u201d WaPo\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

But his travels to Ukraine lately have embroiled him in the impeachment inquiry engulfing Trump and his inner circle, even though two of the people called the scandal unrelated to Perry's departure, which they said he has been planning for several months.\u201d POLITICO\n\nRBG SPEAKS -- BOSTON GLOBE: \u201cJustice Ginsburg\u2019s assessment of today\u2019s political climate: \u2018an aberration,\u2019\u201d by Laurie Loisel in Amherst: \u201cSupreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may be known for thoughtful, finely honed legal opinions, but when asked Thursday what historians will see when they look back on this period in US history, she offered up a terse, two-word answer.\n\n\u201c\u2018An aberration.\u2019 Apart from the warm standing ovation that greeted Ginsburg when she took to the Amherst College stage, that was the only time during her talk that the capacity crowd of 1,600 broke into applause.\u201d Boston Globe\n\nVARIETY: \u201cDana Bash to Produce Political Drama Series \u2018The Hill\u2019 in Development at NBC\u201d: \u201c[T]he series is described as a character drama that lives at the supercharged intersection of media and Capitol Hill where everything is transacted: information, sex, love, fame and power.

Barr took aim at Facebook\u2019s plan to make WhatsApp and its other messaging services more secure, pressing its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to create a loophole to that goal of full encryption. The Justice Department said that investigators needed lawful access to encrypted communications to fight terrorism, organized crime and child pornography.\n\n\u201c\u2018Companies should not deliberately design their systems to preclude any form of access to content even for preventing or investigating the most serious crimes,\u2019 Mr. Barr, joined by his British and Australian counterparts, wrote in a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg that was reviewed by The New York Times and dated Friday.\u201d NYT\n\n-- \u201cMark Zuckerberg leaks his own meeting,\u201d by The Verge\u2019s Casey Newton\n\nMEDIAWATCH -- Juan P\u00e9rez Jr. will be a K-12 and higher education reporter at POLITICO Pro starting in November.
