The plan would require Russia to fully withdraw from Donbas and organize an election on self-rule in the eastern Ukrainian territory, administered with the oversight of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Russia would agree to withdraw and Ukraine to not actively govern the region if its people vote against it. The plan is named after German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who proposed it in 2016 when he served as foreign minister.\n\nCritics contend that Russia has repeatedly denied having an official military presence in the territories of Ukraine it has colonized, instead opting for the use of unofficial militias doing Moscow\u2019s bidding against the Ukrainian people. The Steinmeier Formula has no detailed provisions on how to ensure that Russia keeps its promise of keeping Russian forces out of Donbas while locals vote.\n\nThe plan Zelensky agreed to also does not specify what \u201cself-rule\u201d in Donbas would look like, arousing suspicions among Russian officials.\n\nZelensky was elected in a resounding rejection of Ukraine\u2019s political establishment after playing President Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko, a high school teacher who suddenly becomes president, in the series Servant of the People. Following the success of the series, independent Ukrainian activists established the \u201cServant of the People\u201d political party, which took over the presidency in May.\n\nHis predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, criticized Zelensky\u2019s acceptance of a pathway to elections as a victory for Putin.\n\nProtesters demanded Zelensky\u2019s exit from the presidency in Kyiv\u2019s Maidan, the square popularized by the anti-Russia protests that brought Poroshenko to power, chanting \u201cZelensky out!\u201d and \u201cNo capitulation,\u201d according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The Kyiv Post noted that, while the protests in front of Ukraine\u2019s presidential offices attracted the most attention, Zelensky faced protests in at least three other major cities: Lviv, Kharkiv, and the key port city of Mariupol.\n\nPoroshenko has publicly come out in support of the protesters.\n\n\u201cThe Steinmeier formula means Putin\u2019s formula, which radically changes the sequence of actions within Minsk agreements and throws away the roadmap of Minsk agreements,\u201d Poroshenko said in a recent interview.\n\nUpon agreeing to the Steinmeier plan, Zelensky insisted that no elections would occur if there was any indication that Russia was not complying with the Ukrainian demand that all foreign occupiers leave the Donbas region.\n\n\u201cThere will be no elections \u2018at the gunpoint\u2019 \u2026 If someone (militants) will be there, there will be no elections,\u201d the president said. He added that the election laws governing the voting would be Ukraine\u2019s, not Russia\u2019s, and that the election would be rendered void if the OSCE found any evidence of fraud or coercion.\n\nThe Kremlin appeared to accept Zelensky\u2019s deal on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that this is an important step toward implementing the earlier agreements,\u201d Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters,\u201d calling it a \u201cpositive\u201d move. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry condemned Zelensky on Thursday, however, for going forward with military equipment purchases following the deal \u2013 a sign he did not expect a guaranteed success from the agreement.\n\n\u201cWhat Ukraine really needs today is a settlement of the internal Ukrainian conflict, an end to the crisis in many fields, a better situation in the economy and struggle against corruption, harmonization of internal political processes and search for identity,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. \u201cI do not think that the supply of the weapon systems in question will be able to help resolve these issues somehow. But it will most certainly hit the Ukrainian budget once again.\u201d\n\nThe Russian news agency TASS also cited \u201cconcerns\u201d in Moscow that Zelensky stating he is seeking a new law on governance in Donbas and his lack of specificity in what \u201cself-determination\u201d means in the event of an election there is a sign he will not accept Russia colonizing more Ukrainian land.\n\nRussia occupied, colonized, and ultimately annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014, claiming its population was ethnically Russian and did not want to be bound to Kyiv.\n\nOver 13,000 people have died in fighting between Ukraine\u2019s military and illegal pro-Russian guerrillas in the country\u2019s east since 2014, according to the latest United Nations estimates, and total casualties number over 40,000. As the debate over the Steinmeier formula raged, Russian guerrillas conducted 30 different attacks on the Ukrainian military on Wednesday, according to the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces of the Russian Federation and its mercenaries violated the ceasefire 30 times on October 2. A Ukrainian soldier was wounded as a result of enemy shelling,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s forces confirmed.\n\nThe two sides are technically bound by an \u201cindefinite\u201d ceasefire agreed to in July.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Ukrainians protested President Volodymyr Zelensky for choosing to accept an agreement that would bring elections to Russian-occupied Donbas.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178365919-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
