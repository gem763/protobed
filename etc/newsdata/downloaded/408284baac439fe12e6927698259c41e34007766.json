But the two \u201cdear friends\u201d only managed to discuss the most powerful man in the world, President Trump, for a grand total of 30 seconds.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump actually started to win, I never would\u2019ve imagined that I\u2019d see newscasters quoting my show like it was the Bible. It was just so weird. And they were bringing up my name in the debates and all this other stuff, and it was kind of surreal,\u201d Stern explained. \u201cAnd then I said to myself, well, maybe I\u2019m sort of a journalist? Journalism comes in strange ways, because I had all this wealth of material with Donald Trump\u2014who by the way, was the best radio guest ever because he would say things that no one else on the planet would say.\u201d\n\nEarlier on in the program, Kimmel took aim at one of his favorite targets: Melania Trump. The comic had previously joked that the White House sinkhole was one of the first lady\u2019s escape tunnels to get away from her misogynistic husband, and on this night, he focused on her decision to erect a tennis pavilion on the White House grounds.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, as her husband tries to dig up dirt on his opponents, the first lady is building a tennis pavilion on the White House lawn\u2014for real. As if they\u2019re going to be there to enjoy it,\u201d cracked Kimmel, before showing a photo of Melania in green stilettos sticking a gold-plated shovel into the ground. \u201cThere she is, breaking ground in her most rugged pair of construction stilettos. She\u2019s definitely digging an escape tunnel, right? That\u2019s either an escape tunnel or a shallow grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love that with all this chaos going on, Melania thought, \u2018I will build a tennis pavilion!\u2019\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cAnd now, once that\u2019s built, all guests of the White House will have a front-row seat to this,\u201d the comic continued, before throwing to that infamous photo of an out-of-shape Trump playing tennis in tighty whities-revealing short shorts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s John Big MacEnroe! It\u2019s Billie Jean Burger King! It\u2019s Roger Well-Federer!\u201d exclaimed Kimmel to roars from his audience.", "description": "The \u2018Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u2019 host welcomed Trump interviewer Howard Stern onto his program but saved his most brutal barbs for the first lady.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_738,w_1312,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570682610/Screen_Shot_2019-10-10_at_12.37.12_AM_qmxbbh", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
