If he manages to form a government, his party would be in charge of nominating the country's next candidate for the European Commission.\n\nRomania's first candidate, Rovana Plumb of the Social Democrats, was rejected last month by the European Parliament. Should Orban nominate someone from his own party as Plumb's replacement, that raises the prospect of the EPP gaining an extra spot in the next Commission at the expense of the Party of European Socialists.\n\nThe outgoing government proposed Dan Nica, a Social Democrat member of the European Parliament, to replace Plumb but incoming Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen did not nominate him.\n\nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis had been consulting with party leaders since the Social Democrat government under Prime Minister Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 was toppled in a confidence vote in the national parliament last week. D\u0103ncil\u0103's grip on power had become increasingly shaky in recent months, after her coalition partner quit and MPs from her own party abandoned its ranks.\n\nIohannis, a former leader of the National Liberal Party, said the PNL \"was the only party that came to the consultations and said directly, although it will be hard, that it is willing to take on governing during this transition period.\"\n\nIohannis said the new prime minister-designate will have a short mandate as he declared he favors an early parliamentary election.\n\nThe next parliamentary election is officially due at the end of 2020 or in early 2021, but it could be brought forward to early next year, after Romanians choose a new president next month.\n\nOrban now has 10 days to come before the Romanian parliament with a proposed Cabinet and a governing plan. He needs the support of a majority of MPs to take office.\n\nThe European Commission and Western governments accused D\u0103ncil\u0103's administration of backsliding on corruption and the rule of law. D\u0103ncil\u0103 hit back by accusing her critics of double standards.\n\nOrban, a 56-year-old former minister, said his government would offer Romanians \"honesty, competence, integrity, dedication to serving the public interest and solutions to the big problems.\"", "description": "New administration could change political balance of next European Commission.", "authors": ["Anca Gurzu", "Carmen Paun"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176003501-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
