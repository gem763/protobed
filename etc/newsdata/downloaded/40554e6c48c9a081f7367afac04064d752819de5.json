A couple so forkin\u2019 cute, they needed a panel all to themselves. The Good Place cast members D\u2019Arcy Carden and Manny Jacinto make their Vulture Festival debut to talk about playing an unconventional couple, to say the very least. The conversation will be moderated by demon - The Good Place: The Podcast host, Marc Evan Jackson.\n\nMAILCHIMP PRESENTS GOING THROUGH IT LIVE. We can\u2019t tell you exactly what it is, but, if you\u2019ve been through it, you know. Host Tracy Clayton sits down with a guest for a live recording of the Mailchimp Original podcast, Going Through It. They\u2019ll talk about facing down a pivotal moment where they had to make a choice: quit, or keep going.\n\nA STAR IS BORN POOLSIDE SCREENING PRESENTED BY VIRGIN VOYAGES. Hey! What? Just wanted to take another look at you, A Star is Born! There are a lot of movies about the highlights and pitfalls of fame, but none of those movies have original pop songs by Lady Gaga and original rock songs by Bradley Cooper. (Also none of those movies have electrical tape eyebrows and Sam Elliott\u2019s deep voice.) Join Vulture\u2019s resident A Star is Born stan Hunter Harris for a special poolside screening and pop-rock singalong of Jackson Maine and Ally\u2019s greatest hits.\n\nTHE CO-STARS/CO-CREATORS OF PEN15 IN CONVERSATION OVER AIM.

OMG it\u2019s the creators and stars of Hulu\u2019s puberty-comedy Pen15, Anna Konkle and Maya Erskine. That\u2019s right, the duo will be interviewed the only way appropriate for a show about turn of the millennium teenage life - instant messenger. Hear how they worked to get the era of the show correct and how they pulled from real life experience, while also watching their honed chatroom skills.\n\nPARTY DOWN REUNION. Party Down catering is here to make sure our \u2018dervs stay refreshed and that all of you stay out of our medicine cabinets.

All he wanted was a \u201ctoo small\u201d steering wheel and a car that was \u201cstinky.\u201d Is that so wrong? The result was one of the most beloved sketches in recent history. And at Vulture Festival, we\u2019ll gather the geniuses behind it to discuss how they caught lightning in a bottle. I Think You Should Leave\u2019s co-creators Tim Robinson and Zach Kani will be joined by the sketch\u2019s director, Akiva Schaffer. [Dabs in excitement.]\n\nSUNDAY DINNER WITH THE ONE DAY AT A TIME FAMILY.\n\nReunite with the Alvarezes for the biggest Sunday family dinner you\u2019ll attend this year when the cast of One Day at a Time comes together for the first time since finding a new home on Pop TV, exclusively at Vulture Festival.

Elisabeth Moss is a performer who is never afraid to work up close, taking us from Madison Avenue to Gilead with a look. Now, Moss comes to Vulture Festival to walk us through what Vulture\u2019s Emily Yoshida called an \u201coscillating, energy-devouring performance\u201d as Becky Something in the 2019 drama Her Smell. Find out what it takes to inhabit the worlds Moss consistently brings to life for us.\n\nCOMEDIANS YOU SHOULD AND WILL KNOW SHOWCASE.\n\nVulture\u2019s annual Comedians You Should and Will Know list highlights those comics who we believe, in our professional opinion, will soon become household names. And now we\u2019re bringing a selection of them to Vulture Festival for a night of laughs, hosted by a very special, soon-to-be-announced guest.\n\nYOU AND YOU. Ever since you finished the first season of You on Netflix, you\u2019ve been unable to stop thinking about it. You\u2019ve been scrolling past it constantly, waiting eagerly for the day it finally says \u201cnew episodes.\u201d Well, let Vulture Festival help stem your cravings with a Q&A with series creator Sera Gamble, a special screening, and a few\u2026 [ominous narrator voice] surprises.", "description": "Vulture Festival LA Presented by AT&T will feature a Party Down cast reunion, The Good Place, One Day at a Time, Elisabeth Moss, Netflix\u2019s You, I Think You Should Leave, Pen15, and A Star Is Born", "authors": ["Anne Victoria Clark"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-vflalineup1.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
