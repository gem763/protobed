It also became a way of transcending the borders imposed on his life by the Israeli occupation; a medium to connect with the world outside. He started with covers of western pop before releasing his own songs, some in Arabic and some in English \u2013 invariably with catchy hooks, bold, self-produced videos, and satirical lyrics addressing freedom of expression.\n\nMore like this\n\n- What is history\u2019s most enduring tune?\n\n- How pop embraced sexuality without labels\n\n- The rock \u2018n\u2019 roll rebel of Afghanistan\n\nIn 2009, Bashar began sharing his music on Facebook and uploading it to YouTube and Soundcloud. Soon after, he added it to Spotify but struggled to find a local audience because the platform was only accessible to Palestinians registered in foreign markets using a virtual private network (VPN). The absence of a Middle Eastern \u2018hub\u2019 \u2013 one of Spotify\u2019s online spaces highlighting music communities through curated playlists and editorial \u2013 also meant that Bashar\u2019s music was not being discovered overseas.\n\nAs a westerner, you hear the phrase \u2018Arab music\u2019 and you think of something you heard 40 years ago, but that\u2019s not accurate anymore \u2013 Larry LeBlanc\n\nYet a decade on, Murad\u2019s work now has global traction. In April, he performed at Palestine Music Expo (PMX) in Ramallah, in the West Bank, the larger of the two Palestinian territories that includes East Jerusalem. He then flew to Toronto for Canadian Music Week, where he represented the Palestinian territories for the first time in the annual event\u2019s 36-year history, alongside Kallemi, a Swiss-Palestinian all-female hip-hop outfit. More recently, Murad collaborated with Icelandic techno group Hatari, and their video has been viewed over 1 million times online. He\u2019s in talks with several labels about his debut album.\n\nMurad\u2019s success is part of a much bigger jigsaw. If you look carefully at festival line-ups, label release schedules, and agency rosters, Palestinian artists from various genres are appearing more regularly, which is remarkable given the singular challenges they face.\n\nWhile Murad, a pop act in the traditional sense, performed in Canada, TootArd, a psych-rock sensation in the Middle East, were preparing to play at Glastonbury. Late last year, Oud masters Le Trio Joubran released their latest album through UK label Cooking Vinyl, and followed it with a performance at The Barbican in London. Sama, the first Palestinian DJ to emerge internationally, recently released a BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix.\n\nI\u2019d always imagined doing the things I am doing now, but I didn\u2019t think it was possible because there were no resources \u2013 Bashar Murad\n\nThe landscape for Palestinian music, and, indeed, Arabic music as a whole, is richer than it\u2019s ever been. Larry LeBlanc, a leading Canadian music journalist and international consultant to PMX, tells BBC Culture: \u201cAs a westerner, you hear [the phrase] \u2018Arab music\u2019 and you think of something you heard 40 years ago, but that\u2019s not accurate any more. This is commercial music, and it\u2019s extremely exportable.\u201d This would seem to have been behind Spotify\u2019s decision to become the first major streaming service to launch in the region last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always imagined doing the things I am doing now, but I didn\u2019t think it was possible because there were no resources,\u201d Murad says. \u201cBut I think Palestinian musicians are figuring out how to get our voices out to the international world.\u201d\n\nThe challenge to be heard\n\nThere have always been Palestinian musicians, of course, but their extreme circumstances have made it unlikely for their work to be heard. At the heart of the issue is a lack of local infrastructure. The only three music venues in the Palestinian territories are in the West Bank, but their large size makes them unsuitable for emerging pop acts. Because of this, concerts must be held in restaurants or make-shift halls, and it\u2019s not always possible to convert these into a space fit for music. The few companies that rent the required gear out are not affordable for the majority of the Palestinian population. Throwing events comes with risk given the size of the initial financial outlay.\n\nThe only other venue that is a key hub for Palestinian musicians is Kabareet in the Israeli city of Haifa, run by locals and Jazar Crew, a Palestinian underground DJ collective. Since its launch four years ago, the spot has become a second home for Palestinians with an Israeli passport or those with documents allowing them to travel through Israel.\n\nCulture is a kind of peaceful resistance, and a way of preserving our cultural identity and heritage \u2013 Rania Elias, Director of Yabous Cultural Center\n\nWhat\u2019s more, any concerts risk being shut down. The Palestinian Authority (PA) is forbidden from conducting any activities in East Jerusalem under the Oslo Accords, and Israel often prohibits cultural or political activities by Palestinian organisations on the grounds that they\u2019re connected to the PA and erode Israeli sovereignty in the city. Earlier this year, Israeli forces were reported to have shut down a Palestinian football tournament, and, in August, they prevented a memorial service for the Palestinian writer Subhi Ghosheh from taking place at the Yabous Cultural Center.\n\nRania Elias, director of Yabous, tells BBC Culture: \u201cSeveral times we\u2019ve announced readings, concerts, and exhibitions, and they\u2019ve been stopped by Israeli forces,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey come one hour before the event with soldiers and an order saying that, according to the information they have, we are organising an event that is against the security of Israel.\u201d She has then been required to attend an interrogation and shut down the centre temporarily. \u201cCulture is a kind of peaceful resistance, and a way of preserving our cultural identity and heritage,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt gives people hope, and so they [the Israeli forces] don\u2019t want these events to happen.\u201d\n\nBBC Culture contacted Gilad Erdan, Israel\u2019s Minister of Public Security, for comment. His office explained: \u201cResidents of East Jerusalem are free to hold any cultural and sporting event and we welcome the cultural richness of our capital Jerusalem, which is a city of peace and a hub of tourism worldwide. The only limitation in the law on holding cultural events in the city is on events in the organization or sponsored by the Palestinian Authority, which is a hostile political factor for Israel and a terrorist supporter, which works in every way to undermine Israeli sovereignty in our capital.\u201d\n\nErdan\u2019s office confirmed the closure of the memorial service, but added: \u201cThe event presented is just one example of the PA's activity in Jerusalem, which is involved in organising events of this kind, in order to violate Israeli sovereignty and strengthen its status among East Jerusalem residents. This activity is also an intentional breach of the law for the implementation of the Oslo Accords. Minister Erdan prohibits holding such events in accordance to the law, and every order he signs on it is backed by intelligence that proves the PA's involvement and has been examined by a legal adviser.\u201d\n\nElias insists that the PA had no involvement in the event: \u201cWe, as Yabous Cultural Center, were approached by the family of the deceased, who set up the memorial and they arranged for the ceremony. The event was organised by the family of the deceased. According to my knowledge, there is no involvement for the PA.\u201d The Burj al-Luqluq Society, which organizes the soccer tournament, also denies any connection to the PA, and insists that it does not receive any funding from it.\n\nEvents across the rest of the West Bank, except Area C, which is under Israeli control, are monitored by Palestinian Authorities who require no licence. Permission must, however, be sought from security officials, which is normally granted provided there are no obvious reasons for them to object. In any case, a strictly enforced 2am curfew is enforced.\n\nRecording and releasing music is also challenging. There are studios in Ramallah and East Jerusalem, one of which Murad uses, but recording gear is not affordable for those less fortunate. High import taxes rule out delivery by post, meaning that equipment must be brought in by those who are able to travel abroad, and it can be hard to carry it across international borders.\n\nThere is one well known music label, Samer Jaradat Entertainment, in the Palestinian territories, but very few, if any, others that are fully operating, partly because there are so few people trained in copyright law. This requires that artists self-release, uploading onto online platforms such as Spotify, Deezer, YouTube, and Soundcloud themselves in the faint hope that their music will find an audience.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to focus on music because we don\u2019t have the basics to live \u2013 MC Gaza, rapper\n\nIn cash-stripped Gaza, the smaller Palestinian territory, there are even fewer opportunities. Recording studios are scarce, and any equipment must be sourced from Egypt or Israel at an extraordinary premium. Hamada Nasrallah, vocalist for Sol, a seven-piece folk outfit from Gaza, explains that he had to sell off his possessions just to afford a guitar, only for it to be destroyed in the August 2018 Israeli bomb attacks on the Said al-Mishal Centre.\n\nThe electricity shortages and lack of drinking water make it \u201chard to focus on music\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t have the basics to live\u201d, MC Gaza, a local rapper, says. Hamas, the Islamist organization that governs the territory, shuts down events because alternative music undermines Muslim traditions.\n\nExacerbating the problem are the restrictions on movement that Palestinians face, which means that many cannot travel abroad for gigs, or, significantly, meet with industry professionals. Special permits are required to enter Israel, which are rarely granted, especially not quickly. Palestinians have long had no access to airports in the Palestinian territories: those in Jerusalem and Gaza ceased operations around the turn of the millennium, so most Palestinians must travel to Jordan in order to fly anywhere, which costs around US$500 (\u00a3400) one-way.\n\nA world with borders\n\nThose in Gaza have great difficulty in travelling at all. There are only two crossings out: Rafah and Erez, controlled by Egyptian and Israeli authorities respectively. Passing through Rafah requires registration on one of two lists, one co-ordinated by the Hamas-affiliated Ministry of Interior, the other by Egyptian authorities. These lists are long, and waiting times are unpredictable because the crossing is not always open; before May 2018, it was open for only a few days a year \u2013 although the situation has improved since then. Egyptian officers have also been alleged to accept bribes, ranging from US$2,000 (\u00a31,600) to US$10,000 (\u00a38,000) and paid via Palestinian brokers, to expedite an application. This is unaffordable to the vast majority, and leaves those without money with little hope.\n\nErez, meanwhile, is also tricky, and, for reasons of security, only Israeli-defined categories of people, mainly those requiring urgent medical attention, are eligible for a permit. Permits are also granted to businessmen, students, and artists, but they are far from guaranteed: PMX has applied on behalf of Sol each year, only to be denied each time. This year, they got lucky, but only for Nasrallah, allowing him to exit Gaza for the first time in 24 years. He was notified by telephone just hours before his performance.\n\n\u201cPalestine is such a small piece of land and there are borders all around you,\u201d local artist Rasha Nahas, a member of Kallemi, tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because there\u2019s a lot of badass artists, musicians, and thinkers working hard on what they believe in.\u201d\n\nNahas is privileged in that she was born in Haifa, Israel, and so is permitted to travel outside of the West Bank \u2013 but this precludes her from travelling through the Middle East because few countries in the region recognise Israel as a state. She now bases herself in Berlin, where she\u2019s signed with her first management agency, and is pursuing a career as a solo artist. Her first album, an intimate take on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll with dirty electric guitar tones and poetic lyricism, will be released next year.\n\nThe position of those born in Jerusalem is uniquely complicated. After occupying and annexing East Jerusalem following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel offered Palestinian residents Israeli citizenship but many refused, and instead took permanent residency, allowing them to live, work, and receive benefits in Israel. They have what\u2019s called a \u2018laissez-passer\u2019, a travel document that allows them to pass through Israel, but they cannot pass into another country without a visa, which is hard to obtain because they don\u2019t have any citizenship.\n\nIt\u2019s a business and they cannot make much money from us \u2013 Suleiman Harb\n\nTake rock band El Container, for example. All six members grew up in East Jerusalem, and so have permanent residency in Israel, but their official nationality is \u2018undefined\u2019, and they have no passport. Suleiman Harb, a band member, explains that to travel they must apply to festivals online in the hope of endorsement for an entry visa, which rarely comes. \u201cIf we just do it on our own then it\u2019s likely we won\u2019t get a visa,\u201d Harb says, \u201cbut we couldn\u2019t do normal tours anyway because this would require a lot of money and there\u2019s no guarantee of return.\u201d\n\nThis also scuppers their chances of releasing their music because labels are reluctant to sign a band unable to tour across the primary Arabic markets, namely Lebanon, Syria, and Dubai. \u201cIt\u2019s a business and they cannot make much money from us,\u201d Suliman says. \u201cWe have these tough circumstantial issues because of where we live on top of the same problems as any other band.\u201d\n\nDespite these difficulties, the band has performed in Turkey, Italy, Morocco, Jordan, and Egypt. They\u2019ve declined other invitations because they\u2019re sent with the wrong intentions. \u201cThey try to connect Israeli and Palestinian bands on the same stage to show that they can exist in the same space, so the music is never the focus,\u201d Harb says.\n\nMusicians in the Golan Heights face similar difficulties for the same reasons: Israel annexed the land, seized from Syria, after the Six-Day War. Although Syrian, the local musicians are considered part of the Palestinian scene because they\u2019re subject to similar restrictions: they are not even allowed to travel to Syria, so they can pass through Israel and the West Bank only.\n\nAll four members of TootArd, whom promoters regularly label as Palestinian, grew up in the village of Majdal Shams in the Golan area, and have permanent residency in Israel, but their official nationality is also \u2018undefined\u2019, and they have no passport. Visa issues have forced them to decline offers from Beirut, Dubai, Kuwait, and Algeria, which have particularly strict visa requirements.\n\nAcross the Palestinian territories, many artists face similar challenges with gaining a world platform. Some of these \u2013 like Murad, TootArd, El Container, and Rasha Nahas \u2013 are beginning to develop an international audience, but others are still coming to terms with the boundaries they face. What unites them is an optimism for change.\n\nThere is now a diversity to the [Palestinian music] scene, and it\u2019s starting to come out \u2013 Mahmood Jrere, DAM\n\nMahmood Jrere has been monitoring this evolution. Alongside brothers Tamer and Suhel Nafar, Jrere is part of DAM, the Palestinian Territories\u2019 first hip-hop group and one of their most celebrated breakout acts. In 1999, when the band formed, the Palestinian landscape for alternative music was barren except for Sabreen, formed in Jerusalem in the 1980s, in part because musicians had no hope of success. Their music connected with Palestinians because it spoke about reality and violence in contrast to the love and romance of Arabic classical and pop music. \u201cThat\u2019s why DAM decided to write hip-hop, and I think we broke out because people felt the same way,\u201d Jrere says.\n\nTaking advantage of the internet, which now allowed artists to distribute their work across borders, they connected with London label RCM \u2013 Red Circle Music, who signed them up in 2006. DAM\u2019s success inspired an era of Palestinian hip-hop, but it\u2019s only more recently that the region\u2019s musical tapestry has developed. \u201cHip-hop broke out, but what\u2019s different now is the other genres,\u201d Jrere explains. \u201cThere is now a diversity to the [Palestinian music] scene, and it\u2019s starting to come out.\u201d\n\nA new network\n\nAt the centre of this evolution is PMX, a meeting point geared towards providing Palestinian artists with opportunities to showcase their music, learn new skills, and connect with the global music industry. Each year, the organisers invite delegates from around the world to meet local musicians and watch them perform. If the Palestinian territories can\u2019t go to the world, then the world will come to them. Behind the event is Martin Goldschmidt, co-founder of Cooking Vinyl Records, who set it up as a means of contributing to Palestinian culture, only to be \u201cblown away\u201d by the depth of musical talent.\n\n\u201cIt [PMX] gives artists opportunities,\u201d Jrere says, \u201cand encourages them to take a step forward, to continue perfecting their sound, and to develop their brand.\u201d It also creates a healthy bit of competition, and connects the various musical scenes that for so long had been fragmented. Rasha Nahas adds: \u201cIt made Palestinian musicians realise that things are possible. You have a different drive when you know you might play to Sony in half a year\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nSpotify\u2019s launch in the Middle East is either reflective or anticipatory of a large global interest in Middle Eastern music \u2013 and while they declined to speak to BBC Culture for this piece, it\u2019s certain that the service\u2019s territorial expansion in November 2018 was founded on data. The streaming giant\u2019s new presence there is helping Palestinian musicians in two important ways: providing those who live in the Palestinian territories with a platform on which to listen to them; and, through the \u2018Arab hub\u2019, presenting them to global audiences by adding their music to playlists, an important means of music discovery.\n\n\u201cSince the launch of Spotify in the Middle East, I have seen an intense rise in the number of new people following my music,\u201d Murad says. \u201cIceland, Japan, etc: It would have been impossible for me to reach these people otherwise.\u201d\n\nWithin three years, everybody is going to be talking about music in the Middle Eastern region, including Palestine \u2013 Martin Goldschmidt\n\nIt remains to be seen how big Palestinian music can become. Goldschmidt believes this is the start of something bigger. \u201cWorld music has always been dominated by English-speaking music, but now you\u2019ve seen K-Pop and South American music, and also Indian and Chinese music; within three years, I feel everybody is going to be talking about the Middle Eastern region, including Palestine.\u201d\n\nHussain Yoosuf, senior vice-president of creative and A&R at Reservoir, an independent music publisher based in New York, believes it\u2019s only a matter of time before we see Palestinian musicians in the global charts.\n\n\u201cWhat you find is that repression leads to expression, and markets like Palestine are hotbeds of creative talent because of the political situation they\u2019re in,\u201d he says. He believes it\u2019s now about connecting the \u201craw talent\u201d with those able to harness it \u2013 \u201cthen we\u2019ll have a global and not just a Palestinian hit,\u201d he says.\n\nIf this is to happen, there\u2019s work to be done. Being able to present their music to industry professionals is a major step, but local infrastructure is needed for Palestinian musicians to flourish. Acknowledging this, the team behind PMX is providing equipment and running workshops in copyright law to facilitate the launch of labels, distributors, and collection societies. There are plans to open a permanent office in Ramallah to connect artists with foreign promoters and assist with travel arrangements.\n\nBut one big obstacle that all Middle-Eastern pop artists still face is the way they tend to be pigeonholed in the West. Rasha Nahas tells BBC Culture that her Arabic heritage sees her categorised as \u2018world music\u2019 and booked at special Arabic events, where her work doesn\u2019t really fit. \u201cAs a Palestinian artist, you always have people impose on you your genre; people always think we are going to play traditional Palestinian music, but we\u2019re like every other place in the world with lots of artists doing different things.\u201d\n\nLeBlanc, who has attended PMX each year, feels that only those able to sing in English will cross over into the mainstream charts, while others will depend on sales in Arabic-speaking countries. \u201cAs soon as they sing in their own language, they\u2019re thrown into the worldbeat category, even though they\u2019re not really worldbeat groups.\u201d\n\nBut, above and beyond commercial success, the hope is that the world will recognise the artistic talent within the Palestinian territories. For so long, the focus has been on conflict at the expense of culture, and only now are we taking a real look inside.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
