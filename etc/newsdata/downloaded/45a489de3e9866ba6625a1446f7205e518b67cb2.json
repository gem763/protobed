REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - The World Bank on Sunday slashed its growth forecast for India\u2019s current fiscal year to 6%, down from 7.5%, warning that the \u201csevere\u201d slowdown could further weaken the country\u2019s stuttering financial sector.\n\nIn its last forecast in April, the bank had said that India\u2019s economic outlook was strong and expected growth of 7.5% during the current fiscal year that began in April.\n\nBut Asia\u2019s third-largest economy is currently growing at its slowest pace in six years, expanding by just 5% in the April-June quarter, hit by flagging consumer demand and a slackening in government spending.\n\nIndia\u2019s industrial output also shrank at its fastest rate in more than six years in August, data released last week showed, indicating that a slew of government measures had yet to underpin a recovery.\n\nIn an effort to kick-start the economy, India\u2019s central bank has cut interest rates five times this year, and underlined the challenge for policymakers by downgrading its growth forecast to 6.1% from 6.9% earlier this month.\n\nLast week, ratings agency Moody\u2019s Investors Service lowered its growth forecast for India to 5.8% for the current fiscal year from 6.2%, adding that a long period of weak growth will hamper the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation plans.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s latest forecast also underlined similar concerns linked to slowing growth and New Delhi\u2019s decision to cut the corporate tax rate, which will cost about 1.5 trillion rupees in tax revenues.\n\n\u201cWhile the authorities have shown steadfast commitment to fiscal prudence, the significant growth deceleration as well as the corporate tax cuts undertaken to counter it come with heightened risks of fiscal slippage,\u201d the bank\u2019s report said.\n\nThe bank said it expects the economy to gradually recover, growing at 6.9% in the fiscal 20/21 starting next April.", "description": "The World Bank on Sunday slashed its growth forecast for India's current fiscal year to 6%, down from 7.5%, warning that the \"severe\" slowdown could further weaken the country's stuttering financial sector.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440313663&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C07W", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
