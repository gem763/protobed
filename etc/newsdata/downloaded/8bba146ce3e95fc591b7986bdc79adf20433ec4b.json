For many, the book offered a rare chance to not feel like the odd one out, or better still, to be glad that they were the odd one out. Out of love, I have two copies of Harriet the Spy. One is from 1974, with the original illustrations by Louise Fitzhugh in all their heartfelt precociousness. The other is from 1981, and rather than any illustrations, the cover instead hosts a photo of a girl dressed up as Harriet, and this is the version I remember most fondly. In keeping with Fitzhugh\u2019s iconic vision, Harriet proudly wears the same faux-spectacles, crumpled jeans with big turn-ups, the oversized hoodie, the pair of sneakers with long laces, and the leather belt from which hangs an assortment of tools that I always envied as a preteen.\n\nI still dress like Harriet to this day, right down to the cuffs on my baggy denim. And, as many Facebook photos from the early 2000s will attest, there was also a time when I even wore the completely pointless black glasses without lenses. I\u2019m pretty sure if you zoomed in on a few particularly pretentious photos from 2005, you\u2019d even find a moleskine notebook folded in my back pocket too.\n\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\nIn other words: Harriet the Spy is resplendent with Big Dyke Energy. When I found out later in life that Louise Fitzhugh was queer too, it was no surprise. There is, in fact, a legacy of kids\u2019 books by queer illustrators and authors produced in the same golden era of children\u2019s literature: Maurice Sendak (Where the Wild Things Are); Margaret Wise Brown (Goodnight Moon); Arnold Lobel (Frog and Toad) and Tove Jansson (the Moomin series); to name a few. These are all books that are compassionate and, more importantly, contain narratives that are more concerned with the highs and lows of being alive than boring old virtue.\n\nPhotograph: HarperCollins\n\nHarriet the Spy blurred the lines between right and wrong in a way that liberated my nine-year-old mind. As a kid who already felt left out by the mechanisms of femininity that everyone around me seemed to adopt with ease, Harriet was the blue denim baby butch I needed among the endless ballerina narratives. Back then, I didn\u2019t yet have the words for what I felt fizzing through my insides, and even now, 15 years after coming out, I\u2019m only just learning to feel comfortable with how I present: non-binary, butch.\n\nHarriet\u2019s dedication to her spy route made perfect sense to me too. When you\u2019re an outsider, observing the machinations of other people can often feel like you\u2019re doing the work of a spy. It was a relief to read the extracts from Harriet\u2019s notebook, where the \u201cnormal\u201d society she reported on from her spy route was so elegantly and brutally reduced to nothingness in a few sentences, always in her assertive, trademark caps-lock font.\n\nOle Golly\u2019s message to Harriet was practical and tender: do what you have to do to survive, and don\u2019t feel too guilty\n\nDespite not having any openly gay characters (the book was first published in 1964) Harriet the Spy still has excellent queer morals. Re-reading it as an adult, I feel myself getting teary over the necessary \u201clittle lies\u201d that Ole Golly, Harriet\u2019s ex-nanny, highlighted in her parting letter. Ole Golly brusquely explained that these \u201clittle lies\u201d would be necessary in order to get by in the real world, and she lists among other examples that it\u2019s like \u201cthanking someone for a meal they made even if you hated it\u201d. Poignantly, Ole Golly then signs off her letter with, \u201cBut to yourself you must tell the truth\u201d.\n\nMost people avoid ugly animals. I'm obsessed with them | Sami Bayly Read more\n\nWhat queer hasn\u2019t told \u201clittle lies\u201d in order to survive? Truth and honesty are always things that are coveted in childhood, as long as the truth is palatable. But being butch, binding your chest, using different pronouns and wearing your dad\u2019s shirts: these are truths that plenty of people still don\u2019t want to hear. Ole Golly\u2019s message to Harriet was practical and tender: do what you have to do to survive, and don\u2019t feel too guilty about it. As a kid, that was a revelation. Louise Fitzhugh taught me how to forgive myself.\n\nLooking at those book covers now, Harriet the Spy was practically a queer prophecy. When you\u2019re nine, making sense of those early queer sensations is lonely work. For me, finding Harriet was like stumbling across an inexhaustible, reassuring voice: it will be possible to be the person you already sense you are, deep down. In the words of Harriet\u2019s beloved nanny Ole Golly: \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re an individual, and that makes people nervous. And it\u2019s gonna keep making people nervous for the rest of your life.\u201d", "description": "As a kid who already felt left out, Harriet was the blue denim baby butch I needed among endless ballerina narratives", "authors": ["Kat Patrick"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81d874b34ab08374a7be96f8904551a68188bb2e/0_147_3351_2010/master/3351.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6adc8f5670bd0130e2c917ee030c56cd", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
