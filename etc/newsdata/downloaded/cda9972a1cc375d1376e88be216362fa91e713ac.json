(AP) - Bo Nix and the Auburn Tigers are trying to get the offense back on track following their first loss and an open date.\n\nThe 11th-ranked Tigers struggled offensively in a 24-13 loss to No. 9 Florida , lost their top tailback to injury and had an extra week to try to resolve everything that went wrong. Now, Auburn (5-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) tries to get the offense going again Saturday at Arkansas (2-4, 0-3) with a visit to No. 2 LSU looming.\n\nNix especially struggled against the Gators, throwing for 145 yards with three interceptions and some misfires on potential big plays in a follow-up to his superb performance against Mississippi State. Coach Gus Malzahn, who calls the offensive plays, is hoping the extra week of self-evaluation was good for settling in more on what the freshman quarterback can do best at this point.\n\n\u201cYou get on the practice field and the things that he can execute at a high level, that\u2019s what you call,\u201d Malzahn said Tuesday. \u201cThings that maybe we need a little more time, we don\u2019t call it. It\u2019s really as simple as that: what he feels comfortable with. And we worked hard on that last week, and we\u2019ll continue that this week. Now he feels more comfortable with a lot of things - more than he did the first game\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the same true freshman he was that very first game of the year where we\u2019re learning. We know a lot about him, he knows a lot about our offense and we have a plan for him moving forward in the season.\u201d\n\nFor the next month or more, that plan won\u2019t include Auburn\u2019s most consistent offensive weapon.\n\nTailback JaTarvious Whitlow is expected to miss 4-to-6 weeks with a left knee injury sustained against Florida. He has run for 544 yards and seven touchdowns.\n\nIt leaves a bigger role for his backups, ranging from veterans Kam Martin and Malik Miller to freshman D.J. Williams, who has only seen action in one game while nursing an injury.\n\n\u201cOur mindset as a group is kind of, \u2018Next man up\u2019 mentality,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBoobee (Whitlow) was a leader of the group. He\u2019s a vital part of the offense. But we\u2019re a very confident group. We have confidence in everybody in the room and we all know what we bring to the table. So we know we\u2019ve got to step up, but we\u2019ve been ready. We\u2019re ready for the challenge.\u201d\n\nThere was plenty of room to improve on the performance against Florida, which does have one of the SEC\u2019s top defenses. That ranges from the blocking to the play-calling.\n\nWide receiver Anthony Schwartz, one of college football\u2019s fastest players, didn\u2019t have a catch. His only offensive touch came on a run when he lost 4 yards.\n\nNix and Auburn will face an Arkansas defense that ranks 12th in the SEC in points allowed and 13th against the run. He passed for 335 yards against Mississippi State and ran for 56 before the setback in Gainesville.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a very talented guy,\u201d Arkansas defensive coordinator John Chavis said. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously a dual threat. He can beat you throwing, he can beat you running. He\u2019s a guy that you\u2019re going to have to account for in this offense.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bo Nix and the Auburn Tigers are trying to get the offense back on track following their first loss and an open date.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Zenor"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/auburn_florida_football_53138_c0-159-3808-2380_s1200x700.jpg?bc02f18713a4bc5a178f686762926e34314ac1c8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
