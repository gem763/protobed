However, there are drawbacks to investing in a 401(k). Some are particular to 401(k) plans in general, while others are specific to individual plans. You might already be familiar with some of the more obvious drawbacks, but others may have escaped your attention, so take a look at 25 potential negatives to your 401(k) plan that will help you to better understand and optimize it.\n\nLast updated: Oct. 21, 2019\n\nFor all of the publicity surrounding how great it is to invest in a 401(k) plan, the investments themselves are often shrouded in mystery. You typically set up automatic investments through your employer, allocate your money across various funds and the rest takes care of itself. If your investments cost you anything, you don\u2019t usually feel it since the process is so automated.\n\nHowever, behind the scenes, your 401(k) plan is taking a cut. As an investor, you\u2019ll pay the expense ratio on various funds, but your employer is likely to face additional costs from the 401(k) provider itself. These costs range from administrative fees and revenue-sharing fees to consulting and advisory fees. All of these costs reduce the total return provided for employees.\n\nWhen you buy investments in an IRA or a regular taxable account, you can usually invest in almost anything you\u2019d like. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, CDs, gold and commodities are freely available. You might even be able to invest in cryptocurrencies, emerging market bonds, options or master limited partnerships. In a 401(k), however, you\u2019re limited to select asset classes as delineated by your plan. In many cases, you\u2019ll only have access to the most basic choices, such as large-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, investment-grade bonds and Treasury securities. This can be a major drawback since 401(k) plans often comprise the bulk of an investor\u2019s retirement savings.\n\nIn addition to having limited asset classes to invest in, many 401(k) plans also limit the investment choices you have within those asset classes. For example, your 401(k) might offer large-cap, small-cap and foreign-stock buckets, but only one mutual fund option for each. If you want exposure to that asset class you\u2019ll be forced to choose the available fund \u2014 even if it has high expenses and low performance. This is one of the major weaknesses of 401(k) plans in general. While they encourage retirement savings \u2014 which is a definite plus \u2014 you have practically no investment freedom.\n\nWhen you\u2019re an employee, you can choose which funds you want to allocate your 401(k) to but you essentially have no power regarding the administration of the plan itself. That\u2019s because a 401(k) plan is employer-sponsored, meaning you can only participate in one if your employer offers it.\n\nIf your employer wants to change providers, drop or add different funds, eliminate loan provisions or otherwise tinker with the specifics of the plan, you have no say in the matter. You might wake up one day to find that your all-time favorite mutual fund, which held the bulk of your 401(k) assets, is no longer part of your plan.\n\nNot all 401(k) plans have a loan provision, and you should avoid raiding your 401(k) funds, anyway. Even so, it\u2019s still nice to have such a provision built into your plan should an emergency need arise. In most cases, you can borrow up to 50% of your 401(k) value and pay back both principal and interest to your own account within five years or less. But here\u2019s the catch: If you leave your employer for any reason, your plan sponsor might require you to pay back the loan immediately. If you don\u2019t, the amount of the loan might be reported as a taxable distribution. This can cause a serious cash flow problem right when you\u2019re switching jobs \u2014 or, even worse, while you\u2019re in between jobs.\n\nAlthough you might get lucky and find some star performers in your 401(k) lineup, far too many plans feature generic funds that are used to plug asset allocation slots rather than provide outstanding long-term performance. If you need a large-cap fund in your lineup and all you get is an average performer, you\u2019re simply out of luck. You can pile more money into the best-performing fund in the lineup, but then you\u2019ll likely be out of balance when it comes to asset allocation.\n\nStory continues\n\n401(k) vs. Roth 401(k): Which Is Better for Your Retirement Plan?\n\nRecordkeeping May Be Poor\n\nA 401(k) plan is a notoriously complex instrument. Employers must comply with numerous federal regulations in setting up the plan and they might have hundreds or even thousands of employee accounts to establish and maintain. Although many 401(k) providers have streamlined the process, many others struggle with recordkeeping. You might not get the type of complete and thorough information regarding your 401(k) account that you\u2019re accustomed to with other investments or bank accounts.\n\nNot User-Friendly\n\nThe rise of online banking has brought with it a wave of innovation. Boring, clunky websites are now the outlier rather than the norm, as sleek interfaces aim to make banking easy and even fun. Mobile apps have added an enormous level of convenience, as you can now do anything from deposit a check to pay a bill right from your phone. If you\u2019re looking for all of these high-tech features in your 401(k), however, you\u2019re likely to be disappointed. Although there are exceptions \u2014 some plans now allow app access \u2014 many 401(k) plans only let you access your account through an employer website. In most cases, you won\u2019t be able to make or change your contributions or perform other banking functions through a mobile app, either.\n\nHidden Brokerage Costs\n\nMany 401(k) participants view their plans as no-cost, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Employers withhold money from paychecks and deposit it directly into 401(k) accounts, and all of the money seemingly goes to work. One factor that\u2019s missing in the equation is that mutual funds in a 401(k), just like mutual funds outside of a 401(k), have expense ratios. These funds cost money to run, so expenses must be deducted from the returns of the funds. This isn\u2019t anything nefarious, or even anything different than funds outside of retirement plans. But participants still need to be aware of them.\n\n\n\nOrdinary Income Taxation\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks to a 401(k) plan is related to taxes \u2014 even though tax advantages are often cited as among the biggest benefits of a 401(k). It\u2019s true that you can make pretax contributions that grow tax-deferred within the account. But the problem lies when you actually withdraw your money. Everything that comes out of a 401(k) plan is taxed as ordinary income unless it is rolled over into another qualifying plan within a certain amount of time. This is true even if the bulk of your profits have come from capital gains, which is often the case in a 401(k) plan. If you are in one of the higher tax brackets, this means you might end up paying much more than the current capital gains tax rate of 15% when you take money out of your account in the form of a distribution.\n\nIlliquidity\n\nNothing says illiquidity like a 401(k) plan. Can you sell any of your funds at any time? Sure, in most cases. Can you swap money between the funds in your plan whenever you want? Almost certainly. So, how is a 401(k) illiquid? Well, if you want access to your money without fear of penalty \u2014 as in, taking it out so you can carry it in your pocket \u2014 you\u2019re out of luck unless you\u2019re at least 59 1/2, suffer hardship or leave your job.\n\nImagine you\u2019re 20 years old and just starting your first job. This means you might not see the money in your 401(k) for about 40 years. While this is great if you\u2019re trying to build long-term wealth, it\u2019s incredibly restrictive when it comes to liquidity.\n\nLimited Early Withdrawal Options\n\nIf you really, really need to take money out of your 401(k) account, you have limited options. With few exceptions, IRS rules forbid 401(k) distributions unless you reach age 59 1/2, your plan is terminated or you become disabled. You might also be eligible if you are fired from or otherwise leave your job, or if you have a financial hardship. From the perspective of the IRS, financial hardships that are voluntarily incurred or reasonably foreseeable do not qualify. In most cases, even if you can access your money early, you\u2019ll owe not just ordinary income tax on the entire amount but also a 10% early withdrawal penalty. For some participants, this could amount to nearly half their entire distribution.\n\nMay Affect Social Security Taxation\n\nWhen it comes time to begin taking 401(k) distributions, you\u2019ll have to report those withdrawals as ordinary income. By definition, these distributions will raise your total income and might bump you up into a higher tax bracket. If you\u2019re living solely on your Social Security benefits, they are likely 100% tax-free. However, if your 401(k) distributions push you into the middle-income or higher-income categories, up to 85% of your Social Security benefits may become taxable.\n\nMandatory Distributions at 70 1/2\n\nNo matter how much you like your 401(k), at some point, you\u2019ll be required to start taking money out of it. Even if you continue to work at your job, once you reach age 70 1/2 you can no longer make contributions and, in fact, will have to start taking withdrawals. The amount you\u2019ll have to withdraw every year is based on your account balance and your life expectancy. The IRS uses the Uniform Lifetime Table to determine life expectancy. Divide your year-end account balance by your life expectancy in the table and you\u2019ll see the amount you\u2019re required to withdraw. Note that this number will change annually.\n\nNegative Tax Consequences for Surviving Spouse\n\nIf your retirement plan for your spouse is to leave a huge 401(k) behind, be aware of the tax consequences. Assuming you no longer have dependent children at the end of your life, your surviving spouse will have to change their filing status from \u201cmarried filing jointly\u201d to \u201csingle.\u201d This means the 401(k) withdrawals your surviving spouse takes will likely be taxed at a higher rate \u2014 in some cases, much higher.\n\nFor example, as of 2019, if you earn $205,000 as a couple \u2014 including your 401(k) distributions \u2014 you\u2019re taxed at a 24% rate. If you\u2019re single, that rate jumps to 35%. Even on smaller amounts, the jump can be dramatic. If you\u2019re earning $40,000 as a couple you\u2019re in the 12% bracket, but if you\u2019re single, you\u2019ll pay 22%.\n\nThe Ultimate Financial Planning Guide: Do It Like the Pros in 8 Steps\n\nTax Laws May Change\n\nOne of the benefits of a 401(k) plan is that it encourages saving for the long haul. Unfortunately, over a time period of 20, 30, 40 or even 50 years, it\u2019s next to impossible to predict how tax laws will change. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 lowered personal income tax rates across the board, but the next Congress \u2014 or the one after that, or the one after that \u2014 might turn around and raise taxes to all-time highs. This means that contributions made today might get hit hard when it comes time to make a withdrawal. Imagine you\u2019re in the 12% tax bracket today. A $10,000 contribution will generate $1,200 in tax savings. However, if tax rates rise to 25% by the time you retire, you\u2019ll owe $2,500 in taxes on that same contribution.\n\nPurchases Are Made at Regular Intervals\n\nOne of the advantages of a 401(k) plan \u2014 convenience \u2014 is also one of its drawbacks. When you contribute to a 401(k), money is taken out of your paycheck at the same time every month. While it\u2019s nice that you don\u2019t have to put any effort into making contributions (or even think that much about them), it also means you can\u2019t take advantage of large market swings and opportunistically contribute funds at the best possible times. Over the long run your contributions should theoretically average out, but you can\u2019t move your capital in the midst of a market sell-off like you could in a regular taxable account or IRA.\n\nThere May Be Fees If You Change Jobs (or You May Be Kicked Out of Your Plan)\n\nIf you switch jobs, keeping your 401(k) plan might become an issue. In some cases your employer might kick you out of the plan, forcing you to either take it to your new employer or roll it over into an IRA. Other employers might allow you to maintain your 401(k) account, but for a fee. Either way, it\u2019s not likely to be business as usual with your 401(k) plan. Even if you keep your plan at your ex-employer, you won\u2019t be able to make tax-advantaged contributions because you won\u2019t be earning a paycheck there any longer.\n\nCompany Matches May Shrink\n\nAnother great benefit of a 401(k) plan is that your company can match a portion of your contributions. For example, if you contribute 6% of your salary, your company might match half of that. The potential problem is that your employer match can be changed or reduced at any time. If the company falls on hard times, the employer match could be one of the areas that get cut.\n\nYou'll Probably Have To Manage Your Own Investments\n\nWhen you sign up for your 401(k) plan you\u2019ll probably receive written information about investments and might be given a representative to help you understand how the plan works. However, if you want real help planning your retirement, you\u2019ll probably have to work with your own financial advisor or do things yourself. A 401(k) plan is, for the most part, a self-managed investment plan. You\u2019ll have access to information about your account through your employer\u2019s 401(k) website, but you\u2019ll have to pull the trigger yourself when it comes to allocating your investments.\n\n\n\nYour Investments Are Not FDIC-Insured\n\nIf things go wrong in your 401(k), don\u2019t expect the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to step in. The vast majority of 401(k) investments are not FDIC-insured, with the possible exception of certain bank products. Your mutual fund buckets \u2014 including stocks, bonds, precious metals and international securities \u2014 are subject to market fluctuations like any other investment. Just because the plan is offered by your employer and promoted as a long-term retirement plan doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s backed by the kind of insurance that protects bank accounts.\n\nYou May Have To Wait To Participate\n\nIf you\u2019re signing on with a new employer specifically because of its great 401(k) plan, you might be in for a surprise if you expect to take part immediately. Many employers don\u2019t offer a 401(k) plan to employees until the open enrollment period, or until a certain period of time has passed, which might be as long as one year. In the meantime, if you want to contribute to a tax-advantaged retirement account you\u2019ll likely have to stick with an IRA and its contribution limit. As of 2019, that limit was a paltry $6,000 for those younger than 50.\n\n\n\nYou Might Not Become the Millionaire You Think You Will\n\nIn theory, a 401(k) is an easy path to becoming a millionaire. Between the tax advantages granted to contributions and the relatively high contribution cap, workers who contribute regularly and start young enough can easily reach the $1 million threshold through prudent investing. The problem is that reality is not keeping up with the dream. As of 2019, the average 401(k) balance was $103,700, according to Fidelity. Although that\u2019s a sizeable amount, it\u2019s a far cry from the $1 million or more many financial planners say you\u2019ll need to live a reasonably comfortable retirement.\n\nOther Options May Be More Attractive\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that 401(k) plans have many benefits, but at the end of the day, you might do just as well \u2014 or even better \u2014 with a different type of account. The limited investment options in a 401(k) plan might be the biggest culprit, as most don\u2019t allow investments in some of the more speculative areas of the market. Most 401(k) plans also don\u2019t let you invest in individual stocks. While financial advisors don\u2019t usually suggest that you put the bulk of your money into a single stock, a diversified portfolio of hand-picked, high-growth stocks might give you the type of return that you just can\u2019t achieve in your 401(k) plan.\n\nYou Might Not Ever See Your Money\n\nThis is obviously a worst-case scenario, but it\u2019s always possible that you pass away before you have the chance to enjoy the money you\u2019ve invested in your 401(k). Since most 401(k) plans restrict your withdrawals until age 59 1/2, a premature death means your money has been tied up for your entire life without providing you with any real benefit. A disheartening scenario, to be sure \u2014 and one that\u2019s highly unlikely for the vast majority of Americans \u2014 but it is a potential drawback.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: The Downsides of 401(k)s That You\u2019ve Never Heard Of", "description": "To make the most of your 401(k), learn about the bad parts.", "authors": ["John Csiszar"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QKYXCFIjJoj4q67O6_Wg3w--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/gobankingrates_644/84186faf7f73da0660a7be694fc01356", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
