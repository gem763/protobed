And people with psychoses should try to make sense of their symptoms by questioning their doctors and themselves.\n\n\u201cI think if I had depression, I could imagine taking a medication,\u201d Mrs. Buck said in a 2005 interview. \u201cBut in a psychosis, I have to be asked what the psychosis means. If it is important to a human being, it must not be suppressed by medication; there must be talks.\u201d\n\nOr as she famously put it, \u201cAs long as we talk to each other, we don\u2019t kill each other.\u201d\n\nDorothea Sophie Buck-Zerchin was born on April 5, 1917, in Naumburg, near Leipzig, in eastern Germany. She was raised in Oldenburg, near Bremen in the north, and then in a parsonage on Wangerooge, an island in the North Sea, where her father, Hermann, was a pastor. Her mother was Anna (Lahusen) Buck.\n\nBy concealing both her psychiatric history and her forced sterilization, Mrs. Buck was able to enroll in 1942 in a private art school in Frankfurt, where she learned pottery. She worked as a sculptor and taught art from 1969 to 1982 before being overcome by the lingering revelations of mass murder of mental patients by the Nazis, and by what she found to be continuing mishandling of the mentally ill in modern-day Germany.\n\n\u201cThese hidden medical crimes and the unchanged degrading and inhuman German asylums disturbed me deeply, although I could have used my concentration for my artistic work,\u201d she wrote on her website. \u201cAs a sculptor, I lived on public commissions in Hamburg, which could only be gained through competition. When, in 1965, my last bronze objects were placed, I stopped this work. As long as there was no elementary humanity, art seemed less important.\u201d\n\nMrs. Buck wrote a play about the Nazi-era murders of the mentally ill and the disabled, published essays opposing medical research on patients who lack the cognitive ability to grant consent, and gave lectures to promote more humane psychiatry.", "description": "After a forced sterilization at 19, she became first a sculptor and then an advocate for more humane psychiatric care in modern Germany and beyond.", "authors": ["Sam Roberts"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/obituaries/22Buck-obit1/16Buck2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
