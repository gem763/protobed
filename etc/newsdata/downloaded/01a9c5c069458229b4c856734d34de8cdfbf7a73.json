Mr. Romney had to content himself at first with critiquing from the gallery of Republican elders: In a 2016 speech he said, \u201cDonald Trump is a phony, a fraud,\u201d as Mr. Trump was in the process of rolling to the Republican nomination.\n\nSince then, events have conspired to return Mr. Romney back into the dirty coliseum of politics. He reflected on this return while folded into an armchair of his Washington office during another screwy week in the capital . In the past few days the president had, among other things, declared the emoluments clause of the Constitution to be \u201cphony,\u201d compared the impeachment inquiry to a \u201clynching\u201d and dismissed his Republican critics as \u201chuman scum.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of all this, weighty decisions and debates were playing out all through the marbled chambers of Capitol Hill. \u201cI do believe it\u2019s an inflection point in history when a president is impeached,\u201d Mr. Romney said. He has been a persistent critic of the president\u2019s conduct, and therefore perhaps the highest-profile specimen of \u201chuman scum\u201d in Trump, D.C. \u2014 a designation that seems not to trouble him at all.\n\nNow 72, Mr. Romney looks every bit the well-barbered character who was the last presidential nominee of the pre-Trump Republican Party. He has now settled into a hybrid role of sober statesman and maverick in a party struggling to reconcile the oft-irreconcilable impulses of its leader.\n\nThis \u201cFree Mitt\u201d phase has been accompanied by goofy episodes. In an interview with the Atlantic\u2019s McKay Coppins published last weekend, Mr. Romney introduced the concept of \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d into our Crazytown lexicon by oversharing that he maintained a pseudonymous Twitter account \u2014 and thus moving another reporter (Ashley Feinberg of Slate) to discover that the Twitter user going by the name Pierre Delecto was in fact Mr. Romney.", "description": "It\u2019s not how he wanted to get to Washington, but now that he is here the junior senator from Utah is trying to make the most of it.", "authors": ["Mark Leibovich"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/26/us/politics/26romney-01/26romney-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
