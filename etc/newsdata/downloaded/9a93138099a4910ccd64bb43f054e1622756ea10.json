Nita Lowey, the first woman ever to serve as chair of the House Appropriations Committee, announced Thursday that she\u2019s retiring from Congress next year, closing out a 16-term career.\n\nThe respected New York Democrat, a key ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, ascended to the heights of the most powerful committee on Capitol Hill at the beginning of this year, when her party retook control of the House.\n\nShe didn\u2019t give a specific reason for calling it quits, but in a statement announcing her retirement announcement, she did recount those she\u2019s been able to help through her control of taxpayer money, particularly in New York.\n\nShe also pointed to legislation imposing a national drunk-driving blood alcohol content standard of .08 percent and a bill on labeling food to better inform those with allergies as high points of her tenure.\n\n\u201cI am honored that my colleagues in Congress elected me as the first chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee and will fight vigorously for House Democratic priorities as I negotiate spending bills for fiscal years 2020 and 2021,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Lowey\u2019s retirement is noteworthy in part because the party is enjoying its new majority, and few Democrats have announced retirements. Republicans, meanwhile, face another wave of longtime lawmakers heading for the doors.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
