The World Health Organisation estimates that vaccination prevented ten million deaths between 2010 and 2015 alone.\n\nMeasles had been officially eradicated in the UK but, to my dismay, we recently lost our measles-free status.\n\nThe numbers have fallen so low that we are again seeing outbreaks of life-threatening measles, mumps and rubella.\n\nIn some areas, particularly in London, one child in three is not receiving the two jabs necessary for full MMR immunity (pictured the MMR vaccine)\n\nIn some areas, particularly in London, one child in three is not receiving the two jabs necessary for full MMR immunity.\n\nSuch an alarmingly low uptake threatens the \u2018herd immunity\u2019 that protects us all \u2014 especially people in poor health \u2014 from potentially deadly diseases.\n\nThat is why I give the Mail\u2019s campaign my full, unreserved backing.\n\nYou might assume poor vaccine uptake was down to ignorance. But analysis of the data shows something surprising.\n\nSome of the lowest vaccination rates are, in fact, in some of wealthiest regions.\n\nIn Kensington & Chelsea, where the average salary is \u00a3123,000 (the highest in the UK), 33 per cent of children have not received both MMR jabs.\n\nIn Barnsley, South Yorkshire, by contrast, the average salary is \u00a329,700 but 95 per cent of children have been fully vaccinated.\n\nThis suggests that groups of people who are typically highly educated and very much engaged in their families\u2019 health are actively rejecting vaccines.\n\nLet me be blunt: some sections of the well-to-do middle classes seem to be turning their backs on treatments we know save lives.\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nIn Kensington & Chelsea (pictured), where the average salary is \u00a3123,000 (the highest in the UK), 33 per cent of children have not received both MMR jabs\n\nAs a doctor, I\u2019ve noticed a trend among some wealthier patients: a growing sense that they know best when it comes to their own and their children\u2019s health.\n\nSocial media has heightened these beliefs, bombarding people who spend time online with misinformation and, often, lies.\n\nIt is perhaps surprising that well-educated, well-off people seem to be taking such health risks, and I\u2019ve no doubt the parents of Kensington & Chelsea want to care for their children as much as anyone else.\n\nBut the new data clearly shows money doesn\u2019t necessarily matter when it comes to evaluating evidence.\n\n(Other, poorer areas of London, such as Hackney, also have low vaccination rates. In part, this can probably be attributed to higher rates of immigration from countries where vaccination is less widespread.)\n\nWhen I was a medical student, I worked for a time alongside a GP who was about to retire.\n\nHe had the kind of knowledge and experience that can\u2019t be learnt in a lecture or from a medical textbook.\n\nHe told me how, some years previously, he had been holding a vaccination clinic. This was at the height of the hysteria over possible links \u2014 now thoroughly discredited \u2014 between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nTo this day, many parents worry that, despite overwhelming evidence of the tremendous benefits of vaccination, it is still somehow risky.\n\nThe GP had done his best to reassure all his patients, and slowly more parents were having their children immunised.\n\nSocial media has heightened these beliefs about MMR, bombarding people who spend time online with misinformation and, often, lies (stock image)\n\nOne mother, after asking lots of questions, at last agreed for her son to receive the jab.\n\nThe frightened child was crying, so the doctor had put the boy on his knee. He was just about to administer the vaccine when, suddenly, the lad had a seizure.\n\nIt didn\u2019t last long but he was sent to hospital without having been given the vaccine.\n\nAs the GP explained to me, if he had vaccinated the child a minute earlier, the boy would have had the seizure after the vaccine and the mother would, understandably, have been convinced for ever that the vaccine had caused the seizure.\n\nShe would have told every other parent about her experience and it would have caused great worry and lasting upset.\n\nThe moral of all this? We must trust in the science, not simply what we want to think is true.\n\nAnother case I saw as a junior doctor working in A&E illustrated to me the vital importance of vaccination.\n\nA woman came in with her severely disabled son, who had become ill at home and developed a temperature. He was unable to feed himself, so some time ago a tube had been placed permanently into his stomach, through which he was fed.\n\nIt had become infected. I listened, puzzled, as his mother kept saying it was all her fault.\n\nShe explained that the reason her son was severely disabled was because, when he was younger, she had chosen not to have him vaccinated.\n\nShe would regret this decision for the rest of her life.\n\nFor most children, measles, mumps and rubella are merely unpleasant. However, for a small but significant minority, they can lead to permanent disability and damage.\n\nThis woman\u2019s son was particularly unlucky. The infection travelled to his brain \u2014 a condition known as encephalitis. There it lay dormant for a year until, finally, it began to do its terrible damage.\n\nThe boy started to behave strangely and have seizures. He had difficulty moving and speaking. There was no cure.\n\nHis mum was his sole carer and did the job with admirable dedication and love. She had given up her job to care for him.\n\nWhile the fears around MMR and autism turned out to be false, fears around the infections themselves remain \u2014 or should remain \u2014 very real.\n\nIt is therefore vital that children receive the vaccinations they need.", "description": "DR MAX PEMBERTON: In some areas, particularly in London, one child in three is not receiving the two jabs necessary for full MMR immunity.", "authors": ["Dr Max Pemberton For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/00/19563224-0-image-a-37_1570748911834.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
