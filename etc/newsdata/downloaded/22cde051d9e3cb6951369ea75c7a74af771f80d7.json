This included members of Congress. Today, though all congressional representatives earn salaries, not much else has changed.\n\nThe typical congressional representative \u2013 including both senators and House members \u2013 has an estimated net worth of over $500,000, or roughly five times the median U.S. household net worth. The high net worth of American lawmakers is partially attributable to their annual salaries of $174,000, which is more than triple the average wage across all American workers of $51,960 and higher than the median earnings of even the highest paying jobs in America.\n\nStill, the wealthiest congressional representatives did not earn their fortunes as public servants. Many of the wealthiest legislators first had successful and lucrative careers in the private sector. Others, meanwhile, have married into or inherited vast fortunes.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the estimated net worth of U.S. congressional representatives from Roll Call, a Capitol Hill news outlet, to identify the 76 richest members of Congress. Only lawmakers with an estimated net worth of more than $3 million are included on this list.

Net worth figures are based on recent financial filings and are representative of the time that each House member or senator was beginning his or her term in the 115th Congress. Net worth figures are by no means comprehensive or exact, as members of Congress are not required to report their principal residences or their contents (the largest assets for most Americans), and they report their financial assets and liabilities in broad ranges of value. Data on the year each House member or senator started serving as a member of Congress, district served, and party affiliation came from Congress.gov. The year each House member or senator\u2019s current term ends came from nonprofit political encyclopedia Ballotpedia. Only House members and senators currently serving in the 116th congress were considered.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
