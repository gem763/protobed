Will it matter in 2020?", "language": "en", "text": "TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump once promised that coal and steel would be the beating heart of a revived U.S. economy \u2014 a nostalgic vision that helped carry him to victory three years ago in the industrial Midwest.\n\nBut a year away from Election Day, that promised renaissance is not materializing and both sectors are faltering in ways that are painfully familiar and politically significant.\n\nRecent data show manufacturing jobs are disappearing across Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio, all states critical to Trump\u2019s reelection chances. On Tuesday, Murray Energy, a major mining firm with close ties to the president, became the latest of many coal companies to file for bankruptcy this year, rattling communities across Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky. The news followed recent layoffs at a prominent steel manufacturer in northeastern Ohio and General Motors\u2019 final decision this fall to shutter its massive plant at Lordstown, Ohio.\n\nThe turmoil in the manufacturing and mining sectors threatens to undermine Trump\u2019s claim to a booming economy \u2014 the bedrock of his and his Republican allies\u2019 campaign strategy \u2014 in places where it matters most. While Trump\u2019s economy is benefiting high-tech manufacturing and energy sectors in other regions, the manufacturing slump across the Rust Belt may test whether Trump can retain his appeal to blue-collar workers without having fully delivered on his promise to fatten their bank accounts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that Ohio is just a lock in the Republican\u2019s column, nor do I think that blue-collar voters are settled on who they\u2019re likely to select,\u201d said Robert Alexander, a political scientist at Ohio Northern University. \u201cThere is a lot of economic angst still in the state.\u201d\n\nRecent elections haven\u2019t shown that angst to be aimed at Republicans. After Trump won Ohio by 12 percentage points \u2014 the largest margin of any presidential candidate since 1988 \u2014 Republicans fared better in Ohio than in many other states in last year\u2019s midterms, nabbing every statewide office but one. Their winning formula was based overwhelming support from working-class, white voters in small communities where a single company can anchor the local economy.\n\nMurray Energy is based in St. Clairsville, Ohio, a small city near the West Virginia and Pennsylvania borders in a county that voted for Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton by a margin of 40 percentage points. But the company\u2019s footprint is far larger, including 17 mines across Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Utah and West Virginia, as well as Colombia, South America.\n\nThe company\u2019s former CEO Bob Murray is a Trump donor and advocate for his company\u2019s interests. Murray openly pressured Trump to issue an emergency order that would have exempted his struggling company from environmental regulations he said were burdensome. Trump flirted with that idea but never approved it.\n\nMurray said Tuesday the company was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a restructuring that puts at risk the incomes, pensions and health care benefits of roughly 7,000 workers.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy expert, seized on the news as evidence of Trump failing his voters.\n\n\u201cHe made promises to working people all across this country that he would be there on their behalf. Instead he\u2019s been there for the lobbyists, he\u2019s been there for the giant corporations, he\u2019s been there to help make the rich richer and leave everyone else behind,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump bounded into office promising to bring back \u201cbeautiful clean coal\u201d and deliver a victory for every factory worker. The message helped him pull out victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio, where scars from the Great Recession that technically ended in 2009 were still fresh.\n\nFor the first two years of his presidency, Trump oversaw an economic recovery that extended across sectors and regions \u2014 adding manufacturing and factory jobs in the Rust Belt and beyond.\n\nBut recent signs show that trajectory shifting downward quickly, fueled by a slumping global economy and the trade wars escalated by the Trump administration.\n\nSo far this year, Ohio has shed 2,400 factory jobs. Michigan has lost 6,200. Pennsylvania has 9,100 fewer manufacturing workers. West Virginia employers have cut 400 mining jobs. And Kentucky has let go of 600 mine workers.\n\nGeneral Motors struck a devastating blow to Ohio by ending more than 50 years of car manufacturing at assembly plant near Youngstown, a labor stronghold where Trump surprised Democrats by winning half the vote in 2016. But for every GM-scale closure, there are other, lower-profile layoffs in other states.\n\nNearly 950 manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania were lost in May when the cabinetmaker Wood-Mode shuttered. Bimbo Bakeries closed a plant in July in northern Pennsylvania that cost 151 jobs, according to filings with the state.\n\nEarlier this month, Canton, Ohio-based Timken Steel ousted CEO Tim Timken, also a Republican donor, as the company\u2019s stock has plummeted over the past year.\n\nTimken received $4 million in cash as severance. The company eliminated 55 positions in July in order to save $7 million annually next fiscal year, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSeparately, roughly 250 Timken Steel employees so far have received extended layoff notices, said Bob Harper, president of United Steelworkers 1123. Factories have been idled at times due to a lack of orders.\n\nEach job at Timken Steel supports about five other jobs in the community, said Harper, who says he thinks the layoffs could turn voters there against Trump.\n\n\u201cThings are going to get worse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get hurt.\u201d\n\nTimken\u2019s wife is Ohio Republican Party Chairwoman Jane Timken, a chief cheerleader for Trump\u2019s economic stewardship in the state. Asked about the layoffs and Ohio\u2019s economy, Jane Timken issued a statement touting Trump\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is committed to bringing good paying manufacturing jobs back to Ohio and the Midwest,\u201d she said, citing statistics largely shaped by Great Recession layoffs that preceded Trump by seven years. \u201cSince he became president, he has brought over 14,500 manufacturing jobs back to Ohio. Compare that to President Obama who only brought 11,700 manufacturing jobs to Ohio during his entire administration. \u2026 Democrats can cry economic wolf, but Ohioans know the truth.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s far from clear that Ohioans are poised to blame Trump for the economic blows.\n\nIn Ohio, Dan Wade has worked at Timken Steel for the the past 19 years. He was temporarily laid off last week, but says he expects to go back in a few days. He blames the company\u2019s troubles on management, not Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to vote for him again. I like him, I like his attitude,\u201d Wade said.\n\nTimken retiree Joe Hoagland, who didn\u2019t vote Trump and won\u2019t in 2020, said he sees no evidence that Trump has been a boon for manufacturing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any revitalization,\u201d Hoagland said. \u201cWhen you talk about bringing employment back, you can\u2019t just all of a sudden make the happen.\u201d\n\n__\n\nBoak reported from Washington.
