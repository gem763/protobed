(University College London)\n\nIn the dim, red light of an alien sun, scientists have found the first evidence for water in the atmosphere of a \u201csuper Earth\u201d-size planet \u2014 offering a tantalizing (if cryptic) new target in the search for life in the universe.\n\nThe intriguing world, which goes by the impersonal designation K2-18b, lies just 110 light-years away in the constellation Leo. More important: It sits in its star\u2019s \u201chabitable zone,\u201d where it is bathed in the same amount of energy from its star as Earth gets from the sun.\n\nTwice as large as our own planet and eight times as massive, K2-18b possesses powerful gravity that would make it difficult to walk upon. It orbits close to a red dwarf star, much smaller and cooler than our sun. And aside from water vapor, its atmosphere contains mostly hydrogen gas \u2014 a molecule that makes up less than 1 part per million of our own atmosphere.\n\nIt is no \u201csecond Earth,\u201d said astronomer Angelos Tsiaras, the lead author of a study on the planet published Wednesday in the journal Nature Astronomy. But he believes it is \u201cthe best candidate for habitability that we know right now.\u201d\n\nThe paper by Tsiaras draws on publicly available data produced by Bj\u00f6rn Benneke, a planetary astronomer at the University of Montreal in Canada. On Tuesday, Benneke\u2019s team posted its own analysis of K2-18b on the preprint server arXiv, which hosts academic papers not yet published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nBenneke and his colleagues also found signatures of water vapor in K2-18b\u2019s skies. But they were less optimistic than Tsiaras about the potential habitability of this world. The Montreal-based team\u2019s interpretation of its data suggests the hydrogen atmosphere forms a thick, gaseous envelope around the planet. This would generate intense pressures at the planet\u2019s surface \u2014 perhaps enough to push hydrogen into a liquid form.\n\n\u201cIt is not a true Earth analogue,\u201d the researchers report.\n\n[Dear Science: How do scientists find far-off planets?]\n\nLaura Kreidberg, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said that K2-18b might be better described as a \u201cmini-Neptune\u201d than a \u201csuper Earth.\u201d Extensive research with computer models suggests that, at 1.6 to 1.8 times the mass of Earth, planets tend to become huge and gaseous, rather than rocky.\n\nThough K2-18b is likely solid at its core, the temperatures and pressures at the \u201csurface\u201d would be so high that few complex molecules would survive, let alone any life-forms.\n\n\u201cI think the result is amazing,\u201d Kreidberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the smallest and coolest planet that we\u2019ve had a glimpse into the atmosphere of so far. ... But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s potentially habitable.\u201d\n\nScientists have previously detected water only in the atmospheres of \u201cgas giants\u201d \u2014 huge exoplanets that lack solid surfaces, much like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. But rocky exoplanets are smaller, making them harder to find and more difficult to study. Even a \u201cSuper Earth\u201d like K2-18b can be examined only with humanity\u2019s most sensitive space telescope \u2014 the Hubble.\n\nWhen K2-18b was discovered in 2015, Tsiaras and his colleagues thought it would be a good candidate for a form of analysis called transit spectroscopy, which involves studying the changes in a star\u2019s light as a planet \u201ctransits,\u201d or passes in front of it.\n\nThe planet is so close to its cool host star that it takes just 33 days to orbit. So, month after month, the researchers waited with Hubble to capture the moment of transit.\n\nAs the starlight filtered through the planet\u2019s atmosphere, some of it would be absorbed by the gases in the planet\u2019s air. By separating the light into its component parts, the scientists could look for signatures of particular molecules.\n\nWhat they found suggests that the composition of K2-18b\u2019s atmosphere could range from 0.1 percent water vapor (about the proportion in Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere) to a whopping 50 percent. (At its highest, water vapor concentration in Earth\u2019s lower atmosphere is about 4 percent.)\n\nHubble isn\u2019t sensitive to the right types of light to detect other important molecules, such as nitrogen or methane, so the researchers can only speculate about the precise composition of the atmosphere. The planet could have thick clouds, like Venus, that would heat its surface to an intolerable degree. Or its atmosphere might not be substantial enough to offer protection from the perils of space.\n\nResearchers must wait for more sophisticated tools, such as the long-delayed James Webb Space Telescope, to reveal more details about the distant world.\n\nYet Giovanna Tinetti, a colleague of Tsiaras\u2019s at University College London and a co-author of the Nature study, suggested it\u2019s still possible that there is liquid water somewhere below the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need more observations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to know much more about the planet.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nSo long, Kepler, and thanks for all the planets\n\nFound: Another star system with eight planets, just like ours\n\nThere\u2019s a new planet in the neighborhood \u2014 and it looks like a nice place to live", "description": "Scientists have found the first evidence for water in the atmosphere of a \u201csuper Earth\u201d-size planet \u2014 offering a tantalizing (if cryptic) new target in the search for life in the universe.", "authors": ["Sarah Kaplan", "Reporter For Speaking Of Science", "September At Pm", "Sarah Kaplan Is A Science Reporter Covering News Around The Nation", "Across The Universe.
