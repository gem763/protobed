Mandatory Credit: Mark Zerof-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTrask, who entered the game after third-year starter Feleipe Franks dislocated his ankle and was carted off, completed 9 of 13 passes for 126 yards. He also rushed 4 yards for the go-ahead touchdown with 4:11 remaining.\n\nRunning back Lamical Perine cut Florida\u2019s deficit to 21-16 with 12:41 remaining in the game when he scored on an 8-yard run, capping a six-play, 62-yard drive that required just 2:15. Trask put the Gators (3-0) up for good eight minutes later.\n\nKentucky (2-1), which dominated the first three quarters, had a chance to retake the lead late when the Wildcats marched 58 yards to set up a 35-yard field-goal attempt with 33 seconds remaining. But Chance Poore\u2019s kick sailed wide right, and Josh Hammond put the game away with a 76-yard rushing touchdown.\n\nNo. 1 Clemson 41, Syracuse 6\n\nSophomore quarterback Trevor Lawrence passed for three touchdowns and ran for a fourth as the Tigers extended the nation\u2019s longest active winning streak to 18 games with a victory over the Orange at the Carrier Dome.\n\nDespite being intercepted twice, Lawrence completed 22 of 39 passes for a career-high 395 yards, hitting Amari Rodgers for touchdowns of 16 and 87 yards.\n\nClemson (3-0, 2-0 ACC) has not lost an ACC game since a 27-24 setback against Syracuse at the Carrier Dome on Oct. 13, 2017.

The Oklahoma drive officially went 89 yards, but a holding penalty provided the nation\u2019s fifth-ranked player in total offense coming into Saturday with an opportunity to further pad his lofty stats.\n\nWith Hurts clicking, the Sooners (3-0) scored on every first-half possession en route to a 34-7 halftime advantage. Hurts found Charleston Rambo and CeeDee Lamb on scoring passes of 48 and 39 yards, respectively, and Lamb finished a short, 36-yard drive just before intermission with a 1-yard rush.\n\nNo. 6 Ohio State 51, Indiana 10\n\nSophomore quarterback Justin Fields passed for 199 yards and three touchdowns as the Buckeyes dominated in all phases in a win over the Hoosiers in Bloomington, Ind.\n\nJunior running back J.K.

Texas has now defeated Rice in 42 of 43 meetings since 1966.\n\nEhlinger connected on 23 of his 27 throws without an interception (he\u2019s still without one for the season), and did not get sacked. Tom Stewart passed for 179 yards and two fourth-quarter touchdowns to lead Rice (0-3), but the Owls were never in the game.\n\nNo. 13 Penn State 17, Pitt 10\n\nTrue freshman Devyn Ford and Noah Cain each rushed for one touchdown to lift the Nittany Lions over the Panthers in University Park in the 100th meeting between the programs.\n\nPenn State quarterback Sean Clifford was 14 of 30 for 222 yards.

Freshman quarterback Jayden Daniels dropped back to pass but took off running with a wide-open field in front of him, picking up 15. Four plays later, the Sun Devils (3-0) were in the end zone.\n\nMichigan State (2-1) appeared to tie the game in the final seconds on a 42-yard field goal from junior kicker Matt Coghlin, but the Spartans were flagged for too many men on the field. His 47-yarder as time expired went wide left. The loss kept Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio from becoming the winningest coach in program history.\n\nNo. 19 Iowa 18, Iowa State 17\n\nKeith Duncan kicked four field goals, including the go-ahead boot inside the final five minutes, to lead the Hawkeyes past the host Cyclones in a game delayed twice by lightning in Ames, Iowa.\n\nAfter Duncan\u2019s 39-yard kick gave Iowa the lead at 4:51 \u2014 the third lead change of the fourth quarter \u2014 the Hawkeyes forced a turnover on downs and recovered a muffed punt at 1:29 to preserve the win.\n\nNate Stanley rushed for a score and passed for 201 yards for Iowa (3-0), which won for the fifth straight time and the sixth in seven games over Iowa State (1-1), improving to 45-22 in the series.\n\nTemple 20, No. 21 Maryland 17\n\nThe Owls put the clamps on the Terrapins and their high-scoring offense in an upset in Philadelphia.\n\nMaryland (2-1) entered the game averaging 71 points, and Temple (2-0) scored 56 in its win over Bucknell.\n\nBut Temple\u2019s defense stole the show, holding Maryland without an offensive score in the first half, also recording four sacks and stopping the Terrapins twice in the final minutes on fourth-down attempts deep in Temple territory.\n\nNo. 22 Boise State 45, Portland State 10\n\nJohn Hightower caught a touchdown pass and returned a kickoff for another score to help the host Broncos paste the FCS Vikings in a non-conference mismatch.\n\nCurtis Weaver recorded four sacks for Boise State (3-0) to match the school\u2019s single-game record.

But he threw three interceptions, the first two of which led to 10 BYU points in the first half.\n\nNo. 25 Virginia 31, Florida State 24\n\nWayne Taulapapa rushed for two of his three touchdowns late in the fourth quarter to rally the Cavaliers to just their fourth win in 19 meetings with the Seminoles, as host Virginia improved to 3-0 for the first time since 2005.\n\nJames Blackman passed for 234 yards and three touchdowns and had Florida State (1-2, 0-1 ACC) in front 24-17 in the fourth quarter before another defensive collapse.
