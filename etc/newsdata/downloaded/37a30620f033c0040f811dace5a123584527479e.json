The broad aim is to pinpoint successes and failures in treatment and encourage states \u2013 and donors \u2013 to invest in what works best to deal with illnesses that afflict hundreds of millions of people.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shekhar Saxena, a Harvard professor leading the new data drive Photograph: Amal KS/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to mental health, all countries are developing countries,\u201d said Shekhar Saxena, a Harvard professor who is leading the project in conjunction with the World Health Organization, the Lancet and other civil society NGOs.\n\n\u201cThere will be comparisons across countries and across time,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to measure how much progress we have made, and establish how we allocate resources.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that information on the mental health of nations is patchy, unreliable and hard to compare from one country to the next, making it difficult to set targets. There are no blood tests or X-rays that identify these types of illnesses, and much of the data rests on self-reporting or extrapolation of surveys.\n\nMental illness: is there really a global epidemic?

But many poorer countries do not.\n\nAdditionally, the WHO collects information on services available in each country \u2013 the Mental Health Atlas \u2013 but here there are also big gaps.\n\nD\u00e9vora Kestel, the WHO director of mental health and substance abuse, says the aim is a \u201cmore real mapping of the situation\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that many countries are not even aware of the mental health burden in their population. So we need a stronger argument. If they do things that are doable in terms of funding they will be able to improve the mental health of the population \u2013 and also the economy of the country.\u201d\n\nThe countdown metric is being unveiled at the \u201cGoalkeepers\u201d summit on the sidelines of the UN general assembly. Kestel said that if mental health needs were more accurately pinpointed it would help donors make more judicious investments to improve global mental health outcomes.\n\nPeople, heal thyselves: Nigeria's new mental illness approach Read more\n\nVictor Ugo, a Nigerian who set up a mental health self-help group in Nigeria because of the lack of services and treatments, said a clearer picture of the prevalence of illness \u2013 and the shortcomings of treatment \u2013 could spur the authorities into better responses.\n\n\u201cThis will mean that we can see where we are \u2013 with data, policies and programmes and funding within the African states. That will help us demand better accountability and better systems.\u201d", "description": "Countries will be assessed on successes and failures in bid to identify effective treatments and improve sketchy data on depression and anxiety", "authors": ["Mark Rice-Oxley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f923ac53d8d4f48972b916c2ff164c51ff0a83df/170_0_4998_3000/master/4998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=81aa31da45cbbe7f7be9d2398febb1d5", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
