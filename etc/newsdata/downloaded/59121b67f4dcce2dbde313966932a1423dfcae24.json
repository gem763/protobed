According to experts who have studied the problem, Teslas are writing vehicle logs to this flash storage chip so much that it eventually goes bad. The issue has been known in the Tesla community since at least May, when Tesla repair YouTuber Rich Benoit spoke to another Tesla repair professional named Phil Sadow about it in a video.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s got a problem. They create so many logs in the car, they write to [the chip] so fast that it basically burns them out. They have a finite amount of writes,\u201d Sadow said in the video. \u201cWhen this burns out, you wake up to a black screen [in the car\u2019s center console.] There\u2019s nothing there. No climate control. You can generally drive the car, but it won\u2019t charge.\u201d\n\nSadow suggested that this begins to happen after about four years of driving, though it can vary. Many Tesla owners still haven\u2019t seen the issue, while others have posted on message boards about it happening on a quicker timeline. Tom's Hardware previously reported on the issue.\n\nThe issue highlights the fact that Tesla is not bound by the same rules when it comes to repair as other auto manufacturers. Tesla is not party to a memorandum of understanding signed by other auto manufacturers in 2014, in which they agreed to sell parts to independent repair shops.\n\nAs a result, there are very few independent Tesla repair professionals, acquiring parts to repair Teslas is very difficult, and finding or making aftermarket parts is also difficult. Many parts used by independent repair professionals are salvaged from wrecked Teslas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building these parts in the aftermarket because Tesla won\u2019t sell these parts,\u201d Sadow said.\n\nSince making that video in May, Benoit has also seen the memory problem at his own repair shop.\n\n\u201cI see it in the wild,\u201d he told Motherboard. \u201cI own a shop that repairs these cars and the older vehicles are starting to show their signs of age.\u201d\n\nBenoit said he has a cache of replacement boards that he\u2019s obtained from wrecked Teslas \u201cjust in case\u201d he decides to start doing these repairs.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we do not provide this service as we would like to form a partnership with Tesla to help them resolve these issues,\u201d he said.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted at an independent repair professional named Jason Hughes who said he has dealt with \u201cover a dozen\u201d broken MCU1s in the last month. \u201cIt\u2019s literally killing a huge percentage of these units,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nMusk tweeted that the issue \u201cshould be much better at this point,\u201d but did not elaborate about what changes\u2014if any\u2014his company had made in recent weeks to fix the issue.", "description": "\"When this burns out, you wake up to a black screen.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da603039ba232000aa3c6a4/lede/1571161085410-GettyImages-1173565648.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8439609902475619xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
