Meanwhile, gun control advocates haven\u2019t gotten in the door.\n\nPresident Donald Trump talked about expanding background checks, then wavered. He was considering a \u201cred flag\u201d bill to let authorities take guns away from dangerous people, but has now \u201ccooled\u201d on the prospect, according to three people involved in the discussions.\n\nThe whole time, the gun rights lobby was there to nudge the president along. Advocates bombarded the White House with calls and petitions. Representatives scored meetings with senior officials. And the industry even has a former staffer working in the West Wing on legislation. Meanwhile, groups pushing for more restrictions on gun purchases haven\u2019t been able to get in the door.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s an all-of-the-above strategy that is helping to shape the package of gun proposals that Trump is expected to release soon. In addition to possible changes to the background check system, Trump will likely include gun lobby-approved offerings meant to address violent video games and mental health treatment, according to several people familiar with the situation. The red flag bill \u2014 a so-called compromise proposal pushed by the president\u2019s ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, but opposed by the gun industry \u2014 may not make the cut.\n\nOn Thursday night, Trump uttered the words the gun lobby wanted to hear.\n\n\u201cDemocrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans,\u201d he told House Republicans at their retreat. \u201cRepublicans will always uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms.\u201d He received a standing ovation.\n\nTo those who have been pushing Trump to buck the gun lobby, including the powerful but scandal-plagued National Rifle Association, it\u2019s a disappointing development. They say the gun rights groups have caused Trump to lose his momentum to act following a pair of back-to-back mass shootings in August that left many Americans asking for solutions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning even more information about just how far the NRA has sunk its claws into this White House,\u201d Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a vice chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force told POLITICO. \u201cThe American people deserve better than a president who\u2019s bought and paid for by the gun lobby.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

As the White House staff in recent weeks developed its list of policy options for Trump, it conferred primarily with gun rights advocates who oppose further restrictions on firearms purchases.\n\nThose advocates also have a conduit in the White House in Michael Williams, who worked for the gun rights lobby before being hired as a counselor to acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nWilliams has attended some of the meetings with guns rights representatives and worked alongside White House legislative staff to develop proposals, according to several people familiar with the situation. He has also been in contact with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the group representing the gun industry, including manufacturers, distributors and retailers.\n\nWilliams is a former law clerk for the NRA\u2019s lobbying arm who later served as general counsel for the American Suppressor Association, an industry group pushing to make the purchase of suppressors \u2014 more commonly known as silencers \u2014 easier and cheaper. His brother, Knox Williams, serves as the association\u2019s president and executive director.\n\nThose who oppose additional firearm restrictions say Williams understands their views and can represent them within the White House.\n\n\u201cI think our point of view is being considered,\u201d one person said\n\nBut not everyone is happy he\u2019s there.\n\n\u201cWe have different positions and a difference of opinion,\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said of Williams. \u201cWe just have differences, let\u2019s put it that way, and the president is very much aware of that.\u201d\n\nManchin wants the White House to back a bipartisan proposal \u2014 which he developed with Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) \u2014 to expand background checks for sales at gun shows and online. They expect to speak to Trump again Thursday.\n\nThe White House supported Williams.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of practice, the White House employs qualified staff with subject matter expertise to work on policy issues \u2014 this is a good thing,\u201d a White House official said. \u201cMichael is part of a very large team of White House staff engaging with members of Congress and their staffs on this important issue.\u201d\n\nTrump is also hearing regularly from the NRA, despite its leadership turmoil and internal strife over executive spending and its finances. While the tumult has left the NRA unable to engage as aggressively in grassroots lobbying, it can still lean on one-one-one conversations.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has spoken to NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre several times. And Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son and an avid hunter who was asked to head up his father\u2019s Second Amendment Coalition advisory group when he won the election, has stayed in contact with Chris Cox, the NRA\u2019s powerful former top lobbyist who left the organization earlier this year.\n\n\u201cIt is really hard to believe the president is going to take action when he\u2019s on the phone with Wayne LaPierre, not Gabby Giffords,\u201d said Robin Lloyd, managing director of Giffords, a group founded to promote gun control legislation after the former congresswoman was shot and wounded.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the NRA that is getting face time with White House officials.\n\nThe Citizens Committee for the Rights to Keep and Bear Arms and Gun Owners of America have both had meetings at the White House, according to the groups. The National Shooting Sports Foundation has spoken several times to White House officials both on the phone and in person.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

The National Association for Gun Rights delivered petitions with 100,000 signatures from people opposing new gun restrictions, according to the group.\n\nThose wanting Trump to push for more stringent measures are disappointed at the White House\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that he\u2019s only interested in hearing from one side,\u201d said Christian Heyne, vice president of policy for Brady, a group that supports increased firearms restrictions and has not been invited to the White House. Heyne said the selective strategy prevents \u201ca fair and balanced approach.\u201d\n\nAfter the February 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., Trump had talked of supporting more gun control, including expanding background checks and implementing the \u201cred flag\u201d law. But he backed down amid opposition from the NRA and fellow Republicans.\n\nAt times, Trump has appeared open to widening background checks, but at other times, he has stressed the country's \u201cvery strong background checks\u201c and the need to focus on mental health treatment.\n\nTrump insists the NRA isn\u2019t influencing his decisions, but his comments over the last few weeks have confused lawmakers and advocates on both sides of the issue.\n\nThe president has a difficult political calculus to consider: pleasing his conservative base that opposes more gun control versus attracting moderate voters who favor new measures.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the discussions, Trump is considering several proposals that Democrats consider too weak, including requiring the FBI to notify local authorities when a potential buyer fails a background check; strengthening the penalties against so-called straw purchasers, or people who buy guns for those who can\u2019t legally buy weapons; and banning people on a terrorism watch list from buying guns.\n\nThe gun industry is optimistic that the final offerings will be to their liking, given the changes they have already seen, even if it still opposes many of Trump\u2019s potential firearm proposals.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re realizing this is a problem with their base,\u201d said Dudley Brown, president of the National Association for Gun Rights. \u201cThat\u2019s the No. 1 way to lose an election.\u201d\n\nDaniel Lippman and Burgess Everett contributed to this report.", "description": "Advocates bombarded officials with petitions, scored meetings and used an ex-gun lobby official as a conduit.
