Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s nominating process for its 2020 candidate is shaping up to be a lollapalooza or a shitshow, depending on your faith in overcrowded acts of political theater. The sheer volume of candidates who have announced their bids, launched exploratory committees, or vaguely mentioned to some friends at a party that it might be fun to ride around in a motorcade and pardon turkeys is immense. We\u2019ve all been subjected to three rounds of Democratic debates already, full of high-school Spanish and sundry Marianne-isms, with a fourth scheduled for October. Front-runners have emerged, but there\u2019s still a vast sea of Tim Ryans out there to try and keep straight.\n\nSo what\u2019s a national, weekly, late-night variety show to do with all of this information? Vulture writers and editors pitched in our best guesses as to which candidate will be played by which Saturday Night Live cast member \u2014 and given that SNL has been packing its cold opens with more and more star power, we\u2019ve speculated about which names SNL might reach out to first. The show has already brought Jason Sudeikis to reprise his handsy Uncle Joe Biden. Given the sheer size of the field, it\u2019s hard to know which candidates will get significant airtime, so we\u2019ve picked the personalities likely to make the writers giggle. (We will update this post as new candidates announce their presidential runs.)\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: Pretty, pretty, pretty slim chance.\n\nCeleb: Larry David is Bernie Sanders. Or, maybe, Larry David is Bernie Sanders as Larry David. David\u2019s self-aware impression during the long run-up to the 2016 election (including SNL\u2019s crossover parody, \u201cBern Your Enthusiasm\u201d) all but cemented their strange twin act. If SNL tried to cast someone else, no doubt there would be a Curb episode featuring the pair of curmudgeonly old dudes grousing about it.\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: Okay, so this one\u2019s a gimme. Kate McKinnon has whipped up a menagerie of characters while at SNL and executed a number of canny impressions of both men and women in politics. Some are accurate (see Hillary Clinton), some are bananas (see Jeff Sessions), and all are entertaining. She has already played Warren on \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d endowing her with a folksy tenacity while nailing that subtle lilt of a mostly dormant Southern accent. As a front-runner, Warren is going to be a big part of the nomination process, so McKinnon\u2019s sure to regain the screen time she lost when Clinton slipped out of sight.\n\nCeleb: The only way to replace a beloved SNL cast member is with a beloved SNL cast member. While never a ferocious impressionist, one of the original Not Ready for Prime Time Players Jane Curtin has the look and wry delivery that would make her a great Warren backup. Curtin was also trending on New Year\u2019s Eve for an expressed interest in ending the Republican Party, so there\u2019s some fun crossover there, too.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: Better luck next time, fellas. There\u2019s no way it won\u2019t stay Jason Sudeikis, short of Olivia Wilde forbidding him.\n\nCeleb: You just know Biden himself is going to make a hokey cold-open appearance. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: Now that Leslie Jones is gone, SNL might tap featured player Ego Nwodim, who hasn\u2019t had an excessive amount of screen time, but she\u2019d surely have to prove herself a doppelg\u00e4nger for the California senator.\n\nCeleb: There\u2019s a few celebrities that might make for a good Harris, and yet another SNL alum comes to mind: Maya Rudolph. Rudolph could certainly bind the former prosecutor\u2019s evil eye and grander oratory style into a formidable impersonation.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: With Beto O\u2019Rourke a decent possibility and one of the more interesting characters in the lineup, surely Alex Moffat is somewhere now practicing his O\u2019Rourke in the mirror. There\u2019s a decent visual similarity, but I mean, come on, a guy who wears a flower-print frock on his old punk band\u2019s album cover? A man who drives cross-country and writes sad blogs after losing the election to Ted Cruz? It\u2019s an impression that lends itself to a number of possibilities, and Moffat could have a star turn if O\u2019Rourke picks up momentum.\n\nCeleb: Fellow Texan Matthew McConaughey will naturally be the one to step in for any SNL cast members. Something about their laid-back manner of comportment \u2014 Beto himself tweeted a photo of himself with McConaughey with the caption, \u201cWhen bae\u2019s feelin alright alright alright\u201d \u2014 is an indication that the McConaughey magic would suit O\u2019Rourke fine.\n\nCory Booker\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: Though it was only a small part in a big sketch, Chris Redd played Cory Booker in what could be his first ongoing political SNL impression during the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. In a 13-minute sketch filled with characters that SNL hadn\u2019t ever featured, Redd\u2019s appearance is but one line and a bit of mugging. (Booker refuses to dignify the Kavanaugh hearings with words, instead providing a disapproving pout and head shake that he calls \u201cthe Booker look.\u201d) It isn\u2019t enough time to see if he\u2019s got Booker\u2019s emphatic patter down, but Redd certainly has the simmering, wide-eyed intensity to make it work.\n\nCeleb: Redd will probably get the shot, but if not, maybe Donald Glover, because he understands sketch and he\u2019s Donald Glover? Keegan-Michael Key has the driving energy and angular, clean-shaven look, plus he\u2019s already at work on a Booker impression \u2014 something he hinted at when he was on Larry King.\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: When looking directly at current cast members, the best pick for this outwardly pleasant, midwestern centrist would be Aidy Bryant. Surely with Bryant\u2019s endearing smile and sweet, ingratiating demeanor, she\u2019s already halfway there. Who would be better standing in front of a podium, turning into a snowwoman while trying to give a speech? SNL will also play on Klobuchar\u2019s reported terrorizing of employees behind the scenes, and it\u2019d be nice to see a blast of Bryant\u2019s nasty side.\n\nCeleb: In the aforementioned Kavanaugh sketch, Klobuchar was played by SNL alum Rachel Dratch, who looked the part and got the stamp of approval from Klobuchar herself. If there is going to be a recurring role from an outside, former cast member, it would be wonderful if it were Dratch. She\u2019s underutilized on TV these days.\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: As the longtime L.A. spiritual guru of choice for a certain celebrity set, including Oprah, Williamson (and her candidacy) will prove irresistible to SNL writers. Recently announced SNL newcomer Chloe Fineman is a very, very talented impressionist, and she\u2019s coming into the show with a spot-on Williamson all ready to go. When Williamson ran for Congress in 2014, she said, \u201cIf everyone with a yoga mat in this district voted for me, I\u2019d win.\u201d These sorts of telling, offhanded quotes convince us that Fineman would have a lot of fun playing Williamson.\n\nCeleb: Tina Fey must be happy with her track record of political impressions \u2014 or, more to the point, she must be proud of her influential and lasting take on then-vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. This part would be a bit sillier and present lower stakes for Fey \u2014 and Williamson\u2019s chance of making it past the primaries isn\u2019t all that good \u2014 but if Fey felt it was time to toy with another inexperienced political hopeful, this would be a good one.\n\nTulsi Gabbard\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: The congresswoman and Army vet from Hawaii is not the most animated of the candidates, but she has grabbed her fair share of headlines. A Samoan-American Hindu often pegged as an Assad sympathizer, Gabbard maintains a pretty unflappable and stoic exterior, regardless of circumstance. Presuming that SNL finds some time for her onstage, her steady monotone might be replicated by either Cecily Strong or Melissa Villase\u00f1or.\n\nCeleb: Seeing as the stage could be nearly full of SNL cast members, it would be nice to see casting directors bring Nasim Pedrad back to try on Gabbard. Given the levels Pedrad brought to Arianna Huffington, surely she\u2019d be able to find some nuance here.\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nPhoto: Getty Images and Shutterstock\n\nCast: The current mayor of South Bend is a notable candidate for a number of reasons: He\u2019s young, he\u2019s a vet, and he\u2019s openly gay. While these details might rattle the Establishment, his onscreen personality is sweet and soft-spoken. If nothing else than the fact that he\u2019s baby-faced, can look into the camera while nodding pleasantly, and shares the same first name, Pete Davidson will probably be the one to take on Buttigieg. If and when Buttigieg gets a little more traction, it\u2019ll be fun to see whether Davidson can craft a full-fledged impression.\n\nCeleb: SNL may also call on another baby face, John Mulaney. He\u2019s been back at 8H more and more since he left his writing gig there, and as a performer more often than not. Mulaney, who once joked that he was \u201cjust sitting in a room on a chair eating saltines\u201d every day before popping onstage, might be the perfect pick for a candidate with such a gentle exterior. Given that Mulaney and Davidson are buddies, maybe they can take turns playing Buttigieg.\n\nJohn Delaney\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: For this Maryland representative who looks like a goofy uncle about to whip out his best Elmer Fudd routine, SNL will need someone who can go a little cartoonish. Of the current cast, Mikey Day is that guy. Slap a balding wig on him and let him go.\n\nCeleb: Delaney already looks a bit like Will Ferrell\u2019s wide-eyed and silly characters, such as Harry Caray, so there\u2019s that. If SNL wanted to give Delaney an over-the-top treatment for contrast, Ferrell could make that happen in his sleep.\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: SNL recently announced that writer Bowen Yang will be joining the cast this season, and we think the Las Culturistas co-host would be great at playing this thoughtful entrepreneur. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Andrew Yang appears to be something of an Andrew Lloyd Webber head, and Bowen has hosted entire episodes of his podcast centered around Cats.\n\nCeleb: Yang\u2019s parents are Taiwanese and Randall Park\u2019s are Korean; still, Park has the makings of a great Yang. As his cheerful, dorky dad in Fresh Off the Boat shows, Park can do straitlaced and silly; a balance of both will be necessary in creating an impression of this political outsider who jokes that he is \u201cthe opposite of Donald Trump \u2014 an Asian man who likes math.\u201d\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: As the only Latinx cast member, it\u2019s nearly an obligation to put Melissa Villase\u00f1or in drag to play this former San Antonio mayor and Obama\u2019s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. It just so happens that this is also an excellent idea. Villase\u00f1or is an incredibly versatile and canny impressionist who will no doubt find the straight-faced Castro\u2019s hook.\n\nCeleb: The Rock. Why not? SNL often hopes that any given celebrity will raise the status of the cold open and the show in general, so maybe they\u2019ll offer Castro up to Dwayne Johnson\u2019s abs.\n\nTom Steyer\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: Tom Steyer is concerned about the \u201ccorporate takeover of government.\u201d He wants to \u201creturn power to the people\u201d and thinks he is the man to do it. He\u2019s also a literal billionaire. This sort of kooky, illogical wrongperson (one word) is tailor-made for Heidi Gardner, who excels at walking enigmas like the Bad-Taco-Math-Surgeon or teen YouTube film reviewer Bailey Gismert. Just wacky enough to play a billionaire who thinks it\u2019s okay to be a billionaire in 2019!\n\nCeleb: Alan Ruck, a.k.a. Cameron from Ferris Bueller, a.k.a. Hubble from Bunheads, a.k.a. Connor Roy himself, would make a great Steyer, who\u2019s not exactly the sort of high-profile candidate you can saddle an A-list guest with.\n\nMichael Bennet\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: Much like casting Bowen Yang as Andrew Yang, we defer to name-math here, which makes Beck Bennett the obvious choice for his last name-sake. Not to mention, Bennett excels at playing confident suits.\n\nCeleb: Just look at that shmooshy face. Just listen to that froggy voice. Just watch this interview where he talks about Jell-O. We think John C. Reilly would do a bang-up job portraying the Mr. Cellophane of candidates.\n\nSteve Bullock\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: Look, we never thought we\u2019d say this, but \u2026 we\u2019re running out of white dudes on SNL. We have to start double-dipping. Let Alex Moffat play the Montanan presidential hopeful on the off chance they need him as meat in the room in a political sketch.\n\nCeleb: How rude would it be to bring on a celebrity guest, only to have them play Steve Bullock? Why would they do that? That being said, Dennis Quaid.\n\nTim Ryan\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: Beck Bennett again!\n\nCeleb: Fellow Tim, I Think You Should Leave\u2019s Tim Robinson, can play this thumb-man.\n\nJoe Sestak\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: Kyle Mooney is eerily good at playing reedy afterthoughts, so Sestak will be right in his wheelhouse.\n\nCeleb: Zach Woods in a wig, I say!\n\nThe Dropouts\n\nA few of our predictions have already been knocked out of the running by dropping out of the race. As the campaign season narrows down, we\u2019ll move the leftovers here just in case SNL decides there\u2019s a reason for a, uh, Jay Inslee appearance.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: The latest addition to the field just finished two terms as governor of Colorado and will be appealing to centrist Dems with a track record of business-minded policies. Again, there\u2019s not enough that\u2019s odd or unusual about him to guarantee he\u2019ll make it into an SNL cold open. If he does make it, the erstwhile brewmaster feels like a strong possibility for Alex Moffat.\n\nCeleb: As the world of Donald Trump implodes, it\u2019s likely that Steve Martin will be back on to play Roger Stone, as he did in January. But so long as SNL has a line out to its brightest honorary cast member, he may as well be back to play this friendly, silver-haired white guy.\n\nJay Inslee\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: Former member of Congress and current Washington governor Jay Inslee is running on a one-issue platform: climate change. Inslee\u2019s personality, pleasant though it may seem, won\u2019t be enough to get him airtime; if SNL decides to put him onstage, it\u2019ll likely be to lean into this issue. As far as who would play him, it could fall to Kyle Mooney or Mikey Day, depending on which party doesn\u2019t already have his hands full playing someone else.\n\nCeleb: Tom Hanks, in his stoic-yet-still-warm Sully mode. If Inslee is just a blip on the electoral radar, it\u2019ll be easy because they\u2019ll just need to borrow America\u2019s everyman for 30 minutes on a Saturday night.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nCast: To date, Heidi Gardner\u2019s characters have proven her a subtle observer of physical tics and social trends. While she has great takes on personalities such as Allison Janney and Kristen Schaal, her best work on SNL revolves around characters she invents, e.g. Angel, Every Boxer\u2019s Girlfriend From Every Boxing Movie Ever. Gardner will have a chance to prove her chops in the political arena if and when she gets assigned the role of Kirsten Gillibrand. It\u2019s not a perfect physical match, but it makes enough sense given the current cast. And it\u2019d be interesting to see Gardner take on the proud mom with the distant and sometimes artificial smile.\n\nCeleb: Amy Poehler did a great ambitious and robotic Clinton, and Gillibrand will be the Clinton of the 2020 election. If Poehler is in town, she\u2019d be a great backup.", "description": "Our predictions of who \u201cSNL\u201d might cast to play the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Elizabeth Warren, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Mayor Pete, and Cory Booker.", "authors": ["Matthew Love", "Rebecca Alter"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/03/04/snl-presidential-predictions/elizabeth-waren-kate-mckinon.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
