It could be a tricky situation to negotiate for Wales, as Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe is to host a formal dinner in their hotel.\n\nJapan will come to a standstill as Emperor Naruhito takes over from his father Akihito\n\nWarren Gatland was an hour late to his press conference on Monday because of the traffic in Tokyo.\n\nHe said: 'We had to come in a separate entrance. There is security with metal detectors. We don't know how our bus is going to get in and out in the next couple of days.'\n\nAt least they might be able to meet the Prince of Wales, who will be here for the event.\n\nWhat a shame that Japan's final press conference on Sunday was so secretive. The JRFU did not widely publicise an event with the squad who have lit up the tournament, and because it was not an official World Cup media session not even the tournament's news service journalists knew to attend.\n\nIt was a PR own goal that the world's media could not celebrate and report on the Brave Blossoms' tournament for the final time.\n\nJapan scored a PR own goal by not publicising their final World Cup press conference\n\nWales were welcomed back to their hotel near Beppu after their last-gasp win over France to a rapturous reception.\n\nHordes of fans were also in the hotel, and lined up to clap the players in - singing the national anthem in perfect drunken harmony too, with Josh Navidi's barber brother leading the celebrations.\n\nAll Blacks lock Brodie Retallick got shirty on Monday when he was asked if he has learned the names of England's players since his gaffe in 2014. Retallick was accused of ignorance when, five years ago, he was unable to name any of England's team during their summer tour.\n\nRetallick even referred to his opposite man Courtney Lawes as 'Michael Lawes'.\n\nAsked if that was still the case, a stone-faced Retallick replied: 'Is that supposed to be humorous? I made a mistake, called them the wrong name, the name of a New Zealand politician. Good on you.'", "description": "WORLD CUP DIARY: All Blacks lock Brodie Retallick got shirty on Monday when he was asked if he has learned the names of England's players since his gaffe in 2014.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/21/20007290-0-image-a-46_1571690272740.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
