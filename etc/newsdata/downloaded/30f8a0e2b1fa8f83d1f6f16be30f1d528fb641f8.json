It was unclear, however, if this was the motive for his killing.\n\nHe is the third Haitian journalist killed in less than two years. The Radio Sans Fin reporter P\u00e9tion Rospide was fatally shot in June as he drove home, while the freelance journalist Vladjimir Legagneur disappeared in March 2018 while working on a story.\n\nThe Association of Professional Journalists of Artibonite asked justice officials to investigate the killing.\n\n\u201cThe press should not have to claim victims and bodies as their own,\u201d the group said.\n\nHaiti: photojournalist shot in face as senator opens fire outside parliament Read more\n\nLast month a photojournalist was shot in the face by a Haitian senator who opened fire outside the country\u2019s parliament. Chery Dieu-Nalio, an Associated Press photographer, was wounded in the face and a second man was also injured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very serious situation,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis, a former prime minister with the non-governmental organisation Fokal. \u201cNo one is really talking about the suffering of the people. The consequences are terrible.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Mo\u00efse announced the creation of a commission charged with finding a solution to end the worsening crisis, but opposition leaders have rejected his call for dialogue and unity. The opposition says it wants Mo\u00efse to step down as anger over corruption, rising inflation and lack of basic goods including fuel continue to roil Haiti.", "description": "Killing of N\u00e9h\u00e9mie Joseph throws fresh fuel on crisis as protesters demand Jovenel Mo\u00efse\u2019s resignation", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5de73793dfe8625849a6e93e6dc9f0193d3a0035/0_111_2131_1279/master/2131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4943a2b0717eec71f35f062ace2c523f", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
