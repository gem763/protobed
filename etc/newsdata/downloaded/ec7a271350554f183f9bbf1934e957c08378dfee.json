We were grateful that they didn\u2019t mess around and went right in,\u201d Ms Mueller told CNN in a phone interview.\n\nKayla Mueller was imprisoned by Isis before being killed in a 2015 airs trike at the age of 26.\n\nShe had travelled to the Turkey/Syria border to work with the Danish Refugee Council and the humanitarian organisation Support to Life in 2012. She was then taken hostage by Isis in Aleppo in 2013, after visiting a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital.\n\nThe family was told four months after Kayla\u2019s death that she was raped repeatedly by Baghdadi. Her body has yet to be found.\n\nCarl Mueller, the father, told KPHO-TV that the news of the Isis leader's death left him in shock.\n\n\u201cIt was a shock of course,\u201d he said. \u201cOne minute you\u2019re sitting here watching a movie, and the next minute you get the news the man that raped and possibly murdered your daughter has been killed.\u201d\n\nMs Mueller told CNN that the news gives them hope that they will be able to finally get some answers about her daughter\u2019s death, and to bring her home.\n\n\u201cBecause of that one per cent possibility, how do you completely give up until you have her home?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe want Kayla home, and I know that sounds like an impossible task, but after what we\u2019ve been through, the things that pop up and happen I believe we might just find her.\u201d\n\nMr Mueller added: \u201cWe feel this is the moment. He\u2019s been killed, some of his lieutenants have been captured, and who else would know what happened to Kayla but these people close to him? Somebody, and it may be one of these people who were captured yesterday, knows what happened and know who killed her.\u201d\n\nThey said they were willing to travel to Iraq to get answers.", "description": "The family of murdered Isis hostage Kayla Mueller say they are \u201cgrateful\u201d for the raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic caliphate who repeatedly raped the Arizona native after her kidnapping in 2013.The operation, which was named after Mueller, took place over the weekend,", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ntVPq0teYRe7DYglS6m6Rw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/2cc89822a8e5fbc73beeb85dead32d36", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
