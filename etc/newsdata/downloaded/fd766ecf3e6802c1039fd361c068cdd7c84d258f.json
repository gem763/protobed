She moved to London full-time in late 2017, when her engagement to Harry was announced.\n\nMeghan has made several trips back to the U.S. since her engagement to Harry -- including most recently flying to New York to cheer on Serena Williams at the U.S. Open -- but this will mark Archie's first trip to America and the first trip there as a family of three.\n\nArchie traveled with his parents to Southern Africa earlier this month for the family's 10-day tour. He made one official appearance on the tour, when he joined his parents to meet human rights activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\n\"It\u2019s not lost on us what a huge and significant moment that is and I think Archie will look back at that in so many years and understand that right at the beginning of his life he was fortunate enough to have this moment with one of the best and most impactful leaders of our time,\" Meghan told ITV News at Ten anchor Tom Bradby about the meeting. \"It\u2019s really special.\"\n\nThe new details about Harry and Meghan's expected trip to the U.S. come as the royal couple is speaking out about their behind-the-scenes struggle of living their lives in the spotlight.\n\n\"It\u2019s hard,\" Duchess Meghan told Bradby for the documentary, \"Harry & Meghan: An African Journey.\" \"I don\u2019t think anybody could understand that.\"\n\n\"Harry & Meghan: An African Journey\" -- which airs in the U.S. on Wednesday, Oct. 23, at 10 p.m. ET, on ABC -- follows the couple during their Southern Africa tour.\n\nPrince Harry spoke to Bradby about the pressure he feels to protect Meghan and Archie decades after the 1997 death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a car crash that involved paparazzi.\n\n\"I will always protect my family and now I have a family to protect,\" Harry said. \"So everything that she went through and what happened to her is incredibly raw every single day and that\u2019s not me being paranoid that\u2019s just me not wanting a repeat of the past.\"\n\n\"And if anybody else knew what I knew, be it a father, be it a husband, be it anyone, you\u2019d probably be doing exactly what I\u2019m doing as well,\" he said.\n\nTune into \u201cHarry & Meghan: An African Journey,\" hosted by \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor Robin Roberts, on Wednesday, Oct. 23, at 10 p.m. ET, on ABC.", "description": "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, was born and raised in California.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/markle-harry1-rt-ml-191018_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
