By then they were in British territorial waters so had to be picked up by the British,\u201d said a source.\n\nKent police chiefs have described similar cases where migrants have managed to reach halfway and made 999 calls to emergency services to be picked up by the British once they are in UK territorial waters.\n\nThe group were taken to land by the UK Border Force cutter, Vigilant, while another boat carrying eight migrants made it to Shakespeare Beach near Dover where it is understood they were arrested.\n\nThe incident, at 6.45am yesterday morning, was seen by passengers on a Channel ferry including British trucker Martin Cassidy who said: \u201cThe dinghy was very low in the water and the migrants were firing flares asking to be rescued.\n\n\"I looked out of the window and saw this tiny orange boat. You could tell it was a migrant dinghy. They were about two miles from the coast of Britain. It was a very cold night, the water was quite choppy, so they must have been getting very wet.\n\n\"The ferry kept a safe distance from the dingy but kept circling until a coastguard helicopter came over and then we saw two coastguard boats coming out of the port of Dover.\u201d\n\nSome 1,500 migrants have arrived in the UK this year, compared with 297 people caught attempting to enter the UK across the Channel in 2018. About 100 have been returned to Europe.\n\nThe Home Office confirmed the incident, saying: \u201cThe people who facilitate this are ruthless and do not care about the risk to life.\u201d\n\nA spokesman added: \u201cWe work with partners across Europe and beyond to tackle illegal migration and recently agreed a plan with France which has seen patrols on French beaches doubled and action to disrupt criminal gangs intensified as part of our work to prevent migrants crossing the Channel in small boats.\u201d", "description": "Migrants illegally crossing the Channel in a dinghy refused to be rescued by the French coastguard in order to be brought to England, it was claimed yesterday.", "authors": ["Dominic Nicholls", "Charles Hymas", "Defence", "Security Correspondent", "Home Affairs Editor", "Telegraph View", "William Hague", "Michael Deacon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000214402204-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqy0yIiMrEKADIhRQkbj697JiT7C5J4rbVcSjgFVMoaxE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
