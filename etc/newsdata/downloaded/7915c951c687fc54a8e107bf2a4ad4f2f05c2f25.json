And for a measly $7,100! Who wouldn\u2019t want that?\n\nWell, a number of people on Twitter, at least, who spent a good portion of their day Thursday mocking a hot dog sofa offered online by Neiman Marcus and its subsidiary, Bergdorf Goodman.\n\nThe Seletti couch is made in Italy and can be yours for $7,100 from the luxury retailer, plus tax, plus a $295 shipping fee, and is expected to ship no later than Dec. 5 \u2014 just in time for Christmas!\n\nThe sofa comes with sliced cucumber and tomato pillows, though it is unclear why anyone would put a tomato on a hot dog. Or a cucumber, for that matter. Perhaps it\u2019s an Italian thing.\n\nYou also apparently need to take off the hot dog cushion in order to comfortably sit on the sofa, making YOU the hot dog, which may or may not be your thing, we\u2019re not here to judge.\n\nSeletti No mustard or ketchup?\n\nTo fill out your street-meat-themed living room \u2014 or if the $7,100 price tag is too much for you \u2014 Seletti also makes a hamburger chair, for a mere $4,950 at Neiman Marcus, plus tax and a $250 shipping fee. It also comes with pickle and tomato pillows, but oddly, no cheese blanket. It also appears to have a layer of fabric the color of mayonnaise, which may repulse you. (Again, no judgment.)\n\nYou can also add condiments \u2014 $1,500 for a sliced tomato pillow, $930 for a sliced cucumber pillow, and $1,170 for a full pickle pillow.\n\nFolks on Twitter . . . had thoughts. Here are a few:\n\nI\u2019m suggesting the hot dog couch is a guerilla effort from a designer to turn folks vegetarian or vegan en masse. \ud83e\udd2e \u2014 \u26ab\ufe0f Julie Roberts (@julies_cr8tve) September 12, 2019\n\nIf you are stupid enough to put cucumber and tomato on a hot dog, 7k for a couch is a no brainer. \u2014 Greg\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 (@GregMoriarty) September 12, 2019\n\nWhere do you sit? If you want to relax on your hot dog couch, do you throw the wiener and all the toppings on the floor? \u2014 Robin Marwick (@electricland) September 12, 2019\n\nif you buy a hot dog couch from Neiman Marcus you only eat food presented by tuxedo'd waiters on silver trays who take the lid off with a theatrical flourish \u2014 Lord of Overstock (@lordofoverstock) September 12, 2019\n\nthis couch, much like a real hot dog, is also Not A Sandwich https://t.co/aK8SUHGbBq \u2014 Kristen Bolden (@kboldens) September 12, 2019\n\nImagine going on a date with someone. It goes well. A few drinks. Dinner. Maybe a movie. You go home with them. They open the front door and you see Hot Dog Couch.\n\n\n\nIt's not until they've closed & locked the door that you turn and see it's friend Burger Chair.\n\n\n\nYou're trapped. \u2014 30-50 feral hogs in a trench coat (@seagun) September 12, 2019\n\nBeing consumer-focused, we at MarketWatch would like to point out that the hot dog couch can also be yours for the discount price of $6,035 at 2modern.\n\nAlternatively, if you had put that $7,100 into buying stock of Neiman Marcus co-owner Ares Management Corp. ARES, +1.91% at the beginning of the year, you could have made a profit just about big enough to treat yourself to a hot dog sofa. Shares are up 71% year to date.", "description": "Who doesn\u2019t love a good hot dog?", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR223_hotdog_MG_20190912201431.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
