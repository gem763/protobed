A spokeswoman for SmileDirect didn\u2019t have any additional comment on the lawsuit.\n\nShares of Nashville, Tennessee-based SmileDirect were down 4.6% to $9.54 at 3:01 p.m. in New York, after earlier falling as much as 13%, after a short-seller on Twitter cited the lawsuit and the disclosure about the raids.\n\nSmileDirect offers an alternative to traditional braces, which are installed in an orthodontist office and have to be regularly adjusted. The company instead offers a set of clear plastic aligners that are swapped out gradually to move the teeth into the desired position. The treatment costs $1,895, which the company promotes as far less expensive than traditional braces.\n\n\u201cThe direct-to-consumer model supported by SmileDirect represents a serious competitive threat to their ability to continue to generate such fees through their traditional delivery model in the future,\u201d SmileDirect said in the lawsuit.\n\nThe technique also requires far fewer in-person visits by patients. The product has turned SmileDirect into a $3.7 billion market-valuation company. Analysts have projected it will bring in more than $1 billion in sales next year, though the company\u2019s shares have struggled since their Sept. 12 initial public offering at $23.\n\nIn the lawsuit, SmileDirect claims that California\u2019s dental board, which is made up largely of dentists, doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction over its shops.\n\nRepresentatives of the board raided SmileDirect\u2019s locations in Oakland, San Francisco and Hollywood in May 2018, according to the lawsuit, which claims the raids disrupted the company\u2019s business.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: John Tozzi in New York at jtozzi2@bloomberg.net;Janet Freund in New York at jfreund11@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net;Drew Armstrong at darmstrong17@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- SmileDirectClub Inc., which sells clear orthodontic aligners, alleges dentists who serve on a regulatory board in California conspired to hurt the company\u2019s business to protect their own practices.In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court, SmileDirect alleges the Dental Board of California", "authors": ["John Tozzi", "Janet Freund"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_ULLlA9iOuJuvEU6xTLXsA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/b3c4a1e9642105d6c164299bf5bf5642", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
