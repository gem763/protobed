The New York Times now reports that Kavanaugh faced a separate allegation from his time at Yale University and that the FBI did not investigate the claim. The latest claim mirrors one offered during his confirmation process by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate who claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party.\n\nWhen he testified before the Senate last year, Kavanaugh denied all allegations of impropriety.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said after the new report that \u201cBrett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people.\u201d She tweeted, \u201cHe must be impeached.\u201d\n\nHer comments followed similar ones from Julian Castro, a former U.S. housing secretary, on Saturday night. \u201cIt\u2019s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHe should be impeached and Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh to the court and fiercely defended him during his contentious confirmation process, dismissed the latest allegation as \u201clies.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet Sunday, Trump said Kavanaugh \u201cshould start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue.\u201d It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the Justice Department could come to the justice\u2019s defense.\n\nTrump added that they were \u201cFalse Accusations without recrimination,\u201d and claimed his accusers were seeking to influence Kavanaugh\u2019s opinions on the bench.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At least two Democratic presidential candidates are calling for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the face of a new, uninvestigated, allegation of sexual impropriety when he was in college.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/12/11/quotes_of_the_year_46671_c0-142-4864-2977_s1770x1032.jpg?c99db209de31f937cb402e6da3613b3ebe285e57", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
