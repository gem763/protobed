And in Q2, the TLRY suffered an EBITDA loss of $17.9 million on net revenues of only $42.0 million. Nonetheless, the company\u2019s market cap is still around $2.6 billion\n\nWith that being said, Azer still perceives TLRY\u2019s recent weakness as a buying opportunity, and believes that Tilray stock will outperform the market.\n\nShe noted that the Canadian market \u201chas been challenging over the last few months, as too few stores, supply shortages and a lack of novel products have hampered category development. We would argue that TLRY has been the most impacted by weak industry supply as its asset-light model was initially overly reliant on third-party supply.\n\nAzer maintained her outperform rating, pointing out the company\u2019s strategic position to enter the U.S. CBD market and its proactive moves to address capacity constraints.\n\nShe also cited its expanding international opportunities, noting that Tilray\u2019s Portuguese license awaits final GMP certifications. She anticipates that the Canadian industry will work out its supply problems, becoming a C$12 billion market by 2025.\n\n\u201cWe would argue that TLRY has been the most impacted by weak industry supply as its asset light model was initially overly reliant on third-party supply,\u201d Azer said.\n\n\u201cWhile the company has indicated that it is seeing pockets of improvement, and recently moved up its supply/demand balancing timeline, it has also proactively addressed its capacity by expanding its current facilities as well as through the Natura Naturals acquisition.\u201d\n\nWith Cowen\u2019s lower price target, Michael Hickey at Benchmark Co. is currently Tilray\u2019s biggest bull with an $80 target.\n\nTilray\u2019s partners and acquisitions\n\nJust last week Tilray announced the purchase of Canadian cannabis retail operator 420 Investments Ltd. The retailer operates six locations and has 16 additional licenses across Alberta.\n\nThis comes on the heels of another recent announcement about Tilray\u2019s acquisition of Manitoba Harvest Hemp. However, contrary to the Manitoba Harvest Hemp deal, which was done as a 50/50 blend of cash and stocks, the 420 deal was done in all Tilray shares.\n\nBut utilizing shares to acquire companies can send mixed signals to investors. It\u2019s important to note that Privateer is a private-equity firm that was an early investor in Tilray stock. Privateer owns 75 million shares of Tilray stock, which is approximately 77% of the publicly available shares of TLRY stock.\n\nPrivateer and Tilray just announced that they signed a letter of intent to extend the restrictions on the sale of Tilray stock. The deal also stipulates an eventual release of 75 million shares of Tilray stock.\n\nThis means that if 75 million shares of Tilray stock are going to hit the market, it could pose potential challenges for Tilray.\n\nTilray Inc. Cl 2 (TLRY) was trading at $29.04 per share on Wednesday afternoon, down $1.06 (-3.52%). Year-to-date, TLRY has declined N/A%, versus a 10.35% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by ETF Daily News covering: Tilray Inc.
