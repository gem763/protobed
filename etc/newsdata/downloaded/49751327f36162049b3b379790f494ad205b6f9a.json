Pat Nixon was an activist for more women to run for elective office, encouraged her husband to appoint more women to federal positions as well as nominate a woman to the Supreme Court, opened up White House tours for the blind, established traditions such as garden tours, and as former White House Curator Betty Monkman told us at the panel discussion, Pat Nixon added more than 600 artifacts to the White House collection, more than any first lady before or since her.\n\nShe also \u201cchampioned the lives of the underprivileged, the sick and the forgotten,\u201d as stated in a letter from first lady Melania Trump Melania TrumpThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Dems, former Bolton aide clash over testimony The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - ISIS leader dead; Congresswoman resigns Secret Service interviewed Eminem about Trump-threatening lyrics MORE for an event two years ago, when Pat Nixon was honored at the University of Southern California marking 80 years since she graduated cum laude from the college. The relatively new first lady Melania Trump sent that letter to be read at the celebration, also stating that Pat Nixon is a \u201ctrue role model\u201d as first lady who is \u201cworthy of our admiration and remembrance.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYet the image of Pat Nixon remains mired in passivity and stereotype. She never sought the limelight, but the problems of her husband and her willingness to stand by him during a difficult period overshadowed her accomplishments and overwhelmed her story as an activist for women, children and families, and for civic participation across our nation.\n\nSome aspects of the role are too difficult to control, especially the \u201cmedia crucible\u201d as Betty Ford called it, that each first lady has faced since the founding of our nation. It can be challenging for first ladies to break through and be evaluated for their unique experiences. While it is too early to measure the full impact of the work of Melania Trump, it seems that in the political environment today, history is repeating itself with the coverage and understanding of her interests and initiatives.\n\nIn my work at American University, I examine the position of first ladies throughout our history and promote the influence these women have had on our politics, policy, and global diplomacy. First ladies are a fascinating topic in American history and culture. Thankfully through more scholarly research and events, with participation from journalists such as Ann Compton and the late Cokie Roberts, first ladies are receiving more attention for their accomplishments and their impact on key issues.\n\nEqual attention is paid to their influence on preserving the White House as museum of history and decorative arts as well as a family residence of elegance and charm. This was a priority of first lady Jackie Kennedy, who founded the White House Historical Association in 1961 as the vehicle to preserve the building and enhance public understanding of its history and its occupants. As with other first ladies who embraced this responsibility, Melania Trump, in remarks at a White House dinner earlier this year, stated her gratitude \u201cto live in this true symbol\u201d of American history and \u201cto play a part in restoring and enhancing\u201d the White House for the public.\n\nFree from specific statutory responsibilities, each first lady can choose how to use her powerful platform and put her unique stamp on the office. Melania Trump did not follow the past tradition of immediately moving to the White House after the inauguration and of hiring staff prior to the inauguration. Many were curious how she would approach her new role. \u201cI will stay true to myself,\u201d she said, thus not defined by the expectations others have of her, the position of first lady, or the staffing of her office.\n\nAs the historian William Seale said, \u201cThey may be criticized at first for not appearing to be like the women in the past who have held the job, yet they prevail for being themselves, which is what Americans want all along.\u201d\n\nAnita McBride is executive in residence at American University School of Public Affairs.
