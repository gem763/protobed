He'll still blast them if they've done something he doesn't like.\n\nTrump has disparaged generals and decorated soldiers, including the late Sen. John McCain, his former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and the former special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nOne of his favorite terms for someone he dislikes is a \"Never Trumper,\" which he has said are \"human scum.\"\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nServing in the military provides no protection from President Donald Trump's ire.\n\nTrump has never served in any capacity. He received five military deferments \u2014 one for bone spurs, and four for education \u2014 during the Vietnam War.\n\nBut he's repeatedly disparaged the late Sen. John McCain, dragged his former officials, and told four-star generals they're overrated.\n\nIn the last few years, he's also started calling veterans who have been critical of him \"Never Trumpers,\" which he has said are \"human scum.\"\n\nHere are 16 veterans or military families that Trump has disparaged.\n\nIn July 2015, at a forum in Iowa, then-presidential candidate Trump said Sen. John McCain, who retired from the Navy as a captain, awarded a Silver Star and a Distinguished Flying Cross, was only a war hero because he had been taken hostage. \"He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured,\" Trump said.\n\nAP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin\n\nHe said he didn't like McCain after he lost to Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, because he didn't like \"losers\".\n\nWhen McCain died in 2018, Trump refused to lower the White House flag back to half-staff, even though it's become customary for presidents to sign a proclamation calling for the flag to remain at half-staff for members of congress until the day of interment, Business Insider's John Haltiwanger reported.\n\nMonths later, Trump still wasn't over it in March 2019, and during a speech in Ohio, he said he'd \"had to give\" McCain a funeral he wanted. \"I don't care about this, I didn't get 'thank you.' That's OK,\" he said. \"We sent him on the way, but I wasn't a fan of John McCain.\"\n\nTrump continued his attacks criticizing him again in March 2019, for the role he played in the investigations into whether Russia influenced the 2016 election. \"Spreading the fake and totally discredited Dossier 'is unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain,'\" he tweeted, referring to McCain's decision in December 2016 to turn the dossier containing salacious (and largely uncorroborated) intel about Trump over to the FBI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2016, Trump turned his ire onto Sen. Lindsay Graham, who served in the US Air Force and rose to the rank of Colonel, calling him a disgrace. He also said Graham was one of the \"dumbest human beings\" he'd ever seen, and that he was a \"nut job.\"", "description": "Here are all of the former US veterans or their families that President Donald Trump has disparaged over the years.", "authors": ["James Pasley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9EOUY_U1nXwkw73QbnTQJA--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/2d080e5a3e188d87759ad1fbee6b84fd", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
