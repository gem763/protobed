What\u2019s more, there actually is a scandal surrounding Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter landing a $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 gig with a Ukrainian energy company, when Hunter knows nothing about energy or Ukraine. Zelensky is worried about this and Trump asked him to look into it, which is not \u201cdigging up dirt,\u201d as Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) phony \u201cwhistleblower\u201d pal claimed.\n\nThe Nation understands this. Mat\u00e9 wrote:\n\nDemocratic leaders and media pundits are convinced that Trump extorted Ukraine by delaying military aid to compel an investigation into Biden. Their theory may prove correct, but the available evidence does not, as of now, make for a strong case. Trump had held up military aid to Ukraine by the time of his call with Zelensky, but if the public transcript is accurate, it did not come up during their conversation. According to The New York Times, Zelensky\u2019s government did not learn that the military aid was frozen until more than one month later.\n\nMat\u00e9 is also not buying the current media/Democrat fake news about the overall allegation surrounding the word \u201cfavor.\u201d Mat\u00e9 wrote:\n\nIt is also unclear from the transcript what exactly Trump wants Zelensky to do. The president\u2019s rambling leaves room for ambiguity. On the Biden front, Trump tells Zelensky that \u201cwhatever you can do with the Attorney General [William Barr] would be great\u201d and also asks him to \u201clook into it.\u201d But Barr says that he and Trump never spoke about investigating Biden or contacting Ukraine; Zelensky says that he did not feel any pressure to investigate Biden; and \u201clook into it\u201d can be interpreted in ways ranging from damning to benign. Moreover, Trump\u2019s foremost concern\u2014and the object of the \u201cfavor\u201d he asks Zelensky\u2014is not Biden, but securing the Ukrainian president\u2019s assistance with Barr\u2019s review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Although he may be incoherent, Trump is within his rights to ask for Ukraine\u2019s cooperation.\n\nAnd then there is this key point, about how Democrats cocked the gun of impeachment before seeing the nothingburger transcript, saying:\n\n[P]erhaps there is still a smoking gun to be found. But if not, then as it stands, Democrats would be pushing for the most serious verdict possible, removal of the president from office, on a shaky case. Democrats also opted to do so before both the transcript and complaint were released. It is worth asking why Trump\u2019s behavior was already deemed impeachment-worthy before such critical pieces of evidence were available.\n\nMat\u00e9 despises Trump and accuses him of all kinds of terrible things, things that are not \u2014 much to Mat\u00e9\u2019s frustration \u2014 impeachable, but he is at least looking at this particular issue with clear eyes.\n\nHe also sees the Biden scandal with clear eyes, writing:\n\nRepublicans will also get ample opportunities to highlight Democratic double standards. Even if Trump and Giuliani\u2019s worst suspicions about Biden are incorrect, what is already established is damning enough. Hunter Biden obtained his lucrative board seat on a Ukrainian gas company despite having no experience in the country, and just months after his father\u2019s administration backed a coup that overthrew its government. That very fact will weaken any Democratic effort to highlight Trump\u2019s efforts to enrich himself and his family through the Oval Office.\n\nNot forgotten is the Democrat\u2019s breathtaking double standard as it pertains to seeking \u201celection help\u201d from Ukraine. Mat\u00e9 wrote:\n\nRepublicans will also point to the irony of Trump\u2019s being accused of seeking 2020 election help from Ukraine after Democratic Party officials already received such help in 2016. And after they take their turns hammering Biden\u2019s dealings and Democrats\u2019 hypocrisy, Senate Republicans will inevitably vote for Trump\u2019s acquittal.\n\nAs the polls already show, if this is all the Democrats got, they have gone all-in on a losing hand that can only end in one of two ways: 1) Trump emerges victorious after Democrats back away from impeachment, or 2) Democrats blow themselves up wasting valuable legislative time on yet another hoax driven only by their childish inability to accept the results of the 2016 election.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
