On Saturday, Rooney announced his retirement.\n\nDuring an interview on Friday, Rooney was pressed by CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow while discussing acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s Thursday admission that Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine. Rooney said he hadn\u2019t come to any conclusions but added, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can rule anything out unless you know all the facts.\u201d\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nRooney continued, \u201cWhatever might have been gray and unclear before, is certainly quite clear right now. The actions [by Trump] were related to getting Ukraine to do some things\u2026 We\u2019re not supposed to use government power or prestige for political gain.\u201d\n\nAlso on Friday, according to the Washington Post, Rooney spoke with reporters about impeachment and said he wanted \u201cto get the facts and do the right thing because I\u2019ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I\u2019m looking to anybody in this building.\u201d Rooney added, \u201cI didn\u2019t take this job to keep it\u2026 I took this job to do the right thing at all times.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about possible backlash from the president, Rooney said, \u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do to me? I mean, he can say bad things, but it\u2019s just what it is.\u201d Rooney continued, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people around who are seriously concerned about being criticized by the president. Seriously. I just want to call them as I see it.\u201d\n\nThen, on Saturday, Rooney went on Fox News and announced his retirement. Rooney said his job as a congressman was fulfilled, saying, \u201cI thought the idea was you came and did your public service and left, you accomplish what you want to accomplish and you left.\u201d Rooney also said he\u2019s grown tired of Washington gridlock: \u201cI\u2019m also tired of the intense partisanship that stops us from solving the big questions that America needs solved.\u201d\n\nRooney signaled a lack of fear of Trump when speaking out on Friday. However, his quick announcement to not run again seems to tell a different story. After betraying the Kurds in favor of Turkey, Trump has received more than the usual amount of pushback from Republicans this week, but they are well aware that if they come close to forcefully speaking out against this president they will get the Mitt Romney treatment. And most want no part of that.\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
