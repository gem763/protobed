There was no \"2am date with Tyga\". You see me drop two of my friends off at a studio that he happened to be at.'\n\nThe seeming connection between the two raised eyebrows, coming just the day news broke that Kylie and her baby daddy Travis Scott had secretly broken up weeks ago.\n\nBut Kylie wrote on Thursday: 'Travis and I are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi\u203c\ufe0f our friendship and our daughter is priority.'\n\nTyga has not commented on his links with Kylie.

(Stassi and Kelsey headed home in a black SUV.)\n\nKylie managed to stay out of sight during the stop at Sunset Marque, with one onlooker claiming she left via a different exit. However she insists she was simply giving her pals a ride, and did not visit Tyga.\n\nHaving fun: Despite arriving separately, Khloe gave her 98.7million Instagram followers a glimpse of their raucous night out as she took to the platform's story and shared a clip of them inside the club\n\nKylie is said to be on friendly terms with her ex and they do occasionally run in the same circles.
