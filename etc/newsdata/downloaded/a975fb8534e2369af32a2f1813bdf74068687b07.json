The couple were partners for 23 years and had two children together, Noah and Agnes, before separating in 2015.\n\nOwen died aged 48, in 2016, after suffering from cancer. She had been in poor health that year but continued to teach Italian into her final months.\n\nAsked about being a father to the two teenagers, Yorke told Lauren Laverne, presenter of the BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs: \u201cI can\u2019t hope to be their mum but we\u2019re all right. I\u2019m just really proud of them both. It stuns me most days. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re anything to do with me. They\u2019re just such great people.\u201d\n\nOwen was an internationally renowned artist, mixing photography and printmaking. Her academic work focused on Italian medieval literature.\n\nYorke said: \u201cWhen the kids\u2019 mum died, it was a very difficult period and we went through a lot. It was very hard. She suffered a great deal and my ambition is to make sure that we have come out of it all right, and I hope that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky now because I have a new partner who has come and brought a light into all of it, which has taken a great deal of strength. And really if all that\u2019s OK \u2026 If I\u2019m able to make some music that expresses all that and is still important to people, that\u2019s more than I can ask for.\u201d\n\nThe musician has spent much of his career criticising politicians for not doing enough about the climate emergency. But he admitted to Laverne that he was a hypocrite for flying around the world on tour while campaigning for change.\n\n\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve always struggled somewhat with, is if I\u2019m campaigning on climate change, I\u2019m someone who has to fly for my work so ... I\u2019m a hypocrite. I totally agree I\u2019m a hypocrite but \u2026 what do you want to do about it?\u201d\n\nLast month, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex sparked a furore for reportedly taking four private jet journeys in 11 days, despite speaking out on environmental issues. Sir Elton John came to their defence, claiming he had made sure the flights were carbon neutral by contributing to a carbon footprint fund.\n\nWhen asked about the criticism, Yorke said: \u201cThe truth of the matter is we\u2019re all part of a system. It\u2019s a systemic thing that has to change. You can do stuff but the real stuff has to happen in parliament and the UN, and has to happen now, we\u2019re out of time.\u201d\n\nYorke also spoke of how he found it difficult to cope with Radiohead\u2019s success initially. \u201cI got angry. I\u2019m an extremely angry person. I got more control-freakery. I put my hands on the steering wheel and I was white-knuckled, and I didn\u2019t care who I hurt or what I said,\u201d he said. \u201cYears later I sat down with the guys and apologised. By the time we got to recording OK Computer the doors had opened up and we had the best time doing that record.\u201d\n\nHe said REM frontman Michael Stipe \u201chelped me when things went crazy, when people started to talk to me like I was Jesus \u2026 on the street\u201d.\n\nDesert Island Discs is on Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15am and will then be available on the BBC Sounds app.", "description": "Radiohead singer talks on Desert island Discs about the strain on his family after Rachel Owen died", "authors": ["Aamna Mohdin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0601e4f67d408f9a46eec64d3a0b1a332d3de5f/579_142_3365_2019/master/3365.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1cf2689982667a2d6e01afb09571d0f2", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
