(Charles Platiau/Reuters)\n\nTo the untrained eye, it was a nice enough painting. Small and wooden, old and religious; it would probably look good in the kitchen, maybe the hallway.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where it hung for years, in the home of a French woman in her 90s who reportedly assumed it was a relic, an icon of little importance and less value. She may have even considered tossing it as she prepared to move out of her house in Compiegne, a town north of Paris.\n\nHad she done that, the art world would have lost a masterpiece, and she would have lost millions.\n\nA dusty icon it was not.\n\nThe painting is titled \u201cChrist Mocked,\u201d and it has been attributed to the 13th-century Italian artist Cenni di Pepo, known as Cimabue, a legendary figure widely seen as a Renaissance forefather. Experts have identified only 10 or so other Cimabue paintings, and his work remains exceedingly rare \u2014 making this improbable rediscovery even more remarkable.\n\n\u201cThis is a hugely, hugely important discovery,\u201d said Xavier F. Salomon, the chief curator at the Frick Collection in Manhattan, home to the only Cimabue painting outside Europe. \u201cHe\u2019s seen as the grandfather of Western painting, and he\u2019s very, very rare. So the discovery of a new work by him is a really incredible thing.\u201d\n\nThe piece could fetch nearly $7 million when it\u2019s put up for sale Oct. 27.\n\nIts owner, the French woman who hasn\u2019t been publicly identified, asked an auctioneer to look through her house before she moved out this summer, the Associated Press reported. The auctioneer spotted it and suggested she take it to art experts at the Turquin gallery in Paris, who concluded with \u201ccertitude\u201d it was a Cimabue.\n\n\u201cYou rarely see something of such quality,\u201d Philom\u00e8ne Wolf, the auctioneer who discovered the painting, told Le Parisien. \u201cI immediately thought it was a work of Italian primitivism. But I didn\u2019t imagine it was a Cimabue.\u201d\n\nThe 8-by-10-inch painting is in very good condition, said Salomon, whose colleague at the Frick saw the work in person last week. That\u2019s a miracle given not only its age \u2014 nearly 800 years old \u2014 but also where it apparently hung in the Compiegne home: right above a hot plate, though it\u2019s unclear that\u2019s where the family did its cooking.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it, this thing has been around for several hundred years; it\u2019s probably been through a lot,\u201d Salomon said. \u201cIt\u2019s been through the French Revolution. It\u2019s been through several wars. Works of art are more resistant than people think.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill,\u201d he added, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone putting something that old over a hot plate.\u201d\n\nScholars think of Cimabue as the historical link between two periods of art, the Medieval and the Renaissance, Salomon said. He began adding character and dimension to Byzantine art, making it more human. He also taught Giotto, considered one of the greatest artists of the era.\n\n\u201cHe was very on the cusp of that,\u201d Salomon said of Cimabue. \u201cHe is the one where this shift really begins.\u201d\n\nThe painting is part of a larger work, a companion piece to one in the Frick Collection, known as \u201cThe Flagellation of Christ\u201d and acquired in 1950, and one in London\u2019s National Gallery, titled \u201cThe Virgin and Child With Two Angels\u201d and acquired in 2000. The series \u2014 which could number either four or eight, Salomon said \u2014 depicts Christ\u2019s passion and crucifixion.\n\n\n\nThe painting \u201cChrist Mocked,\u201d center, is displayed in Paris on Tuesday. At left and right, copies of two other Cimabue paintings thought to have been part of the same series. (Charles Platiau/Reuters)\n\nThe Paris specialists matched the wood of the newly found painting to the wood of its partners, CNN reported. Then they used an infrared light to match the brushstrokes.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, however, art critic Jonathan Jones urged the public to be skeptical of early, high-profile identifications of long-lost masterpieces.\n\n\u201cThis is the new norm at the profitable end of the Old Masters market,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cGreat stories about unlikely discoveries sweep all before them, but art experts have recently been fooled by proven fakes. \u2026 Not that I am saying this is a fake \u2014 just that the identification of old paintings is and always has been fraught with peril. It shouldn\u2019t be accepted solely on the seller\u2019s say-so, or because it makes a good story.\u201d\n\nFor Salomon and others in the art world, the assembly of Cimabue\u2019s series has been a thrilling piece-by-piece treasure hunt.\n\n\u201cWe were all hoping that more fragments would come up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt adds pieces to the puzzle. It allows us to understand the painter in a better way.\u201d\n\nAt this point, the Frick Collection isn\u2019t looking to buy the painting \u2014 \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be greedy,\u201d Salomon said \u2014 but the museum would be interested in reuniting the three in an exhibit some day.\n\nOr perhaps, in another few years, another long unrecognized Cimabue will resurface in an unlikely locale, and the picture will finally be complete.\n\n\u201cThat happens more often than people think,\u201d Salomon said. \u201cMany of the great discoveries made in the last 50 years were all made in places people didn\u2019t expect them to be.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA school bet its future on paintings worth $2.8 million \u2014 then learned their real value\n\nWhat a stolen Alexander Hamilton letter reveals about the sticky business of fine art\n\nA small-town couple left behind a stolen painting worth over $100 million \u2014 and a big mystery", "description": "The painting is said to be one of the few identified paintings by Cimabue, a 13th century Italian artist considered the grandfather of the Renaissance.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "September At Am", "Reis Thebault Is A Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News.
