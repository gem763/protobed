And yet every match against Asian opposition adds more to the Socceroos\u2019 collective knowledge of this vast and diverse continent.\n\nA first game on home soil of the 2022 campaign, Graham Arnold and his staff will be looking to impress home fans, whilst continuing to build in terms of playing style and processes and no doubt taking the opportunity to blood some new talent.\n\nOn paper Nepal lack the depth of talent to seriously challenge Australia, but boast some talented individuals - who knows, maybe prodigy Bimal Gharti Magar will add to his growing reputation, or skipper Kiran Chemjong might put on a virtuoso display between the sticks to frustrate his hosts.\n\nIt\u2019s still early days on the journey to Qatar. So sit back, Socceroos fans, and enjoy the game played in every corner of this remarkable planet.", "description": "Minute-by-minute: The Socceroos are expected to roll over Nepal in Canberra.
