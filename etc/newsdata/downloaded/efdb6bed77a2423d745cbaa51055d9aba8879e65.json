The musician (25) and model (22) were legally married in a secret Manhattan courthouse ceremony about a year ago, but in keeping with the celebrity two-wedding trend, celebrated\n\nthe full-scale event yesterday, a Monday. Bieber posted throwback pictures of him and \u201cthe wife\u201d leading up to the event, thanking her parents for allowing her to marriage a \u201csavage\u201d such as himself:\n\nPhotos from the very Christian nuptials are rolling in today. So far, we don\u2019t know much about what proceeded, except that it was likely to have involved both praying and partying, the couple\u2019s preferred pastimes.\n\nPhoto: Justin Bieber/Instagram\n\nThe event was reportedly star-studded, with Usher, Katy Perry, and Ed Sheeran in attendance. The Jenner sisters were also there, but it looks like the Hadids opted for Rihanna\u2019s Fenty party at Paris Fashion Week (can\u2019t really blame them). The wedding also included copious amounts of fresh juice, and seemed to be either carnival or The Notebook\u2013themed (in an interview with the Cut last year, Baldwin said she was initially drawn to a woodsy setting on the West Coast, but that was apparently scrapped in favor of the big Southern bash.) Bieber shared a few images of himself and Baldwin on Instagram early this morning:", "description": "Justin Bieber has married Hailey Baldwin in their second wedding, a star-studded South Carolina event.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/10/01/01-bieber-wedding-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
