They were released a week later.\n\nThey all denied attacking the young Briton, who was said to have met one of the group at a pool party and agreed to have sex with him.\n\nThe British teenager leaves the Famagusta District Court in Paralimni in eastern Cyprus in July\n\nIt comes after the woman's legal team claimed in August she had been a victim of 'revenge porn' after the youths sent friends a video of her having drunken sex - which has since gone viral.\n\nAccording to Israeli sources, the video has been shared widely via WhatsApp, social media and even on porn sites after one or more of the youths sent it to friends.\n\nThe footage is also believed to show the group making derogatory comments about the woman in Hebrew during the encounter.\n\nOne source said: 'The video is everywhere. In it you can hear one of the boys saying in Hebrew \"You're my whore - say you are my whore\".\n\nThe Israeli boys were criticised for their jubilant celebrations with friends and family when they arrived back in Israel (above)\n\n'She doesn't understand and asks what they are saying and one of them replies in English \"We are saying you're sexy\". It is not very nice. It's not how men should act. A lot of people in Israel are starting to question their behaviour.'\n\nHer family, who said the teenager has been diagnosed with PTSD, has set up a crowdfunding page asking for money for legal costs, which has raised more than \u00a336,000.\n\nIn an online post, the family said: 'We live in hope that it will be resolved in this time. Thanks to all of you for making this possible'.", "description": "The 19-year-old (pictured outside middle court today) claimed in July that a group of 12  Israelis had attacked and sexually assaulted her at Cypriot party resort Ayia Napa.", "authors": ["Nick Fagge In Cyprus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/10/19732260-0-image-a-19_1571130967586.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
