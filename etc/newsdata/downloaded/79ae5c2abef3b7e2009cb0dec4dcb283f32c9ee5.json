It was of course scheduled last week before Nancy Pelosi announced her support for impeachment, but after we knew about the whistleblower and the bombshell IG report.\n\nNo, Act One wasn\u2019t the release of this \u201ctranscript\u201d Wednesday morning. Yes, It\u2019s plenty damning\u2014it has Donald Trump mentioning Joe Biden, but I guess because it\u2019s just once and not eight times, and because there\u2019s no explicit quid pro quo, the Trumpists will try to spin it as exculpatory. Ethically and morally, this release smells like Bill Barr\u2019s pre-interpretation of the Mueller Report. Let\u2019s not fall for that a second time.\n\nBut Maguire\u2019s testimony\u2014that will be real. Or, it might be. Most people in Maguire\u2019s position here would be wanting to flee town. But in fact, he\u2019s in a position to do something extremely unusual for Washington. He\u2019s in a position to do the right thing. He\u2019s in a position to live up to the oaths he\u2019s sworn to the Constitution for 30-plus years as a Navy SEAL and a counter-terrorism expert and now the country\u2019s director of national intelligence and tell the truth. He\u2019s in a position to be a hero.", "description": "All he has to do is come to the hearing with the IG report and then testify fully and honestly as to its contents.
