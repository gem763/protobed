All three children died, while Maverik Lowe, 11, was injured in critical condition.\n\nSantiago Flores/South Bend Tribune via AP\n\nLowe, who entered the courtroom Wednesday using a walker, testified that he saw the headlights of an approaching vehicle as he crossed the road toward the bus. He recalled having only a couple of second to decide what to do.\n\n\"I decided to go forward,\" he said, at which point he was struck. He remembered struggling to breath as he lay in a ditch before rescuers had him airlifted him to a hospital, where he spend 30 days and ultimately underwent 21 surgeries.\n\nShepherd, in her testimony, said she dropped her husband at work and was on her way to drop her kids at school and welcome a new youth pastor to church when she came upon a large vehicle, according to South Bend, Indiana, ABC affiliate WBND.\n\n\"I saw a vehicle, it was a very large vehicle. I couldn't tell what it was,\" Shepherd told the court, saying that she assumed it was an oversized-load modular home.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw children I instantly knew it was a bus,\" Shepherd said. She testified that doesn't remember how she moved the steering wheel but said she did brake.\n\nIndiana State Police\n\nHer husband testified that Shepherd called him shortly after the accident.\n\n\"She was very hysterical. I couldn\u2019t quite make out what was going on. I assumed she was in an accident,\" he said.\n\nThe parents of the three children who were killed, Shane Ingle and Brittany Stahl, told ABC News following the accident that their loss was \"more than what we can even express in words.\"\n\n\"A parent never expects to bury their child,\" the couple said in a statement. \"Every night we go to sleep without their hugs and kisses. And every morning we wake up to reality and wishing it was just a dream. We miss them so much. Our lives are forever changed.\"\n\nShepherd, who will be sentenced on Dec. 18, now faces up to 21 1/2 years in prison.\n\nCourtesy Elgin Ingle\n\nThe crash led the Indiana legislature to increase statewide penalties for drivers who pass stopped school buses illegally.\n\nShortly after the accident, the supervisor of the local school district announced that the bus stop where the crash occurred would be relocated into the mobile home park where the victims lived.", "description": "An Indiana woman who failed to stop for a school bus and struck four children with her pickup truck, killing three of them, has been found guilty of reckless homicide.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/children-bus-1-ap-er-181030_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
