But as we drove down the road, the scream wasn\u2019t fading.\n\n\u2018One of the fans had jumped on to the spare wheel on the back of the van and the scream kept on going and going and going.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the band realised the fan was clinging on the back of their moving car \u2013 but their driver soon put a stop to that\u2026\n\nHe added: \u2018It was only after a while we realised, \u201cHang on, that scream\u2019s not going anywhere\u201d . . . until the van driver took a sharp right turn and the scream disappeared.\n\nThe band are currently finishing their final ever tour (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018We never found out what happened to her. That was pretty f**king crazy.\u2019\n\nErm, someone should probably have checked whether the fan was ok\u2026 here\u2019s hoping she lived to tell the tale after being flung off the back of a speeding vehicle.\n\nThe band added that despite their clean-cut image, they think they were more rock and roll than most rock stars.\n\nKeith explained: \u2018The perception of rock stars is that they\u2019re all about sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, and a boyband is all pretty boys, who are squeaky clean.\n\nThe band insist they weren\u2019t as squeaky clean as people think (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018That was completely f**king wrong. We were more honest. If you look at a rock band, they\u2019ve got long hair that\u2019s permed \u2014 how are they cooler than us?\n\n\u2018We had shaved heads and were in the bar until six o\u2019clock in the morning.\u2019\n\nBoyzone are currently performing five shows at the London Palladium this week as an end to their 26-year career as a band, which will come to a close on Friday, 25 October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs well as the tour to celebrate their 25th anniversary, the band also released their final record Thank You & Goodnight last year.\n\nWhile fans are no doubt going to miss them, at least it will mean no more of their followers will risk life and limb by flying off the back of cars while trying to get close to them.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
