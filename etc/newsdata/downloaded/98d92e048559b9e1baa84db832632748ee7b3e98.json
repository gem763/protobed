We love you so much #familyiseverything.\u2019\n\nJamie was among the first to comment, posting: [Love] her so much x.\u2019\n\n\u2018Such a beautiful little girl! Happy birthday,\u2019 another replied.\n\nAn Instagram user said: \u2018She\u2019s so cute have a lovely birthday.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile one fan couldn\u2019t resist making a little dig about her row with Coleen, adding: \u2018It\u2019s \u2026\u2026\u2026.. Rebekah Vardy.\u2019\n\nThat meme isn\u2019t going anywhere soon\u2026\n\nTheir comment comes after Rebekah and Coleen found themselves in the mother of all feuds, earlier this month.\n\nRebekah and Jamie Vardy are expecting their fourth child together (Picture: Getty)\n\nIt all kicked off when Wayne Rooney\u2019s wife accused the I\u2019m A Celebrity star of selling stories about her to the press in a lengthy Instagram statement \u2013 something she has furiously denied.\n\n\u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories,\u2019 the 33-year-old began.\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\n\u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\nColeen Rooney claimed Rebekah had been leaking stories about her (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nFans couldn\u2019t cope with the drama, with memes taking over social media and #WAGathaChristie trending on Twitter.\n\nJamie was also mocked on his return to the football pitch over the weekend, in Leicester\u2019s game against Burnley.\n\nRebekah, who is pregnant with her fifth child, swiftly denied all claims, sharing her own statement on Instagram.\n\n\u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nSo. Much. Drama.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
