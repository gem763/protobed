It\u2019s not going to happen tomorrow,\n\n\"I\u2019m not actively looking for anything like that but, yeah, if it happens! I think I\u2019m always going to be a lover of love and a believer of love.\n\n\"I\u2019ve always been positive. Everyone goes through ups and downs in relationships. I\u2019ve been married twice, engaged a few times, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever give up on love \u2013 it\u2019s a beautiful thing.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been in love many times, I\u2019ve been lucky enough to experience what a kind, loving relationship feels like.\n\n\"Love can be heartbreaking and at the same time, it can be full of joy and passion and beauty.\u201d\n\nMel was married to Gulzar, 44, from 1998 to 2000 and they have daughter Phoenix, 20.\n\nShe dated Murphy, 58, in 2006 and he is the father of daughter Angel, 12.\n\nBut her romantic life really hit the headlines when her explosive relationship with TV producer Belafonte, 44, came to an end.\n\nThey had been married for 10 years and cited \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d, requesting joint custody of daughter Madison, eight.\n\nBut things took a dramatic turn when Mel got a restraining order, claiming she suffered physical and verbal abusive throughout their marriage.\n\nClaiming she tried to leave him several times, she added: \u201cHe threatened me with violence and threatened to destroy my life.\u201d\n\nMel also claimed he forced her into threesomes and got their nanny pregnant \u2013 then used her cash for an abortion. Belafonte has strenuously denied all of Mel\u2019s claims.\n\nThe singer says her relationship woes mean that she has effectively brought up her children alone.\n\nShe says: \u201cI was a single parent for eight years with Phoenix when she was first born and being a single parent is really challenging because you do feel by yourself in a world where you\u2019re doing it for the first time.\n\n\"Even throughout my marriage, I\u2019d say I was kind of a single parent because I was doing everything for my kids, plus working.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been the provider and supporter for my kids. This time around, I have a little more support because Phoenix is 20. So, yeah, it feels very safe and lovely.\u201d\n\nThe star\u2019s marriage problems caused a family rift with mum Andrea and her former Emmerdale actress sister, Danielle.\n\nBut they are now reconciled and she found being part of a large family crucial in getting through such a tough time.\n\nShe is now even hosting her own podcast, The Truth Flirts, for dating app Badoo to discuss the highs and lows of romance.\n\nMel says: \u201cEverybody needs time to heal, to build your inner strength back up, to start your healing process \u2013 that\u2019s what I did, and that\u2019s going to be an ongoing thing for me.\n\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s been in that kind of intense relationship should find time to do that. Being around my mum, my sister \u2013 my mum\u2019s one of seven, so I\u2019ve got lots of nephews and nieces \u2013 being around family has been amazing for me.\u201d\n\nMel has now moved from her Los Angeles home back to her native Leeds, West Yorkshire, where she is focusing on raising her daughters.\n\nAnd, just as she told us when the Spice Girl first exploded into the charts, she believes girl power is the way forward.\n\nMel says: \u201cI\u2019m close to all my kids. There\u2019s a female energy in our house and we play music, we cook together, it\u2019s a beautiful thing.\n\n\"All three of my kids are very, very different \u2013 they\u2019ve all got strong, independent, caring personalities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll find my 20-year-old posting something on Instagram and I\u2019ll be like, \u2018That is my outfit!\n\n\"'Those are my trousers that I wore in one of my Spice Girls videos. What are you raiding my wardrobe without asking?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Mel was Phoenix\u2019s age, bandmates Ginger, Posh, Baby and Sporty used to help her pick her outfits for dates.\n\nShe says: \u201cBack in the day, in my 20s, getting ready to go out for a date [involved] all the Spice Girls helping each other pick out the different clothes \u2013 but that was 20 years ago.\n\n\"From what I\u2019ve experienced so far on the podcast, it\u2019s a very different time to be dating!\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many dating apps, people have a lot more choice, but at least it\u2019s all out there in the open if you\u2019re really shy, or if you\u2019re a bit nervous to go up to that person and ask them out.\n\n\"My friend signed me up for an app two years ago and I found it very funny.\u201d\n\nMind you, Mel says she would rather stay at home and enjoy a cosy night in these days.\n\nShe admits: \u201cI\u2019ve never really been that girl that goes out and out and out, since I\u2019ve been 15 or 16, I\u2019ve always been the girl that opts to stay at home with my mum and have some dinner and watch TV.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really been like that \u2013 I\u2019ve been on the party scene, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I\u2019m very much a homebody.\n\n\"I\u2019m back in Leeds, looking outside my window at nature and sheep \u2013 it\u2019s lovely, very peaceful.\u201d\n\nAnd after a hectic few months following the Spice Girls reunion tour earlier this year, Mel says finding her inner calm is more important than ever.\n\nShe says: \u201cI\u2019ve always done meditation. I became a reiki master at 19, so I\u2019ve always been into the mind, body and soul, and making it feel good.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time to exercise every day so I do a quick meditation or do some reiki \u2013 even if you just take five or 10 minutes to do that, you feel much better and grounded.\u201d\n\n* The Truth Flirts is launched with dating app Badoo.
