It\u2019s trendy, maybe, but not glamorous. Of course, up until last year, \u201cslime green\u201d probably didn\u2019t feel all that glamorous either. So, let me posit that one of the color trends emerging from Paris Fashion Week was closest to a French\u2019s yellow, or maybe a grainy Dijon, as seen at Rick Owens, Margiela, Off-White, and more.\n\nDesigners have recently enjoyed using either rainbow brite colors, or exclusively muted neutrals. (Beige, anyone?) Mustard is different: It\u2019s bold, but also muddy. It\u2019s not neutral, but it does offset other shades surprisingly well. Take Rick Owens\u2019s show. Owens is known \u2060\u2014 above all \u2060\u2014 as a goth. But his show was uncharacteristically optimistic; there were bubbles, for god\u2019s sake. And amid all the black and white and gray, there were splashes of mustard, often accented with touches of bubblegum pink. Is mustard the color of goth happiness?\n\nAt Margiela, the mustard was paired with maroon. At Dries, mustard pants went with a red blazer. At Lanvin, a mustard trench offset an oxblood belt. Mustard makes everything better, without losing its own personal character \u2060\u2014 a statement you could make about the color, but also the condiment.\n\nMaison Margiela Photo: Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nDries Van Noten Photo: Pietro D\u2019Aprano/Getty Images\n\nLanvin Photo: Kristy Sparow/Getty Images for Lanvin\n\nRick Owens Photo: Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nRick Owens Photo: Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nOff-White Photo: Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images", "description": "While the biggest style icon for mustard was The Office\u2019s Dwight Schrute, it\u2019s made its way over to Rick Owens, Margiela, Off-White, and more at Paris Fashion Week.", "authors": ["Sarah Spellings"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/27/27-color-theory-mustard-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
