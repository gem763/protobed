With the NHS in crisis, the economy slipping into recession and the adverse impacts of austerity blighting lives and communities, we urgently need a change of direction.\n\nThe Tories meanwhile are drifting further into the realms of fantasy economics and diplomacy. Their increasingly shrill demands for a no-deal Brexit, encouraged by Boris Johnson\u2019s aping of Farage, clash with a parliament that is adamant it will not allow no deal to happen. As a result, a general election seems increasingly likely.\n\nGiven all that\u2019s at stake, if we do face a general election Labour needs to be ready to fight and win. We have a bold offer to the country in many policy areas \u2013 including the economy, tackling climate change and ending inequality. The truth is though that we will not get a hearing on any of these issues if we fail to offer a clear answer to the single most important political question of the era \u2013 are we Leave or Remain?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe time for sitting on the fence and trying to appeal to both sides has long gone. Brexit is the issue that defines our current politics, our party, the next general election and probably the next couple of decades of political debate. Failing to take a stand does not mean that we appeal to all voters \u2013 it means that we appeal to none.\n\nThe hard truth for those in positions of leadership in the Labour movement is that Labour is at heart a Remain party. Most of our members, voters and MPs are Remainers \u2013 we believe in internationalism and that we achieve more together than we do apart. We believe that the challenges of our age are best addressed by socialists, here and in Europe, cooperating to stop climate chaos and the dangerous far right populism that is represented by Farage and his allies.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Morally, Brexit would harm the communities we serve, manufacturing would be decimated, while whole industries, including the car industry and aerospace, could close, costing thousands of jobs.\n\nThere is also an electoral case to be made. The vast majority of polling over the last year has shown that Labour\u2019s only route to a majority is to take hold of the bulk of the Remain vote and add that to our Labour-loyalist vote. The possibility of building that coalition still exists, but the window is closing.\n\nThe voters want clarity. A fence sitting half-way house has already been shown to be a failure and is likely to split the Remain vote, probably leading to a Tory majority and a harder-than-ever Brexit. The possibility of a Brexit Party/Tory pact adds to the necessity to get this right. A split Remain vote, up against a united Leave vote, could result in a Tory/Brexit landslide along the lines of Thatcher\u2019s 1983 result, where her reduced vote share still led to seat gains due to the split on the left.\n\nThere is no doubt that the recent shift in position from the leadership is a significant move by the party and formerly opposed unions. Labour and union backing for Remain and a referendum on any Tory deal will gain us a hearing among some voters. This shift is a direct result of the campaigning done by pro Remain members and unions over the last year.\n\nHowever, while this move is welcome, to many it still seems like more prevarication. The TULO policy is clearly designed to give Labour something to say both to Leavers and Remainers. Leavers would get the prospect of a \u201cbetter Labour Brexit\u201d, while Remainers would get the promise of a referendum with Remain on the ballot. In theory this keeps everyone happy; in practice it will satisfy no one.\n\nA policy that commits to negotiating a new deal forgets that Brexit is increasingly about identity, not economic outcomes. Leavers want \u201ctheir country back\u201d, while Remainers want to live in an open, connected, confident nation that partners with others to the greater good. Any deal on Brexit \u2013 that isn\u2019t Remain or no deal \u2013 would fail to gain support from either group.\n\nThe new position seems doomed to again split the Remain vote as it did in the European elections with disastrous results for Labour, with polling still showing Labour trailing the Brexit Party, Tories and Lib Dems. It has become increasingly clear that only by arguing clearly for Remain in all circumstances can Labour reunify the coalition we need and create a voter base strong and widespread enough to beat the Tories.\n\nIt is beyond time that we stopped trying to hedge our bets and please all sides of this argument. Instead we must be upfront with the public about the disaster that Brexit has become. It\u2019s time to argue for Remain in all circumstances \u2013 to protect jobs and the NHS, to raise a banner for the vast majority of voters that would consider voting for us in the next election, and to have a hope of stopping a no deal Brexit and a Johnson election victory.\n\nMike Buckley is director of Labour for a Public Vote", "description": "Britain needs a Labour government.", "authors": ["Mike Buckley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/22/09/final-say-angela-7.jpg"}
