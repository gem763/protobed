It is written by Jean-Yves Ferri and drawn by Didier Conrad, the team behind the last three books. They have remained close to the original format started by the writer Ren\u00e9 Goscinny and cartoonist Albert Uderzo, who mentored both Conrad and Ferri.\n\nHowever, the creation of Adrenaline is a big leap away from the blonde, femme fatales who usually turn up in the Asterix comics.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to develop a character who would be based on her seductive side as we usually do with female characters in Asterix. Most of the time they are young attractive women who seduce Obelix and their role stops there,\u201d Conrad said.\n\n\u201c[She] has just finished growing, but hasn\u2019t fully developed yet, so everything that is feminine is focused on her face. At the beginning of the story she has the silhouette in the form of an \u2018S\u2019, so she\u2019s a bit round shouldered and grumpy, as she starts to assert herself, she stands up straight,\u201d he added.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Advertising for the new Asterix book, La fille de Vercingetorix, is pictured at the Frankfurt book fair.

However, this proves difficult for these two heroes, as her rebellious spirit disturbs the village\u2019s day-to-day life.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the vocabulary it was quite amusing because I had to create a sort of teenage language for the time. We don\u2019t have a lot of documentation about that. So the idea was to use certain expressions like teenagers do,\u201d said Ferri.\n\nGoing for Gaul: Mary Beard on 40 years of Asterix Read more\n\nIn reply to a reporter, Ferri and Conrad said the similarities between spirited Adrenaline and teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg were purely fortuitous.\n\nSet in 50BC in Roman-occupied Gaul, the Asterix books have become a mainstay in the publishing industry, with more than 370m copies sold worldwide.\n\nFive million copies of the French edition of Asterix and the Chieftain\u2019s Daughter have been printed, with 2m of those remaining in France where new Asterix books frequently top the bestseller charts.\n\nAs well as being translated into more than 100 languages, the books have inspired a dozen movies and cartoon series, making it a global phenomenon.", "description": "Asterix and the Chieftain\u2019s Daughter, released on Thursday, stars a rebellious teenage Gaul who keeps Asterix and Obelix on their toes", "authors": ["Sonali Nandi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cafc9c99a8ac6b284b23e2d297d0b0122ae3ddee/0_74_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc96923b0675c42c97e06b6673ba3eaf", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
