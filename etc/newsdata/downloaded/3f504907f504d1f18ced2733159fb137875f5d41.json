However, sentiment seemed buoyed on hopes of a partial deal despite Washington's move to blacklist Chinese companies.\n\nThe Chinese yuan <CNY=CFXS> reopened after a week long holiday to strengthen 0.3%.\n\n\"Hopes have emerged on trade talks, inspired by reports that Beijing is preparing to work through tough negotiations with the U.S., setting a time-line for the thorny issues,\" Vishnu Varathan, senior economist at Mizuho Bank said in a note.\n\nThe Philippine peso <PHP=> firmed 0.3% against the dollar, clawing back some of the losses from the previous session. The peso had weakened 0.4% on Monday amid caution ahead of the trade talks.\n\nThe Taiwan dollar <TWD=TP> strengthened 0.3%. Data showed that the island's equity markets received about $2.9 billion of foreign investment in September, on optimism over its economy, as a growing number of local firms were shifting their factories to Taiwan from mainland China.\n\nThe South Korean won <KRW=KFTC> firmed 0.2% after better than expected third quarter forecast from the world's biggest semiconductor firm, Samsung Electronics <005930.KS>, reduced concerns over South Korea's exports.\n\nMeanwhile, the Thai Baht <THB=TH> bucked the trend to weaken about 0.1%. The baht has shown resilience by strengthening by the most among Asian units so far this year.\n\nIndian financial markets were closed for a holiday.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Shreya Mariam Job in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "description": "Prospects for progress in U.S.-China trade talks dimmed on Monday after Washington blacklisted Chinese companies but comments by U.S. President Donald Trump and his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow on looming trade talks were generally upbeat.  \"We think there's a chance we could do something", "authors": ["Shreya Mariam Job"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TdhAOWhakGGFbCMDYAxQJg--~B/aD0yOTk7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/d1d60c7e7fff6b7d7adccc85e1c4c86f", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
