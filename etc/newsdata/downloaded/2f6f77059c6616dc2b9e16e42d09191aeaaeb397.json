Giuliani and a cast of former Ukrainian officials who viewed her as a threat to their financial and political interests.\n\nShe told lawmakers that she was forced to leave Kiev on \u201cthe next plane\u201d this spring and subsequently removed from her post, with the State Department\u2019s No. 2 official telling her that, although she had done nothing wrong, the president had lost confidence in her and the agency had been under significant pressure to remove her since the summer of 2018.\n\n[Read Marie Yovanovitch\u2019s prepared deposition statement]\n\nIn explaining her departure, she acknowledged months of criticisms from Giuliani, who had accused her of privately badmouthing the president and seeking to protect the interests of former vice president Joe Biden and his son who served on the board of Ukrainian energy company.\n\nYovanovitch denied those allegations and said she was \u201cincredulous\u201d that her superiors decided to remove her based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d She also took direct aim at Giuliani\u2019s associates whom she said could have been financially threatened by her anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nThe former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, arrives on Capitol Hill for a closed-door deposition before the House Intelligence Committee. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nNeither the White House nor the State Department immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nGiuliani stood by his allegations in a phone call with The Washington Post, saying Ukrainians told him that Yovanovitch was \u201crunning around the streets saying not to listen to Trump.\u201d He declined to say precisely who told him that.\n\nThe remarkable statements by a diplomat with more than 30 years in the Foreign Service came amid rising dissatisfaction inside the State Department at what is seen as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s failure to defend his subordinates who have become targets in the Ukraine controversy. Michael McKinley, a career diplomat and senior adviser to Pompeo, resigned from his post this week as resentment in the building has grown.\n\nHer testimony could also increase calls for the president\u2019s impeachment as Yovanovitch detailed her belief that under Trump\u2019s leadership, U.S. foreign policy has been compromised by self-interested actors who have badly demoralized and depleted America\u2019s diplomatic corps.\n\n\u201cToday, we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within,\u201d she said, warning that U.S. adversaries such as Russia stand to benefit \u201cwhen bad actors in countries beyond Ukraine see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system.\u201d\n\n[Michael McKinley, senior adviser to Pompeo, resigns State Dept. post]\n\nYovanovitch is one of several current and former diplomats whom the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees have identified as witnesses in their probe of whether Trump leveraged U.S. military aid and official diplomatic interaction to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nShe arrived on Capitol Hill with a swagger uncommon for many witnesses who have appeared before the panels investigating Trump, appearing for her deposition past its scheduled start time and choosing to walk across the Capitol grounds with her legal team rather than driving up to one of the building\u2019s entrances.\n\nAccording to House Democratic leaders, the State Department attempted to block Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony Thursday night, directing her not to attend the voluntary interview, in keeping with a White House letter this week stating that the administration would not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee responded with a subpoena Friday morning, panel leaders said, noting that \u201cthe illegitimate order from the Trump Administration not to cooperate has no force.\u201d\n\nThe exchange \u2014 along with an announcement earlier Friday by the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, indicating he would appear for a deposition under subpoena next week \u2014 suggests that House Democrats may have to issue summonses to interview government officials, particularly if doing so could jeopardize witnesses\u2019 employment. With a subpoena in hand, officials who are otherwise willing to testify can circumvent the White House\u2019s stated prohibition on cooperation with the impeachment probe.\n\nThe White House issued talking points to congressional Republicans, saying, \u201cWe are not concerned with any information Yovanovitch might share, because the President did nothing wrong.\u201d But in a potential warning to other officials considering cooperating with the impeachment inquiry, the White House talking points say that because Yovanovitch did not appear with State Department lawyers counseling her about what she was permitted to say, \u201cthere is serious danger that she could breach her obligations as a current employee not to reveal such information without authorization.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt raises serious questions,\u201d the talking points state, as to why House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the Democrats\u2019 point man for the impeachment inquiry, \u201cis willing to put career officials in such risky situations while bullying them with legally unfounded threats of obstruction charges.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch was expected to face questions about Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Soviet-born associates of Giuliani\u2019s who were arrested Wednesday on charges of campaign finance violations. According to an indictment that federal prosecutors unsealed Thursday, the men were working for Ukrainian officials to remove Yovanovitch from her job.\n\nYovanovitch had made some enemies in Ukraine through her efforts to bolster the country\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, an institution launched in 2014 aimed at fighting endemic graft and corruption. The bureau particularly angered Ukraine\u2019s recently fired prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who has accused Yovanovitch of inappropriately interfering in Ukrainian politics, though he subsequently retracted one of his most inflammatory accusations, that she provided him a \u201cdo not prosecute list.\u201d\n\nIn her testimony, Yovanovitch stressed that she never directed anyone to \u201crefrain from investigating or prosecuting actual corruption,\u201d according to her prepared remarks.\n\nU.S. officials who worked closely with Yovanovitch said her swift ouster stunned career diplomats who had been planning high-level internal meetings for her that were scrapped because she would no longer be serving in the position. \u201cThey fired her in the most dishonorable way imaginable,\u201d said one former State Department official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal processes.\n\nPompeo did not personally notify her of her removal, officials said. That job instead went to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who Trump said Friday would be nominated as U.S. ambassador to Russia. In her prepared remarks, Yovanovitch said that Sullivan told her \u201cI had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.\u201d\n\nSullivan did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe panels have issued subpoenas to the White House, Giuliani, his business associates Parnas and Fruman, and several Cabinet-level officials \u2014 including Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought \u2014 requesting materials related to the administration\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n\nBeyond Yovanovitch, the panels have recorded only one other deposition to date, with former special U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who quit his post hours after he was requested to appear for a deposition. At his session this month, Volker turned over a series of text messages he exchanged with Giuliani, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and senior U.S. diplomats including Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the E.U.\n\n[Officials\u2019 texts reveal belief that Trump wanted probes as condition of Ukraine meeting]\n\nSondland\u2019s lawyers, Robert Luskin and Kwame Manley, said Friday that Sondland intended to comply with the subpoena and appear before the committees next Thursday, although he would not turn over the documents lawmakers have requested.\n\n\u201cBy federal law and regulation, the State Department has sole authority to produce such documents, and Ambassador Sondland hopes the materials will be shared with the Committees in advance of his Thursday testimony,\u201d his lawyers said in a statement.\n\nVolker\u2019s text messages pertain to the weeks before and after a July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, in which the American president asked his Ukrainian counterpart to look into the purported involvement of Ukrainians in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the role that former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden played on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma.\n\nDemocrats have seized on how Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor, though\u201d when the Ukrainian president brought up the subject of military aid that had been withheld, according to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House. Democrats allege that is evidence of a quid pro quo and an abuse of office.\n\nZelensky won the Ukrainian presidential election in April and took office on May 20, the same day Yovanovitch was recalled.\n\nJosh Dawsey, Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report.", "description": "Yovanovitch, who was recalled from her posting in Ukraine, is meeting with House impeachment investigators.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Paul Sonne", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The U.S. Military", "October At Pm", "John Hudson Is A National Security Reporter At The Washington Post Covering The State Department", "Diplomacy.
