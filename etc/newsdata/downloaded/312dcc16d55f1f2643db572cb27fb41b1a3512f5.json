Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said 342 \u201cterrorists\u201d \u2014 Ankara\u2019s term for Syrian Kurdish militiamen \u2014 have been killed so far. The figure could not be independently verified. Syrian activists say only eight fighters were killed.\n\nThe Kurdish militia has fired dozens of mortars into border towns inside Turkey in the past two days, including Akcakale, according to officials in two provinces on the Turkish side. They said at least nine civilians were killed, including a 9-month-old boy and three girls under 15.\n\nMourners in Akcakale carried the coffin of the slain boy, Mohammed Omar Saar, as many shouted, \u201cDamn the PKK!\u201d referring to the Kurdish insurgent group in Turkey linked to Syrian Kurdish fighters. The PKK is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and other countries.\n\nThe latest attack hit the town of Suruc, and a child in the town of Ceylanpinar died of his wounds Thursday night, the Anadolu Agency reported.\n\nOn the Syrian side, seven civilians have been killed since Wednesday, activists said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said he doubts that the Turkish army has enough resources to take control of prison camps in the region housing Islamic State detainees, and he fears the captured fighters \u201ccould just run away,\u201d leading to a revival of the militant group.\n\n\u201cWe have to be aware of this and mobilize the resources of our intelligence to undercut this emerging tangible threat,\u201d Putin said during a visit to Turkmenistan.\n\nThe Syrian Kurdish forces had been holding more than 10,000 IS members, but they said they are being forced to abandon some of those positions to fight the Turkish invasion.\n\nIn Washington, chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said Defense Secretary Mark Esper \u201cmade clear\u201d in a phone call Thursday with his Turkish counterpart that the U.S. opposes the incursion.\n\nEsper told his counterpart that the military actions \u201cplace at risk\u201d the progress made to defeat the extremists and he urged Turkey to stop its operation, according to Hoffman. Esper also said the incursion \u201crisks serious consequences\u201d for Turkey, and he expressed his concern that it could harm U.S. personnel in Syria.\n\nSeparately, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged Ankara to exercise restraint, although he acknowledged what he said was Turkey\u2019s legitimate security concerns about the Syrian Kurdish fighters.\n\nIn a joint news conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Stoltenberg also expressed worry that the Turkish offensive could \u201cjeopardize\u201d gains made against IS. Cavusoglu said Turkey expected solidarity from its allies.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough to say you understand Turkey\u2019s legitimate concerns, we want to see this solidarity in a clear way,\u201d he said.\n\nEuropean Union Council chief Donald Tusk said Turkey\u2019s operation is of \u201cgrave concern.\u201d Abandoning the Kurdish fighters who have been crucial in the fight against IS \u201cis not only a bad idea\u201d but raises many \u201cquestions both of a strategic and moral nature,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nHe said a threat by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to \u201copen the gates\u201d and let Syrian refugees flood into Europe was \u201ctotally out of place,\u201d adding that the EU will never accept \u201cthat refugees are weaponized and used to blackmail us.\u201d\n\nAm\u00e9lie de Montchalin, the French secretary for European affairs, said sanctions against Turkey will be \u201con the table\u201d at next week\u2019s European Union summit because of the incursion, telling France Inter radio that Europe should respond to what she described as a shocking situation against civilians and the Kurdish fighters in Syria.\n\nEuropean diplomats in Brussels have responded cautiously to the idea of sanctions, even though Turkey\u2019s actions have been met with near-unanimous criticism.\n\nThe Turkish assault aims to create a corridor of control along Turkey\u2019s border \u2014 a so-called \u201csafe zone\u201d \u2014 clearing out the Syrian Kurdish fighters. Such a zone would end the Kurds\u2019 autonomy in the area and put much of their population under Turkish control. Ankara wants to settle 2 million Syrian refugees, mainly Arabs, in the zone.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency said tens of thousands of people have fled their homes since Wednesday, while the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, put the figure at more than 60,000.\n\nSyrian Kurdish authorities evacuated people from the Mabrouka camp, located west of the town of Ras al-Ayn, because of artillery rounds falling in the area, according to the local Kurdish-led administration.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if there were any injuries in the camp for displaced residents, located 12 kilometers, or 7 miles, from the border.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said the fighting has forced it to shut down one of the hospitals it supports in the border town of Tal Abyad that served more than 200,000 people. The violence forced most of the town\u2019s residents to leave, including the medical staff and their family, leaving the group little choice but to close the facility, according to the group, known by its French acronym as MSF.\n\nIt said aid groups had to suspend or limit operations in the crowded al-Hol camp, home to more than 70,000 women and children located 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Turkish border, as well as the Ain Eissa camp.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cb/4f/35b04c08407a9b092836f3060fd6/191011-syria-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
