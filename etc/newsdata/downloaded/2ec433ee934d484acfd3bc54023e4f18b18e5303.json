They never ask for any thanks and are just the best people ever,' he posted.\n\nMr Cincotta was among the first to publicly back the victims of the Bourke Street massacre.\n\nThe fund, which closed in June 2017, went onto raise $1.5 million by well meaning Australians.\n\nUnder the name Enruoblem, which is Melbourne spelled backwards, Mr Cincotta put together a double CD featuring Melbourne buskers, which became a huge hit.\n\nAll of the money raised from sales was to go directly into the Bourke Street fund.\n\nIn February that year, Mr Cincotta took to his Facebook page Humans in Melbourne to declare $28,163 had been raised.\n\nMore than $39,000 was raised by hard working Aussies to help fund Chris Cincotta's charity Enruoblem. But the charity has never been registered and it remains unclear what, if anything, it contributes\n\n'Hate may have shredded our hearts, but love is helping put them back together,' he posted.\n\nBut not all of that money made it into the fund.\n\nThe lawyer assisting the relatives of the Bourke Street tragedy told Daily Mail Australia they would all be outraged.\n\n'All victims would, I am sure, wish that swift prosecutions take place for any fraud of the victims fund,' Michael Lombard, of Adviceline Injury Lawyers, said:\n\nHard working Australians also contributed $39,708 to Mr Cincotta to establish the charity, which he claimed would be used mostly towards charities and organisations in Melbourne 'doing good for the city'.\n\nChris Cincotta (right) raised money to help the victims of the Bourke Street massacre, but not all of it has been passed on\n\nIn 2016, the then Weekly Review - formerly owned by Fairfax - handed his charity $10,000 as part of its 'Local Heroes' awards.\n\nBack then, Mr Cincotta said the charity would be donating cash to local charities 'really soon', but little to anyone has seen any of the cash.\n\nHe pledged to help the arts such as photography, street art and music and spend 20 per cent on 'random acts of kindness'.\n\nOn Thursday night, Mr Cincotta told his Humans in Melbourne followers - all 220,000 - that he had left the remaining funds from the Bourke Street fund in the EnroubleM account.\n\n'And that\u2019s where they have been since, waiting for the right cause and time to donate them,' he wrote.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has asked Mr Cincotta for the charity's bank statements dating back to January 2017, but Mr Cincotta failed to respond.\n\nHe did provide a copy of a bank statement which shows $20,495.15 was transferred out of an account named Bourke Street Memorial Benefit on February 8, 2017.\n\nSearches of the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profit register and Victorian Consumer Affairs revealed no existence of the charity EnruobleM.\n\nMr Cincotta denied the charity had raised almost $40,000, despite the figure still being posted online on a funding site.\n\nMuch of the money was raised by the sale of watches branded with his charity name.\n\nAlthough, some claim their watches never arrived.\n\n'Have others received their watches I am still waiting for mine and am not getting any response to my messages to Chris,' one man claimed three years ago.\n\n'I am still waiting on my watch as well. :/ any idea whats going on?' another states.\n\nDaily Mail Australia contacted Mr Cincotta again on Friday to ask him how many people actually got a watch, but he did not reply.\n\nEarlier, Mr Cincotta said he always had honest intentions and it is not suggested otherwise.\n\n'It's just sitting there. It's never been touched and we have the complete intention of always going to pay a charity that is similar to the Bourke Street fund - maybe something to do with people recovering from a terrorist act or something like that.'\n\nThe only website that appears to exist for the unregistered charity is a Facebook page that hasn't been touched since 2016.\n\nMr Cincotta said the charity had funded 'book bags' for a charity named MET and they got 'a guy a car' who was living rough.\n\n'That's pretty much what we've done,' he said.\n\nChris Cincotta had closed up shop when James Gargasoulas drove down Swanston onto Bourke Street where he killed six people, including a baby. Mr Cincotta has admitted he still has some of the cash donated to a fund to help victims\n\nJames Gargasoulas' killed six people with his car on Bourke Street. He was jailed for life\n\nIt did not go unnoticed by Daily Mail Readers that since Mr Cincotta has held onto the remaining Bourke Street fund money, there have been several terror attacks in Melbourne, including one on Bourke Street itself.\n\n'He said he was holding onto the money in case there was something like another terrorist attack, ' one reader said. 'There was! And he still didn't hand the money over.'\n\n'Profiting from the death of innocents. Stunning and brave,' another wrote.\n\nQuestions were also asked about what happened to the money raised from watch sales through EnruobleM.\n\nOne prominent fundraiser, who in the close knit world of charity asked to remain anonymous, told Daily Mail Australia people were surprised to hear the money hadn't been handed over.\n\n'Charities and funds need to be mindful that money donated is donated for that particular cause and needs to be sent in as soon as possible,' the person said.\n\n'Not saved for a rainy day or used for any other means than what the donor intended.'\n\nChris Cincotta rates himself as a photographer. He posts his photos on Instagram and Facebook and is now selling books of his work\n\nChris Cincotta was selling watches under the Enruoblem charity name. He claims some of the money from the charity goes on 'random acts of kindness'\n\nWhen contacted on Thursday afternoon, Mr Cincotta told Daily Mail Australia he raised the cash through EnruobleM and donated 'every cent from the day' into the Bourke Street fund.\n\n'The money that was raised through the website, because the CD continued to sell, I naively went: 'I'll put the money in the fund when it's ready\". And by the time it came that I was to put the money in the fund it was closed,' he said.\n\nMr Cincotta claimed he planned to put the money into another fund 'along the same lines'.\n\n'So literally the money has been sitting in an EnruobleM account ever since and it hasn't been used and it hasn't been touched at all,' he said.\n\nMr Cincotta claimed all that remains of the cash he held onto was 'about $4000' after the costs of the CDs and postage.\n\nThalia Hakin (pictured) was only 10 years old when she was killed during the Bourke Street rampage\n\nHe hit his Humans in Melbourne Facebook page on Thursday night after being contacted by Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'The next day, all the money raised on the streets was donated directly to the Bourke Street Fund - an incredible $20,497! The money from the CDs sold online entered the EnruobleM account, ready to be transferred to the fund,' he wrote.\n\n'I decided not to transfer the remainder until I knew the total amount raised from online supporters.'\n\nMr Cincotta told his followers he had lawyers draw up papers to incorporate Enruoblem and register it as a charity so that 'we can do as much good in Melbourne and Victoria as possible'.\n\nHe then called on followers to ask how he should spend the remaining funds from the Bourke Street fundraising initiative.\n\nHis followers were gushing in their praise, urging him 'not to be too hard on himself'.\n\nMr Cincotta's face was splashed across the land in newspapers and television reports as a beacon for everything good about Melbourne after the atrocity on Bourke Street in January 2017.\n\nSix people were killed in the attack, including three-month-old baby Zachary Bryant, who was thrown 60 metres from his pram, and 10-year-old girl Thalia Hakin.\n\nIn February, James Gargasoulas was jailed for life with a non-parole period of 46 years in jail for the crime, which was described as one of Australia\u2019s 'worst examples of mass murder'.\n\n'I promise I was doing it with the best intentions you could ever have and nothing has ever been misappropriated at all - I swear to you man,' Mr Cincotta said.\n\nHis popularity rose on the back a small booth he opened in the heart of Melbourne in 2014, from where he sold his photos.\n\nWhile chatting to locals, he came with an idea to create a Facebook page copying the world-famous Humans of New York page.\n\nThe Humans in Melbourne page has gone on to have more than 220,000 'likes' on Facebook while his Instagram account melbourneiloveyou has close to 79,000.\n\nBourke Street mass murderer James Gargasoulas, 29, is pictured at the Supreme Court in Melbourne last year", "description": "A city icon who became the face of a heartbroken Melbourne in the days following the Bourke Street massacre has been cleaning up on freebies and handouts.", "authors": ["Wayne Flower In Melbourne For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/04/19869008-0-image-a-20_1571370868098.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
