When you build one app like this that puts everything together in one place, it makes people want to get rid of their cars. If a pizza comes to you in 15 minutes, why couldn\u2019t a car?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m in a restaurant in Helsinki called Yes Yes Yes, listening to Sampo Hietanen, the CEO and founder of Finnish start-up MaaS Global, who invented the Whim transportation app, one of a new breed of smart apps in the city.\n\nHelsinki (along with France\u2019s Lyon) is one of the first cities to be selected from 38 contenders as a European Smart Tourism Capital, part of a new EU-wide annual competition. In order for a city to be considered, it needs to demonstrate outstanding achievements in four categories: accessibility, sustainability, digitalisation and cultural heritage and creativity.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI\u2019m already marvelling at their creativity in this restaurant for managing to make turnips exciting (served with garum mayo and Jerusalem artichoke vinaigrette). It\u2019s my first time in Finland, having visited all the Nordic countries previously, and I\u2019m trying to put my finger on what makes Helsinki different. While the Finns are very proud of having one of the world\u2019s first smart capitals, it seems to be less of a let\u2019s-blow-our-own-trumpet-about-new-technology attitude and more of a natural recognition of how life is made easier through listening to people\u2019s needs.\n\nThis, combined with a natural offbeat quirkiness, leads to some fabulous results. My favourite personal example of this can be seen in the giant SkyWheel on the waterfront, which one would assume is like any other capital city\u2019s ferris wheel. But why is one of the gondolas brown? Oh, that\u2019d be the SkySauna. Elsewhere, happy pictures of women can be found all over the Market Square: they\u2019re the \u201cMarthas\u201d. Essentially grandmothers for everybody, they\u2019re available to give free advice on matters spanning home economics to Finnish family and society.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But they\u2019re determined to make it even easier with the Whim app (nicknamed \u201cthe Netflix of transport\u201d), which offers a subscription service to all transport (bike rental, taxi, car hire, trains, trams). I\u2019d already been impressed by the app\u2019s ability earlier that morning to assume that I wanted to cheat my way around Helsinki\u2019s public transport. Initially I couldn\u2019t finish installing the app because, on arrival in Finland, I\u2019d manually adjusted the settings on my phone to ensure the clock display was on Helsinki time. The Whim app needs your phone\u2019s time settings to \u201cautomatically update\u201d, presumably because most people who use it here are locals, not those with a UK network. This ensures that when I buy a ticket that\u2019s valid for 80 minutes, I don\u2019t get to tinker around with the time to make it last all day on my phone.\n\nWhen I decided to take a screenshot of my ticket in case I lost access to wifi, the Whim app wouldn\u2019t let me do that either. The ticket needs to be \u201cactive\u201d, with its little swirl rotating. Fortunately, free wifi access is pretty solid across Helsinki\u2019s public transport network, which is another boon. Helsinki: 2, Me: 0 (even though I wasn\u2019t deliberately trying to outsmart their app). Having just one device that covers absolutely all transport options seems like something incredibly tricky to organise, yet somehow the Finns have managed it.\n\nThings trip up a bit on the summer island of Lonna, where I was introduced to the Virtual Helsinki headset, built using 3D modelling by the City of Helsinki in partnership with VR studio Zoan. I\u2019d like to think that the headset being glitchy was related to the circumstances (I\u2019d recommend the Lonna craft beer), but the technology didn\u2019t seem to want to play that day. The idea is to present a complete digital experience of Helsinki for visitors, with realistic water and wooden surfaces captured in high resolution to sense the city in a new way, complete with changing seasons. I can attest to a traditional sauna and dip in the Baltic at Lonna being your next best realistic water and wooden surface experience, however.\n\nBecoming an EU Smart Tourism city involves not just meeting existing criteria but having clear plans in place to continue to develop initiatives. Helsinki is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2030, and my head spins a bit when I visit the new neighbourhood of Kalasatama where this utopian future is being built. Wandering about this kind of manufactured, very neat, artfully designed suburb (the film The Truman Show crossed my mind), felt a little surreal. Currently home to 3,000 residents (25,000 projected by 2035), this Smart City pilot project, has an \u201curban lab\u201d, designing ways for its people to not just live sustainably but to gain an extra hour of free time a day by doing away with the frustrating aspects of life, such as queueing, commuting and grocery shopping. One tangible example of this pleasantness at work is that no one will ever be woken up by a rubbish collection truck: everyone in this community has access to an underground air-tube system that sucks everything away at 70kmph to a central processing facility. Residents still need to sort the rubbish into five various streams and take it to the above-ground portal on each block where it\u2019s recycled or converted to biogas, but there\u2019s a definite virtuous efficiency aspect to the whole scenario.\n\nReturning to the airport using the Whim app involves an easy tram ride to the Central Station, where I once again admire the world\u2019s most beautiful Burger King in its Art Nouveau building, followed by a sparkling clean train, full of ridiculously happy children dancing their way to a field excursion. Much as a rebellious part of me wants to roughen up the pristine, somewhat manufactured atmosphere of the do-good Kalasatama neighbourhood, there\u2019s also a grudging respect for everything they\u2019re trying to achieve. While the rest of the world burns, Helsinki may be blissfully sauna-ing in its carbon neutrality by 2030.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nFinnair flies direct from London Heathrow to Helsinki from \u00a399 return.\n\nStaying there\n\nMarski by Scandi has recently had a refurbishment and is renowned for its cocktail bar. From \u20ac218, room only.\n\nIf you have your heart set on a sauna in your room, then Lapland Hotels Boulevard is for you.
