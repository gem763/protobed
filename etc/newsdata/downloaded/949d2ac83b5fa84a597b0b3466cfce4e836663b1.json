It currently hosts 3.6 million Syrians sheltering from the more than eight-year-old conflict in their homeland.\n\nAfter the statements, Turkey's lira TRYTOM=D3 was trading weaker at 5.7150 against the U.S. dollar, compared with a close of 5.70 on Friday. After the Erdogan-Trump phone call, the Turkish presidency said the two leaders had agreed to meet in Washington next month.\n\nIt said that during the call Erdogan had expressed his frustration with the failure of U.S. military and security officials to implement the agreement between the two countries.\n\nThe NATO allies agreed in August to establish a zone in northeast Syria along the border with Turkey.\n\nTurkey says the United States moved too slowly to set up the zone. It has repeatedly warned of launching an offensive on its own into northeast Syria.\n\nTies between the allies have also been pressured over Turkey\u2019s purchase of Russian S-400 defense missiles and the trial of local U.S. consulate employees in Turkey.", "description": "The United States said it was pulling troops from northeast Syria, in a major shift which clears the way for a Turkish military offensive against Kurdish-led forces and hands Turkey responsibility for thousands of Islamic State captives.", "authors": ["Daren Butler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437929409&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950MG", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
