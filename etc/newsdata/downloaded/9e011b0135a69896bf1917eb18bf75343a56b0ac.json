He is the subject of a new movie, \u201cReady for War,\u201d about deported U.S. veterans. (1996-98 AccuSoft Inc., All rights reserved/Credit: Toronto International Film Festival)\n\nTORONTO \u2014 Hector Barajas, a U.S. Army veteran, spent years trying to get back into the United States after being unexpectedly deported to Mexico in 2004.\n\nIt turns out his border battles weren\u2019t over.\n\nBarajas, who served in the Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne Division, was denied entry late Friday to Canada where he was to appear at a film festival to tell his story. Saturday evening, Canadian border authorities allowed him in, but offered no explanation for why he was kept out in the first place and did not reply to a request for clarification on its later decision.\n\nBarajas is a principal subject of \u201cReady for War,\u201d a documentary set to make its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sunday. The movie, which counts the rapper Drake as an executive producer, tells of the hundreds of U.S. green-card holders deported to Mexico after serving overseas in the U.S. armed forces.\n\nBarajas, who now lives in Los Angeles after 14 years in exile in Mexico and is now a U.S. citizen, was denied entry to Canada as he sought to drive across the New York-Ontario border. It was a surprise development that illustrates the capriciousness of border policies the movie seeks to document.\n\n\u201cThis is emblematic of the life that Hector and many others like him have to live,\u201d Andrew Renzi, the film\u2019s director, who has been in close touch with Barajas, said from a hotel here Saturday morning. \u201cA man lives a life of altruistic service, and he\u2019s repaid by a border policy that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nRenzi said Barajas spent Friday night at a Buffalo-area motel before trying again to enter Canada.\n\nJudith Gadbois-St-Cyr, a spokeswoman for Canada\u2019s Border Services Agency, said that as a matter of law the agency does not \u201cprovide comment or provide details on specific individual cases\u201d but added that \u201cAdmissibility of all travelers is decided on a case-by-case basis and based on the information made available at the time of entry. Several factors are used in determining if an individual is admissible to Canada, including involvement in criminal activity, human rights violations, organized crime, security, health or financial reasons.\u201d\n\nThom Powers, who runs the documentary section at TIFF, as the festival is known, did not reply to a request for comment. Showtime, which is planning to broadcast the film later this year, confirmed that Barajas had been allowed into Canada and would appear Sunday at the screening. It was unknown if Canadian authorities had discussed Barajas\u2019 situation with U.S. counterparts.\n\nBarajas was allowed to return to the United States in 2017 and was granted U.S. citizenship in 2018.\n\nThe movie examines the Mexican-born, U.S. veterans \u2014 Renzi said there are thousands; ICE has not provided official numbers \u2014 who believed they would automatically be given citizenship after enlisting. The men and women completed their service and were honorably discharged.\n\nBut as the film shows, the veterans were deported. The events unfolded after they served jail time for crimes committed after their service. But where U.S. citizens would simply be released after serving jail time, these veterans were sent to Mexico.\n\nUpon arriving south of the border, many of the veterans , still suffering from PTSD, fall into homelessness or addiction. Others are recruited by drug cartels, who covet their military training. Renzi and his team embedded in Juarez and other parts of Mexico with the cartels. One man known as El Vet, is also a key figure in the film; he is shown using his gun training to kill for a cartel.\n\nBarajas took a different path. His family emigrated from a Mexican farming community to Compton, Calif., when he was seven. He enlisted, seeking a brighter future than the one his neighborhood afforded.\n\nBarajas was convicted of discharging a firearm, served his sentence and was deported upon release. After arriving in Tijuana he fell into addiction before seeking help and recovering. He has since started a center for deported veterans in Mexico known as \u201cThe Bunker\u201d that provides counseling and job training, among other services.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be. You served in the military. How can they deport you?\u201d Barajas says in the film, which The Post was shown. \u201cI still consider myself an American, a patriot; I will keep fighting to go home. I\u2019m proud of my service. I wouldn\u2019t take it back if I had to do it all over again. I would serve my country, put my life on the line.\u201d\n\nIn the film, before he is granted entry back into the U.S., the veteran is shown for years as separated from his daughter, in grade school in Southern California; he is forced to Skype with her as their sole means of contact.\n\nHe was allowed to return to the United States after California Gov. Jerry Brown pardoned him on the weapons charge.\n\nTammy Duckworth, the Democratic U.S senator from Illinois who served and was wounded in Iraq, said the issue of deported veterans remains a black mark on the country\u2019s immigration policy\n\n\u201cMost Americans would be surprised to know that we deport veterans,\u201d Duckworth, herself born in Thailand, says in the film. \u201cWe now have a population of American veterans who are still deserving of veterans benefits who can\u2019t get access to them and can\u2019t even come back to the country that they defended.\u201d\n\nThe movie shows the efforts of Duckworth and Nathan Fletcher, a veteran and former California assemblyman behind the group Honorably Discharged, Dishonorably Deported, to bring back the veterans. (It usually involves seeking a pardon, which expunges the record and reverses the deportation; that is the )\n\nDrake became involved with the film after his managers were made aware of the teaser via Renzi\u2019s editor, Ben Wolin. The rapper is expected to appear on the red carpet for the film Sunday.\n\nRenzi says the issue transcends the divide of Democrats and Republicans. The policy of deporting veterans for crimes \u201cof moral turpitude\u201d began under President Bill Clinton and has continued under administrations from both parties.\n\nHe does believe the tougher enforcement policies of ICE during the Trump era have given some vets a harder road. One subject in the film, a diehard Bears and Cubs fan from Chicago named Miguel Perez, was recently deported. Renzi believes he faced a more aggressive process because Trump-era ICE did not want to appear to go easy on subjects.\n\n\u201cThis is a bipartisan offense that, wildly enough, can be a bipartisan fix,\u201d Renzi said. \u201cRight now the immigration conversation is exhausting, loud and confusing for a lot of people. This feels very specific \u2014 and something people on the right and left can get behind, because it involves veterans and Mexican-Americans.\u201d\n\nThe solution, he said, could begin with Barajas being granted entry to Canada.", "description": "A subject of a new documentary about immigration is facing his own border nightmare", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S.", "September At Pm", "Steven Zeitchik Covers The Business Of Entertainment For The Washington Post", "Examining The Industry'S Trends", "Challenges", "Issues", "Ideas.
