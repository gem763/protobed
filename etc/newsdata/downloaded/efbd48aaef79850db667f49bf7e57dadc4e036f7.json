In it, she detailed how she was walking through the parking lot of the H Street store on July 3, 2018, when she heard a woman scream \u201cPlease don\u2019t take that!\u201d and saw a teenager \u2014 a purse snatcher, she later learned \u2014 jump into the back of a white Volkswagen Jetta. She described how she watched the car barrel toward the exit ramp where she stood, slow down for a brief moment and, when she didn\u2019t move, speed up. She held on to the hood as it accelerated up the ramp.\n\n\u201cGripping onto the hood, my left foot caught the pavement under the car, snapping the bone that connects my leg to my foot,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAn unfamiliar howl emanated out of me that haunts me when I think about it now. Even that sound, coupled with the look of horror on my face, did not affect the increasing speed of the driver. Unfazed, he accelerated more.\u201d\n\n\n\nSurgeons used two titanium screws to repair Nasreen Alkhateeb\u2019s ankle. (Nasreen Alkhateeb)\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful essay that touches on how she saw the worst and the best in strangers that day. After I read it last year, I reached out to Nasreen to ask whether she was willing to publicly share what happened to her. She wasn\u2019t.\n\nMore than a year later, I finally learned why. The reason she couldn\u2019t speak then is the same reason she feels compelled to talk now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a really rough time in terms of identifying as someone who is broken, who is disabled,\u201d she tells me on a recent afternoon.\n\n\u201cI always saw myself as someone who could do anything,\u201d the 38-year-old says. \u201cIf I put my mind to something, there was nothing I couldn\u2019t do. That idea, that belief is still there, but now I have this other thing to think about. I think I\u2019m still coming to terms with the idea that although my body can\u2019t do all the things it did before, I still can. I just have to find another way of doing things.\u201d\n\nSome people are born with their disabilities. Others grow into them with age. Nasreen gained hers in that third way \u2014 abruptly, during an otherwise mundane moment. It happened as ice cream sat in her car.\n\nShe had just bought groceries from Mom\u2019s Organic Market, but the store\u2019s water dispenser was broken. She figured she would run into the nearby Whole Foods, fill three gallon-size bottles and be back home before anything melted.\n\n[On their own, but not alone: How a group of men with autism found an independence their families weren\u2019t sure they would ever have]\n\nThe incident changed that plan, and much more in the year that followed.\n\nBefore the incident, she was a filmmaker, named NASA\u2019s cinematographer of the year in 2016. She was used to lugging heavy equipment, squatting to get just the right shot and standing on her feet for hours. She also lived in an apartment that required walking up 49 stairs.\n\nAfter the incident, she lay in a hospital bed, staring at a foot she could no longer move. Photos from that day show a large bulge on her ankle and her arms and legs covered in scrapes where her skin rubbed against the road when she rolled off the car. She says she held on until it reached the street and she realized it would only go faster. She repeated the license plate until someone wrote it down, but she says no arrests have been made. A police report supports her description of how the car struck her and notes her broken foot.\n\nNasreen explains that the bone connecting her foot to her leg didn\u2019t just break. It broke in a way that was jagged and complete. Surgeons used two titanium screws to hold it in place, but she says it probably won\u2019t ever be the same.\n\nA year later, she still uses a cane and sometimes a scooter to get around. She also moved out of her apartment because getting up and down the stairs proved too exhausting.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m negotiating every single little thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m negotiating how much I\u2019m drinking, so I don\u2019t have to go to the bathroom six times a day. I\u2019m negotiating if I can make it to this industry event because there are 20 stairs and there is no handrail.\u201d\n\nShe also looks differently at how people with disabilities are talked about and portrayed. She says has always been conscious of diversity in her work. She identifies as a \u201cmulticultural, woman of color\u201d who is a survivor of assault and war. When she was 9 years old, the New York Times wrote about how she and her father ended up trapped in Iraq because their trip to visit family coincided with the start of the Gulf War.\n\nBefore her injury, she confesses, she never gave much thought about including people with disabilities in conversations about diversity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed in myself that it took this for that shift to happen,\u201d she says. Now, she says, when she looks at a script, she asks, \u201cWhere is the disability community?\u201d in the same way that she has long considered, \u201cWhere are the racial minorities?\u201d and \u201cWhere is the gender diversity?\u201d\n\nThis summer, she participated in a program created by a Maryland-based organization, RespectAbility, that aims to increase the presence of people with disabilities in the entertainment industry. The program chose 22 participants who spent five weeks in Los Angeles meeting at major Hollywood studios.\n\nLauren Appelbaum, vice president of communications for the organization, says the participants all had involvement in the field and different personal experiences, which included deafness, blindness, spinal-cord injuries and mental-health diagnoses. Increasing the visibility of people with disabilities behind the camera is important, she explains, because it makes it more likely that realistic reflections of them will make it onto screens.\n\nHow people view and talk about disabilities needs to change, she says.\n\n[This Georgetown sophomore wants to change how we view and talk about disabilities]\n\n\u201cSometimes I do these trainings and people will self-identify for the first time in front of their colleagues,\u201d she says. During the summer program, one of the participants told her he forgot to take his medication and explained what might happen as a result. She says he told her, \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to tell a supervisor that before.\u201d\n\nIt has been a year since Nasreen wanted to keep her story exclusively among friends and relatives, and she now speaks openly about how her injury shaped her story and the ones she wants to tell. A few months ago, she sat on a panel in front of entertainment leaders and told them, \u201cEveryone here, including me, has privilege in some way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is: What are you doing with that privilege?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a question I ask myself every time I\u2019m sculpting a story.\u201d\n\nShe just finished working on a film featuring a lead character who is blind, gay and Jewish.\n\n\u201cAnd the story is not about his blindness,\u201d Nasreen says. It is also not about him being gay or Jewish. \u201cIt\u2019s about something that is much more accessible to people, which is his first crush.\u201d", "description": "Nasreen Alkhateeb didn\u2019t give much thought to how disabilities are portrayed on screen \u2014 until she was clinging to the hood of a car and her foot hit the pavement.", "authors": ["Theresa Vargas", "Local Columnist Who Previously Wrote For The Local Enterprise Team About Poverty", "Race", "People With Disabilities.", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VM9JAS5RC_jOaJz8qgJ69SB5yPs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JIXIDJWVUMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
