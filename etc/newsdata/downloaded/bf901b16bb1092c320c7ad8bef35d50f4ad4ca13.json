He was 69.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Reuters Deputy Editor-in-Chief Paul Ingrassia speaks during a meeting with staff members at the Thomson Reuters Corp head office in New York, April 19, 2011. REUTERS/Gary Hershorn\n\nHe died at a hospital near his home in Naples, Florida, his brother Larry Ingrassia said.\n\nIngrassia served as Reuters managing editor for five years ending in 2016 after completing a 31-year career as a reporter, editor and executive at the Wall Street Journal and its parent company Dow Jones.\n\nReuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said: \u201cPaul Ingrassia was a devoted, charming and utterly decent man who refused to let illness deflect him from his passions or deny us the immeasurable gift of his brilliance, humanity and love.\u201d\n\nIngrassia shared the Pulitzer Prize for beat reporting with his Journal colleague Joseph B. White in 1993 for their often exclusive coverage of management turmoil at General Motors.\n\nWhite, now Reuters global automotive industry editor, said that in 1992 GM issued a press release announcing a leadership shake-up after a series of deep quarterly losses.\n\n\u201cPaul saw immediately that there was a bigger story: That GM\u2019s board of directors had rebelled, and were asserting control over the company after years of allowing the company\u2019s CEOs to have their way. He and I began contacting sources, not just those on the winning side but those who had lost as well.\n\n\u201cPaul had cultivated relationships across the spectrum of GM\u2019s fractious executive and middle management ranks, and people trusted that he would present their views fairly,\u201d White said.\n\nBorn in Laurel, Mississippi, Ingrassia survived multiple forms of cancer. In accepting the Gerald Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016, he deadpanned: \u201cI often think that my biggest lifetime achievement is simply having a lifetime.\u201d\n\nLarry Ingrassia, also a journalist, said he followed his older brother to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While Larry always thought of himself as a generalist, he said, \u201cPaul was into cars. Once he got to Detroit, that was it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe loved the fact that it was an industry that had larger-than-life characters ... He loved the idea that it encompassed everything about business and beyond: design and engineering and labour relations and great rivalries among the companies, and environmental issues and international trade issues. It was all those things that kind of really fascinated him,\u201d the brother said.\n\nIngrassia wrote three books about the good and bad times of the auto industry.\n\nIn 1994 he co-wrote with White \u201cComeback: The Fall and Rise of the American Automobile Industry.\u201d In 2010 he wrote \u201cCrash Course: The American Automobile Industry\u2019s Road from Glory to Disaster\u201d and in 2012 \u201cEngines of Change: A History of the American Dream in Fifteen Cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe called it as he saw it, he was thorough, fair, accurate, smart. He was in the business so long, he knew it. There was nothing he didn\u2019t know about obscure people in the industry, or historical things,\u201d Larry Ingrassia said.\n\nImpish humour\n\nWhen he died Paul Ingrassia had been serving as an editor and writer at the Revs Institute, an automotive history and research centre in Naples. A photo on its website shows him smiling on a sunny day while sitting on the hood of a shiny red BMW, the car dressed for Christmas as Rudolph with reindeer antlers and a bright red nose.\n\nAdler recalled thinking when he met Ingrassia that he seemed earnest and strait-laced. \u201cBut he turned out to be nerdily funny, with a super-dry and sometimes corny sense of humour.\u201d\n\nAt times Ingrassia\u2019s impish sense of humour extended to making gentle fun of world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and former British Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nIn 2014 he interviewed Sergio Marchionne, a former chief executive of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV who died last year. After their onstage interview at the Brookings Institution in Washington, Ingrassia told Marchionne he was bound for Moscow to interview Putin.\n\n\u201cThis means I\u2019ll be interviewing two dictators in one week,\u201d Ingrassia added.\n\nIn an \u201cOde to Brexit\u201d penned in February for the journalism website Tortoise, Ingrassia wrote:\n\n\u201cThe ruling class was roundly stunned,\n\nHow could this be? What have they done?\n\nCameron said, \u2018I\u2019m off, away!\u2019\n\nAnd entered then Theresa May.\n\nShe\u2019s earnest and hardworking, too,\n\nAlas, she also had no clue.\u201d\n\nIngrassia leaves his wife Susie and two adult sons. Another son, Charlie, died of cancer at 39 this year.\n\nNew York Times columnist Bret Stephens, a friend of Ingrassia\u2019s, said: \u201cHe was like my idea of what a great journalist is, completely self-effacing, incredibly and quietly knowledgeable, thoughtful in every way that counts - but above all as a human being and a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was wise and courageous like few other human beings I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of knowing,\u201d Stephens said.", "description": "Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Ingrassia, a former managing editor of Reuters News who chronicled the ups and downs of the auto industry for more than 30 years, died on Monday after being treated for pancreatic cancer.
