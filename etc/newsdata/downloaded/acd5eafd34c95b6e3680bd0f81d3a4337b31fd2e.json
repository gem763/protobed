Mandatory Credit: Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sports\n\nYankees reliever Dellin Betances, whose Achilles tendon injury on Sunday finished him for 2019, at least has reason to believe he won\u2019t need surgery to repair the partial tear.\n\nBetances, who was making his season debut in Toronto when he injured himself jumping on the mound after striking out the Blue Jays\u2019 Brandon Drury, spent the first five months recovering from shoulder and lat issues. He threw eight pitches \u2014 seven were strikes \u2014 in the fourth inning on Sunday.\n\nA second opinion on Betances\u2019 injury matched the first opinion, Yankees manager Aaron Boone told the media on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be in a walking boot for another four weeks, and then they\u2019ll kind of re-evaluate where he is, but the belief is that he will not need surgery,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI guess that could possibly change, but they feel pretty confident that this is something that will not need surgery.\u201d\n\nBetances, 31, is 21-22 with a 2.36 ERA over 358 career appearances (one start) with the Yankees in seven previous seasons. He was 4-6 with 2.70 ERA in 66 relief appearances for New York last season. He was an All-Star from 2014 through 2017.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Yankees reliever Dellin Betances, whose Achilles tendon injury on Sunday finished him for 2019, at least has reason to believe he won't need surgery to repair the partial tear.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431851137&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J08I-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
