Their own dramas and emotional swings are totally normal, but adults? Asking them to follow the rules? Or just make a phone call at the appointed date and time? Unreasonable! Embarrassing! GOD.\n\nThe thing is, as the Colonel says, I\u2019ve done some back-of-the-napkin calculations in my head, and I\u2019ve been able to determine they\u2019re full of shit. The adults in this show are uniformly good eggs. The worst thing anyone can say about the Eagle is that he is doggedly, dorkily competent in enforcing school rules against illicit behavior. Pudge\u2019s parents are gigantic squares who plainly adore him. Dr. Hyde walks the philosophical walk, always trying to see his students as they truly are, rather than how he might wish they would be. How\u2019s anyone supposed to formulate sick burns based on these decent people doing their jobs well? \u201cOooooh, you establish healthy boundaries! And enforce them daily!!!\u201d isn\u2019t going to devastate anyone. It\u2019s just \u2026 a description of a best-case scenario. Still, even when adults are demonstrably loving and wise, teens gonna teen, because that\u2019s what\u2019s developmentally appropriate for them to do. That\u2019s pretty much the thesis of this episode, which is the best of the miniseries so far.\n\nFirst up in the Teens Gonna Teen category is Pudge. After some very on-brand dithering about staying on campus for Thanksgiving to keep Alaska company over the long weekend, Pudge decides to stick around, even though the Colonel and Takumi try to razz him out of it by describing exactly what will happen: \u201cYou THINK something amazing\u2019s gonna happen, and she\u2019s gonna break up with Jake and you\u2019re gonna experience sexual fireworks, but really you\u2019re just going to drink shitty wine and melt candles.\u201d\n\nA very cute conversation with his parents (Cranberry sauce! Road trip! The Halters can\u2019t wait to see their boy!) leaves Pudge thinking he\u2019ll come home after all, but an unexpected heart-to-heart with Alaska\u2019s profoundly decent, erstwhile boyfriend, Jake, shows him that an opportunity to win Alaska\u2019s heart may exist, and there\u2019s no way he\u2019s turning it down. Again: super on-brand for Pudge.\n\nNext up: the Colonel and Takumi. As they leave campus for the weekend, they roast Pudge for his rat-adjacent choice to stay, with comments set to varying degrees of withering. When the Colonel\u2019s mother, Dolores, learns of the rift between her son and his friends, she tries to set him straight by insisting they drive back to Culver Creek on Thanksgiving morning to bring Pudge and Alaska to their home for the holiday. Dolores, played with heart and verve by Deneen Tyler, is enormously winning. It\u2019s easy to see where the Colonel gets both his talent for flights of verbal derring-do and his dedication to a moral code. I\u2019d have been happy just to spend the full episode peeking over Dolores\u2019s shoulder to learn her recipe for sweet-potato pie.\n\nOnce campus empties out, Pudge goes along with Alaska\u2019s Thanksgiving traditions of burying wine and drinking it in the woods and doing \u2026 candle? Stuff? With fewer friends around to compete for Alaska\u2019s attention, Pudge takes a more active role in their conversations, asking why she hasn\u2019t been returning Jake\u2019s calls, pushing back on her third-wave feminist, Holly Golightly\u2013style answers. Without someone asking her to hit the verbal pause button, Alaska barely draws breath between flights of rhetorical fancy, bouncing from a hypothesis that the creek behind school will take them to Miss Ann\u2019s Diner in town, to reading aloud from Cat\u2019s Cradle and sharing that she fucking loves Vonnegut, to quoting and quizzing Pudge on Auden, to announcing that it\u2019s time to raid their classmates\u2019 rooms for their secret stashes of booze and porn.\n\nAs they stroll tipsily through the woods, sharing a bottle of their previously buried wine, who do they come across but Dr. Hyde, out for a walk with his dog! Pudge tries to hide the wine behind his back but the good doctor\u2019s facial expression fairly hollers \u201coh, son, don\u2019t even try.\u201d Back at Dr. Hyde\u2019s house \u2014 a dream of lived-in midcentury home furnishings and tasteful cultural abundance \u2014 he declines to punish them or involve the Eagle, who he describes as \u201can admirable educator, strapped with the thankless task of protecting 200 self-involved teenagers.\u201d A little on the nose? Sure. 100,000 percent correct? Yes, indeed.\n\nInstead, Hyde serves the kids apple juice in fancy cut-glass tumblers while he sips a not-so-wee dram of the Macallan and shares some of his life\u2019s impressive highlight reel. Alaska very nosily noses around Dr. Hyde\u2019s romantic history, insisting he must have been in love at least once, and he acknowledges having had one great love: Diego, the handsome guy in the photo on the mantelpiece. When Diego died of AIDS, the experience prompted Dr. Hyde to relinquish his career as a political scientist and take up religious studies. I defy anyone watching not to well all the way up as Ron Cephas Jones quotes St. Augustine\u2019s lament that \u201cI poured my soul into the dust by loving a man who was soon to die, as if he would live forever.\u201d Still, he wouldn\u2019t trade a moment of it away, \u201cnot even the suffering.\u201d The resonances between Hyde\u2019s experiences and the grief Pudge, Takumi, and the Colonel are soon to be plunged into are both rich and delicate.\n\nBack on the quad, Alaska declares Hyde brave but suffering, and then posits that Bolivar\u2019s labyrinth is actually just the suffering we experience when we grapple with loss alone. Pudge can tell Alaska is projecting quite a bit, and when he presses her on it, she claims she\u2019s totally alone, but Pudge points out that she has him, and Hyde, and Jake. She declares there\u2019s no point in trying to explain the depth of her suffering, because he wouldn\u2019t understand, but Pudge insists that he\u2019s fully committed to his friendship with her: \u201cNo matter what you did, I would never walk away from you.\u201d\n\nFollowing an idyllic Thanksgiving dinner with Dolores and the Colonel, Alaska forces Pudge to test that hypothesis. Although Dolores reassures Alaska that her boy will come around, the Colonel tells her that their current d\u00e9tente ends the second they get back to campus. He just can\u2019t believe that their solidarity, based in being poor kids from messed-up families, can withstand the temptation to rat if the need arises. Worse still, he believes Alaska has got to cut Pudge loose so that he has a chance to survive socially at Culver Creek.\n\nIn order for this gambit to work, Alaska has to be cruelly efficient in extinguishing all of Pudge\u2019s hopes, and unfortunately, he tees it right up by trying to kiss her after she flops dramatically and non-smoochily onto the bed. She shoves him off the bed and and across the room, spitting out an accusation that he thinks that \u201cfucking me will make me feel better.\u201d It\u2019s bleakly funny since we\u2019ve seen Alaska self-medicate with sex, but there\u2019s a heartbreaking grain of truth in there, too.\n\nDolores isn\u2019t done working on the Colonel, telling him he needs to find a way to forgive Alaska, because what she needs more than anything right now is a good friend: \u201cThat girl is lonelier than you know.\u201d The teens\u2019 faces as they walk back to campus telegraph what\u2019s to come. Alaska has donned a mask of neutrality, Pudge looks stricken, and the Colonel is both grimly determined and a little bit shaken by his mom\u2019s righteous upbraiding. We\u2019ve now seen three competent, loving adults give our protagonists good advice about living with grief and human complexities. All we can do is wait. We\u2019re at 21 days before.\n\nFamous Last Words\n\n\u2022 Best Musical Cue of the episode: I sure did laugh when the chunky opening bass riff of Jet\u2019s \u201cAre You Gonna Be My Girl?\u201d rang out over Pudge\u2019s hopeful walk to Alaska\u2019s room following his conversation with Jake. But that\u2019s a joke that only works one time. \u201cLovely Day\u201d by Bill Withers takes the prize this episode for providing a perfect character and relationship development moment that\u2019s worth rewatching.\n\n\u2022 Can we take a moment to praise the set designers? Both Dr. Hyde\u2019s house and Dolores\u2019s trailer do exactly what sets should do, reinforcing our perception that people live there and made very specific choices about their furniture and knick-knacks. Of course Dolores\u2019 room is a shrine to the Colonel\u2019s accomplishments.\n\n\u2022 Takumi\u2019s silky floral bomber in the Thanksgiving departure scene: Where can I acquire one?
