It was followed less than five months later by another deadly 737 Max crash in Ethiopia.\n\nRead more: Slowdown fears, trade wars hit sales at major industrial companies\n\nBoeing is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Wednesday before the bell, with the latest about the 737 Max and its anticipated return to the skies firmly in focus.\n\nThe Max planes have been grounded world-wide since March, and their return-to-service date remains uncertain, pushed back from summer to fall and now possibly into early 2020.\n\nSee also: Air Canada removes 737 Max planes from its schedule until Feb. 14\n\nBoeing is still working on a solution for an equipment malfunction that appears to connect the two doomed 737 Max flights, and the fallout from the problems before and after the plane\u2019s certification continue.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report on Friday, the FAA is concerned it was misled by Boeing about a key safety feature on the 737 Max, the latest news casting doubt about the certification process.\n\nBoeing earlier this week moved to strip Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg of his board chairmanship, only hours after air-safety experts criticized the company and the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s role in the two crashes.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect:\n\nEarnings: Of 23 analysts polled by FactSet, Boeing is expected to report adjusted earnings of $2.04 a share for the third quarter. That would compare with an adjusted profit of $3.58 a share in the third quarter of 2018. In the second quarter, Boeing reported an adjusted loss of $5.82 a share.\n\nEstimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as buy-side analysts, fund managers, company executives, academics and others, is expecting an adjusted profit of $2.15 a share for Boeing.\n\nRevenue: The analysts surveyed by FactSet expect sales of $19.50 billion for Boeing. That would be down from $25.15 billion a year ago. Estimize sees revenue of $19.80 billion for Boeing.\n\nStock movement: Boeing shares have gained about 13% this year, and are up 1.3% in the past 12 months. That compares with gains of 15% and 6% in the last 12 months for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Boeing is a Dow component.\n\nThe analysts surveyed by FactSet on average rate Boeing stock a buy with a price target of $428.10, an upside around 18%.\n\nWhat else to expect: Boeing issues are not limited to the 737 Max.\n\nBoeing earlier this month reported third-quarter deliveries that were \u201clight \u201c on deliveries of the wide-body 787 Dreamliner, which led analysts at Goldman Sachs to conjecture that Boeing could be reallocating resources to the 737 Max and impacting the 787 delivery schedule.\n\nIn the note, the Goldman analysts also lowered their third-quarter profit expectations for Boeing to $2.24 a share, from a previous estimate of $2.51 a share, keeping their price target at $370 a share.\n\nIn addition, concerns about Boeing\u2019s next plane, the 777X, passenger traffic, its defense and space business, and the overall health of its commercial cycle have increased, Ken Herbert at Canaccord said in a note this week.\n\nBoeing booked a charge in the second quarter related to the Max problems, but that may not be enough, the analysts said.\n\n\u201cWe believe there is risk that Boeing will take an additional charge on the 737 Max as the \u2018early\u2019 (fourth quarter return-to-service) has slipped to the right, although we would expect there was some buffer in the (second quarter of 2019) charge,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nCanaccord kept its hold rating on the stock with a $380 price target, and also trimmed third-quarter profit estimates, to $2.05 a share.\n\nRelated: Caterpillar earnings: Expect weakness on China tensions and global economic slowdown\n\nExpectations \u201care low for the quarter and much of the sentiment on the results will revolve around MAX commentary and expectations,\u201d Herbert said. With the Max still grounded, Boeing is unlikely to reinstate guidance for the year.\n\nFurther clouding the prospects for the plane maker, risk around potential tariffs and implications of the ongoing trade wars \u201care material,\u201d adding \u201crisk at the wrong time,\u201d he said.", "description": "Nearly a year after the deadly Lion Air Flight 610 crash, Boeing Co. faces an on-year 40% decline in profit and 22% drop in revenue for its third quarter....", "authors": ["Claudia Assis"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT630_boeing_ZG_20191018131312.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
