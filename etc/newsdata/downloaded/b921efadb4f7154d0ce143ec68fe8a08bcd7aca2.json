France is phasing it out by 2023.\n\nVietnam banned all herbicides containing glyphosate soon after the Roundup cases in the US, but the decision was swiftly denounced by the US Secretary of Agriculture, who said it would impact global agricultural production.\n\nThailand\u2019s health minister, who has argued the pesticides put lives at risk, praised Tuesday\u2019s move as \u201cheroic\u201d on his Facebook page even as several dozen farmers protested \u2014 citing a rise in production costs.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have the chemicals to eradicate the weeds, we will have to use more labourers,\u201d said Charat Narunchron of a farmers association in Chanthaburi province, who called the ban \u201cunfair\u201d.\n\nThailand\u2019s Pesticide Alert Network \u2014 which has long advocated for the ban \u2014 thanked the government but said it needs to help farmers adjust to other methods.", "description": "Bangkok (AFP) \u2013 Thailand edged closer Tuesday to banning glyphosate and two other controversial pesticides despite protests from farmers in a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/ec9953_containers-pesticide-weed-killer-containing-paraquat-glyphosate-on-sale-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
