A lot of people talk about it and it's easy to sit here and say we want to be brutal, but you have to back those words up.\"\n\nVunipola, who is expected to start alongside his brother, prop Mako, has his own individual contest to take care of. He has come up against South Africa No. 8 Duane Vermeulen on three occasions in test rugby and lost every time.\n\nThat head-to-head record is in his mind this week.\n\n\"He's such a big player for them,\" Vunipola said. \"I played against him last summer and he was monumental in terms of getting them those two victories (in a series the Springboks won 2-1). Not just myself, but we've got to try and negate the influence of him and everyone else around him.\"\n\nMitchell said he didn't expect any of England's potential injury concerns \u2014 Jonny May (hamstring), Owen Farrell, and Sinckler (tight calf muscle) \u2014 to be ruled out of Saturday's match.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
