First against Albania on Friday and then again against France on Monday night.\n\nThe salute was immediately adopted by supporters frantically waving Turkish flags in the Stade de France on Monday night.\n\nTheir action was in tribute to Turkey's military operation in Northern Syria and \"a symbol of defiance\" amid international condemnation of Turkey's operation.\n\nFootball in Turkey has always been instrumental in galvanising national sentiment when played in international leagues but even more so when fuelled by anti-Western feeling.\n\nThe spirit of \"conquest\" soon followed on social media.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Turkish-backed forces enter the border town of Tel Abyad\n\n\"Get to know us, France. While you condemn us, we give you a military salute in your own land. Long live Turkey, we are making history,\" proclaimed one Twitter user, while many others added the hashtag \"#ConquestofEurope\" (AvrupaninFethi).\n\nAnother declared: \"A quick reminder to Western media and Uefa who consider a military salute as a political or a racist message: This is not a political message but a way of expressing respect for the soldiers of this Republic which has been built over its soldiers' blood.\"\n\nWhy Turks are backing their army\n\nThe mood in Turkey's border town of Akcakale is no different. \"We are ready to go to the frontline and fight,\" flag-waving residents told BBC Turkish. \"We are waiting for our President Erdogan's order.\"\n\nTurkey have been fighting the Kurdish militant PKK in Turkey for over three decades and those backing Turkey's military intervention in northern Syria see this move as an extended fight.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Most Turks see the operation in northern Syria as an extension of the campaign against Kurdish militants in Turkey\n\nThe manifestation of support for Turkey's military reflects the general nationalist mood in Turkey and is heard much louder than criticism.\n\nMainly because those who dare to disagree with the national discourse of the military operation face criminal charges.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict\n\nLegal action has been taken against nearly 80 social media users who criticised the operation. They are accused of \"inciting hatred and engaging in terror propaganda\".\n\nMany Twitter accounts belonging to Kurdish activists and journalists are blocked in Turkey.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main instrument in driving his power to shape public opinion has largely been through the media, which he is accused of using as a propaganda machine.\n\nMainstream media outlets are largely owned by Mr Erdogan's associate conglomerates.\n\nAnd there is little surprise that opposition voices are also muted in the mainstream media, which now stand largely as a pro-government mouthpiece.\n\nWell-known Turkish TV presenters flocked to the border in military gear narrating the intervention in a heroic and lyric mood.\n\nA strong nationalist narrative is also embraced by the press. They hardly give space to criticism, and when they do they tend to criticise it.\n\nBritish Labour Party MP David Lammy was not spared.\n\nMr Lammy criticised the Turkish operation with footage of a dead child: \"The human face of Trump decision to give Turkey a free pass to attack Kurdish allies in north-eastern Syria. Heartbreaking.\"\n\nPro-government CNNTurk channel accused him of spreading \"black propaganda\" about Turkey's military intervention, tweeting the piece with a darkened image of the MP that many believed was a racial reference.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @DavidLammy Why have @cnnturk darkened my image in this picture to accuse me of spreading propaganda? I am raising important issues about Trump's decision to abandon the Kurds to Erdogan\u2019s forces in north eastern Syria. pic.twitter.com/k2907GqCck \u2014 David Lammy (@DavidLammy) October 13, 2019 Report\n\nWhat Turkey's Kurds think\n\nTurkey's official line in this operation is to clear the border of the Syrian Democratic Forces, who are largely made of Syrian Kurdish fighters, along with Arab and Christian fighters.\n\nKurds in Turkey make up to around 20% of the country's population. Their voice is nowhere to be heard either.\n\nResidents of the Kurdish-dominated town of Diyarbakir have mainly chosen to remain silent in fear of legal action against them.\n\nThat goes for a spice shop owner in Diyarbakir's busiest bazaar who told BBC Turkish: \"Everybody is aggrieved, but we repress our feelings. When you have too many police in plainclothes around, nobody would talk to you.\"\n\nThe political parties are largely following the ruling AK party's government line: the secular CHP, nationalist Good Party and the nationalist MHP all back the military operation.\n\nThere is just one exception in the opposition: the pro-Kurdish HDP party. Their leadership is behind bars, and their members face legal charges, intimidation and constant online abuse.\n\nPockets of HDP members trying to hold rallies against the military intervention in the south-eastern part of Turkey have either been detained or forced to leave by the police.\n\nPolice raided several municipalities in the mostly Kurdish-populated towns of Hakkari, Mardin and Van on Tuesday, detaining a number of Kurdish administrators, including co-mayors.\n\nWith voices opposing the military operation muted and intimidated, nationalist sentiment is all that remains, mainly driven by pro-government media.", "description": "Footballers and politicians join in praising their army's incursion into northern Syria.", "authors": ["Cagil Kasapoglu", "Bbc Turkish"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/32AE/production/_109247921_7ffa00ff-0946-47bc-b3d6-f6b23eb27812.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
