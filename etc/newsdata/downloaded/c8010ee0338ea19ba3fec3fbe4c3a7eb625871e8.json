(refrain) from the arbitrary detention of Uighurs and members of other Muslim communities,\" it said.\n\nCountries backing it included the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Japan and New Zealand.\n\nBut that statement was swiftly countered by the one from Belarus -- where China is building a massive industrial park -- which praised Beijing's rights record.\n\n\"We commend China's remarkable achievements in the field of human rights by adhering to the people-centered development philosophy and protecting and promoting human rights through development,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We also appreciate China's contributions to the international human rights cause,\" it added, while criticizing the \"politicization\" of the issue of human rights at the UN.\n\nUighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, make up largest portion of the population of Xinjiang, a vast region in northwestern China.", "description": "China's mass detention and surveillance of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang province came under fire at the United Nations Tuesday, with 23 nations -- mostly...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/08/wire-20364418-1572423797-126_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
