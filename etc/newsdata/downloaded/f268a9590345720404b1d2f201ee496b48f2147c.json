Walmart and Eko experimented with an initial version of a Toy Lab that generated 8 million interactions, Eko said. Visitors spent an average of 13 minutes and had 13 interactions per visit, the company said. Twelve percent of users also added a toy to their wish lists, the company said.\n\nEko also operates a free platform with interactive videos from BuzzFeed, Refinery29 and others.\n\nInteractive video can be a tough sell for marketers who are unsure if there is a big enough audience for this type of programming.\n\nEko\u2019s own video platform has a monthly active user base in the \u201csingle-digit millions,\u201d according to Ivy Sheibar, chief business officer at Eko. \u201cWhen you have meaningful choice on platforms with superior tech, you will see the engagement, the completion rates, the click-through rates that get people to sit up and take notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing here is a real hole left by Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us leaving the ecosystem,\u201d Ms. Sheibar said of KidHQ. \u201cWe\u2019re giving kids and parents a place to experience toys, while giving parents the ability to understand what their kids are interested in\u2014but doing it in a way that can be fun for both.\u201d\n\nMarketers receive aggregated, anonymized data on purchases through KidHQ and how visitors interact with different toys, Ms. Sheibar said.\n\nEko is in conversations about adding other toy manufacturers, children\u2019s entertainment programmers and food marketers to KidHQ, she added.\n\nThe minimum commitment for a \u201cfloor\u201d in the new KidHQ is seven figures, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe KidHQ videos for Mattel and Walmart were produced by BuzzFeed as part of a larger content deal between Eko and the publisher. BuzzFeed will also promote KidHQ across its media properties including Playful and Tasty, as well as on the BuzzFeed-affiliated retail store Camp, said Ben Kaufman, BuzzFeed\u2019s marketing chief.\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at sahil.patel@wsj.com", "description": "Mattel and Walmart are trying out interactive video to market and sell toys through a new virtual store called KidHQ.", "authors": ["Sahil Patel", "Sahil.Patel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-117569/social", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
