Workers at Bradford's libraries and museums also voted to go on strike over what a union called \"swingeing cuts\".\n\nElsewhere, Essex County Council reversed a decision to close 25 of 74 libraries in July but said it wanted volunteers to run some smaller branches, while in August the High Court ruled Northamptonshire County Council's plan to close 21 of its 36 libraries was unlawful.\n\nThe funding will \"make a massive difference\", Museums Association Sharon Heal said. \"Our members have told us about crumbling ceilings, leaking roofs and a lack of money to be able to carry out basic maintenance work.\n\n\"Often museums are housed in historic properties that have suffered from years of neglect and in order to protect our fantastic collections and ensure that our communities can continue to enjoy them we need to act now - this funding will enable museums and galleries in England to do just that.\"\n\nThe \u00a3250m will be delivered by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) along with Arts Council England, the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Historic England.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
