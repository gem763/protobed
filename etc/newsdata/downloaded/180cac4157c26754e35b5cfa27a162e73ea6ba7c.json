If you get 50, you feel bad because you should have got a hundred. Even if you get a hundred, you feel you should have got 150. So you\u2019re always failing.\u201d\n\nCook had worried about bagging a pair in his last Test but he made 71 in the first innings. Then, driven by the determination that means only Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis and Rahul Dravid scored more runs than he did in his 161 Tests, Cook hit a magical 147 in the second innings.\n\nJoe Root says losing hurts but he wants to carry on as England captain Read more\n\nHis new autobiography still carries an opening line in which Cook apologises to his teammates for getting out in that game against India at the Oval. He was only 33, and fitter than ever, but Test cricket had drained him and sealed his international retirement.\n\nEngland, who failed to win back the Ashes when they lost to Australia at Old Trafford on Sunday, have missed Cook terribly. His tenacity and the sheer weight of his runs would have tempered the domination of Steve Smith. But Cook has been refreshed, while playing county cricket for Essex, and produced a fascinating and layered book that delves into the psychological challenges of the game.\n\nThe fact that I went out on my own terms, with an ending like that, made it so special. You can't buy that sort of stuff\n\nWritten with the consistently excellent Michael Calvin, Cook\u2019s autobiography is a timely read at the end of an exhilarating yet flawed summer for English cricket. From an incredible World Cup final to a gripping Ashes series where his former teammates have veered from the heroic to the shambolic, Cook has been absorbed.\n\nYet it seems right to start with Tuesday\u2019s anniversary of his final innings. He and Calvin have written an evocative first chapter about that blissful day, even if much of the book covers darker terrain, and Cook says: \u201cOne day I\u2019ll watch it ball by ball. On the highlights you look quite a good player \u2013 but I played and missed five times in a row against Mohammed Shami. When I finally hit one I had a massive smile.\u201d\n\nCook grins again. \u201cMost people get the terrible phone call saying you\u2019re dropped, and never playing again, which takes a long time to get over. The fact that I went out on my own terms, with an ending like that, made it so special. I had 30 of my friends in the box when I got that hundred. You can\u2019t buy that sort of stuff.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cook salutes the Oval crowd after his final Test innings, the fairytale 147 against India a year ago. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nEngland can\u2019t buy another opening batsman like Cook. They are being made to pay for neglecting the basics of Test cricket while prioritising the World Cup. \u201cThe country is going through one of those little periods where they\u2019re a bit short,\u201d he says of the dearth of opening batsmen. But Cook concedes that, once Andrew Strauss retired in 2012, none of his 14 subsequent partners lasted. That \u201clittle period\u201d stretches across seven years.\n\n\u201cSam Robson was interesting,\u201d Cook says as he picks out one of the 14. \u201cHe did OK, and scored a hundred in his second game, but kept on getting out the same way. In Test cricket there are few hiding places and you\u2019re not used to the scrutiny.\u201d\n\nPreparing for what proved his final Test innings, in 2014, Robson seemed transfixed as he watched a montage of his previous dismissals on television. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault,\u201d Cook says. \u201cThe TV was on, we\u2019re waiting to bat and he saw himself get out again and again. Unfortunately he was out the same way and hasn\u2019t played since. It would be interesting to ask Sam what he remembers of his Test career [with an average of 30.54 after seven caps] and how he would change it. Sam felt the difference between county and Test cricket and those are the players the ECB should speak to so we can help educate the next guys.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always had Lara, Ponting and Kallis as the three best batsmen I\u2019ve ever seen. Smith is younger than me but what he\u2019s achieving is phenomenal.\n\nHas Cook spotted any county batsmen who could emerge as significant Test players? \u201cI\u2019ve seen some good players but not an obvious one where you go: \u2018Ohh!\u2019 Harry Brook at Yorkshire looks a serious talent \u2013 particularly against spin. [Rob] Yates at Warwickshire is definitely in my mould and grinds it out. He\u2019s very organised.\u201d\n\nBrook is 20 and Yates only 19 and so it will take time for England to develop new batsmen. Rory Burns and Joe Denly, who batted doggedly on Sunday, will open for the second successive match when the fifth Test begins on Thursday.\n\nSmith has been the overwhelming difference between the teams, as his Ashes scores have been 144, 142, 92, 211 and 82. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s one of the best ever,\u201d Cook says wryly of Smith\u2019s style, \u201cbut he\u2019s operating on a different level. I\u2019ve always had Lara, Ponting and Kallis as the three best batsmen I\u2019ve ever seen. Smith [30] is younger than me but what he\u2019s achieving is phenomenal. He\u2019s redefining what is possible as a batsman. The MCC manual talks about side-on movement but Smith stands in a much more open way and still plays incredibly well.\n\n\u201cHe is a freak in terms of his ability to play the kind of unorthodox shot, on all-fours, he used to get to his 50 on the first day [last week]. His God-given talent, apart from his work ethic and hand-eye co-ordination, is extraordinary. He nicks the ball far less than any other player ever \u2013 maybe with the exception of Don Bradman. Smith just doesn\u2019t miss a ball on his pads.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Smith hits another boundary at Old Trafford. \u2018He\u2019s operating on a different level\u2019 says Cook. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nIn his book, Cook returns to the 2017-18 Ashes, which Australia won, when he and England\u2019s players shared a few beers with Smith\u2019s team. Cook remembers that \u201cDavid Warner, a couple of beers into his celebration, mentioned that he used substances attached to the strapping on his hand to accelerate the deterioration of the ball during a first-class match. I looked at Steve Smith who shot a glance that said: \u2018Ooh, you shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d\n\nDid the Australians use sandpaper to tamper with the ball before they were caught doing so in Cape Town in March 2018? \u201cStuart Broad sums it up pretty well and says they got the ball to reverse swing in that Ashes. Why change what you\u2019ve been doing? Why suddenly use sandpaper? People know what was going on. But it\u2019s been the best thing for Australian cricket because they realised it wasn\u2019t acceptable. The win-at-all-costs culture they created isn\u2019t what the Australian public needed or wanted. They\u2019d gone too far.\u201d\n\nAustralia have retained the Ashes but, at Headingley, Ben Stokes hit a monumental 135 not out as England passed a target of 358 \u2013 after being bowled out for 67 in the first innings. Cook describes Stokes as one of the cricketers to whom he is closest. He also says Stokes is the best team player he has known in putting his desire for England\u2019s success above personal milestones.\n\nI think the Bristol case made Ben realise that not many people can bat, bowl and field like he can \u2013 and he had to make the most of his talents\n\n\u201cCricket is such a stats-based game for each player but no one knows Tiger Woods\u2019s average round. They just know Woods has won 15 majors. As cricketers we\u2019re judged on the average we have from being a 21-year-old who\u2019s just come into international cricket to the day you retire. What should matter is the impact you have on games. Stokesy will always have an average around 35, and 30 with the ball, but that\u2019s misleading. He wins massive games of cricket.\u201d\n\nCook believes that Stokes has been transformed by the assault charges brought against him in a Bristol court after a violent altercation in 2017. He was cleared eventually and Stokes has been making up for it ever since. \u201cBristol had a major impact on him because he realised what he could have lost. I feel I\u2019ve said a couple of things to him at certain times, or had his back on certain things, that have helped him.\n\n\u201cWhen he came in under my captaincy he was rough around the edges. But in his second Test he played an unbelievable innings in Perth when there was such a crack in the pitch. I\u2019m mentally fairly decent but it was unnerving and I went first ball. Ben batted incredibly [scoring 120]. The fact he played like that, at 22, makes him the maverick he is. I did guide [Stokes] a little and had that affinity with him. But the last thing I want is to take any credit for what he\u2019s done. I think the Bristol case made him realise that not many people can bat, bowl and field like he can \u2013 and he had to make the most of his talents.\u201d\n\nCook was in the commentary box, on Test Match Special, when Stokes and Jack Leach put on 76 for the last wicket to seal that Headingley victory. \u201cI was actually on air,\u201d Cook says of the moment Stokes hit the winning four. \u201cThere are some great clips on the internet of me and Glenn McGrath. I didn\u2019t realise it but Glenn threw down his headset \u2013 I wish I\u2019d seen that. But you\u2019re engrossed in the game, living and breathing it.\u201d\n\nHe is still so close to the England team that, after the match, he joined them in the dressing room. \u201cI was very conscious not to overstay my welcome. But I wanted to see Ben and congratulate him personally. I know life moves on and you are replaceable but I was lucky enough to have a beer with the guys.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cook has been working in a media role but is still close to the England team and his successor as England captain, Joe Root. Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images via Reuters\n\nWas there bedlam in the dressing room? \u201cIt was more shock. Normally with a Test win the music\u2019s blaring but we watched the highlights round the tiniest screen. Everyone was like: \u2018Oh my God, what\u2019s just happened?\u2019\u201d\n\nNeither Australia nor England are great teams, despite the presence of Smith, Stokes and some very fine fast bowlers, but they have produced a riveting series. \u201cTest cricket is changing,\u201d Cook says. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously down to the influence of T20 and the fact that batters now have to master three formats. I had to master one. There are times when the one-day game is so formulaic. Every time you open the batting you\u2019ve got to score at least eight runs an over. In Test cricket that doesn\u2019t happen. There are times you\u2019ve got to suck it up and bat for a draw.\u201d\n\nThe best way of protecting Test cricket is to have less of it. Make it more of a marquee event\n\nHave the Ashes given Cook renewed hope that Test cricket will continue to thrive? \u201c[Last] week we had two Tests. Old Trafford and West Indies against India, who are the biggest powerhouse. They were lucky if they had 25 spectators. Manchester was sold out every day. But that\u2019s not the reality of Test cricket away from England. Something needs to be done.\u201d\n\nWhat is Cook\u2019s solution? \u201cFranchise cricket is here to stay because of the money. But the best way of protecting Test cricket is to have less of it. Make it more of a marquee event. Not a case of: \u2018Oh, we\u2019re playing an Ashes again in 14 months.\u2019 If we play less Test cricket it becomes more special. And then the best players don\u2019t have to choose between franchise and Test cricket.\u201d\n\nEngland find individual heroics are no match for Australia\u2019s potency | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nHow has Cook replaced the intensity of his consuming career? \u201cIt\u2019s more a loss of a goal. All I ever wanted to do was play cricket for England and be successful. Now it\u2019s over, there has been a transition and playing for Essex has helped. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re falling off a cliff. But I haven\u2019t missed Test cricket because I was ready to go. Of course there have been moments I\u2019ve thought: \u2018Oh God, I\u2019ll never do that again.\u2019 But, ultimately, I was very satisfied with my career \u2013 which makes it easier to step away.\u201d\n\nSir Alastair Cook: The Autobiography is out now (Michael Joseph \u00a320)", "description": "The former England captain on Australia\u2019s \u2018freak\u2019 run machine, the psychological battles all cricketers face and why less could be more for the future of Test cricket", "authors": ["Donald Mcrae"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c67588109f6fb291aabf3247875a02910297f2a4/656_499_5303_3182/master/5303.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=891410475b56da1d016dff2b549184c0", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
