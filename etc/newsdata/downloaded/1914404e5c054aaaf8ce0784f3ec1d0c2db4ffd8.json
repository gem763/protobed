[Photo by Zhang Xingjian/chinadaily.com.cn]\n\nThe 2017 Jinshanling Apricot Flower Festival began at Luanping county, Chengde city, North China\u2019s Hebei province, on April 3.\n\nThanks to the amazing natural scenery and rich cultural meanings at the Jinshanling Great Wall, tens of thousands of tourists both at home and abroad travel there to enjoy the spring.\n\n\"It only takes two hours from Beijing to the Jinshanling Great Wall and the traffic is smooth here. Compared with other sections of the Great Wall, Jinshanling is more original and grand, more closer to the ancient Great Wall without modern restoration,\" said a tourist Zhang Hongmin.\n\n\"I thought only the Great Wall would be there but was surprised to see a host of activities, including qipao fashion show, folk art Lunhua show, taking place there, which really impressed me a lot,\" a British tourist Michel Brain added.\n\nChinese comedian Niu Qun hosted the opening ceremony for the flower festival.\n\n\"This is my second visit to the Jinshanling Great Wall at Luanping county. Last time I came, I saw late Blackie Ko, one of the greatest automotive stunt choreographers in Asia, fly across the Great Wall in 1992. After 25 years, I\u2019m back again and ready to appreciate the charm of Jinshanling Great Wall,\" Niu said.\n\nLocated in a mountainous region and about 140 kilometers northeast of Beijing, the Jinshanling Great Wall section is the best preserved part of the Great Wall from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), maintaining several original features.\n\nThe 2017 Jinshanling Apricot Flower Festival, organized by the Chengde Commission of Tourism Development and the Luanping County People's Government, lasts four weeks and more events will be held in the coming days. For example, 1,000 tai chi lovers will perform on the Great Wall, 1,000 soon-to-be spouses will have a special wedding in accordance with Han ethnic group's customs and an international marathon competition will also be held.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201709/15/59bb45f0a310d4d95c4ba124.jpg", "published_at": "2017-04-07"}
