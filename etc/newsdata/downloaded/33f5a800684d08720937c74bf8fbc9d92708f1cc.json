(other XR protesters alongside Morris-Evans are pictured)\n\nMr Bayfield said the protesters left glue residue on the metal panels and glass of the gates, which were old and difficult to replace, hence the high cost.\n\nRepresenting herself, Morris-Evans said: 'There was a company not only continuing to burn fossil fuels but building infrastructure to mine coal, one of the dirtiest fuels out there.\n\n'I wanted to communicate to those attending the AGM that what they were doing was morally untenable.'\n\nMorris-Evans said it was 'morally incumbent' on her to take action against the company.\n\n'At the point of crisis that we are in, the people who are carrying on with this murderous kind of madness to carry on building and extracting fossil fuels are essentially passing a death sentence on many people, not including whole species,' she continued.\n\n'We are playing with fire, quite literally. These people need to understand powerfully that they cannot simply continue what they are doing.\n\n'My intention was to not stand by while something so morally egregious was taking place.'\n\nDitchfield, from Cambridge, told the court she was 'horrified' when she was told about the planned coal mine in north-west Bangladesh which could displace 240,000 people.\n\nShe said she joined the protest to hold the company accountable, telling the judge: 'The only way we could stop them was to stand directly in the way of their actual working procedures that they need to get through to carry on their activities and carry on raising money, which was their AGM.'\n\nEmma Foubister, defending, asked: 'How did you think your actions on December 28 would help those people you described?'\n\nDitchfield replied: 'I wanted to stop their actions, or it would be a step towards stopping the project going through so those people would know they could go on at least with their homes.'\n\nPritchard, of no fixed address, and Ditchfield each had a charge of aggravated trespass dropped.\n\nMorris-Evans, of Brecknock Road, north London, had a charge of trespasser failing to leave land dropped.\n\nDeputy District Judge Paul Booty said the three women were arrested for criminal damage before they were physically able to comply with a police instruction to leave the property, meaning it could not be proved that they intentionally trespassed.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Shulamit Morris-Evans, 23, Angela Ditchfield, 40, and Amy Pritchard, 34, are accused of causing criminal damage by gluing themselves to a central London building where a coal firm held it's AGM.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/15/20038900-0-image-a-28_1571753788904.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
