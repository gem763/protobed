United described the abuse of Pogba as \u201cdisgusting\u201d.\n\nUnited manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Chelsea head coach Frank Lampard have been among those asking for social media companies to do more to address racist behaviour on their platforms.\n\nTwitter says it will \u201ccontinue to take swift action\u201d over the issue, adding it has dealt with \u201cmore than 700 examples of hateful conduct\u201d in the last two weeks.\n\nIt has also met clubs and other football bodies, such as the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association and Kick It Out, in an attempt to \u201ctackle the issue collectively\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis vile content has no place on our service,\u201d the social media giant said in a statement. \u201cWe want to play our part in curbing this unacceptable behaviour.\n\n\u201cIn the past two weeks, we have taken action on more than 700 examples of abuse and hateful conduct related to UK football.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to take swift action on the minority that try to undermine the conversation for the majority. In that same time, we have met with the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, Kick It Out and directly affected football clubs, and agreed a number of proactive measures to tackle this issue collectively.\n\n\u201cWorking with the PFA, we will participate in their player training programme, and will be joining a series of educational sessions with its membership to support the PFA\u2019s ambition to tackle the issue.\n\n\u201cWorking with Kick It Out, we will continue our working relationship with UK policing to further brief them and provide training on our policies, procedures and dedicated 24/7 reporting channels for law enforcement.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, this behaviour does not reflect the vast majority of fans who use Twitter to participate in vibrant conversations around football in the UK. We have spent years forging strong partnerships with clubs, organisations and supporters and deeply value the relationships.\u201d", "description": "Twitter has defended its approach to tackling racism on the platform after several Premier League players were recently subject to racist abuse.
