Still, many high profile Americans died under al-Baghdadi\u2019s reign before U.S. forces were able to kill him.\n\nHere are four Americans who were killed when the ISIS leader was in power.\n\nJames Foley, a Celebrated American Journalist Who Relied on His Catholic Faith\n\nJames Foley was beheaded by the order of al-Baghdadi in 2014, while he worked as a freelance video journalist in northern Syria. Born on October 18, 1973, in Evanston, Illinois, he was the oldest of five children who graduated from Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1996.\n\nHe later got a degree in journalism from Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern and began a career reporting in conflict zones, from Afghanistan to Libya, and then Syria.\n\nIn 2011, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi detained Foley while he was reporting in Libya. During that time, Foley relied on his Catholic faith while in captivity, especially his praying of the rosary.\n\nFoley eventually wrote a letter to Marquette explaining how the university helped him keep the faith using the rosary:\n\nI began to pray the rosary. It was what my mother and grandmother would have prayed. I said 10 Hail Marys between each Our Father. It took a long time, almost an hour to count 100 Hail Marys off on my knuckles. And it helped to keep my mind focused.\n\nAfter Foley was released from captivity 44 days later, he began to travel in and out of northern Syria as a video journalist. He was kidnapped again on November 22, 2012, in northern Syria before ISIS beheaded him on August 19, 2014, in Syria\u2019s Raqqa region.\n\n2. Kayla Mueller, a Humanitarian Who Was Kept Captive by al-Baghdadi\n\nKayla Mueller, of Prescott, Arizona, was doing humanitarian work in Syria when she was kidnapped in 2013. She was travelling with Syrian contractors for Doctors without Borders on the way back to Turkey after installing communications equipment at a hospital when armed ISIS fighters stopped the group.\n\nThe others taken prisoner with Mueller were eventually released, but ISIS thought she was a spy and kept her captive in various locations until her death.\n\nMueller was imprisoned for a time by Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf and his wife Umm Sayyaf. Abu was eventually killed in a 2015 raid, while Umm was captured by FBI officials and charged with imprisoning and torturing Mueller. According to an FBI affidavit, al-Baghdadi personally raped Mueller while she was in the Sayyaf\u2019s custody.\n\nThe Islamic State leader also referred to Mueller as his \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201cwife.\u201d\n\nMueller was killed in the city of Raqqa, the Syrian capital of ISIS, in February 2015.\n\nNational Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press Sunday morning that U.S. forces named the mission to take out al-Baghdadi after Mueller.\n\n3. Steven Sotloff, a Hardcore American Journalist with a \u201cGentle Soul\u201d\n\nSteven Sotloff asked the tough questions until the very end of his life, when he was beheaded by ISIS militants in 2014.\n\nWhile in captivity, Sotloff asked al-Baghdadi to debate Islam, saying, \u201cWoe to you. You said the month of Ramadan is the month of mercy. Where is your mercy?\u201d\n\nSotloff\u2014who reported for TIME, the National Interest, and Foreign Policy\u2014 was captured by ISIS in August 2013 while he was reporting on the civil war in Syria between Islamist forces and people loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nSotloff was reportedly executed by the same jihadi that slaughtered James Foley, according to the Guardian. The journalist\u2019s mother, Shirley Sotloff, released a video begging al-Baghdadi to release her son.\n\n\u201cMy son Steven is in your hands. You the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you please to release my child. I ask you to use your authority to spare his life,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nFamily and friends of Sotloff called him a \u201cgentle soul\u201d who enjoyed watching American football and South Park in his free time.\n\n4. Peter Kassig, an American Aid Worker and Army Ranger Who Converted to Islam\n\nKassig deployed to Iraq as an Army Ranger in 2007, but returned to the region on humanitarian grounds to help Syrian Civil War refugees in a Lebanese hospital.\n\n\u201cWe each get one life and that\u2019s it. The way I saw it, I didn\u2019t have a choice. This is what I was put here to do. I guess I am just a hopeless romantic, and I am an idealist, and I believe in hopeless causes,\u201d Kassig told CNN in a 2012 interview.\n\nKassig is said to have disappeared soon after while working in Syria, although a report from the New York Times said that he converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul-Rahman.\n\nIt is unclear whether he was forced to convert to Islam or chose to convert in the hopes that ISIS militants would save his life. In October 2014, Kassig\u2019s parents begged ISIS to release their son.\n\n\u201cWe implore his captors to show mercy, and use their power to let our son go,\u201d Kassig\u2019s father stated.\n\nKassig\u2019s mother, who was wearing a hijab, stated, \u201cWe implore those who are holding you to show mercy, and use their power to let you go.\u201d\n\nISIS later claimed responsibility for Kassig\u2019s graphic beheading in 2014.\n\nTrump named Kassig\u2014 along with Foley, Mueller, and Sotloff\u2014 in his statement on Sunday about the casualties suffered under al-Baghdadi.", "description": "A summary of four high profile Americans who died under\u00a0al-Baghdadi's reign before U.S. forces were able to kill him.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/04/Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi-islamic-state-caliph-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
