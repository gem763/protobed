Our institution's fundamental failure at the time to prevent this abuse was unacceptable -- as were the inadequate efforts to thoroughly investigate complaints raised by students and staff members.\"\n\n'Escalated over time'\n\nThe abuse, which included \"excessive\" genital exams and fondling, \"escalated over time\" as students underwent a series of examinations, according to the report.\n\n\"We find this range of acts 'abusive' because they exploited the power Strauss enjoyed purely by virtue of his status in the doctor-patient relationship,\" it said.\n\nPerkins Coie, the law firm that conducted the investigation, said it is also examining whether Strauss may have examined students of high school age while serving at the university.\n\nWhile Strauss resigned from university medical staff at the end of 1994, he remained on the faculty until retiring as professor emeritus in 1998, an honorary status the university is revoking.\n\nThe university is covering the costs of counseling for those affected by the abuse.\n\nDrake said his school has implemented safeguards since Strauss's departure, including a sexual violence consultation team, a centralized anonymous hotline, mandatory reporting of sexual assault for all university employees and mandatory sexual prevention education for incoming students, faculty and staff.\n\n\"Issues of sexual misconduct and abuse challenge our society in real and important ways,\" he added.\n\n\"It is our collective responsibility to remain ever-vigilant and work to ensure that this can never happen again.\"", "description": "An Ohio State University team doctor sexually abused at least 177 male students over nearly two decades and was never disciplined at the US school despite reports of his actions, an investigation found Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6677/817fb48bdbc04300a2c9a010743f9322.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-19"}
