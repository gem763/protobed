Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN).\n\n\u201cThere are few better examples of what unfettered corporate greed is doing to working people than what\u2019s going on in Michigan,\u201d Sanders said in a statement.\n\nHe continued:\n\nI look forward to spending the day with Rashida, hearing directly from people in her district because their concerns speak to the broader needs of the working class around the country, especially affordable housing and guaranteeing quality education and health care for all.\n\n.\u2066@BernieSanders\u2069 will join \u2066@RashidaTlaib\u2069 in Michigan for a tour of her district on Oct. 27, his campaign confirms.

There was an America that I dreamed about. There is an America that most people believe in,\u201d she said, adding that is just \u201can ideal\u201d and \u201cnot reality yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not just the fight for our lives. This is the fight for our democracy. This is the fight for a better future. One we can all be proud of,\u201d she continued:\n\n.@IlhanMN is a leader of strength and courage. She won't back down from a fight with billionaires and the world\u2019s most powerful corporations to transform our country so it works for all of us. Together we will build a multiracial working class coalition to win the White House. https://t.co/fQ6p9sLwle \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 16, 2019\n\nSanders, who teased a potential Ocasio-Cortez endorsement during the presidential debate, essentially confirmed it is on its way, announcing the socialist lawmaker as the special guest of his rally in Queens this weekend:\n\nI'm so excited to have @AOC join us at our rally in New York this weekend.
