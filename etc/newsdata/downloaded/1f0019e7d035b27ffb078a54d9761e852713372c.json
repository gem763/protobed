Secretary of state Mike Pompeo was on that president's phone call with Ukraine. The house has given him a Friday deadline to turn over documents. The president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is facing a new subpoena and impeachment inquiry and William Barr has traveled overseas to ask questions about the investigation and all this as president trump is targeting his accusers hoping to reveal the whistle-blower's identity. Our senior congressional correspondent Mary Bruce starts us off. Good morning, Mary. Reporter: Good morning, robin. This impeachment inquiry has only been under way for a week but swiftly gaining momentums and Democrats see roaring in on the rest's closest allies and new questions about whether the president hey have used his office for political gain. This morning, the pressure is heating up on president trump's inner circle. ABC news has learned that trump's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was listening in on that July phone call between trump and the Ukrainian president. The call at the center of the impeachment inquiry. The revelation comes after Pompeo told our Martha Raddatz he didn't know about the whistle-blower report of that call. And I want to turn to this whistle-blower complaint, Mr. Secretary. The complaint involving the president and a phone call with a foreign leader to the director of national intelligence inspector general. What do you know about those conversations? So, you just gave me a report about a whistle-blower complaint, none of which I've seen. Reporter: Congressional investigators have already subpoenaed Pompeo for documents amid questions about the state department's role and whether the agency gave instructions to the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. To the best of my knowledge and from what I've seen so far, each of the action that is were undertaken by state department officials was entirely appropriate. Reporter: Democrats also issuing a subpoena Monday to Giuliani seeking documents about his efforts to push Ukraine to invest trump's political rivals. Overnight Giuliani not sure if he'll comply. I don't know. I'm weighing the alternatives. I'll kind of like go through it. Get all my evidence together, get my charts. Reporter: While the impeachment inquiry is squarely focused on trump's call to the president of Ukraine, this morning, there are new questions about whether the president is using his office for personal political gain in other instances too. ABC news confirming the president recently asked the Australian prime minister to help his attorney general bill Barr dig into the origins of the Mueller investigation which trump has long claimed was a political hit job. A theory widely debunked by the U.S. Intelligence community. In a statement the white house said the doj simply requested that the president provide introductions to facility state that ongoing inquiry and he did so, that's all and we've learned Barr himself was in Italy just last week meeting with senior officials there. That trip also part of the justice department's ongoing investigation of the Mueller probe. Democrats are not happy about it. The attorney general really is functioning more as the president's personal attorney than as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. Reporter: Now as Democrats ramp up their investigation, the president is ramping up his attacks against the whistle-blower. Trump says he deserves to meet his accuser but the whistle-blower's attorney says his client is entitled to anonymity and that retaliating against this person would be a violation of federal law.
