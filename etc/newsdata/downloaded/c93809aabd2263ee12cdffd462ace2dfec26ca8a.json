David Berger announced his plan for the future of the Marine Corps. His strategies align with ideas recommended by Dakota Wood, a senior research fellow in The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy.\n\nWood, who served for two decades in the Marine Corps, outlined his recommendations in a May special report for Heritage, \u201cRebuilding America\u2019s Military: The United States Marine Corps.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat this shows is that The Heritage Foundation clearly understands the Marine Corps and the challenges facing them,\u201d Wood says. \u201cTo the extent the Marine Corps uses that understanding, it is valuable.\u201d\n\nWood\u2019s report, the first service paper in the Rebuilding America\u2019s Military Project (RAMP) series, makes the case for increased experimentation within the Marine Corps to prepare for the specific warfare conditions that are most likely to arise in the immediate future. Such experiments might suggest different ways of conducting amphibious operations.\n\nWood suggests that though the Marine Corps\u2019 increased ground capabilities and special operations forces have been useful in fighting the war on terror, the Corps must return its focus to its original purpose as a sea-to-land force, especially as the Indo-Pacific region becomes increasingly important to U.S. grand strategy.\n\nBerger announced five priorities in his Commandant\u2019s Planning Guide: force design, warfighting, education and training, core values, and command and leadership. In the past, the Marine Corps has expressed its desire to invest more in naval operations, but so far has not implemented those changes across the Corps.\n\nBerger emphasized that re-integration of the Navy and the Marine Corps is \u201can imperative.\u201d\n\n\u201cNavy and Marine Corps officers developed a tendency to view their operational responsibilities as separate and distinct, rather than intertwined,\u201d Berger\u2019s plan states. \u201cWith the rise of both land and sea-based threats to the global commons, there is a need to re-establish a more integrated approach to operations in the maritime domain.\u201d\n\nBecause future naval campaigns will likely include the littoral waters in the Indo-Pacific region, the Corps needs the ability to create \u201cflatter\u201d combat formations, which do not necessarily fit into the Marine Corps\u2019 traditional Marine Air Ground Task Force model, Wood explained.\n\nBerger\u2019s plan affirmed this.\n\n\u201cWe are not defined by any particular organizing construct\u2014the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) cannot be our only solution for all crises,\u201d Berger wrote. \u201cInstead, we are defined by our collective character as Marines and by fulfilling our service roles and functions prescribed by Congress.\u201d\n\nAs modern warfare continues to change in scope and shape, Wood stressed the necessity of the Marine Corps to pioneer not merely innovative hardware, but new methods of troop organization, experimenting incrementally.\n\nBerger also listed modernizing the Corps as one of his key warfighting priorities, specifically by distributed operations.\n\n\u201cNew threats, new missions, and new technologies require us to adjust our organizational design and modernize our capabilities,\u201d Berger\u2019s plan states. \u201cWhile others may wait for a clearer picture of the future operating environment, we will focus our efforts on driving change and influencing future operating environment outcomes.\u201d", "description": "Shortly after becoming the U.S. Marine Corps\u2019 38th commandant in July, Gen.
