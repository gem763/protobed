Democrats were reportedly prepared for some kind of a bombshell but instead were handed a 40-page packet of documents that included conspiracy theories and news clippings. The pages also referenced a slew of names related to the scandal: Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, Hunter Biden and George Soros.\n\nThe packet had a return address that matched that of the Manhattan office of Giuliani, who later confirmed that he was responsible for their production, telling The New York Times they came from a \u201cprofessional investigator who works for my company.\u201d\n\nThe documents prompted consternation from top Democrats, who issued public calls that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo explain how such misinformation made it to the top levels of government. Lawmakers also said the packet only provided more evidence that the White House had \u201csought to use the machinery of the State Department to further the President\u2019s personal political interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are now in possession of this packet of propaganda and disinformation,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) told Reuters on Wednesday. \u201cThe real question is where did it come from and how did it end up in our lap?\u201d\n\nThe chairs of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees released a joint statement earlier Wednesday expressing concerns about the \u201curgent\u201d briefing.\n\nThe statement said the meeting with Linick raised \u201ctroubling questions\u201d about alleged efforts by the Trump administration to target former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Yovanovitch, who was removed from her ambassadorship in May after Trump allies accused her of participating in an alleged Ukrainian attempt to support Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cThe documents provided by the Inspector General included a package of disinformation, debunked conspiracy theories, and baseless allegations in an envelope marked \u2018White House\u2019 and containing folders labeled \u2018Trump Hotel,\u2018\u201d the chairs\u2019 statement read.\n\nGiuliani told CNN that he had \u201crouted\u201d what he said was an \u201coutline\u201d of allegations against Biden and Yovanovitch to Pompeo\u2019s office in March. He also reportedly sent details about his talks from earlier this year with top Ukrainian prosecutors who helped give him information for his outline.\n\n\u201cThey told me they were going to investigate it,\u201d Giuliani told CNN.\n\nThe attorney and former New York mayor has become one of the central figures in the political whirlwind over Trump\u2019s call with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, on July 25. During the conversation, Trump repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for five years. Before the call, the Trump administration had been withholding military aid from Ukraine.\n\nA whistleblower complaint about the call mentioned Giuliani multiple times, and Trump\u2019s lawyer has said in television interviews that he met with Ukrainian operatives. But in recent days he\u2019s moved to minimize his role in the scandal, saying he got involved only at the behest of the State Department.\n\nHouse Democrats have been moving quickly to investigate the Ukraine call as part of their impeachment inquiry while Trump has raged about the effort. This week the president called the inquiry a \u201ccoup\u201d and has been refusing to answer some reporters\u2019 questions about the information that\u2019s come out of transcripts of the call.", "description": "Trump's attorney told CNN he had \"routed\" an \"outline\" of allegations to Mike Pompeo, who told him they would \"investigate it.\"", "authors": ["Reporter", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d957419210000330051c6db.jpeg?cache=5qfxl4ufb0&ops=1778_1000"}
