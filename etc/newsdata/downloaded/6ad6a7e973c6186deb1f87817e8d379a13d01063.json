The rally was originally called to protest a government ban on masks and comes after Wednesday\u2019s attack on Civil Human Rights Front\u2019s organizer Jimmy Sham by hammer-wielding thugs in Mong Kok.\n\nProtesters are seeking to keep the pressure on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam with a 20th straight weekend of demonstrations. Earlier this week, Lam was twice shouted down in the city\u2019s legislature by opposition lawmakers as she discussed her annual policy address.\n\nThe protests began in opposition to Lam\u2019s since-scrapped bill allowing extraditions to mainland China and have expanded to include calls for greater democracy and an independent inquiry. The unrest has turned increasingly violent, with frequent clashes between protesters and police.\n\nHere\u2019s the latest (all times local):\n\nMarch to go ahead (5:17 p.m.)\n\nCivil Human Rights Front convener Figo Chan said he will lead a march Sunday along the route originally planned and he will be joined by other prominent pro-democracy activists including Leung Kwok-hung, Albert Ho and Cyd Ho, RTHK reported.\n\nDemonstrators planned to walk from Tsim Sha Tsui to the express rail terminus in West Kowloon before the police banned the march. The protesters could face arrest, but all of the city\u2019s protests have had to deal with risks, whether they received police permission or not, RTHK cited Chan as saying.\n\nMarch ban upheld (2:30 p.m.)\n\nHong Kong protesters lost an appeal against the police ban of their planned march on Sunday through Tsim Sha Tsui on concern about violence, RTHK reported.\n\nOrganizers had planned to march through Tsim Sha Tsui to the west side of the district, where the high-speed train station to mainland China is located. Civil Human Rights Front Sham was one of the organizers of the event.\n\nDespite the police ban, protesters could still go ahead with the march. Activists mostly ignore restrictions on their gatherings and have continued to show up at events that lack police permits, with some devolving into violent clashes.\n\nOn Friday night protesters formed human chains citywide, with everyone covering their faces in some way in defiance of the mask ban. People masqueraded as Disney characters, animals and super heroes, but the most popular mask was one of China President Xi Jinping. In Tsim Sha Tsui a long line of protesters linked hands, all wearing a facade of Xi\u2019s smiling face.\n\nLam may reshuffle ExCo (1 p.m.)\n\nChief Executive Lam said she would consider reorganizing the city\u2019s Executive Council, its de facto Cabinet, but would wait until protests had ended.\n\nThe beleaguered leader of Hong Kong said on an RTHK radio program that she doesn\u2019t \u201cblindly\u201d support the actions of each officer but fully supports the force in enforcing the law. She urged people to wait for a report from Independent Police Complaints Council into the recent clashes, RTHK said. Lam again rejected calls for an independent inquiry into police brutality, the latest coming from Chinese University\u2019s vice-chancellor, Rocky Tuan.\n\nTaiwan gets letter (10:45 a.m.)\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Criminal Investigation Bureau confirmed it had received a letter from the Hong Kong police offering assistance in the case of Chan Tong-kai, Central News Agency reported.\n\nThere is no precedent for the cooperation and the Taiwan bureau will follow up with relevant departments for discussion, CNA reported.\n\nHomicide suspect to surrender himself to Taiwan (11:28 p.m.)\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive received a letter Friday from Chan Tong-kai, a Hong Kong man who\u2019s been accused of killing his pregnant girlfriend during a Valentine\u2019s Day trip to Taiwan, saying that he\u2019d decided to surrender himself to Taiwan, according to a statement on the website of Hong Kong\u2019s government.\n\nChan, who\u2019s currently serving a prison sentence for money laundering in a Hong Kong jail, \u201crequested the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government to assist him in making the relevant arrangement,\u201d according to the statement.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong protest organizers said they would lead demonstrators through Kowloon on Sunday in a march despite losing an appeal against a police ban on the procession.The Appeal Board on Public Meetings and Processions supported the police\u2019s refusal to approve the march because of the potential", "authors": ["Iain Marlow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rFYpN6Ydo5bYkb08oD5ARw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/65f727c71ba5785bdb2343b31b2edafd", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
