The men caused a pornographic video to play on both sides of the billboard, which is located next to Interstate 75, around 11pm on Saturday evening. Videos of the billboard quickly began to circulate on social media (link is mildly NSFW).\n\n\"Two suspects entered a small building, which houses a computer that runs the content for the digital billboard, located underneath the sign,\" Auburn Hills police reported in a Facebook page. Police shared surveillance footage showing the two men with their faces obscured by glasses and by hoodies pulled tight around their heads.\n\n\"The suspects forced entry into the building, which is also secured by a 6 foot fence,\" the police reported. \"The suspects were inside the building for approximately 15 minutes before leaving.\"\n\n\"It was dark out, so the screen was glowing really bright,\" police officer Ryan Gagnon told the Detroit Free Press.\n\nPolice contacted the company that owns the sign, which shut off the offensive video within about 20 minutes.\n\nPolice say that promoting pornography\u2014especially to any minors who might have been on the freeway at the time\u2014carries a penalty of up to $500 and 90 days in jail. They also face possible felony burglary charges, since they had to break into the control room in order to play the video.", "description": "Pornographic video could be seen along I-75 for 15 to 20 minutes, police say.", "authors": ["Timothy B.
