Trump needs a new pal in the region.\n\nThe resignation of a nation\u2019s Prime Minister would have immediate consequences in many countries, but in Lebanon the announcement by Saad Hariri this week that he is stepping down is just the start of what is likely to prove a long, tumultuous journey on the road to economic and political recovery.\n\nAt a time when they need strong, stable leadership, the Lebanese people find themselves facing increasing tension on all fronts with a crumbling economy, US sanctions, a Syrian refugee problem, troublesome Hezbollah militia and the ever-likely prospect of war with Israel.\n\nAlso on rt.com Lebanese PM Hariri announces resignation amid large-scale protests\n\nHariri\u2019s exit from centre stage also leaves the USA minus one of its key allies at a time when the disappointment over the withdrawal of its troops from Syria, an ongoing dispute with Iran and a cooling of relations with Saudi Arabia mean it really could do with some close friends in the neighbourhood.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to get the ball rolling on Tuesday, issuing a statement saying, \u201cThe United States calls on Lebanon\u2019s political leaders to urgently facilitate the formation of a new government that can build a stable, prosperous, and secure Lebanon that is responsive to the needs of its citizens.\u201d\n\nUrgently facilitate? Now that might prove difficult as Lebanon has a penchant for taking its time in forming governments, spending, on average, several months in the process. It took more than two years to find its current president and nine months to create Hariri\u2019s government.\n\nAlso on rt.com Iran\u2019s Khamenei says US & allies behind public turmoil in Iraq, Lebanon after Hariri resignation\n\nThe urgency that Pompeo means centres around his nation\u2019s need to address a power vacuum left by the departing leader. Because in President Trump\u2019s continuing dispute with Iran, Lebanon is smack bang in the middle as home to Hezbollah who, thanks to their backing from the mullahs, take the Israel-Iran dispute right up to the Israeli border.\n\nHezbollah are very serious players. Created by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, they hold three cabinet seats in government and have more power domestically than the Lebanese armed forces.\n\nThe US, in looking for ways to strong-arm Iran, has realised that the financial support given to Hezbollah that comes from the Lebanese banking reveals a vulnerability. Those same banks need to do global business to stay on their feet leaving them open to US sanctions which can prevent them from trading internationally, crippling the banks and cutting them off as source of funding for the militants.\n\nThe recent case of Lebanon\u2019s Jammal Trust Bank is typical. The bank was sanctioned by the US for \u201cknowingly facilitating banking activities\u201d for Hezbollah militants \u2013 which it denied \u2013 and just weeks later was forced to go into self-liquidation. When this happens repeatedly it obviously hurts Lebanon\u2019s banking system and steps need to be taken to avoid it. If that means doing what your US ally wants, then there is the route avoiding potential collapse of the entire financial network.\n\nThen, on a slightly smaller scale, there are the US sanctions against two Hezbollah politicians and a security official in July of this year, sending yet another message to the Lebanese government that they really do need to get their house in order.\n\nAlso on rt.com Hezbollah warns of chaos in Lebanon, rejects protesters\u2019 demands to bring down govt\n\nYou start to understand that because no one is suggesting that sanctions are used lightly, President Trump views having an on-message Prime Minister in power in Beirut as essential to the success of a broader strategy.\n\nHariri was that friendly face and he needed support in dealing with not only Hezbollah, but also his Syrian neighbours. In a country of just over 6 million people, Lebanon was hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees and that was taking an economic and political toll at home.\n\nHe felt emboldened against Assad as long as he had American support, but as we have seen, that support came with lots of conditions. Then, when the US withdrew from Syria, Hariri saw that play disappear. The other big power in the region was Russia and he hadn\u2019t been that nice about them in the past.\n\nRead more\n\nHe told one interviewer that Russia\u2019s appearance in the region as an active player was the \u201cunfortunate consequence\u201d of Barack Obama\u2019s refusal to become embroiled in the Middle East disputes and those comments would certainly have been noted in Moscow for future reference.\n\n\n\nWhile Lebanon goes about the lengthy process of sorting out its new government, probably with President Michael Aoun asking Hariri to stick around as caretaker until the matter is resolved, Lebanon needs to consider who, among the world powers would make the best of allies going forward.\n\n\n\nIs it President Trump, with an election next year and the associated risks of that? He does have a hawkish stance on Iran which suits the Lebanese. Or is it Russia? Still active in Syria, but making close friends in the region \u2013 particularly Egypt \u2013 and Africa, where its \u2018no strings attached\u2019 efforts to broker business were a centrepiece of last week\u2019s Russia-Africa forum in Sochi.\n\n\n\nThe people of the nation certainly deserve a break. Their 170km long, 170,000 person-strong human chain spanning from north to south of their country shows that, despite being an incredibly diverse society, with religions and ethnicity of all persuasions, the people of Lebanon are united in one belief: It is time for change.\n\nBy Damian Wilson, UK journalist & political communications specialist\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
