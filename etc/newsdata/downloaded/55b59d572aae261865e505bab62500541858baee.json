And while Miley's relationship with Kaitlynn Carter wasn't to be, she has since found love again with Cody Simpson - who she has been calling her boyfriend on Instagram Stories, and has reportedly moved in with her.\n\nLiam Hemsworth, meanwhile, was spotted holding hands with Australian actress Maddison Brown, who reports claim he is keen on getting to know.\n\nBut if you thought that meant Miley and Liam were exes on good terms, you've got another thing coming, after the singer subtly said her ex-husband was not a good person during an Instagram live stream.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up, you don\u2019t have to be gay, there are good dicks out there, you just have to find them\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI always thought I had to be gay because all guys are evil but that\u2019s not true\u201d\n\n\n\n- @MileyCyrus what's good? pic.twitter.com/y3yjUGpCSN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 \u2022 (@bljcmie) October 21, 2019\n\nDuring a Q&A with fans over the weekend [20 August 2019], Miley told followers: \"There are good men out there, guys, don't give up. You don't have to be gay, there are good people with d**ks out there, you've just got to find them. You've got to find a d**k that's not a d**k, you know.\n\n\"I always thought I had to be gay, because I thought all guys were evil, but it's not true. There are good people out there that just happen to have d**ks. I've only ever met one, and he's on this live.\"\n\nThe one man she's referring to is Cody Simpson, who pops up on the live stream. Fans are taking this to mean Miley thinks ex-husband Liam is not a good person, or is \"evil\". Wow.\n\nThe live stream comes as Cody's manager Matt Zeidman shed some light on how Miley and Cody's relationship is going. Speaking to People, he said, \"It is early, but their friendship is long-standing and deeper than people realise. Though they originally met during their own wilder phases, they\u2019re both sober now and are focused on health, work and spending time together. Seems pretty ideal to me.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Shots are fired", "authors": ["Dusty Baxter-Wright"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T6CzLSKW6VvZpKAz.seWfA--~B/aD01MDI7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/79842cac5681c76d19b8ec8f4e361114", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
