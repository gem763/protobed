Lewis also connected to end Reds righty Trevor Bauer\u2019s no-hit bid Tuesday night in the fifth inning of the outfielder\u2019s major league debut.\n\nGray allowed a single to Daniel Vogelbach before being lifted trailing 3-2. He struck out nine, walked three, hit two batters and allowed two hits on 111 pitches.\n\nSeattle has already been no-hit twice this season, by the Los Angeles Angels on July 12 and the Houston Astros on Aug. 3. No club has ever been no-hit three times.\n\nDee Gordon nearly had a hit in the third inning when he bounced a comebacker off the back of Gray\u2019s knee, but Gray calmly scooped up the ball and got the out. Phillip Ervin also tracked down a hard-hit ball by rookie Kyle Lewis in the right-center field gap in the fifth.\n\nThe Reds turned a first-inning double play and picked off Donnie Walton trying to steal after an eight-pitch walk in the third. It was the second night in a row the Mariners failed to get a hit through five innings against the Reds.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cincinnati Reds right-hander Sonny Gray lost a no-hit bid in the seventh inning when Seattle Mariners rookie Kyle Lewis hit a three-run homer Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Chris Talbott"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/reds_mariners_baseball_42665_c0-125-2988-1867_s1770x1032.jpg?6f79bb54c00bef5f619c0daa9aeb02235d559025", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
