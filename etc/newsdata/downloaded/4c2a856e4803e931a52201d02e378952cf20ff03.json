The LA Galaxy forward is notorious for his ridiculous, boastful quotes. But on Thursday night, following the Galaxy\u2019s loss to LAFC in the MLS playoffs, Ibrahimovi\u0107 let his actions do the talking.\n\nAfter a 5-3 loss, he turned to a fan and grabbed his crotch \u2014 adding another incident to a lengthy compilation of mischief.\n\nWhen the final whistle sounded, one particularly excited LAFC fan yelled at Ibrahimovi\u0107 while he walked off the pitch. At first, the forward seemed to take no notice. But as the fan edged closer, Ibrahimovi\u0107 reached for his private parts and stared the heckler down. Ibrahimovi\u0107 was escorted off while the fan continued to shout.\n\nBOLD PREDICTIONS: For Week 9 in college football\n\nSTART BELIEVING: It might finally be time to bet on Kirk Cousins, Minnesota Vikings\n\nLos Angeles Galaxy forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic (9) reacts during the second half against the Los Angeles FC at Banc of California Stadium. (Photo: Kelvin Kuo, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 had a bad night by his lofty standards. In the biggest game of the season, he scored once and was largely shut down by an otherwise sloppy LAFC defense. And the home fans let him know about it, constantly heckling and jeering when he touched the ball.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' messages to MLS for comment on potential discipline were not immediately returned.\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 also made headlines after the LAFC game. Carlos Vela, Ibrahimovi\u0107\u2019s main rival for MLS MVP, scored twice for LAFC. The second goal was controversial, with Vela appearing offsides in the buildup.\n\nWarning: This video contains material some might find offensive\n\nZlatan not having any of your trash talk... as he reaches for his \u201cman region\u201d in response #ElTrafficopic.twitter.com/XSaWwbEA9r \u2014 Jorge Sedano (@Sedano) October 25, 2019\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 made his take on the no-call clear following the match: \u201cThe referee didn't know that? What was he doing upstairs, drinking coffee with Magic Johnson?\u201d Ibrahimovi\u0107 said. (Johnson participated in pregame ceremonies.)\n\nIt was a sour end to what could be Ibrahimovi\u0107\u2019s last game in the MLS. His contract expires in two months and there\u2019s speculation that he could return to Italy on a short-term deal. In a postgame press conference, he described his future in the only way he can.\n\n\"We'll see what happens. ... (If I stay), then MLS is good, because the whole world will watch it. If I don't stay, nobody will remember what MLS is.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that he\u2019s made such a gesture. In 2016, while playing for Manchester United, Ibrahimovi\u0107 glared at Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi of Manchester City and reached for his crotch. He received a yellow card for his troubles but was not suspended by the English Football Association.", "description": "The soccer star made headlines again, but not for a cocky quote.
