The quarterback is one of 10 of those transfers from the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\n\u201cIt was a big part of why I came, is just to be close to home and be around a bunch of guys that are from this area,\u201d Buechele said. \u201cIt\u2019s been awesome to be around a bunch of guys that I have heard of or known.\u201d\n\nThere are 23 players overall on SMU\u2019s roster who were previously at other Division I schools. At least four of the seven grad transfers are eligible to play this year and next, including Buechele and Brandon Stephens, a running back at UCLA and now a starting junior cornerback playing near his hometown of Plano.\n\n\u201cThis is a great fit for me to come back and play corner and be back home,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThe first day I even stepped on campus, I just saw something. These guys were hungry to just be great. \u2026 It was eye-opening and inspiring to keep working and bring SMU back on the map.\u201d\n\nSMU is 6-0 for the first time since 1982, the Pony Express days with Eric Dickerson and Craig James when the Mustangs went on to an 11-0-1 season. They had last been in the AP poll in October 1986, just before the NCAA death penalty punishments and not fielding a team in 1987 and 1988.\n\nThe players aren\u2019t the only ones feeling like they came home. Second-year coach Sonny Dykes is in a similar situation.\n\nDykes, the Texas-born son of the late Spike Dykes, was out of the Lone Star State for a decade before a short stint as an offensive analyst at TCU. He became SMU coach in December 2017 after Chad Morris left for Arkansas, and his Mustangs debut came in a bowl game.\n\n\u201cHaving a chance to come back I think really has been special for a lot of these guys, and I think they appreciate it. Because they went off and went someplace else, and they appreciate knowing people and having people that are looking out for their best interest, and having family and being able to see them more,\u201d said Dykes, also the former coach at Louisiana Tech and California. \u201cAnd I feel the same way.\u201d\n\nBuechele is the American Athletic Conference\u2019s top passer with 1,665 yards halfway through the regular season.\n\nThe full-time starter as a freshman for the Texas Longhorns in 2016, Buechele then split starts with freshman Shane Ehlinger the following season. Buechele played in only two games last season, preserving that year of eligibility, though he didn\u2019t get to go through spring drills with SMU while finishing his degree at Texas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been good to be successful and winning. It\u2019s been a lot of fun just being in this program, not turning things around, but helping go in the right direction,\u201d Buechele said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a bunch of people with chips on their shoulders here, that we play hard all of the time no matter what, and I think that\u2019s really cool to be around.\u201d\n\nHis top targets are two of the league\u2019s top receivers - fifth-year SMU player James Proche (seven TDs, 88.2 yards receiving per game) and former West Virginia receiver Reggie Roberson Jr. (three TDs, 90.8 yards per game) from nearby DeSoto.\n\nSMU\u2019s top tacklers, with 38 each, began their careers in their home states: safety Patrick Nelson at Illinois and Richard McBryde at Auburn.\n\nWhen Dykes got to the Hilltop, he hadn\u2019t planned on going out and adding a bunch of players from the transfer portal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the way it turned out,\u201d Dykes said. \u201cOur first year here, we just all of a sudden started getting kids that were reaching out to us, through a high school coach or through a teammate, or whatever. They were just kind of saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019d like to come back home\u2019.\u201d\n\nDykes loves recruiting kids from Texas, and still is building the program with high school players - there are 41 true freshmen and 11 other redshirt freshmen listed on SMU\u2019s full 132-man roster. But the transfers filled some significant needs.\n\n\u201cIt helped,\u201d Dykes said. \u201cIt\u2019s given our team some maturity and given us some depth, and these guys have come in and acclimated themselves remarkably well.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Shane Buechele is having the kind of season so many envisioned after the quarterback started all 12 games as a true freshman in the Big 12 Conference three years ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/smu_home_transfers_football_58505_c0-90-2160-1350_s1200x700.jpg?513e8e90a259d08de3615c8fbaacb43b54736ccf", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
