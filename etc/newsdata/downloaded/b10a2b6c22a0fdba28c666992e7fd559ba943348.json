They may not feel an ounce of guilt, remorse or sorrow, but their instinct for survival is strong enough to send a red alert.\n\nNot so with President Trump. The first question I had after reading the White House reconstruction of the July 25 phone call, in which he prods Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to interfere with an American election, was: How could they release this?\n\n\u201cIt turned out to be a nothing call,\u201d Trump said. He also described it as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cperfect\u201d and asked for an apology from his critics.\n\nThis was a \u201cnothing call\u201d only to a man with nothing for a moral foundation. This was exculpatory only to someone who thinks that the crime he has just outlined for all the world to see does not matter. This was \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cperfect\u201d only to someone who has crossed so many lines in his life that he has no idea where the boundaries are.", "description": "Trump sees the Ukraine call as a \u201cnothing\u201d because he has spent his entire adult life skirting, mocking, ignoring or breaking the law.", "authors": ["Timothy Egan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/opinion/27Egan/27Egan-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
