(Sept. 26) AP Domestic\n\nAt the conclusion of Prince Harry, Duchess Meghan and baby Archie's 10-day tour of five southern African countries \u2013 the trio's first royal visit as a family \u2013 the couple called for global action to take concrete steps toward fighting pressing issues.\n\nThe royals touched on the many causes they supported and learned more about from the trip in a series of speeches at Johannesburg, South Africa-based events Wednesday. Throughout their visit, they've met with community members around the continent working to fix issues of global warming, poverty, gender-based violence, and access to education.\n\n\"I remember being a young girl watching TV and seeing what was happening in the world and frankly, often feeling despair,\" Duchess Meghan said during a reception for Creative Industries and Business. \"Because when you continue and constantly see and hear negativity, it can be overwhelming; you can feel powerless and lost, you can feel different, confused or like you don\u2019t belong.\"\n\nDuchess Meghan speaks during a reception to celebrate the UK and South Africa's business and investment relationship at the High Commissioners Residence on Oct. 02 in Johannesburg, South Africa.

In a world that that can seem so aggressive, confrontational and dangerous, you should know that you have the power to change it.\"\n\nThe royal tour began Sept. 23 in Cape Town, South Africa. Two days later, Harry and Meghan shared a rare glimpse of baby Archie \u2013 his first royal engagement! \u2013 as they visited retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his wife, Nomalizo Leah Shenxane.\n\nMore Africa tour highlights: Prince Harry recreates unforgettable Princess Diana moment\n\nThe couple later conducted a series of community visits separately, as Harry went ahead to Botswana while the Duchess stayed behind hundreds of miles away in South Africa with Archie. Meghan told reporters Tuesday she missed her husband \"so much\" and was excited for their reunion.\n\nSpeaking at the Youth Employment Services on Wednesday, Prince Harry, accompanied by his wife, called Africa his \"second home\" and explained that part of his love for the continent stemmed from the welcoming he received on his first trip in 1997 following the death of his mother, Princess Diana.\n\n\"Despite extreme hardship and ongoing challenges on so many levels, people are generous, they are strong, humble and incredibly optimistic,\" he said. \"I have seen strength, resilience, a sense of hope and empathy that I can only aspire to replicate. Ever since I came to this continent as a young boy, trying to cope with something I can never possibly describe, Africa has held me in an embrace that I will never forget and I feel incredibly fortunate for that.\"\n\nPrince Harry delivers a speech at the Youth Employment Services in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Oct. 2, as Duchess Meghan watches.
