You see, I kind of like gun buybacks.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. I think they\u2019re idiotic, and they don\u2019t accomplish much of what they\u2019re supposed to accomplish, but I tend to get a good chuckle out of stuff that\u2019s been turned in. I\u2019ve seen \u201cfirearms\u201d that were little more than a pipe on a piece of wood. I\u2019ve seen law enforcement brag about taking a \u201cbazooka\u201d off the streets when it was nothing more than a training aid. Sometimes, buybacks give us plenty to cackle about.\n\nThe buyback in Clermont, Florida is no exception.\n\nClermont police collected 27 guns Thursday while playing their part in the annual Central Florida Kicks 4 Guns campaign, in which residents handed over guns, no questions asked, at a drop-off station at Stormy Hill Harley-Davidson on U.S. 27 in exchange for Walmart gift cards. Clermont Sgt. Malcolm Draper said visitors came in waves to drop off unwanted firearms, which mostly meant rifles and handguns. \u201cFor us that\u2019s a decent turnout,\u201d Draper said. When the Clermont Police Department ran a station in 2018, they only collected a little over a dozen. In total, over 300 guns were collected this year across Central Florida at stations in Orange and Volusia counties as well as Clermont.\n\nSo they got all kinds of deadly weapons off the streets of central Florida, right?\n\nWell\u2026not so much.\n\nWhile photos aren\u2019t included with the rest of the metro area, which includes Orlando, the photos for Clermont show us some of what was turned in. Perhaps the most humorous to me might be what looks like a small-caliber muzzleloader that might not even be a functional weapon.\n\nI\u2019m sure a Red Coat is prowling around Florida right now feeling much safer today thanks to the buyback.\n\nThe rest of the firearms shown appear to be inexpensive .22 rifles, though there\u2019s at least one shotgun that had gotten the tacticool treatment somewhere along the line. They also have a couple of handguns photographed, but not so well that I could identify the make.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s par for the course for a buyback event. They didn\u2019t get any guns that represent real threats to the population.\n\nPlus, if you look at 300 guns from an area that represents roughly 2.5 million people, I\u2019m not entirely convinced that even amounts to a drop in the bucket of all the firearms out there.\n\nHonestly, that\u2019s not surprising.\n\nYou see, criminals aren\u2019t going to sell back guns unless they need to dump them for some reason. I mean, guns are the \u201ctools of the trade\u201d for these people. Would a carpenter sell his hammer? Would a mechanic sell his wrench? Of course not, so why anyone would think a criminal would do so with his gun is beyond me.\n\nThese buybacks continue to spend money with no appreciable return on that investment. It\u2019s nothing more than an effort that lets people pat themselves on the back for all the good they\u2019re doing without having done any good.", "description": "Among those turned in at the Clermont, FL location was one muzzleloader that might not even be functional.
