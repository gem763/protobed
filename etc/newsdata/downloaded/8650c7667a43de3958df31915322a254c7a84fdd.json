By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.\n\nA president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won\u2019t act and believes Congress won\u2019t either. Today\u2019s news confirmed he thinks he\u2019s above the law. If we do nothing, he\u2019ll be right.\n\nMitch McConnell is also complicit. The Senate must vote on the bill, already passed by the House, to help states and localities protect themselves from the foreign attacks on our elections that the President has previously welcomed.\n\nIn 1974, Democrats and Republicans united in support of impeachment not out of mutual contempt for Nixon but mutual respect for the rule of law. Congress refused to be complicit in future law-breaking by Nixon or other presidents. It\u2019s time for this Congress to step up and act.", "description": "", "authors": ["Elizabeth Warren", "Twitter.Com Ewarren Status"], "top_image": ""}
