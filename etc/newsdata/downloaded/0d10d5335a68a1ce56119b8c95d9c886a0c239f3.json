Korean peak", "language": "en", "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to surmount U.S.-led sanctions on his country in state media reports Wednesday alongside evocative propaganda images of him riding a white horse seen as foretelling significant decisions before his own deadline for U.S. movement on nuclear talks expires.\n\nThe images in his country\u2019s official media showed Kim riding a white horse to climb a snow-covered Mount Paektu, the location and the animal both symbols associated with the Kim family\u2019s dynastic rule. The highest point on the Korean Peninsula is sacred to North Koreans and Kim has visited it before making previous major decisions such as the 2013 execution of his powerful uncle and his 2018 entrance into diplomacy with Seoul and Washington.\n\nThe images and Kim\u2019s comments were released days after his country\u2019s first nuclear negotiations with the U.S. in more than seven months fell apart.\n\nSouth Korean media quickly speculated Kim may be considering a new strategy in his dealings with the U.S. because he\u2019s previously demanded Washington come up with new proposals to salvage the stalemated diplomacy by the end of December.\n\n\u201cHe, sitting on the horseback atop Mt Paektu, recollected with deep emotion the road of arduous struggle he covered for the great cause of building the most powerful country with faith and will as firm as Mt Paektu,\u201d the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said.\n\nNorth Korean documents say Kim\u2019s grandfather and national founder Kim Il Sung had an anti-Japan guerrilla base on the slopes of Paektu during Japan\u2019s 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. The official biography of Kim Jong Un\u2019s father, Kim Jong Il, says the second-generation leader was born on Paektu when a double rainbow filled the skies.\n\nThe white horse is also a propaganda symbol for the Kim family that has ruled North Korea for seven decades with a strong personality cult surrounding family members. State media have occasionally shown Kim, his sister and his father riding white horses. The symbolism goes back to Kim Il Sung, who according to the North\u2019s official narrative, rode a white horse while fighting against Japanese colonial rulers.\n\nKCNA said Kim also visited nearby construction sites in Samjiyon County and complained about U.S.-led U.N. sanctions imposed on his country because of its nuclear and nuclear programs.\n\n\u201cThe situation of the country is difficult owing to the ceaseless sanctions and pressure by the hostile forces and there are many hardships and trials facing us,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying. \u201cBut our people grew stronger through the trials and found their own way of development and learned how to always win in the face of trials.\u201d\n\nKim also said \u201cthe pain the U.S.-led anti-(North Korea) hostile forces inflicted upon the Korean people \u2026 turned into their anger,\u201d according to KCNA. \u201cNo matter what persistent efforts the enemy make, we can live well with our own efforts and pave the avenue to development and prosperity in our own way.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea has been slapped with a total of 11 rounds of sanctions since 2006. The sanctions have been toughened since 2016 when Kim began conducting a series of high-profile nuclear and missile tests, and they include a full ban on key exports such as coal, textiles and seafood and a significant curtailing of oil imports.\n\nDuring his second summit with President Donald Trump in Vietnam in February, Kim demanded the United States lift the newer and more biting sanctions in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearization step. Trump rejected that, and the summit collapsed without reaching any deal. The two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June and agreed to resume talks.\n\nTheir nuclear negotiators met in Stockholm for the first time since the Vietnam summit earlier this month but the talks broke down again. North Korea blamed the U.S. for the talks\u2019 breakdown and threatened to resume nuclear and long-range missile tests.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.", "description": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to surmount U.S.-led sanctions on his country in state media reports Wednesday alongside", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/83f566_north-korea-us-nuclear-diplomacy-96535-in-undated-photo-on-wednesday-oct-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
