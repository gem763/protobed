As tensions mounted, looters struck a pharmacy.\n\nA week-long state of emergency that had seen 20,000 police and soldiers deployed on the streets ended at midnight going into Monday.\n\nOn Saturday, Pinera canceled nighttime curfews that had begun a day after violent protests broke out.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Get up earlier\u2019 \u2013\n\nFinance Minister Felipe Larrain, who was among the axed cabinet members, came under fire last month for recommending that \u201cromantics\u201d buy flowers, after announcing that inflation hadn\u2019t risen and they were even cheaper.\n\nAlso on the way out was Economy Minister Andres Fontaine, who fell afoul of public opinion when he advised disgruntled workers to \u201cget up earlier\u201d to avoid an increase in peak hour metro prices.\n\nThe three percent rise was the spark that triggered the worst political violence Chile has seen since it returned to democracy after the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship from 1973-1990.\n\nFormer Santiago governor Karla Rubilar, who was praised for her sympathetic reaction to protesters, has been made minister for the general secretariat of the government.\n\nPinera announced plans for the cabinet overhaul on Saturday, his third reshuffle in 15 months.\n\nLast week he offered a raft of measures aimed at calming the public ire, including a hike in the minimum wage and pensions, some reductions in health care costs, and a streamlining of parliament.\n\nSpeaking at the presidential palace on Monday, Pinera said that \u201cthese measures won\u2019t solve all our problems but they are an important first step.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey reflect the firm will of our government and the strong commitment of each of us in favor of a socially more just and equitable Chile,\u201d added Pinera, a wealthy businessman who was elected to a second term in March 2018, having previously served as president between 2010 and 2014.\n\nDespite his attempts to appease the masses, Pinera\u2019s approval rating has dropped to 14 percent.", "description": "Santiago (AFP) \u2013 Chilean protesters clashed with security forces on Monday, several hours after embattled President Sebastian Pinera announced a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/573e73_demonstrators-presidential-palace-as-la-moneda-in-santiago-chile-president-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
