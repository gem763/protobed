Colbert asked him about the news Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the call.\n\nClinton said that, during the Obama administration, the government prepared for phone calls with foreign leaders, usually looping in the State Department and Defense Department. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got a president who doesn\u2019t listen to anybody and doesn\u2019t follow instructions whatsoever, I\u2019m not sure if they have given up giving him preparation.\u201d\n\nThe White House maintains the House impeachment inquiry is politically motivated, and Trump says he was trying to focus on the conduct of former Vice President Joe Biden, whose son served as a lawyer for a Ukrainian natural gas company. Both Bidens have denied any allegation of wrongdoing.", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t mincing words about why White House staff tried to limit President Donald Trump\u2019s now-controversial call...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB079_clinto_ZG_20181231143229.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
