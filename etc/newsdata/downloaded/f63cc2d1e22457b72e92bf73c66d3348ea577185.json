Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to lobby Grassley and other senators on legislation to shore up union pension funds. John Conrad III, who\u2019s known Grassley since the 1970s and worked for him in the 1990s, said in an interview that he plans to lobby on the Butch Lewis Act, a bill supported by the Teamsters that passed the House in July. Grassley is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to which the House bill was referred. He\u2019s also working on his own bill, which Conrad said he\u2019s close to finishing. Asked in an interview whether he thought the Teamsters had hired him in part because of his relationship with Grassley, Conrad said, \u201cI believe so.\u201d\n\nNO, A TIMES COLUMNIST DIDN\u2019T GIVE TO BIDEN\u2019S CAMPAIGN: Buried deep in the Federal Election Commission report that Joe Biden\u2019s campaign filed last week is a name that stands out: Thomas Edsall, who gave $2,800 to Biden\u2019s campaign on Sept. 18. Edsall\u2019s employer is listed in the report as \u201cThe New York Times/Columbia University\u201d and his occupation is listed as \u201cJournalist/Professor.\u201d\n\n\u2014 But the Thomas B. Edsall who writes a weekly column on politics for The New York Times and teaches at Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism never gave to Biden\u2019s campaign \u2014 something that Times ethics rules prohibit its reporters, editors and columnists from doing. He\u2019s never given to a campaign in his life, he wrote in an email to PI. The contribution was made by Thomas L. Edsall, a Maryland rare books dealer who said he didn\u2019t remember listing his occupation when he gave to Biden. \u201cI have nothing to do with the The New York Times other than being a subscriber,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\n\u2014 How did one Edsall get confused for another? \u201cEdsall's donation was made without an address or contact information,\u201d a Biden campaign spokesperson wrote in an email to PI. \u201cAs required by the FEC for donations over $200, we made our best attempt to identify him, but a staff error resulted in incorrect information being included. We caught the mistake and have fixed it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 There\u2019s nothing in the law that prohibits political campaigns from making educated guesses when it comes to identifying their contributors. Federal law only requires campaigns to make their \u201cbest efforts\u201d to figure out their addresses, employers and occupations of their donors. The Biden campaign\u2019s mistake \u201cdoesn\u2019t strike me as problematic,\u201d said David Kolker, a former FEC lawyer who\u2019s now a senior counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, in an interview.\n\nA message from CITGO: CITGO is vital to America\u2019s economy and energy security.

The trade group also retains half a dozen other lobbying firms. Pebble Limited Partnership, which is trying to develop an open-pit mine in Alaska, has hired John Sterne, a former aide to Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), to lobby for the project. Pebble retains four other lobbying firms and has spent more than $1.2 million on Washington lobbying so far this year, according to disclosure filings. And Mastercard has added United by Interest to its lineup of outside lobbying firms.\n\nIF YOU MISSED IT ON WEDNESDAY: \"Comcast is lobbying U.S. lawmakers against plans to encrypt web traffic that would make it harder for internet service providers (ISPs) to determine your browsing history, according to a lobbying presentation obtained by Motherboard,\" Vice News' Joseph Cox reports. \"The plan, which Google intends to implement soon, would enforce the encryption of DNS data made using Chrome, meaning the sites you visit. Privacy activists have praised Google's move. But ISPs are pushing back as part of a wider lobbying effort against encrypted DNS, according to the presentation.\"\n\nSCHUMER, COTTON RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT TIKTOK: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) \u201casked U.S. intelligence officials late Wednesday to determine whether the Chinese-owned social-networking app TikTok poses \u2018national security risks,\u2019\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Tony Romm and Drew Harwell report. \u201cIn a letter to Joseph Maguire, the director of national intelligence, the lawmakers questioned TikTok\u2019s data-collection practices and whether the app adheres to censorship rules directed by the Chinese government that could limit what U.S. users see. TikTok, which provides users a feed of short videos, has become wildly popular among teenagers worldwide.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201c\u2018With over 110 million downloads in the U.S. alone, TikTok is a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore,\u2019 wrote Schumer and Cotton, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\u201d ByteDance, the Chinese conglomerate that owns TikTok, recently established a presence in Washington, hiring Covington & Burling in July to lobby on its behalf. ByteDance, which also has an in-house Washington lobbyist, spent $120,000 on lobbying in the third quarter, according to a disclosure filing.\n\nBALLARD TURNED DOWN WORK TIED TO HIKVISION: Brian Ballard of Ballard Partners talked with The Washington Examiner\u2019s Nihal Krishan, who asked him about the clients he\u2019s turned down. Ballard responded that he decided not to work for a law firm doing work for Hikvision, a Chinese company that\u2019s represented in Washington by Sidley Austin, according to disclosure filings. Ballard also acknowledged lobbying for some clients he wished he hadn\u2019t. \u201cWe've made mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've represented a couple of folks I wish we wouldn't have. I'm not going to tell you who.\u201d\n\nSQUIRE PATTON BOGGS NO LONGER LOBBYING FOR SYRIAN OPPOSITION: Squire Patton Boggs won\u2019t lobby for the High Negotiations Committee of the Syrian Opposition any more, according to a Justice Department filing. A spokesperson for the firm said the account had been dormant for some time, and disclosure filings show the firm hasn\u2019t actively lobbied on the Syrian opposition\u2019s behalf since 2017.\n\nANNALS OF FOREIGN LOBBYING LAW: POLITICO\u2019s Josh Gerstein wonders how worried Rudy Giuliani should be about being charged with failing to register as a foreign lobbyist. After all, a jury acquitted Greg Craig last month of deceiving the DOJ\u2019s Foreign Agents Registration Act unit, and a federal judge tossed out the conviction of Bijan Rafiekian, a former business partner of Michael Flynn, on foreign lobbying charges. \u201c\u2018In the wake of the outcomes in the Greg Craig and Rafiekian cases, the department might engage in additional pressure testing of the evidence in support of a potential FARA charge to maximize the likelihood of a conviction,\u2019 said David Laufman, a former federal prosecutor who stepped down last year as head of the Justice Department section responsible for FARA enforcement.\u201d\n\nREPORT: SHAREHOLDER PRESSURE BEHIND INCREASED CORPORATE TRANSPARENCY ON POLITICS: In their annual scorecard on corporate disclosure of political spending released today, the Center for Political Accountability and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School cited shareholder advocacy as one of the catalysts behind what the groups call an increase in corporate transparency. The report cites AT&T and General Electric, both of which received near-perfect scores, as companies that have responded to shareholder pressure by increasing disclosure of contributions to PACs and fees paid to trade associations, among other expenditures. Still, the average score of S&P 500 companies remains low: 47.1 out of 100.\n\nJobs Report\n\n\u2014 The National Association of Manufacturers is adding Rob Damschen as head of the group\u2019s strategic communications team, effective Monday, POLITICO Pulse reports.
