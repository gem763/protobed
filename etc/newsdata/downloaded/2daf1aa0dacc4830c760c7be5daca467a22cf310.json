The total was the amount he gained through alleged bribes of a senior officer of a Nigerian mint to secure polymer contracts for Securency, the SFO said.\n\nEfforts to reach Mr. Chapman and Securency were unsuccessful on Thursday. Raj Chada, a Hodge Jones & Allen Solicitors Ltd. lawyer who represented Mr. Chapman, didn\u2019t immediately provide a comment. Newsletter Sign-up Securency, at the time jointly owned by Australia\u2019s central bank and U.K. manufacturing firm Innovia Films Ltd., has faced a series of bribery and misconduct allegations since at least May 2009, according to the SFO. Securency allegedly bribed foreign government officials via agents to win contracts with certain governments in Asia and Africa, the SFO said. Mr. Chapman, who was the manager of Securency\u2019s Africa office, was arrested in April 2015 after being extradited from Brazil, the SFO said. He was charged with six offenses in 2015 and convicted of four counts of making corrupt payments to a foreign official in 2016. His appeal was declined by the Court of Appeal in 2017. Mr. Chapman was sentenced in May 2016 to 30 months in prison on each of the four counts, which were to be served concurrently, according to the SFO. He faces additional prison time if the confiscation amount isn\u2019t paid within three months, the SFO said.
