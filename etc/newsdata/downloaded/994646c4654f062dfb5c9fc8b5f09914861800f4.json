It will succeed the iPhone SE, which launched in 2016.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson was not immediately available to comment.\n\nIn a note to investors Sunday, Kuo reiterated that the iPhone SE2 will have a similar design to the iPhone 8. That suggests Apple will be able to reuse parts from that phone while upgrading some of the internal components, like the processor and camera. It will be offered in silver, space gray and red, Kuo said.\n\nKuo also predicted that the budget iPhone will likely attract people who are still using the iPhone 6 and 6s, which he estimates are still being used by as many as 200 million people, even though those phones launched five years ago. He said the new phone will be a \"key growth driver\" for Apple next year.\n\nThe \"iPhone 6 and 6s series are the best-selling iPhone series, and we estimate that around 170\u2013200mn people are still using iPhone 6 and 6s series now,\" Kuo wrote. \"The iPhone 6 series users may have more urgent replacement demand for an upgraded model because iOS 13 doesn't support iPhone 6 series.\"\n\nThe iOS 13 software is Apple's latest iPhone operating system, but it doesn't support the iPhone 6. It was released last month.", "description": "Apple will release the iPhone SE2 early next year for $399, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says.", "authors": ["Todd Haselton"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104726239-12.jpg?v=1506096850", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
