But not all 3-0 starts are created equal, which leaves some doubt about which unbeatens are real and which are fraudulent. After all, Indiana was 3-0 at this point last year, on its way to 5-7.\n\nThe Dash takes a look at 10 unbeatens and appraises their staying power:\n\nCentral Florida (11). Record: 3-0, with wins over Florida A&M, Florida Atlantic and Stanford. Dash rating: Legit.\n\nDoes the sport really need to do this again? To spend most of the season refusing to acknowledge that the Knights are a powerhouse? Apparently so, because UCF being ranked No. 15 in one poll and 16 \u2014 behind the likes of Michigan and Penn State \u2014 is clearly a case of name-brand bias. The Knights absolutely torched Stanford Saturday, lighting up the Cardinal for 38 first-half points behind five scoring drives of at least 62 yards. Doesn\u2019t seem to matter who plays quarterback for UCF \u2014 McKenzie Milton, Darriel Mack, Brandon Wimbush, now freshman Dillon Gabriel \u2014 the offense rolls. Next: at Pittsburgh Saturday.\n\nDo people really still doubt UCF at this point? Especially after clobbering Stanford? (AP)\n\nMinnesota (12). Record: 3-0, with wins over South Dakota State, Fresno State and Georgia Southern. Dash rating: Counterfeit.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Dash got on the Gophers\u2019 rowboat early, predicting an 8-0 record heading into November. That\u2019s still in play, but my goodness P.J. Fleck\u2019s team has been shaky so far. Minnesota trailed the FCS Jackrabbits into the final half of the fourth quarter in the opener; needed a touchdown in the final minute of regulation to force overtime against Fresno State; and scored the game-winning touchdown with 13 seconds left against Georgia Southern. That\u2019s simply not sustainable in Big Ten play \u2014 even in the West Division, which again looks like a tub of live bait. Next: at Purdue Sept. 28.\n\nIowa (13). Record: 3-0, with wins over Miami (Ohio), Rutgers and Iowa State. Dash rating: Legit-ish.\n\nGo ahead and circle Nov. 9 as the day the West is won \u2014 that\u2019s when the Hawkeyes visit Wisconsin. Even with a largely rebuilt defense that lost its top four tacklers from 2018, Iowa is difficult to run against (15th nationally in rush yards allowed) and score against (10th in scoring defense). And after throwing 10 interceptions in an erratic junior season in 2018, quarterback Nate Stanley has yet to throw a pick in \u201919. A plus-five turnover margin on the season to date is a very Kirk Ferentz stat. Next: Middle Tennessee in Iowa City on Sept. 28.\n\nCalifornia (14). Record: 3-0, with wins over UC Davis, Washington and North Texas. Dash rating: Counterfeit.\n\nLook, give abundant credit to coach Justin Wilcox for pushing Cal football forward by remaking it into a physical, defense-first program. In 2016, the last year under Sonny Dykes, the Golden Bears gave up 42.6 points per game. Since then: 28.4 in 2017, 20.4 last year and 16.3 this year. And it\u2019s a great thing to have Washington\u2019s number, upsetting the Huskies this year and last. But if Cal wants to record its first winning Pac-12 record in a decade, it will have to figure out how to score some points. Ranking 99th nationally in total offense and yards per play isn\u2019t going to cut it. Next: at Mississippi.\n\nAre Herm Edwards' Sun Devils good enough to win the Pac-12 South? We're not sure yet. (USA Today)\n\nArizona State (15). Record: 3-0, with wins over Kent State, Sacramento State and Michigan State. Dash rating: Counterfeit-ish.\n\nThe win at Michigan State was a big one, but it also was aided by an unflagged penalty at the end that the Pac-12 acknowledged in a midnight Sunday news dump. Fact is, Arizona State is pretty much Cal of the desert \u2014 very good defensively and probably not good enough offensively to win its division of the Pac-12. The Sun Devils are the only team in the nation that has played three games to allow no more than seven points in every game thus far, which is nice. They\u2019re also 112th nationally in rushing yards per carry, failing thus far to get star junior running back Eno Benjamin untracked. Next: Colorado in Tempe.\n\n(Cal and Arizona State face off Sept. 27 in Tempe, a game that could elevate the winner from counterfeit to legit.)\n\nFlorida (16). Record: 3-0, with wins over Miami, Tennessee-Martin and Kentucky. Dash rating: Semi-legit.\n\nWatching Feleipe Franks\u2019 season end with an ugly injury Saturday night in Lexington was no fun \u2014 but it may have actually gotten Florida\u2019s best quarterback off the bench and into the lineup. Kyle Trask was a revelation in a do-or-die situation, Trailing by two scores, Trask led scoring drives of 62 and 66 yards in the fourth quarter. He finished the game 9 of 13 for 126 yards while also contributing a dazzling option pitchout for a touchdown. If Trask can avoid Franks\u2019 penchant for forehead-slapping turnovers, the Gators may be in good hands. Next: Tennessee in Gainesville.\n\nVirginia (17). Record: 3-0, with wins over Pittsburgh, William & Mary and Florida State. Dash rating: Legit enough to win the Coastal.\n\nTo watch the Cavaliers flail at the end against Florida State Saturday night was like seeing an old friend that hadn\u2019t changed much over the years. A missed extra point that looked like it might be fatal. Then the astonishing defensive conflagration on the Seminoles\u2019 final drive \u2014 four separate 15-yard penalties, enabling a drive that otherwise wasn\u2019t going anywhere. But in the end, the Bronco Mendenhall makeover of Virginia\u2019s historic tendency to self-destruct won out, triggering a field storming. (The catch: Florida State isn\u2019t worth a field storming anymore.) The Cavaliers have a quarterback and a defense, and that may well be enough to win a dismal division. Next: Old Dominion in Charlottesville.\n\nTCU (18). Record: 2-0, with wins over Arkansas-Pine Bluff and Purdue. Dash rating: Insufficient evidence to render a verdict.\n\nThe Horned Frogs have beaten an FCS team and a struggling Purdue team that was playing a freshman backup quarterback. That's not enough to go on yet. The injury to Elijah Sindelar fed right into the hands of defensive mastermind Gary Patterson; Purdue mustered just 204 yards total offense. TCU is characteristically good on that side of the ball and has a formidable one-two running back punch \u2014 but does it have a quarterback? Freshman Max Duggan has been pedestrian thus far, and Kansas State transfer Alex Delton has similarly failed to inspire. The Frogs will need more from that position in the Big 12 shootouts to come. Next: SMU in Fort Worth.\n\nSo far Spencer Sanders and Oklahoma State have looked very on-brand for a Mike Gundy team. (Getty)\n\nOklahoma State (19). Record: 3-0, with wins over Oregon State, McNeese State and Tulsa. Dash rating: Legit.\n\nThis looks like a very on-brand Mike Gundy team: unheralded preseason and now looking like a problem for the rest of the Big 12. Gundy has plugged in his latest productive quarterback \u2014 freshman Spencer Sanders \u2014 and let him distribute the ball to a pair of stud skill position players. Receiver Tylan Wallace (15 catches, 390 yards, six touchdowns) and running back Chuba Hubbard (521 rushing yards, seven TDs) lead the nation in rushing and receiving yards per game. Keep them healthy and the Cowboys will be difficult to stop. Next: at Texas Saturday in an early Big 12 biggie.\n\nAppalachian State (20). Record: 2-0, with wins over East Tennessee State and Charlotte. Dash rating: Legit enough to keep an eye on Saturday.\n\nScott Satterfield left new coach Eliah Drinkwitz a pretty loaded roster, especially on the offensive side of the ball: running back Darrynton Evans, quarterback Zac Thomas, plus a lot of experience at receiver and the offensive line. The App State defense hasn\u2019t been great so far, but it hasn\u2019t needed to be. Next: at North Carolina, in a game where the Tar Heels are on upset alert.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "We appraise the staying power of unbeatens like UCF, Iowa, Arizona State, Florida and six other teams.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jtG8FX_gTjWXASiYdA5yuw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Mqk0oWMC3eye6CB2sQiYqA--~B/aD0yMDQ0O3c9MzA2NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/2dbc59c0-d8a6-11e9-bd95-e0e765202194", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
