More damaging: It cast a shadow over Kurz\u2019s carefully choreographed wholesome image, revealing his lavish spending habits, including a \u20ac600 bill for grooming and a more than \u20ac7,000 private-jet trip to Rome.\n\nThe affair has thrust Klenk, 46, and his newspaper, housed above a pool hall in downtown Vienna, into the center of the campaign for Sunday's election. It has also cast light on the murky connections between Kurz\u2019s party and some of Austria's leading media outlets. Most important, Falter's travails illustrate how even in developed Western European democracies, political parties are successfully using social media and other digital tools to quash or discredit unfavorable stories.\n\nDefending 'the system'\n\nKurz\u2019s People's Party responded to Falter's reporting by claiming the party had been hacked and asserting \u2014 without offering details \u2014 that the accounting data the paper published had been manipulated.\n\nDismissing the affair as \u201cballpointgate,\u201d Kurz, 33, said the real story is the trespasses against his party.\n\n\u201cThere was a targeted attack on the People\u2019s Party servers in order to steal data, manipulate it and then make it public,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cThat\u2019s not just an attack on the People\u2019s Party but an attack on the democratic system.\u201d\n\nFor good measure, the People\u2019s Party sued Falter, seeking a court order to prevent the paper from claiming it had broken the law.\n\nThe People's Party also sowed doubt about the story online, relying on Kurz\u2019s Facebook account, which has more than 800,000 followers, and the party\u2019s small army of social media experts.\n\nThe strategy worked. Within days, instead of chasing down the details of the People\u2019s Party accounting \u2014 which Klenk offered to share with other news outlets \u2014 the media\u2019s focus shifted to the question of who was behind the hack and why.\n\nThe editor of Kurier, one of Austria\u2019s largest newspapers, suggested Klenk was working hand-in-glove with the Social Democrats.\n\nKurz\u2019s party leads by a wide margin, and there\u2019s little question that he will win Sunday's election.\n\nKronen Zeitung, Austria\u2019s best-selling tabloid, went even further. In a 164-word diatribe, columnist Michael Jeann\u00e9e, an ardent backer of Kurz, lambasted Klenk, calling him \u201cunscrupulous\u201d and \u201cpeddler of untruths.\u201d\n\nJeann\u00e9e, who is known as the right-wing tabloid\u2019s hitman (\u201cIf you\u2019re old enough to steal, you\u2019re old enough to die,\u201d he wrote several years ago after Austrian police shot a 14-year-old in the back), then took aim below the belt. The only difference between Klenk and a controversial former Austrian Green party leader, he wrote, is that Klenk hasn\u2019t been accused of sexual misconduct. Klenk responded by suing for defamation.\n\nHello, handsome\n\nGoing by the polls, the affair will not play a big role in voters\u2019 minds when they go to the polls on Sunday.\n\nKurz\u2019s party leads by a wide margin, and there\u2019s little question that he will win. The People\u2019s Party is expected to come first with 34 percent of the vote, according to POLITICO\u2019S Poll of Polls, followed by the Social Democrats with 22 percent and the far-right Austrian Freedom Party with 20 percent.\n\nThough Kurz\u2019s relationship with both of those parties is difficult, there\u2019s a chance he could pursue a coalition with either.\n\nA third option is a so-called Dirndl coalition (named after the colors of the traditional dress). That would be a three-way tie-up with the Greens, who are expected to garner 12 percent of the vote, and the liberal Neos, who are projected to win 8 percent.\n\nAUSTRIA NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nKurz\u2019s last government, an alliance with the Freedom Party, collapsed in May after a video emerged of its then-leader appearing to solicit an illegal campaign donation from a woman in Ibiza he believed to be a wealthy Russian.\n\nFalter was in the middle of that scandal as well, working alongside Germany\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, which released the video together with German weekly Der Spiegel.\n\nFounded in 1977, Falter (German for Butterfly) was long known for its anti-establishment, often subversive take on Austrian society.\n\nFor most if its existence, it was primarily focused on cultural and political commentary. Under Klenk, it has turned more toward hard-nosed investigative journalism.\n\nIn a media landscape that has for decades been dominated by outlets dependent on the largesse of political parties and the state, Falter's unrepentant independence has made it stand out.\n\nIt has come at a price.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything out of the ordinary. What we\u2019re doing is holding up a mirror to what\u2019s out of the ordinary\" \u2014 Florian Klenk, editor of Falter\n\nThough Falter has never been a favorite of Kurz\u2019s People\u2019s Party, its coverage of the conservative bloc in recent years has made it a target.\n\nAfter Kurz was elected in 2017, it put Kurz on its cover with the headline \u201cNeofeschist\u201d (fesch means handsome in German).\n\nThe paper also uncovered a series of scandals in the party and in the Freedom Party. Last year, for example, a leading Freedom Party candidate was forced to step down after the paper revealed that his right-wing fraternity had published a song book with antisemitic lyrics. The paper also uncovered a memo from the leadership of the interior ministry, then controlled by the Freedom Party, ordering Austrian police to avoid giving information to Falter and other critical media.\n\n'Holding up a mirror'\n\nKurz\u2019s government responded to the scrutiny by cutting all government-funded advertising on Falter\u2019s pages, costing the paper about \u20ac500,000 a year.\n\nIt also tried to subvert the paper\u2019s coverage by handing its scoops to other media.\n\nWhen Falter discovered in July that a Kurz associate had secretly shredded a number of hard drives from the chancellery after the coalition fell, party officials handed the story to the Kurier, Klenk said.\n\nDespite those pressures, or maybe because of them, Falter\u2019s following is on the rise.\n\nOver the past decade, its readership has tripled. Though it only sells about 45,000 copies every week and reaches about 3 percent of the population directly, its influence in Austria, a country of nearly 9 million, is considerable because other media, including the dominant public broadcaster, ORF, are forced to chase its scoops.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Klenk, an early adopter of Twitter, has built a considerable following across the German-speaking world. He is also a regular presence on Austrian television. That exposure has made the perpetually unshaven Vienna native something of a media celebrity in the country.\n\nIt\u2019s an unlikely success for the editor of a paper with only about 30 editorial employees, half of whom are freelance.\n\nKlenk said the recent reaction to Falter\u2019s coverage has made him worry about the evolution of Austria\u2019s political culture. He insists the only ideology he and his colleagues are pursuing involves offering good journalism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything out of the ordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is holding up a mirror to what\u2019s out of the ordinary.\u201d", "description": "A series of scoops has thrust Austria\u2019s Falter newspaper into the center of the country\u2019s election campaign.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Jakob Hanke", "Hans Von Der Burchard", "Judith Mischke"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/belgaimage-150188595-full-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
