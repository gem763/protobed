Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.) said that if he was the CEO in this situation, \u201cI would be submitting my letter of resignation to the board of directors because I\u2019m responsible for it, ultimately. \u2026 Have you submitted or offered your letter of resignation to your board of directors?\u201d\n\nMuilenburg said he hadn\u2019t. He said that growing up on the farm, his dad taught him \u201cthat you don\u2019t run away from challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this is a challenging situation. My responsibility is to stick to it and to help our team work through it, and to get Boeing ready for the future,\u201d Muilenburg said. \u201cI feel a keen sense of responsibility to do that, and I\u2019m confident that that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do as a company.\u201d\n\nSeveral lawmakers also focused on Muilenburg being paid more than $23 million in 2018, which included a $13 million bonus, even after the first 737 MAX crash \u2014 an Indonesian Lion Air flight carrying 189 people.\n\nRep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), who chairs the House Transportation Committee before which Muilenburg testified Wednesday, compared a $100 million fund Boeing has set up for families and communities following the crashes to the money Muilenburg himself received.\n\nRep. Peter DeFazio said, \"I haven\u2019t seen convincingly that there have been consequences, except one guy got fired and the leader of the 737 program retired in disgust.\" | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling us there\u2019s been consequences, you\u2019re responsible, and yet these families will get 1 percent of what you get paid, and you talk a lot about your upbringing as a farm boy, I appreciate that,\u201d DeFazio said. \u201cYou\u2019re no longer an Iowa farm boy, you are the CEO of the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, you\u2019re earning a heck of a lot of money, and so far the consequence to you has been, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re not chairman of the board anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen convincingly that there have been consequences, except one guy got fired and the leader of the 737 program retired in disgust because he wouldn\u2019t want to put his family on the airplane,\u201d DeFazio said.\n\nFireworks aside, it\u2019s still unclear what, if anything, lawmakers will ultimately do to change the way the FAA certifies airplanes or the delegation system that allows airplane manufacturers to carry out many certification duties themselves, with FAA oversight.\n\nDemocrats in particular have suggested that some changes to the certification process are a must, but so far it\u2019s an open question about whether Republicans will go along.\n\nBoth DeFazio and Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), the chairman of the House Transportation aviation panel, have suggested that the \u201cdelegation\u201d program needs some changes, including possibly bulking up the FAA\u2019s oversight workforce.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Republicans mostly projected a desire to not act too quickly, and instead wait for the myriad ongoing probes into just what went wrong to return their findings.\n\n\"I\u2019ve said before many times \u2026 if these investigations reveal problems with certification, then I think Congress should act to fix those specific and identifiable problems,\" said Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), who is also a pilot with a commercial rating. \"That\u2019s going to be the issue is identifying what those problems are.\"\n\nAfter the hearing, Muilenburg had to navigate another gauntlet: the family members of crash victims, who had attended the hearing.\n\nNadia Milleron, whose daughter died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, confronted Muilenburg, suggesting he should \"go back to the farm.\"\n\n\"You talked about Iowa just like one too many times,\" Milleron told Muilenburg after the hearing had finished. \"And the whole group said, 'Go back to the farm. Go back to Iowa. Do that.'\"\n\nMilleron continued, saying \"when you make mistakes like that and you can acknowledge them, then maybe someone else should do that work.\"\n\nMuilenburg then reiterated what he had said during the hearing. \"What I learned from my father in Iowa is when things happen on your watch, you have to own it,\" he told Milleron. \"In the end, it's about safety.\"\n\n\"Even if you're not capable of doing that?\" Milleron countered.\n\n\"I respect your inputs there,\" Muilenburg said. \"You have my commitment \u2014 my personal commitment and the commitment of our company \u2014 that we're going to make the safety improvements we need to make and that we're going to prevent accidents like this from happening again.\"\n\n\"Transparency. Thank you,\" Milleron said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c0/7c/8206324e423190da6db6ab884b60/20191030-dennis-boeing-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
