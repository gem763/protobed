Should we now talk about Britain\u2019s darker history? | Kenan Malik", "language": "en", "text": "\u2018I wonder if Kenan Malik is clear that the \u2018Don\u2019t mention the war\u2019 episode of Fawlty Towers is intended to make fun of the British obsession with the Second World War that he criticises?\u201d So wrote an irate John Cleese to the Independent in 1992 in response to an early op-ed of mine on British perceptions of racism in Germany. Yes, I was clear that Cleese had been satirising the British obsession \u2013 and brilliantly \u2013 but my mention of that Fawlty Towers episode was no doubt clumsy enough to draw Cleese\u2019s ire.\n\nI thought about that letter, and that episode of Fawlty Towers, after the infamous Leave.EU tweet last week. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win two world wars to be pushed around by Krauts,\u201d it snorted, in response to Angela Merkel\u2019s supposed demand, in a telephone conversation with Boris Johnson, that Northern Ireland must \u201cforever\u201d stay within the EU customs union.\n\nThirty years ago, that tweet (had Twitter existed) would have seemed unexceptional. Baiting \u201cKrauts\u201d was then a tabloid sport.\n\nLast week, it drew a torrent of criticism and not just from the usual suspects. Even the Brexit party\u2019s Richard Tice was offended. Leave.EU eventually deleted the tweet and apologised (well, sort of).\n\nThere is more than a whiff of hypocrisy about some of this criticism. Tice, after all, was co-founder with Arron Banks of Leave.EU and had no problem with the infamous \u201cbreaking point\u201d poster unveiled by Brexit party leader Nigel Farage. Nevertheless, the kerfuffle over the tweet shows how British attitudes have changed.\n\nNazism remains for most people the touchstone of evil, even if, in an age in which every brutal dictator is a \u201cnew Hitler\u201d and every politician with reactionary views a \u201cfascist\u201d, the term has become so relativised as to be almost meaningless. The Second World War, however, no longer occupies the place it once did in British consciousness.\n\nWhen Basil Fawlty was failing not to mention the war, that war provided for Britain a historical moment of triumph with which to buttress a less-than-triumphant present. Taunting Germany about defeat, whether on the battlefield or the football pitch, became as much a part of being British as complaining about a wet summer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Leave.EU tweet about Angela Merkel. Photograph: Twitter/@arron_banks\n\nBritain\u2019s need to draw on the past to buttress the present is probably more urgent than it was 30 years ago. But, as Leave.EU discovered, anti-German chauvinism no longer provides the resources necessary for the task.\n\nThe irony is that for many people, Germany stands condemned today not for its historic Nazism but for its contemporary liberalism. Angela Merkel\u2019s decision in 2015 to open the borders to migrants and refugees, and its role in helping the growth of the far right, reveals for many the dangers of an overweening liberalism, that, in their eyes, has unleashed darker forces \u2013 witness the attack last week, during Yom Kippur, on a synagogue in the German city of Halle by a far-right gunman. This view of the supposed liberalism of Germany and the EU over immigration is, as I have argued, disturbingly mistaken, as are the claims about the reasons for the rise of the far right. The shift in British perceptions of Germany is nevertheless expressive of the wider recasting of political attachments and faultlines.\n\nBrexit has thrown into turmoil not simply traditional political alignments but also Britain\u2019s understanding of itself and of its place in the world. From debates about \u201cglobal Britain\u201d to worries about the union, the question of what Britain stands for seems less certain. The past has become a battlefield in the struggle to define the present. The bicentenary of the Peterloo massacre in August was, for instance, notable for attempts by both Brexiters and Remainers to claim its legacy as their own, to draw from the 19th-century struggle for democracy lessons for the meaning of democracy today.\n\nThe shifting perceptions of Germany also speak to this contestation over the past. The Second World War has helped anchor Britain\u2019s sense of itself as a nation, not just as the last moment when it could act as a world power but also because the Holocaust provided an unalloyed moral symbol of evil.\n\nIn her book Learning From the Germans, the philosopher Susan Neiman observes that the enormity of the Holocaust has forced Germany to address the darkest aspects of its past. But it has also allowed Britain and America not to do so, to avoid thinking too deeply about the history of slavery or of empire, to minimise their horrors in comparison with the Holocaust.\n\nThe turmoil over Brexit is throwing many of the old certainties into question. The question is \u2013 will we use that uncertainty to have a grown-up debate about history and identity?\n\n\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist", "description": "The backlash against Leave.EU\u2019s revolting tweet reveals our growing maturity", "authors": ["Kenan Malik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b9d65422efc9f6eb1c979d1a8adedfbb94379f7/158_0_4684_2812/master/4684.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=62f234d7824eb16bec80180df9764f72", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
