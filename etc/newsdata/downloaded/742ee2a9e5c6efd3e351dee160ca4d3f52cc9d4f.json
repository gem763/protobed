The Whatsapp group phased out and we just all left it and got on with the show. There was a lot of big personalities so I think it was best not to have a group in general.\u2019\n\nThere are a lot of big personalities on the show (Picture: Ray Burmiston\n\nBBC/Boundless)\n\nOn Wednesday night\u2019s episode, the budding entrepreneurs were split into groups as they visited the historic university cities of Oxford and Cambridge to procure nine items that are associated with both places \u2013 and I think it\u2019s safe to say that both teams found the task a bit tricky (because they didn\u2019t know what all of the items were).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe events manager from London was the fifth candidate to leave, and despite being \u2018gutted\u2019 Riyonn said the entire experience was fun \u2013 but some scenes were edited out.\n\nHe laughed: \u2018They did show a few of my dumb moments, but that\u2019s just me without my phone, but I wasn\u2019t worried about the edit as I came across as who I am.\n\n\u2018When we did the safari, we did a tour with all the animals and I had no idea what the animals were so I thought \u201cthat\u2019s going to make me look great on TV isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u2018\n\nLottie Lion (Picture: BBC)\n\nThe 30-year-old admitted that the boardroom goes on for a full day so, in actual fact, a lot of it is cut from the show.\n\nLast week Lubna Farhan was fired, and since leaving the show she revealed that her boardroom scene was cut completely.\n\nRiyonn also went on to reveal that he felt several of the candidates \u2018played up to the camera\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018A lot does get edited from the show but I am not worried as I feel like I left with my head held high.\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t say anyone in particular but on and off camera with certain characters there is a big difference and as soon as the cameras roll they are 100% more amped up than normal and I would say \u201cguys why don\u2019t you just be yourself, why do you have to be different on camera?\u201d but I guess that\u2019s how they wanted to play it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think that\u2019s why it was more frustrating because they came across as good, but then off-camera they weren\u2019t that way in person.\u2019\n\nThe Apprentice continues Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
