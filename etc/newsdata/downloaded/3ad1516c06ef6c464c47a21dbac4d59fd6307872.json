And within the party there is growing frustration that Steyer\u2019s time, efforts and resources would be better spent further bankrolling the pro-impeachment project he started years ago than in a long-shot presidential campaign that many view as a vanity project.\n\n\u201cIt just shows he doesn\u2019t believe in anything other than trying to buy the presidency,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, public affairs director at Democracy Forward and a pro-impeachment advocate.\n\nWhile Need to Impeach is now jumping into the impeachment ad wars, it is already playing catch-up. The group spent just $5,309 on Facebook ads this past week, according to the social media site\u2019s online database. By contrast, Steyer\u2019s presidential campaign has spent $382,783 during that time frame. Both Trump and the RNC spent more than $2.1 million on Facebook ads during that same time period, about a quarter of which was devoted to hitting the impeachment issue.\n\nTom Steyer Says He Can\u2019t Disclose Hundreds of Millions in Financial Assets\n\nAlberto Lammers, Steyer\u2019s campaign spokesman, scoffed at criticism that Steyer wasn\u2019t doing enough, saying that the current landscape around impeachment actually vindicated his boss\u2019 decision to enter the presidential race.\n\n\u201cHe is partially responsible for getting the House there before this whole thing broke,\u201d he said, noting that Need to Impeach had more than 8.3 million members on its email list. \u201cHe started Need to Impeach against the wishes of the leaders of the Democratic Party because he knew it was the right thing to do and now it is all coming to fruition. And the things he has done with impeachment he can do elsewhere: getting the corporate corruption out of politics and acting on climate change and health care immediately.\u201d\n\nBut the ad spending disparities has prompted renewed criticisms within some corners of the party about the merits and value of Steyer\u2019s presidential bid and it has led to more dire warnings that Dems may fumble a historically significant moment.\n\n\u201cThe inequality in online ad spending between Trump allies and Dems is a potential crisis,\u201d warned Zac Petkanas, a party strategist and former aide to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nSteyer\u2019s presidential campaign advertising has not been entirely without a pro-impeachment push. Indeed, the issue has been featured in some of his spots, including a recent television ad his campaign aired on Fox & Friends. And a campaign spokesman said that they are currently readying a new digital and television ad on impeachment that will be unveiled over the coming days.\n\nBut the main focus of the campaign\u2019s ad blitz remains on bolstering his long-shot presidential effort. Of the 65 ads he is currently running on Facebook, 49 focus on items other than impeachment, and many of the spots he has run on television have been geared towards early state voters and not a national audience writ large. The ad that they are set to launch, for example, will be shown only in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.\n\nCompared to other entities, however, Steyer\u2019s network of organizations is actually making robust investments in the pro-impeachment ad campaigns. Almost all of the online ad spending being placed by presidential campaigns is on their own election efforts. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), has emphasized that she was one of the first presidential candidates to call for impeachment. But of the hundreds of current ads she is running on Facebook, just 16 are devoted to that topic, according to an analysis of Facebook\u2019s database.\n\nAnd Priorities USA, the Democratic Party\u2019s top super PAC, said it has no plans to adjust its current 2020 ad campaign strategy in response to the launch of impeachment proceedings and the Trump campaign\u2019s investments.", "description": "Saul Loeb/GettyAs impeachment proceedings begin in haste in Congress, Democrats find themselves at a severe financial disadvantage when it comes to swaying public opinion online and on the airwaves.\u00a0On Tuesday, the group Need to Impeach, which is funded mainly by billionaire Democratic presidential candidate", "authors": ["Sam Stein", "Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gb5BHFWd1z3CYH9pbrIYPQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/fd20b26ae6341e8ebec3587aedb3bcce"}
