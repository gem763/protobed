The film, based on journalist Jessica Pressler\u2019s 2015 investigative New York magazine piece, \u201cThe Hustlers at Scores,\u201d stars Constance Wu as Destiny, a new dancer struggling to pay rent for the apartment where she cares for her grandmother\u2014until she meets Ramona, played by Jennifer Lopez. Ramona is a single mom and the most successful dancer at the club\u2014but this changes with the market crash of 2008. When the recession hits, Ramona enlists fellow down-and-out dancers Destiny, Mercedes (Keke Palmer) and Annabelle (Lili Reinhart) to help her swindle men into spending big on a night out, with the men forgetting most of the previous night\u2019s transactions come morning because their drinks were laced with ketamine and MDMA. The film\u2019s cast is rounded out by Cardi B, Lizzo and Julia Stiles, who plays a reporter modeled after Pressler.\n\nWhile some opening weekend attendees might be in it for the salaciousness that a \u201cstripper movie\u201d promises (it certainly does deliver on that front), the heart of Hustlers isn\u2019t so different from any other gang film. The women at the center of the film are bound together by the need for something greater than what they had to begin with, and the wish to make their dreams for themselves and their families a reality by any means necessary. WSJ. spoke with Wu, Palmer and Reinhart at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills to talk about working on their own version of Goodfellas, and what men really want from movies.\n\nHollywood depictions of sex workers don\u2019t generally give women much agency. Was it important to you that Hustlers empowered them?\n\nKeke Palmer: I liked that it was balanced because it either goes one of two ways. Either it\u2019s like super, super sad, sad, sad or overly glamorized. When I read this, I felt like it was a balance of both. You had those moments where you thought it might be glamorous and you had those moments like, \u201cDamn, this sh*t is tough.\u201d And so whenever I\u2019m looking at a character or a movie\u2014no matter what the job, no matter who these people are\u2014I want to see balance. This movie gave me that.\n\nConstance Wu: Usually we see one archetype of a woman who is a sex worker or a stripper. And yes, we have racial diversity, but we had diversity in so many other ways\u2014the way you look, the backgrounds of these women and also the different ways that they decided to pursue this job, to make their ends meet.\n\nLili Reinhart: We all came from such different backgrounds and we all ended up in the same job. So it\u2019s not just this archetype \u2014\u201cOh, trashy girl from a broken home ends up being a stripper.\u201d That\u2019s such a stereotype. That\u2019s not the case. Women are supporting their children, or supporting themselves or their families, or their families kicked them out. I think strippers will hopefully enjoy our film.\n\nCW: I hope so. Because we tried to humanize them as people. Other movies don\u2019t\u2014they try to portray them as objects or people to move the plot along for the story. We treated all of our characters like humans who have a similar job. That\u2019s only one part of you, your job.\n\nHow did the all-female ensemble cast change the vibe on set?\n\nCW: I think it was really freeing. Because it\u2019s different if there\u2019s only one spot for a woman. And then you think, \u201cOh no\u2014what if I get kicked off?\u201d But when it\u2019s all women, I didn\u2019t have to try to be sexy for guys. I didn\u2019t have to try to pretend like, \u201cOh I\u2019m one of the guys, I\u2019m cool.\u201d I just got to be myself. And [Jennifer Lopez] set the tone for that pretty well, too, because she\u2019s just so cool.\n\nLR: I\u2019m so happy that this is a movie about women told by a woman, because nothing disturbs me more than a woman\u2019s story told by a man, because it\u2019s through the filter of a man. And so the fact that this was a women\u2019s story told, written and seen through the lens of a woman was powerful.\n\nKP: One of the first things that [Constance] said was, \u201cIt\u2019s like a female Goodfellas,\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cdamn right!\u201d Lorene was really serious with the DP on getting those specific shots, those specific angles that you only see men have. It was just like, \u201cMan, girl, thank you for those details. Not only does the script have heart and soul, but visually you\u2019re going for this, you\u2019re giving us a cinematic look. You\u2019re making these women look cool!\u201d That was all specific to show us in powerful positions.\n\nLR: Not even sexy, but powerful. It\u2019s not a slow-motion strut starting from the heels going up, showing the body. It\u2019s the women themselves.\n\nKP: It\u2019s how they would usually do the Wall Street guys. It\u2019s power.\n\nCW: Like sometimes people say \u201cOh, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s film,\u201d they\u2019ll think that it\u2019s less-than. But I think Lorene did a really good job of choosing a crew who treated the film with the respect of something they were really passionate about, not as like\u2014\n\nKP: \u201cGirl movie.\u201d\n\nCW: Yeah, I mean there\u2019s that term that people like to say: \u201cChick flick.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, does that mean every other movie in the world is a d*ck flick?\u201d But that\u2019s just a word used\u2014chick flick\u2014to demean a movie that is about women, and then d*ck flicks are just \u201cflicks.\u201d\n\nLR: Just movies in general.\n\nHow is a story where you\u2019re playing out, essentially, a love story with another woman different from one with a man?\n\nKP: It hurt my feelings more when all that stuff went down with Constance\u2019s character and Jennifer\u2019s character.\n\nLR: It\u2019s more devastating.\n\nKP: Way more devastating. I feel like people aren\u2019t going to be pleasantly surprised to see the depth and dynamic of these characters and [that] this story is not just something eye-catching for you like, \u201cStripping! Fun!\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cOh wow, these characters, I care about them. I care about this story.\u201d\n\nCW: It almost hurts more than a romantic thing because it almost feels more pure of a love, because there\u2019s not the transaction of sex. The feeling of being forgiven\u2014it\u2019s a good feeling because it\u2019s accepting that we all mess up, and that we\u2019re still people who are worthy of love. And Jen\u2014I couldn\u2019t have done any of this without [her]. That was really just a two-way street; just the fact that she was so open and caring.\n\nWas there anything challenging for you to do in the film?\n\nKP: I think every girl secretly in their mind is ready to get on stage and see if they\u2019ve got what it takes. I think most people would expect [dancing] to be the most challenging. But I think even the shyest person, if they had the opportunity to play a role like this or be in a situation like this\u2014it\u2019s like \u201cHell, if I\u2019m going to do it somewhere, I might as well do it in a huge film.\u201d I think those parts were exciting. It could be seen as challenging, but what I was excited about was to sit in this sexy place that I\u2019ve never really sat in before. I don\u2019t really think of myself as a sexy type of chick. And so it was cool to play with what that would look like for the camera.\n\nLR: I feel like deep inside, every woman feels the need to get on a pole at least once. I think you grow up and you\u2019re like \u201cOh, that\u2019s what sexy is.\u201d And you just want to try it. And truly, [to Constance] I\u2019m sure you took probably more pole dancing lessons than I did, but it was just fun. And you\u2019re like, \u201cDamn, I look good!\u201d\n\nCW: I was just thinking when you said like every woman wants to get on the pole\u2014at first I was like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d But then I was like thinking about it, and why that might be true. And if you think about it, these women are owning their sexuality, which is something we are shamed for, starting at puberty, we\u2019re supposed to make ourselves\u2014you either have to be the Madonna or the whore, and you can\u2019t win either way. You\u2019re not sexy enough; you\u2019re too sexy. And I think when you\u2019re on a stage and you\u2019re dancing and you\u2019re just owning your sexiness in the way that you want to do it, I think that is a thing that inside probably every woman\u2014person\u2014wants to do.\n\nDo you think anyone who goes to see the film solely for the \u201cstripper movie!\u201d factor will be disappointed?\n\nKP: Look, Jennifer gave you the show that you\u2019re looking for right in the beginning. She gives you what we never thought we\u2019d see. She gave us the most spectacular performance that I have ever seen a stripper do. I\u2019ve gone to a lot of strip clubs.\n\nCW: Me too. And I\u2019m going to say something real cheesy right now, but I do believe it\u2019s true: People might say they\u2019re looking for t*ts, but I think they\u2019re looking for heart. And they\u2019re just saying tits because it\u2019s a less vulnerable thing to need, to say. It\u2019s cooler and more macho to objectify women. But at the end of the day, all humans want\u2014\n\nLR: They relate to stories about love.\n\nCW: \u2014is connection.\n\nKP: Without a doubt. Every guy that I\u2019ve watched The Notebook with has loved it.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "description": "Constance Wu, Keke Palmer and Lili Reinhart discuss playing exotic dancers and getting rid of the \u201cchick flick\u201d label.", "authors": ["Trish Bendix"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105130/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
