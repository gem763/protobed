But the only way to break the Brexit deadlock once and for all is a public vote in a referendum. A general election might well fail to solve this Brexit chaos.\u201d\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer will leave no doubt that Labour is gearing up for an imminent election when he tells the TUC Congress on Wednesday that the party will be \u201cready\u201d to go to the country soon after parliament returns from its suspension on 14 October.\n\n\u201cWe have to stop no deal,\u201d Sir Keir will say. \u201cLast week we beat them in parliament, but very soon we will have to beat them at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nSir Keir will also say he expects Brexit to be a \u201ccrucial\u201d issue at the election and confirmed that Labour believes a referendum with Remain on the ballot paper is the only way to \u201cbreak the deadlock and clean up the mess left by the Tories\u201d.\n\nBut there were warnings from the backbenches that an election before Brexit is settled could be fatal for Labour.\n\nOne senior MP who backs a Brexit deal said: \u201cIt\u2019s an existential issue for us. If Brexit is still in play at the election we could be wiped out in the midlands and the north, losing anything up to 80 seats. And if there is no clarity about what we stand for it will only be worse.\u201d\n\nFormer prime minister Tony Blair also urged caution over an early election, warning it would may well result in another hung parliament which fails to establish the public\u2019s preferences on Brexit.\n\n\u201cIf parliament is blocked over Brexit and to deblock it you need to go back to the people, go back to the people on the issue of Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGo back and ask them whether they want the government\u2019s proposition or whether they want to stay. That\u2019s the obvious way out of this.\u201d\n\nArguing for a fresh public vote, Mr Watson will say that, after more than three years, the 2016 referendum result is \u201cno longer a valid basis on which to take such a momentous decision about the future of the United Kingdom\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe only proper way to proceed in such circumstances is to consult the people again,\u201d he will say.\n\nIf a general election comes first, \u201cwe must unambiguously and unequivocally back remain ... not for electoral or tactical reasons, but because it is the right thing to do for the country at this time of greatest crisis since the Second World War\u201d.\n\nJames Cleverly, the Conservative chairman, said it was clear that Labour \u201cwant to cancel the referendum result\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis latest trick would mean delaying Brexit again for up to a year, handing over \u00a3250m a week to Brussels for no purpose,\u201d said Mr Cleverly. \u201cLabour are running scared of an election and only offer more dither and pointless delay.\u201d", "description": "Labour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson will call for the party to demand a second Brexit referendum\u00a0and it must take place before a general election, in a fresh clash with Jeremy Corbyn.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock", "Lizzy Buchan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/16/17/tom-watson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
