I worked for George W. Bush. And I\u2019m asking you to vote Trump out.", "language": "en", "text": "Less than seven years later, while Trump fixes Latinos in his crosshairs, GOP leaders stick their heads in the sand, complicit by their cowardice. Worse than saying nothing or tolerating his tantrums, some even protect Trump, colluding with the devil for fear of political demise.\n\nAnd now, they have blood on their hands. The Walmart shooting in El Paso on Aug. 3 was the inevitable outcome of 30 straight months of hate speech coming from the White House. Fueled by the president\u2019s vitriol, a killer sought out immigrants to slaughter. The shooting isn\u2019t just a tragedy; it\u2019s a massacre, a direct hit against our community. Do not imagine we do not all feel the consequences. I have a friend who lives in Austin. She says she no longer feels comfortable going to a store to purchase diapers for her child.\n\nRepublicans will pay a price for this situation and for their silence. By the 2020 election, Hispanics will be the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the electorate \u2014 32 million will be eligible to vote. At the same time, 1 in 10 eligible voters will be Generation Z, those between the ages 18 and 23, who are socially liberal and more racially and ethnically diverse.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abel Guerra", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Im-Latino-I-Worked-For-George-W-Bush-And-Im-Asking-You-To-Vote-Trump-Out"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
