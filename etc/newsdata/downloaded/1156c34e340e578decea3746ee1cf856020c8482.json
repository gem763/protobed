Anthony Brindisi voiced his frustrations directly to Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe battleground freshman told Pelosi and other leaders at a closed-door meeting that he and other centrists feared that talk of impeaching President Donald Trump was threatening to swamp the Democratic agenda, according to multiple people in the room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating for me \u2014 someone coming from a district that was one of the districts that helped get us into the majority \u2014 having so much focus on things like impeachment or other issues that are divisive,\u201d Brindisi said in an interview, adding that he\u2019s been talking to fellow swing-district freshmen who have similar concerns with the fall agenda. \u201cWe should be focusing on the kitchen table issues.\u201d\n\nIn the same meeting, another moderate in the room, Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), pointed to alarming polling from the Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, which showed that voters think the party is \u201cprioritizing impeachment over other issues,\u201d according to an internal summary obtained by POLITICO.\n\nPelosi responded by saying she was keenly aware of their concerns, and reiterated that the caucus does not have 218 votes for impeachment. And she stressed that only the full House has the power to launch proceedings \u2014 a statement that seems to conflict with the Judiciary Committee\u2019s position that it is currently engaged in an impeachment investigation.\n\nThe comments by Brindisi and Murphy are the latest sign of the mounting frustration among the Democratic caucus\u2019 small, but mighty, moderate wing. Since returning from the summer break, centrist Democrats have been venting \u2014 to each other and directly to Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler \u2014 about what they fear the public sees as a fixation on impeachment that could undermine their reelection prospects in 2020, multiple lawmakers and aides said.\n\nPelosi\u2019s efforts to tamp down talk of impeachment, expressed in private and in public, so far haven\u2019t appeased the caucus\u2019 centrist wing.\n\nAnother vulnerable freshman, Rep. Max Rose, gave the same warnings about impeachment in a private meeting with Nadler. A few days later, Rose unleashed his frustrations publicly with an op-ed in his hometown paper, cautioning that Democrats are \u201cin danger of losing the trust of the American people\u201d with its unrelenting focus on Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing what I think is the right thing to do,\u201d Rose said in an interview, adding that no single incident propelled him to write the op-ed. \u201cI want to see this party \u2014 and I know it has it in it \u2014 get to work passing substantive infrastructure and health care bills by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThe centrists\u2019 aversion to impeachment, however, is just as strong as progressives\u2019 insistence that failing to impeach Trump would be a dereliction of duty \u2014 a direct clash that will only further divide the caucus and test Democratic leaders through the 2020 election.\n\nRep.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told reporters last week. \u201cI want to see every Republican go on the record and knowingly vote against impeachment of this president, knowing his corruption, having it on the record so that they can have that stain on their careers for the rest of their lives.\u201d", "description": "Vulnerable House Democrats fear the party's drive toward impeachment will undercut them in 2020.", "authors": ["Sarah Ferris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3olek9VOh2CvsWnBhKYUsQ--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/6117e47d5c165c625087305d0af9da36", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
