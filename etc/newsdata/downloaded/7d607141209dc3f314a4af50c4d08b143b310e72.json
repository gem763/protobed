It can lead to strokes and heart attacks.\n\nThis is because the blood vessels, heart, and organs are put under more strain. Even small reductions in blood pressure can slash the risk.\n\nWHAT IS HYPERTENSION? High blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes. The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked. Blood pressure is recorded with two numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body. The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels. They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg). As a general guide: high blood pressure is considered to be 140/90mmHg or higher\n\nideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg\n\nlow blood pressure is considered to be 90/60mmHg or lower\n\nA blood pressure reading between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you don't take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.

It directly caused almost 1,000 deaths every day in 2013.\n\nMore than one in four adults in the UK have high blood pressure, according to the NHS, although many won't be aware of it.\n\nIt was responsible to 75,000 deaths in the UK in 2015, according to the Global Burden of Disease report.", "description": "Scientists at University of Oxford pooled data from studies between 1994 and 2018.
