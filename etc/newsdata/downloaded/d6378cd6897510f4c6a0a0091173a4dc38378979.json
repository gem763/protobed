Walmart Inc. is launching right into Christmas, unveiling online holiday deals at midnight Eastern Time Friday, Oct. 25.\n\nThis \u201cEarly Deals Drop\u201d will be available online, with stores making the conversion to Christmas after Halloween, which is next Thursday.\n\nSteve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer for Walmart U.S., said it was the earliest start ever, noting the shorter shopping season on a call with media.\n\nThis year will have six fewer shopping days, and both Walmart WMT, -0.19% and Target Corp. TGT, -1.62% are looking to maximize every moment.\n\nSee: Amazon earnings preview: One-day shipping and AWS slowdown could squeeze results\n\n\u201cSaving our customers time is also paramount at this time of year, especially with fewer days to get ready for big family meals, parties and gift giving,\u201d Bratspies said.\n\nTarget is also thinking about the shortened season, and is focused on convenience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very compressed holiday season,\u201d Chief Executive Brian Cornell said during a media event to launch the retailer\u2019s holiday season plan. \u201cIf you\u2019re in retail, every day counts.\u201d\n\nCornell said Wednesday that the holiday deals calendar is still to come, but the retailer isn\u2019t waiting too long after Halloween to start spreading the Christmas cheer.\n\n\u201cThe trees are on their way to the stores,\u201d Cornell said.\n\nRead: Hasbro says tariffs are to blame for earnings miss\n\nRetailers are focused on convenience, and getting gifts into shoppers\u2019 hands as quickly and easily as possible.\n\nWalmart highlights all of the digitally-enabled ways to shop this year with offerings like Gift Finder, a new platform that helps shoppers choose a gift based on things like price range, and a scannable toy catalog, available Nov. 1, available for use on iOS devices.\n\nTarget is also focused online, with the retailer\u2019s e-commerce site offering same-day delivery with Shipt and, soon, via the Target app; Drive Up pick-up service offered on the app, and free shipping on hundreds of thousands of items starting Nov. 1 through Dec. 21.\n\nTarget is also ramping up in-store service, adding nearly $50 million in payroll year-over-year to be sure that stores are staffed at the busiest times. Cornell said this is the biggest investment ever in holiday payroll.\n\nTarget\u2019s payroll investment is in keeping with the findings of a recent Coresight Research report, which found that hiring could decline slightly compared to last year, but wages will go up.\n\n\u201cAmidst an uncertain economic environment, mass store closures and the associated structural shifts moving away from legacy retail formats, seasonal hiring is expected to be stagnant or fall slightly from last year,\u201d the report said. \u201cTo attract more seasonal workers, retailers are offering higher hourly wages and perks.\u201d\n\nAlso: China casts long shadow over stocks as earnings season opens\n\nBest Buy Co Inc.

Target found during an 18-month test period that shoppers enrolled in the program spent 2% to 5% more.\n\nThose shoppers will start seeing Kids Daily Deals on Nov. 1 through Nov. 27.\n\nWalmart stock is up 27.6% for the year to date.
