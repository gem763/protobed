Meet Austin's top VCs, giving Silicon Valley investors a run for the money.", "language": "en", "text": "Austin, Texas, has long been a hub for sales and customer service outposts for some of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies.\n\nIn recent years, the city has seen a revival of entrepreneurship, and with it, venture capital.\n\nThe city's ecosystem was long dominated by Austin Ventures, a major venture capital firm with significant influence over Silicon Valley's traditional VC firms.\n\nSeveral Austin Ventures alumni left to start their own firms, which has helped breed healthy competition among investors to the benefit of founders across many industries.\n\nHere are some of Austin's most notable venture capital firms.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nAustin has yet to land an outpost of popular fitness studio Barry's Bootcamp, but that hasn't stopped venture capital from creeping into the Texas capital.\n\nOnce a long-time sales hub, Austin is just as awash in entrepreneurs and venture capital dollars as it is in slow-smoked barbecue and live music venues.

It was a lose-lose situation, and Austin's startup scene suffered.\n\n\"Austin has changed quite a bit relative to the VC ecosystem that's existed here\" Silverton Partners general manager Kip McClanahan told Business Insider. \"Back in the day, Austin Ventures [was] kind of like the only shop that existed,\" he explains. \"It was sort of a traditional old school firm, raised very large funds and larger funds and over time, fell out of favor.\"\n\nToday, Austin Ventures is mostly focused on private equity investing, leaving the venture capital opportunities wide open.
