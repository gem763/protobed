General Assembly, the U.S. State Department accused the two Cuban diplomats of trying to \u201cconduct influence operations\u201d harmful to U.S. national security but did not elaborate on the accusations or release their names.\n\nIt was the latest sign of deteriorating U.S. relations with communist-ruled Cuba, focusing especially on Havana\u2019s support for Venezuela\u2019s socialist President Nicolas Maduro, since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.\n\n\u201cThe Department of State today notified the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the United States requires the imminent departure of two members of Cuba\u2019s Permanent Mission to the United Nations for abusing their privileges of residence,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in statement.\n\n\u201cThis is due to their attempts to conduct influence operations against the United States,\u201d she said.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez rejected the U.S. actions as \u201cunjustified,\u201d saying on Twitter: \u201cThe imputation that they might have carried out actions incompatible with their diplomatic status is a vulgar slander.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe expulsion ... has the aim of provoking a diplomatic spiral that would lead to the closure of bilateral embassies, further tightening of the (U.S.) blockade and creation of tensions between both countries,\u201d he said.\n\nOrtagus said the movements of other members of the Cuban delegation would \u201cessentially\u201d be limited to the island of Manhattan.\n\n\u201cWe take any and all attempts against the national security of the United States seriously, and will continue to investigate any additional personnel who may be manipulating their privileges of residence.\u201d\n\nUnder the 1947 U.N. \u201cheadquarters agreement,\u201d the United States is generally required to allow access to the United Nations for foreign diplomats. But Washington says it can deny visas for \u201csecurity, terrorism, and foreign policy\u201d reasons, though this provision is only invoked on a limited basis.\n\nOver the decades, Washington and Havana, old Cold War foes, have engaged in tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats.\n\nThe Trump administration expelled 15 Cuban diplomats in September 2017 after sharply drawing down U.S. embassy staff in Havana over a mysterious affliction that Washington said had affected American personnel there.\n\nThe Republican president has imposed new economic sanctions on Cuba and restricted travel to the island, steadily rolling back parts of the historic opening under his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nWashington has made clear that a key objective of its pressure campaign is to force Cuba to abandon Maduro, something Havana has said it will never do. Trump, however, has stopped short of breaking off diplomatic relations with Cuba restored by Obama in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility.", "description": "The Trump administration on Thursday ordered the expulsion from the United States of two members of Cuba's delegation to the United Nations and restricted travel of the remaining mission members to Manhattan, drawing strong condemnation from Havana.", "authors": ["Matt Spetalnick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
