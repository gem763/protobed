The nature of the new charges remains unclear.\n\nThe 51-year-old actor, who faces a maximum penalty of one year in jail if convicted, has vehemently denied the sexual-misconduct allegations.\n\nDressed in a navy pinstripe suit with a white pocket square, the Jerry Maguire star remained quiet during his brief court appearance as Manhattan prosecutors revealed to Judge Marisol Martinez Alonso that new charges were filed Tuesday night in connection to \u201canother incident\u201d that is \u201coutside the Manhattan Criminal Court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d The revelation garnered murmurs throughout the courtroom.\n\nThe actor has been \u201cindicted on charges included in this docket as well as an additional incident previously uncharged,\u201d Assistant District Attorney Jenna Long said Thursday.\n\nBoth Gooding\u2019s lawyers and prosecutors agreed to an arraignment on the new charges in Manhattan Supreme Court next Tuesday. The indictment will not be unsealed until then, prosecutors said.\n\nGooding\u2019s trial was already postponed in September after prosecutors said they were still waiting for evidence in the star\u2019s case. On Thursday, the actor and his lawyers quickly left the courthouse without remarking on the new allegations.\n\nProsecutors previously alleged a 29-year-old woman, who has not been identified, told authorities she was at Magic Hour Rooftop Bar & Lounge in Times Square on June 9 with friends when she noticed the actor. The woman told authorities Gooding was \u201cheavily intoxicated,\u201d so she offered him a cup of water.\n\nWhile the two were in the midst of a conversation, the woman alleges Gooding groped her breasts, at which point they got into an \u201cargument.\u201d The woman told police she left the bar and immediately called 911.\n\nAlthough Gooding was no longer on the scene when authorities arrived, police were able to confirm his presence at Magic Hour with bar staff and video surveillance footage. Shortly after the actor was arrested, TMZ published surveillance footage allegedly showing the incident.\n\nAt the time of Gooding\u2019s arrest, police said they were investigating a second allegation from a woman who said she was groped by the actor over a decade ago. Authorities said the woman, who has not been identified, initially came forward after seeing news reports about the June incident.\n\nThe second woman reportedly accused the The People v. O.J. Simpson star of grabbing her butt in 2008 at Butter Restaurant in Manhattan, the New York Daily News reported. New York, however, has a five-year statute of limitations on these types of sexual assaults so it was not immediately clear whether the actor is being charged for these allegations.\n\nGooding\u2019s defense attorney, Mark J. Heller, has previously denied the allegations to The Daily Beast, saying the \u201calmost two hours of tape\u201d reviewed by his team and authorities prove there is no criminal behavior.\n\n\u201cWe have reviewed the tapes, and we do not see any criminal conduct having been perpetrated on his part,\u201d Heller said. \u201cHe respects women. I\u2019ve known him for over 30 years, this is not something he would do.\u201d\n\nHeller did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s requests for comment on the latest allegations Thursday.", "description": "Prosecutors announced new charges related to \u201can additional incident\u201d as the \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d star arrived in court for the start of his groping trial.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1878,w_3340,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570719518/GettyImages-1174969076_joav4k", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
