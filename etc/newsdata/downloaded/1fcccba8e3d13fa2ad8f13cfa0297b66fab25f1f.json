The bloc put off a decision until after British politicians vote Monday on Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal for an early general election.\n\nIn a pooled interview, Johnson contradicted comments by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid that the U.K. will not meet the prime minister\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to leave the EU on Oct. 31. The premier said the U.K. could and should leave by the current deadline.\n\nKey Developments:\n\n\n\nEU agrees in principle to extension but aims to make decision on length by Tuesday. France is alone in rejecting three-month delayJohnson proposes Dec. 12 for general election, but needs two-thirds majority in Parliament for it to take place; vote scheduled for Monday in the House of CommonsOpposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says threat of no-deal Brexit must be removed before he\u2019ll back a snap pollPound falls 0.2%\n\n\n\nElection Vote Going Ahead, Official Says (1:15 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson plans to press ahead with a vote on an election on Monday regardless of whether the EU has replied to his request for a delay -- and even if Labour says it will oppose the motion, a senior government official said.\n\nThe government wouldn\u2019t bring back its Brexit legislation if it loses the vote, even if Parliament agreed to a strict timetable to debate it, the official said. That\u2019s because of the risk that Members of Parliament will either seek to delay its progress further or attach amendments meaning the government has to reopen negotiations with Brussels, the person said.\n\nJohnson: Corbyn, EU, Parliament Key to Next Steps (1 p.m.)\n\nIn a pooled interview to broadcasters, Boris Johnson doubled down on his remarks from Thursday: he\u2019ll only give members of Parliament more time to debate his Brexit legislation if they agree to an election on Dec. 12. Johnson also said his government would continue to push its domestic agenda.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t do is engage in pointless Brexitology in Parliament, when Parliament is simply committed to delay\u201d the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, Johnson said.\n\nThe premier also called on opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to \u201cman up\u201d and face the electorate. He said it\u2019s still possible for the U.K. to leave the European Union on schedule on Oct. 31, contradicting remarks earlier by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid. But Johnson said it\u2019s up to the EU.\n\nFrance Stands Alone Over Extension (12:30 p.m.)\n\nFrance was the only country which didn\u2019t support granting a Brexit extension to the end of January at Friday\u2019s meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels, according to two diplomats familiar with the discussions. France wanted the bloc to grant an initial extension to Nov. 30 at the latest, they said.\n\nFrance\u2019s position is that granting an extension that is too long would take the pressure off British politicians to ratify the divorce agreement, one of the diplomats said. An EU summit to discuss the length of extension may become unavoidable if France continues to oppose an extension to the end of January, the second diplomat said.\n\nEarlier, the EU said it wanted a decision made without a summit. A spokesman for the French government in Brussels didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEU Non-Decision Meant to Put Onus on MPs (12:15 p.m.)\n\nBy deferring its decision to delay Brexit, the European Union is still holding out hope that it can pressure U.K. Members of Parliament to back the divorce deal in the next week or so. That, along with the contradictory impulse of not wanting to be seen interfering in British politics, means diplomats have given themselves to Tuesday to reach a conclusion.\n\nThey know that by then, Parliament will have held a vote on whether to hold an election and the picture about what happens next might be clearer. The EU doesn\u2019t want to convene a summit to sort this out, though it hasn\u2019t completely ruled this out. It also hasn\u2019t definitely decided to give the three-month extension beyond Oct. 31 -- though that\u2019s by far the most likely outcome.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.France was the only country which didn\u2019t support granting a Brexit extension until the end of January at a meeting of European Union ambassadors, two diplomats said, pushing instead for a one-month delay to", "authors": ["Alex Morales", "Ian Wishart", "Alexander Weber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NkTjWyiuTU10Yg.PIsgDSQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/01e7c97d590ec254040bb2745319c56f", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
