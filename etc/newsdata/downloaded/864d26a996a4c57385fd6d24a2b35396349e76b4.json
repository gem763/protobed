Being the first black captain isn't something that comes to mind, I'm just really happy for the huge privilege that it is, and for anybody who comes from my community or any community.\n\n\"I just want to represent all of the people there. Just being the Springboks captain is a huge privilege.\"\n\nSouth Africa could face Japan in the quarter-finals in a repeat of the 'Miracle of Brighton' when the Brave Blossoms stunned the Springboks 34-32 in the greatest World Cup upset of them all four years ago.\n\nJapan are currently unbeaten at this edition having produced another shock win with a 19-12 success over Ireland, and Springboks assistant coach Mzwandile Stick said: \"At the moment, the focus is just on the game we are playing.\n\n\"We know that we might face either Ireland, Japan or Scotland (in the quarter-finals).\n\n\"But it's good to see a country like Japan managing to (do well), especially as the host nation.\"\n\nStick added: \"We may call them 'smaller nations', but when it comes to the World Cup, they are showing that if you don't pitch up on the day, you are going to be hurt.\"\n\nTuesday's match is scheduled for 12:15 (SA time).\n\nTeams:\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Damian Willemse, 14 Warrick Gelant, 13 Damian de Allende, 12 Frans Steyn, 11 Sbu Nkosi, 10 Elton Jantjies, 9 Cobus Reinach, 8 Francois Louw, 7 Kwagga Smith, 6 Siya Kolisi, 5 Franco Mostert, 4 RG Snyman, 3 Vincent Koch, 2 Schalk Brits, 1 Thomas du Toit\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Frans Malherbe, 19 Eben Etzebeth, 20 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 21 Herschel Jantjies, 22 Handre Pollard, 23 Willie le Roux\n\nCanada\n\n15 Andrew Coe; 14 Jeff Hassler, 13 Conor Trainor, 12 Ciaran Hearn, 11 DTH van der Merwe; 10 Peter Nelson, 9 Phil Mack; 8 Tyler Ardron (captain), 7 Matt Heaton, 6 Lucas Rumball; 5 Kyle Baillie, 4 Evan Olmstead; 3 Jake Ilnicki, 2 Andrew Quattrin, 1 Hubert Buydens\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Benoit Piffero, 17 Djustice Sears-Duru, 18 Matt Tierney, 19 Josh Larsen, 20 Michael Sheppard, 21 Jamie Mackenzie, 22 Shane O'Leary, 23 Guiseppe du Toit", "description": "Springbok captain Siya Kolisi accepts his side will be taking a leap into the unknown when they face Canada.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9390/a2d11a7a91bb4b1f807608feffa63c40.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
