His role as the antagonizer-in-chief is unparalleled when compared to any previous occupant of the White House, and the normalization of that perceived role by many on the right is beyond unsettling.\n\nTrump's role as the antagonizer-in-chief is unparalleled when compared to any previous occupant of the White House, and the normalization of that perceived role by many on the right is beyond unsettling. Matt Laslo Journalist\n\nBut when the normalization of the president's truculence becomes coupled with content celebrating violence \u2014 even if cloaked as cartoonish memes \u2014 it becomes terrifying and dangerous.\n\nThat, however, is where we are as a nation right now, because the president has embraced the nation\u2019s love for outlandish drama and, through his general indifference to or outright celebration of their purveyors, has made memes of violence against the media seen routine to many on the right. While right-wing hated of the media isn\u2019t new, the memeing of it surely is novel.\n\nThe Watergate-era played a pivotal role in changing the way politicians, especially many on the right, viewed the press corps. Previously in American politics, lawmakers viewed the press corps as useful idiots whom they could largely trust not to discuss anything too controversial (from their well-known affairs to even American military movements) because the two groups were largely on the same page about trying to inform the American public.\n\nBut once a Republican president was forced to ingloriously leave the Oval Office under a cloud of reporter-induced shame, that party slowly started to view the press corps as the enemy. That wasn\u2019t so much because what journalists were reporting was false, but rather because the nation\u2019s scribes were actually sharing \u2014 in the open \u2014 the stories of corruption and immorality that had always been staples of Washington political life but which one didn\u2019t discuss in polite company or share with readers.\n\nIt wasn't just Watergate that changed the conservative movement's attitude toward the media: It was the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade in 1973, which made abortion legal. Once abortion was legal, the media covered it that way. That was abhorrent to GOP leaders who by the late 70s had allowed the party to become nearly fully co-opted by evangelical leaders led by Jerry Falwell, who viewed abortion as inherently immoral and the only political issue that mattered.\n\nThus, since the media had both changed public attitudes against Nixon by accurately reporting on his malfeasance and refused to report on abortion as anything other than what it was \u2014 the law of the land \u2014 the right turned against the publications who didn\u2019t pretend to carry their water.\n\nThat\u2019s how, in the late 80s and early 90s, Rush Limbaugh became a household name: Much like Trump, he brought comedy into far-right politics by mocking the nation\u2019s traditional news outlets. His mockery then devolved into the likes of Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity helping foster a conservative culture that views news outlets they disagree with as the \u201cLamestream Media.\u201d\n\nTrump took that script and made it his own: He's dubbed the media \u201cthe enemy\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d and incited his followers to boo, mock, insult and even threaten the journalists who are reporting on his rallies, opening up a dangerous can of worms. And his followers ... followed his lead.\n\nHe's helped amplify and speed up what was the slow erosion of American decency (or, at least the puritanical view of which was pervasive at the start of the last century). His combative, petty and ultimately reality-TV style of life and politics seems to have helped speed up what was already a rapid devolution of American politics.\n\nThat\u2019s enabled many self-appointed pundits online \u2014 or even the paid Fox News or CNN sanctioned talking heads \u2014 to view a video of the president slaughtering his perceived foes as either just another funny internet meme or as a completely acceptable way for Trump\u2019s allies to show the nation what they view as the president\u2019s plight.\n\nBut, just as Trump\u2019s own perceived presidential plights have been of his own making, so is the cultural acceptance of political violence. The rhetoric of \u201cbattle\u201d and \u201cwar\u201d used with political opponents has now morphed into the press being dubbed \u201cthe enemy,\u201d merely for us printing much that has since been proven to be reality. And now many conservatives view this confrontational style as natural in a modern, hyper-connected world where memes are often more \"believable\" than peer-reviewed scientific studies.\n\nNow many conservatives view this confrontational style as natural in a modern, hyper-connected world where memes are often more \"believable\" than peer-reviewed scientific studies. Matt Laslo Journalist\n\nSome in Trump\u2019s conservative base do share the blame for how we\u2019ve now reached a place where there\u2019s either an outright acceptance of a video mimicking the all too real dystopian footage it portends \u2014 but ultimately the buck stops with the president and those in his inner orbit who have willfully allowed themselves to become desensitized to this mayhem masquerading as political theater.\n\nThis, like many of Trump\u2019s unforced errors, isn\u2019t something us outsiders to conservative and alt-right circles can change. It\u2019s only something the GOP can help change, because their party changed the nation\u2019s attitude against the press. What started small has become huge, and it's roaming around the web unfettered. Only the right has the antidote for that: It's giving up the narrative of \u201cfake news\u201d altogether.\n\nMatt Laslo is a reporter who has written for NPR, Rolling Stone, The Atlantic, The Daily Beast, The Guardian and VICE News, among others.
