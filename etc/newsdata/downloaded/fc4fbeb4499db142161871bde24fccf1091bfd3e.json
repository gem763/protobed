But the toddler daughter of England star Manu Tuilagi sure knows how to fire up her daddy for perhaps the greatest game of his life.\n\nBefore his side faced the fabled All Blacks for a place in the final yesterday, Tuilagi\u2019s 18-month-old little girl Leilani Lea\u2019auta posted an inspiring Instagram message \u2013 with some help from her mum.\n\n\u2018Go Daddy\u2019 Leilani told Manu in one picture. And: \u2018So proud Daddy\u2019.\n\nThe result, as all the world now knows, was a performance that catapulted Tuilagi to legend status among fans.\n\nShortly before the two teams took the field yesterday, England\u2019s coach declared with a sly grin that Tuilagi was in his best-ever form and \u2018ready to cut loose\u2019.\n\nSince straight-talking Eddie Jones is not normally given to hyperbole, New Zealand should really have heeded his warning.\n\nBut maybe they assumed Jones was engaging in mind games, trying to secure a psychological advantage. Or maybe, when just 98 seconds after kick-off, Tuilagi did indeed cut loose and crash like a juggernaut over the line to score the most important try of his career, the mighty All Blacks simply had no way of stopping him.\n\nThe birth of Leilani Lea\u2019auta with fianc\u00e9e Chantelle Garrity (pictured) has seen Manu Tuilagi mature into the man he is today\n\nIf it had been the 28-year-old Leicester centre\u2019s sole contribution, he would still have been lauded, his name spoken with reverence in bars across England and on the Samoan island of his birth 10,000 miles away. Yet the 6ft, 17st player they call the Chief did so much more.\n\nJones warned before the match: \u2018I\u2019ve never seen the Chief in better nick... I\u2019ve never seen him physically better. I\u2019ve never seen him mentally more attuned.\u2019\n\nAnd Tuilagi more than lived up to Jones\u2019s extravagant assessment. As well as England\u2019s only try, he produced a defensive masterclass, his performance inspiring an epic victory.\n\nIt is one of Jones\u2019s many attributes that he rarely loses faith with those blessed with divine talent, however much they test him. And few have tested him like Tuilagi.\n\nMisdemeanours include jumping off a ferry into Auckland harbour, punching a rival player, making a rabbit ears sign behind then Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s head, assaulting two female police officers and a taxi driver and returning to the England hotel drunk during a pre-season training camp.\n\nAdd to that an injury list that has beset his career for years and Tuilagi has proved quite a headache for coach Jones. But all that will be forgotten (perhaps it has already) if he turns in a similar performance in the final in Yokohama on Saturday.\n\nIt is not just the coach England fans have to thank for coaxing Tuilagi to sublime form. The birth of Leilani Lea\u2019auta with fianc\u00e9e Chantelle Garrity has seen him mature into the man he is today.\n\nBut derailed by one injury too many, he might never have resumed his international career but for the intervention of a witch doctor in his homeland two years ago.\n\nTuilagi, from the small beach village of Fatausi-Fogapoa on the Samoan island of Savai\u2019i, arrived in England when he was just 13 and made it his home, later choosing to play for England rather than his homeland. He is one of seven brothers, five of whom have played Test rugby for Samoa.\n\nThe eldest, Olotuli, is a \u2018Fa\u2019afafine\u2019 or cross-dresser who has lived his life as a woman and goes by the name Julie. \u2018It\u2019s just the way he is,\u2019 Tuilagi once said.\n\n\u2018He was born like that and he wants to dress up as a woman. It doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s our brother.\u2019\n\nIn 2017 it was to his Samoan village that Manu returned when his mother, Aliitasi, insisted that he seek out the \u2018Fofo Samoa\u2019 \u2013 or witch doctor \u2013 to help \u2018rebuild\u2019 him following persistent knee injuries. \u2018My gift is to see spirits,\u2019 the spirit healer told The Mail on Sunday. \u2018This is what I have done since I was 14. I search for people\u2019s Ma\u2019i [sickness] and find out if it is caused by the spirits.\u2019\n\nTuilagi spent four days in the Fofo Samoa\u2019s company and was treated with Fijian oils in order, the healer claimed, to cast away three women who had \u2018told me Manu belongs to them\u2019. He added: \u2018I massaged his body with oils made from coconut, frangipani, sandalwood, rose. I saw that three lady spirits were following him and I cast them away and I told Manu he will play rugby again. Now he is protected.\u2019\n\nEngland's Ben Youngs (right) celebrates scoring a try with Henry Slade (left) and Manu Tuilagi at the semi final match\n\nClearly it worked, the healer achieving something that had seemed beyond modern medicine. It had been a long and dark process. Some, himself included, had doubted whether he would ever run out at Twickenham again. \u2018At one point he was down, very down,\u2019 said fellow Samoan Logovi\u2019i Mulipola who shared a bachelor pad with him in a Leicester suburb. \u2018I think the secret to his recovery was back in Samoa. The people around him and his family...\u2019\n\nTuilagi adores his adopted homeland. However, his illegal immigrant status threatened to wreck his burgeoning career having entered the country on a holiday visa and over-staying by six years. The Home Office wanted to deport him but in 2009 he played for Leicester against South Africa in a televised match that would prove a crucial turning point.\n\nLeicester beat South Africa 22-17 and Tuilagi was one of the stars of the show. His solicitor managed to secure a court order to prevent his arrest and won the right to appeal.\n\nThen, fans started a petition on Facebook and in 2010, the UK Border Agency granted Tuilagi leave to remain. Which, England fans will agree, was just as well.\n\nThe stage is now set for the greatest match of his career \u2013 and the chance to earn a place among the pantheon of England\u2019s sporting greats. And no doubt little Leilani Lea\u2019auta will be planning to fire up her daddy once again.", "description": "Daughter of England rugby hero Manu Tuilagi posted  Instagram message with the help of her mother.
