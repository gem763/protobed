The Recruiter said that Epstein is a \"caring guy,\" that he said she \"should not be struggling,\" and that he wanted \"to be there for her.\"'\n\nEpstein was described as a 'nice guy' with a great deal of wealth by the recruiter, who also told Araoz 'you have to see his house'.\n\nThe recruiter was ultimately able to convince Araoz to come meet Epstein at his mansion, which according to the complaint was filled with surveillance cameras.\n\nAt the end of the first visit, Epstein gave Araoz $300 in cash and said: 'Here\u2019s a little something to help you out. I take care of the people I care about.'\n\nHe also informed her that he was 'a big AIDS activist' according to the complaint.\n\nThings then began to slowly progress according to the complaint, with Araoz stating she continued to visit the billionaire businessman because his home was so close to her school.\n\nThe second visit resulted in Araoz getting money again and a camera.\n\n'Ms. Araoz visited Epstein\u2019s home with the Recruiter about once or twice a week for the first month,' sattes the complaint.\n\n'Each time, Ms. Araoz stayed between 1-2 hours, and at the end of the stay, Epstein would direct his Secretary to give her $300 and just say that he \"wanted to help her out,\" while she and the Recruiter would be served cheese, crackers and wine by the Maid.'\n\nA month into this arrangement, the recruiter was removed from the occasion, and Epstein's secretary would call Araoz to directly set up her visits.\n\nThen came the first alleged incident of sexual molestation, on the same day Epstein showed the victim his massage room according to the legal filing.\n\n'Epstein showed Ms. Araoz the art work in the room and the massage table, stating that \"not many people know about this room,\"' states the complaint.\n\nHe later told the Araoz 'you really should be a model,' 'you\u2019re beautiful,' 'I\u2019ll bet your body is incredible,' and that 'in order to help you with your modeling career, I will need to see your body.'\n\nThe complaint states that Epstein also noted how he liked 'girls with small breasts,' and after some badgering was able to get Araoz to take off her bra, at which point he began rubbing her breasts and nude shoulders.\n\n'He then asked her if she was good at giving massages and, considering all of the financial help he had been giving her family over the past month, insinuated that he would like one,' states the court filing.\n\n'Epstein then walked out of the room and returned in a bathrobe. He instructed Ms. Araoz to remove everything but her bottom underwear, and laid down on the massage table (with only a towel on) instructing Ms. Araoz to proceed with a back massage.'\n\nThe complaint details some of the physical markings on Epstein's body, particularly around his back and genital areas\n\n'After massaging Epstein\u2019s back for about 20 to 25 minutes, Epstein suddenly turned over, removed his towel and began masturbating,' reads the complaint.\n\n'Ms. Araoz, feeling uncomfortable and intimated, stood frozen to the side of the massage table as Epstein ejaculated on himself.'\n\nPrior to the incident, Araoz claims that Epstein said: '\u201cI take care of you, you take care of me.'\n\nAnd when it was over he told her: 'This was amazing, you\u2019re beautiful, I can\u2019t wait to see you again. I will give you a call during the week and we\u2019ll see each other again.'\n\nHe then took her on a tour of his home and showed her a room 'he said was designed to look like his favorite room at the White House' that was 'blue and had a distinct oval shape.'", "description": "A number of Epstein's trustees are listed as are the two men who were appointed as the executors of his estate - Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/00/19466050-0-image-a-23_1570576979404.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
