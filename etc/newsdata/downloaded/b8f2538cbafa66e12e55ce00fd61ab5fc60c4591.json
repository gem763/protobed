So they resembled the Washington Nationals a bit in Game 3.\n\nDuring his interview session on Thursday, Astros manager A.J. Hinch commented on the Nationals\u2019 outburst in Game 2, noting that some hits \u201cwere pretty low contact, low velocity.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention the shaky fielding that Washington capitalized on, but we all saw it. A bobble here and an errant throw there, all of which helped put Houston in an 0-2 series hole.\n\nBut on Friday, the Astros were the recipients of good fortune and the punishers of bad mistakes, slowly building a lead and holding on for a 4-1 victory at frenetic Nationals Park.\n\nHouston quickly made it clear that Washington starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez would not reprise his last outing \u2013 a no-hitter through seven innings against St. Louis in the National League Championship Series. Center fielder George Springer led off with an infield single, a ball that S\u00e1nchez tried and failed to field cleanly.\n\nNo damage came as a result, but the Astros used a line drive and bloop single to score a run in the second. Thus a pattern was established, death by a thousand cuts and a string of lone runs.\n\nThere was no magic comeback this time. There will be no sweep. The 44,000 red-clad, towel-waving fans didn\u2019t enjoy a victory in the city\u2019s first World Series game since 1933. Nonetheless, a good time was had by all. Decibel levels remained high and seats remained filled until the not-so-bitter end.\n\nIf you overlook the fact that, you know, they lost, the Nationals did provide some enjoyable moments. Unfortunately, most of them were in the field instead of at the plate.\n\nCenter fielder Victor Robles crashed into the wall to rob Jose Altuve and right fielder Adam Eaton made a diving grab to steal a hit from Josh Reddick. Shortstop Trent Turner turned in a couple of nice plays, including one with a jump throw, capped on the other end by first baseman Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s dramatic, sweeping scoop.\n\nBut across the diamond, the 107-win Astros reminded everyone why they had the majors\u2019 best record. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty good, too,\u201d Hinch said after his team snapped Washington\u2019s eight-game win streak and held the Nationals to their lowest output Oct. 3.\n\nJust like Houston ace Gerrit Cole was bound to take a loss at some point after winning 19 consecutive decisions, Washington was due to come up short eventually, too. That\u2019s why the loss doesn\u2019t seem to faze anyone. The mantra of \u201cgo 1-0 today\u201d has been drilled into the team and fan base so thoroughly, failing to meet the objective won\u2019t be a big deal until it happens in an elimination game.\n\nThe Nationals can write off Friday as a bad loss against a good team, a lesson they\u2019ve administered to Houston, St. Louis and the Los Angeles Dodgers along the way.\n\nWashington didn\u2019t hit with runners in scoring position (0-for-10), a deficiency that Houston exhibited in the first two games but corrected on Friday (4-for-10). The Nationals also committed two errors, including one by Juan Soto, who didn\u2019t have a happy birthday. He mishandled Altuve\u2019s third-inning double, allowing Houston\u2019s diminutive spark plug to advance to third (and later score). In the second inning, Soto airmailed a throw to home plate, allowing Josh Reddick to advance.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t much better at the plate, either, where he went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts. \u201cHe\u2019s been really good,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cI just hope he hits at age 21.\u201d\n\nAmong the Astros\u2019 11 hits were three of the infield variety, including a couple that deflected off Sanibel. Two nights earlier, the Nationals caused havoc with some balls that didn\u2019t reach the outfield. Friday it was Houston\u2019s turn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game of breaks,\u201d Houston left fielder Michael Brantley said. \u201cWhen they make miscues and we can capitalize on it, it\u2019s very important. We got some breaks tonight and the ball bounced our way. So that\u2019s important, and hopefully we get a few more along the way.\u201d\n\nHinch had promised his team would show up and not roll over. The Astros aren\u2019t the Cardinals. Houston secured what essentially was a must-win, and the Nationals simply tipped their cap.\n\n\u201cHey, we\u2019ve still got a lot of baseball left,\u201d Martinez said Thursday, which he could\u2019ve repeated Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to focus on today and go home, rest and get ready to play and go 1-0 again. That\u2019s been the message all year. We don\u2019t try to get ahead of ourselves.\u201d\n\nBrooklyn-born and Howard-educated, Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
