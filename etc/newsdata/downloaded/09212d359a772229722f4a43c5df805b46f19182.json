They responded so badly, they should resign.\n\nLast week I wrote about a suburban Chicago school district\u2019s Oct. 7-11 week of LGBT curriculum as an example of what the state legislature has required all Illinois public schools to teach starting next July. Although the Evanston/Skokie school district is in a very liberal area, not all parents were comfortable with their preschoolers being taught, among other things, that polyamorous families are equivalent to families of sexually faithful married biological parents, and that being gay simply means \u201cloving\u201d someone of your own sex.\n\nAccording to a local newspaper called the Evanston RoundTable, the district\u2019s administrators and school board heard from several dozen upset parents after their children started coming home and talking about what they were learning about sex in school. These officials responded with a condescending, inaccurate, and embarrassing defense of themselves.\n\nHere are some highlights from the Evanston RoundTable report.\n\n1. Teaching Transgenderism to Preschoolers Is \u2018Age-Appropriate\u2019\n\nA Sept. 24 letter from District 65\u2019s two interim superintendents and the head of the local teachers union twice said the district\u2019s LGBT curriculum was \u201cage appropriate.\u201d Emphasis added in the below quotes from the letter:\n\nWe are deeply appreciative of District 65 educators and members of the district\u2019s Gender and Sexuality Educators Alliance (GSEA) for the many hours they spent this summer developing robust, thoughtful, and age-appropriate curriculum for use in D65. \u2026All content has been developed to ensure that it is both developmentally and age-appropriate for all students.\n\nAt an Oct. 7 board committee meeting, school board President Suni Kartha reiterated: \u201cThis really is a wonderful, thoughtful, age-appropriate curriculum.\u201d\n\nIn my article last week, I sampled the district\u2019s \u201cage-appropriate curriculum\u201d for children ages 3 to 5. It included numerous LGBT picture books such as the well-known \u201cHeather Has Two Mommies\u201d and \u201cThey He She, Easy as ABC\u201d about using trans pronouns.\n\nThese preschoolers were told they can be \u201cjust like\u201d a transgender teen celebrity named Jazz Jennings, and that transgender means having one sex\u2019s body but a different sex\u2019s brain (which is not backed by one iota of medical science). They were taught \u201cWe are all allowed to choose what gender we are.\u201d They were shown this video:\n\nThese preschoolers and kindergarteners were taught \u201cSometimes people use their bodies to help them know their gender, and some people know their gender in their heart.\u201d Also: \u201cIf you have two mommies, they can be called LESBIANS. That means that they are two women who love each other.\u201d\n\nThis is a common way of explaining LGBT sexuality to young children in the curricula I have reviewed, such as the Queer Kids Stuff channel on YouTube (which District 65\u2019s curriculum also linked to). Yet it\u2019s neither age-appropriate nor accurate. Since preschoolers don\u2019t know what intercourse is (and mostly shouldn\u2019t), they are likely to understand that \u201cloving\u201d means feeling affection, which every normal preschooler does with people of both sexes, and that doesn\u2019t affect their sexuality one bit.\n\nTo state what should be obvious, sexual attraction is not the same as love. I don\u2019t know about all of you readers, but I love lots of people whose genitals I never want to touch. Deliberately obscuring crucial realities like this, and by trusted adults to children who have no knowledge of the world to help them know this is a lie, is one reason to call what the district did propaganda.\n\nAnd the fact that these people think this is \u201cage-appropriate\u201d for preschoolers or, frankly, children of any other age, completely discredits their expertise and authority. They should all resign for egregiously abusing their power. But of course they won\u2019t.\n\n2. Sex Education Isn\u2019t Sex Education\n\nDuring the school board\u2019s meeting, the district\u2019s assistant superintendent for curriculum, Stacy Beardsley, stated, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in [the district\u2019s LGBT curriculum] that overlaps with sexual education that would require any form of opt out that State law requires.\u201d As I noted in my earlier article, far-left activists have deliberately detached the gender ideology being taught in public schools from sex ed because many states provide extra legal rights to parents for sex ed, such as informed consent and opt-out.\n\nIt\u2019s no matter to them that the only difference between a gay person and a straight person is the kind of sex each engages in, and thus any LGBT instruction obviously falls into sex ed. The defining element of being LGBT is one\u2019s preferred sexual behavior, and absolutely nothing else. Thus any LGBT instruction is necessarily sex ed.\n\nThis is just a patent attempt to bypass state laws that obviously apply. When Christians do this, with much more legitimacy, by things like trying to have the Bible taught in world religions or world history, the left loses its everloving mind. That\u2019s because their rule is \u201cYou follow the laws we make whether you like it or not, and we do whatever we want regardless of what the laws say.\u201d\n\n3. Religion Has Nothing to Say about Sex\n\n\u201c[W]hen people were talking about religious objections, it does become challenging, so we\u2019ve been trying to help people understand that this is not a religious curriculum, this is not a curriculum that is advocating any form of sexuality,\u201d Beardsley said, according to the RoundTable.\n\nWhere can people have ever gotten the ridiculous idea that any religions have anything at all to say about sexuality? In the event that Beardsley has only ever heard from culturally assimilated Christians on this, maybe she should make time to talk to, say, a practicing Muslim about whether sexual behaviors have any religious component.\n\n4. Let\u2019s Deliberately Keep Parents in the Dark\n\nThe school board also discussed what to do about the fact that parents were keeping their kids home from school during the LGBT week to protect their kids. The Evanston/Skokie school board\u2019s vice president, Anya Tanyavutti, suggested in response, \u201cNot telling people the time of the curriculum is an option.\u201d\n\nPreviously the school district\u2019s LGBT curriculum was fully available online, but it has now been made available only to people the district has approved for access.\n\nIn the several other states that are passing laws to require all public schools to teach curriculum like this, including California and New Jersey, U.S. Attorney General William Barr noted, this practice of forbidding opt-outs is common.\n\n5. Differences of Opinion Make People \u2018Fearful,\u2019 \u2018Unsafe\u2019\n\nAn unnamed teacher told the school board that she and LGBT people whose emails had been given out to answer public questions had received \u201chorrifying\u201d emails. The RoundTable reported no details from this teacher about what \u201chorrifying\u201d meant, whether there were legitimate threats to these persons\u2019 safety, or whether these emails expressed simply diverse viewpoints.\n\n\u201cOur names are linked to this curriculum, and there is real fear. \u2026 We didn\u2019t want to be out this weekend in Evanston because we are truly fearful. I need that to sit with all of you. We are now truly unsafe in this community in which some of us live and all of us teach in,\u201d the teacher claimed.\n\n6. No Opt-Outs Allowed\n\nUpon hearing reports that one school principal had \u2014 horrors! \u2014 informed parents of when the sexual indoctrination lessons would take place each day so they could take their kids home, school administrators discussed cracking down on this limited exercise of parent choice.\n\nAt an Oct. 7 school board meeting, Beardsley \u201csaid she had just spent 30 minutes on the phone explaining to a parent why there was no opt out,\u201d the RoundTable reported.\n\nWhat amount of harmful instruction will and should parents put up with before moving their kids to better schools?\n\nAs I reported earlier, the next day school board president \u201cKartha sent parents and staff a statement: \u2018Our administration has heard from a number of parents who want the ability to opt their children out of this curriculum. The District 65 Board of Education does not support allowing students to opt out of this or any curriculum that seeks to include a more complete account of the role of historically marginalized people in our society.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe unnamed teacher complained about parents pulling their kids and two school principals allowing children to work puzzles or get picked up by parents during the instruction time. The board and other officials discussed ensuring this could not happen in the future.\n\n\u201cIf the family says that they are refusing to have their child be part of the learning, we are not providing that safe space in the building and providing any form of alternate education,\u201d Beardsley said. \u201c\u2026I stand by the fact that all kids should be part of the learning.\u201d\n\nThe unnamed teacher asked, according to the RoundTable, \u201cCan people opt-out of Black Lives Matter or the science curriculum that doesn\u2019t meet the religious belief of a family?\u201d Note that the teacher equated political propaganda with actual science instruction. Are the two comparable in this school district? Affirming anti-science positions like the gender unicorn certainly ought to make parents and taxpayers wonder about a school\u2019s science and humanities instruction.\n\nThese district employees do, however, have an underlying point. If parents can opt out of one thing, why not another? How far does that extend, and why? What amount of harmful instruction will and should parents put up with before moving their kids to better schools? Do parents really think the kids who skip one week of school aren\u2019t hearing about it from their peers once they go back? In fact, the district\u2019s curriculum explicitly instructed teachers to include LGBT materials in other classes throughout the year, such as reading. The state has mandated that all schools start teaching it in history in 2020.\n\nHow can parents trust anything from any school that fails so horrifically on something so basic? Should taxpayers have to fund leftist propaganda that harms children? When are we going to get our kids and money back? By then will it be too late?", "description": "An Illinois school district's leaders heard from upset parents after the children started talking about what they were learning about LGBT sex in school.", "authors": ["Joy Pullmann"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/myprincessboybook.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
