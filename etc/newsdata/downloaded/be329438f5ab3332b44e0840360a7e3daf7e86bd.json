We have seen each other when we have been vulnerable and that often brings teams closer.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s semi-final promises to be a defining match of Eddie Jones\u2019s four-year reign as England coach.\n\nThe Australian, in charge of his native Wallabies when they lost to England in the 2003 World Cup final, was appointed to his current post following England\u2019s first-round exit on home soil at the 2015 edition.\n\nYet he soon made no secret of his belief they could be crowned champions in Japan.\n\nAll of Itoje\u2019s 32 England appearances have come under Jones.\n\nBut the dynamic second row said his faith in England dated back to their 2007 World Cup final defeat by a South Africa side being advised by the veteran coach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed, even as a young rugby fan,\u201d Itoje recalled.\n\n\u201cI remember watching the 2007 Rugby World Cup \u2013- that was probably the first World Cup where rugby really captured my imagination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always seen England as a team that should be there competing for World Cups and should be there winning World Cups,\u201d explained the Saracens second row.\n\n\u201cAs a young rugby player you watch all these tournaments and think: \u2018I want to win. I want to be part of something special.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen Eddie said that, I hadn\u2019t played for England at that point, but I definitely bought into it from the jump.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Maro Itoje reckons this \u201cfeels like the time we\u2019re going to get them\u201d as England bid to end New Zealand\u2019s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/377385_england-lock-maro-itoje-takes-in-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-new-zealand-we-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
