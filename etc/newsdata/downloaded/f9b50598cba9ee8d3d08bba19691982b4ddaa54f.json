There has been speculation that the plane was brought down deliberately. A film released this year, Cold Case Hammarskj\u00f6ld, a winner at the 2019 Sundance film festival, has continued to stir interest.\n\nNow a report from Mohamed Chande Othman, a former chief justice of Tanzania who was appointed by the UN to review any new information relating to the case, suggests that Britain is dragging its heels.\n\nThe UK ran intelligence agents across Africa in the 1960s and has been asked to share any information it has on the crash. \u201cThe UK and the United States must be almost certain to hold important undisclosed information,\u201d claims Othman, adding that it took 15 months for Britain to respond to a request for information.\n\nHe adds: \u201cDespite the United Kingdom having been identified as very likely to hold relevant information, and in spite of my indicating specific areas where such information may be found, no new documents or other information have been received, and responses were not given on the detailed queries that I communicated.\u201d\n\nLast year the UN asked 14 countries \u2013 including the UK, South Africa, the United States and Russia \u2013 to each appoint an independent official to conduct a review of their intelligence, security and defence archives.\n\nThe British review was conducted within a month. In his report. Othman notes: \u201cI do not think it fair to expect that a month was adequate to accomplish a comprehensive review of this nature and covering the extensive grounds requested.\u201d The report urges Britain and other countries with information to engage \u201cfurther and deeper\u201d with the UN investigation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dag Hammarskjold in 1953.

Congo was receiving Soviet aid and had the world\u2019s richest uranium reserves. In the shadows, the KGB, the CIA and MI6 all pushed their countries\u2019 interests.\n\nA series of inquiries has explored various hypotheses for the crash, including an aerial or ground attack, sabotage, hijacking and human error. The sole survivor, Harold Julien, said there was an explosion before the plane fell from the sky. He died from his injuries six days later.\n\nCold Case Hammarskj\u00f6ld claims that a Belgian pilot named Jan van Risseghem had confessed to shooting down the UN plane.
