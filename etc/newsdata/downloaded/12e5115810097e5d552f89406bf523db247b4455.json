Photo: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive\n\nAsk a woman who cares about clothes to recommend a white T-shirt and she\u2019ll either lean in conspiratorially and let you in on her secret \u2014 or she\u2019ll admit that she\u2019s never quite been able to identify the perfect white T-shirt and then beg you for intel. The white T-shirt is indeed many things to many women: called upon to sit under a blazer just so, to tuck into jeans nonchalantly, to casually underscore a silk skirt. It might not be the star of the show, but if it looks off, then everything else will too \u2014 so getting the white T-shirt right (the fit, the cut, the fabric, the neckline) is a must. To help with your search, we asked ten stylish women \u2014 including ladies from the worlds of fashion, food, publishing, and the arts \u2014 to get their recommendations for the best white T-shirts. Read on for their picks, featuring styles for pretty much anyone \u2014 including the best for big and for small boobs, the best for work and for weddings, and the best budget and luxury options.\n\nThe best inexpensive white T-shirt\n\nFruit of the Loom Unisex Kids Sofspun T-Shirt When restaurateur Samantha Lim got married two years ago, she had Raf Simons\u2019s \u2018iconic\u2019 Jil Sander spring/summer collection in mind \u2014 \u2018the floor-length skirt with a perfect white T-shirt, an all-time favourite mood\u2019. She sourced \u2018loads of different T-shirt options both low and high\u2019 before ultimately deciding to opt for a Fruit of the Loom Kids Sofspun cotton T-shirt. She generally wears a small in adult clothes, and opted for the largest size available in the kids\u2019 range. \u2018It has a super-soft feel and slim-fit cut\u2019, she says. \u2018It\u2019s a very basic plain crew neck, but without the capped sleeve most ladies\u2019 T-shirts have. It can survive a good wash\u2019. \u00a34 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nThe best plus-size white T-shirt\n\nLevi's Loose Cut Cotton T-Shirt \u00a315 (was \u00a323, now 35% off) Writer Bethany Rutter says, \u2018I love all my Levi\u2019s T-shirts, but this one, with the tiny little logo, feels like such a classic, like a \u201990s-supermodel look. A lot of people don\u2019t know they do plus sizes but they do and they\u2019re great\u2019. In fact, Levi\u2019s make this T-shirt up to a size 26. A loose-cut tee in a light cotton, it\u2019s a relaxed choice that works for all body types. \u00a315 at Navabi Buy\n\nThe best formal white T-shirt\n\nEverlane Pima Micro Rib Crew Tee This form-fitting T-shirt is a good choice for dressier occasions. Stylist Victoria Sekrier, who has rules when it comes to T-shirts, is a fan. \u2018I strictly wear fitted T-shirts, sort of \u201970s style\u2019, she says. \u2018Everlane has a great one that they continuously stock. The rib is really fine, so it looks formal enough if you wear it with a suit\u2019. One thing to note, however, is \u2018you have to wear a bra, as it\u2019s fairly transparent\u2019. \u00a325 at Everlane Buy\n\nThe best white T-shirt if you\u2019re small with big boobs\n\nASOS DESIGN Petite ultimate organic cotton T-shirt with crew neck in white \u2018As a 5\u2019 4\u201d woman with larger than average tits (30E), it\u2019s very hard to find a tee that fits well\u2019, says actor and writer Rosie Kellett. \u2018Either they are too fitted or they are too loose and drop off your chest like a tent, creating a rather unflattering, shapeless look. This ASOS one is different\u2019. The soft jersey fabric (this tee is made from 100 percent organic cotton) means it is gently fitted but not too clingy, making it a flattering choice for those who are petite with big boobs. As Rosie says: \u2018It is a cheapie but a goodie\u2019. \u00a36 at ASOS Buy\n\nThe best white T-shirt for when you don\u2019t want to wear a bra\n\nArket Heavy-Weight T-shirt \u2019I don\u2019t wear a bra, so if I\u2019m wearing a white tee with no jacket, I prefer heavier cotton, which shows less nipple action\u2019, says Lotte Jeffs, author of How to Be a Gentlewoman. \u2018This fit isn\u2019t super-loose, so it can be tucked \u2014 but it\u2019s still a flattering shape if worn loose. The round high neck is parallel stitched, which is a nice detail\u2019. (This tee is also a good option for bra wearers who don\u2019t like their bra to be visible.) \u00a335 at Arket Buy\n\nThe best scoop-neck white T-shirt\n\nMarks and Spencer Pure Supima Cotton Regular Fit T-Shirt M&S has recently overhauled its T-shirt offering, fashion writer and editor Frankie Graddon tells me, \u2018reconsidering details and upping the style factor\u2019, and this scoop-neck tee is the best of the bunch. \u2018The Regular Fit T-shirt has just the right balance of fit versus slouch\u2019, she says, \u2018and is made from supersoft Supima cotton\u2019. \u00a315 at Marks and Spencer Buy\n\nThe best multipack white T-shirt\n\nHanes Men's Undershirt (Pack of 7) Even if you identify a perfect white T-shirt, there is always the possibility (or certainty) that it won\u2019t stay perfect. Sweat stains, makeup marks, lunch \u2014 the white tee has many enemies. Buying in bulk is a good idea, and magazine editor Grace Banks invests in these Hanes men\u2019s undershirts, finding them super-versatile. \u2018I lounge around the house in them\u2019, she says, \u2018or sometimes wear them with a skirt\u2019. As these are men\u2019s T-shirts, they are longer than women\u2019s, and you might find it\u2019s wise to buy them in different sizes \u2014 small might work for wearing with skirts, while medium is good for lounging or sleeping in. \u00a335 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nThe best linen white T-shirt\n\nArket Organic Linen T-shirt \u00a318 (was \u00a335, now 49% off) After writer and performer Jess Latowicki bought a white linen T-shirt in the Acne sale five years ago, she \u2018wore it to death\u2019. When it came to replacing it, she turned to Arket and found what she calls an \u2018excellent substitute\u2019. The scooped neckline is \u2018ultrafeminine\u2019, and \u2018like all linen tees, the fabric is slightly sheer, which I\u2019m into\u2019. \u2018I normally hand-wash linen\u2019, she says, \u2018but I have thrown this in with the rest of the wash a few times and it\u2019s maintained its shape and texture really well\u2019. Best of all, \u2018it\u2019s not at all itchy!\u2019 \u00a318 at Arket Buy\n\nThe best stretchy white T-shirt\n\nThe best boxy white T-shirt\n\nEverlane Cotton Box-cut Pocket Tee \u2019I love this T-shirt so much\u2019, says Jess Latowicki of this versatile number. \u2018The short, wider cut works both tucked in and hitting just below the waist\u2019. Like all of Everlane\u2019s shirts, \u2018it washes really well\u2019 and the \u2018white feels very neutral \u2014 not too blue, not too yellow\u2019. The cotton manages to both be light and structured, she says, so it looks smart and neat while still being comfortable. \u2018And\u2019, Jess says, \u2018who doesn\u2019t love a boob pocket?\u2019 \u00a315 at Everlane Buy\n\nThe best fashion white T-shirt\n\nSimone Rocha Layered floral-appliqu\u00e9d tulle and cotton-jersey top \u2019Simone Rocha is an absolute genius, especially when it comes to a frock, but she also does a very good T-shirt\u2019, says Samantha Lim, who praises Rocha\u2019s \u2018twists on the classic that add a little something extra\u2019. Puffed sleeves and layers of tulle transform the white T-shirt from trusty staple to star of the show. \u00a3157 at The Outnet Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
