To be that far apart is embarrassing and disappointing.\n\n\u201cWhen Jose Mourinho was there we could see that there were a lot of players that were clearly not happy, and we\u2019re seeing that again now.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cOle came in and boosted the team momentarily but, right now, the players look completely miserable there.\n\n\u201cUnited fans deserve more. They\u2019ll always support the team and club, as we heard and saw from them against Newcastle, cheering and clapping for Ole.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll always back their team but they want to see improvements. They\u2019ve got to see some progress, something that makes them believe in what\u2019s happening at the club.\u201d\n\n*Paul Ince was speaking exclusively to Paddy Power News.
