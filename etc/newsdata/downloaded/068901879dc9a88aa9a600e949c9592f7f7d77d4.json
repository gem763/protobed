Torres was checked on the field and stayed in to hit his 37th homer before being replaced by Tyler Wade in the sixth.\n\nDJ LeMahieu had four hits for New York, his AL-leading 58th multi-hit game of the season. The Yankees had 19 hits, matching their season high for a nine-inning game.\n\nNew York failed to homer Friday, snapping a nine-game streak.The Yankees have 20 homers over their past seven games, and have hit multiple home runs in 14 of their past 19. They have an MLB-best 285 home runs this season, which is also a big league record for homers by any team in a year. Minnesota is second with 280.\n\nMike Ford hit the fifth and final home run Saturday, a two-run blast off Justin Shafer in New York\u2019s four-run ninth.\n\nPaxton (14-6) allowed one run on three hits, becoming the first Yankees pitcher since Mike Mussina to win nine consecutive starts. The left-hander\u2019s 14 wins are also a career best.\n\nMussina won his final two starts of the 2002 season, then seven straight to begin 2003. The last Yankees pitcher to win nine straight starts in the same season was Ron Guidry, who won 11 in a row in 1979.\n\nGardner homered off right-hander Jacob Waguespack to begin the fourth, then added a three-run blast off Stewart in the fifth. He has 25 homers, extending his career high. It was the ninth multi-homer game of Gardner\u2019s career and his second this season. He also hit two at Detroit Tuesday.\n\nGardner has 20 career home runs against Toronto, more than any other opponent.\n\nThe veteran outfielder also made a great play in center, leaping into the scoreboard to catch a drive by Toronto\u2019s Danny Jansen in the fifth. According to Statcast, Gardner ran 126 feet to make the play.\n\nWaguespack (4-5) allowed three runs and seven hits in 3 2/3 innings. He is 0-4 with an 8.40 ERA in his past four starts.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nYankees: RHP Dellin Betances (lat) will fly to Toronto Saturday and is expected to be activated off the injured list Sunday, manager Aaron Boone said. Betances made his third rehab appearance with Double-A Trenton Friday, allowing one run and two hits in one inning.

Gregorius played both games of Thursday\u2019s doubleheader and played all 12 innings Friday.\n\nBlue Jays: LHP Tim Mayza has a torn ligament in his left elbow and will undergo Tommy John surgery.

He\u2019s expected to miss the 2020 season. \u2026 RHP Jordan Romano left in the eighth after he was struck by Gardner\u2019s liner and injured his right ankle as he fell.

Gurriel doubled in his first at-bat and was hit by a pitch the second time up. He finished 2 for 3. \u2026 C Luke Maile (left oblique) was activated off the 10-day injured list.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: LHP Jordan Montgomery will return from elbow surgery last year to start Sunday\u2019s series finale.
