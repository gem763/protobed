That dynamic will be on display Tuesday night less than 15 miles from O.S.U., when the candidates gather for the fourth primary debate at Otterbein University in Westerville.\n\nTwo top candidates, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have successfully pushed the primary conversation to the left. The D.S.A. saw drastic growth in its membership when Mr. Sanders, himself a democratic socialist, ran for president in 2016, and there are now nearly 60,000 members across the country. (Ms. Warren, who has pulled ahead of Mr. Sanders in polling and is a leading candidate for the nomination, backs many of the same progressive priorities as Mr. Sanders, but has also said she is \u201ca capitalist to my bones.\u201d)\n\nThe national leaders of the Young Democratic Socialists of America have seized on Mr. Sanders\u2019s momentum with younger voters to expand their group\u2019s membership, too, growing from 25 registered chapters in 2016 to 84 in 2019, according to a Y.D.S.A organizer. Chapters have begun to spring up at high schools, as well.", "description": "As the presidential debate comes to Ohio, the students in a local chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America are defining their political identity.", "authors": ["Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/us/politics/15ydsa1/15ydsa1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
