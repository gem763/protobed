The company reiterated its forecast for the year and through to 2023.\n\nMorgan also praised the performance of Qualtrics, the customer experience platform that SAP acquired a year ago in an $8 billion deal that some analysts and investors criticised as overpriced.\n\nShe said that Qualtrics had added more than 300 clients since May, with customers often buying it together with SAP\u2019s human resources product SuccessFactors. Qualtrics founder Ryan Smith - now an SAP management board member - said its deal size had grown by 30% since the takeover.\n\nUNDER NEW MANAGEMENT\n\nDisclosure of the Microsoft partnership comes after long-time CEO Bill McDermott stepped down to make way for Morgan - the first woman to become CEO of a company in Germany\u2019s blue-chip DAX index - and fellow Co-CEO Christian Klein.\n\nShares, which had rallied strongly on news of the leadership handover, added another 2.3% in trading in Frankfurt on Monday.\n\nThe deal - which helped SAP double new cloud bookings in the third quarter - addresses a complaint from many customers that it is too hard to shift from SAP\u2019s traditional on-premise model to remotely hosted services.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A view shows a sign with the logo of SAP software company on the roof of an office building in Moscow, Russia April 23, 2018.

These picked up by 5.4 percentage points to 69% in the third quarter - compared with a 2023 target of 75%.\n\nSAP is due to update investors on strategy at a capital markets\u2019 day in New York on Nov. 12.", "description": "Business software group SAP said on Monday it had reached a three-year deal with Microsoft to help its large enterprise customers move their business processes into the cloud.", "authors": ["Douglas Busvine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443375447&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K12I", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
