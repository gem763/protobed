Watch the informative documentary The Crystal Calls \u2014 Making The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, which premiered on Netflix alongside the new series, and you\u2019ll receive a striking glimpse of a road not traveled. In a featured scene from a 2016 demo reel, a Skeksi, one of the series\u2019 vulture-like ruling-class villains, menaces a Gelfing, one of its elfin good guys. The Skeksi is a puppet, and its terrifying appearance will look familiar to fans of The Dark Crystal, a 1982 fantasy film directed by Jim Henson and Frank Oz to which the ten-episode Netflix series serves as a prequel. The Gelfling, however, is a CG effect, and while it wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a different sort of fantasy film, it looks all wrong for Thra, the setting of both the Dark Crystal and its prequel. Thra is a world filled with puppets. And filling a world with puppets takes a lot of work, as anyone involved with the project will tell you.\n\n\u201cLouis had never shot puppets,\u201d veteran puppeteer Alice Dinnean says, referring to series director Louis Leterrier, a veteran of action and fantasy films like The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk, and the 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what puppets can\u2019t do. So he just said, \u2018This is what the puppets will do.\u2019 And we said, quietly to ourselves, \u2018Puppets can\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d She pauses, then continues. \u201cAnd then we figured out how to make it happen.\u201d\n\nLeterrier, however, tells the story a little differently. \u201cI actually knew what puppets could do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t accept it. [\u2026] I didn\u2019t accept physics, in a sense. I was like, \u2018I know, I know. I understand. But let\u2019s keep going. Let\u2019s go a little bit further.\u2019\u201d\n\nGoing a little bit further meant attempting feats never before realized with puppets, while staying true to the vision of the original film, a now-beloved classic that divided critics and met with tepid box office in December of 1982 \u2014 though not for a lack of effort on the part of its creators. In advance of the film\u2019s release, Henson and Oz used interviews and TV appearances to prepare audiences for a film featuring no human characters, one darker and stranger than previous projects bearing the Henson name. \u201cThe Muppets are performing,\u201d Henson told the New York Times ahead of the film\u2019s release. \u201cThese characters are acting.\u201d\n\nThe Dark Crystal\u2019s production spanned five years, during which Henson and Oz picked up collaborators like Star Wars co-producer Gary Kurtz and Brian Froud, an English fantasy illustrator most widely known for the best-selling 1978 book Faeries. Henson admired Froud\u2019s ability to create an otherworldly fantasy universe with roots in Froud\u2019s home in picturesque Dartmoor, in southern England. Their collaboration would prove crucial in creating the look of Thra and its inhabitants, most of which bear little resemblance to the cast of The Muppet Show and Sesame Street. Yet for all they achieved, Henson still expressed frustration about the limits he discovered making the film, telling the Times, \u201cThese creatures can do very little of what you want them to do. [\u2026] They can\u2019t fight, can\u2019t reach over and pick up props. We had to be like magicians, with a whole series of tricks and illusions to fool the audience.\u201d\n\nThat the film proved to be a financial disappointment undoubtedly intensified that frustration, but The Dark Crystal began to pick up a cult following almost from the moment it left theaters, thanks to video rentals and cable airings. Not that its creators could have known this at the time.\n\n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t know,\u201d Froud replies when asked if they anticipated its second life. \u201cObviously we were disappointed, but in many ways we made the film we wanted to see, as the creators. It was of an age when things weren\u2019t so focused on who it was for. It always felt like we made a film everybody would want to watch.\u201d\n\nFroud met his wife Wendy Froud, an artist, designer, and sculptor who helped create the look of Yoda for Empire Strikes Back, while working on The Dark Crystal. A few years later, their son Toby served as the toddler kidnapped by David Bowie in the 1986 film Labyrinth, another collaboration with Henson. Now an artist, filmmaker, animator, designer, and effects specialist, whose credits include extensive work with the stop-motion studio Laika, Toby talks about taking up the family business as an inevitability. \u201cI feel like I was born into it,\u201d Toby says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve always created puppets and costumes and my aesthetic sort just came naturally back to the Froudian field that my father and mother created.\u201d\n\nThat they\u2019d end up working together on a revival of The Dark Crystal, as they did on Age of Resistance, now looks almost as preordained. But making that family collaboration possible required a few false starts. In 2006, the Jim Henson Company CEO Lisa Henson, daughter of Jim, announced Power of the Dark Crystal, a sequel to be directed by acclaimed animator Genndy Tartakovsky, creator of Samurai Jack. \u201cI learned my lesson,\u201d Lisa Henson says, reflecting on the project. \u201cDon\u2019t ever talk about something at Comic Con unless you actually have the money to make it. Because the fans were very disappointed in us.\u201d\n\nAfter that project failed to launch, other ideas for sequels and prequels followed, as did a collaboration with Leterrier, who made plans to direct a new Dark Crystal feature film. Instead, thanks to Netflix\u2019s interest in a series made in the style of the original film, they created the ten-episode prequel, Age of Resistance.\n\nThe scale of Age of Resistance required developing new approaches to puppet performance.

The project also demanded developing new approaches to performance, as Dinnean discovered while bringing to life Brea, one of the series\u2019 protagonists, via a combination of old-fashioned puppetry and on-the-fly modifications of modern technology.\n\n\u201cI had a new type of performance with Brea where I had my own animatronic input device that I carried around with me,\u201d Dinnean says. \u201cI actually had a tiny computer that I wore on a belt with a battery, basically just a motherboard. They had hacked a video-game controller to go into this little motherboard and then back out came the cables that run the servos for Brea\u2019s eye blinks and eye movement. So I didn\u2019t have any control over her hands most of the time because my right hand was in her head and mouth and my left hand was running blinks and eye movement, which was great because I can sync those two things together. [\u2026] But there were times that I took my little input device and I just taped it to my arm rod and I had the hands as well. But that\u2019s \u2019cause I\u2019m a control freak.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Dinnean and the other puppeteers had to pull this off while watching their performances in monitors, the only way to see their puppets and play off the performances of the other puppeteers. \u201cThese characters, when they look at something, when they move through space, it\u2019s entirely an illusion,\u201d Dinnean says. \u201cIt\u2019s a magic trick. Oftentimes, if you look at them in real space, they\u2019re not looking at each other at all. Which is why it\u2019s hard to shoot two cameras at once on puppets. They could be looking directly past each other and it\u2019s quite obvious from one angle. [But] from the camera\u2019s angle, it looks like they\u2019re staring right into each other\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\nSuch complications required Leterrier, who also served as a camera operator alongside director of photography Erik Alexander Wilson, to make some adjustments as well, yet the dynamic camerawork recalls the director\u2019s human-populated features. \u201cI sort of retrofitted my camera and my camerawork and my tools to make it work for puppets. [\u2026] It has to be puppets, 100 percent puppets, but you have to forget you\u2019re watching puppets. I cannot do the typical puppet trick of having a foreground piece that always hides the bottom half of the body.\u201d To sell the illusion, he relied on some old-fashioned bits of movie magic. \u201cThere were normal techniques, funny techniques, little old techniques,\u201d Leterrier says. \u201cThe old stuff that you see in movies, [like] a stuntman rolling down and then up stands the actor.\u201d\n\nSeries director Louis Leterrier, who also served as a camera operator, had to retrofit his camerawork to make it work for puppets.

Puppets dominate Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, but it does feature some CG enhancements. \u201cSometimes something of a certain size would become CG, whether it was very tiny or very big,\u201d Henson says. The most common use of CG, however, came via the use of green screen, which allowed the series to open up its world. \u201cCG was used with parsimony to enhance the world, to widen the world up a little bit,\u201d Leterrier confirms. \u201cWe had to shoot everything on a stage and we had a stage that was a little short. Sometimes we had to extend the sky. That\u2019s what CG was used for. It was never used to replace anything.\u201d\n\nBy allowing for the erasure of puppeteers, green screen also proved useful in creating puppet characters that couldn\u2019t be realized in the original film, like Lore, a pile of animated rocks that has a special place in Brian Froud\u2019s heart. \u201cThe shapes and form of that character are precisely what Jim Henson saw when he first came to the landscape I live in so many years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted we\u2019ve created a character not only true to the spirit of the original film but true to the spirit of Jim Henson.\u201d As for the role green screen plays in making Lore come to life, he sees it as a high-tech form of a trick borrowed from Japanese bunraku puppetry, in which puppeteers make themselves invisible by performing against a black backdrop while wearing black robes.\n\nYet as easy as it is to explain how the puppets work, why they work remains something of a mystery, even to Brian Froud. \u201cI think there\u2019s something primal about human beings and our desire to invest the inanimate with life, especially things that we assemble and try to give our personality,\u201d he says. \u201cOur rational mind tells us it\u2019s just made out of stuff but our emotional body responds to something that seems to move and has a life beyond itself. There is something extraordinary, especially when watching the new series \u2026 You don\u2019t lose sight, ever, that they are puppets, but then they\u2019ll do something that catches you unawares because it\u2019s emotional. And it becomes a magical thing.\u201d", "description": "Netflix\u2019s 10-episode prequel to the 1982 Jim Henson/Frank Oz fantasy film expands the world of Thra via a combination of old-fashioned puppetry, modern technological modifications, and, yes, a little bit of CG.", "authors": ["Keith Phipps"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/dark-crystal/04-dark-crystal-bts-lede.w1200.h630.jpg"}
