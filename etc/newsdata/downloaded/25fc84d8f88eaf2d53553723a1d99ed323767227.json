A flood of progressive fans from independent supporter groups are fighting tooth and nail to show their support at stadiums for the violent Antifa movement, thrusting their fringe political beliefs onto a family-friendly fan base just looking to watch a competitive soccer match.\n\nFor weeks, tensions have grown. MLS does not allow the display of controversial and overtly-political symbols at matches, a clear violation of the Fan Code of Conduct. Despite the ban on the Iron Front flag - a symbol co-opted by Antifa to justify their violent attacks - fans in Seattle, Portland, Vancouver B.C., and Atlanta proudly displayed the symbol anyway.\n\nThey\u2019ve been told many times by the front offices of their clubs to stop bringing the flags and they\u2019re not happy.\n\nThe Fight\n\nThese fans legitimately think they\u2019re fighting Nazis in American cities.\n\nA Seattle Sounders independent fan group, Emerald City Supporters (ECS), fired off an angry and self-righteous statement: \u201cNo one should be oppressed or persecuted because of who they are. As with all things in life no one should feel they can\u2019t attend a soccer match and support the club they love. Just like the Iron Front symbol, the Emerald City Supporters stand for the oppressed and the persecuted.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Timbers Army, the fan club supporting the Portland Timbers, continued to fly the flags, even staging a 33 minute silent boycott during a pivotal match against their bitter rivals, the Sounders. The silence played towards the Sounders' favor, earning an early goal and eventual win. But these fans protesting to support Antifa don\u2019t care much about the teams, they care about their own political viewpoints.\n\nConsequently, several Timbers fans received three-game suspensions, according to ESPN. The Atlanta United supporters\u2019 group Resurgence saw nine members disciplined and in Vancouver B.C., a Whitecaps fan from the group Southsiders was given a warning for a violation.\n\nThe Context\n\nMLS teams in the Pacific Northwest have become known for their political activism, spending as much time professing their love of their teams as they do lecturing the public about their ideological views.\n\nSome groups are intentional in their identity. Gorilla FC, a Sounders fan group, actively calls itself Antifa. Some groups are traditional fan clubs, with leadership forcing political views on its members. None of these groups are especially measured or nuanced in their activism.\n\nThe 107 Independent Supporters Trust, the nonprofit group behind the Timbers Army and Rose City Riveters, declared in a statement: \u201cOur fight is against white nationalists, white supremacists, and others that seek to bring hate and violence to our stadium, city, state, and country.\u201d\n\nThese groups say the Iron Front flag isn\u2019t political, insisting it\u2019s about human rights. They are especially wrong, absolutely delusional and potentially dangerous.\n\nAntifa has a long history of illegal behavior, using violence to promote a political agenda. In Tacoma WA this summer, police shot and killed an Antifa member after they said he was throwing incendiary objects at an immigration detention center. In Portland, a group of Antifa thugs assaulted journalist Andy Ngo because they didn\u2019t like his reporting. And of course, we\u2019re familiar with their unhinged, violent tantrums in Berkeley.\n\nThese fans don\u2019t see much wrong with the violence. Antifa activists justify the dangerous behavior as simply fighting fascism and racism \u2014 positioning themselves as morally righteous. After all, they\u2019re the ones fighting literal Nazis. Only, they\u2019re not.\n\nCase in point: I\u2019m a talk show host in Seattle on KTTH. I was interested in this story because I\u2019m passionate about politics and soccer. I found this story interesting and when I first covered it, members of fan groups almost immediately labeled me a white supremacist and a Nazi, to intimidate me into not continuing my critical coverage.\n\nI\u2019m gay and Jewish. When an actual fascist or Nazi poses a threat, count me in for a fight. They\u2019re coming for me first, not some privileged, white dude that can afford season tickets to an MLS club.\n\nAntifa - and their enablers in these fan groups - categorize most political opponents as Nazis. They condemn most conservatives, from mainstream Republicans to Tea Partiers, as bigots. It\u2019s not that our beliefs are especially objectionable; it\u2019s that these activists object to any views they do not hold. Thus, they dehumanize political opposition, cast them off as Nazis, giving themselves justification to turn to violence to silence people with differing opinions.\n\nThe Implications\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how these fan groups will react, as we\u2019re nearing the end of the season. But they\u2019re pressuring the front offices of their organizations to work to rescind the bans on the politically controversial speech. These clubs - and the league - are in a tough position.\n\nThere is no doubt that these fan sections are active and lively. At their respective stadiums, they help create an exciting atmosphere, chanting, cheering, waving team flags, and unveiling amusing tifo displays. If they were to legitimately boycott games - as some have threatened - you would see it and feel it in these stadiums. Clubs have a reason to keep them happy and engaged.\n\nAt the same time, however, the MLS is interested in growing the league, expanding into new markets and better exposing the sport in the pre-existing markets. You\u2019re alienating a huge potential fan base with overtly political commentary -- regardless of whether it\u2019s a fringe Left position or fans simply waving a Betsy Ross flag (recently banned in Salt Lake at RSL games). We also know what injecting politics into sports can do for pre-existing fan bases. Look at what happened to the NFL.\n\nMy take? Keep your politics outside the stadiums. Politics divide; sports are supposed to unite. If you care about the sport, focus your attention on the team and the players. You betray your team support when diverting your attention, during a 90-minute game, to pursuing a fringe political belief. If you\u2019re really concerned with some kind of Nazi threat, it seems to me you\u2019d be better off not attending a game on a Sunday afternoon.", "description": "There\u2019s a war brewing between soccer fans and Major League .09/08/2019 7:36:27AM EST.", "authors": ["Jason Rantz", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/308/f9b4c0ae-7ec1-438e-8c96-7e33d05f3802.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
