From outside their new 'shed' had dark granite look with floor to ceiling windows - while it also had an unusual angle - which would allow light to enter the building in the morning - perfect for Lisa's sun salutations.\n\nThe new space was made up of two rooms - a living room, which can also be used as an office. Its minimalist design included white walls, a red sofa with throws and and a book case which was built into the wall.\n\nWhile next door was a garage and also storage space for bikes and Mikes drum kit.\n\nPresenter of the show Angela Scanlon and designer Laura both loved the new 'shed' - complimenting the final touches.

Talking about Robert's suggestion one said: 'The temple in the garden your home made perfect is just too much . Poor neighbours.\n\nWhile another said: 'Just caught a little bit of a BBC Two program called \u2018your home made perfect\u2019, where 2 architects compete using VR plan tech to design a garden room. The planner in me despairs. They do not appear to have considered the neighbours at all.'\n\n\n\nWhile another wasn't convinced with the finished product: 'Watching Your Home Made Perfect. Usually they implement the amazing designs really well but thought this week\u2019s implementation was a bit half-hearted.'", "description": "Mike and Lisa, from Shewsbury, who appeared on BBC 2's Your Home Made Perfect, last night said that they wanted space to spend more quality time together as a family.", "authors": ["Sarah Finley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/09/20121664-0-image-a-23_1571905840167.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
