REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nTORONTO (Reuters) - The cast and crew of \u2018Hustlers,\u2019 a movie about strippers in New York City, hit the red carpet for the film\u2019s premiere at the Toronto Film Festival on Saturday, and their main message was the empowering experience of working on a female-led project.\n\n\u2018Hustlers\u2019 stars Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu, Keke Palmer, Cardi B and with a cameo from Lizzo. It follows a group of dancers at a strip club in New York City, who come up with a less-than-legal way of making money from their Wall Street customers after the stock market crash of 2008 dries up their regular incomes.\n\nBased on a true story, the film was written, directed and produced by women.\n\n\u201cYou know how moms become superheroes to their kids? That\u2019s how it was\u201d on set, Palmer said. \u201cNot saying that guys can\u2019t get stuff done, but women really be getting all the stuff done.\u201d\n\nTo Wu, the female leadership in creating the movie was made all the more important given the subject matter.\n\nThe strippers are people \u201cwho society has judged and marginalized, and we got the opportunity to humanize their stories,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest potential of art.\u201d\n\nThe humanization of the strippers as characters was crucial to director Lorene Scafaria.\n\n\u201cThat was the whole idea of it from the beginning, to just show that this is a job like anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are people trying to make ends meet and pay the bills... Of course it turns into a crime trauma, but I think it\u2019s important to just see where they started from actually.\u201d", "description": "The cast and crew of 'Hustlers,' a movie about strippers in New York City, hit the red carpet for the film's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival on Saturday, and their main message was the empowering experience of working on a female-led project.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427479467&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8704E", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
