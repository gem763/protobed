According to the law, Netanyahu would have to resign when indicted if he held a lower post.\n\nWhat they're saying: In a statement he published after returning the mandate to Rivlin, Netanyahu blamed Gantz for not agreeing to form a unity government. Netanyahu stressed that if Gantz tries to form a minority government with the support of the Arab-Israeli parties, he will fight against him as leader of the opposition.\n\nGantz issued a statement in response calling Netanyahu\u2019s accusations \"spin.\" Gantz said that once he gets the mandate from Rivlin \u2014 which will likely happen at the end of the week \u2014 he will immediately start negotiating with the different parties to form \"a liberal unity government.\"\n\nThe big picture: This is the first time this has happened since October 2008, when Tzipi Livni, then the chairman of the Kadima party, failed to form a coalition and had to return the mandate to then-President Shimon Peres. Since then, Netanyahu has been the only politician to receive the mandate.\n\nNetanyahu received the mandate to form a government six times in his long political career. Four times, including in his first term in 1996, he successfully managed to form a government.\n\nThe main significance of the mandate moving to Gantz is psychological. It breaks the concept that has taken root in the Israeli political system that Netanyahu is a political magician, invincible coalition builder and forever prime minister.\n\nYes, but: Gantz doesn\u2019t have a 61-member majority in the Knesset yet and will have difficulties forming a coalition. It's likely that in 28 days, Gantz will give the mandate back to Rivlin, who will then have another 21 days to consult with the different factions to try to find a solution. If no solution is reached, Israel will have its third election of the year.\n\nThis is breaking news.
