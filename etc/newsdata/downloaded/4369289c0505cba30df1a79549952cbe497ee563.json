After all, we need the latter to survive.\n\nThe answer, of course, is scarcity, a concept at the core of economics. Diamonds are rare and water literally falls from the sky. Were there no scarcity, we wouldn\u2019t need economics. But given that scarcity exists, we have a price system to signal the economic value of stuff \u2014 how much of it there is and how badly we want it.\n\nAnd yet, there\u2019s a key area where prices fail us every day. They fail us every time you fill up your gas tank: Fossil fuels are severely underpriced.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? I mean that fossil fuels are imposing costs on our environment, our economy, and our future that are not being captured by their price.\n\nThat underpricing has consequences. Energy costs are so low and so unresponsive to the environmental challenge we face that they send us a signal to literally keep cruising along, ignoring the pressing reality of climate change.\n\nHow is it that a discipline fundamentally based on scarcity has failed to accurately price in the damage we\u2019re doing to our most important, scarce resource: the environment? Naomi Klein writes that the climate crisis is \u201cborn of the central fiction on which our economic model is based: that nature is limitless.\u201d\n\nBut I don\u2019t think the economic model fails because it denies scarcity and embraces limitless nature. It fails because of its interaction with two things in particular: 1) our tendency to focus on the present at the expense of the future; and 2) the toxic cycle of profit and influence that distorts policy making and blocks the accurate pricing of carbon.\n\nThis diagnosis matters because we need to either unjam the model and attach a sustainable price on carbon or recognize that politics as currently practiced won\u2019t allow us to do that, in which case we\u2019ll need to figure out other, bolder ways to fight climate change. The Green New Deal may well play a role in that alternative vision.\n\nWhen price sends the wrong signal\n\nOne can\u2019t overestimate the centrality of price signaling in market economics. The work of two of the most towering figures in the field \u2014 Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman \u2014 was largely premised on respecting the information in market-formed price signals and critiquing government actions that allegedly distorted such signals. In this framework, minimum wages, for example, are a huge problem as they distort/inflate the price of low-wage labor. Taxes on wages or capital similarly distort behaviors to work and invest.\n\nBut the real world shows the theory has often been found wanting. There are literally hundreds of places, both here and abroad, where minimum wages appear to have little distortionary effects on labor markets. Most recently, Trump\u2019s big tax cut for the rich hasn\u2019t led to anything close to the investment boom its proponents promised. To be sure, most card-carrying economists, myself included, still believe prices convey useful information. It\u2019s just that a ton of empirical research reveals that life is a lot more complicated than the simple theory suggests.\n\nWhen it comes to the environment in general and fossil fuels in particular, the price system isn\u2019t merely failing to work. It\u2019s sending wrong signals, and fatefully so. This is not because fossil fuels themselves are scarce. It\u2019s because their price fails to reflect their contribution to global warming. One recent study put the gap between what fossil fuels (not just gas, of course) do cost and what they should cost, given the environmental damage they inflict, at over $5 trillion, or more than 6 percent of global GDP, per year.\n\nOver the last decade, energy costs grew on an annual basis at a mere 1.4 percent, a touch slower than overall prices, which were up 1.5 percent per year. Last month, the average price of a gallon of gas was $2.59; 10 years prior, in September 2009, that price \u2014 in nominal terms \u2014 was an almost identical $2.55.\n\nHow can that be? Given the increasing awareness of the urgency of climate change over the past 10 years, fossil fuel costs should be higher and they should be growing faster than overall prices, signaling their contribution to global warming.\n\nWhy is the price system failing so miserably in such an important facet of our lives and our children\u2019s lives?\n\nDiscounting the future\n\nOne hint to the answer is embedded in that phrase: \u201cour children.\u201d Whenever you hear a plea made on behalf of a future concern \u2014 or, in the case of climate, a present concern that is expected to worsen as time proceeds \u2014 recognize that you\u2019re bumping up hard against our unfortunate bias toward the present.\n\nIn some ways, discounting the future makes sense. A dollar a year from now will have less buying power than a dollar today because of inflation.\n\nThat\u2019s how too many of us appear to think about the future of the environment. And by so doing, we\u2019re unmotivated to spend more now to stave off destruction later, a preference expressed in the resistance of policy makers and elected officials to enact policies to fight climate change.\n\nSixteen-year-old Greta Thunberg put not too fine a point on this shortcoming in her speech to the United Nations last month: \u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!\u201d\n\nThose \u201cfairy tales\u201d to which Thunberg refers are often told by long-term economic projections that typically leave out the costs of climate change. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) recently upbraided the Congressional Budget Office for suggesting the economic impact of climate change would be \u201csmall\u201d or \u201cmodest\u201d in coming decades. The CBO responded by pointing out that relative to GDP growth, damage estimates over the next few decades look pretty small, though it admitted that \u201ceven if the economic costs are modest 50 or 60 years from now, they may no longer be modest 80 or 90 years from now.\u201d\n\nThere are, of course, cost estimates that could get us to dial back our tendency to discount the future. A 2006 report from the United Kingdom predicted that \u201cif we don\u2019t act, the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global GDP each year, now and forever,\u201d with the largest burden falling on poor countries. A recent and, given its source, somewhat miraculous example is a report from the Trump administration\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency warning of significant losses to hours of work, heat-related deaths, property loss, destruction of roads, rail, bridges, and so on, valued at over $200 billion per year, by the end of this century.\n\nBut while these studies garner headlines for a few days, they\u2019ve changed neither our proclivity to discount future threats nor the prices of fossil fuels.\n\nWhen polluters buy politicians\n\nSo, market-driven price signals aren\u2019t working, and our bias for the present is part of the problem. Still, under the rubric of \u201cmarket failures,\u201d contemporary economics should be equipped to deal with this type of a short circuit.\n\nThat is, when markets and people interact in ways that are harmful for human welfare, there\u2019s a well-established economic rationale for the government to step in and fix the problem by \u201cinternalizing the externality,\u201d meaning making the persons or institutions that are, in this case, polluting the environment pay for the damage they\u2019re doing to the rest of us. If the price system isn\u2019t picking up the true cost of the damage and short-sighted people \u2014 which is most of us \u2014 are okay with that, then there\u2019s a role for government to realign the higher social cost of fossil fuels with its lower actual cost.\n\nAnd yet, this realignment has yet to occur. Why not?\n\nPart of the explanation is the toxic intersection of capitalism and money in politics. As the great fortunes of those in energy extraction industries show, capitalism creates a lucrative platform from which to profit from the failure of price signals today and our unwillingness to worry enough about tomorrow.\n\nBy itself, that wouldn\u2019t be enough to protect the capitalists from government action to make them internalize the damage they\u2019re imposing on the world. But when you add in the final ingredient \u2014 the fact that we have more private money in politics than any other advanced economy \u2014 you can see why we\u2019re in this increasingly hot mess.\n\nIs this fixable?\n\nThere is no analytical solution to this set of problems. More accurate estimates of the costs and their timing are surely useful but they will not fix the price signals or get people to react with requisite urgency.\n\nThe solution must be political \u2014 and it is here where there\u2019s some hope.\n\nGood, socially minded economists, even Nobel laureates, have argued for pricing carbon more accurately, but thus far they\u2019ve been ignored. Clearly, a different approach is necessary. Which is why we really should take the Green New Deal seriously.\n\nThe GND potentially works precisely because it does not try to hit the problem head-on. It doesn\u2019t adjust price signals by taxing carbon or try to convince people that there\u2019s a big problem out there beyond their discounting horizon.\n\nInstead, the GND puts action against climate change in an immediate and broad social justice context that recognizes the urgency of present needs \u2014 better jobs (many in green sectors, a way in which action on climate can be pro-growth, for the record) and health care \u2014 while plotting an ambitious course to 100 percent renewable and emission-free electricity in the relatively near future.\n\nThis is not the place to debate the viability of the GND\u2019s goals. It is, of course, possible that the well-resourced politics that has blocked everything else so far will be able to block the GND\u2019s initiatives, too.\n\nBut what I take from the above analysis \u2014 from the broken price signals, future discounting, and corrupt politics that have heretofore blocked the path forward \u2014 is that something big, different, and oriented toward both future crises and present injustices is required. This is what it will take to override the powerful forces jamming the economic model and, in so doing, reveal the true scarcity of our natural resources and the sustainable path to preserve them.\n\nJared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and was the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden from 2009 to 2011.", "description": "Our economic model fails to explain how we got here on climate.
