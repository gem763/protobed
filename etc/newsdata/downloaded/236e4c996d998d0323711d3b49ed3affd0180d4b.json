(AP Photo/Jeffrey McWhorter)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As President Donald Trump describes it, the U.S. swooped into an intractable situation in the Middle East, achieved an agreement within hours that had eluded the world for years and delivered a \"great day for civilization.\"\n\nIt was a mission-accomplished moment that other Republican leaders, Democrats and much of the world found unconvincing.\n\nTrump spent much of the past week trying to justify his decision to pull U.S. troops away from America's Kurdish allies in Syria, leaving those Kurdish fighters vulnerable on several fronts and already reeling from attacks by Turkish forces.\n\nIn the process, Trump exaggerated the scope of a deal bringing a temporary cease-fire to Turkish-Kurdish hostilities, falsely suggested that U.S. troops in Syria will come home and mischaracterized the history of the conflict and even the geography of it.\n\nA look at his rhetoric on that topic and other subjects over the past week as well as a sampling of statements from the latest Democratic presidential debate:\n\nSYRIA\n\nTRUMP: \"It's time to bring our soldiers back home.\" \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's not what he's doing.\n\nWhile the U.S. has begun what the Pentagon calls a deliberate withdrawal of troops from Syria, Trump himself has said that the 200 to 300 U.S. service members deployed to a southern Syria outpost in Al-Tanf will remain there.\n\nAnd on Saturday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the current plan calls for all U.S. troops who are leaving Syria to go to western Iraq, not home. They number more than 700.\n\nAsked Sunday why troops weren't coming home as Trump said they would, his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said: \"Well, they will eventually.\"\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \"This is a great day for civilization. I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path. People have been trying to make this 'Deal\" for many years. Millions of lives will be saved. Congratulations to ALL!\" \u2014 tweet Thursday.\n\nTRUMP: \"A lot of things are in that agreement that nobody ever thought possible.\" \u2014 remarks at Dallas rally Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The agreement he is hailing is not nearly as consequential to the prospects for peace as he claims. It provides for s five-day cease-fire in the Turks' deadly attacks on Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, which began after Trump announced he would withdraw U.S. troops.\n\nThe agreement requires the Kurds to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border in an arrangement that codifies nearly all of Turkey's stated goals in the conflict and relieves it of U.S. sanctions.\n\nIt imposes no apparent long-term consequences for Turkey's move against the Kurds, important U.S. partners in the fight against the Islamic State group. Trump calls that fight a mission accomplished despite the U.S. officials' fears of an IS resurgence.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on the Syrian areas of Turkish-Kurdish conflict: \"It's a lot of sand. They've got a lot of sand over there. So there's a lot of sand that they can play with.\" \u2014 remarks Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The area of conflict is not known for being particularly sandy. In contrast to Trump's imagery of arid, worthless land that other countries \u2014 not the U.S. \u2014 should fight over, it's actually the breadbasket of Syria.\n\nThe area is part of what was historically known as the Fertile Crescent, where settled farming and early civilizations first began.\n\n__\n\nTRUMP: \"We were supposed to be in Syria for one month. That was 10 years ago.\" \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Previous administrations never set a one-month timeline for U.S. involvement in Syria.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition began airstrikes on Islamic State militants in Syria in September 2014. About a year later, the Pentagon said teams of special operations forces began going into Syria to conduct raids and start efforts to partner with the Kurdish forces.\n\nThen-Defense Secretary Ash Carter made it clear to Congress at that time that the Pentagon was ready to expand operations with the Kurds and would continue to do so as needed to battle IS, without setting a specific deadline.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \"Our soldiers are mostly gone from the area.\" \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: They're mostly still there.\n\nClose to 30 U.S. troops moved out of two outposts near the border area where the Turkish attack was initially centered. But the bulk of the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops deployed to Syria are still in the country.", "description": "Trump spent much of the past week trying to justify his decision to pull U.S. troops away from America's Kurdish allies in Syria, leaving those Kurdish fighters vulnerable on several fronts and already reeling from attacks by Turkish forces.
