The video and the Facebook account of the person who posted the video have since been made unavailable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got immigration on my ass,\u201d the alleged human smuggler can be heard telling his \u201ctio\u201d (uncle) in a cell phone conversation. \u201cI\u2019ve got immigration on my ass because I have ten guys with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to do me a huge favor and not tell anyone,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m in a f*cking sh*thole fight now. Could you go open the ranch gate so that I can drive in super fast and close the gate so I can lose them?\u201d\n\nHe explained that Border Patrol vehicles were about a mile behind him at the time.\n\nHis uncle apparently responded that he was in town and no one was at the ranch to open the gate. \u201cF*ck,\u201d the alleged smuggler responded.\n\n\u201cI am going to save these vatos (men) and I\u2019m going to save my ass,\u201d he concluded before hanging up. Earlier in the video, he could be heard calling his father and telling him \u201cI love you\u201d as if saying goodbye.\n\nAt one point, the female passenger (also reported to be a human smuggler) claimed the vehicle was doing \u201c160.\u201d That speed in kilometers per hour converts to about 100 mph.\n\nAt one point, the alleged smuggler tells the woman, \u201cWe\u2019re jumping, we\u2019re running, we\u2019re leaving the car.\u201d\n\nShortly after the alleged smuggler says goodbye to his uncle, he appears to drive the vehicle off the roadway at a high speed. The vehicle comes to a stop and everyone bails out of the vehicle. The woman continues the video as she runs through the brush. Police sirens can be heard approaching the scene about a minute after the bailout.\n\nSheriff\u2019s office deputies in Zapata County, Texas, initiated a vehicle pursuit on a vehicle suspected to be smuggling a group of migrants on Friday, U.S. Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza told Breitbart Texas in his role as Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC). Texas Department of Public Safety troopers backed up the deputies during the pursuit, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen Border Patrol agents arrived on the scene of the bailout, they conducted a search and apprehended the driver and passenger along with several aliens,\u201d Garza told Breitbart Texas in a phone interview.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis video shows the real danger these human smuggling pursuits present,\u201d Garza continued. \u201cFortunately, this one ended safely but we see way too many where innocent civilian bystanders are injured or killed in crashes involving these smugglers.\u201d\n\nGarza said agents in his sector have seen an increase in the number of pursuits as more migrants are shifting from a strategy of turning themselves in at the border to attempt to avoid apprehension and detention.\n\n\u201cYou can hear the fear in the voices of the people pleading to be let out as the vehicle reached speeds around 100 mph,\u201d Garza stated. \u201cMany times, these types of pursuits end in crashes, or worse yet, vehicle rollovers where the migrants are severely injured or killed.\u201d\n\nIn June 2018, Border Patrol agents in the Del Rio Sector engaged in a pursuit of a human smuggler with 14 people crammed into a Chevrolet Tahoe, Breitbart Texas reported. Dimmit County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies took over the pursuit which ended after the driver lost control while entering the town of Big Wells, Texas. The vehicle rolled several times ejecting 12 of the 14 people on board. At least four migrants died at the scene and a fifth died at a San Antonio hospital from injuries sustained in the crash.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen an increase in the strategy of packing human cargo into big-rig trailers,\u201d Garza continued. \u201cThis appears to be happening as more OTMs (Other Than Mexican) migrants are returned to Mexico under the MPP policy. As the migrants figure out they can\u2019t just arrive and stay, they begin to seek more traditional human smuggling tactics to get into the country.\u201d\n\nBreitbart Texas reports extensively on the human smuggling activities in South Texas and Arizona involving tractor-trailer rigs with human cargo.\n\nBreitbart Texas reached out to Laredo Sector Border Patrol and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials for an official statement on the vehicle pursuit. Officials promised a response that has not yet been received.", "description": "A Facebook Live video appears to capture several minutes of a vehicle pursuit where an alleged human smuggler with ten migrants evades police.", "authors": ["Bob Price"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/human-smuggler-pursuit-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
