In mid-September, the health minister said the government had investigated two recent cases of unknown illnesses, but they tested negative for Ebola.", "description": "The United States has warned its citizens to take extra care when visiting Tanzania\u00a0amid concerns over Ebola, adding to calls for the East African country to share information about suspected cases of the deadly disease there.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434838160&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R08R-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
