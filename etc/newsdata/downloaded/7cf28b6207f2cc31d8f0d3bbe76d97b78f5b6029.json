Valuable workers flee to cheaper cities. People end up living on the streets. Rent control is a relatively quick way for lawmakers to take action as tensions rise.\n\nGo deeper: Curbed LA has more details about the new law, including its exemptions.", "description": "California is the 3rd state in 2019 to increase rent controls.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/n_YDPSVNHssu8zTGItOT30XImhs=/0x41:803x493/1920x1080/2019/10/09/1570645710546.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
