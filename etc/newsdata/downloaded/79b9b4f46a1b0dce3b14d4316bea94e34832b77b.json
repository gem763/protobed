Coach Gregg Popovich praised the NBA Commissioner for standing up for free speech, but didn\u2019t say anything about the subject that launched this entire firestorm, i.e. freedom in Hong Kong. Similarly, Steph Curry dodged a question about the topic saying he didn\u2019t know enough to speak about it.\n\nToday, there\u2019s a clip circulating of NBA stars James Harden and Russel Westbrook, who are in Japan for a preseason game, being asked about the controversy by a CNN reporter. \u201cThe NBA has always been a league that prides itself on its players and its coaches being able to speak out openly about political and societal affairs,\u201d Christina Macfarlane said. She continued, \u201cI just wonder after the events of this week and the fallout we\u2019ve seen whether you would both feel differently about speaking out in that way in the future?\u201d\n\nAt that point, some NBA minder at the press conference speaks up: \u201cExcuse me, we\u2019re taking basketball questions only.\u201d Why hasn\u2019t anyone said that when Popovich is winding up on gun control?\n\nSomeone else immediately comes to take the mic away from Macfarlane. There\u2019s some crosstalk as she argues that she\u2019s asking a legitimate question that hasn\u2019t been answered, but the real payoff to this clip comes when the camera cuts back to Harden and Westbrook. Both are sitting in front of microphones and obediently saying nothing as the question hangs in the air. The NBA is not talking about politics suddenly. Not a word.\n\nI don\u2019t think there can be any doubt about what is happening here. Everyone involved has been told\u2014maybe warned is a better word\u2014not to say anything about China or Hong Kong. So while the NBA commissioner is being praised by coach Popovich for standing up for free speech, the word has been sent down internally that no one better say nothing about nothing. And just like that, all the woke truth-tellers in the NBA are silent.\n\nI\u2019m sure the NBA will find a way out of this mess eventually, probably after conferring with a high-priced crisis communications firm in Washington, DC, but at the moment this continues to look like a week-long car wreck. I couldn\u2019t be happier about that. A league that has been as smug as this one has about woke politics genuinely deserves this head-on collision with its own hypocrisy.", "description": "\"a league that prides itself on its players and its coaches being able to speak out openly\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NBA-press-conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
