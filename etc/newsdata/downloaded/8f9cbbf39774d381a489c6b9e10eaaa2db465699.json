With days to go before the opening, there is still no sign of whether one of the major works will appear.\n\nThe Louvre\u2019s vast Leonardo da Vinci exhibition to mark 500 years since the death of the Italian Renaissance master will finally open next week as the world\u2019s most-visited museum prepares to handle a huge influx of visitors.\n\nOne of the most expensive exhibitions ever staged in France, it is the first time that such a large number of Leonardo\u2019s drawings, sketches, writings and paintings have ever been brought together.\n\nBut a question mark still hangs over whether Salvator Mundi \u2014 the world\u2019s most expensive painting \u2014 will be loaned. Mystery surrounds who owns the painting, a depiction of Jesus in Renaissance dress, which was once thought to be held in the Gulf. Unusually, the exhibition space has been designed to accommodate pictures arriving or being refused at the last minute. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been in this situation before,\u201d a museum representative said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leonardo da Vinci exhibition at the Louvre. Photograph: Antoine Mongodin\n\nLeonardo, whose life has been a constant source of myth-making, is considered a visionary genius \u2013 a painter, scientist, engineer and inventor. Born the illegitimate son of a notary in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci in 1452, the Italian humanist worked in Florence and Milan, and spent his final years at the court of the French king Francis I in the Loire, where he died on 2 May 1519. Since then what is known on his life has been pored over and seized upon; his vegetarianism and interest in animal welfare have been cited by French anti-hunting groups while the androgynous faces in many of his portraits are considered by some as a modern questioning of gender.\n\nAt the heart of the Louvre\u2019s exhibition are the lessons that can be learned about Leonardo\u2019s personality from the awe-inspiring realism in his work: portraits such as La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re, the Mona Lisa or his depiction of Saint John the Baptist.\n\nLeonardo painted relatively little \u2013 there are only about 15 remaining paintings \u2013 of which nine are in this show. He worked painstakingly slowly, often spending more than a decade on a painting. The exhibition includes many of his outstanding drawings. The curators argue that his interest in science \u2013 particularly astronomy, botany and his constant grappling with mathematical problems \u2013 was not a digression that pulled him away from art, but was central to his quest to achieve perfection in his painting.\n\n\u201cHe had an ability not just to depict things from the outside, but to also show what was inside: the movement and vibration of life, the inner emotions,\u201d said Louis Frank, one of the show\u2019s curators.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Portrait of Leonardo da Vinci.

The temporary exhibition space devoted to the Leonardo show can only accommodate 7,000 people per day and the museum did not want to prevent other visitors seeing it. There will also be a virtual reality experience of the Mona Lisa for the first time. As the Louvre faces ever higher visitor numbers, the Leonardo exhibition will only be open to people who have pre-booked.\n\nThe whole exhibition was in danger last year when Leonardo was dragged into a long-running political spat between Italy\u2019s then far-right ruling League party and France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron. Italy said it would cancel the loan of some paintings, accusing France of trying to take centre stage in the commemorations marking 500 years since the painter\u2019s death. \u201cLeonardo is Italian; he only died in France,\u201d one far-right MP said.\n\nThe row was finally resolved but then a last-minute legal challenge this month nearly stopped da Vinci\u2019s Vitruvian Man \u2013 a study in anatomical proportions \u2013 from appearing. An Italian heritage group said the drawing, which is kept in a climate-controlled vault at the Accademia Gallery of Venice, was too fragile to travel and risked being damaged by lighting in the Louvre if displayed for a long period. A court ruled the work could travel. It is currently in transit, and will arrive next week to be shown for a limited period.\n\nVincent Delieuvin, one of the show\u2019s curators, said the exhibition would explain how Leonardo established that the secret to creating perfect paintings that laid bare human nature was to capture light, shade and movement. For Leonardo, it was about opening one\u2019s mind to \u201can absolute freedom\u201d in drawing and painting, Delieuvin said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Louvre will host works of Italian artist after long-running political spats and legal battles", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0b940af876b1c291600d7ac6d3b5eda3e632077/0_80_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=26d41302882d0bd61b1cb4229a869cb9", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
