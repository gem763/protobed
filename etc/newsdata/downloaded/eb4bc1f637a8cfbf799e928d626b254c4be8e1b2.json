This development had been reported to then-senior National Security Council (NSC) leadership.\n\nAccording to Fox:\n\nThe development comes as Fiona Hill, a former special assistant to the president who worked on European and Russian affairs, is set to give a deposition next week. Fox News has reached out to Hill for over a week with questions about whether she helped prep for the July 25 call or received any readout of the call. Hill departed the White House in July, after working under ex-National Security Advisers H.R. McMaster and John Bolton.\n\nSeparately, President Trump\u2019s new National Security Advisor, Robert O\u2019Brien, appeared on Fox Business News\u2019 Lou Dobbs on Thursday and said he plans to reduce the number of staff members of the National Security Council over the next 15 months to about 100 from the current level of 178. O\u2019Brien said that the Obama administration had over 200 staffers on its NSC while the George W. Bush administration had only 100. He told Dobbs that, \u201cIt just ballooned into a massive, you know, bureaucracy\u2026under the last administration. We want to bring it back to historic levels. We think we can be more efficient and better serve the President with that sort of a streamlined organization.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien said the cuts would happen through attrition. He explained that \u201cmost of them are detailed from agencies, from the DOD, from various branches of the military, from the State Department.\u201d\n\nConsidering that the most recent leak from an NSC staffer resulted in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint which has become the basis of the Democrats\u2019 bogus impeachment inquiry, Trump is obviously concerned.\n\nHowever, a senior administration official said Friday that O\u2019Brien\u2019s planned staff reduction was unrelated to the leaks. That seems rather unlikely. A smaller staff would be in the administration\u2019s best interest as it would make members a bit more accountable and leakers somewhat easier to find.\n\nOn Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys asked lawmakers if, instead of appearing before Congress in person, their client might answer questions in writing. So far, there has been no response.\n\nTheir source said the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys fear that Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee would leak their client\u2019s identity.\n\nSeveral ideas have been tossed around about how to protect the whistleblower\u2019s anonymity such as having him or her \u201cappear remotely and using technology like voice modulation software to conceal his identity.\u201d\n\nOther ideas involve the use of secure rooms called Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, or SCIFs. The source said that \u201cwhile those rooms are available on Capitol Hill, appearing there likely would pose additional challenges to protecting the whistleblower\u2019s anonymity given the number of people, especially reporters, in the halls of Congress. One alternative that has been discussed is using a SCIF at an executive branch agency, people familiar with the matter said.\u201d\n\nGiven how significantly the whistleblower\u2019s case has unraveled over the last couple of weeks, I think we should dispense with the term \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d Like Christine Blasey-Ford, he or she is a tool of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 protection of this individual stands in sharp contrast to their Stalinesque treatment of the President. Even the accused have rights in the U.S. justice system. The Confrontation Clause in the Sixth Amendment \u201cprovides that a person accused of a crime has the right to confront a witness against him or her\u2026as well as the right to cross-examine the prosecution\u2019s witnesses.\u201d House Democrats have accused our President of an offense that falls into the category of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d He is entitled to a defense and he deserves to confront his accuser.\n\n(Relevant segment begins at 3:55.)", "description": "NSC Staffer is Revealed as Whistleblower\u2019s Likely Informant; White House Decides to Cut NSC Staff", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Sister Toldjah", "Nick Arama", "Alex Parker", "C.
