Shaw, the $50 billion hedge fund that in recent years has engaged in shareholder activism along with its many other disciplines, released a voluminous report on Tuesday outlining all the ways it says Emerson Electric has failed shareholders over the last decade.\n\nThe report, obtained by CNBC ahead of its release, starts a campaign to bring significant change to the industrial giant, including asking it to split its industrial automation business from its climate technology business. D.E. Shaw also calls for a significant effort to cut costs.\n\nThe report, which also confirms that D.E. Shaw has a more than 1% position in Emerson Electric, is the funds first public utterance since the reports of its potential activism first surfaced.\n\nEmerson's stock price, which has already responded to stories of D.E. Shaw's potential activism, was up slightly Tuesday.\n\nThe report offers a searing indictment of Emerson's long time chief executive officer David Farr and of its board of directors, who have presided over a significant shortfall in total shareholder return over the last three, five and 10 years when measured against Emerson's peers in the automation or HVAC industries not to mention a 10-year lag of 120% vs. the S&P 500.\n\nD.E. Shaw focuses on what it says is a history of poor capital allocation by the company since Farr took over as CEO. Since 2000, Emerson has spent nearly $14 billion of capital when accounting for mergers and acquisitions and capital expenditures but has only increased its earnings by $400 million over that period when accounting for its capex. The resulting 3% pretax return on incremental capital severely lags almost every one of its peers, which post an average return of 11.4% during the same period. One culprit for those poor returns on capital, D.E. Shaw maintains, is a cost structure that includes the highest level of selling, general and administrative expenses relative to sales among its peers and the lowest revenue per employee versus those competitors and a broader universe of industrial companies.", "description": "The activist hedge fund releases a voluminous report outlining all the ways it says Emerson Electric failed shareholders over the last decade.", "authors": ["David Faber"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105490995-1538765206905img_8212.jpg?v=1571145726", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
