U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI)\n\nfutures was up 28 cents, or 0.5%, to $56.03 a barrel.\n\nThe rise came after China moved to exempt some U.S.\n\nanti-cancer drugs and other goods from tariffs and U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced a delay to scheduled tariff\n\nhikes on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods.\n\nThe concessions preceded a planned meeting in coming days\n\naimed at defusing the trade row between the world's two largest\n\neconomies. \"The postponement of the next round of China tariffs by\n\nPresident Trump ... has the global growth story back in full\n\nswing,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.\n\nThat said, \"further rallies in Asia look limited today\"\n\nahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) rate review, he said.\n\nThe ECB meets later on Thursday and is expected to ease\n\npolicy to support flagging growth.

EIA/S\n\n\"Historical inventory patterns suggest that stocks should\n\nbegin to hit seasonal bottom sometime in the next two-three\n\nweeks,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at\n\nAxiTrader.\n\nCrude inventories USOILC=ECI fell for a fourth week,\n\nfalling 6.9 million barrels in the week to Sept. 6 - more than\n\ndouble analysts' expectations of a 2.7 million-barrel drawdown.\n\n\n\nAt 416.1 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories were at\n\ntheir lowest since October 2018, and about 2% below the\n\nfive-year average for this time of year, the EIA said.\n\nCrude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub\n\nUSOICC=ECI fell 798,000 barrels to 39.3 million barrels, their\n\nlowest since November 2018.\n\nRefinery crude runs USOICR=ECI rose by 114,000 bpd, EIA\n\ndata showed.
