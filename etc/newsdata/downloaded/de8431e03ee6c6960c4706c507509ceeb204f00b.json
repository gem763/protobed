Some want to know how to get started in stocks while also diversifying using crypto to profit from both markets.\n\nToday we\u2019re going to bust the myth claiming that cryptocurrencies are completely uncorrelated instruments and we\u2019ll also share a few essential pieces of advice that might be useful.\n\nRisk sentiment drives them both\n\nAlthough cryptocurrencies are only 11 years old, they share a lot in common with stocks, if we talk about longer-term performance. Both crypto and stocks are instruments with low liquidity and high volatility, meaning the global risk sentiment heavily influences their price behavior.\n\nBesides the first months of 2019, the last time we saw a significant bull run in cryptocurrencies was the second half of 2017. What did the stock markets do? They were making new record highs. The first half of 2019 had also been productive for most of the large-cap cryptocurrencies, while stocks around the globe recovered from a slump of December 2018.\n\nExpectancy and investing behavior\n\nThe bigger potential returns are motivating most of the investors attracted to volatile instruments. Even though both cryptocurrencies and stocks could produce unexpected results in short periods, professional investors must be able to put both risk and the potential return in the balance.\n\nHunting for opportunities that generate returns in a few hours or days could be an exhausting process, which is why it\u2019s much better to find opportunities that could last something between a few weeks to few months. Trying to find broader market moves will give you much more time to analyze the situation from different angles and make informed decisions.\n\nParticular challenges in crypto investing\n\nIf you want to get involved in the cryptocurrency industry, you\u2019ll need to be aware of some of the harmful consequences. Unfortunately, due to low liquidity and the lack of regulation, cryptocurrencies are still instrumenting subject to price manipulation. In this case, learning how to read price action and understand the market order flow will be essential in spotting situations where your ideas are wrong.\n\nAlso, investing in crypto using traditional exchange platforms may bring some negative consequences (hacking risks, lack of regulation, etc.) which is why most of the investors willing to invest larger amounts have moved to futures contracts trading on the CME, or other cryptocurrency-related derivatives.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is trading seven days a week, and as we\u2019ve seen in the past year, major price movements are happening on Sundays, when liquidity is very low, and some market participants can influence the price meaningfully. As a result, you\u2019ll need to allocate a few hours during the weekend as well, to be up-to-date with all the latest developments.\n\nLastly, don\u2019t forget to continually be aware of the difference between value and price, since this is the biggest trap beginners fall into, as their subjective thinking clouds what should be a detached and objective view of the market conditions.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "Since cryptocurrencies proved to be investing instruments able to generate returns, a lot of people currently trading stocks are thinking to add them in", "authors": ["Danish Yasin", "View All Posts Danish Yasin", "About The Author", "A Freelance Writer With More Than Three Years Of Experience", "Can Write Research Papers", "Blogs", "Web Articles.
