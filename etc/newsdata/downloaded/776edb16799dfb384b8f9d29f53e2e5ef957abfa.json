It forecast for the U.S. economy dropped by two-tenths of a percentage point to 2.4 percent annual growth in 2019. China\u2019s forecast was lowered one-tenth of a percentage point to 6.1 percent. Japan was left unchanged at the already low level of 0.9 percent growth. Europe was cut one-tenth of a percentage point to 1.2 percent.\n\n\u201cGrowth continues to be weakened by rising trade barriers and increasing geopolitical tensions,\u201d said Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s chief economist.\u201dWe estimate that the US-China trade tensions will cumulatively reduce the level of global GDP by 0.8 percent by 2020.\u201d\n\nThe IMF said it projects \u201ca modest improvement\u201d in global growth to 3.4 percent in 2020, faster growth than it expects this year but two-tenths of a percentage point below its April forecast for 2020. Also, the IMF notes that the 2020 \u201crecovery is not broad-based and remains precarious.\u201d\n\nIn particular, the IMF expects the U.S. economy to slow even further next year\n\nThe IMF places the blame for growth squarely on trade tensions, including the U.S.-China trade fight and Brexit. It now forecasts that world trade volumes will expand by just 1.1 percent this year, a huge downgrade from it\u2019s July estimate of 2.5 percent growth.", "description": "Trade volumes are expected to barely grow at all this year, bringing economic expansion to the lowest level since the financial crisis. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1141653815-e1571151031300-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
