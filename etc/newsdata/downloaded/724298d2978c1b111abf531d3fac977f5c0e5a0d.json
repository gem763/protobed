Graham calls Trump decision on Syria \u2018biggest blunder of his presidency\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Graham, one of Trump\u2019s strongest defenders, has broken with the president over his sudden decision to withdraw American military personnel, a move that triggered widespread condemnation from Republicans and Democrats. Turkish forces deepened their offensive against the Kurds on Thursday.\n\nGraham ratcheted up the criticism of Trump for his decision and lashed out at Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at a news conference at The Citadel military college in Charleston.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe president has abandoned the people who helped us destroy ISIS, chaos is unfolding, and when I hear the president \u2014 \u2018We\u2019re getting out of Syria\u2019 \u2014 my statement to you is this is worse than what Obama did,\u201d Graham said, comparing Trump to former president Barack Obama. \u201cWhen Obama left Iraq, all hell broke loose, and if you think, Mr. President, ISIS is only a threat to Europe, you really don\u2019t understand ISIS. ISIS is wanting to come after all of us. Not just Europeans.\u201d\n\nWhen a reporter asked if this could become Trump\u2019s Vietnam, Graham replied, \u201cNo, this is worse.\u201d\n\nGraham recounted a meeting two weeks ago with Erdogan in which he told the Turkish leader that a \u201cwin-win\u201d would be a situation in which an American-led international force would create a safe zone that would protect Turkey from the Kurds and vice versa.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe also said he told Erdogan, \u201cIf you go into Syria and try to deal with this through a military operation, I will crush your economy, you will be putting the American people in a bad spot, you will make us abandon somebody who helped us destroy ISIS \u2014 and you really did a lot to create ISIS by creating open flows of foreign fighters into Syria.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the three top House Republicans \u2014 Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), Whip Steve Scalise (La.) and conference Chair Liz Cheney (Wyo.) \u2014 announced that they and dozens of their GOP colleagues would be introducing legislation to impose sanctions on Turkey for its military offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces.\n\nThe legislation is similar to what Graham and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) have proposed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf Turkey wants to be treated like an ally, it must begin behaving like one. They must be sanctioned for their attacks on our Kurdish allies,\u201d Cheney said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nAt his news conference, Graham highlighted that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked people to \u201cpray for the Kurds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s sending a message to Americans,\u201d said Graham. \u201cYou need to stand by the Kurds, because if you abandon them, then the forces that oppose us are going to take over Syria.\u201d\n\nGraham spoke forcefully after a report said that he said this summer that he sympathized with Turkey\u2019s situation with the Kurds and had called them \u201ca threat.\u201d\n\nGraham made the comments when he answered his phone in August to discuss foreign policy with who he thought was Turkey\u2019s defense minister. He chatted for 16 minutes about Russia and Syria and Trump\u2019s thinking on those matters, but on the other end of the line wasn\u2019t a Turkish official, but known Russian pranksters.\n\nAD\n\nThe call was first reported Thursday by Politico.\n\nDays after that first call, the pranksters phoned Graham again, according to Politico. Graham filled them in on what he had spoken to Trump about vis-a-vis Graham\u2019s first call with the man he believed to be the defense minister.\n\n\u201cWe want a better relationship with Turkey. That\u2019s exactly what he wants,\u201d Graham said on the call.\n\nItkowitz reported from Washington.\n\nAD", "description": "The South Carolina Republican, one of Trump\u2019s strongest defenders, said the withdrawal of U.S. troops out of northern Syria was \u201cworse than what Obama did\u201d in Iraq.", "authors": ["Chris Dixon", "Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3uszZjajLyPWVP26nkmhxYf6y2Y=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OXEMAJHLYQI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
