Baseball America was the first to publish the report and said most people who provided information requested anonymity.\n\nAccording to the proposal, Minor League Baseball would shrink from 160 teams to 120. The Baseball America report calls the proposal preliminary and subject to alterations, an early idea at the start of what might be protracted negotiations.\n\nLeagues owned wholly by MLB would also see changes, the report said, with league sizes and classifications possibly affected.\n\nAccording to a statement from MLB and reported by the New York Times, \u201cWe are in discussions with the owners of the Minor League teams to reorganize elements of the system with the goal of improving the working conditions of minor league players, including upgrading the facilities to Major League standards, increasing player compensation, reducing travel time between affiliates for road games, improving transportation and hotel accommodations, increasing the number of off days, and providing better geographical affiliations between the MLB clubs and affiliates.\u201d\n\nThe people who did go on the record gave only general statements acknowledging that negotiations are taking place.\n\n\u201cWe are engaged with Major League Baseball on a successor agreement to the PBA. It\u2019s early in the negotiations, and that\u2019s the most I can say,\u201d said Pat O\u2019Conner, president of Minor League Baseball.\n\nMLB\u2019s deputy commissioner Dan Halem said, \u201cWe\u2019re at the very initial stages of the negotiations where each side is presenting to others the issues and concerns they have with the existing PBA.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Major League Baseball is floating a proposal that would eliminate up to 42 minor league baseball teams after the 2020 season.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
