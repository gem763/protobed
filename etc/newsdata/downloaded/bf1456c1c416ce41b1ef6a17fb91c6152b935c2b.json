The software is expected to process data on surroundings with lidar sensor input to better recognize and analyze moving and stationary objects nearby.Hyundai Mobis said the partnership aims to begin real-world use of the to-be-developed lidar systems in the Asian market including Korea first, then gradually expand the rollout to North America and Europe.Velodyne Lidar, which was established in 1983, has the largest share of the global lidar market.Hyundai Mobis developed a short-range radar last year. It is developing a deep-learning-based camera system and plans to enhance its radar technology by next year. The company said the partnership will help Hyundai Mobis move a step closer to reaching its goal of making a Level 3 automation system.BY KO JUN-TAE [ko.juntae@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
