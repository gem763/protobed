Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nIt was the spring of 2018, and there Terry McLaurin went again, running pass routes through the empty silence of Ohio State\u2019s indoor football building. Before him wobbled a tall, red tackling dummy with protruding fake arms. A few yards away whirred a pitching machine. A graduate assistant fed footballs into the machine\u2019s wheels until they spat out with a thwuck! that echoed off the walls.\n\nWhat had the school\u2019s coaches said was his weakness? Contested catches? Those plays they called 50-50 balls, where the receiver and defender both seemed to have the same chance to catch the pass, fighting for control? No way he was going to have any weaknesses, so he had invented a drill in these months before his senior season, pretending the tackling dummy was a defensive back that he had to find a way to twist and jump around to catch the ball as it shot from the machine.\n\nThe machine hummed, the balls burst from its spinning wheels and McLaurin kept running into that dummy, catching passes until dozens of those balls had burned into his hands and his arms ached. But he would be back again the next day and the day after that and the day after that, running more drills with the same dummies and the machine, until every weakness was a strength, because someday it would all matter.\n\nThen on Sunday, in his first Washington Redskins game, it did. More than a year after those days alone with the machine and the dummies, a pass was flying toward him and Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Ronald Darby. They jumped together, the ball landing, for an instant, in each of their hands \u2014 a classic 50-50 ball \u2014 then at the last second, McLaurin yanked it from Darby\u2019s grasp, falling to the ground with the ball pressed against his chest.\n\nAnd later, after a game in which McLaurin announced his arrival with a dazzling 69-yard touchdown catch, the play he cared about most was the catch that didn\u2019t make the postgame highlights.\n\n\u201cI worked extremely hard behind closed doors to improve that and to see it come to fruition \u2026\u201d he said, his voice trailing off.\n\n[Svrluga: Jay Gruden was already on shaky ground. Benching Adrian Peterson didn\u2019t help.]\n\nHe smiled. It was still early in the week after the whirlwind of a first game, which came after the whirlwind of a summer in which he went from a third-round pick the Redskins hoped could be a good special teams player and reserve wideout into one of their top offensive threats. A few days before they had released Josh Doctson, a wide receiver picked in 2016\u2019s first round, because they thought McLaurin could be good. And then he turned out to be better than they imagined.\n\nFor many young players, this would have been a lot, moments for which they weren\u2019t ready. But on the day after announcing himself to the NFL, McLaurin stood in the hall outside the Redskins\u2019 locker room and looked as if he had been waiting forever for this day to come.\n\n\u201cI feel like I have a maturity that is beyond my years. I hear that from a lot of people \u2014 my teammates, coaches, not just people here but people in the past,\u201d the 23-year-old said.\n\nBrian Hartline understands. The former Ohio State and later Dolphins and Browns wideout had returned to his college as an interim receivers coach in 2017 and was later promoted to the full-time job in 2018. He was the one who told McLaurin, during one of their many long talks, that he needed to get better at contested catches. He suggested drills, but it was McLaurin who did the work. Hour after hour, alone with that machine and the dummies.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take Hartline long to understand McLaurin was different from other college athletes. How many players graduate in 3\u00bd years and decide to stick around for another 1\u00bd because they think it will make them better? How many players at a place such as Ohio State are named team captains not just one year but two?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very diligent and has a clear focus,\u201d Hartline said.\n\n\n\nMcLaurin was a two-year captain for Ohio State. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nHartline spent years in the NFL watching players jog through individual workouts in practice. He hated that. Anyone can catch 100 passes from a pitching machine, he believes. But he likes to re-create situations, making obstacles that replicate the unpredictable things that happen in the games.\n\n\u201cDo you play with your mind?\u201d Hartline asks his players. Often, he asks himself, \u201cHow do you create a situation where something occurs in a game and you already did it in the arena?\u201d\n\nIn McLaurin, he found he had a player hungry to know, too. He had another drill at Ohio State where he\u2019d stand behind a line of those tackling dummies, unable to see the machine shooting out passes, until at the last minute he\u2019d slap one of the wobbling dummies aside and reach out to grab the ball just as the dummy crashed back into his arm. He did it again and again until he no longer cared if he could barely see the quarterback and defenders knocking into him as he tried to catch the ball.\n\n\u201cPeople think you drop the ball because of your hands,\u201d McLaurin said. \u201cMostly it\u2019s your eyes. You got to train your eyes. Rarely do you catch the ball cleanly.\u201d\n\nWhen the pro scouts came this past winter, they brought a list of the things they were sure McLaurin couldn\u2019t do. He was fast, they said, but his routes weren\u2019t perfect. They didn\u2019t think he could block. He wasn\u2019t great at those contested catches. Hartline listened, and then he laughed.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what he can\u2019t do well,\u201d he kept telling the scouts. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you he can\u2019t catch. I can\u2019t tell you he can\u2019t run. I can\u2019t tell you he can\u2019t block. I can\u2019t tell you he isn\u2019t smart. I can\u2019t tell you he doesn\u2019t work hard.\u201d\n\nWhat about this did they not understand?\n\n\n\nMcLaurin poses after his first career touchdown catch Sunday. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nSo far, the scouts with doubts look wrong. Two days before the Redskins\u2019 first game, offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell was talking about McLaurin and the way he runs his routes.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing is just the details,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\n\nThe routes that Washington\u2019s receivers run often start the same but split into different directions. There\u2019s a lot to know, and everything has to be precise.\n\n\u201cThe detail he takes [from] the meeting room to the practice field and the game field allows us to ask him to run various parts of the route tree,\u201d O\u2019Connell adds.\n\nStanding in the hallway outside the Redskins locker room this week, McLaurin said that worrying about the details was easy. Everything he knows about work and diligence and desire came from his parents, Terry Sr. and Grace. His father sells cars back home in Indianapolis, which is a grind in itself. If you don\u2019t sell any cars, you don\u2019t make any money \u2014 and the only way to sell cars is to always be in the dealership, ready when the next customer walks through the door.\n\nMcLaurin grew up watching this hustle, his father leaving early and coming home late. He noticed that as his father became more successful there was money for private schools for him and his sister, and then college tuition for his sister after he got a scholarship to Ohio State.\n\n\u201cThey taught me faith and hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have those two things, you can do anything.\u201d\n\nThen on Sunday he was in the place he always imagined, on an NFL field for the first time, and everything seemed normal. The stadium felt smaller than the one at Ohio State. He ran past the Eagles defenders the way he blew by defensive backs in college games. He had five catches for 125 yards and the long touchdown, and while that seemed like a lot to everyone else, it was what he expected to do.\n\nHe had put in the work, hadn\u2019t he? He doesn\u2019t want to sound cocky, he said, because his parents told him to always be humble. And while humble is hard when you\u2019re an NFL receiver, he does not like bragging.\n\nBut he is sure there is a reward for all his time spent trying to create an unexpected moment that others might not have imagined, so that when that situation comes, he will be the one who is least surprised.\n\n\u201cI try to go about my life on a consistent basis so everything else can fall in line, so I\u2019m not scrambling,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way I study my plays, the way I do my routine outside of football, the way I try to have balance in my life \u2014 my family, my friends \u2014 it really allows me to mitigate the crazy things that happen.\n\n\u201cObviously, not everything is going to go as you planned,\u201d he added.\n\nWhich is why you spend hours and hours trying to invent those instances when it won\u2019t.\n\nMore on the Redskins:\n\nThe Redskins say they have a great defensive line.
