He hates him. He\u2019s going to be negative.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: New leaked video from inside CNN: President Jeff Zucker tells employees to push \"impeachment\" and that all of CNN's stories should be about \"moves towards impeachment\" One of CNN's employees says Zucker has a \"personal vendetta against Trump\"pic.twitter.com/nu8fkfsXDk \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 14, 2019\n\nThe whistleblower identified himself as Cary Poarch, a satellite uplink technician at CNN\u2019s Washington, D.C. bureau.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to work at CNN, I mean it was my dream job,\u201d Poarch said. \u201cAnd that dream, actually turned into a nightmare.\u201d\n\nPoarch recorded the 9:00 a.m. morning calls held by Zucker, in which he urged CNN employees to focus on the impeachment narrative.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just stay very focused on impeachment,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving towards impeachment. I mean, don\u2019t like, you know we shouldn\u2019t pretend this is going one way. And so, all these moves are moves towards impeachment.\u201d\n\nZucker also encouraged CNN employees to report on Fox News as if it were a conspiracy outlet.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s going on in America now is really fundamentally the result of years of fake news, conspiracy nonsense from Fox News,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cThe fake conspiracy nonsense that Fox has spread for years is now deeply embedded in American society, and frankly that is beyond destructive for America. And I do not think we should be scared to say so.\u201d\n\nAfter the release of this video, Poarch announced he saw no other option but to wear a hidden camera and expose the bias of CNN.", "description": "A whistleblower leaked a video in which CNN President Jeff Zucker encourages employees to push the impeachment narrative.", "authors": ["Chrissy Clark"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cary-Poarch.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
