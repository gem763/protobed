I say this with absolute clarity: the core of the issue is capitalism.\u201d\n\nMorales also addressed ongoing concerns over the Amazon rainforest, with both he and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro facing intense scrutiny for their responses to a spate of recent wildfires.\n\n\u201cOur house, mother Earth, is our only home, and it is irreplaceable,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent weeks we have seen focal points for heat [in the Amazon rainforest] \u2026 We are fighting these fires using our financial resources. To date, our country has spent over 15 million dollars in order to put out the fires.\u201d\n\nThe 59-year-old strongman, who rose to power with the support of many of Bolivia\u2019s indigenous peoples, has in recent years taken various steps to consolidate his power and turn the country into a socialist state.\n\nSome of his measures include the scrapping of term limits, reforms to the judicial system, the imprisonment of political opponents, and the realignment of the country\u2019s foreign policy towards closer relationships with Latin American leftist regimes such as Cuba and Venezuela, as well as authoritarian regimes further afield such as Iran, China, and Syria.\n\n\u201cThe administration of President Evo Morales has created a hostile environment for human rights defenders that undermines their ability to work independently,\u201d notes the human rights campaign group Human Rights Watch. \u201cA judicial reform that began in 2016 risks seriously weakening the rule of law in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtensive and arbitrary use of pretrial detention\u2014and long trial delays\u2014undermine defendants\u2019 rights and contribute to prison overcrowding,\u201d adds the organization. \u201cImpunity for past human rights abuses, violence against women, and child labor are other major concerns.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Bolivia's far-left leader Evo Morales lectured the United Nations General Assembly on the evils of capitalism on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Evo-Morales-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
