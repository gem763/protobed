While Warren's push for increased regulation could pose a threat to some industries, a democratic presidency could also present some positive themes for US equity investors, RBC added.\n\n\"The election of a progressive Democrat seems supportive of the already growing popularity of ESG as an investment approach, since issues like climate change and fair pay could be in the spotlight,\" the firm said in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nDividends could also become more popular as share buybacks typically lose political favor under democrats, RBC added.\n\nRead more: A Wall Street investment chief says stock market levels are 'completely unjustified' \u2014 and shares how he's positioning his portfolio in an economy that looks 'primed for recession'", "description": "Some investors and analysts are growing increasingly concerned about the prospect of democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren taking the White H...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d9b4c60ee40e4317c33d0bc-2000/elizabeth-warren.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
