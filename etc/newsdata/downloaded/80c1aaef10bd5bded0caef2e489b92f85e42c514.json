REUTERS/Mary Schwalm/File Photo\n\nThe former vice president is the only Democrat currently fighting a two-front war: one against the other contenders seeking his party\u2019s nomination and a second, more brutal one against Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nSome of his top backers worry Biden will lack the resources he needs for a sustained conflict. Biden has struggled with online fundraising and, unlike past Democrats, refuses donations from lobbyists and is not supported by a well-funded political action committee, known as a Super PAC.\n\nWhen it comes to combating Trump, Biden is bringing \u201ca knife to a gunfight,\u201d said John Morgan, a Florida trial lawyer and a leading fundraiser for Biden.\n\nBiden \u201cdoesn\u2019t need a gun. He needs a bazooka,\u201d Morgan added.\n\nWhile the November 2020 general election remains a year away and the Democratic nominee still remains to be chosen, Trump and his allies have made Biden their top target, repeatedly alleging - without offering evidence - that Biden improperly tried to aid his son Hunter\u2019s business interests in Ukraine and China.\n\nTrump now faces an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives centreing on the president pressuring a vulnerable ally, Ukraine, to investigate the Bidens for his own political benefit.\n\nEven so, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has committed millions for television ads that push the same allegations against Biden, with a focus on early voting states in the party nomination battle including Iowa and New Hampshire. It has been joined in that effort by Great America PAC, a pro-Trump committee.\n\nBiden, for his part, has tried to counter with his own early-state ad blitz that calls the president \u201cunhinged.\u201d\n\nBut with fundraising of $15 million in the year\u2019s third quarter, he is facing a juggernaut in the Trump campaign, which had raised $125 million along with the Republican National Committee in the same period. Biden\u2019s fundraising also trails his leading Democratic rivals, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom amassed around $25 million.\n\n\u201cThis is a going to be an all-pitched war fought with huge dollars,\u201d said Joseph Falk, a top Biden fundraiser in Miami.\n\nAs distasteful as the idea has become in Democratic circles, a Super PAC may be necessary to battle Trump, some Biden donors told Reuters.\n\nA Super PAC \u201cwould not be my preferred method,\u201d Falk said, but \u201cyou can\u2019t fight a battle with one hand behind your back.\u201d\n\nBiden will be onstage on Tuesday in Ohio with 11 other Democrats seeking the party\u2019s nomination. The subject of Hunter Biden\u2019s work likely will be brought up.\n\nHunter Biden on Sunday released a statement saying he was leaving the board of a Chinese private equity company and pledged to forego all foreign work if his father is elected president.\n\nBiden has struggled to match the grassroots appeal of Warren and Sanders, who rake in most of their funds online through small donations. Both candidates, running to the left of Biden, have made getting big money out of politics a major theme.\n\nBiden has had to rely on traditional Democratic fundraisers, where donors write checks and mingle with the candidate.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has said there are signs that Trump\u2019s attacks have increased donations, noting that it raised $1 million online during the first week of October alone.\n\nIt also lacks weapons employed by 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who accepted contributions from lobbyists and whose campaign was aided by several Super PACs.\n\nAt this point four years ago, Priorities USA, the top Clinton PAC, had raised more than $40 million to bolster her campaign\u2019s efforts.\n\nThis time around, Priorities is not backing a single Democratic candidate, choosing instead to run ads attacking Trump in battleground states.\n\n\u201cOur singular focus is on defeating Trump, and it\u2019s up to Democratic voters\u201d to pick their nominee, said Josh Schwerin, the group\u2019s spokesman.\n\n\u2018LIES AND SLANDER\u2019\n\nThe Biden campaign believes Super PACs, which can receive unlimited donations, are a corrupting influence in politics.\n\n\u201cThe attacks aimed at this campaign from dark-money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,\u201d said TJ Ducklo, a Biden spokesman.\n\nDark money refers to funds from outside political groups, with the identity of the donors undisclosed.\n\nRufus Gifford, who oversaw Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential re-election fundraising efforts, said the Democratic Party needs \u201cto do everything we can with the stakes as high as they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t a threat to our democracy, we can have this talk about the moral high ground,\u201d Gifford said.\n\nOther Biden backers criticise the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and its chairman, Tom Perez, for not doing enough to push back against what they see as Trump\u2019s dishonest attacks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no pushback on Trump, no message,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a Biden fundraiser in South Carolina and former state party chair.\n\nHarold Schaitberger, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, a union that has endorsed Biden, expressed frustration over \u201ca lot of silence\u201d from the DNC and other party leaders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crickets,\u201d Schaitberger said.\n\nAfter being criticized in 2016 for appearing to favour Clinton, the DNC has sworn to remain neutral this time.\n\nBiden\u2019s donors still remain optimistic about his prospects and came away encouraged from an early October meeting of about 100 donors in Philadelphia. Biden fundraiser Falk said attendance was better than expected and enthusiasm was high.\n\nA frontrunner for much of the 2020 Democratic race, Biden has not lost significant support in national polls since Trump\u2019s request to Ukraine came to light.\n\nUltimately, though, a successful 2020 Democratic nominee will have to be able raise money online and from traditional high-dollar fundraisers to defeat Trump, Falk said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go into a race,\u201d Falk said, \u201cbeing outspent two or three-to-one and win.\u201d", "description": "As Joe Biden squares off against a bevy of Democratic challengers at a U.S. presidential debate on Tuesday, his fiercest opponent will not be sharing the stage with him.", "authors": ["James Oliphant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440679725&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0SK", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
