And so we\u2019re going to speak as defiantly and as strongly as we can, but we\u2019re also going to take action.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 hopeful\u2019s uncensored demands for gun reform echo his remarks at a Virginia campaign event over the weekend. After hearing news of the shooting on Saturday, he told attendees that while they didn\u2019t yet know the motivation of the shooter or how he obtained his firearms, \u201cwe do know this is fucked up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do know that this has to stop in this country,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no reason that we have to accept this as our fortune, as our future, as our fate, yet functionally right now we have.\u201d\n\nSince the El Paso shooting, which led to a brief suspension of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign as he publicly and privately grieved with his city\u2019s residents, the former Democratic Senate candidate has sharpened the focus of his presidential campaign to more directly address gun control and the nation\u2019s history of violence.\n\n\u201cWe need to tell the truth, connect the dots, and take immediate action to end the culture of hate and violence in our country\u2014because when one of our communities is targeted, all of us, the very idea of America, is under attack,\u201d he told The Daily Beast recently after returning to the campaign trail.\n\nWhile the mass shooting between the Texas cities of Odessa and Midland led to renewed calls to action from all the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, the race\u2019s two candidates from Texas\u2014O\u2019Rourke and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2014spoke the most effusively about the violence in multiple Sunday show appearances.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lies that the president has told include that he would do something about universal background checks,\u201d Castro said on Meet the Press, referencing how Trump had briefly toyed with the idea of action only to inevitably be swayed by the National Rifle Association. \u201cHe said that twice after Parkland and then after El Paso and Dayton. And he\u2019s gone back on his word.\u201d\n\nIn President Trump's initial tweet about the shooting on Sunday morning, he did not address the issue of gun control.\n\nThough according to the pool report, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the same things.... It really hasn't changed anything.\u201d And that \u201cCongress has a lot of thinking to do.\u201d He also reportedly expressed that background checks \u201cwould not have stopped any of it.\u201d\n\nEven as Castro and O\u2019Rourke spoke about the necessity of new gun legislation, a number of new loosened firearm laws went into effect in Texas on Sunday, despite the Lone Star state being home to some of the deadliest mass shootings in American history.\n\nThe measures were reportedly passed in during the 2019 legislative session and include permitting licensed gun owners to store a firearm in a locked vehicle, loosening some restrictions on the number of armed school marshals at public or private schools and allowing licensed gun owners to carry weapons in places of worships.\n\nAt least one Republican senator continued to assert on Sunday that President Trump wants to do \u201csomething meaningful,\u201d on the issue of gun control. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) said on ABC\u2019s This Week, that he had spoken with the president about a bill he co-sponsored to expand background checks on gun sales. But even he said he wasn\u2019t sure that tangible progress will be made.\n\n\u201cI can't guarantee an outcome, I don't know where this all ends, but the president is very interested, I am very interested in measures that make it harder for people who shouldn't have guns to get guns, and we're going to take a very serious run at \u201d Toomey said.", "description": "\u201cThe biggest lies that the president has told include that he would do something about universal background checks,\u201d Julian Castro said on Meet the Press on Sunday.", "authors": ["Gideon Resnick", "Justin Baragona", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567351246/state-union-jake-tapper_14_f6lv2y"}
