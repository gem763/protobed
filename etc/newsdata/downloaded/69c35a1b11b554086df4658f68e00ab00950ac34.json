Trump, naturally, went berserk on Twitter:\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSuch outbursts are bad for the president, but in many ways even worse for Republican members of Congress \u2013 they have constituencies to answer to and reputations to uphold. When the president does things like rant and rave at the United Nations or make the Ukrainian president look visibly uncomfortable during a joint press conference, it reflects on them all.\n\nAnd while a conviction in the Senate is dead upon arrival, Republican lawmakers should still be able read the writing in front of them: it\u2019s time to abandon ship. I don\u2019t say this for moral or ethical reasons; this isn\u2019t a call to patriotism. At some point the president and key members of his administration are going down, probably with criminal charges, and anyone who doesn\u2019t at least get out of the way may end up going down with them.\n\nUtah senator and former Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, got the memo. He is saying he\u2019s \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the whistleblower allegations and how it was handled by the White House. And that was before Trump joked with US mission staff at the UN last week alluding to torturing whistleblowers in the old days. Hilarious, indeed.\n\nUnfortunately, with former Arizona Senator John McCain now gone, it is unlikely any other Republicans will be joining Romney\u2019s ranks. It seemed like Nevada Rep. Mark Amodei was going to support impeachment for a brief moment over the weekend \u2014 but he has since clarified that he merely supports \u201coversight\u201d.\n\nThose who remain steadfast at the side of the president do so at their own risk. Bragging about torturing people or committing crimes is generally not good for business. It wasn\u2019t good for Nixon, who had the foresight to resign before he was forced to explain his crimes to Congress and American taxpayers. And while Republicans have been wagging their fingers at Democrats warning that impeachment in an election year (a first in US history) could be a fateful move for Dems up for re-election, history tells us a different story.\n\nNixon\u2019s resignation helped Democrats in the following elections and the Republican impeachment of Clinton helped move George W Bush into the White House. The same happened when Republicans impeached, but weren\u2019t able to convict, President Andrew Johnson in 1868. In spite of the lack of conviction, Republicans still maintained their majority in Congress and even won the presidency in the next election with Ulysses S Grant.\n\nFurthermore, during the 1974 Watergate scandal, the few Republicans that chose Rule of Law and their reputation over party alliances, like Nixon\u2019s Attorney General Elliot Richardson, or Rep. Lawrence Hogan, Rep. M Caldwell Butler and Sen. Howard Baker are remembered as Republicans with moral courage at a critical moment in history. They continue to be honored as representatives of a party with values, something older generations of Republicans lament that the Grand Ol\u2019 Party used to stand for.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway\u2019s husband, attorney George Conway, tweeted a couple of days ago that Trump will be regarded in the future as \u201cwithout a doubt, the dumbest and worst\u201d president in history. If that\u2019s his legacy, his supporters should consider what theirs will be by association.\n\nThe situation at hand reminds me of one of the more morbid cases from my first year of law school: The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens. In the 1884 case, the two defendants, another man and an English boy had been lost at sea on a British vessel with no food or water and no signs of relief to come. After 20 days, the defendants decided to save themselves by killing and eating the boy, who was weak from starvation and dehydration. Dudley, Stephens and another shipmate (who protested against the killing) were rescued several days after the murder and quickly brought to trial. They argued the defense of necessity \u2013 that it was necessary to kill and eat one in order to save three. The court disagreed and the defendants were convicted of murder.\n\nRepublicans find themselves in a similarly difficult predicament. But in this case, they are not cast away at sea \u2014 rather, the captain of the ship has lost his wits and won\u2019t release the helm. The paradise is lost. It\u2019s time to abandon ship, ladies and gentlemen \u2013 if not for good of country, then for self-preservation. I say: eat the guy and save yourselves, before you end up described in the history books as spineless hypocrites.", "description": "As more details continued to emerge about the Ukraine scandal, over the weekend House Democrats announced their plans to move quickly through the impeachment investigation.
