The saddest part is that the victims are actually the ones triggering the avalanches in the first place.\n\nAvalanches are one of the most powerful forces of nature humans ever come across. In seconds, they can sweep trains off their tracks, uproot trees, and collapse entire buildings. They can also bury unsuspecting backcountry travelers under feet of snow. But there are some tricks you can learn to make sure that slope won't be your last.\n\nThe number one way to avoid getting caught in an avalanche? It's pretty obvious steer clear of places where avalanches happen, namely snow-capped mountains with steep slopes. Specifically, slopes between 30-45 degrees.\n\nBut if you insist on climbing Everest or skiing in Aspen, then your first rule of thumb should always be to check the daily avalanche forecast. Most avalanches happen right after a heavy snowstorm especially a windy one. Winds can pack the snow in more tightly, creating a strong, dense layer of snow on top.\n\nBut you can't predict an avalanche by this layer, alone. The real threat is what lies underneath. If the underlying layer of snow is weaker than the top, all it takes is the right amount of pressure and WHUMPF!\n\nThat's the first thing you'll hear. It's the weak layer collapsing under your added weight, like a house of cards. You may even see cracks form in the slab of snow around you. If you can, try to get off the slab, since that's what will be tumbling downhill in a few milliseconds.\n\nBut if you're unable to escape, try grabbing on to a nearby tree. No trees?\n\nThen you're going to go for a ride. But don't lose hope! Immediately cover your mouth to prevent snow from getting into it and hope you don't crash into anything.\n\nBeing in avalanche is like being caught in a violent ocean wave. Over 70% of deaths occur because the person can't breathe. That's why it's imperative that you try to keep your head above the swelling cloud of snow around you. This moment, right here, could make the difference between life and death.\n\nDon't worry too much about form. Thrashing, kicking, breaststroke whatever keeps you near the surface. And contrary to popular belief, if you're wearing a backpack, hold on to it!\n\nThe second-highest risk of death is trauma from hitting a tree, boulder, or another stationary object at a high speed. Keep your backpack on, and you have an extra cushion behind you for protection.\n\nAfter the snow settles, there's not much you can do but wait for rescue.\n\nThis isn't like the snow you're used to once it stops, the consistency will feel like cement. It's nearly impossible to dig out of.\n\nYour biggest concern now is breathing which will not be easy, and could even backfire on you. While snow is often porous, your warm breath can temporarily melt the snow that's in front of your face. And under the cold conditions, that water will likely re-freeze into ice, which is not good.\n\nWhat you're left with is a layer of ice that basically seals you in with the CO2 you're exhaling. You might as well tape a plastic bag over your head.\n\nTo avoid suffocating, try to punch your hand to the surface. This offers a clear signal to rescuers and if you can wiggle it around creates an air shaft for you to breathe.\n\nStatistics show that you have the best chance of survival if you're rescued within about 15 minutes. After 20 minutes, your chances drop to about 30%.\n\nThanks to advanced technology, there are ways you can drastically improve your odds. Attach an avalanche beacon to yourself before you even go into the backcountry. Rescuers can use it to track you down.Also consider wearing an airbag pack, which can keep you buoyant in an avalanche.\n\nEven with these tools, safety isn't guaranteed. So, be smart about when and where you choose to climb.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This video was originally published on April 27, 2018.", "description": "Avalanches can be so strong, uprooting anything that blocks their path.
