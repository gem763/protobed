Each faces two counts of neglect of a dependent for allegedly abandoning their minor adopted daughter in Lafayette in 2013 before moving the rest of the family to Canada.\n\nKristine Barnett shook her head no as Tippecanoe County Magistrate Dan Moore read the charges against her. When asked whether she understood the charges, she said she did.\n\nThe couple's trial date is scheduled for Jan. 28, 2020.\n\nAs per the condition of their bond, the Barnetts may not leave Indiana without permission from authorities, and they may not consume alcohol or use drugs.\n\nReturns to Lafayette: Man accused of changing adopted daughter's age, abandoning her, turns himself in\n\nMother, grandmother charged with neglect after unsupervised child struck sibling with knife\n\nBefore she arrived at the courthouse, Kristine Barnett called police to request an escort. Officers met her at a restaurant and followed her to the county parking garage.\n\nFrom there, sheriff's deputies escorted Barnett to the courthouse for her hearing.\n\nKristine Barnett leaves court after an initial hearing Sept. 27 in which a plea of not guilty was entered in response to charges that she abandoned her adopted daughter in 2013. More\n\nMichael Barnett's attorney, Terrance Kinnard, asked that the prosecutor clarify the state's allegation of neglect.\n\nJackie Starbuck, deputy prosecutor in Tippecanoe County, responded that the charge can refer to neglecting a person who is a minor or neglecting a person who has mental illnesses.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Kinnard declared his client \u2013 and by association, Kristine Barnett \u2013 not guilty.\n\nTwins died: Tennessee mom charged with murder after premature twins died, tested positive for drugs\n\nChildren escape: 'We're free': Florida twins tell harrowing account of escape from adoptive parents\n\n\"We're going to be filing motions within the court to get more specificity as to what they believe the nature of the dependency was of this individual. As we've alleged before, this person was not a minor child at no time during the time she was in the care or custody of my client. This was, in fact, some sort of ruse ... perpetrated on my client,\" Kinnard said.\n\nThe girl would have been 10 in September 2013, according to birth records from her native Ukraine.\n\nProsecutors said two bone scans on her \u2013 one in 2010 and another in 2012 \u2013 indicated her birth records were accurate, according to a probable cause affidavit.\n\nIn June 2012, the Barnetts legally changed their daughter's birth record to indicate she was born in 1989, not 2003, as her Ukrainian records indicated.\n\nMichael and Kristine Barnett rented one of the apartments in this Lafayette, Ind., house for their adopted daughter. Then the rest of the family moved to Canada, so their prodigy son could study at the Perimeter Institute.
