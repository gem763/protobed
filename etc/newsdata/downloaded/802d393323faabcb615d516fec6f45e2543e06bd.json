About 60 people were gathered at Le Bernadin, including such hotshots as Alan Dershowitz, former attorney general Michael Mukasey and Newsmax chief Chris Ruddy.\n\nSo the leak, in this case to Politico, was inevitable. The former Fox News contributor certainly gets that any words uttered before such a large audience will soon find their way into print.\n\nSIZE MATTERS? MEDIA PRAISE ELIZABETH WARREN -- AND HER CROWDS\n\nWhat\u2019s fascinating here is that the Bolton broadside comes as Trump\u2019s handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increasing media criticism, especially from the right. The president is essentially in a no-win situation, whether he chooses a military strike against Iran or sticks with diplomacy and sanctions. The neocon wing of the GOP wants him to retaliate for the attack on Saudi oil facilities that our intel agencies are blaming on Iran, and is casting his reluctance as a sign of weakness.\n\nBolton told the luncheon that any negotiations were Iran (and North Korea) are \u201cdoomed to failure,\u201d according to Politico.\n\n\u201cBolton also said more than once that Trump\u2019s failure to respond to the Iranian attack on an American drone earlier this summer set the stage for the Islamic Republic\u2019s aggression in recent months\u2026Bolton said the planned response had gone through the full process and everybody in the White House had agreed on the retaliatory strike. But \u2018a high authority, at the very last minute,\u2019 without telling anyone, decided not to do it.\u201d\n\nReporters quickly asked Trump for his response. \u201cJohn was not able to work with anybody, and a lot of people disagreed with his ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people were very critical that I brought him on in the first place because of the fact that he was so in favor of going into the Middle East, and he got stuck in quicksand and we became policemen for the Middle East. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nThe president was referring to the Iraq war and Bolton\u2019s role in the Bush administration. Trump ran against that war, and endless wars, and obviously wants to get out of Afghanistan.\n\nThe neocons are growing more critical of Trump\u2019s reluctance to pull the trigger in these situations. He even got into a little spat with his pal Lindsey Graham, who said, like Bolton, that the president\u2019s failure to strike back after Iran downed an American drone is what paved the way for the attack that cut Saudi oil production in half.\n\nThe Beltway press, as part of an establishment whose kids are rarely sent off to fight, often reflects these pro-war instincts. Iraq, you\u2019ll recall, was going to be a cakewalk.\n\nBret Stephens, a conservative New York Times columnist who detests the president, wrote yesterday that Trump\u2019s policy is \u201clocked, half-cocked, and probably bluffing.\u201d He said this president combines \u201cthe rhetorical impulses of Bob Dornan with the strategic instincts of Dennis Kucinich.\u201d\n\nTrump does like to talk tough with foreign adversaries. And obviously he has ordered airstrikes before. But it\u2019s no accident that he threatened to incinerate North Korea and wound up in a pen pal relationship with Kim Jong-un.\n\nAnd yet if he keeps turning to sanctions and diplomacy, does there come a point where he looks like Barack Obama and his Syrian red line?\n\nTrump is bound to disappoint the neocons by exercising restraint when it comes to military options, knowing full well that there are unintended consequences that could bog down U.S. troops for years to come. That means he\u2019s likely to face continued criticism from John Bolton, but might be in tune with the war-weary portion of the country.", "description": "John Bolton had to know he was sending a message to the man who pushed him out of the White House.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/19/694940094001_6087835928001_6087828507001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
