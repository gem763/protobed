Overall much better than the LA presser.\u2019\n\nThe whole ordeal started after KSI won in a boxing match against British YouTuber Joe Weller. KSI took his victory to call out Logan which began this entire crazy buzz.\n\nThe rematch is due to take place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Saturday 9 November.\n\nThe first match ended in a majority draw following six rounds of sparring \u2013 in an evening which also saw Logan\u2019s brother Jake Paul go head to head with KSI\u2019s brother Deji.\n\nThe YouTube stars will face off next month (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nAt the time Logan called for a rematch, saying: \u2018I think it\u2019s what the people want. Let\u2019s give them a motherf*****g rematch!\u2019 KSI was in agreement as he declared:\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s do that again, that was fun. Holy shit.\u2019\n\nKSI doesn\u2019t want Logan to be the only Paul that he takes on in the ring, as he also his sights set on Logan\u2019s brother Jake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking exclusively to TMZ, KSI said: \u2018I want to fight Jake Paul, man. I really want to break his face.\u2019\n\nKSI \u2013 real name Olajide William \u2018JJ\u2019 Olatunji \u2013 and Logan\u2019s first match ended in a draw, but if there was a winner Jake would have been next in line to take the novice boxer on.\n\n\u2018I would love to break Jake\u2019s face as well as Logan\u2019s. I personally don\u2019t think, as soon as I knock out Logan, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna want to fight me,\u2019 he said.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
