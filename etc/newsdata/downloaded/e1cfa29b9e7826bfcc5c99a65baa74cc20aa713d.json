PG, +1.37% stock jumped 4.3% in Tuesday premarket trading after the consumer products company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and sales that beat expectations. Net income totaled $3.59 billion, or $1.36 per share, up from $3.20 billion, or $1.22 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS was $1.37, well ahead of the $1.24 per share FactSet consensus. Sales of $17.80 billion were up from $16.69 billion for the previous period and ahead of the $17.45 billion FactSet guidance. P&G said it had \"disproportionate growth\" in the skin and personal care group, with premium brands like SK-II. For fiscal 2020, P&G revised its forecast to sales growth of 3% to 5% from growth of 3% to 4%. EPS is expected to grow 225% to 243% with the comparison period \"significantly depressed\" by the Gillette Shave Care impairment adjustments in fiscal 2019. P&G now expects adjusted EPS growth for fiscal 2020 in the range of 5% to 10% versus previous guidance for 4% to 9% growth. The company expects to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2020 and pay more than $7.5 billion in dividends.
