You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s latest Brexit deal may yet be voted on again in the coming weeks, but already there are signs that opposition MPs will seek to amend it or use other procedures to continue to influence the way in which the UK leaves the European Union, or whether it will do so at all.\n\nThat is absolutely their right. There is no sensible analysis that shows Brexit will do anything other than make the country poorer, damaging lives and livelihoods. MPs are not honour bound to believe in Brexit. Nothing at all compels them to make their constituents poorer.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Best pictures from Final Say Brexit march Show all 76 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

the two main parties as brutally as it does the country. But the result has broken the process. Many Labour MPs in constituencies that voted to leave feel they are morally, or perhaps politically, bound to respect the result \u2013 to vote, in other words, for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, even though it bears no relation to the type of Brexit he promised, and is in every way anathema to all of the Labour Party\u2019s values.\n\nPoliticians and political parties will gain nothing in the end from genuflecting in front of beliefs they do not hold now, have not held in the past and will never hold in the future.\n\nYes, many Labour constituencies did vote to leave. But the evidence is clear that they did so with the assistance of millions of voters who have never voted Labour and will never do so.\n\nPolitical parties surrendering their values in the service of other people\u2019s voters is not normal. It is a bizarre mutation caused by a representative democracy trying to implement the choice made by direct democracy. It will not work. And it will not heal division, either.\n\nNow, at the end of 2019, the choice on offer from Brexit is clear. No deal is not credible. Boris Johnson\u2019s deal is, it would appear, the only form of Brexit the EU will now offer.\n\nOf course, a second referendum will be fought with passion, and tempers may flare. It will, nevertheless, provide a clear answer.\n\nThis is the Brexit on offer. It\u2019s negotiated, it\u2019s clear. Those who voted for Brexit, just as those who did not, have a right to say whether this is really what they voted for. And, more to the point, those who didn\u2019t vote for Brexit, but don\u2019t want a second referendum, also have a clear and noble option open to them, which is to vote Leave.\n\nThere will be more closure to be found this way than in the alternative: a Brexit deal, nothing like that which was promised, which is likely to be a touchstone of bitter loathing in the years ahead as its economic consequences become clear.\n\nMPs should be wary of taking this path when alternatives are available. The alternative is the path many MPs \u2013 especially Labour MPs \u2013 are choosing, which is to suspend their better judgement to knowingly cause harm to their constituents, a tremendously foolish path indeed.\n\nThe only argument Brexiteers appear to have left is the one Michael Gove makes with regularity: that the economic harm of Brexit will be less damaging than the harm to our democracy of not leaving the European Union at all.\n\nIt is a remarkable argument \u2013 that Brexit must be delivered to fulfil the broken promises of the Brexiteers themselves.\n\nA second referendum leaves no such deficit. MPs, parties and ordinary voters will be free to do only as they think best.\n\nThere are no imperfect options. A Final Say is the best way forward, by far.", "description": "There was no signature on the letter Boris Johnson sent to Brussels on Saturday night, but there will be more than 150,000 on the one that will shortly land on his doormat\u00a0and in the offices of every MP in the country.
