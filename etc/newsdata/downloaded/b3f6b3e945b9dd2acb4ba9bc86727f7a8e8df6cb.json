They had the best record in the National League with a 106-56 mark and won their seventh straight National League West division title.\n\nBut the Dodgers know it is World Series or bust for them. They already had a taste and lost to the Houston Astros in 2017 and the Boston Red Sox in 2018. The core in Cody Bellinger, Corey Seager and Max Muncy is still there in the lineup along with Clayton Kershaw and Walker Buehler leading the charge in the rotation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nationals are looking to continue their Cinderella story.\n\nWashington, after having lost Bryce Harper and being 19-31 at one point during the season, were definitely not the favorites to contend for the postseason. However, a couple of lucky breaks in the Wild Card game against the Milwaukee Brewers landed Washington in the NLDS.\n\nThe Nationals won 93 games behind pitchers Stephen Strasburg and Max Scherzer. The team also received an MVP-type season from Anthony Rendon and 34 home runs from Juan Soto in his second season with the Nationals.\n\nWashington might be the underdogs in the series, but it appears they thrive in that role.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the National League Division Series matchup between the two clubs.\n\n--\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nGame 1: Nationals @ Dodgers (Oct. 3, 8:37 pm ET)\n\nGame 2: Nationals @ Dodgers (Oct. 4, 9:37 pm ET)\n\nGame 3*: Dodgers @ Nationals (Oct. 6, 7:45 pm ET)\n\nGame 4:* Dodgers @ Nationals (Oct. 7, TBD)\n\nGame 5*: Nationals @ Dodgers (Oct. 9, TBD)\n\nAll games will be on TBS\n\n--\n\nDODGERS NLDS ROSTER\n\n--\n\nNATIONALS NLDS ROSTER\n\n--\n\nPITCHING MATCHUPS\n\nGame 1: Walker Buehler (LAD) vs. Patrick Corbin\n\nGame 2: TBD vs. TBD\n\nGame 3: TBD vs. TBD\n\nGame 4: TBD vs. TBD\n\nGame 5: TBD vs. TBD", "description": "Previewing the 2019 National League Division Series matchup between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the St. Louis Cardinals.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
