Photos: Kenneth Chan\n\nAfter four placings at Sha Tin on Sunday, Aldo Domeyer is hungry for a winner at Happy Valley on Wednesday night before he jets off to South Africa on indefinite leave to join his girlfriend Sharna and meet his third child.\n\nSharna is due to give birth on Tuesday and Domeyer will head off to be with his family soon after.\n\n\u201cIt will be born on Tuesday so I\u2019m just going to miss it. I\u2019m going to take up my engagements on Wednesday because I\u2019ve got a fair book of rides,\u201d Domeyer said.\n\n\u201cHopefully after that I can leave on a good note and then I\u2019ll be in touch with the Jockey Club and try and get back as soon as I can.\u201d\n\nDomeyer and his girlfriend have two boys already, however the nerves are starting to kick in for the 32-year-old.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously butterflies. It\u2019s a pity I\u2019m not going to be there for the actual birth but we\u2019ve all got to make some sacrifices. I\u2019m really excited for what\u2019s to come,\u201d he said after riding Sunshine Warrior, Villa Fionn, Highly Proactive and Beauty Loyal into the placings at Sha Tin on Sunday.\n\nDomeyer is not yet sure how long he will be away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see how my girlfriend handles everything and how long she needs me. Hopefully she recovers nicely and I can get back without missing a beat,\u201d he said.\n\nDomeyer has four winners so far this season and he went within a neck of a fifth aboard Ricky Yiu Poon-fai\u2019s Villa Fionn, flashing home from the back of the field but having to settle for third behind Such A Happiness and Blastoise.\n\nFour-year-old fliers stand tall\n\nWhile Golden Sixty lived up to the hype as the $2.40 favourite in the Class Two IWC Excellent Handicap (1,400m), a pair of Caspar Fownes-trained gallopers also showed they could have a big say when the four-year-old series rolls around.\n\nGolden Sixty has now won five of his six starts and performed at 1,400m for the first time as Francis Lui Kin-wai plots a course to January\u2019s Classic Mile.\n\nThe gelding\u2019s win came in the middle of a Vincent Ho Chak-yiu running treble that was bookended by victories aboard Rise High and Preciousship and the jockey was pleased with the performance.\n\nGolden Sixty is a star! \u2b50\ufe0f Vincent Ho brings up a race-to-race double as Francis Lui's charge takes his record to five wins from six starts. #HKracing pic.twitter.com/M5ZfSve8c6 \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 20, 2019\n\n\u201cHe did very well, drawn one the goal was to relax him and just try to look for a run but the run just came about and I was very lucky, once I got clear I knew he was going to win,\u201d Ho said.\n\nFownes\u2019 duo The Hulk and Columbus County both impressed in their Hong Kong debuts, with the former sticking on nicely for third and the latter rattling home from the back to finish fourth.\n\n\u201cThey both ran well, they were bought for the four-year-old series and it was good to see,\u201d Fownes said.\n\nHall and Chan friends in the end\n\nJockey Alfred Chan Ka-hei may have tested his friendship with trainer David Hall at Sha Tin on Sunday, but he won the Australian over in the end on his way to a double.\n\nThe apprentice\u2019s first win aboard Big Fortune came at the expense of Hall\u2019s Quadruple Double but the trainer was in good spirits after Chan saluted aboard Mr Lumieres for him soon after.\n\n\u201cBefore we went out for race four, he made a joke and said \u2018I\u2019m not talking to you, you beat my horse\u2019,\u201d Chan said. \u201cAfter I won for him with Mr Lumieres he said \u2018we\u2019re friends again now\u2019.\u201d\n\nMr Lumieres was impressive in winning at $40 to notch his third victory at start 13, with hot favourite Classic Unicorn a disappointing sixth after two consecutive wins to start his career.\n\nTwo rides, two wins! 2\u20e3 @alfie_ck94 brings up an early double, this time scoring aboard Mr Lumieres at 39/1! #HKracing pic.twitter.com/zTDyY8arsV \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 20, 2019\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always had good form down the straight. He\u2019s probably going a little bit better this year than last year, he was having a few internal problems last season,\u201d Hall said.\n\n\u201cI saw him in the parade today and he looked as good as he\u2019s looked in a long time so I think he was back to his best.\u201d\n\nChan said he was \u201cjust feeling good\u201d on Sunday and says he\u2019ll take confidence from his efforts.\n\nHappiness for in-form galloper\n\nAfter frustrating punters no end for the majority of last season, Aerohappiness looks to have found his groove after notching his second consecutive win and third victory from his last five starts at Sha Tin yesterday.\n\nAfter a win and a second in Class Four in his debut season, the five-year-old began last season in Class Three and started $3.60 or shorter six times on the bounce, letting down punters each time.\n\nAfter three more fruitless runs at longer odds, Aerohappiness begun his run of form with a victory in May and has been in the top two in all but one run since.\n\nBack-to-back wins for Aerohappiness while Joao Moreira secures his first for the afternoon! #HKracing pic.twitter.com/n4PegJjkMU \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 20, 2019\n\n\u201cIt took him a little bit of time to hit his straps but now he has got a racing pattern that suits him and he is improved and taken very small steps in the last half-dozen starts to win a couple of races,\u201d trainer John Size said.\n\n\u201cHe gets a bit of blood so he gets up there and then doesn\u2019t [win] but now he\u2019s got some sort of rhythm that suits him, he is fine. We will go to Class Two and see what happens, see if we can get a run.\u201d\n\nKept safe at $5.70, Aerohappiness finished strongly to hold off $3.50 favourite Mr Croissant and win the Class Three Grand Seiko Excellent Handicap (1,200m).\n\nGold mounts Melbourne Cup charge\n\nFormer Hong Kong galloper Gold Mount is on track for a berth in the Melbourne Cup after running a solid 12th in the Caulfield Cup on Saturday behind Japanese invader Mer De Glace.\n\nThe seven-year-old, who was trained by Richard Gibson at Sha Tin until being sent back to England in March, finished 4.4 lengths off the winner and jockey Mark du Plessis sees it as a nice stepping stone to the first Tuesday in November.\n\n\u201cHe went really good. He got a lovely run, settled good, finished it off good. Should be a good [Melbourne] Cup prep,\u201d Du Plessis said.\n\nThe international raiders have started their assault on the spring carnival.\n\n\n\nJapanese Mer De Glace produced a superb staying performance to win the Caulfield Cup. pic.twitter.com/9EaX1n7PbH \u2014 7HorseRacing (@7horseracing) October 19, 2019\n\nStar French jockey Christophe Lemaire, who won the 2011 Melbourne Cup aboard Dunaden, has been booked to ride Gold Mount in the race.\n\nFinishing half a length ahead of Gold Mount was Red Verdon, who is owned by former Hong Kong Jockey Club chairman Ronald Arculli.\n\nRed Verdon sits 26th in the order of entry for the Melbourne Cup, two spots ahead of Gold Mount, and jockey Pat Cosgrave was happy with Saturday\u2019s effort.\n\n\u201cHe ran well. It got a little messy in the straight but a nice run, I thought,\u201d Cosgrave said.", "description": "After four placings at Sha Tin on Sunday, Aldo Domeyer is hungry for a winner at Happy Valley on Wednesday night before he jets off to South Africa on indefinite leave to join his girlfriend Sharna and meet his third child....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/20/e1fd12b6-f337-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_213032.JPG?itok=QeU2nE78&v=1571578241", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
