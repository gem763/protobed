They embarked on that journey to watch Ryan Zimmerman, the first draft pick in Nationals history who just three months earlier had battled alongside them in the NCAA tournament.\n\nAs Zimmerman\u2019s friends traveled up the road, they noticed something outside the window that left them stunned: freshly minted billboards with Zimmerman\u2019s face plastered on them, heralding him far more than the typical rookie. Sean Doolittle, a Virginia pitcher who is now a Nationals reliever, remembers the trips well.\n\n\u201cHere he was,\u201d Doolittle said, \u201cbeing anointed the face of this new franchise.\u201d\n\nFourteen years later, that description remains true. Zimmerman never left Washington, appearing for the Nationals in every season of their existence following their relocation from Montreal. He lasted through two general managers, seven field managers and two home ballparks. He saw the up-and-down tenure of Jayson Werth, the hype surrounding Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper. He survived seven straight seasons that ended before the playoffs and endured the heartbreak of four embarrassing early October exits. If it happened to the Nationals, Zimmerman lived it.\n\nBut now Zimmerman, 35 years old and approaching free agency, finds himself in an unprecedented position that he feared might never arrive: preparing for a long-awaited World Series. It\u2019s the first involving an entrant from the city of Washington since the Senators fell to the New York Giants in 1933. The Nationals earned their place there by sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals out of the National League Championship Series in front of a delirious sellout crowd Tuesday night.\n\nFinally, the Nationals gave Mr. National a team worthy of that name.\n\n\u201cA lot of people play for as long as I have and don\u2019t get a chance to do this, so I still consider myself pretty lucky,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cBut it definitely makes it a little bit sweeter.\u201d\n\nInjuries prevented Zimmerman from fulfilling his full potential, most notably the shoulder condition that forced him to move across the diamond to first base in 2015. He averaged 92 games from 2014 through 2019. Despite that, he owns a lifetime batting average of .279, to go along with 270 home runs and 1,015 RBIs. Jim Riggleman, Zimmerman\u2019s manager from 2009 to 2011, insists that a healthy Zimmerman \u201cwould have been a candidate for the Hall of Fame.\u201d\n\nHe looks healthy now, fully capable of helping the Nationals. He went 9-for-31 (.290) with five RBIs from the wild card game through the NLCS. On the field after the final out Tuesday, managing principal owner Mark Lerner made sure that Zimmerman touched the NLCS trophy first.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have a finer individual representing the Nats,\u201d Lerner said.\n\nWashington Nationals manager Dave Martinez and Ryan Zimmerman celebrate after Game 4 of the NLCS.

The player they chose needed to invigorate a new fan base in a jilted market that lost the second incarnation of the Senators in 1972. A bust could\u2019ve derailed the trajectory of the club in its infancy.\n\nIn a class of future stars that included Ryan Braun, Troy Tulowitzki and Andrew McCutchen, Nationals GM Jim Bowden thought other available players had more upside than Zimmerman. Zimmerman felt like the safest option, a prospect all but certain to pan out, if not excel. Bowden predicted a .280 average, 20 homers and Gold Glove-caliber defense at third. It didn\u2019t hurt that Zimmerman grew up in Virginia Beach, Va., adding a hometown element to the selection.\n\n\u201cHe was the lowest risk baseball-wise,\u201d Bowden said. \u201cWe knew this was the guy we could build around, a \u2018cover of the yearbook and media guide\u2019 guy.\u201d\n\nZimmerman justified Bowden\u2019s confidence in him. He drove in 110 runs in his first full season in 2006, followed by a 91-RBI campaign in 2007. In 2008, Zimmerman christened Nationals Park on its opening night by slamming a walk-off home run, one of his 15 walk-off hits, more than any active player other than Albert Pujols.\n\nUnfortunately, almost nobody else on the roster provided much support. The Nationals were bad at the beginning, bottoming out with just 59 wins in 2008 and 2009. Manny Acta, the manager from 2007 into 2009, said that \u201cat times, we felt it was Zim and the rest.\u201d\n\nThe struggles didn\u2019t stop Zimmerman from committing to the Nationals. In April 2009, he signed a $45 million extension that bought out two years of free agency. Then in February 2012, before the Nationals ever finished with a record above .500 and two years before he hit the open market, Zimmerman signed a $100 million deal that linked player and team forever.\n\nTom Hagan, his teammate at Virginia and now one of his representatives at Creative Artists Agency, said Zimmerman \u201cknew they were building something special.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was never another choice,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cIt was a no-brainer for me to stay here.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals rewarded Zimmerman\u2019s faith by showing the fruits of their rebuild. Because of their ineptitude, the Nationals secured the first overall draft pick twice, in 2009 and 2010. It came at the right time: They landed Strasburg and Harper in consecutive Junes, giving Zimmerman pieces worth putting around him.\n\nAnd on Oct. 1, 2012, an Atlanta loss clinched the Nationals\u2019 first division title. When the news reached the dugout in Washington, Zimmerman threw his head back, raised his arms and let out a scream.\n\n\u201cI took that as total release for him after all the losing,\u201d said Bob Carpenter, the Nationals\u2019 television play-by-play announcer since 2006.\n\nThe release quickly turned into another form of frustration, as the Nationals commenced to lose in the division series four times, developing into the sport\u2019s most notorious chokers. Managers came and went, from Davey Johnson to Matt Williams to Dusty Baker to Dave Martinez. They wouldn\u2019t shed that reputation until this season, when, despite starting a dismal 19-31, they rebounded to claim an NL wild-card spot and storm through the playoffs.\n\nRyan Zimmerman will be a free agent after the season but wants to remain in Washington.

But that doesn\u2019t concern Zimmerman right now. Four victories separate the face of the franchise from a World Series championship, the ultimate prize the Nationals believe he deserves.\n\n\u201cI was 20 years old when I got here. We were not very good,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cMe, the fans, the community are kind of one, and they deserve this just as much as we do.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "description": "Ryan Zimmerman survived seven straight seasons that ended before the playoffs and endured the heartbreak of four embarrassing early October exits.
