It suggests that the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen was illegal. She has been cynically manipulated in her 94th year. He must apologise to her and resign as her first minister. As lord president of the council and leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg should also apologise to her and resign that first role, probably also the second, unless he wants to be remembered as the mis-leader of the House. Or else the Tory party is doomed.\n\nPhilip Mitchell\n\nWinchester\n\nFor services to stubborn selfishness\n\nAfter following cricket for more than 45 years, I can confidently say that the last cricketer from England or Wales that should receive a knighthood is Geoffrey Boycott.\n\nIf our former prime minister knows anything about cricket, she would know that he was considered a selfish player by his peers and, in my opinion, everyone \u2013 including casual followers \u2013 knew he was the antithesis of a team-player.\n\nPerhaps Theresa May was heavily occupied at the Maidenhead jumble sale when news of his domestic violence conviction was announced in 1998 (which he has always denied). Likewise, her advisers. Or maybe she just ignored them. My money would be on the latter.\n\nLet us hope that this example of another dreadful honour is shortly rescinded.\n\nRobert Boston\n\nKingshill\n\nHarman for speaker\n\nAlthough there are some very good candidates for the role as the new speaker, my vote would go to Harriet Harman, the mother of the house.\n\nI feel she would be unifying force and has certainly earned this prestigious job by her unstinting tenure in the House of Commons as a longstanding MP and former minister.\n\nI will personally miss John Bercow and his unstuffy modus operandi. As a compulsive viewer of BBC Parliament, I always found him worth paying my licence fee for. But there are new challenges coming up and I think Harman will fit the bill, although she might have to practice her \u201corder, order\u201d to control the ever increasing and noisy rabble to sit on these revered benches.\n\nJudith A Daniels\n\nGreat Yarmouth\n\nHow to solve knife crime\n\nOne way to reduce the heinous level of knife crime is to ban the sale of all pointed knives. The purpose of a knife is to be used as a cutting utensil; there is no purpose in having a pointed end. If all knives were designed with blunt, curved ends, the number of knife crimes can only reduce.\n\nChristopher Learmont-Hughes\n\nWirral\n\nBring back pens and paper\n\nI was mesmerised by your report on the need to thwart cheating in exams. The advancement of technology has unleashed a barrage of exam malpractice. I feel nostalgic about the old days when pen and paper examinations were the norm. Now some universities, presumably in their pursuit of cash, facilitate cheating by asking students to submit essays and dissertations online without examinations as part of their degrees, not knowing whether assignments are done by students or others. Time to restore trust in the examination system.\n\nMunjed Farid Al Qutob\n\nLondon NW2", "description": "\u201cTrust the people\u201d was the momentary empty slogan of convenience for the prime ministerial cronies.
