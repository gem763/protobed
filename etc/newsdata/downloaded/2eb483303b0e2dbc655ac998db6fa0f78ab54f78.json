REUTERS/Fred Greaves\n\nBrown cast the partnership as a way for the United States and China, the world\u2019s two biggest emitters of heat-trapping gases, to work together even as President Donald Trump steps back from global cooperation on climate change and engages in a trade war with Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe climate threat doesn\u2019t respect borders and it doesn\u2019t pause for politics,\u201d Brown said in an interview. \u201cThis will be the open channel between America and China on the number one topic our countries share \u2013 not trade but climate change.\u201d\n\nThe two-time Democratic California governor announced the California-China Climate Institute alongside China\u2019s top climate change official Xie Zhenhua. The institute, chaired by Brown, will focus on advancing research on electric and hydrogen cars, other low-carbon transportation technology, climate-smart agriculture, and policy proposals, they said.\n\nThe launch was timed to coincide with the United Nations Climate Summit in New York attended by leaders from about 60 countries and meant to ramp up global ambition to stem global warming.\n\nTrump, who has questioned mainstream climate science and sought to undo Obama-era climate protections to boost the American economy, is skipping the event.\n\nThe Trump administration last week also revoked California\u2019s authority here to set its own greenhouse gas and vehicle fuel efficiency standards, an action expected to hobble efforts at cutting carbon emissions from cars.\n\nStates following California\u2019s standards have accounted for more than 40% of U.S. vehicle sales.\n\nBrown said China is on the verge of leadership on electric cars and will benefit from working with California.\n\n\u201cChina is investing money in electric cars while Trump is trying to undermine California\u2019s authority. He is making a bet on the past by imposing gas guzzlers on Americans rather than something that is more innovative and elegant,\u201d Brown said.\n\nHe added that California and China would also \u201cwork on models for cap-and-trade\u201d. Both already have in place emissions trading systems aimed at lowering emissions.", "description": "Former California Governor Jerry Brown on Monday announced the launch of a partnership between China and the University of California at Berkeley to advance research into low-carbon technology to fight climate change.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433061304&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1TW", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
