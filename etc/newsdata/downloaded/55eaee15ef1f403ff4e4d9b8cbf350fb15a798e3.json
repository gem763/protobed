An earlier court ruling suggests she is now 20. But according to the Barnetts she would be 30 today.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nAfter being charged with neglect, Kristine, 45, claimed that Natalia was a sociopath pretending to be a child and tried to kill her family in a plot mirroring the horror film The Orphan.\n\nHer ex-husband Michael, 43, made similar claims as he spoke out for the first time on The Dr Oz Show, a US daytime TV programme, in an episode due to air on Tuesday.\n\nBut prosecutors claim Natalia was a minor and dependent when they left her to fend for herself in a rented flat.\n\n(Image: Tippecanoe County Jail)\n\nThe couple face up to five years in prison if convicted.\n\nMichael claims Natalia was abusive towards Kristine, who was \"stunned\" and \"appalled\" after she was allegedly struck.\n\nHe told host Mehmet Oz: \"We came home and we did what we thought was best and what most parents would do in that situation.\n\n(Image: Tippecanoe County Jail)\n\n\"We took (Natalia) to the hospital, we took her to the stress centre to have her evaluated that she is having thoughts of harming others and she is stating out loud that she is attempting to kill Kristine.\n\n\"While at the stress centre, she was documenting, she was telling doctors, she was telling therapists, she was writing down on her notepad.\n\n\"Not only am I trying to kill Kristine, but I'm going to kill the brothers, too.\n\n\"Here's how I'm going to do it. Here's what I'm going to do with their bodies.\u201d\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nHe claims Natalia successfully lived alone for a full year.\n\nNatalia is now living with Antwon Mans, a 36-year-old pastor, his wife Cynthia, 39, and their five children in Lafayette.\n\nKristine sensationally claims Natalia threatened to stab her and her then-husband in their sleep, pushed her towards an electric fence and poured bleach in her coffee.\n\nKristine recently told DailyMailTV: \"She would make statements and draw pictures saying she wanted to kill family members, roll them up in a blanket and put them in the backyard.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nIn a previous interview with WISH-TV, Kristine claimed Natalia - who has a bone disorder, spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia - was diagnosed as both a psychopath and sociopath.\n\nKristine denied accusations that she neglected Natalia.\n\nShe claims doctors examined Natalia and concluded she was suffering a severe psychological illness only diagnosed in adults.\n\nKristine alleges the illness led to Natalia jumping from moving cars and smearing blood over mirrors.\n\nThe Barnetts were featured in a 60 Minutes report in 2012 that highlighted their son Jacob, a physics prodigy with an IQ higher than Albert Einstein.", "description": "Michael Barnett, who has been charged with neglect along with his ex-wife Kristine, is breaking his silence on The Dr Oz Show, claiming his adopted daughter Natalia was a sociopath pretending to be a child", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Kristine Barnett", "Zoco Productions", "Llc", "Facebook", "Tippecanoe County Jail"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20163218.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_She-tried-to-kill-us-Indiana-mother-who-adopted-6-year-old-Ukrainian-girl-with-dwarfism-has-been.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
