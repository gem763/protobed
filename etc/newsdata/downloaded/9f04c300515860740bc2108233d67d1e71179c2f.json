she's had two herself - so it was no surprise to see her turning up first at Jennifer Lawrence rehearsal dinner last night.\n\nThe Kardashian matriarch was spotted leading the celebrity arrivals on the dock in Newport, where shuttle boats were hired to speed them over to Rose Island.\n\nThat's where Jennifer and her art dealer fiance Cooke Maroney will tie the knot later today, surrounded by 150 of their closest friends and family.\n\nAmong the star-studded arrivals spotted hitting up the boats last night were J-Law's BFF Adele - with who she shared THAT wild hen party in New York earlier this year - along with Cameron Diaz and her rocker husband Benji Madden.\n\n(Image: T.JACKSON / BACKGRID)\n\nNicole Richie also arrived under the cover of darkness and was whisked away on the shuttle boat over to the 18.5-acre island in the Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island.\n\nThe island, which is only accessible by boat, boasts beautiful a forest and beaches that wrap around its parameter.\n\nIt also features a lighthouse which can be hired for a night or a week for those wishing to experience life as a lighthouse keeper.\n\nKris opted for comfort over glitz and glam as she headed down the dock towards the boat.\n\nShe wore a $4,850 (\u00a33,690) black Tom Ford faux fur hooded coat over a casual grey v-neck jumper and casual trousers, pushing her hands into her pockets to ward off the chill.\n\n(Image: Richard Harbus / MEGA)\n\n(Image: Richard Harbus / MEGA)\n\nKris finished off her dressed-down look with a black polo neck jumper and matching lace-up ankle boots, plus a pair of diamond stud earrings to ensure she travelled in style.\n\nShe was joined by bodyguards who accompanied her down the dock towards the boat.\n\nCameron also opted for comfort when she arrived with Good Charlotte rocker Benji a little later in the evening.\n\nShe was spotted with her blonde hair swept back into a high ponytail and chose a long dark winter coat, yoga pants and a pair of white sneakers as she and her husband made their way over to the island.\n\nAdele went for a splash of colour as she joined the couple on the dock, wearing a purple coat and black trainers as she followed a staffer carrying an umbrella to shield the celebrities from prying eyes.\n\n(Image: Richard Harbus / MEGA)\n\nThe stars were treated to a luxurious rehearsal dinner thrown by the bride and groom on Friday night, as they prepare to marry today at the Belcourt Of Newport castle.\n\nThe Louis XIII style mansion has been taking delivery of food, drinks, furniture and entertainment all week, with a large marquee set up nearby where guests will be able to dance and party long into the night right by the water's edge.\n\nJennifer and Cooke were also spotted leaving their New York apartment yesterday afternoon as they made their way to Rhode Island.\n\nJ-Law looked casual in a bronze silk skirt, oersized beige roll-neck jumper and a pair of soft fawn loafers, emerging with a heavy camel-toned winter coat flung over her arm and round sunglasses.\n\nHer husband-to-be looked just as casual in grey trousers, a pair of navy sneakers, a jumper and a sports coat worn open.\n\n(Image: Richard Harbus / MEGA)\n\n(Image: Richard Harbus / MEGA)\n\nThe pair only went public with their engagement in February, having met in May 2018 through their mutual friend Laura Simpson.\n\nAccording to TMZ , the happy couple have enlisted the help of celebrity wedding planner Mark Seed, who operates in near-secrecy for his high-profile clients.\n\nMark has been coordinating the luxurious food and drink that the guests will be treated to on Saturday, including hors d'oeuvres to start them off.\n\nWait staff will offer up sweet potato flat cakes, brussels sprouts with cured egg yolk, smoked pork belly with pickled apple, and salt cod beignets (like doughnuts but savoury).\n\nOnce the guests are seated, they'll be treated to main courses of either wood-roasted fish with herbs and lemon-infused butter, or leg of five-week-aged beef with forager's sauce - very seasonal.\n\n(Image: GoffPhotos.com)\n\nThere's also smoked new potatoes, whey-braised cabbage and roasted heirloom carrots to wow their tastebuds.\n\nThe happy couple have picked out their favourite desserts to serve at the reception, too, with guests given the option of a fire-baked bread pudding with chocolate, salted caramel and fresh apple, sweet cauldron fritters with bourbon cream and cinnamon sugar, or marshmallow s'mores that they can roast themselves.\n\nThere's literally no way anyone will be able to stand up and dance over that feast, but they might just about find room for a glass or five of the couple's custom-designed cocktails - a bourbon Old Fashioned or gin cucumber lavender champagne.", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence and her husband-to-be Cooke Maroney celebrated their wedding rehearsal dinner in style surrounded by famous guests", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "T.Jackson", "Backgrid", "Richard Harbus", "Mega", "Goffphotos.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652292.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Kris-Jenner-heads-to-Jennifer-Lawrences-rehearsal-dinner.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
