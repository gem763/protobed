A likely short list of five bidders will be selected in January and they will have to produce final bids in February.\n\nA contract is due to be signed before the end of the financial year.\n\nBidders say they are being asked to prepare tenders based on two prices - one for taking the risk of moving the transport and utility infrastructure associated with the site, and another on the basis of state government taking that risk.\n\nOvershadowing requirements for the Birrarung Marr public park on the banks of the Yarra river could influence the size of any project. While some bidders say the overshadowing constraints limit the size of the three possible towers to between 15 and 22 storeys, others say the overshadowing requirements aren't mandatory.\n\n\"It's a discretionary thing; you might get more,'' one person said.", "description": "At a time of few sites and plentiful capital, surplus railway land offers a lucrative development opportunity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2149%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_97/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e16e952552a4ae81f303b0ee7cdeaecb4baa51ce", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
