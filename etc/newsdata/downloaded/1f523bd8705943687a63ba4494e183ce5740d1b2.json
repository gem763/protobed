Ankara said its military operation was launched to implement a \u201csafe zone\u201d along its border with Syria, free of SDF fighters.\n\nBut the SDF \u2013 a mostly Kurdish militia with a smaller Arab contingent \u2013 has been a key ally of the US in the fight against Isis. The presence of US troops in Syria alongside the group had acted as a deterrence for a Turkish assault. That changed quickly last week when Donald Trump made a shock announcement that the US would not stand in the way of Turkey\u2019s plans to enter Syria. The SDF described the abrupt shift as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d.\n\nThe deal will see the Syrian army deployed along a large stretch of the Turkey-Syria border, the SDF said, in an effort to deter any further Turkish incursion.\n\nThe agreement brings its own dangers, however. For decades, Kurds in Syria have faced repression and discrimination at the hands of the government. Although the civil war had caused great upheaval for the community, it has also allowed them to win new freedoms, which may now be lost again.\n\nThe SDF currently controls around a third of Syrian territory in the north and east of the country.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
