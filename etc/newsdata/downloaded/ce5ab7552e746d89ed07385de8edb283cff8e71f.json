We have a big job to do in a really difficult league. Everybody thinks we should be first or second, so we have to play the football for it.\n\nRoberto Firmino rises above Chelsea to keep up Liverpool\u2019s perfect start Read more\n\n\u201cWe just play football to win games. Without character life is difficult but football is impossible, The boys fought really hard. There is no other way to win here. It\u2019s a big one.\u201d\n\nLiverpool, who have won their first six league games, were under pressure following City\u2019s 8-0 victory over Watford 24 hours earlier. \u201cI really think they are the best team in the world,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put pressure on Pep but they are brilliant in moments.\n\n\u201cWe are not bad as well. I still don\u2019t see that in the end it is only two teams. We talk about the championship with 32 games to go. That\u2019s a bit early.\u201d\n\nLiverpool, who will assess Sadio Man\u00e9 after the forward suffered a knock, won only one away game against their big six rivals last season. \u201cWe reacted well, adapted well to different situations and I think we were deserved winners today,\u201d Klopp said.\n\nFrank Lampard was frustrated after Chelsea were left with nothing to show for a fine effort. His side have conceded 13 goals already, lie in 11th place and are yet to win a home game this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a concern,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cThe difference between us and Liverpool is that we aren\u2019t consistently as good as them and Manchester City. The home win will come. Hopefully it comes very soon and it will bring confidence to everybody but we need to aspire to a level like Liverpool when they probably don\u2019t play their best but they win the game.\u201d\n\nLampard added that Emerson Palmieri went off with a muscle problem and that Andreas Christensen suffered a knee injury during the first half.", "description": "The Liverpool manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, assessed their 2-1 win by saying: \u2018We expect to fight for everything,\u2019 while Frank Lampard admitted: \u2018No home win so far is a concern\u2019", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg At Stamford Bridge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b416fb1a6c5f162b0373d015b60f561567968d8f/0_51_3043_1826/master/3043.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=05dde58bc01b9fe9bdede56aeb9dc179", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
