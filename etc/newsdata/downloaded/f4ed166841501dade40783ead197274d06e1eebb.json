They don\u2019t say anything back. They won\u2019t groan when you tell them it\u2019s going to rain, or smile when you tell a joke.\n\nAt the same time, those early weeks are shrouded in a cloud of exhaustion. My baby didn\u2019t sleep when he was meant to, which meant I couldn\u2019t either. It\u2019s no wonder that conversation wasn\u2019t exactly flowing.\n\nIt starts to feel easier when they become more responsive, but it still didn\u2019t come naturally to me to \u201ccoo\u201d in response to my baby\u2019s gurgles, or speak in \u201cbaby-ese\u201d with big, loud, slow vowel sounds. I would often look in awe as other, seemingly more parental types, would have whole conversations with my baby.\n\nA few months in, as babies start to respond more with babbles and giggles, it becomes easier. But studies show that some parent still do not speak to their children much, and that this can have lasting negative consequences \u2013 consequences even visible in the brain.\n\nIt was in the mid-1990s that a worrying discovery was made about a stark difference in language achievement in children. Researchers Betty Hart and Todd Risley went into homes of families from different socioeconomic groups, spending an hour each month recording them over more than two years.\n\nAnalysing the data, they found that children from the poorest backgrounds heard one-third as many words per hour as those from higher income backgrounds. Scaling up, they proposed that by the time the children were four years old, there would be a 30-million word gap between children from poor backgrounds compared to those in wealthier, professional households.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The secret world of babies\n\n\u2022 How to be a good father\n\n\u2022 The hidden bias we often ignore\n\nThis study was far from ideal. It had a small sample size, and it\u2019s not clear if the word gap is as large as the researchers first suggested. Other critics have since shown that low-income children hear many more words than Hart and Risley reported when factoring in language they overhear from conversations both inside and outside the home. Responding to these critics, another group highlighted that \u201cyoung children do not profit from overheard speech about topics of interest to adults\u201d.\n\nIf this \u201cword gap\u201d does exist, it is problematic because language is known to be one of the most important predictors of how you are going to do later in life, from your earliest school years to university and in turn, your career. In order to read, learn basic numeracy and even to articulate memories, you need language.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s not where it needs to be, you\u2019re already starting at the race behind,\u201d says Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, who directs the Temple University Infant Language Laboratory in Philadelphia.\n\nThis lag also plays out in the brain. Neuroscientists are now able to show how the brain responds to early language exposure. One group, led by Rachel Romeo, a neuroscientist and speech language pathologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, showed that conversational interactions can have a visible benefit on brain development. The team recorded conversations in families\u2019 homes monitoring both the amount of language they were exposed to and the number of conversational turns. Children who had more turn-taking conversations were better at language comprehension tasks.\n\nThese children also had stronger white matter connections in the brain in two major areas important for language, an increase that could speed up processing in these areas. This, says Romeo, shows that conversational turns contribute to brain development. \u201cWe found that more conversation correlated with stronger connections in this pathway, which in turn related to children's language skills,\u201d Romeo says.\n\nIndeed, a large body of evidence shows that it is not passive hearing \u2013 or even the amount of words a child is exposed to \u2013 that matters most. Instead it is the quality of the conversation that is important. That is, the back and forth, turn-taking nature that requires listening and responding. It\u2019s what Hirsh-Pasek and her long-time collaborator Roberta Golinkoff refer to as a \u201cconversational duet\u201d, because \u201cyou can\u2019t sing it alone\u201d. In fact, another study found that if a conversation is interrupted by a phone call, the child does not learn a newly presented word, but will learn it if the conversation is not interrupted.\n\nRomeo\u2019s team went one step further in a small follow-up study that helped parents understand the importance of turn-taking conversations. In this group, they found increases in grey matter in language and social regions of the children\u2019s brains.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a coincidence,\u201d she says. It makes sense that the social and language areas of the brain are \u201ccoming together\u201d in these child-parent relationships, as language underpins our social relationships, and both are fundamental for how we learn. \u201cWe have this human desire to communicate,\u201d she says. \u201cOn top of that we build our language skills and those language skills add a foundation for higher level cognition.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, another group, this one at the Princeton Baby Lab, monitored babies and experimenters\u2019 brains to find that when they were engaging in interactive play, such as singing or reading, their brain activation patterns started to converge. In other words, their brains \u201cbecome coupled together\u201d, explains Elise Piazza of the Princeton University Neuroscience Institute, the lead author of the work. At other times when taking part in separate activities, the \u201cneural synchrony\u201d between their brains disappeared, she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if you become so tuned in that you\u2019re operating not as two people, but as one. That\u2019s where we believe the learning gets heightened and takes place, and that\u2019s what conversation brings you,\u201d Hirsh-Pasek says of the work.\n\nSocioeconomic status\n\nGiven how important conversations are from such a young age, how worried should we be about the \u201cword gap\u201d \u2013 and where does it come from?\n\nEven if Hart and Risley\u2019s study wasn\u2019t perfect, the idea that a significant socioeconomic gap exists has been replicated by dozens of studies. In 2008, for example, Meredith Rowe of Harvard University found that types of conversations do differ significantly between low- and high-income families \u2013 in part due to the differing levels of education reached by the parents in these groups.\n\nIn other words, \u201cparenting knowledge\u201d contributes positively to vocabulary development, says Rowe. In this study, higher-income parents used longer sentences and more vocabulary than the lower-income parents. \u201cThe key finding here was that the influence of poverty on how parents communicated with their children was explained by how much the parents knew about child development,\u201d she says.\n\nIf there is any association between socioeconomic status and verbal abilities, it may be because poverty is linked to both lower levels of education as well as to greater stress. Both factors mean the quality of conversations can suffer.\n\nBut socioeconomic status isn\u2019t determinism.\n\nIn one 2015 study, Hirsh-Pasek and colleagues looked at the speech of 60 children, all from low-income families, at age two; they returned one year later to see how these children had developed. As anticipated, the children who were taking part in more conversations at two had more advanced language one year later. Those who had fewer conversations scored worse on language ability.\n\nAs these children were all from lower-income backgrounds, the results show that poverty alone is not what predisposes a child to poorer language skills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about whether you were born into an under-resourced environment, but it's how you interact with your child in that environment that seems to make a difference,\u201d says Hirsh-Pasek.\n\nThough a word gap can have lasting consequences, the good news is that all parents talk to their children at least some of the time. If parents understand that quality interactions are more important than quantity, then all children could benefit.\n\nThe more social experiences they have, whether with their parents or with any other caregivers around them, the more they will learn, she adds.\n\nThere are other ways to help speed this process along, too. Parental coaching is effective, but it is time consuming and expensive. Fortunately, there are other simple, tried-and-tested ways that help encourage more quality conversations.\n\nHirsh-Pasek and colleagues have shown that in under-resourced communities in some of the poorest neighbourhoods of Philadelphia, putting prompts in supermarkets increases meaningful conversation by as much as 33%. These could be as simple as colourful posters asking questions like \u201cWhere does milk come from?\u201d and \u201cWhat is your favourite vegetable?\u201d.\n\nI visited several sites in Philadelphia \u2013 including at a bus stop, as well as a playground at a library and at human-sized board games in Philadelphia\u2019s Please Touch children\u2019s museum \u2013 where Hirsh-Pasek and her team are trying another approach. Here they use games to encourage several important aspects of learning, from the social to the cognitive, from impulse control (hop scotch) to executive function (problem-solving games). Crucially, they were carefully placed in areas where people already gather in groups. And though the games are geared towards children, they were remarkably fun for us adults too.\n\nThe project, called \u201cPlayful Learning Landscapes\u201d, involved collaborating with city councils and architects to \u201ctransform everyday places into learning opportunities\u201d. What\u2019s more, close monitoring by nearby researchers showed that some of these projects helped increase conversations by 30-55%. \u201cAs an added gift, when you make these environments interesting, their parents are more likely to put their cell phones down, look in the eyes of their child and have a meaningful conversation,\u201d says Hirsh-Pasek. \u201cImagine what we could do if we made the world just a little bit more fun.\u201d With enough will, the researchers say it should be easy to recreate similar spaces in many other cities.\n\nIn the UK, the government has launched a related project online, where simple prompts encourage parents to talk to their children more. Hungry Little Minds is a three-year campaign with the aim \u201cto encourage parents to engage in activities that support their child\u2019s early learning and help set them up for school and beyond\u201d.\n\nFor some, the stress of day-to-day life can leave less time for talk and play. But it is now clear that subtle tweaks in how we speak to children \u2013 and how we listen \u2013 can literally grow their brains for the better.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, I now find myself thinking about my baby\u2019s brain patterns as I coo and speak to him, telling him snippets about my day but also asking him questions to see how he responds. Often I\u2019m greeted with a toothless grin. Other times he doesn\u2019t respond at all. But even so, now I know that his brain may well be growing because of it, something all of us, whether parents or caregivers, can play a crucial part in.\n\n--\n\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cThe Essential List\u201d.
