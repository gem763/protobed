But we stayed friends.\u201d\n\nSuzanne has four daughters, Rebecca, 26, Lauren 23, Megan, 22, and 13-year-old Hannah.\n\nShe said: \u201cI was diagnosed with cancer in August last year, a month after my 50th birthday.\n\n\"Around February time I had a feeling something was wrong, I had a strong feeling something was not right.\n\n\u201cAfter my 50th in July I felt something, a lump. I\u2019m kicking myself now, I wish I\u2019d acted earlier, but I just thought \u2018it can\u2019t happen to me\u2019.\n\n\"But in August I felt the lump and I panicked. I was at the doctors the next morning at 8.30.\u201d\n\n(Image: wayne Perry)\n\nSuzanne was referred to the Mermaid breast cancer clinic at the Royal Cornwall Hospital.\n\n\u201cI got an appointment incredibly quickly. When I saw the doctor I said \u2018it\u2019s probably just a cyst\u2019, but I could tell from the look on his face.\n\n\"They deal with this day in, day out, they know what they\u2019re looking for.\n\n\u201cIt felt so surreal, horrendous. You think \u2018I\u2019ve got cancer, i\u2019m going to die\u2019. It\u2019s like a grieving process for yourself.\u201d\n\nSuzanne had a mammogram, ultrasound treatment and a biopsy - and 10 days later received the terrible confirmation it was cancer.\n\nShe said: \u201cI went to see the consultant and he said they\u2019d found cancerous cells. It was horrific, I went cold from head to toe.\n\n\u201cThey kept saying it was very treatable, but I was just thinking \u2018that\u2019s it\u2019. Then I thought \u2018am I going to lose my hair\u2019. There are so many emotions all at once.\n\n\u201cIt was torture, the mental side is so difficult. How do I tell the children? My youngest Hannah was only 13 and she\u2019d see me crying at home. It was fear of the unknown.\u201d\n\nSuzanne started her chemotherapy on October 4 last year with daughter Lauren, 23, taking her to her first couple of treatments.\n\nBut then she received a surprise call - from her ex-husband\u2019s new wife Paula.\n\nShe said: \u201cUntil then it had been very hard, I felt alone. I needed reassurance that my girls would be ok.\n\n\u201cWhen Paula heard about the chemo sessions she insisted on taking me. I\u2019d already had a couple and she called me and said she was available to drive me there.\n\n\"She told me she and Chris were devastated when they heard about the diagnosis.\u201d\n\nThe first time Paula took Suzanne to her chemotherapy she sat holding her hand and the two women had an emotional heart-to-heart.\n\nSuzanne said: \u201cWe\u2019d always had a cordial, friendly relationship, mostly greeting each other at family events. But this was different.\n\n\u201cShe said to me the girls were going to be fine and I was going to be fine. She told me \u2018I will never replace you, you are their mum, but I will love them and look after them like they are my own\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt was just what I needed to hear, she\u2019s just a lovely, lovely person.\u201d\n\nFrom there on Suzanne and Paula became close pals.\n\nSuzanne, a dog groomer, said: \u201cWhile I was receiving treatment Paula would come over and see me.\n\n\"She would bundle me in the car and take me to their house. Or, if I was feeling too ill, she would bring her laptop and work from mine, even if I just spent the day sleeping.\n\n\u201cShe would make sure I had the shopping in, cook meals. The girls would be there, the grandchildren, the family all together.\n\n\u201cIt felt like I wasn\u2019t having to deal with it on my own. I love her to bits, she\u2019s amazing.\n\n\u201cIt may have seemed a bit odd for Chris, but he\u2019s always been very supportive. He\u2019s a fantastic dad and even though we\u2019re divorced I still care for him.\n\n\u201cIf it had been the other way round I would have been devastated for him. In a strange way I think our friendship helped him deal with it as well.\u201d\n\n(Image: Wayne Perry)\n\nSuzanne\u2019s treatment ended on Valentine\u2019s Day this year - and the whole family, including Chris and Paula, visited the hospital to see her ring the bell as she left the unit.\n\nShe has since undergone an operation to remove the lump and has been told she is now cancer free.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still coming to terms with life afterwards, it\u2019s been mentally exhausting. I\u2019ll still need annual checks, but I\u2019m just so thankful that i\u2019m healthy and I now have such a wonderful friend.\u201d\n\nTechnical administrator Paula, 49, said: \u201cWe\u2019d always got on, at birthdays or christenings, family events. But when we got the phone call telling us Suzanne had cancer I was in tears.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only 17 months between us and I knew I wanted to help. I didn\u2019t want to be one of those people who crosses the street.\n\n\u201cWe spoke on the phone and I went round. I told her that I wanted to take her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never been in a ward before where people were having chemo. It was a real shock seeing what she was going through. All these people linked up to drips.\n\n\u201cIt was a humbling, eye opening experience. We spoke while she was having her treatment. I told her she\u2019d be OK, but if the worst happened I\u2019d be there for the girls. Afterwards I dropped her off and then I cried all the way home.\u201d\n\nPaula told how they grew closer as Suzanne\u2019s treatment continued.\n\n\u201cI would take her to hospital, spend time at her house, or wrap her up and bring her to ours.\n\n\u201cThe girls would come round and she would fall asleep on our sofa, surrounded by everyone.\n\n\u201cI think these moments with the family were precious to her. They meant a lot to all of us.\u201d\n\nChris, 55, an upholsterer, said: \u201cIt was a little bit weird when the girls started seeing so much of each other. Some guys may not be like this, but I still care for Suzanne, she\u2019s the mother of my children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they get on so well, it\u2019s brilliant, it\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d\n\nOf the campaign Suzanne says. \u201cIt\u2019s given me so much confidence in myself. I\u2019m hoping to raise awareness of breast cancer for as many people as possible, and turn this experience into a positive one.\u201d\n\nTo find out how you can support the M&S and Breast Cancer Now partnership, visit: www.marksandspencer.com/breastcancernow", "description": "Paula would hold Suzanne's hand during her weekly chemotherapy sessions and promised to always be there for her daughters", "authors": ["Phil Cardy", "Image", "Wayne Perry"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20657155.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PERRY_EVANS_CANCER_011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
