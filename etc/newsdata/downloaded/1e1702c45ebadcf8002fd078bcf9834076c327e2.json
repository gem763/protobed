REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nBritain\u2019s household savings rate - a measure of how much households save from their disposable income - stands close to record low levels.\n\nHouseholds have also been net borrowers for 10 quarters in a row, an unprecedented stretch in records dating back to the 1960s.\n\nTheir lack of financial headroom could spell trouble if a downturn hits, whether triggered by events at home or abroad.\n\n\u201cIf a global economy side-swipe happens, households haven\u2019t got those rainy-day funds to use,\u201d Simon French, chief economist at merchant bank Panmure Gordon, said.\n\nBank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe has said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d that the low household savings rate could leave households vulnerable to shocks to their income or employment.\n\nThe data show why.\n\nMany factors determine how quickly a country recovers from a recession, and the household savings rate appears to be an important one.\n\nIn the financial crisis, countries that entered recession with net household savings rates above their 10-year average recovered the fastest, based on data from Refinitiv and the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nConversely, those entering the downturn with household savings rates below the 10-year average tended to take longer to recover their lost output.\n\nGraphic: Household savings and recovery from global financial crisis, here\n\nSwitzerland and New Zealand recovered fastest, within two years. Both countries entered recession with household savings rates in 2007 that were above their 10-year average.\n\nBy contrast, Spain, Portugal and Finland took longest to recover \u2014 around nine to 10 years \u2014 and had household savings rates furthest below their 10-year average in 2007.\n\nBritain, which entered recession with a slightly below-average household savings rate, was broadly in the middle of the pack in terms of recovery time, at roughly 5 years.\n\nThe analysis excluded Australia, which avoided recession, and Italy and Greece, whose economies have yet to recover to their pre-crisis sizes.\n\nThe world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy shrank in the second quarter of 2019 and the possibility of a no-deal Brexit has raised the risk of its first recession since the financial crisis, even if some of those concerns were eased last week when data showed output grew in July more strongly than expected.\n\nOn the plus side, wages in Britain are growing at their fastest pace since before the financial crisis, which should help to restore household finances.\n\nBut the broader picture still suggests Britain will need to lean on spending by the government to drive any recovery from a future recession.\n\nBritain\u2019s household savings ratio stood at 4.2% in 2018, up only slightly from the record low of 3.9% struck in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe poor savings ratio for more than two years suggests rainy day funds are thinner in UK than in other G7 countries,\u201d French from Panmure Gordon said.\n\nGraphic: UK household savings rate and recessions, here\n\nFISCAL FIREPOWER\n\nThe Resolution Foundation think-tank last week said Britain was not ready for a recession and proposed changes to the way it manages its economy to see off the downturn when it comes.\n\nIt called for a pipeline of shovel-ready infrastructure projects which could be sped up in a crisis and it said direct payments could be made to households if necessary.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man walks past houses painted in various colours in a residential street in London, Britain, May 15, 2019.
