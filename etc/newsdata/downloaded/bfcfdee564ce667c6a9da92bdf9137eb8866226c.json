Previously the decision was made only by a court.\n\nRwanda\u2019s justice minister says the women will be freed on Saturday.\n\nSome activists have criticized the penal code for prohibiting health professionals such as midwives from providing abortions since not everyone can afford to see doctors.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rwanda's president has pardoned and ordered the release of 52 young women who were jailed for having or assisting with abortions.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
