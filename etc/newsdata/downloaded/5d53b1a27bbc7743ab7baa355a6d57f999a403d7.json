For three days I was inundated with messages of support.\n\n\"We spent a lot of time out in the street speaking to people and asking for CCTV. Every message we got meant that we were pointed in a certain direction and we could eliminate other things.\"\n\nShe added: \"We pieced the puzzle together and knew he was in Possil and we were closing in. Then out of the blue, I got a message saying: 'I have your dog'.\"\n\nShe thanked everyone who helped spread the word and share her posts.\n\nPotential location\n\nShe promised to return all donations made to a fundraising page, or pass them on to an animal charity.\n\nShe told BBC Scotland news: \"I am exhausted.

Officers continue to investigate and are following a positive line of inquiry in connection with this.\"", "description": "A stolen dog has been reunited with its owners after a social media campaign brought together a community.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3780/production/_109180241_blake2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
