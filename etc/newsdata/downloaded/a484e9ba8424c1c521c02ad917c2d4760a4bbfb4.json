In addition, the authors omitted a key piece of information \u2014 the fact that the alleged victim of the incident didn\u2019t remember it \u2014 and the Times promoted the piece with a shockingly tone-deaf tweet.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAll three missteps prompted condemnation across political boundaries on Monday, while the fallout from the piece in the Times\u2019s Sunday Review has overshadowed the release Tuesday over the hotly anticipated book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump seized Monday on an editor\u2019s note attached to a piece Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s to claim it\u2019s actually Kavanaugh \u201cbeing assaulted\u201d by \u201clies and \u201cFake News!\u201d Republican Senator Ted Cruz tweeted that \u201cit\u2019s almost as if the reporters, editors, publishers have a political agenda.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, New York magazine\u2019s Rebecca Traister, a leading voice on women\u2019s issues, wrote that it was \u201cflabbergasting\u201d how the Times mishandled the new Kavanaugh reporting. \u201cI\u2019m sure someone at the Times still thinks that by some both-sides bullshit-objectivity meter it\u2019s a victory to make both conservatives and feminists livid,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s actually coming across as truly bizarre ineptitude.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Executive editor Dean Baquet, editorial page editor James Bennet, and Kelly did not respond to requests for comment. Pogrebin and Jim Dao, the op-ed editor who edited the Sunday Review piece, referred requests to the paper\u2019s public relations team.\n\nThe Times\u2019s PR team responded to a couple issues Sunday on Twitter, including a now-deleted tweet from the Opinion section promoting the piece. \u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun,\u201d it read. \u201cBut when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn\u2019t belong at Yale in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cA tweet that went out from the @NYTOpinion account yesterday was clearly inappropriate and offensive,\u201d the Times said. \u201cWe apologize for it and are reviewing the decision-making with those involved.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Times insider familiar with the matter, Pogrebin wrote the offensive tweet, which should have been vetted before it was posted.\n\n\u201cIt was really neglectful,\u201d the insider said of the paper\u2019s overall handling. \u201cThere were serious errors made along the way.\u201d\n\nThe Times\u2019s PR team also responded to questions about why a piece featuring new reporting about a controversial, national issue didn\u2019t run as a news story, but rather a \u201cnews analysis.\u201d The Sunday Review section, the Times said, \u201cfrequently runs excerpts of books produced by Times reporters.\u201d\n\nThere appears to be no hard and fast rule at the Times when it comes to its reporters\u2019 books.\n\nLast week, reporter Alexandra Alter wrote a news story on revelations from \u201cShe Said,\u201d a book by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the Times reporters who helped ignite the #MeToo movement with their reporting allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Last month, the Times Sunday business section ran an excerpt of \u201cSuper Pumped,\u201d a book on Uber by Times reporter Mike Isaac.\n\nThen-Judge Brett Kavanaugh during his tempestuous Senate confirmation. | Jim Bourg/Getty Images\n\nThe piece by Pogrebin and Kelly \u2014 \u201cBrett Kavanaugh Fit In With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not.\u201d \u2014 ran on the second page of Sunday Review and it took about 10 paragraphs before getting to potentially explosive revelations.\n\nPogrebin and Kelly reported that at least seven people had heard about an incident in which Kavanaugh put his penis in the face of Ramirez, a former Yale classmate. (The New Yorker first reported in Sept. 2018 on allegations from Ramirez, who was the second woman to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct after Christine Blasey Ford).\n\n\u201cWe also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegation,\u201d Pogrebin and Kelly wrote. \u201cA classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d\n\nStier, the CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, notified senators and the FBI, but the agency declined to investigate, they reported.\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates responded to the Times story with renewed criticism of the Kavanaugh confirmation, with some calling for him to be impeached. The Sunday Review piece came under scrutiny from others, including the author of a more favorable Kavauagh book who got an advanced look at the Times reporters\u2019 account.\n\n\u201cNYT Reporters\u2019 essay about a supposed second Yale incident omitted their own book reporting that completely undercuts it: alleged victim denies any memory of it,\u201d tweeted Mollie Hemingway, a senior editor at conservative news and opinion site The Federalist and co-author of \u201cJustice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\u201cJournalistically indefensible,\u201d she added, \u201cthough gullible additional reporters are spreading it of course.\n\nThe Times later affixed an editor\u2019s note to Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s piece to note that their \u201cbook reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.\u201d\n\nThe paper\u2019s mishandling of the new allegations seemed to confirm the view of Kavanaugh supporters that he had been railroaded by the news media. National Review editor Rich Lowry accused the Times of trying to \u201csmear\u201d Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cAfter more than a year of digging, the Democrats and their media allies still have no supported allegations of sexual misconduct,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSome do find that the book advanced the public\u2019s understanding of the Kavanaugh controversy.\n\nNew York magazine\u2019s Sarah Jones, who read the book in advance, wrote that Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s \u201creporting lends credence to many of the most serious concerns raised about Kavanaugh\u2019s suitability to serve a lifetime term on the nation\u2019s highest court.\u201d Still, Jones admitted being \u201ctruly mystified by how badly the NYT botched this book excerpt.\u201d", "description": "Editors won't explain why an explosive allegation appeared in Sunday Review, lacked a key fact and was promoted with an offensive tweet.", "authors": ["Michael Calderone"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b9/31/9ab78dbf42048ff902334e7ecfa2/190916-nyt-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
