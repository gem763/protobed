One of these species is the Rockhopper Penguin\n\nThe coins were purely commemorative - they cannot be spent either in the Falklands or Britain - and were actually produced in the UK\n\nThe four penguin species on the coins were the King, the Gentoo, the Magellanic and the Rockhopper, and 7,500 special 50p pieces featuring each species would be minted - and sold for \u00a313 each.\n\nHowever, there was a mix-up. There are two species of Rockhopper; the Northern Rockhopper and the Southern Rockhopper.\n\nOnly the latter is native to the Falkland Islands, with the Northern variety only spotted there a few times.\n\nThe Northern Rockhopper instead is commonly found nearly 4,000 kilometers away on the volcanic islands of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.\n\nSaint Helena is best known for being the spot where Napoleon Bonaparte spent the last six years of his life after being exiled by the British in 1815.\n\nIn a mix up the wrong species of Rockhopper, the Northern Rockhopper (left), was put on the coin, rather than the Southern Rockhopper\n\nOnly Southern Rockhopper penguins are native to the Falkland Islands, while Northern Rockhopper penguins are ommonly found 4,000 kilometres away on the volcanic islands of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (the red marker on the map)\n\nA blunder meant that the 50p coin supposed to show off one of the species of penguins that calls the Falkland Islands home, instead displayed a penguin that mainly lived 4,000 kilometres away.\n\nYou can tell the difference by looking at the length of the two subspecies' crest feathers.\n\nThe Northern Rockhopper has far longer feathers, while the variety native to the Falklands has far shorter feathers.\n\nThe latter are also a bit smaller.\n\nAs well as the Rockhopper 50p, other penguins to be displayed on a coin in 2017 by the Pobjoy Mint - a private company in Surrey - include the King Penguin, the Magellanic Penguin and the Gentoo Penguin\n\nNearly half of the batch had been minted by the time the mistake was discovered and production halted, meaning that 3,200 of these coins were made.\n\nThe correct coin was issued following the error, and even that still sells for nearly \u00a330.\n\nThe other coins; like ones featuring the Magellanic Penguin and Gentoo Penguin, sell on eBay for around their retail price of \u00a313, suggesting that scarcity isn't always everything.\n\nAll four of the 2017 50p coins released were minted just 7,500 times. This makes them really rare, but because they are uncirculated they will likely sell for less as they can be bought\n\nA mintage of 7,500 is still incredibly rare, error or not.\n\nFor comparison's sake the Kew Gardens 50p, considered the most valuable UK circulated coin, was minted 210,000 times.\n\nAnd that means that if you find yourself with one of the rare Northern Rockhopper error coins, you could make some money.\n\nLooking at Amazon, a number of the 50p coins are being listed for \u00a390 or more, with some listed for as much as \u00a3122. Though, of course, this doesn't suggest anyone is willing to pay that much for them.\n\nHowever there is evidence on eBay that collectors are willing to cough up the cash.\n\nA number of them have sold for upwards of \u00a387, including several examples of coins selling in the \u00a390 range, and one even sold for \u00a3113.95.\n\nThe Rockhopper error coin was minted 3,200 times, making it incredibly rare. No wonder it sells for upwards of \u00a385 online\n\nWhile the vast majority of those sold on eBay sell for amounts in the \u00a390 range, there have been examples of the 50p selling for more than \u00a3100 on eBay\n\nThat sale would've meant that if the seller had purchased it from the Pobjoy Mint, a private manufacturer based in Surrey, for its list price of around \u00a313 back when it was unknown that it had been made in error, they would have made slightly more than \u00a3100.\n\nThat's a cool profit right there.\n\nSo cool that it'd probably suit a penguin, whatever species of Rockhopper it might be.", "description": "Some of a set of 50p coins managed to accidentally feature a type of penguin that the Falklands doesn't typically play host to and one has sold for almost \u00a3114 on eBay.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
