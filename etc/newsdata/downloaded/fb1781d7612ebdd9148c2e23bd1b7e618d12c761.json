U.S. gold futures <GCv1> were 0.3% higher at $1,487.90 per ounce.\n\n\"There are some uncertainties since there is a lot to go through on Brexit. For instance even if both EU and UK negotiators agree on terms it still has to go through the parliament,\" AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes said.\n\nHowever, a signed Brexit deal could push yields higher, which fundamentally are significant headwinds over the near term for gold, Innes added.\n\nMarkets are still awaiting the outcome of talks that dragged on late into Tuesday night to see whether Britain and the EU can draft an agreement on Brexit before a summit later this week. It also remained unclear if London could avoid postponing its scheduled departure on Oct. 31.\n\nOfficials involved in negotiations said that differences over the terms of the split had narrowed significantly.\n\nHowever, Michel Barnier, EU negotiator, made it clear at a meeting of the bloc's ministers in Luxembourg that if an agreement could not be reached on Tuesday, it would be too late to send anything for leaders to approve at the summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.\n\nGold also found some support from fresh U.S.-China strains over Hong Kong.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed four pieces of legislation taking a hard line on China, three related to the protests in Hong Kong.\n\nBeijing opposed the new measures and urged lawmakers to stop interfering.\n\nSo far the trade negotiations were going well between U.S. and China, but if we see a flip over this issue we might see gold moving up, Phillip Futures analyst Benjamin Lu said.\n\n\"Gold is still relatively range bound between $1,474 and $1,510.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Asian shares inched higher with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> up 0.4%, while the dollar was slightly under pressure against a basket of six major currencies.\n\nAmong other precious metals, palladium <XPD=> rose 0.2% to $1,736.56 an ounce, hovering near its record high of $1,739.93 hit on Tuesday.\n\nSilver <XAG=> rose 0.4% higher to $17.44 per ounce and platinum <XPT=> was down 0.3% at $886.15.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Eileen Soreng and Karthika Suresh Namboothiri in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Shounak Dasgupta)", "description": "Spot gold  was up 0.2% at $1,484.10 per ounce as of 0427 GMT.
