What is really important is that we look at the things people say, we analyse them, we describe them objectively. If someone\u2019s told a lie, we call it out for being a lie. If someone\u2019s made a racist remark, we make sure people are aware that they\u2019re inherently racist.\n\n\u201cThe issue is about when she went on further to discuss President Trump himself, what his motivations were for that, and that breached our impartiality requirements. Our audiences should not be able to tell from BBC output the personal opinions of our journalists or current affairs presenters on matters of public policy, political, or industrial controversy.\u201d\n\nMunchetty made the original comments while presenting BBC Breakfast in July with co-host Dan Walker, who had questioned her on how she felt about Trump\u2019s intervention. Although Munchetty said she felt \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d, she did not directly call Trump a racist, instead saying the president\u2019s language was \u201cskirting the line\u201d.\n\nAlthough the BBC received many complaints from members of the public over the incident, only one individual chose to dispute the initial response and elevate the case to the executive complaints unit \u2013 the top-level internal arbiter of BBC standards.\n\nJordan, defending the BBC\u2019s position, accepted \u201cshe was led down the path by her co-presenter\u201d but Walker was not investigated because the member of the public complained only about Munchetty.\n\nThis has led to anger among fellow BBC journalists and reporters as to how a single member of the public with the time and inclination to pursue a complaint to higher levels has led to a public and internal crisis about how the corporation handles issues of race.\n\nThe BBC declined to comment on the make-up of the editorial complaints unit, although the Guardian understands it consists of seven individuals with only two women and no one from an ethnic minority background. Several members are former BBC current affairs programme editors approaching retirement.\n\nBBC staff have been reminded not to tweet their support for Munchetty or they could themselves face sanctions \u2013 although some journalists said these warnings had been delivered by managers who privately admitted they believed the editorial complaint unit\u2019s decision was wrong.", "description": "BBC Breakfast Show presenter made comments after Trump told four congresswomen to \u2018go home\u2019", "authors": ["Jim Waterson", "Afua Hirsch", "Lenny Henry", "Adrian Lester", "Krishnan Guru-Murthy", "Micha Frazer-Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbf165bbe3756cf51e3d2047891531e247734cab/17_80_2983_1789/master/2983.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a870c0676a803fe8e886074c3ab7f8b", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
