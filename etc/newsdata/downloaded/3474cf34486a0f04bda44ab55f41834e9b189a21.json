Sign up here.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve policy maker Narayana Kocherlakota says that while the recent disruptions in U.S. money markets won\u2019t undermine the central bank\u2019s ability to achieve its goals, they underscore that something is wrong with the plumbing of the financial system.\n\nIn an opinion piece for Bloomberg published Wednesday, the former Minneapolis Fed president said the \u201cdeeper issue\u201d is that since the financial crisis, regulatory reforms \u201chave constrained the ability of flush banks to lend, and of tight banks to borrow.\u201d While the central bank can temporarily inject cash into the markets to control short-term rates, Kocherlakota said it\u2019s hard to understand how funding markets will respond to future shocks.\n\nThe Fed has been injecting liquidity into the system since Sept. 17, when the rate on overnight general collateral repurchase agreements jumped to 10%, about four times greater than usual levels, as cash reserves were out of balance with the volume of securities on dealer balance sheets. The New York Fed conducted another overnight repo operation on Wednesday morning, taking the maximum amount of $75 billion, with dealers submitting about $92 billion of assets.\n\nThough overnight rates have retreated from record levels, general collateral repo has climbed back above 2% and was trading around 2.09% Wednesday, ICAP data show.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alexandra Harris in New York at aharris48@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Mark Tannenbaum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
