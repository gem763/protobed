U.S. officials, including Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, condemned the decision to invade northern Syria as \"impulsive\", saying it further puts America's Kurdish forces \"in harm's way.\"\n\nThis comes just days after Mr. Trump pulled American troops from northern Syria at the request of Turkish President Erdogan. Mr. Trump, who has been accused of abandoning the U.S. Kurdish allies, has since defended his move, saying the forces have \"wanted to fight, and that's the way it is.\"\n\nIn a significant rebuke to Mr. Trump, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland launched a bipartisan effort to punish Turkey for its attacks on the Kurds, America's top partner in the fight against ISIS. Graham, an ally of Mr. Trump's, lambasted the president's new Syria policy as sending the \"most dangerous signal possible\" on the world stage that America is an \"unreliable ally.\"\n\nState official speaks out amid impeachment probe\n\nIn a closed-door deposition Friday with three House panels leading the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, former ambassador to Ukraine Marie \"Masha\" Yovanovitch testified that Mr. Trump urged her removal even though the State Department believed she had \"done nothing wrong.\"\n\nYovanovitch \u2014 who Mr. Trump called \"bad news\" in a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 was abruptly removed from her post in May after Mr. Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani suggested she was undermining the president.\n\nTwo business associates of Giuliani who assisted him in the campaign to remove Yovanovitch and pressure Ukraine, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested Wednesday evening.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Parnas and Fruman made illegal campaign donations to a congressman, dubbed \"Congressman-1\", who was enlisted in the campaign to oust Yovanovitch. Campaign finance filings identify the lawmaker as former Republican Congressman Pete Sessions of Texas.\n\nDespite orders from the White House and State Department not to cooperate with Democrats' requests, another ambassador \u2014U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland \u2014 announced Friday that he will testify next week. Sondland was subpoenaed after skipping a voluntary interview earlier in the week.\n\n\"Face the Nation\" Guest Lineup:\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper (@EsperDoD)\n\n(@EsperDoD) Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep.
