I don't need to show my commitment.\n\n'My commitment is there after five years and a half [at the club]. I need to accept all criticism.\n\nMauricio Pochettino shrugged off talk of him quitting Tottenham on Saturday\n\nThey suffered a second humbling this week as they lost against Brighton on Saturday\n\n'It's not going to change my ambition. We can bounce back. I feel sorry for our fans.'\n\nAsked if he was concerned for his job, Pochettino said: 'No, I'm not worried. What worries me is life, not football.'\n\nSpurs suffered an early blow in the game as Hugo Lloris injured himself en route to Brighton's opener and he may now be out until the turn of the year.\n\nHe landed awkwardly as he fell into his goal. Television replays showed his arm bending backwards at the point of the elbow, leaving the French World Cup winner in agony.\n\nHe was rushed to hospital where tests revealed he had suffered a dislocated elbow. According to a source the Spurs skipper is expected to be out for two months, though it could be longer. BT Sport, who were broadcasting the lunchtime game live, decided against reshowing certain clips of the incident because it looked so gruesome.\n\nThe Argentine manager also insisted that he did not fear for his job after the defeat\n\nLloris received oxygen and was carried off on a stretcher. As he was taken down the tunnel, a doctor could be seen holding his arm upwards and the 32-year-old had his eyes closed. He was taken to hospital for further treatment and tests, where the news was described as 'not good'.\n\nSpurs manager Pochettino said the injury affected his players, who went on to lose 3-0. 'Everyone saw on the pitch how he landed,' Pochettino said. 'It's not a good situation. We cannot lie. It was an emotional game. The team was very affected. We didn't show our real performance.\n\n'I want to give credit to Brighton but the team has suffered a massive action.'\n\nA Tottenham statement on Lloris said: 'Assessment will continue this coming week to ascertain the full extent of the injury and the length of time he will require to undergo rehabilitation.'", "description": "KIERAN GILL AT THE AMEX: Mauricio Pochettino shrugged off talk of him quitting Spurs  despite a second humbling in five days leaving him feeling like he had been 'punched'.", "authors": ["Kieran Gill For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/20/19341022-0-image-a-8_1570304444704.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
