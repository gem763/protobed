The two even exchanged gestures cageside before that.\n\n\u201cYou know who\u2019s next,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cI have a heavy Ricky Martin wannabe next. \u2018Borrachinha.\u2019 This is my octagon. I\u2019m going to smash him. I want to rearrange his face.\u201d\n\nCosta (13-0 MMA, 5-0 UFC) wasn\u2019t able to respond to the taunting Adesanya in the cage, but he appeared on ESPN+\u2019s postfight show and left no doubt how he believes the fight, should it be made, would go.\n\n\u201cHe pointed at me, you know,\u201d Costa said. \u201cAnd I know he cannot handle it from me. He cannot handle it from me when I close the distance, and I can kill him.\u201d\n\nCosta, in fact, made several such morbid references over the course of his interview.\n\n\u201cI think I am the most dangerous guy in my division, the middleweight division,\u201d Costa said. \u201cAnd when I put my hands on his head, his body, he\u2019s going to feel a lot. I feel he can die, for sure.\u201d\n\nAsked his opinion of Saturday night\u2019s fight, Costa said Whittaker got off to a good start before things turned.\n\nBut Costa also referenced Adesanya\u2019s razor-thin win over Kelvin Gastelum to take the interim crown at UFC 236. Costa believes that Gastelum laid out the blueprint to beat the undefeated \u201cLast Style Bender,\u201d and that if Gastelum, who has fluctuated between welterweight and middleweight in his career, had more power, he would have finished the fight.\n\n\u201cI think Robert Whittaker start the fight very well, close the distance, because everyone knows when you close the distance against Israel Adesanya, he (loses) his distance, his time,\u201d Costa said. \u201cHe cannot fight with guys who pressure him. Everyone see, to watch the fight against Gastelum, and if Gastelum had my power, I think Gastelum could have knocked him out.\u201d\n\nThat belief helps fuel Costa\u2019s insistence that he\u2019s the guy to hand Adesanya his first professional MMA defeat.\n\n\u201cNow, we have only one fight to do,\u201d Costa said. \u201cOne fight to make up. It\u2019s me against Israel. I want this fight with all my soul. I will take his head off of this cage. Man, you don\u2019t know how much I want this fight.\u201d", "description": "A pair of undefeated middleweights have erupted in a war of words heading into what should be a big UFC title fight.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Blue Corner", "Ken Hathaway", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/paulo-costa-ufc-243-guest-fighter-qa.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
