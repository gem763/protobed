What are you doing on the land?\"' Mr Joyce told Sky News.\n\n'We've got to support you in the drought but if your place is just not viable, $36,000 just isn't going to make a difference and people have to answer their own question in their own mind if this the job in their life for them.\n\n'We don't want to keep people in perpetual poverty.'\n\nMr Joyce said more than 11,000 farmers had been given the allowance but it was never going to be permanent.\n\nMr Joyce said more than 11,000 farmers had been given the allowance but it was never going to be permanent\n\nBut Mr Joyce quickly found himself in hot water with Labour agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon saying he has 'deserted' farmers in their time of need.\n\n'Farmers everywhere today will be just shaking their heads and feeling bewildered over Barnaby Joyce's remarks,' Mr Fitzgibbon told The Australian.\n\n'This is a guy who once claimed to be their champion but he has deserted them in their hour of need.'\n\nMr Fitzgibbon said farmers would be shocked to learn the allowance has been taken away from them as they enter into one of the worst droughts Australia has seen.\n\n'Withdrawing the modest Farm Household Allowance from drought-devastated farmers must surely be the greatest act of bastardry by a government in the history of the Australian Federation,' he said.\n\nSenator Pauline Hanson also slammed Mr Joyce over the controversial comments.\n\nMr Joyce quickly found himself in hot water with Labour agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon saying he has 'deserted' farmers in their time of need\n\n'I know Barnaby, and I speak to him, but sometimes when it comes to politics I'm sorry, he's as useless as t**s on a bull,' Ms Hanson told 2GB radio.\n\nShe said many people lived on the dole for decades and said it was 'ridiculous' that farmers were cut off after just four.\n\n'He was the Deputy Prime Minister of this country. What has been done? Absolutely nothing has been done about it.'\n\n'We have people on the dole for years in and years out for 20, 30 years, now we can't support the man on the land for more than four years? I think that's ridiculous.'\n\nThe Morrison government set aside a staggering $7billion for those affected by the drought.\n\nThe government also announced a $100million package to help extend and simplify the allowance.\n\nFarmers are now eligible to receive the payment four years of every decade rather than just over one period of time.", "description": "The politician's comments come in the wake of 200 Queensland farmers being stripped of their farm household allowances which saw them receiving $36,000 every year.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/13/19586150-0-image-a-8_1570797397808.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
