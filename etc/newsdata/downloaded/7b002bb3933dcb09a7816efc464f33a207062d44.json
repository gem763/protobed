A blood-splattered portrait of the American meatpacking industry, it documented the misery and filth of the city\u2019s slaughterhouses, where miserable workers churned out cuts of rotten meat in treacherous, rat-infested conditions. \u201cThe air would be full of steam, from the hot water and the hot blood, so that you could not see five feet before you,\u201d Sinclair wrote. \u201cAnd then, with men rushing about at the speed they kept up on the killing-beds, and all with butcher-knives, like razors, in their hands well, it was to be counted as a wonder that there were not more men slaughtered than cattle\u2026\u201d\n\nWe have The Jungle to thank for certain food-safety regulations today. Protections for meat-industry workers, though, would come later\u2014and President Trump has been trying to undo even that modest progress. His administration last year authorized faster \u201cline speeds\u201d (the number of animals killed per minute) for poultry plants, and began looking into doing the same for beef. New U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations that take effect in December will allow the same at pork plants, while also cutting 40 percent of government inspectors and delegating inspections to employees, who may not have undergone any kind of training in food safety.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and an advocacy group, Public Citizen, last week sued the administration over the new rules, saying that faster line speeds will increase worker injuries. That\u2019s a certainty. As The Guardian noted in 2018, \u201cUS meatpacking workers are already three times more likely to suffer serious injury than the average American worker,\u201d with pork and beef workers almost seven times more likely to sustain repetitive strain injuries from slicing and hauling. Bureau of Labor Statistics show the injury rate for meatpacking workers is 2.4 times higher than the national average for all industries. Trump is taking an already dangerous, dehumanizing job, and making it even more so.\n\nBut these changes also pose a risk to millions of Americans who will never set foot in a slaughterhouse, as the lack of proper oversight in identifying sick animals or hygiene issues increases the risk of foodborne illnesses for meat eaters. \u201cWith less government oversight over hog slaughter inspection, big meat companies will have the freedom to inspect themselves and push towards their goal of increasing line speeds,\u201d the nonprofit Food & Water Watch told Newsweek. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it: faster line speeds + less inspection = more food contamination.\u201d", "description": "More than a century after Upton Sinclair's gruesome \"The Jungle,\" the president is loosening rules that protect workers and consumers alike.", "authors": ["Kim Kelly"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/96f32cb55b96ea122605496f162933bdb2a6be03.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
