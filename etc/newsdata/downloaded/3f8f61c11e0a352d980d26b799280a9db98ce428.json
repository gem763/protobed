Signs likened the president and the GOP to rodents, and people donned masks, petted stuffed vermin, or wore them on their heads.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTrump is the real rat!\u201d the crowd chanted.\n\nEvening commuters leaned on their horns in support.\n\nOne woman held a sign saying she loved her congressman, referring to Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), whose efforts to investigate the Trump White House as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee first drew the president\u2019s ire.\n\nListen on Post Reports: Reporter Erin Cox on why President Trump\u2019s attacks on Baltimore so deeply affected a city still trying to heal.\n\nHouse Republicans selected Baltimore as the location for their three-day conference long before the president\u2019s attack on the city, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 10 to 1. Well before the White House announced that Trump would attend the conference, a coalition of advocacy groups calling themselves the Baltimore Welcoming Committee had planned days of rallies to protest GOP policies on immigration, climate change and other topics. There was to be a singalong, a light show and a dance party. Organizer Sharon Black said Trump\u2019s scheduled appearance \u201cupped the ante.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is about the remarks about Baltimore and his policies. You can\u2019t really separate the two,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen the motorcade passed by at 6:40 p.m., onlookers on both sides of the street raised their middle fingers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTrump is the real rat,\u201d they chanted.\n\nThere were counterprotesters, too. About half a dozen \u201cBikers for Trump\u201d came to the waterfront area, saying they wanted to show support for the president.\n\n\u201cI grew up in Baltimore,\u201d said retired construction worker Steven Imchula, 70, of Bel Air, Md. \u201cEverything Trump said about Baltimore is true.\u201d\n\nFound a half-dozen Bikers for Trump folks here to support the president. Says one: \u201cI\u2019m not here to start trouble. But if I see some moron burning a flag, his a\u2014 is mine.\u201d pic.twitter.com/jk5b1j8AZx \u2014 Erin Cox (@ErinatThePost) September 12, 2019\n\nJoe Murphy, a 50-year-old insurance salesman, arrived alone and unfurled a large Trump 2020 banner, prompting an onslaught of taunts from protesters. Brenton Williamson, 29, ran over to help hold the banner as police escorted them across President Street, somewhat away from the crowd.\n\n\u201cLook at those people,\u201d Murphy, of Baltimore, said moments later, standing next to a 15-foot-tall rat king effigy of Trump. \u201cThey\u2019re dressed like rats and Homer Simpson. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re even allowed to vote.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was the first of several times officers had to intervene as Murphy tangled with critics of the president. At one point, an officer physically separated Murphy from Duane G. \u201cShorty\u201d Davis, who had a rat puppet on his left hand and a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Trump head on his right.\n\nPolice also tried to remove four women whose signs said, \u201cNo GOP racists on our streets,\u201d from a park bench on the sidewalk. \u201cWhy do we have to go?\u201d one said to an officer.\n\nAsked Wednesday about Trump\u2019s visit, Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. \u201cJack\u201d Young (D) said, \u201cWe\u2019re a welcoming city, and he\u2019s welcome to be here.\u201d\n\nYoung said that if Trump traveled beyond the Inner Harbor, he would notice \u201cthat every neighborhood is not crime-ridden and dirty.\u201d City Council President Brandon Scott (D) said he hoped the visit would allow Trump to see some of the infrastructure challenges the city faces.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s been touting bringing infrastructure to Americans who live across the country . . . those jobs that could be created through that would change the very neighborhoods that he was disparaging,\u201d Scott said.\n\nBruce Knauff of Towson, Md., said he came to the protest because \u201cof a general dislike of Trump, the lies, the hate, the everything.\u201d He said rather than criticizing Baltimore, the president should do something to help the city.\n\nChris Tallent, 38, of Baltimore, chanted, \u201cNo racists on our streets\u201d and said he is on a mission \u201cto get rid of the GOP.\u201d\n\nNearby, a bare-chested 28-year-old defense industry worker named Steve slid a Vladimir Putin mask off his face and, for a minute, dropped his faux Russian accent.\n\nAD\n\nHe had a bridled Trump doll between his legs and a riding crop resting on his shoulder.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s not about changing minds,\u201d he said, declining to give his last name. \u201cSometimes, these protests are about trying to have fun with people who agree with you.\u201d\n\nThis article includes material from the Associated Press.\n\n\u2018Louder and more hateful\u2019: Big-city leaders say Trump\u2019s attacks on Baltimore are escalation of his strategy to denigrate diverse, liberal areas\n\nBen Carson comes to Baltimore to defend Trump\u2019s depiction\n\n\u2018Better to have a few rats than be one\u2019: Trump attacked Baltimore, and the city\u2019s newspaper wrote a scathing response.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The president came to Baltimore to speak to GOP lawmakers after attacking the city on Twitter.", "authors": ["Erin Cox", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics", "Ovetta Wiggins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dAH1cyXzPu2zIuOQmzwj9cYqBQ4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BS347HWVTYI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg"}
