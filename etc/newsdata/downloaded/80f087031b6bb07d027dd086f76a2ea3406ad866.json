First, residents should not release the fish. Secondly, \"Kill it immediately (remember, it can survive on land) and freeze it.\"\n\nFishermen who find a northern snakehead should take pictures, note where it was caught and then report it, the Georgia DNR said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur first line of defense in the fight against aquatic invasive species, such as the northern snakehead, are our anglers,\u201d Matt Thomas, chief of fisheries for the Wildlife Resources Division, said in a statement.\n\n'This is not the wild west': Florida commission clarifies stance on killing green iguanas\n\n\u201cThanks to the quick report by an angler, our staff was able to investigate and confirm the presence of this species in this water body. We are now taking steps to determine if they have spread from this water body and, hopefully, keep it from spreading to other Georgia waters,\" Thomas said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the northern snakehead is native to Eastern Asia and \"preys on and competes with native species.\"\n\nThe northern snakehead can grow to \"three feet in length,\" according to the Georgia DNR.\n\n\"They have a long dorsal fin that runs along their whole back, and have a dark brown blotchy appearance. They can breathe air, and can survive in low oxygenated systems,\" the department added.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Invasive fish that can breathe air, survive on land found in Georgia", "description": "The Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Wildlife Resources Division confirmed someone found an invasive northern snakehead in a pond.", "authors": ["Jordan Culver", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
