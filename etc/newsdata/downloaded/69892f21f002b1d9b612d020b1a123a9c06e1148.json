The DA is blessed to have as part of its professional staff component such a dynamic, diverse and talented group of people \u2013 bound together by a deep and abiding commitment to the party and to building a non-racial, inclusive and prosperous South Africa for all who live in it, no matter the circumstances of their birth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am particularly grateful for the support and wisdom that the senior management team of the operation have offered me over the years; they have often made the seemingly impossible possible. I have always tried my best to match their support by leading in a principled manner and with the seriousness that the responsibilities this role demanded of me,\u201d said Boughey.\n\nHe leaves the DA during a time when internal infighting is at its peak leading up to this weekend\u2019s federal council, which will elect James Selfe\u2019s successor as federal chairperson.\n\n\u201cI am especially grateful of having had the chance to work directly with James Selfe and Mmusi Maimane. James is truly one of the unsung heroes of South Africa\u2019s democratic dispensation. His wisdom, counsel and support has been invaluable, and the 40 years of service and counting he has offered this party and its predecessors is unlikely to ever be matched in our lifetime.\u201d\n\nHe also praised Maimane saying: \u201cWorking with Mmusi has been an extraordinary experience. Together we have travelled across South Africa and the world, and I have always been struck by his unwavering commitment and belief in building one South Africa for all. I have seen firsthand the warmth and affection South Africans from across all walks of life have for him. He too has taught me much; humility, patience and an unwavering belief that ultimately the better angels of people\u2019s nature will prevail, something which I am sure has been severely tested in recent times.\u201d\n\nHe said he had had the unique privilege of working directly with many senior political leaders of the DA across the country.\n\n\u201cI have learnt a great deal from them all. We have experienced great highs, most notably the historic successes in the 2016 elections, and working together to form the new governments that arose from these elections. We have weathered numerous storms, and together have had to come to terms with the disappointing election results of 2019,\u201d said Boughey.", "description": "Democratic Alliance chief executive Paul Boughey has handed in his resignation following an internal review panel\u2019s recommendation that he and DA leader Mmusi Maimane step aside.", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9488/38cac943f8504310821dfc93fc951a00.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
