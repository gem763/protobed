The detonation is planned for Saturday close to midday, according to authorities.\n\nThe collapse killed three workers and left more than 20 others injured last Saturday. A video released by WWL-TV shows bystanders fleeing the scene as one side of the building topples to the ground, covering the street in debris and dust.\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the formation of Tropical Storm Nestor influenced officials' decision to move forward with a controlled demolition, owing to the gusty winds it will bring to the area.\n\n\"There is a probability that we're going to have elevated winds regardless, and winds that pose a particular danger with respect to the cranes that remain in place over here at the site of the Hard Rock Hotel,\" Edwards told reporters. \"We have concerns about how the weather may impact the operation here and the stability of the two cranes.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gerald Herbert/AP Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nTropical Storm Nestor is not expected to pass over New Orleans, but the city's mayor, LaToya Cantrell, issued a declaration of emergency because of the storm's winds and the hotel's collapse.\n\nFire Chief Tim McConnell described the city's plan to destroy the cranes, which will involve the use of \"small explosives that will damage in a very methodical way that will bring the cranes down in an exact location.\" If all goes as planned, the explosion will look like it's \"melting,\" according to McConnell.\n\nThe cranes, one standing about 270 feet tall and the other about 300 feet, are not stable. McConnell said the towers moved several inches overnight.\n\nThe city spent the days following the collapse evaluating the stability of the cranes and searching for an individual who remained missing in the wreckage. On Wednesday evening, the city decided to switch from rescue mode to recovery mode, after evidence indicated the missing person had not survived.\n\nA temporary evacuation zone surrounds the area around the hotel, displacing residents and businesses. The city's Health Department is making resources, including mental health counseling, available to those impacted by the collapse.\n\nIn anticipation of the explosion, the city is removing vehicles from the area and shutting off gas service to mitigate hazards.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration will investigate the cause of the collapse, which remains unknown. Citadel Builders LLC, the contractor hired to build the hotel, said it will cooperate and aid in any investigations.\n\nTwo law firms are filing a lawsuit against developers on behalf of 10 people injured, seeking unspecified damages.\n\nPaolo Zialcita is an intern on NPR's News Desk.", "description": "A tropical storm will bring gusty winds to the area, threatening the stability of two towering cranes that remain unstable following last weekend's disaster.", "authors": ["Paolo Zialcita"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/18/ap_19290749754360_wide-02538ecc395173b61f281174f9b04fff850b09bc.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
