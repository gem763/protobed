It\u2019s time to put GOP senators on the spot with impeachment.", "language": "en", "text": "But now, it\u2019s pencils down for the GOP. The easy-to-dodge days for Senate Republicans are coming to an end. Voters deserve stark clarity in the wake of Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, and there is one certain way to get it. The Democratic House must impeach the president and force the question on the Senate: yea or nay on Donald Trump?\n\nThe startling revelations surrounding the president\u2019s July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have forced this unforgiving moment in our history. If Trump indeed pressured the Ukrainian government to assist his reelection campaign by interfering with our elections \u2014 and the facts, so far, suggest that he did exactly that \u2014 the president has violated his oath of office and committed a vividly impeachable offense. If he is innocent of all charges, the president could instantly exonerate himself by releasing the tape and transcript of his now-infamous phone call; instead, he has begun his usual pattern of divert, obfuscate and deny, raising anew old questions about his contempt for the rule of law.\n\nThe president\u2019s actions are highly likely to buffalo House Democrats into voting on impeachment. The argument heard earlier this year about impeachment being a political gift to the GOP no longer holds. The new sins are too big and too obvious. Our entire national political debate is now centered squarely upon Trump and his fitness for office. It is a time for clarity, no matter what the cost.\n\nA House impeachment vote would, in short order, put every GOP senator and representative on the spot. Republican senators in particular would no longer have the shelter of silence, as they would make the final determination on guilt. It\u2019s comparatively easy for the House Democrats to punish Trump with charges; the vital question is whether Senate Republicans would be brave enough to clean their own house, or brave enough to defend the president\u2019s actions without equivocation. Then let the voters judge.\n\nArticles of impeachment from the House would create extremely tough political calculations for Republican officeholders and candidates to grind through. Endangered Republican senators such as Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine and Martha McSally of Arizona would weigh two painful election-year options: one in which they struggle in their purple states to explain their vote to defend the president for doing the indefensible; or another where Vice President Pence leads the ticket but \u2014 despite the funereal wails of the president\u2019s most fervent cultists \u2014 they can at least pivot to talking about the future and the dangers of the Democratic nominee. Other GOP senators, now retiring, would have to consider their legacies as they cast the most important vote of their long careers. Still others, who found the courage to criticize the president in the past, may find their voices once more.\n\nFinancial wizards have a wonderful term for the cold, bloodless business of discovering a given asset\u2019s true value at a given moment; they call it \u201cmarking to market.\u201d It\u2019s a hardheaded calculation, for it reduces all things, regardless of sentimentality or nuance, to a clear valuation. In the wake of the president\u2019s actions on Ukraine, the Republican Party and the officials who lead it must be brutally marked to market on the issue of Trump\u2019s fitness for office.\n\nThis test would create an existential question for every Republican senator and representative: Why am I here? To serve my future or my country?\n\nMy Democratic friends assume the worst, seeing most elected Republicans as little more than a corrupt cartel of Trump bitter-enders. I think they underestimate the character of many of the men and women I know well who serve the Republican Party. But now is the time the country must find out. Force the question with impeachment.\n\nRead more:\n\nE.J. Dionne Jr.: Why Trump gets away with everything\n\nGeorge T. Conway III and Neal Katyal: Trump has done plenty to warrant impeachment.
