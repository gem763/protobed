Morgan Chase.\n\nThe federal deficit is projected to hit a staggering $1 trillion next year \u2014 and may even grow if the current slowdown becomes a full-fledged downturn.\n\nUsing past recessions in 1990 and 2001 as reference, JP Morgan estimated that a mild recession that nudges up the unemployment rate by roughly 2 percentage points would grow the deficit by 3.6% of gross domestic product.\n\nThe deteriorating fiscal outlook comes as fears of a recession stir speculation that a fresh round of fiscal stimulus could arrive ahead of the 2020 election. Last week, reports circulated that the president was weighing a payroll tax cut for workers.\n\n\u201cAlthough it would not be entirely free of risk, there would be compelling arguments for the federal government to borrow money to provide stimulus, especially in a world of low interest rates and inflation that would likely coincide with a recession,\u201d J.P. Morgan analyst Jesse Edgerton wrote in a research note this week.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration\u2019s biggest challenges are political, the bank said, as partisan divisions in Congress and the upcoming general election could make legislation difficult.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gestures while speaking at the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting Friday, Aug. 23, 2019, in San Francisco.

Morgan, Trump is likely to face some resistance from within his own Republican Party \u2014 but the biggest obstacle would be Democrats, who don\u2019t want to hand Trump a victory that may help his reelection chances.\n\n\u201cPerhaps most crucial is the question of whether Democratic legislators would support a stimulus bill that could be seen as benefiting President Trump,\u201d Edgerton said.\n\nTrump could try to stimulate the U.S. economy via executive action, the economist argued. However, bypassing Congress in order to achieve the effect of a tax cut would not have a meaningful impact on the U.S. economy, according to Edgerton\u2019s analysis.\n\n\u201cBecause a $20 billion annual tax cut amounts to less than 0.1% of US GDP, we would expect only de minimis effects,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat leaves legislation hammered out with Democrats as the most effective way to boost the economy, according to the economist.\n\nAlthough partisan tensions are high, with Democrats trying to retake the White House, Edgerton said there was a possibility of bipartisan legislation. He cited the precedent of President George W. Bush working with a Democratic Congress to pass a stimulus bill in 2008.\n\n\u201cWhile such bipartisan cooperation may seem quaintly charming today, it nonetheless failed to prevent the 2008 recession,\u201d he added.\n\nMore from Sibile:\n\nFor the first time since Trump elected, more voters say economy is worsening\n\nWhy more than half of millennials get denied credit\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s immunity to big market losses spells trouble for Wall Street\n\nThese people are most likely to lose their jobs first in a recession\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo Finance's All Markets Summit, Oct. 10 More\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The largest federal deficit ever outside of a recession may not block a new stimulus package, but is fraught with political risks, according to J.P.
