But Democrats have pointed to demographic trends as well as the fact that Republican Sen. Ted Cruz won reelection by just over 2 points last year as evidence that the second-most-populous state could soon be in play.\n\nTrump's campaign and the RNC have been raking in money, raising a record $125 million in the third quarter of this year.\n\nBy comparison, former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011 for his reelection campaign.\n\nTrump speaks during a ribbon cutting ceremony at the Louis Vuitton workshop\n\nDuring his speech, he heaped praise on his daughter and son-in-law and made them stand so the crowd could applaud them.
