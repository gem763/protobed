[But] we need to think of our own priorities, and I've been very clear about it.\"\n\nThe nearly hour-long interview \u2014 in one of Saddam Hussein's old palaces, mostly unchanged since the days when he ruled Iraq \u2014 showed clearly how Salih feels as a leader who has relied on the U.S. as an ally for decades.\n\nAmong his biggest concerns: the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, leaving the Kurds to fend for themselves and increasing the danger of a resurgence of ISIS.\n\nKeep in mind: Salih is one of the most influential Kurdish figures in the world \u2014 he's the former leader of Iraqi Kurdistan. And he chooses his words carefully. So the threat of ethnic cleansing by Turkish troops in Syria is hitting him especially hard.\n\n\"I'm worried about ethnic cleansing. And this has been the history, tragic history of the Kurdish people and this [is] dangerous and tragic. The humanitarian cost is just awful.\"\n\nSalih also said he was \"worried\" about war breaking out between the U.S. and Iran \u2014 and Iraq can't afford to pick sides in such a war.\n\nBetween the lines: Salih seemed most concerned about Trump's general desire to disengage from the Middle East and bring U.S. troops home.\n\n\"We live in an interconnected world,\" Salih said. \"What happened in Iraq impacted your security and vice versa. Your policies impact the Middle East, too.\"\n\nWhat's next? One of the biggest consequences of the Syria withdrawal, he said, could be the re-emergence of ISIS \u2014 \"a revival of these extremist groups\" that would be \"basically fueling another cycle of this conflict.\"\n\n\"We have had serious conversations about this with senior American officials. And I've been very clear. I don't mince my words,\" Salih said. \"The military defeat of ISIS is an important victory, but not incomplete [sic] and precarious too as well. It can easily unravel. And this is what I'm worried about.\"\n\n\"Five years of blood, treasure, effort \u2014 a lot of human misery went into defeating ISIS,\" he said. \"This victory was [not] easy, and for anyone to become complacent about it is terrible, reckless, dangerous, tragic.\"\n\nOn war between the U.S. and Iran\n\nSalih says he's \"worried\" about a war breaking out between the United States and Iran \u2014 and that this war would spell \"disaster for everybody.\"\n\nDriving the news: Salih is stuck between the U.S. and Iran, as he considers both countries to be Iraq's allies. When it was put to Salih that he might have to pick a side if war breaks out, Salih said Iraq couldn't afford to choose between the U.S. and Iran.\n\nThe reality, he said, is that it's not in Iraq's interests to harm its powerful neighbor. (The subtext: Iraq doesn't want a repeat of the devastating Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.)\n\n\"Iran is a neighbor of ours. We have 1,400 kilometers [870 miles] of borders with Iran. And we cannot wish Iran ill. It's not in our interests,\" Salih said.\n\n\"The United States is an important ally, partner. \u2026 We want this to continue and we definitely don't want our territory to be used,\" he said. \"We should try and stop it because Iraq cannot sustain it, cannot survive it.\"\n\nWhy it matters: If the U.S. goes to war with Iran, some analysts believe that Iraq would be the first battlefield. The U.S. has more than 5,000 troops stationed in Iraq. Iran, using the militias it controls inside Iraq, could attack the U.S. forces as these militias have done in the past.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
