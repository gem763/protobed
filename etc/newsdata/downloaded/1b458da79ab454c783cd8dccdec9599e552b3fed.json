Ban the Iranian federation until they allow all the Iranian women to go to the stadium. They should be just as equal as the men,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday, FIFA expressed its condolences and said it reiterated \u201cour calls on the Iranian authorities to ensure the freedom and safety of any women engaged in this legitimate fight to end the stadium ban for women in Iran.\u201d\n\n\u2018FOUL LANGUAGE\u2019\n\nJesper Moller, president of the Danish Football Union, and a member of FIFA\u2019s organising committee for competitions, told Danish newspaper Politiken that he expects action from the governing body.\n\n\u201cFIFA has an independent disciplinary system and they will look at it. I will let them. And once they have given a verdict, it may well be that the case ends up with the international sports court, CAS. But that it (the stadium ban) must be punished is clear,\u201d said Moller, who is also a member of European governing body UEFA\u2019s executive committee.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s chief of staff said on Wednesday that women would be allowed into stadiums if foul language in chants and sporadic violence was curbed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see a problem with women attending if the atmosphere in stadiums is convenient... but with so much foul language among fans and violence, this is not advisable,\u201d Mahmoud Vaezi told state television.\n\nHe said the sports minister would contact leaders of supporter groups to \u201cimprove the atmosphere from a moral standpoint\u201d and special areas for women would be set up in stadiums.\n\n\u201cIf there is a well-mannered atmosphere in stadiums, we have no objection to (the admission of women),\u201d Vaezi told reporters after a cabinet meeting.\n\nIran\u2019s national team won a World Cup qualifier in Hong Kong 2-0 on Tuesday.\n\nCaptain Masoud Shojaei issued a statement on Instagram, describing the match as \u201cthe most bitter and saddest win of the national team.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe scored two goals and won the game on the field. But we lost because Sahar is no longer,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cShame on me for not having been able to do anything and shame on those who took away the most obvious right from Sahar and all Sahars.\u201d\n\n\u2018EQUALITY IS A LIE\u2019\n\nFormer Australia captain and human rights activist Craig Foster told Reuters that FIFA needed to enforce its own rules.\n\n\u201cThe FIFA statutes say that discrimination on grounds of gender is punishable by suspension or expulsion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the statutes are not worth upholding, then withdraw them and let football be honest to the women of Iran. Because at the moment, despite the promise, equality is a lie,\u201d he added.\n\nThere were signs that the situation regarding female fans in Iran was changing when a group of women were permitted to attend the second leg of the Asian Champions League final in Tehran last November.\n\nInfantino was present at the Azadi Stadium when Persepolis played Japan\u2019s Kashima Antlers in front more than 1,000 female fans in a designated \u201cfamily section\u201d.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Fans of Iran's Esteghlal cheer as they hold their national flag during their AFC Champions League soccer match playoff against Saudi Arabia's Al Ittifaq, in Tehran February 18, 2012.

At Iran\u2019s friendly against Syria in June, women were locked out of the Azadi Stadium and detained by security forces.", "description": "FIFA officials will visit Iran, following the death of a female fan who set herself on fire in protest at her arrest for attending a match, world soccer's governing body told Reuters on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428791321&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1NN", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
