She said that Drummond would go \"months or years\" without seeing his son, or without answering her calls and texts.\n\nIn that post, she also said that Drummond had multiple affairs with other colleagues at Google.\n\nDrummond responded to the allegations last Thursday in a statement, saying that he was \"far from perfect\" but that there were \"two sides\" to the story. The chief legal exec also said that other than Blakely, he had \"never started a relationship\" with anyone else at Google or Alphabet, and that \"any suggestion otherwise is simply untrue.\"\n\nRead more: The career rise and controversy of David Drummond, Alphabet's chief lawyer whose extramarital relationship with a former employee reignited criticism of Google's culture\n\nLater on Tuesday, CNBC reported that Drummond's new wife was Corinne Dixon \u2014 a Google employee who worked under the exec in the company's legal department years ago, but left for a stint of about three years, joining Pinterest.\n\nIn April 2018, according to her LinkedIn profile, Dixon returned to Google's legal department \u2014 though, as Drummond currently serves at Alphabet, Google's parent company, she is technically outside of Drummond's direct reporting chain. That's an important distinction because neither Google nor Alphabet allow relationships between managers and subordinates.\n\nDrummond maintains that the two only \"started\" dating after she left Google, Axios said. That detail might explain the specific phrasing of Drummond's statement last week, specifying he had \"never started a relationship\" with another colleague at Google other than Blakely.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nToday, Drummond is one of Alphabet's most senior and highest paid executives.\n\nHis role, however, seems to have moved out of the public eye more and more since the bombshell New York Times piece from last fall which shed more light into his relationship with Blakely and described the company as giving multimillion-dollar payouts to departing executives accused of sexual harassment. At this year's annual shareholder meeting, for instance Drummond was seated in the audience \u2014 rather than hosting it, as he had in years past.\n\nGot a tip?
