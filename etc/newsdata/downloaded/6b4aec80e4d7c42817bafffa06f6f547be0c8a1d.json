In the U.S., S&P 500 futures were down 0.6%.\n\nMarkets continued to react to disappointing economic data. Germany's leading economics research institutes jointly lowered their growth forecasts Wednesday for Europe's largest economy. They cited slowing global demand for capital goods, structural changes in the auto sector -- one of Germany's most important industries -- and political uncertainty. That followed Tuesday's figures showing manufacturing activity in the U.S. was at its lowest point in a decade in the U.S.\n\nSteel giant ArcelorMittal and Finnish construction machinery maker Konecranes were both among the biggest losers in Europe, falling 3.8% and 4% respectively.\n\n\"There hasn't been a single month this year where Germany has seen expansion in its manufacturing sector,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, who expects the weakness in manufacturing to spill over into the services sector.\n\nIf the manufacturing slowdown spreads to the still robust service sector, this would increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut rates again in October, said Stefan Schilbe, HSBC Germany's chief economist.\n\nAmong individual stocks, shares in U.K. bookmaking business Flutter Entertainment rose 17% after it agreed to merge with Stars Group, creating an online betting giant worth more than $11 billion.\n\nU.K. stocks overall were among the hardest hit in Europe. That was despite a weaker pound, which usually benefits FTSE 100 listed companies, many of which derive a majority of their earnings abroad. The pound fell 0.4% to $1.226.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson presented his latest Brexit proposal and warned he is still prepared to take the U.K. out of the EU at the end of October without a deal.\n\nThe FTSE 100's decline was driven by mining and oil companies as well as the construction sector, said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. U.K. construction activity data dropped in September, a slowdown which survey respondents attributed to uncertainty over Brexit. Miners Antafogasta PLC and Rio Tinto traded down 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively.\n\nEuropean luxury-goods stocks traded lower ahead of an expected World Trade Organization ruling on the extent of tariffs the U.S. would be allowed to impose on some European goods, including luxury items and airplanesLVMH traded 2.2% lower, Burberry and Kering each traded 3% lower.\n\nBank stocks in Europe fell, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index down 1.2%, reflecting unease about falling bond yields, which crimp lender profits. Banks' performance is also seen as highly correlated with economic growth. Swiss bank UBS Group was down 1.7%.\n\nIn Asia, Korea's Kospi was down nearly 2% following news that North Korea fired at least one missile off its east coast. The move, seen as a show of strength, came after Pyongyang said it would resume official nuclear talks with the U.S. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 0.5% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.2%. Mainland Chinese stock markets were closed for a holiday.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude fell 0.3% to $58.75 a barrel.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys was slightly lower at 1.625%, from 1.638% Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nLooking ahead, investors will eye the ADP National Employment Report for signs of any cracks in the U.S. job market. Plus, Ford Motor Co. will report third-quarter sales.\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 02, 2019 08:15 ET (12:15 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
