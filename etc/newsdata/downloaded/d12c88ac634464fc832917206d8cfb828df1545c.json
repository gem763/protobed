She said in a letter to a U.S. Senate committee last year that she \u201coperate[s] independently of any government bodies.\u201d\n\nBut the e-mails, which were provided to RFE/RL, show her communicating with Sergei Bochkaryov, a top official in the office of Prosecutor-General Yury Chaika, about an official government response to a U.S. legal request.\n\n\u201cDear Sergei Aleksandrovich! I am sending you the edits to the response, in accordance with instructions. I am ready to answer any questions that may arise at any time that is convenient for you. Respectfully, NV,\u201d one message, dated August 2, 2014, read.\n\nThey were first reported on by The New York Times.\n\nVeseltnitskaya could not immediately be reached for comment, but in remarks to the Interfax news agency, she said that her e-mail accounts had been hacked in February.\n\nThe documents were obtained by an organization called Dossier, which is funded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the Russian oil baron who was imprisoned for years and his oil company assets sold off. Now living outside of Russia, he is a vocal critic of the Kremlin and President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAt the time of the exchange with the prosecutors\u2019 office, Veseltnitskaya represented Prevezon, a company owned by a Russian businessman. U.S. authorities alleged that Prevezon had been the recipient of laundered funds from a massive tax fraud scheme that stole $250 million from the Russian treasury in the mid-2000s.\n\nPrevezon repeatedly denied being the recipient of any of the tax fraud proceeds, and in 2014, the U.S. Justice Department requested documentation related to the fraud from Chaika\u2019s office.\n\nIn May 2017, on the eve of the beginning of a civil asset forfeiture trial in Manhattan, the company and U.S. prosecutors settled the case. Prevezon agreed to pay $6 million and admitted no culpability in the scheme.\n\nThe original tax fraud was uncovered by a Russian whistle-blower named Sergei Magnitsky who was later detained on allegations of perpetrating the fraud. A Russian court convicted him of the fraud a few years after he died in a Moscow prison in November 2009 after alleged beatings and medical negligence.\n\nMagnitsky\u2019s death led to a 2012 U.S. law that targeted Russian officials allegedly involved in the fraud and his death -- a law that outraged the Kremlin and prompted Putin to ban the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\n\nSince then, there has been a shady lobbying campaign in Washington to undermine the narrative of Magnitsky\u2019s death and the tax fraud, as well as a later law on human rights abusers that also bore Magnitsky\u2019s name.\n\nThe lobbying campaign also involved a screening of a Russian director\u2019s film that took a semifictionalized look at Magnitsky\u2019s whistle-blowing actions and his death.\n\nThe screening, at Washington\u2019s Newseum, happened on June 13, 2016, four days after Veselnitskaya attended a meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, and other officials from Trump\u2019s election campaign.\n\nIn that meeting, Veselnitskaya said she discussed the Russian adoption ban with Donald Trump Jr.\n\nE-mails later released by Donald Trump Jr. showed that the meeting was organized by a British music promoter with Russian business ties, Rob Goldstone.\n\nGoldstone told Donald Trump Jr. that \u201cthe crown prosecutor of Russia\u201d was offering \u201cto provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.\"\n\nDonald Trump Jr. responded by e-mail: \"I love it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with NBC News set to be aired late on April 27, Veselnitskaya appears to acknowledge that she worked closely with Chaika.\n\n\u201cSince 2013, I have been actively communicating with the office of the Russian prosecutor-general,\u201d Veselnitskaya was quoted as saying.", "description": "Newly released e-mails from a Russian lawyer involved in a U.S. money-laundering case showed the lawyer had close contact with officials from the Russian Prosecutor-General\u2019s Office, even as she portrayed herself as a private citizen.", "authors": ["Mike Eckel"], "top_image": "https://gdb.rferl.org/77F233C5-4013-4297-88CC-79719A4A93EF_w1200_r1_s.jpg", "published_at": "2018-04-27"}
