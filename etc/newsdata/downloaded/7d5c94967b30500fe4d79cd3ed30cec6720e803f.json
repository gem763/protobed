Here's Why.", "language": "en", "text": "Progressive darling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took aim at Democratic leadership for failing to impeach President Donald Trump. According to AOC, the problem isn't Trump's \"lawbreaking behavior,\" it's the fact that the Democratic Party refuses to move forward with impeachment proceedings.\n\nAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019\n\nThe Atlantic's James Fallows responded to the tweet, saying he disagreed with Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIMO, this is \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d of its own sort.\n\n\n\nWhat Trump is doing remains objectively the biggest threat, scandal, and problem.\n\n\n\nSecond-ranking: the silent acquiescence of the GOP Senate.\n\n\n\nThen: it\u2019s time for House to act. \u2014 James Fallows (@JamesFallows) September 22, 2019\n\nShe reiterated her position and explained why she believes it's time for Democrats to impeach the president.\n\nIt is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It\u2019s another to let him.\n\n\n\nThe integrity of our democracy isn\u2019t threatened when a president breaks the law. It\u2018s threatened when we do nothing about it.\n\n\n\nThe GOP\u2019s silence & refusal to act shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Ours is. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019\n\nIt's not surprising that Ocasio-Cortez is upset with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The two have been at odds with each other on a number of issues. Pelosi has made it clear the Democratic Party would not move forward with impeachment proceedings, especially before the 2020 election. The reason? She's worried about alienating voters... and she knows Trump will us Democrats' desires for impeachment to campaign on.", "description": "She's not happy..09/22/2019 19:06:58PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/170/bb6e1a6e-dcf4-4831-9193-5dbb717b4edf.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
