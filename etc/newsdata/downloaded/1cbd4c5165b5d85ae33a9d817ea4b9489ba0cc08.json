Russia detained two North Korean boats in its territorial waters in the Sea of Japan on Sept. 17 after one of them attacked a Russian patrol.\n\nIn that incident, Russia said it detained one of the vessels for poaching, prompting a second boat to open fire. Several border guards and alleged poachers were hurt and one of the North Koreans later died from his wounds.\n\nMoscow summoned a North Korean diplomat over the incident.\n\nThe countries have had disputes over fishing in the region in the past.\n\nMoscow in July accused Pyongyang of illegally detaining one of its fishing vessels. North Korea said the crew had been detained for breaching the rules for entering its territory.", "description": "Russian border guards detained three North Korean fishing vessels and 262 crew members for poaching in waters that Moscow considers its exclusive economic zone, the Interfax news agency reported on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
