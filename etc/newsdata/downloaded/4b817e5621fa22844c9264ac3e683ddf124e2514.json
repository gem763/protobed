She was busted after the father of the victim found sexual messages from Esposito on his son's phone\n\nAn arrest report obtained by DailyMailTV details how Esposito, who volunteered for a slew of charities in addition to working as marketing specialist for an insurance company, began coming on to the victim, now 17.\n\nThe boy told police last week that, sometime in July 2018 after he turned 16, he walked passed by Esposito while she was washing dishes in the kitchen one afternoon.\n\nShe allegedly 'backed into his genital area with her buttocks' and brazenly began to rub against him and told him not to tell his dad, the report states.\n\nAccording to the boy's statement to police, he let her continue rubbing.

The teen told police she allegedly first made sexual contact with him last July when she rubbed her buttocks against his genital area and told him not to tell his dad\n\nThe boy said he and Esposito often arranged for their trysts through text messages.\n\nPolice discovered a video on his cellphone believed to be Esposito masturbating. The teen told cops she sent him several suggestive videos and photos.\n\nIn time, the boy said he started feeling distant from his father and became 'afraid to tell him what was happening because he didn't want to lose him.'\n\nHe did admit to police he initiated several of the sexual encounters even if Esposito 'initiated the majority of them.'\n\nThe boy's father reported Esposito to police October 7 after his son was shot in the hand while firing guns on cans with his friends and ended up at the hospital.\n\nIt was there that the dad started browsing through his son's cellphone while at the hospital, and he found the text messages and photos the suspect sent his son.\n\nWhen father and son sat down with police for interviews, cops had the dad call Esposito on a recorded line. He told Esposito he wanted to talk to her about the fact she had sex with his underage son.\n\nEsposito denied having sex with the boy but told the father: 'It's a situation that's over with. I don't need to talk about it any longer.'\n\nThe victim's father told DailyMail.com Esposito had been wrestling with a sex addiction.\n\nEsposito, the mother of a 12-year-old boy, from Vero Beach, Florida, allegedly had a 15-month sexual relationship with her boyfriend's teen son which began when he was 16\n\nThe teen also claimed his 'stepmom' had sent him several suggestive videos and photos of herself and alleged the two had anal sex on the living room couch and in the back seat of her car\n\n'It's a crime of opportunity,' she said. 'My son was there, and she just wanted to have sex.'\n\nHe described a rocky seven-year relationship with Esposito where plans to marry never materialized.\n\n'We were supposed to get married in September 2018,' he said, 'but we called it off.'\n\nThe father, 47, said he and Esposito broke up a month ago after he discovered she was cheating on him with another man.\n\n'And there was another guy before that,' he said.\n\nWhen asked if he holds his son responsible as well, the father said he doesn't.\n\n'He's a child,' he said. 'He was under the influence of a predator. She should be in prison for the maximum time allowed. I don't care how long that is.\n\n'She is broken inside and now my son could end up like her. I'm seeking counseling for him. He needs to know that's not how people behave toward each other. That's not how you treat women, and how he should be treated.'\n\nMeanwhile, in the bourgeois coastal town of Vero Beach, word of Esposito's arrest has spread like wildfire.\n\nJust last week, Esposito shared photos on Facebook from a fancy fundraiser for a child abuse organization that she worked on, with politicians such as Florida State Rep. Erin Grall and law enforcement officials including Indian River County Sheriff's Office Major Eric Flowers.\n\nIn September, she posted photos of her Volunteer of The Year certificate, courtesy of the local chamber of commerce.\n\nEarlier this year, she published photos of her son's sixth grade trip to Cape Canaveral that she chaperoned.\n\nAnd there are countless photos of her victim's family at outings and events.\n\n'The worst is that police are telling me she still doesn't think she did anything wrong,' the victim's dad said.", "description": "Valerie Esposito, 37, was charged with three counts of sexual battery on a child under her custody, and one count of lewd computer solicitation of a child following her arrest in Vero Beach last Tuesday.", "authors": ["Jose Lambiet For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/18/20001200-0-image-a-47_1571678759494.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
