(Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nEveryone knows there\u2019s a problem with Chubbs.\n\nDirt is smeared across his face. His tongue is rolling out of his mouth. He\u2019s surrounded by signs that say \u201cNO EXCESSIVE BARKING.\u201d\n\nBut the 5-month-old golden retriever does not know how to read. At a dog park in one of Maryland\u2019s wealthiest suburbs, he spends this sunny August morning rolling on his back. He opens his mouth, and then, he does it.\n\nHe woofs. Twice.\n\n\u201cCHUBBS!\u201d four humans around him yell, trying to stop him from doing what dogs do \u2014 just not in Chevy Chase Village this summer.\n\nHere in this community of the rich and powerful, where the average household income is $460,000, barking is the subject of a ferocious (fur-ocious?) debate \u2014 one that has divided the two-legged one-percenters for nearly a year.\n\nThe drama began last fall when the village spent $134,000 to turn a muddy triangle of land into a park where pups could run off-leash in a fenced refuge. Chase tennis balls. Sniff one another\u2019s butts.\n\nBut after about a month, signs decrying the barking of those dogs began appearing around the park. The village police started receiving almost daily calls about the noise, mostly from one particular neighbor whose house backs up to the park. By spring, the tension had escalated so much that the Chevy Chase Village Board of Managers called a public hearing. Then another in June. And another in July.\n\nAt the center of it all is Elissa Leonard, chair of the village board and wife to Jerome H. Powell, who is also a chair \u2014 of the Federal Reserve. In recent months, her husband has been under attack from President Trump, who appointed him but blames him for the tanking stock market. \u201cMy only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?\u201d the president tweeted Friday.\n\n....My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2019\n\nLeonard, meanwhile, is on the receiving end of a different siege: from village residents who say their peace and quiet has been disturbed by barking dogs.\n\n\u201cAround dinner time, I\u2019d like to be able to sit on my deck and maybe read a book and chat with a friend or have a glass of wine, and the dogs are barking,\u201d Joanie Edwards, the neighbor who had been calling police, testified at the meeting in May.\n\n\u201cAs residents of Chevy Chase, how many times is it acceptable for you to be bothered in your house every day?\u201d Tom Bourke, a real estate developer whose house sits across the street from the park, asked in June. \u201cYou\u2019ve created a nuisance.\u201d\n\n[A controversial dog park that divided Chevy Chase will be dismantled]\n\nThe park regulars, he acknowledged, were trying to hush their hounds. He heard that they were ostracizing the yappiest dogs, including, he told the board, \u201ca certain standard poodle whose name should be withheld.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are people,\u201d chimed in Bourke\u2019s wife, Dale, \u201cand I don\u2019t mean to characterize the District, but I just notice that they have District plates on their cars, and they have very little regard for us or our property . . . there are dogs barking and they\u2019re just not doing anything.\u201d\n\n\n\nA sign that reads \u201cNO EXCESSIVE BARKING\u2019 sits behind Chubbs, right, and Louie, left, a French bulldog who is the unofficial mayor of the dog park.

(Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI hear you,\u201d Leonard said again and again, with the patience of a dog trainer. She explained to the residents that no, they could not restrict access just to dogs from the immediate neighborhood (where the houses for sale currently range in price from $1.1 million to $22.5 million). The village purchased this 15,000-square-foot parcel of land in the 1980s, in part, using state money, so it had to remain open to the public. For years, it had been a favorite spot of local dog owners, so when the village wanted to update its parks, a dog park just made sense. Neighbors voiced their support. A unanimous vote followed.\n\nBut now the park was somehow both a wild canine circus sabotaging property values and a beloved gathering space for only the politest of pooches.\n\n[Listen on Post Reports: Dogs bark in park and drama ensues]\n\nLeonard, whose Norwich terrier, Pippa, does not frequent the park, tried to make both sides happy. To limit barking in the early hours, the board changed the opening time from 7 to 8 a.m. To stop outsiders from driving to Chevy Chase Village and parking on the Bourkes\u2019 street \u2014 taking the spots where the family liked their lawn maintenance service to park \u2014 the dog park was wiped from the village website. To determine the extent of the barking and the parking, the board paid $1,300 for a woman with a graduate degree in epidemiology to spend weeks studying the behavior of the dogs and their humans.\n\n\n\nStanley approaches the camera for his close-up at the Chevy Chase Village dog park. (Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nDuring 54 visits, the researcher witnessed seven dog owners who drove to the park instead of walking.\n\n\u201cOne of these people,\u201d she testified in June, \u201cdid allow his dog to relieve himself on the green space next to the street.\u201d\n\nBut on the barking, no conclusion was reached. What was minimal to some was enough for Edwards to call the police, exasperated that she had to turn on music inside her home so she didn\u2019t have to hear the dogs. She doesn\u2019t want to be the bad guy, she said in an interview. But as a retired elementary school teacher, she now spends her days at home painting. She does landscapes from her travels and portraits of people, vibrant creations so popular in her circle that friends and strangers have also commissioned her to paint their most beloved companions: their pets.\n\nShe and her husband, a lawyer, used to have dogs of their own. Her last, a black lab named Zoe, died four years ago.\n\n\u201cPeople in the community keep saying, \u2018She should get another dog, if she had a dog, it would be different,\u2019 \u201d Edwards said. \u201cWell, first of all, I am a very considerate person, and if I had a dog, and he was barking in my back yard, I would bring him in. If my children were in a restaurant crying, I would take them out.\u201d\n\nThe fence, she says, should come down, so the dog park is just a park. At a public hearing on Sept. 9, Leonard and the board may decide to do just that.\n\nThe dog lovers are planning to crowd the hearing, have organized a letter-writing campaign and started a Facebook group, Save the Chevy Chase Dog Park, with more than 100 likes.\n\n\u201cWhat are they going to do next, ban dancing?\u201d asked Pat Murphy, the group\u2019s moderator. Murphy, who lives in a nearby section of Chevy Chase, says he literally does \u201cnot have a dog in this fight.\u201d He does not own a dog. He used to take his son\u2019s miniature Australian shepherd to the park, but his son moved away this summer. Now he sometimes walks alone to the park, where every morning, the conversation returns to the handful of complaining neighbors.\n\n\u201cThey should be put in jail,\u201d said Doug Gansler, a former Maryland attorney general and an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate, while his King Charles spaniel, Jack, searched for a new dog to hump.\n\n\u201cDoug!\u201d scolded Patty Martin, mother to the park\u2019s unofficial mayor, a French bulldog named Louie, and wife to the head of gastroenterology at Washington Hospital Center. She, too, thought the complainers were being selfish.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the democratic process?\u201d Martin asked in an interview last week. \u201cWhy is the 1 percent deciding for the 99 percent?\u201d\n\n\n\nPups chase a ball as quietly as their humans can keep them. (Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThis is not verified,\u201d she continued, \u201cBut we have heard through reliable sources that this woman has threatened a lawsuit against the village over the park. Well, many dog park users are lawyers, too, so we\u2019re wondering, should we get a lawyer? Do we have grounds to sue?\u201d\n\nWhile lawyers consulted lawyers, her husband contacted media outlets. Eventually, the story made its way to this reporter, and to her recently adopted mutt, who visited the park in hopes of sniffing out what was really going on.\n\nDespite their owners\u2019 fretting, Chubbs, Jack, Louie and all the other dogs appear unaware that their joyful morning romp has caused such a kerfuffle. The aforementioned \u201cstandard poodle whose name should be withheld\u201d did not make an appearance.\n\nAfter this reporter\u2019s dog spent some time digging (for the truth, we presume), he was asked what he thought of the park.\n\nHe woofed. Twice.\n\nThe police did not arrive.", "description": "The battle over barking dogs involves the wife of the Federal Reserve chairman, a former candidate for governor and lawyers galore in the well-heeled Maryland suburb.", "authors": ["Jessica Contrera", "Enterprise Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/X-eF8BYkLQM4RpD_6Cy75zqhMig=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5MNU4RWFCMI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
