Photo: Andrew Toth/Getty Images for Entertainment Weekly\n\nNicholas Braun, otherwise known as Cousin Greg on Succession, had a lengthy conversation with Vulture ahead of the HBO show\u2019s second season, but a lot has happened since then: We\u2019ve learned what \u201cboar on the floor\u201d means, watched Cherry Jones fake-serve a dinner roast, and wondered if a cruise scandal might take down Waystar Royco. In light of Sunday night\u2019s episode, \u201cDC,\u201d and with next week\u2019s finale on the horizon, we caught up with Braun to talk all things Succession, including Kendall\u2019s rap, how much trouble Greg might be in after Tom\u2019s disastrous congressional testimony, the current whereabouts of those cruise documents, and whether Greg the Egg could ever jump to the dark side.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Kendall\u2019s rap. Greg seemed like he was pretty into it!\n\nI think Greg supported Kendall\u2019s expression of himself. Greg was just cheering him on. They\u2019re like roommates. They live in the same building, and I think Kendall was going over his rap with Greg ahead of the ceremony. So it wasn\u2019t a surprise to Greg. He might\u2019ve even known some of the lyrics, and he was pretty psyched about how it was received.\n\nHow many times did Jeremy Strong launch into that performance?\n\nI can\u2019t remember how many times. It was definitely enjoyable every single time. It didn\u2019t get old, ever. He worked really hard on it, Jeremy, and he just destroyed it. He surprised everyone that he was actually very good at rapping. Who knew? But in the pilot he\u2019s rapping to the Beastie Boys. That\u2019s the first thing out of his mouth. Maybe we should\u2019ve known better.\n\nHis Logan jersey, Jeremy finagled one of those for me, which was really nice. So I\u2019ve got an L to the OG jersey back in New York.\n\nDo you wear it around? If people don\u2019t recognize you already, they definitely will if they see you in that shirt.\n\nIt\u2019s me representing the Roy family, Roys\u2019 family values, and I think the streets of New York will respond well to it. Hopefully, they\u2019ll just start singing that hook. It\u2019s pretty catchy: L to the OG.\n\nI also want to ask about the term \u201cGregxit.\u201d Have you incorporated that into your daily vocab yet, or not so much?\n\nAs Nick, I have not been using the term Gregxit.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\n\nBut it is definitely one of the best lines that they gave me this season. I got the script and I was like, \u201cOh my God, of course. How did we not think of it before?\u201d But I never would have thought of it because these guys are just on another level. I cherished that line and really wanted to make sure that it felt like an actual thing I\u2019m saying, not just because it\u2019s a great line, but because Greg actually is debating whether he has to leave, or whether he\u2019s saying that as a bluff to Logan to gauge his reaction.\n\nDo you think Logan is serious when he tells Greg that he likes him, or is he just trying to keep him in the fold to spite his brother?\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit of both. Greg wouldn\u2019t have been able to hang around so long unless Logan did see some potential in him. I also think the brother dynamic is always going to be there. However he can get one over on his brother, he\u2019s going to take that opportunity. Logan always wants to win.\n\nGreg turned down a quarter of a billion dollars from his grandfather. Why do you think he did that? What does he get from being around the Roys that makes him willing to turn down such a huge fortune?\n\nHe\u2019s making a really good salary, but $250 million would be crazy. Obviously, it\u2019s not all about the money. It\u2019s about what that family makes him feel like. He\u2019s a single child with a single mother and a grandfather who\u2019s such a downer. There are human draws to this other side of the family. It\u2019s more exciting. It\u2019s more chaotic and obviously some of their values aren\u2019t the same as his, but he\u2019s living this dream life. He\u2019s drunk on it, maybe addicted to it, and he\u2019s just too deep to pack up his bags and call it quits. And then what? Wait for his grandpa to die and have a bunch of money? And then what? He\u2019s forming relationships, he\u2019s learning skills, he\u2019s getting to put on a suit and go to work every day, and he\u2019s getting to fly to hunting trips. All the spoils are just too great.\n\nThe big focus of the \u201cDC\u201d episode is the congressional hearing. Based on what\u2019s discussed during the testimony, members of Congress are aware of the documents that Tom and Greg destroyed. How much trouble, on a scale of one to 10, could Greg potentially be in?\n\nHe could go to jail. There would be real legal problems for him. If they wanted to prosecute him, they would have a case. If jail is 10, then 10. Maybe it\u2019s a white collar jail, so it\u2019s a nine and a half? He\u2019s not in with the murderers. But yeah, that could definitely be a really, really bad situation.\n\nBut he also saves at least a couple documents. I assume that decision will be significant in some way, right?\n\nThose documents still do exist. He also tried to voice memo the document burning a bit. So he\u2019s got a couple of pieces that he might be able to play, depending on what he actually salvaged out of that pit.\n\nWas that vague enough for you?\n\nThat was perfectly vague and yet quasi-informative.\n\nGood, good, good.\n\nGreg can seem so naive, but then he does something like grabbing those documents to cover his own butt. It\u2019s also hard to gauge where exactly he fits on the spectrum of good people and bad people. Is that something that you wrestle with as you\u2019re playing him?\n\nYeah, definitely. Greg lives in that gray area. He\u2019s more on the ethical, moral, decent values side of the coin than most of the Roys, but all of us are susceptible to doing bad things to get what we think we want. Yeah, he\u2019s slipping from his own moral compass. But at the same time, he might do the right thing with the document, you know? Or he might take over a department and be a source of decency at ATN or wherever he gets put.\n\nI believe that Greg he is a source of good, but it\u2019s fun to see what feels right in terms of letting him get tarnished. I don\u2019t know how far that will go, but it\u2019s definitely something that Jesse [Armstrong] and I try to navigate \u2014 let Greg get influenced, but maybe not completely, fully manipulated, by the way that they do things.\n\nIs he capable of going completely to the dark side?\n\nI don\u2019t know. There\u2019s some stuff that happens in the finale that feels like Greg is stretching himself in ways to \u2026 yeah. Oh shit. I want to tell you stuff, but I can\u2019t. In the finale, he gets put up against some walls and makes decisions that are indicative of how far he is willing to go to be a Roy.\n\nAt the end of this week\u2019s episode, Logan says to Shiv that they need to make a \u201cblood sacrifice.\u201d I\u2019m not asking you to tell me, but would Greg be a potential sacrifice? He\u2019s blood, but he\u2019s not super-close blood. Even though he has a connection to the documents, he\u2019s not quite as central as someone like Tom or Kendall. What can you say about that?\n\nI can say that there are a lot of names on the table for the blood sacrifice, and Greg is in that mix. But yeah, that\u2019s all I can say.\n\nIf things do get hairier for Greg, whether it\u2019s in the finale or at some other point in the future, which of his qualities do you think is most likely to serve him well?\n\nGreg is a bit of a shape shifter. If he gets into a sticky situation, he usually shifts into the right thing. He\u2019s been watching and learning a lot from these people. He\u2019s equipping himself with the right stuff. He\u2019s a pretty good liar. In the pilot, he has this phone call with his mother where he tells her about he picked up a hitchhiker who was smoking weed in his car. Really, he was just smoking weed in his car. Maybe he can\u2019t fool his mom, but generally, he\u2019s a good liar. That helps him turn into stuff that he isn\u2019t, necessarily.\n\nWell, I hope he becomes Tom\u2019s boss at some point. Just because I would like to watch that dynamic play out.\n\nOh my gosh, how fun that would be? Oh man. I don\u2019t know how that would happen. I feel like that\u2019s just too delicious. But hopefully, there\u2019s something like that. As long as I get to keep working with Matthew [Macfadyen], I\u2019ll be happy in any capacity.\n\nEven when he\u2019s throwing water bottles at you.\n\nHe could do that every week and I\u2019d be just fine with it.", "description": "A conversation with Nicholas Braun, who plays Cousin Greg on Succession, about the episode \u201cDC\u201d and the Succession season two finale.", "authors": ["Jen Chaney"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/04/04-nicholas-braun-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
