They died in service, at work,\u201d said Macron, who was also met privately with families of the victims.\n\nFrench prosecutors are investigating the killings as a potential act of terrorism as it transpired the knifeman likely had links with members of an ultra-conservative Islamic movement.\n\n\u201cThe whole nation (must) unite, mobilize, act\u2026 We will only win if our country gets up to fight against this underground Islamism that corrupts the children of France,\u201d he added.\n\nHe proposed establishing a \u201csociety of vigilance\u201d to protect France, a country still reeling from numerous extremist attacks in recent years \u2013 but he warned the French against \u201csuspicion that corrodes.\u201d\n\nThough Interior Minister Christophe Castaner initially said there were \u201cno warning signs\u201d before the attack, he has since acknowledged breaches in security over a failure to detect signals of the attacker\u2019s radicalization. The man had previously \u201cjustified\u201d the deadly 2015 Islamic extremist attack on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in front of his colleagues. No written report was made at the time.\n\nIt took about 24 hours after the attack for authorities to say it was a potential act of terrorism, and the French government initially maintained there was nothing to suggest the armed attacker had any ties to extremist groups.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at the National Assembly, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe paid tribute to the police officers and intelligence services\u2019 efforts to fight against extremism.\n\nBREAKING \u2014 Macron\u2019s France: Four Police Officers Stabbed to Death in Paris HQ https://t.co/3slw0v1Ni9 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 3, 2019\n\n\u201cThey are doing exceptional work. Their success are often discreet \u2026 Their failures -because there are some in the war we are waging \u2013 their failures are always tragic,\u201d Philippe said.\n\nHe added that all individuals working in the country\u2019s intelligence services will undergo a full security check to search for \u201csignals\u201d of radicalization that could have been missed.\n\nA parliamentary inquiry into the case will open next week, the National Assembly announced.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Castaner posthumously bestowed France\u2019s highest award, the Legion of Honor, on the four victims. The knifeman was shot dead by a rookie officer who had completed police academy training six days before the attack.\n\nAuthorities said the attacker had worked for the Paris police force at the computer department of the intelligence unit since 2003 and didn\u2019t have a history of psychiatric problems. He had security clearance.\n\nTuesday\u2019s ceremony came as justice officials said French investigators found a USB stick belonging to the killer containing information about his colleagues.\n\nOfficials didn\u2019t immediately confirm several French media reports that the memory stick contained \u201cjihadi propaganda.\u201d", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron led a national tribute Tuesday to the four police employees slain in last week's knife attack in Paris, calling them \"victims of Islamic terrorism.\"", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1174460430-e1570554462784-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
