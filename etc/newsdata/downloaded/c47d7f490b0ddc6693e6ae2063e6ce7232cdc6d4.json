United plans to cancel 9,500 flights from September to Dec. 19, by which time it expects the MAX to be cleared for carrying passengers.\n\nUnited\u2019s fleet included 14 MAX jets at the time of their grounding, with more scheduled for delivery throughout the year.\n\nBoeing has developed a fix for the software system implicated in both crashes, and has said it thinks the MAX can gain regulatory approval to resume service early in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe timeline is cutting it close for the holiday season, when a surge of travelers will descend on airports around the country. Cancelling MAX flights now helps airlines avoid having to scramble flight schedules if the aircraft stays grounded longer than expected. But it also means carriers will be less able to capitalize on high demand.\n\nSome airlines have given up on the prospect of flying the MAX this year. Southwest Airlines Co. and Air Canada are keeping the plane out of their schedules until early January.\n\nOnce regulators allow the MAX to return, it could take upward of six weeks for airlines to install the new software, train pilots, and get their aircraft ready to fly again, Andrew Watterson, chief revenue officer at Southwest, said in an interview this week.\n\n\u201cThat is quite a lag from the ungrounding order,\u201d he said.\n\nOther carriers remain optimistic that they will be able to use the MAX to handle year-end holiday travel. American Airlines Group Inc. still aims to resume MAX flying in early November. Panama City-based carrier Copa Holdings SA has the plane on its schedules again beginning Dec. 15.\n\nRelated Video Two crashes and the global grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX commercial airliner led to extensive disruption in the international aerospace industry.
