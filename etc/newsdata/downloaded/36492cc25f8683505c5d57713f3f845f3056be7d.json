Efforts to build a border wall and combat \u201csanctuary\u201d policies will suffer unless the 9th Congressional District sends another GOP member to Washington, he said.\n\n\u201cGet your votes in early,\u201d Mr. Trump told the crowd at the Crown Expo Center in Fayetteville. \u201cYou\u2019ll get out to protect your family.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said the U.S. still has the best economy in the world, despite murmurs of a possible recession and fears that tariffs on Chinese goods will hurt American consumers.\n\n\u201cThey tried the Russia thing, that didn\u2019t work. They tried many other things,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a riff against Democrats and the media.\n\nMr. Trump said he won\u2019t back down in his fight against China, saying it needs to be done.\n\nHe pledged to protect the Second Amendment, as Congress debates whether to tighten gun laws, and frequently pivoted to border security in promoting Mr. Bishop, saying no one wants illegal immigrants \u201croaming free\u201d in North Carolina.\n\n\u201cMr. President, we\u2019re not tired of winning,\u201d Mr. Bishop said from the stage. \u201cWe want to keep on winning.\u201d\n\nMr. Bishop, a state senator, mimicked Mr. Trump\u2019s attack lines, castigating the \u201cdishonest media\u201d and lambasting \u201csocialist\u201d Democrats.\n\nThe candidate\u2019s remarks were interrupted for several minutes by a rally-goer who needed medical attention.\n\n\u201cI guess Dan\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t so good,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nBeyond Mr. Bishop, the president said he backs Republican Greg Murphy in Tuesday\u2019s election to replace the late Rep. Walter Jones in the 3rd Congressional District.\n\nNorth Carolina is among six top-tier states that Mr. Trump won in 2016 \u2014 and that surrogates view as pivotal to his reelection hopes in 2020. The others are Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nMr. Trump was unable to tour Hurricane Dorian damage on the Carolina coast, as scheduled, ahead of the rally because of more bad weather, though he received a briefing aboard Air Force One and praised the state\u2019s toughness from the stage.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina will truly recover so fast, I know you people so well. Let\u2019s not even talk about it,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump took swipes at his predecessor and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who is leading the 2020 Democratic primary field. He said the Obama administration\u2019s trade policies, alone, were a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d and an ad for his reelection.\n\n\u201cYou could have kissed many of your industries goodbye,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nHe also said his Democratic rivals would give health coverage to illegal immigrants, while taking away private health coverage from citizens. The president insisted the GOP can come up with a better health plan, despite its high-profile failure to do so with congressional majorities in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna end up with a better plan, you watch,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president\u2019s immediate task is giving Mr. Bishop an edge over Democrat Dan McCready in the 9th District, which spans eastward from Charlotte into counties along the South Carolina border.\n\n\u201cTomorrow you will head to the polls to elect a congressman who always puts America first, Dan Bishop,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s special election was called after the 2018 edition was tainted by accusations of fraud by a GOP operative. State officials invalidated results that had Republican Mark Harris leading Mr. McCready by about 900 votes.\n\nMr. Trump won this district by 11 percentage points on the way to gobbling up the Tarheel State\u2019s 15 electoral votes in 2016, so a GOP loss would be a black eye for the president.\n\nOn the flip side, a Bishop victory would allow Mr. Trump to crow about his influence, after the GOP forfeited the House majority last year.\n\n\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t want to deal with another House seat loss and the invariable bad publicity such an outcome would bring, and to the extent his rallies can help, his presence could bring some extra attention to a race where turnout is going to be below that of the midterm,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \u201cWhether that attention actually helps Bishop is hard to quantify.\u201d\n\nMr. Kondik said the race appears to be a true tossup, with polls generally mixed on who is leading.\n\n\u201cThe margin seems likely to be close, which given that NC-9 is a Republican-leaning district, gives the Democrats better grounds on which to declare a moral victory if they fall short than Republicans\u201d would have, Mr. Kondik said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence made a surprise visit to a pro-Bishop call center in Charlotte on Monday and even dialed a few potential voters himself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about turnout,\u201d Mr. Pence told callers, urging them to keep dialing. \u201cElections are won by the people that show up.\u201d\n\nLater Monday, Mr. Pence ate with Mr. Bishop at Rock Store BBQ in Marshville, North Carolina.\n\nThe vice president received a warm welcome from diners and owner Don Stegall, who called Mr. Pence the most famous guest he\u2019d ever served, though fans of professional wrestling might dissent on that point.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d only had Ric Flair before,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
