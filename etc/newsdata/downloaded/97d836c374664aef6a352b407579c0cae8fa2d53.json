He might be a couple of kilos down on what he was before, but that won't affect him in the game.'\n\nWales held off an Australia fightback to record a thrilling 29-25 Rugby World Cup win in Tokyo\n\nUnbeaten Wales follow their epic narrow win over Australia by taking on Fiji in Oita on Wednesday, then meet Uruguay in Kumamoto four days later.\n\nStridgeon believes Beard and his fellow squad members are 'in a good place' as their preparations continue in Beppu, knowing that victory would secure a potential clash against France in the quarter-finals.\n\n'The boys were a bit beaten up after the Australia game, so we had a couple of recovery days, then an optional session on day three, post-game,' he said.\n\n'We worked really hard at the pre-World Cup camps, but we also train very intensively when we are together in a Test week.\n\nWales are likely to encounter England or France in the quarter-finals if they finish top of Pool D\n\n'All our coaches know that being strong and fit benefits the team massively in our games, and they back us up on that. They are always banging that fitness drum with us.\n\n'It's the best-prepared squad I've worked with by far. The game is so much more running-based now, the contacts are bigger and it takes the boys a lot longer to recover from the games.\n\n'When I started in 2002, the game was totally different. You wouldn't recognise it.\n\n'Because of the laws of the game, I think players will stop getting much bigger. It's much more of a running-based game. You don't see massive 140kg props any more because of the amount of running.\n\n'It will level out and players' bodyweights will plateau. The game is getting faster all the time as players get fitter and faster, but I can't see it going much further with the rules we have now.'", "description": "The 23-year-old Ospreys forward is nearing a return following an operation on the day Wales left for the tournament after complaining of stomach pains as he boarded the plane to Tokyo.", "authors": ["Ben Miller For Mailonline", "Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/13/19360232-0-image-a-4_1570363531359.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
