(Photo by Mike Lawrie/Getty Images)\n\nBrooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant was in the mood to drop some fiery takes Tuesday. During the same interview in which Durant said the Knicks were not cool anymore, he also made the bold proclamation that the Cleveland Cavaliers \u2014 and not the 73-win Golden State Warriors \u2014 were the most talented team during the 2015-16 season.\n\nThe 31-year-old Durant made that comment during a lengthy interview with Hot 97 in New York.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEven KD thinks the 2016 Cavs were the most talented team in the league. pic.twitter.com/AEjNurskGv \u2014 jeremiah (@_2human) October 8, 2019\n\nThe conversation started after Durant was asked about the most devastating losses he\u2019s suffered as a pro. Durant shrugs off the suggestion that the Oklahoma City Thunder losing to the Warriors in 2015-16 was one of the worst losses of his career. He explains that he felt like the Thunder had an \u201cuphill climb\u201d in 2015-16 due to the strength of their opponents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing against a 73-win team in the Warriors, and the Spurs who were a 67-win team that year. And then the Cavs were the best team in the league \u2014 most talented team \u2014 so I\u2019m like, \u2018We\u2019ve got an uphill climb, let\u2019s just see what we can do.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe 2015-16 Cavaliers went on to defeat the Warriors in the NBA Finals. The series went to Game 7, but LeBron James and the Cavs were able to pull out a win. It was Cleveland\u2019s first major sports title since 1964.\n\nDurant became a free agent that offseason and decided to join the Warriors, and Golden State went on to win two championships with Durant.\n\nStory continues\n\nDurant caught a lot of flack for that decision. A number of NBA fans criticized him for making the best team in the league \u2014 the Warriors \u2014 an even bigger juggernaut. Durant doesn\u2019t seem to think that was the case, but fans aren\u2019t likely to buy that narrative.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
