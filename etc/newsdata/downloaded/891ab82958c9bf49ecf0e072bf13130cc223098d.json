(\u201cTrump Declares ISIS \u2018100%\u2019 Defeated in Syria. 100% Not True,\u2019 Ground Reports Say,\u201d a New York Times headline read in February.) The ISIS leader\u2019s demise has been, in its own way, a catalyst. And the attention itself helps, in its way, to carry on Foley\u2019s work: He went to Syria in the first place because of the stories that he believed needed to be told.\n\nIn his murder, ISIS tried to turn James Foley, the person, into James Foley, the symbol. The group tried to treat Foley as a stand-in for America itself. (The video of Foley\u2019s death\u2014ISIS titled it \u201cA Message to America\u201d\u2014included the group\u2019s declaration that Foley\u2019s execution was intended as retaliation for U.S. military actions in Iraq.) In the years since his death, however, Foley\u2019s family and colleagues\u2014including many of the people with whom he was held captive, who were freed\u2014have worked to effect another kind of justice: to ensure that Foley, despite all his tragic symbolism, would be remembered in his full and individual complexity.\n\nIn the aftermath of her son\u2019s capture, Diane Foley, as those touched by tragedy sometimes will, became an accidental activist: She advocated on behalf of James, first fighting for his release and then, after his death, speaking on behalf of the many other people who are still held hostage by ISIS and other groups. She founded and leads the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, which advocates for the safe return of those hostages and works to help protect freelance journalists working in conflict zones. Because of that work, Foley was one of the small group of people who learned that Baghdadi had died before President Trump announced the news yesterday morning: On Saturday night, Foley told me, she and her family received a phone call from the FBI\u2019s Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell informing them only that, as Foley put it, \u201cone valuable target had been located.\u201d\n\nDiane Foley learned the extent of the new before most other Americans\u2014this time in a call from Robert O\u2019Brien, the Trump administration\u2019s special presidential envoy for hostage affairs (and, as of September, its national security advisor). O\u2019Brien confirmed to Foley what would soon be widely reported: Baghdadi was dead. He had killed himself, reportedly detonating a suicide vest while being pursued by American forces in northwest Syria.\n\nAnd so came, for Foley, that repeated horror\u2014the re-opening of wounds that can never be fully healed. But the pain was accompanied by something else, as well: a sense of relief. \u201cI\u2019m grateful, I\u2019m very grateful, that we still had U.S. troops in country,\u201d she said of Syria, \u201cand that our intelligence and our president chose to pursue Baghdadi and find him.\u201d Foley has been vocal about her conviction that ISIS members should stand trial, rather than being killed in theaters of war; she has said as well that, when it comes to justice for convicted ISIS fighters, she prefers life imprisonment to the death penalty. In this case, though, she told me, \u201cBaghdadi would not allow himself to be captured.\u201d Her years of advocacy have given her an expertise in ISIS\u2019s innerworkings; tragedy\u2019s education has led her to see Baghdadi\u2019s suicide in broad, and historical, terms. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful,\u201d she said of his death, \u201cthat it\u2019s a blow to ISIS.\u201d The rest of what she sees and feels in this moment is deeply, unavoidably personal.", "description": "The journalist James Foley wanted to understand Syrians who had no voice.
