Your diet is a critical factor in how all of your body systems operate, especially your digestive system. And one group of very common foods, FODMAPs, is a well-known IBS trigger, and avoiding them can be the key to relieving the bloating, diarrhea, nausea, constipation and other symptoms of IBS.\n\nWhat are FODMAPs?\n\nFermentable\n\nOligosaccharides\n\nDisaccharides\n\nMonosaccharides\n\nPolyols\n\nWhat are common high FODMAPs foods?\n\nVegetables and legumes : Garlic, onion, artichokes, cauliflower, most beans (black, kidney, soy, lima, butter, broad and haricot), peas, scallions, shallots, asparagus, mushrooms, and sauerkraut.\n\n: Garlic, onion, artichokes, cauliflower, most beans (black, kidney, soy, lima, butter, broad and haricot), peas, scallions, shallots, asparagus, mushrooms, and sauerkraut.

Meats: Sausage and chorizo.\n\nFODMAPs stands for:Each of these is a type of short-chain carbohydrate that some people cannot fully digest. Instead, FODMAPs pass through the stomach to the far end of your intestines. The bacteria in your intestines then use these carbohydrates for food. And their digestion process makes hydrogen gas causing IBS symptoms such as excessive gas, nausea, bloating, constipation and more. FODMAPs can also cause diarrhea by drawing liquid into your intestines. FODMAPs are present in many everyday foods. They are so common, in fact, that you may be sensitive to them but not realize it. I know that\u2019s been the case with many of my patients. So, if you\u2019ve been struggling with IBS symptoms, the problem could be a diet high in FODMAPs.The list of high FODMAP foods is pretty extensive, including foods you\u2019d think are perfectly healthy (and that I\u2019ve recommended that you eat more frequently). But eliminating them from your diet is a good way to tell if FODMAP consumption is related to your IBS.\n\nCommon Low FODMAPs Foods\n\nVegetables and legumes : Lentils, broccoli, carrots, eggplant, kale, ginger, chives, chick peas, brussels sprouts, squash, potatoes, olives, lettuce, pumpkins, spinach, tomatoes, and more.\n\n: Lentils, broccoli, carrots, eggplant, kale, ginger, chives, chick peas, brussels sprouts, squash, potatoes, olives, lettuce, pumpkins, spinach, tomatoes, and more.

And this list is not comprehensive. But if you are one of the 15% of Americans that suffer from IBS, removing FODMAPs from your diet might be the key to kicking IBS to the curb. I recommend my IBS patients go four weeks eating only low FODMAP foods. This can seem difficult given when you look at the above list, but I promise you there\u2019s plenty of flavorful foods left to choose from.So\u2026I\u2019ve listed the foods you should avoid, it\u2019s only fair that I give you a list of foods you should eat more of. These are low-FODMAP foods to add to your shopping list.\n\nCreating Your Own Low FODMAP Diet Plan\n\nBreakfast Lunch Dinner Dessert Monday Spinach & kale omelet w/ mozzarella cheese Chicken salad w/ roasted pumpkin and pine nuts Beef tacos w/ chopped tomatoes, lettuce and corn Orange flour-less cake Tuesday Green smoothie w/ spinach, kale, kiwi, pineapple & ginger Tuna salad w/ brown rice, cubed cheese, capers and olives Chicken satay kababs w/ potato salad Chocolate and peanut butter cake in a mug Wednesday Low FODMAP muesli with fresh berries and almond milk Low FODMAP flatbread w/ eggplant, mozzarella, tomato, & fresh basil Beef goulash w/ polenta Low FODMAP fruit and marshmallow kebabs Thursday Poached eggs on low FODMAP toast Brown rice & quinoa salad w/ feta and roasted veggies Stuffed bell peppers w/ bacon, zucchini feta, and brown rice Pina colada sorbet w/ coconut cream, pineapple, and mint Friday Chocolate protein shake Mexican soup w/ chicken, seasoned veggies, and corn chips Grilled salmon w/ steamed broccoli and garden salad Raspberry and dark chocolate chip muffins Saturday Scrambled eggs on low FODMAP toast Rice paper rolls w/ chicken and veggies Gluten-free lasagna and side salad Chia seed pudding w/ muesli and dark chocolate chips Sunday Lactose-free yogurt w/ berries and oats Stir-fry w/ chicken, ginger, lemongrass, bok choy, and bell peppers Cottage pie w/ pumpkin and potato mash Low FODMAP fruit salad\n\nNow let\u2019s put that shopping list to action by planning meals with all of these delicious foods.Now, I know what you are thinking. \u201cHere comes another diet plan with a weird gimmick and bland meals that I\u2019ll want to quit after two days.\u201d Believe me, I feel the same way about most \u201cdiets\u201d out there. But as you can see, the list of low FODMAPs foods is long and the possibilities are endless. Most of these foods can be found in your local grocery store. Even better, you probably eat most of these foods all the time. I\u2019ll even help you create a low FODMAP diet plan to try for a week. Here\u2019s a sample one-week diet \u2013each day contains three delicious, healthy meals and a dessert.\n\nRoadmap to IBS Relief\n\nReferences\n\nYou don\u2019t have to follow this plan to the T. Move meals around if you want. Have some meals multiple times if you really like them. The reason why most diets fail is because they fail to excite your palette. But this meal plan is anything but bland and boring -- just looking at that menu makes me hungry! Don\u2019t forget the spices! While you should avoid garlic and onion, most other spices are fair game. Think about cooking with thyme, coriander, ginger, all spice, rosemary, parsley, cilantro, paprika, or mustard. You can also flavor with a little garlic- or onion-infused oil if you really miss the taste.If you have IBS, you know how frustrating it can be to find even temporary relief. Perhaps you are feeling that right now. But, once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s not that hard to use this tried and true, evidence-based IBS remedy. And it\u2019s certainly safer than an array of prescription and over-the-counter medications, with varying merit and plentiful side effects. There are plenty of additional resources online to continue developing FODMAP recipes and meal plans \u2013 even message boards to learn from other folks who\u2019ve benefited from the low-FODMAP diet.", "description": "Whenever a patient presents with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome .09/02/2019 3:16:25AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
