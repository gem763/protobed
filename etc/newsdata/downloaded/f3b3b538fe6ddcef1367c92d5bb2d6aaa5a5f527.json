Former Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion of U.S. aid (paid by taxpayers) from Ukraine in order to get a prosecutor off his son\u2019s back. (If you can\u2019t see the crime there, I can\u2019t help you.) President Trump, who has the broad foreign policy powers enumerated in the U.S. Constitution, mentioned this malfeasance in a polite leaked conversation with Ukraine\u2019s new president.\n\nThe propaganda media and leftist elites are now screaming for the impeachment of President Trump due to this information being brought to Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s attention not by a whistleblower, but, according to The New York Times, a CIA plant in the White House. Yes, that\u2019s the same CIA that cannot legally spy in the United States on another citizen, especially the president. So there\u2019s another crime.\n\nThus, this Ukraine \u201cwhistleblower\u201d brouhaha is just another day of the president exposing the truth and crimes of members of the former administration, its members\u2019 families and the CIA. And the Democrats want people want to trust their government? No, thanks.\n\nSTEPHEN PHILLIPS\n\nKihei, Hawaii\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
