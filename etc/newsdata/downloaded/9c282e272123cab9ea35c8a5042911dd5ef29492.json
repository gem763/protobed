Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition variations of the RTX 2080 and RTX 2070 are significantly discounted, resulting in prices that, while still fairly expensive, are a bit easier to swallow.\n\nThe RTX 2080 is available at $599.99, a $200 discount from its usual cost. It comes with a download code for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which you can redeem when the game launches on October 25th, 2019.\n\nThe RTX 2070 costs just $449.99, down from $599.99. It, too, comes with a code for CoD: Modern Warfare. Admittedly, it\u2019s not tough to find other RTX 2070 models for around $500, or even slightly below, but this is a good deal.\n\nFor context on Best Buy\u2019s prices, similar graphics cards made by other OEMs usually cost only a little more than this, and their cards often come equipped with more fans and sometimes slightly higher clock speeds. Going that route might be best if you really want the most power and efficiency. If you\u2019re a purist, though, it\u2019s tough to beat the industrial design on Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition cards.\n\nSomething else worth noting is that Nvidia\u2019s \u201cSuper\u201d variants of the RTX 2080 and RTX 2070 are more powerful (if only by a little bit) than the regular RTX models, and are only slightly more costly in some cases. It\u2019s tough to find Founders Editions of either \u201cSuper\u201d variant, but an affordable alternative is Zotac\u2019s RTX 2070 Super card for only $499.99.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a deal on an Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Series 4 (44mm, GPS) is $329.97 at Amazon, $50 less than usual. Currently, the only case finish and band combo to go for this price is the silver aluminum casing with a white sport band.\n\nIf you\u2019re torn between this and the Apple Watch Series 5, a $90 difference stands between the two watches. As far as what you\u2019ll get with the more recent model, its always-on display is the Series 5\u2019s big feature. The Verge\u2019s Dieter Bohn praised the feature in the review, not just for its utility, but also because Apple found a way to keep the display from quickly draining the battery. Otherwise, the Series 4 boasts many of the same tricks, including fall detection, EKG, and a refined design.\n\nTarget is offering 25 percent off of select video games if you opt for same-day pickup at your local store. Recent titles like Borderlands 3, Control, and FIFA 20 make the cut. There are hundreds of games looped into the deal, so if you have a few on your wishlist, check out Target\u2019s landing page for the promotion.\n\nI\u2019m becoming convinced that $199.95 might be the regular price for the Beats Powerbeats Pro. These truly excellent wireless headphones started out at $249, but have been $50 off the regular price for over a week at Amazon. Each color (moss, navy, black, ivory) is available at the discount price.\n\nThe Beats Powerbeats Pro are our top pick for truly wireless headphones. Compared to the second-generation Apple AirPods, Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3, and other models, the Powerbeats Pro stand out, providing better comfort, longer battery life, and richer sound.", "description": "Best Buy is knocking hundreds off the cost of an Nvidia RTX 2080 or RTX 2070. Also, the 44mm GPS Apple Watch Series 4 is cheaper than ever, and you can save 25 percent on games when you pick them up at Target.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zYqhcnB5-VnSLmLT6bDMy7vcZn8=/0x0:2040x1068/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13109959/setienne_180914_2954_0096.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
