Core consumer prices, which exclude the volatile categories of food and energy, increased 0.3% from the previous month. This marked the third straight monthly rise of 0.3% and a pickup from earlier in 2019.\n\nPrices for a wide array of goods and services rose last month. Rent and medical prices were among the drivers behind stronger inflation in August.\n\nFrom a year earlier, consumer prices increased 1.7% in August and core consumer prices climbed 2.4%, the fastest annual pace since July 2018 when core prices also rose 2.4%.\n\nStrengthening inflation helps reassure Federal Reserve policy makers, who have frequently expressed concern this year about weak inflation.\n\nThe Fed targets 2% inflation as measured by the personal-consumption-expenditures price index, a separate gauge that includes many components of the consumer-price index. The PCE price index has been running below the central bank\u2019s target and rose 1.6% in July from a year earlier.\n\nPolicy makers see low inflation as a threat because it tends to weigh on interest rates, giving them less room to stimulate the economy in a downturn by reducing borrowing costs.\n\nA separate report showed real average hourly earnings, a measure of inflation-adjusted earnings, increased 0.4% in August from a month earlier.\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com and Likhitha Butchireddygari at likhitha.butchireddygari@wsj.com", "description": "U.S. consumer prices rose slowly in August, held down by weak energy prices that masked a broader firming in price pressures.", "authors": ["Sarah Chaney", "Likhitha Butchireddygari", "Sarah.Chaney Wsj.Com", "Likhitha.Butchireddygari Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102936/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
