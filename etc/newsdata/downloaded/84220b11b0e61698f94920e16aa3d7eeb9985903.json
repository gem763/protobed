When a military raid leads to the death of ISIS\u2019s founder and leader, it\u2019s a major development of international significance.\n\nBut also on Sunday morning, Vice President Mike Pence sat down with CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan, who asked on Face the Nation about the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing Ukraine scandal. The host noted, for example, that at least four U.S. officials have now testified under oath about their knowledge of a proposed deal with Ukraine about a Biden-related investigation. Brennan asked, \u201cAre they all lying?\u201d\n\nPence replied, \u201cWell, I can only tell you what I know. And what I know is that the transcript of [Trump\u2019s] call with President Zelensky shows that there was no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nIt was a problematic response for a few reasons. The \u201ctranscript,\u201d for example, was really more of a call summary, and it may not fully reflect a word-for-word record of what was said. What\u2019s more, the summary is actually quite incriminating \u2013 which is why the White House\u2019s allies believe it was a \u201chuge mistake\u201d for Trump to release it \u2013 a fact that\u2019s made worse by additional details that have since come to light.\n\nBut of even greater interest was Pence\u2019s assertion that he\u2019s only prepared to say what he personally knows. In other words, the vice president wasn\u2019t prepared to endorse the White House\u2019s talking points in their entirety, so much as he was willing to speak to his own narrow vantage point.\n\nThis became a problematic posture when the host asked, over and over again, whether Pence was aware of the larger scheme Team Trump was trying to execute with Ukraine. This was the final Brennan effort to get a straight answer from the vice president:\n\nBRENNAN: I haven\u2019t gotten a clear answer from you on that though, sir. I do have to leave the interview there. But are you saying that you did not ever hear of such a deal? Is that what I understand you are describing? PENCE: I\u2019m telling you that all of my interactions with [Trump], all of my conversations with President Zelensky, were entirely focused on issues of importance to the American people, ending corruption, enlisting more European support and supporting Ukraine in a way that would restore its territorial integrity and stand by Ukraine for its sovereignty.\n\nPence was given multiple opportunities to say there was no proposed quid-pro-quo deal with Ukraine. He simply wasn\u2019t willing to make the assertion.\n\nThe vice president, who has been implicated in the controversy, tried to emphasize that he personally wasn\u2019t involved in a quid-pro-quo scheme.\n\nAs Aaron Blake noted, \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear why Pence is doing this. It doesn\u2019t mean he knows there was a quid pro quo, necessarily. But it\u2019s pretty evident that he\u2019s not at all comfortable completely denying it.\u201d", "description": "Asked, over and over again, whether Pence was aware of the larger scheme Team Trump was trying to execute with Ukraine, he gave a very narrow answer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_mj_pence_191029_1920x1080.jpg?itok=KeqsrGdF", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
