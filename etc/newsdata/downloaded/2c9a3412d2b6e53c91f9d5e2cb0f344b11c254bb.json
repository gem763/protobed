That\u2019s 12km every day \u2013 and the aim is to get people talking and raise vital funds with Mo Running.\n\nLast year, James ran 6km a day for Movember to start vital conversations about men\u2019s health \u2013 especially mental health, and he was shocked by how much impact that had. Now he wants to take it a step further.\n\n\u2018On these runs, I got talking to people and was amazed about how much more people (especially men) were able to open up when we were shoulder to shoulder rather than face to face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I spoke to more than 75 people last year and I wanted to do it again. I had found a way to connect with people on this topic and I wanted to use the opportunity while I could.\n\n\u2018Men are very bad at opening up and I wanted to raise awareness that there are ways to help them do this; be in situations where they are more comfortable, such as exercise, and by \u201creaching in\u201d and asking them the right questions.\u2019\n\nJames says that he almost became a statistic when he was at his lowest in 2010. He considered taking his own life. So he know exactly how hopeless things can feel, and why support and resources are so crucial.\n\n\u2018I have been there and I know how hard it is and the pain that goes along with it,\u2019 says James. \u2018In my darkest hour, tortured by my feelings of worthlessness, inadequacy and loneliness I did not think that I could talk to anyone, including my wife and family because I \u201cknew\u201d that it would be proof that I was not a man and that I was just a weak, good for nothing, less-than-human.\n\n\u2018I had worked out my suicide plan and it was only through good fortune and the intervention of my wife, family and a brilliant GP, that I am still here today.\n\n\u2018I am now in the very fortunate position of being able to tell my story to raise awareness and hopefully persuade those in a similar situation to ask for help as well as friends to check in on their mates if they think something is wrong.\u2019\n\n\u2018I had worked out my suicide plan and it was only through good fortune and the intervention of my wife, family and a brilliant GP, that I am still here today\u2019 (Picture: James Martin)\n\nLast year saw a 13% increase in male suicide and there is still a significant stigma attached to mental ill-health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuicide is the biggest killer of men under the age of 45, and under-funding for mental health services leaves those with illnesses facing huge waiting times.\n\n\u2018This has to change and we need to get parity between physical and mental health, says James. \u2018We have no problem saying that we are going to see a physiotherapist if we have injured a muscle, but how many of us would freely admit to seeing a psychotherapist when we have a problem in our brain?\n\nJames thinks the tiredness and physical exhaustion is going to be the hardest part of his challenge, but he knows the mental side will be tough too.\n\n\u2018Last year, with 6km a day, was hard but this is double the distance every day. I started running two years ago and now run around four times a week, so it is going to be a big step up.\n\n\u2018I am training, so I feel good at this stage. However, I know it is going to be tough.\n\n\u2018The mental side is also going to be hard. Most of the runs are going to be at work or at home, and there are only a small amount of routes to take so it may be a little monotonous at times.\n\n\u2018Added to that is the fact that I am not a social runner, as I use running as my headspace and mindfulness. It gives me peace and a time where I can escape my ever chattering brain.\n\n\u2018During the challenge, I am going to be running with people and talking with them. It is a challenge for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The good thing though is that I will be talking to people about a subject that is important and that in itself will give me solace. It may be that one of those conversations will help someone realise that it is OK and good to talk.\u2019\n\nJames is hoping that his epic month of running will raise awareness about male mental health and help people feel empowered to get the help they need.\n\n\u2018I want to stop anyone feeling as I did for much of my life; unable to talk because they do not believe anyone is interested or wants to help,\u2019 explains James.\n\n\u2018I want to get people talking about this; mates talking to mates, husbands and wives talking to their significant men, sons and daughters speaking to their dads, and dads talking to their children, colleagues checking in on each other at work and teammates putting bravado aside.\u2019\n\nJames even has some practical advice for people if they\u2019re worried about a man in their life.\n\n\u2018If you know someone is acting differently or suspect that something is not right, don\u2019t shy away but put an arm around the shoulder and say: \u2018I am here for you\u201d.\n\n\u2018Get the men in your life talking. My target this Movember is to talk to 150 different people, and I hope this will inspire so many other conversations.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames is raising money and looking for sponsorship to help him hit his target of \u00a310,000 for the month.\n\nMORE: Eco-tourism: How to have a sustainable city break\n\nMORE: If you want to find love for Valentine\u2019s Day you need to start dating someone today\n\nMORE: Deaf and blind puppy named Piglet teaches kids about special needs pets\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "James had planned out his own suicide when he was at his lowest - now he's running to raise awareness about male mental illness for Movember.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/James-Martin-2-a75b_1570460796.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
