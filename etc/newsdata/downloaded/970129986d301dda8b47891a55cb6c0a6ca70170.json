What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? They didn't, they only made it worse.\"\n\nThe president went on to say that if the Taliban cannot agree to a ceasefire during the talks \"and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don't have the power to negotiate in a meaningful agreement anyway.\"\n\nTrump then questioned \"how many more decades\" the Taliban is willing to fight.\n\nThe US is struggling to end the longest war in its history\n\nThe war in Afghanistan, which began shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks, is nearly 18 years old and the longest conflict in US history.\n\nAs the Taliban continues to conduct deadly attacks in Afghanistan the Islamic State group (ISIS) has also gained a foothold in the country, which compounds the convoluted array of issues the US faces as it seeks to end its role in the long and costly war.\n\nRead more: Most American veterans say the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were 'not worth fighting,' as the US flexes its military muscles at Iran\n\nA Taliban-claimed attack killed an American soldier in Kabul on Thursday, which occurred not long after a US Green Beret from Idaho was killed in the southeastern province of Zabul on August 29, The Washington Post reported.
