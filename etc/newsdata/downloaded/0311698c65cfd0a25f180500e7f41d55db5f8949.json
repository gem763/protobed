I'm being very direct. You misunderstood my tweet that 3500 people understood correctly, and then turned it into a fight that was about your feelings rather than a systemic problem that we BOTH know is prevalent in this industry.\n\nShe continued: 'You also proudly work for a transphobic, fat phobic company @SaraSampaio. Victoria's Secret is a brand that sets out to exclude most women...\n\n'So I would check yourself on that before you start policing me for calling out an industry wide epidemic of harm to young girls.'\n\nSara clarified that she is proud of her company and although it has made mistakes she believes that it is working to rectify these errors. Before telling Jameela that she has also made 'big mistakes' in the past.\n\nNot happy: Earlier in the day, Jameela sent out a seemingly innocuous tweet about a runway show that sparked the war of words with Sara\n\nShe added: 'I'm also not someone that is going to resource on personal attacks to try and win some stupid twitter feud!'\n\nJameela was quick to hit back and encouraged Sara to speak out against Victoria's Secret's alleged misgivings in the future.\n\nThe actress penned: 'If you're speaking out against what your company did then GREAT. I look forward to seeing your activism on that with your big profile.\n\n'You seem passionate about speaking out. So best of luck to you on helping young girls and trans people in this business.'\n\nFeud: The Good Place star, 33, rehashed their heated debate on Wednesday evening when she claimed that it was 'ridiculous' that feud between the two high-profile celebrities had made the headlines\n\nWar of words: In response to Jameela's tweet, Sara told her that her 'condescending tone makes it impossible to have a conversation' with her, after insisting that it is the last she will say on the issue\n\nIn a further tweet Jameela suggested that Sara had 'misunderstood' her original tweet and stood firm on the fact she was attacking the industry rather than models.\n\nShe said: 'Also @SaraSampaio, you MISUNDERSTOOD the tweet in the first place... it was Not taking aim at *kids* for being starved and afraid. It's definitely not *their* fault.\n\n'Who on EARTH would blame children? It was taking aim at this (unbelievably f****d) industry. Which is RIGHT to do.'\n\nEarlier in the day, Jameela sent out a seemingly innocuous tweet about a runway show that sparked the war of words with Sara.\n\nOn Saturday, Jameela, retweeted a clip from Vienna Fashion Week 2018 showing the Gold Caviar Crew dancing on the runway, dancing and smiling as they paraded down the runway in traditional Nigerian clothing.\n\nJamil, a former model agent herself, tweeted, 'Oh my god This looks like the most fun, and not a long-starved terrified teenager in sight. Beautiful,' which caught the attention of Sampaio.\n\nFeud: Jameela (left) sent out a seemingly innocuous tweet about a runway show that sparked a war of words with model Sara (right)\n\nJameela's tweet: Jameela, a former model agent herself, tweeted: 'Oh my god This looks like the most fun, and not a long-starved terrified teenager in sight. Beautiful'\n\nSara, a Victoria's Secret Angel who became the first Portuguese model to be featured in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, clapped back at Jameela.\n\nAccusing Jameela of 'hypocrisy', she called out the self-confessed activist for 'bringing other people down' in her crusade to promote body positivity.\n\n'How about celebrating someone without bringing other people down?' Sara replied.\n\n'Calling runway models \"long-starved terrified teenager\" is extremely offensive. From someone that is always preaching for body positivity this just screams hypocrisy.'\n\nJameela responded minutes later, clarifying she wasn't referring to every model in her original tweet.\n\n'I didn\u2019t say all models in my tweet so try to calm down. But I will say there is a *vast* majority issue with young girls starving themselves, and using drugs and cocaine to control their weight, to meet the very small sample sizes. If you don\u2019t see that, then you are in a bubble,' Jamil said.\n\nFurious: Sara, a Victoria's Secret Angel who became the first Portuguese model to be featured in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, clapped back at Jameela\n\nShe added in another tweet, 'I also don\u2019t preach \u201cbody positivity.\u201d I talk about moving away from all talk of body, in order to combat our current pervasive issue of eating disorder culture, which is in NO small way perpetuated by the extreme thinness demanded of girls by the high fashion powers that be.'\n\nSara responded by stating that Jameela still shouldn't have felt the need to, 'attack girls just so you can celebrate others.'\n\n'Eating disorders, drugs and cocaine use aren\u2019t a exclusive problem of models, it\u2019s a huge problem is society as a whole,' Sampaio added.\n\n'And when you talk like you know for sure majority of (models) have eating disorders and drug problems, when that\u2019s not the case. And about modeling I can for sure talk with more certainty than you.\n\n'Sure that happens but it\u2019s for sure not a vast majority. The point of my tweet though, wasn\u2019t that one! And you know!' Sampaio added.\n\nClarify: Jameela responded minutes later, clarifying she wasn't referring to every model in her original tweet\n\nChill: 'I didn\u2019t say all models in my tweet so try to calm down. But I will say there is a *vast* majority issue with young girls starving themselves, and using drugs and cocaine to control their weight, to meet the very small sample sizes. If you don\u2019t see that, then you are in a bubble,' Jameela said\n\nBody positivity: She added in another tweet, 'I also don\u2019t preach \u201cbody positivity.\u201d I talk about moving away from all talk of body, in order to combat our current pervasive issue of eating disorder culture, which is in NO small way perpetuated by the extreme thinness demanded of girls by the high fashion powers that be'\n\nJameela retorted that she, 'was a model, and a model agent and a lot of my friends are still models and agents. Who are all struggling with ongoing unrealistic standards of this industry you benefit from, which is why you are fiercely defending it, and asking me not to call out its devastating wrongs.'\n\n'Sara, respectfully, I don\u2019t think this is the hill to die on. This industry is unlike other industries in that it makes professionals out of children, and informs culture and society, and is a standard set for young people everywhere. Fashion is a dangerous industry for too many,' Jameela added.\n\nThe Portuguese fashion model added, 'How is saying to not diminish other people to celebrate others negative for girls? Cause that was the point of my tweet! Period!\n\n'I never said there wasn\u2019t a problem with the industry, so don\u2019t go around and put words in my mouth! Be better than that! (sic)'\n\nJameela retorted by telling her, 'Don\u2019t police how I choose to celebrate something or call out something problematic. I was celebrating that it\u2019s a refreshing change, compared to the toxic fashion show norm.\n\nNo attack: Sara responded by stating that Jamil still shouldn't have felt the need to, 'attack girls just so you can celebrate others'\n\nRetort: Jameela retorted that she, 'was a model, and a model agent and a lot of my friends are still models and agents. Who are all struggling with ongoing unrealistic standards of this industry you benefit from, which is why you are fiercely defending it, and asking me not to call out its devastating wrongs'\n\nDebate: Sara added, 'How is saying to not diminish other people to celebrate others negative for girls? Cause that was the point of my tweet! Period! I never said there wasn\u2019t a problem with the industry, so don\u2019t go around and put words in my mouth! Be better than that! (sic)'\n\nRetort: Jameela retorted by telling her, 'Don\u2019t police how I choose to celebrate something or call out something problematic. I was celebrating that it\u2019s a refreshing change, compared to the toxic fashion show norm. I\u2019m an activist. My words aren\u2019t cute, or easy, or inoffensive. Change doesn\u2019t come from being polite'\n\n'I\u2019m an activist. My words aren\u2019t cute, or easy, or inoffensive. Change doesn\u2019t come from being polite.'\n\nShe continued: 'I\u2019m energised by the HUNDREDS of emails and messages a day I get from people about their damaged mental health and body image issues.\n\n'I\u2019m not going away until the problem goes away. (PS if anyone finds me annoying, they should help me end this problem and I will chill out!)'\n\nIn a separate tweet to another fan, Sara said: 'I said what I had to say. She\u2019s not willing to listen nor trying to understand other people\u2019s opinions... I stand by what I said! You never need to bash other people to celebrate others! No matter what.'\n\nWhen Sara went quiet on Twitter, Jameela shared a final post to celebrate having helped towards 'educating a supermodel about where best to direct her anger and sizeable power'.\n\nThe jubilant star told her followers: 'Think we all hopefully went some way to educating a supermodel about where best to direct her anger and sizeable power.\n\n'Thanks for the overwhelming support in standing up for young girls and calling out toxic systems designed to hurt them.'\n\nTweet: In a separate tweet to another fan, Sara said, 'I said what I had to say. She\u2019s not willing to listen nor trying to understand other people\u2019s opinions... I stand by what I said! You never need to bash other people to celebrate others! No matter what'\n\nShow of support: Jameela was thrilled most of her followers were on her side in the debate\n\nThumbs up! When Sara went quiet on Twitter, Jameela shared a final post to celebrate having helped towards 'educating a supermodel about where best to direct her anger and sizable power'\n\nThis isn't the first time Jameela has caused a stir with her straight-talking comments on Twitter, including GMB's Piers Morgan and the Kardashian clan.\n\nJameela recently insisted she is not interested in having 'beef' with the Kardashians or 'cancel anyone' \u2014 after she accused the reality star family of promoting unsafe body expectations when advertising detox teas and shakes.\n\nThe body activist has made headlines in the last couple of years for her public critiques of the Kardashian family on social media, calling them out for promoting laxatives and harmful diet practices.\n\nExplaining her position on why the Kardashians should stop promoting products to their fans with potentially dangerous side effects, she previously tweeted: 'Essentially, 'f*** the young, impressionable people, or those struggling with eating disorders, we want the money.\n\n'I have been given these same opportunities to flog this stuff, and I don't do it, so they don't have to. Thank you, next.'\n\nHer response didn't stop there, as Jameela continued: 'Their pockets are lined with the blood and diarrhea of teenage girls...'\n\nBut in an interview with Bustle for its Rule Breakers digital cover, Jameela said she was not trying to fight with the family \u2014 and would lay off if they'd just stop pushing products that might promote eating disorders.\n\n'I\u2019m not trying to cancel anyone,' she said, adding: 'I don\u2019t want to beef with the Kardashians. They have a huge amount of influence. I just want them to use that for more good.'\n\nControversial: Jameela has been vocal about her anger that the Kardashian family, including Kim, is known for promoting Flat Tummy Tea products on their Instagram pages\n\nNot afraid: Jameela's problems with the Kardashian family heightened after they spoke to the New York Times in March\n\nNot happy: At the time, Kim said she was not worried about Jameela's criticism. This encouraged the actress to call out the family for lining their pockets\n\nBesides speaking about the Kardashians, Jameela also answered to previously criticising Miley Cyrus for expressing her sexuality when performing on stage in 2013, as well as attacking Beyonce for showing showing too much skin in a 2014 music video.\n\n'I regret all the mistakes I made. I call myself a feminist-in-training,' Jameela admitted.\n\n'Stuff I said when I was younger \u2014 I didn\u2019t really have all the answers yet. I hadn\u2019t had therapy yet. I didn\u2019t know who I was actually angry at.'\n\nJameela has found motivation in calling out body shaming whenever she sees it.\n\nShe launched her I Weigh Instagram page last year to inspire people to celebrate what makes up their bodies outside of weight.\n\nThe actress has also worked with a number of organizations, such as Aerie, to promote body positivity for people of all sizes.\n\nThe desire to take on this cause stemmed from her own work in the industry, Jameela said.", "description": "Jameela Jamil has reignited her online spat with Victoria Secret model Sara\u00a0Sampaio after they clashed on Twitter over the pitfalls of the modelling industry earlier in the day.", "authors": ["Charlotte Dean For Mailonline", "Brian Gallagher For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/18/19798658-0-image-a-25_1571246186673.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
