REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo\n\nLast month British lawmakers passed legislation, known as the \u201cBenn Act\u201d, which requires Johnson to send a letter to the EU asking for a delay if no divorce agreement has been struck by Oct. 19, to stop what opponents say would be calamitous no-deal Brexit.\n\nWith the clock ticking down to Britain\u2019s due departure on Oct. 31, however, Johnson has consistently said he would not ask for a delay and that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than seek any further extension.\n\nBut he has also said he would not break the law, which he has dubbed \u201cthe surrender act\u201d, without explaining that apparent contradiction.\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigners, who believe Johnson will use a legal loophole or send a second letter, threatening to sabotage EU processes if they grant a Brexit delay, asked Scotland\u2019s Outer House of the Court of Session to issue an order compelling him to comply with the Benn Act.\n\n\u201cThe government accepts that in executing its political policy it must comply with the 2019 Act,\u201d the judge, Paul Cullen, said in his ruling rejecting their challenge.\n\n\u201cThere can be no doubt that (Johnson) now accepts that he must comply with the requirements of the 2019 Act and has affirmed that he intends to do so.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the court heard that the Advocate General, the government\u2019s top legal officer in Scotland, had given assurances that Johnson would fully comply with the Benn Act, the first time the government had publicly acknowledged that Johnson would be required to ask for a Brexit delay.\n\nCullen said the Advocate General had stated \u201cclearly and unequivocally the prime minister\u2019s intention to comply with his statutory duties\u201d with \u201cdetailed and specific\u201d legal declarations.\n\n\u201cThe content of the duty imposed on the prime minister and the circumstances in which he becomes liable to fulfil that duty are carefully and precisely spelled out,\u201d said the judge, who added that \u201cextra-judicial\u201d remarks could not be taken as \u201cconclusive statements of the government\u2019s understanding of its legal obligations\u201d.\n\nLawyer Jo Maugham, one of the campaigners who sought the order, said they expected Scotland\u2019s highest court to hear their appeal on Tuesday.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office had no comment, but before the verdict was given he said: \u201cWe will study any judgments very closely as we always do. We will respect the law and we will leave the European Union on Oct. 31.\u201d", "description": "A Scottish court on Monday rejected a legal bid to force Boris Johnson to ask for a Brexit delay if he has not struck a deal with the European Union in less than two weeks' time, saying the British Prime Minister had given assurances he would do so.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438134627&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960SO", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
