He said the probe will connect the dots between the start of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the current impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\nMARC THIESSEN: NOTHING WRONG WITH TRUMP ASKING FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO HELP INVESTIGATE MUELLER PROBE ORIGINS\n\n\u201cThey are worried, they\u2019re trying to discredit, and they\u2019re suggesting that somehow this is illegitimate to look at why we even have this investigation,\u201d Whitaker told Fox News\u2019s host Laura Ingraham. \u201cA lot of the American people know there\u2019s really no explanation to how a Carter Paige FISA turned into a criminal investigation of the president.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times published an article Sunday criticizing Barr, and the federal prosecutor he appointed to carry out the Russia inquiry, John H. Durham, for traveling to Europe to question diplomats and foreign intelligence officials.\n\nAccording to the Times, Trump\u2019s made the controversial July 25 phone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky as part of his efforts to support Barr\u2019s review of the Russia inquiry. Trump is under fire after a whistleblower\u2019s complaint revealed, on the call, he encouraged Zelensky to investigate Democratic 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden and his family\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nWhitaker said The Times and other media use the term \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d to discredit legitimate concerns about what forces--whether foreign powers or Trump\u2019s political enemies at home--initiated the Russia inquiry conducted by Mueller. Mueller testified before Congress in July that Trump and his associates did not conspire with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe left has been unified throughout the last three years to have everybody singing from the same headline. You watch the 24-hour news cycle and you see they sent out the same talking points to everybody,\u201d Whitaker said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hear anything out now about the Mueller investigation as a basis for this impeachment inquiry. It\u2019s all about Ukraine,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt came on before they even had the transcript, before they had the whistleblower complaint. Now they\u2019ve realized the deficiencies in the complaint, so they\u2019ve got a second whistleblower that they don\u2019t want to put in front of the American people.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nWhitaker also took aim at Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for reading a parody version of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint before Congress. After Mueller released his 448-page report of the findings of his investigation in April, Democrats in Congress interpreted the report, saying it revealed Trump had colluded with Russia to win the presidency. It wasn\u2019t until Mueller testified before Congress in July that he was able to clarify the findings in the report.\n\n\u201cI have never seen a member of Congress paraphrase a document and distort completely making it look nefarious when really the American people can see with their own eyes what happened on that phone call,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we need sort of people to bring it to life. Last time they had an individual bring it to life\u2026 Mueller\u2026 it completely blew up in their face. I can only imagine now when they have these sort of interpretive recitations of transcripts and of whistleblowers what this could turn in to.\u201d", "description": "Former Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker on Monday took aim at the leftist media for going out of its way to discredit Attorney General Bill Barr\u2019s review into the origins of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/01/Matthew-Whitaker-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
