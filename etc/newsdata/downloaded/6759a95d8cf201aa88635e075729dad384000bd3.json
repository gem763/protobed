Armstrong quickly recounted back.\n\nLegends: Billie Eilish and Billie Joe Armstrong are coming together for an interview for Rolling Stone 's first-ever musicians on musicians issue.\n\nBut while she admired his music, Eilish had some questions, querying: 'Hey, I don't even know how to ask this, but what gave you the urge to, like, moon the audience, or kick people in the head and stuff?'\n\nArmstrong replied: 'I think someone was getting kind of aggro, and then we started having a back-and-forth yelling at each other. And then I was literally fighting with someone in the crowd. I wouldn't recommend it. Please don't do it.'\n\nEilish called the concert-goers that she draws in a 'different type of crowd.'\n\nArmstrong agreed: 'I saw your show. It\u2019s the same energy. It was such a good show. Everybody was singing along; it was like going to a football game in England. But they were singing along to dark stuff. It was almost like being in a cathedral.'\n\nDespite the 30-year age gap, the two bonded over touring, with Bad Guy singer Eilish admitting: '[My next album] haunts me. There was a period where I was like, \"Do I even enjoy music?\" It just felt like so much touring. And I don't mean the shows. The shows are always my favorite part.\n\nOpening up: Billie opened up about not really knowing if she actually enjoyed being a musician during her interview\n\n'But it was just traveling and being alone all the time, on a cold bus in Europe, horrible food, and when you come back, everyone's kind of moved on from you. This last tour I went on was the first I've ever enjoyed. I feel like I have this amazing thing that now I actually see.'\n\nArmstrong, revealed he's a fan of the younger Billie.\n\n'I know this sounds [weird], but I always gravitate toward music that sounds like freedom. And that's what I get from your music. It's like an earnest person that's expressing themselves and incorporating new sounds. Some of it sounds like jazz to me, if that's cool to say?,' he said to her.\n\n'The lyrics are also just very real. That's important when you're surrounded by things that sound synthetic and not very real.'\n\n\n\n", "description": "She wasn't even born when he found fame as the lead guitarist for the iconic 90s band Green Day.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20333408-0-image-a-26_1572364058483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
