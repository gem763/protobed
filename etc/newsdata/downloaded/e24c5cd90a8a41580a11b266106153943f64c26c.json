You are the chaperone at the high school dance, the seat-belt nanny on the roller coaster, the diet option on the menu at the Cheesecake Factory. No one likes you, and it shows.\n\nSo why do they keep at it? Well, because it\u2019s even less fun being the mayor of someplace such as Chicago.\n\nLori Lightfoot (D), Chicago\u2019s new mayor, is a historic figure \u2014 the first black woman to run one of the United States\u2019 biggest cities. She took office in May and just this week gave her first \u201cState of the City\u201d address. Yet the coverage of that address focused not on the historic moment, but on the $838 million deficit she forecast for the coming year. This in the middle of a long economic boom during which Chicago property values have increased, often dramatically, and young, affluent people have flooded the city. Throw in a recession sometime in the next couple of years, and Chicago is going to be in a full-blown crisis.\n\nThis situation obviously can\u2019t be blamed on a mayor who has been in office for only a few months. But it\u2019s not even exactly the fault of Rahm Emanuel (D), her predecessor, who worked hard to stabilize what used to be an even more dire financial situation. Rather, it\u2019s the fault of generations of politicians before them who promised an ever-richer array of benefits to government workers. Particularly, they liked to raise the retirement benefits.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with paying generous pensions, if that\u2019s how workers prefer to take their compensation. But that sort of compensation is actually quite expensive. To fund even a modest guaranteed pension benefit decades in the future, you have to invest a big chunk of money in assets right now. Over time, those assets will grow and generate the cash to pay out the benefits you\u2019ve promised \u2014\n\nOh, ho, ho, ho. Pay for the pensions? No, we have to stop; some politician might be reading this, and they could really hurt themselves laughing too hard. The whole point of giving workers pension benefits instead of cash was that you didn\u2019t have to pay for them; you could promise the benefits now and gather up the votes that the grateful workers tossed at your feet, all without costing current taxpayers a single dime.\n\nFuture taxpayers, you say? This is why no one likes budget scolds. Future taxpayers mostly weren\u2019t voting in 1982 municipal elections. Besides, they\u2019d probably all be so rich from their flying cars that they wouldn\u2019t miss a little extra pension money. And if not? Well, that was a problem for later, when the politicians would be out of office.\n\nChicagoans, welcome to \u201clater.\u201d The municipal pensions only have about 25 percent of the assets they\u2019ll need to cover projected benefits, a shortfall of roughly $28 billion. And that\u2019s according to the city\u2019s rather optimistic estimates. If you use a more cautious method, you come up with a shortfall of more than $40 billion . This is one reason that Moody\u2019s Investors Service rates the city\u2019s general obligation debt as junk bonds.\n\nIt has been obvious for decades what was going to happen to Chicago and also obvious what would have to be done about it: some combination of pension trims, spending cuts and tax increases. But that\u2019s budget-scold math. The political arithmetic was much simpler: Everyone thought that 100 percent of the cost of adjustment ought to be borne by someone else.\n\nAnd so, Chicago politicians kept opting for \u201clater\u201d whenever possible, turning to a series of one-time tricks to cover shortfalls. With each delay, the problem got worse as they borrowed even more money from the future to keep taxpayers and workers happy.\n\nCompound interest is your friend when you\u2019re saving and your mortal enemy when you\u2019re borrowing. Every day you delay the reckoning means that tomorrow, you\u2019ll have to run even farther just to stay in place. Chicago is now approaching the point where the growth of its obligations will outpace the growth of any possible revenue stream it might use to cover them. It\u2019s a few steps from there to municipal bankruptcy.\n\nOf course, Chicago politicians aren\u2019t the first ones to say \u201clater\u201d; they certainly won\u2019t be the last. In fact, we\u2019re all saying it right now, except for those tiresome budget scolds.\n\nThe United States, like Chicago, hasn\u2019t run a budget surplus since 2002. We\u2019re headed for a deficit of nearly $1 trillion in a boom economy \u2014 thanks to Democrats who refuse to cut spending, Republicans who refuse to raise taxes and an electorate that seems curiously unworried about the increasingly parlous finances of Medicare and Social Security.\n\nNo, Chicago politicians are only the most vivid current example of where we\u2019ll all eventually end up when \u201clater\u201d becomes \u201cnow.\u201d And when we get there, we\u2019ll probably wish we\u2019d listened to the budget hawks a little sooner.\n\nRead more from Megan McArdle\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.", "description": "The city\u2019s huge deficits could become a crisis should a recession materialize.", "authors": ["Megan Mcardle", "Megan Mcardle Is A Washington Post Columnist", "The Author Of"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QKT69_Vyuz0FrvP8BZh_s6K997M=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BIWIIIWLMII6TIP6ZJDORVLTYA.jpg"}
