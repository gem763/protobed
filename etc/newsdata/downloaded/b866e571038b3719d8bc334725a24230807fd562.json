Officers remain at the scene. Inquiries continue.\u201d\n\nPolice used a battering ram to break into the building, the former Lambeth county court, after activists locked themselves inside.\n\nDamien Gayle (@damiengayle) Police use a battering ram to break into #ExtinctionRebellion warehouse in Kennington, south London pic.twitter.com/szb98zlZgP\n\nCaroline Vincent, who works in police liaison for Extinction Rebellion, said: \u201cPolice don\u2019t want us to move equipment out which is considered infrastructure because they think it\u2019s going to be used to commit a crime, and the crime is blocking the highway.\n\n\u201cSo pita and pans are considered to be equipment that will be used to commit a crime; cushions too, apparently. The only things we are allowed to move away are first aid kits, milk and fliers.\u201d\n\nActivists said they were concerned at the police decision to act pre-emptively against them.\n\nRichard Ecclestone, a former police officer who has joined the group, said: \u201cThese tactics are very questionable and are arguably infringing on our rights to peaceful protest, and indeed our efforts to preserve people\u2019s right to life that is currently being jeopardised by the government failing to act on the climate and ecological emergency that they know exists.\u201d\n\nXR said confiscated equipment included portable toilets, kitchen equipment, gazebos and big tents, cooking urns and big thermos flasks, 250-watt solar panels and 12v car batteries, food, waterproofs, umbrellas and hot water bottles.\n\nThe group said in a statement: \u201cThis escalation of pre-emptive tactics by the government and police is a sign that we are being heard and acknowledged as a significant movement. We ask that the government focus their attention and resources on responding to the climate and ecological emergency which threatens us all.\u201d", "description": "Officers raid building used by climate activists to store items for Westminster rally", "authors": ["Damien Gayle", "Lisa Nandy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efc881f8ad99a996c2f3e2d5e3f97125f354cff8/0_32_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=220a848730c19e44fab41edd2c3823a7", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
