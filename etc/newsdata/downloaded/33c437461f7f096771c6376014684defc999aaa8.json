Photo: Courtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nBecause the world of beard-care products is so vast, it can be difficult to know what is essential to the health and appearance of your beard, and what will sit unused in the back corner of your medicine cabinet. One thing\u2019s for sure, nobody likes a dry beard \u2014 not your significant other, not your barber, not the front of your dark sweaters, and certainly not the skin that\u2019s languishing under all that brittle scruff.\n\nJust like the hair on your head, your facial hair needs to be properly moisturized. If things get really bad, you could even develop flakes of beardruff. But there\u2019s always hope \u2014 and help, in the form of conditioners, beard balms, and beard oils. We\u2019ve already written about the best beard oils, so here we\u2019re concentrating on the best balms and conditioners, and how and when to use them. We talked to ten beard experts to learn about the products they regularly use at work and at home.\n\nBest overall beard balm\n\nScotch Porter All-Natural Men's Beard Balm Beard balms generally do three things: add moisture, soften hairs, and prevent any stray beard hairs from springing out of formation. Depending on the texture of your beard and how much hold you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019ll want to choose either a waxy balm or a buttery balm. The more unruly your beard, the more stiff and waxy the product you want. Three of the experts we spoke to, Pedro Rosario, director of hair-care operations at the barber-on-demand app Shortcut, master barber Torrey Grobes of Paul Labrecque Salon and Spa, and Madeline Ferrer, senior merchant at Birchbox Grooming, recommend Scotch Porter beard balm for its all-natural ingredients and ability to soften coarse beard hairs. It has a base of highly nourishing shea butter and coconut oil, heavy-hitting moisturizers like Argan and Jojoba oil, and a mix of botanicals, including Marshmallow Root, Slippery Elm Bark, Burdock Root, Nettle Leaf, Neem Leaf, Rosemary Leaf, and Chamomile Flowers. Rosario is a fan of the entire Scotch Porter grooming line. It\u2019s \u201cgeared toward coarse hair and above and beyond anything I have ever used,\u201d he says. Ferrer, who included Scotch Porter beard balm in Birchbox\u2019s new men\u2019s grooming box says \u201cWe sampled this to our (bearded) subscribers for the first time earlier this year and they loved it. It\u2019s free of chemicals and leaves beards soft and shiny while keeping dandruff away.\u201d $38 at Amazon Buy $38 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) overall beard balm\n\nHonest Amish Beard Balm Leave-in Conditioner Two of our experts \u2014 Grobes and Annette Moore, the owner of BoldBarber.com \u2014 recommend Honest Amish beard balm, which, like Scotch Porter, is made using all-natural ingredients. The Shea and cocoa butter base are mixed with argan, avocado, almond, and apricot kernel essential oils to create a super-nourishing and hydrating balm. \u201cA little goes a long way,\u201d Moore says. \u201cIt\u2019s great at taming beards, softening facial hair, and adding a nice shine.\u201d $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest beard balm for styling\n\nWahl Beard Balm for Grooming, Polishing & Styling Richie Joumant, owner of Sterling Barbershop in Amboy, Illinois, uses Wahl beard balm on all of his bearded clients. Like the Scotch Porter and Honest Amish, it\u2019s paraben-free and includes shea butter and nourishing apricot kernel oil. Unlike those brands, the Wahl balm also contains beeswax, which makes it better for unruly beards, Manuka oil, which is good for fighting dandruff, and clove oil, which is antiseptic and therefore good for ingrown hairs and acne. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest beard balm for taming frizz\n\nBabe of Brooklyn Biker's Brew Cassidy Theall, a barber at Fellow Barber\u2019s Seaport location in New York, is a fan of this balm, which has a beeswax base, making it more of a beard pomade. According to Cassidy, \u201cit can be used on any length of beard and on any hair type.\u201d She likes that it\u2019s thick enough to help tame frizz. But because it melts down to a liquid consistency when rubbed in your hands, it applies to facial hair with ease. Biker\u2019s Brew also contains mango seed butter, cocoa seed butter, and vitamin E, all effective moisturizers that are light enough not to ruin your pillowcase. $35 at Babe of Brooklyn Buy\n\nBest non-greasy beard balm\n\nBulldog Skincare and Grooming For Men Original Beard Balm Bulldog Beard Balm is a favorite of Eliut Rivera, founder of Eliut Salon. \u201cI really love the texture of this product,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like a mix between a moisturizer and beard oil, and it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy look.\u201d That light and easy texture is thanks to Bulldog\u2019s first ingredient: water. It also contains Shea butter, Cocoa butter, sweet almond oil \u2014 one of the lightest carrier oils, Rivera says \u2014 aloe vera, and green tea. Bulldog won\u2019t do much for shaping or styling your beard, but it will moisturize the hairs without clogging your pores. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest beard balm for new beards\n\nProraso Single Blade Beard Balm Michael Haar, owner of Haar & Co. barbershop in New York, swears by Proraso products because of the brand\u2019s long history and respected reputation in the men\u2019s grooming world. He recommends this for men with short beards or those who are in the first few weeks of growing a beard because it relieves any itchy discomfort related to new hair growth. Haar suggests using a dime or nickel-sized amount daily. Apply it \u201clike you would with a moisturizer, but focusing on your beard,\u201d he says. To fully distribute this \u201clotionlike\u201d balm he\u2019ll go over the beard with several strokes of a boar-bristle brush after applying. Among its key ingredients are Eucalyptus oil and menthol, which are both astringent and will help prevent ingrown hairs. And if you\u2019re wondering, Haar prefers the Wood and Spice scent for fall and winter. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest rinse-out beard conditioner\n\nViking Revolution Beard Conditioner Beard conditioners are similar to balms, only they penetrate the hair follicle more deeply, leaving less of a residue. And they aren\u2019t typically used for styling. Like conditioner for the hair on your head, they help soften and repair dry facial hair while locking in moisture for a healthier appearance.\n\nRivera recommends first washing your beard in the shower, then applying beard conditioner. Don\u2019t rinse it out right away. It\u2019ll work better if you leave it on your facial hair for around five minutes while continuing your normal shower routine, he says. Moore likes this conditioner from Viking Revolution because \u201cleaves beards extra smooth and soft.\u201d Along with argan, Jojoba, and apricot kernel oils, it contains hydrolyzed yeast protein to strengthen each hair follicle and help repair split ends. $19 at Amazon Buy $19 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest leave-in beard conditioner\n\nBest hair conditioner to use on beards\n\nMalin and Goetz Cilantro Hair Conditioner. Several of our experts said that you could use the same conditioner on your beard that you do for your hair. It\u2019s a point of personal preference \u2014 and your willingness to spend money. Rosario says, \u201cI encourage frugal men to use the same conditioner for both.\u201d Joseph Rosenfeld, a New York\u2013based personal stylist (and proud sporter of a beard of his own), agrees: \u201cIf I can find one product that does double duty, I\u2019ll use it,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the days when I condition my hair, I use what remains on my hands after treating my hair and scalp to do the same with my beard. It works like a charm.\u201d Rosenfeld credits the fatty acids present in Malin and Goetz\u2019s Cilantro conditioner with helping to keep his look on point without any oily residue. The cilantro extract has a calming effect on the skin, and the Shea butter, sunflower seed oil, and coriander seed oil help lock in moisture. $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
