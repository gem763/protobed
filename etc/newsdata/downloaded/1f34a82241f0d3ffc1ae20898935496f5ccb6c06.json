Saudi leads a military coalition against the Iran-backed Huthis, which have carried out dozens of cross-border drone and missile attacks on Saudi targets, including oil facilities.\n\nWashington has concluded that the strikes were launched from Iranian soil and that cruise missiles were used. Tehran denies its involvement.\n\nOPEC also once again trimmed its forecast for the growth in global oil demand, to 0.98 mbd from 1.02 mbd, although that was due to downward revisions to demand in the first half of the year.\n\nAlso revised lower was demand for petrol and diesel in the United States.\n\nThe cartel held its forecast for demand growth next year steady at 1.08 mbd.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 The OPEC oil cartel saw its crude production fall in September, mostly due to production falling in Saudi Arabia following attacks on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/e06a3a_attacks-on-saudi-oil-installations-caused-sharp-but-short-lived-drop-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
