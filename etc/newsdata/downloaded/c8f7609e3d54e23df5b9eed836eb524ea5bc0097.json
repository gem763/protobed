This will leave only 3 million more to mine. With the Bitcoin halving approaching quickly, it\u2019s perhaps time to appreciate one of the most predominant qualities of Bitcoin, namely, its digital scarcity.\n\n18 Millionth Bitcoin Mined\n\nBitcoin\u2019s history begins a little over 10 years ago. For that short period of time, it\u2019s close to reaching more than 85% of its total supply. Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of the protocol, has hardwired it so that no more than 21 million bitcoins to ever be \u201ccreated.\u201d Of course, this could be changed if the majority of the network participants representing 51% of the hashrate, unanimously decide to do so. Looking at its rather distributed nature, however, at this time the odds of this are slim at best.\n\nAfter today, only 3,000,000 bitcoins will be left mine. However, because of the regular halving events and the increasing difficulty, it\u2019s estimated that this will take quite some time and that Bitcoin\u2019s entire supply will be mined in the distant 2140.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For Bitcoin?\n\nThe closest event which is directly related to mining is the 2020 Bitcoin halving. At the current hashrate, it should take place in May next year. This will slash the rewards that miners get for adding new blocks to the network in half.\n\nBasically, instead of the 12.5BTC block rewards that miners get, they will begin receiving 6.25BTC. This will reduce the overall supply of Bitcoin on the market in half. Currently, 1,800 bitcoins are mined every single day and this number will drop down to 900. In addition, this will also cause a reduction in Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate from the current 3.72% to 1.8%.\n\nNaturally, as the supply of freshly minted bitcoins on the market is reduced, if the demand for them remains the same or increases, its price should increase. This is something that a lot of industry proponents are looking forward to and, historically, it has always happened.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Digital Scarcity\n\nOne of the things that make Bitcoin stand up among other digital products is its scarcity. It has a finite supply that is predetermined and everyone\u2019s aware of it, unlike gold. While gold is also scarce, the remaining amount that we can mine is based on estimates and research. With Bitcoin, we know how many will ever be in circulation \u2013 21 million.\n\nThere is a lot that stems from this fact. First and foremost, no one but the network participants themselves has the capability to \u201cprint\u201d new bitcoins in order to control inflation. Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate is also pre-determined and it\u2019s reduced only as the supply goes down \u2013 after the halving events.\n\nAnother thing that should be considered, and perhaps what people are interested in the most, is the implication that scarcity has on value. The scarcer an object in demand is, the more valuable it becomes. Imagine that there were only 100 tons of gold on the earth and gold still served the purposes it does today. Its price would certainly have been different.\n\nIn any case, to commemorate this event and to unite the community under the same umbrella, popular Bitcoin proponent, Anthony \u201cPomp\u201d Pompliano has started a hashtag on Twitter: #3MillionLeft and it already has hundreds of people using it.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "At the current rate, we can expect the 18 millionth Bitcoin to be mined.
