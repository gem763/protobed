One positive outcome from having recurrent cancer was that it taught me to let go of the insignificant things and to just enjoy the people and places. After three recurrences, my body finally had enough and I passed away on Sunday, September 22, 2019, at the Cleveland Clinic.\u201d\n\nApproximately 13,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with laryngeal cancer each year. Risk factors include smoking or using tobacco products, drinking large amounts of alcohol, age, gender, personal history of head and neck cancer and occupations, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nSymptoms typically include a sore throat or cough that does not go away, a change in voice, pain or trouble swallowing, ear pain, a lump in the neck or throat, problems producing vocal sounds, trouble breathing, high-pitched breathing, feeling like something is in the throat, or coughing up blood. It\u2019s typically treated with radiation, chemotherapy and surgery.\n\nRHODE ISLAND MOM WHO LOST SON, 1, TO CANCER ASKING FOR HALLOWEEN-THEMED ROCKS FOR BOY'S GRAVE\n\nKuzma, who noted that she was a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh and had received her Master of Education degree from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, wrote that she decided to write her own obituary \u201cpreceding her passing as part of the many preparations to make the transition easier on her family.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old also wrote that she enjoyed spending time with her cats, reading, wine tasting, watching movies, boating, watching the Steelers and seeing sunsets. She also noted her travels to various places and how she traveled to Mexico to see Chichen Itza after she found out about her latest recurrence.\n\n\u201cI am extremely grateful for the life that I lived,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was fortunate to have a loving family, supportive friends, a stable and meaningful job, and a house to call my own. My wish for you is to stop letting insignificant situations stress you out. Do what is important to you. Relax and enjoy the company of those around you. What do you value in your life? In the end, that\u2019s what matters.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKuzma also noted that she thinks traditional wakes and funeral viewings are \u201ctoo sad\u201d and instead asked her family to host \u201ca celebration of my life,\u201d which will take place on Oct. 13.", "description": "\u201cI am extremely grateful for the life that I lived,\u201d she wrote.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Ashley-Ann-Kuzma1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
