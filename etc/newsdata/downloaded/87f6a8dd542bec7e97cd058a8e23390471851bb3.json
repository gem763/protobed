Both came to Washington with no previous political experience. When Mr. Smith uncovers graft on the part of the senior senator from his state, the political machinery revs up against him full-bore. Shining a lantern on political corruption, Mr. Smith is himself accused of corrupt dealing\u2014sound familiar?\u2014by critics who say Mr. Smith\u2019s legislation to start a boys\u2019 camp will line the senator\u2019s own pockets. The allegation is false, but that doesn\u2019t stop a throng of senators from hastily calling for Mr. Smith\u2019s expulsion from the Senate. Nancy Pelosi may want to view Capra\u2019s film again to see how well that worked out.\n\nMr. Trump is a born disrupter. Mr. Smith has disrupter status thrust upon him but comes to relish it no less. Mr. Trump rails endlessly about the press\u2019s distortion of his record. When Mr. Smith\u2019s young Boy Rangers ride bicycles to his rescue, their newspapers\u2014the only ones not on the payroll of corrupt tycoons and politicians\u2014are confiscated. The radio stations are also all on the take. The media controls the narrative; the public is kept in the dark.\n\nReminiscent of Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent \u201cI\u2019m not a politician\u201d disclaimer, an all but broken, filibuster-weary Jefferson Smith acknowledges his outsider status to his fellow senators in a climactic scene: \u201cA guy like me should never be allowed to get in here in the first place.\u201d But he was. And despite all efforts to stop him, so was Mr. Trump.", "description": "", "authors": ["Gregg Opelka", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
