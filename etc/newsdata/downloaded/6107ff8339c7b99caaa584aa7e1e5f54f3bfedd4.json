The guidelines do stress that it's not just going to happen willy nilly, but is specifically related to the solicitation guidelines.\n\nThe updated standards have been in place since August but were only recently clocked by XBiz.\n\nA spokesperson responded to the site's question about its apparent clampdown on sex workers, but they maintained that \"nothing changed in terms of the policy itself or how we enforce it, we simply updated the language to make it clearer for our community.\u201d\n\nSo keep using those aubergines, peaches, and cats, and let us know how you get on.
