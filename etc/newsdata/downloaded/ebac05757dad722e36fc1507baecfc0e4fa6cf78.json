I really just wanted to thank this newspaper for its work and continued support for the People\u2019s Vote movement. Hopefully you will get a wonderful write up in the history books.\n\nOur little group are all 60-plus, proud Europeans and British.\n\nWe want a vote about our future which is based on unquestionable facts.\n\nJoan Martin\n\nLeighton Buzzard\n\nRefugees are human beings in need\n\nThe European parliament\u2019s vote against improving rescue and search for refugees in the Mediterranean is a grim reminder of the moral depravity it has sunk into.\n\nRefugees are not wallowing for pity, waiting for handouts. They are not mere statistics. They are men, women and children who have been compelled to flee their home countries in search of safety and have known nothing but war, poverty, trauma, displacement and devastation.\n\nI just wonder what would happen if European countries received a quarter of what countries like Jordan or Lebanon had where one in seven is a refugee and where 90 per cent of refugees reside within host communities with enormous strains on public resources, infrastructures and social and health services.\n\nDr Munjed Farid Al Qutob\u200b\n\nLondon NW2\n\nBig oil interests\n\nThe US is going to bolster its military presence in northeastern Syria to deny Isis \u201cand others\u201d (ie the Assad government) access to the oil fields there. Trump has boasted about holding the oil fields and talked about sending in US companies to take them over. Those oil fields belong to Syria, whose people are food insecure and desperately need to start the work of reconstruction in their country.\n\nThe US army should leave Syria now, and the severe sanctions enforced by the US and EU should end.\n\nBrendan O\u2019Brien\n\nLondon N21\n\nThey are just like us\n\nHow refreshing it was to read David Lowndes\u2019 letter (Only a Final Say can heal our terrible division). I was, however, horrified by the results of the survey about \u201cthe price worth paying\u201d which suggested a staggering number of leave and remain voters would be willing to accept acts of violence against politicians and the collateral injuries to members of the public from violent mass protests.\n\nThis takes us to a level I never thought I would hear in our supposedly tolerant country.\n\nI would just like to remind everyone that politicians are only ordinary human beings, with families, the same as the rest of us. Most are hard-working and well-intentioned and deserve our thanks for their continued efforts to find a way through this awful mess, whilst not allowing themselves to be bullied by this truly awful government. We need them.\n\nHazel Pratt\n\nLeamington Spa\n\nA defence of those who were here first\n\nI refer to your report by Phoebe Weston regarding invasive species.\n\nI am getting tired of the same old rhetoric being trotted out about grey squirrels (and indeed the Muntjac deer) in particular. If people were bothered to find out facts other than those constantly being peddled by so-called red squirrel lovers, they would find that the grey squirrel has been in the UK for over 150 years (as has the Muntjac deer) yet is considered invasive.\n\nThey would understand that red squirrels were culled almost to extinction until the 1950s by farmers who were paid a penny a tail. They would see that the red squirrel\u2019s habitat is rare at best in the UK, and non-existent across much of it. They would also find out that the majority of red squirrels we have now are introduced from Scandinavia (a bit of a man-made neo-invasion wouldn\u2019t you say). They would have to consider that a major source of squirrel pox is red squirrel feeding stations \u2013 man-made areas which are a haven for dirt and disease. Oh, and they must not forget that red squirrels are also rodents so they have the same habits as other rodentia (including the grey squirrel). And they would have a lot less trees if it weren\u2019t for the grey squirrel because of their food habits.\n\nPresumably, climate change has absolutely nothing to do with human activity and therefore it\u2019s a lot easier to vilify these \u201cinvaders\u201d than to actually address the problems that climate change is bringing upon the world in the first place. And I fail to understand how creatures, such as the rabbit and pheasant, that have been here since Roman times can be classed as invasive anyway. I think you\u2019ll find that humans have inflicted infinitely greater harm on the world than these animals could ever achieve.\n\nPerhaps a bit more balanced, logical and, dare I say, kinder thinking is in order. There is always more than one side to any story if someone is willing enough to look.\n\nTracy Battensby\u200b\n\nNorth Yorkshire", "description": "The \u201cLiberal Democrats\u201d\u00a0wish to nullify the democratic result of the 2016 referendum: to \u201cairbrush\u201d the result out of history.\u00a0 \u00a0 In proposing this, the \u201cLiberal Democrats\u201d\u00a0do not simply contest the Brexit struggle to recover national sovereignty and home-rule; they wish to crush democracy itself, because it fails to deliver their cause.\u00a0 If this doesn\u2019t take us to the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/15/jo-swinson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
