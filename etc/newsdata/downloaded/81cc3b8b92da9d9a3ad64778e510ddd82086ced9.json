While only one in four veterans, overall, said they had a job lined up after discharge, about half of post-9/11 veterans found a job less than six months after starting their search.\n\nRegardless of when they started looking, 57 percent of post-9/11 veterans said it took less than six months to find a job. Another 21 percent said they found employment within a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s more, 61 percent of post-9/11 veterans said serving in the military helped them get their first job after leaving, including 35 percent who felt it helped \u201ca lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat it means to be a military veteran in the United States is being shaped by a new generation of service members,\u201d according to the report. About one in five veterans today served on active duty after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, in which terrorists toppled the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York and flew an airline into the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cTheir collective experiences \u2014 from deployment to combat to the transition back to civilian life \u2014 are markedly different from those who served in previous eras,\" the report found.\n\nThe differences are not all good.\n\nVeterans, overall, who\u2019ve had traumatic or distressing experiences while in the military, and those who\u2019ve experienced post-traumatic stress, were more likely than those who didn\u2019t share such experiences to face financial difficulties after returning to civilian life.\n\nFor example, 61 percent of veterans who experienced post-traumatic stress said they \u201chad trouble paying bills in the first few years after they left the military,\u201d Pew noted. That\u2019s compared with 30 percent who haven't had post-traumatic stress.\n\nAnd post-9/11 veterans were more likely than pre-9/11 veterans to say that readjusting was difficult. About half of post-9/11 veterans say it was somewhat or very difficult to readjust, compared with one in five veterans whose service ended before.\n\nPost-9/11 veterans were also more likely to have been deployed, seen combat or experienced emotional trauma, the data showed. Roughly three-quarters of post-9/11 veterans were deployed at least once, compared with 58 percent of those who served before them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The Pew Research Center conducted a study of nearly 1,300 veterans to gauge their feelings about money.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
