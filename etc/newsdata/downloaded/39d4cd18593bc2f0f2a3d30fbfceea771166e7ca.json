The EU has drawn up a plan for countermeasures worth $12 billion.\n\n\u201cThis step leaves us no alternative but to follow through in due course with our own tariffs in the Boeing case, where the U.S. has been found in breach of WTO rules,\u201d Malmstrom said in an emailed statement on Friday in Brussels.\n\nEurope has been gearing up for an escalation of the 15-year-old fight over aircraft subsidies while warning the Trump administration against resorting to tariffs and urging it to seek a negotiated solution.\n\n\u201cThe EU and the U.S. have a joint responsibility to sit down and negotiate a settlement that is balanced and compliant with the WTO,\u201d Malmstrom said on Friday. \u201cImposing tariffs on each other serves nobody\u2019s long-term interest. It will inflict very significant damage to the highly integrated supply chain of the aircraft sectors in the U.S. and the EU and will result in collateral damage to many other sectors already suffering under the current trade tensions.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan Stearns in Brussels at jstearns2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Richard Bravo, Peter Chapman\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The European Union pledged to impose tit-for-tat tariffs against the U.S. in a longstanding transatlantic dispute over illegal aid to aircraft manufacturers.The renewed vow by European trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom came as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration triggered duties on $7.5", "authors": ["Jonathan Stearns"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ePR8xO3AwTg5XAmXq.6zvg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/a86703249bb38c7b40bd38ac69158971", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
