It is a very dark purple colour near the cut, so it\u2019s not looking pretty BUT I\u2019ve been able to walk all day so I assume it\u2019s not that serious. I\u2019m hoping it will heal on its own.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTerrifying knife accidents aside, the pair seem to be having a blast in Japan, which is where they got engaged back in 2018.\n\nMarzia shared some stunning snaps of the streets of Tokyo, the gorgeous landscape at night, as well as a couple of her new husband.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m enjoying experiencing autumn in Tokyo for the first time\u2026it is much warmer than you would expect!\u2019 she wrote.\n\nShe said it\u2019s not pretty (Picture: Instagram/itsmarziapie)\n\nMeanwhile Pewds \u2013 real name Felix Kjellberg \u2013 showed off his silly side as he got his groove on with a street performer.\n\nHolding a ragged Barbie doll, the YouTuber danced along with a performer who appeared to be creating some sort of illusion as he wore a \u2018wind-swept\u2019 tie.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nLaughter could be heard in the background as Felix slowly danced towards the performer, who dramatically lunged at the doll, which looked a little worse for wear, and embraced it.\n\nThere was a lot to unpack but hey, he seems to be having fun.\n\nIt seems the pair are treating it as a second honeymoon after they tied the knot earlier this year at London\u2019s Kew Gardens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the intimate ceremony (and dropping tons of snaps on their social media), they jetted off to Bali for a spot of sun.\n\nHowever, with Felix hitting 100 million subscribers immediately after the big day and still posting a video every day, he\u2019s made it clear that the hustle never stops.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
