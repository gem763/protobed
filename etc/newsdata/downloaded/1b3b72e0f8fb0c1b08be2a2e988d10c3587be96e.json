(Photo: Gizmodo)\n\nSince Apple introduced its butterfly keyboard design in 2015, the problems with it have been very well documented \u2014 and they\u2019re problems that I\u2019ve experienced as well, with a 2018 MacBook Pro (the one with the third revision of butterfly keyboard, if you\u2019re keeping count). If yours is also acting up, here\u2019s what you can do.\n\nYou\u2019ll find a long list of stories on the web, so here\u2019s mine, briefly. A few months after buying the MacBook Pro, certain keys would start repeating themselves \u2014 the \u201co\u201d and the \u201ci\u201d key are particularly susceptible to this, though reading through other online complaints it seems that any key can fall victim to the problem.\n\nNot long after that, the space bar started acting up as well \u2014 now I only get what I expect (a space) around three-quarters of the time. For the other 25 per cent of hits a myriad of things happen that shouldn\u2019t. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t register a tap at all, sometimes it registers two taps, and sometimes it goes really crazy and responds with a space, a period, and a space again.\n\nFor someone who writes for a living, this is hardly ideal \u2014 getting readable sentences together is difficult enough without having to go back and edit half of them again to remove typos introduced by Apple\u2019s low-profile keyboard design.\n\nYou can probably imagine the frustration of reporting on Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 launch with a temperamental space bar and keyboard\u2014transcribing Tim Cook\u2019s talk of making \u201cproducts and technologies that are designed in the service of humanity\u201d is a lot more difficult when you have to go back and add spaces and remove superfluous characters. And I wasn\u2019t the only one.\n\nThank you, Unshaky, for blocking 3,454 phantom presses. (Screenshot: Gizmodo)\n\nSo that\u2019s where we\u2019re up to (and where I\u2019m up to). The butterfly keyboard got a fourth revision this May, and we\u2019re all hoping that Apple has finally fixed the problem, four years down the line \u2014 it seems as though it\u2019s trying yet another material to keep dust and debris out of its keyboards, though it hasn\u2019t said what that material is, or, Apple being Apple, said very much about the issue at all.\n\nThis sort of tale isn\u2019t new \u2014 so if you\u2019re suffering from the same problem, what can you do about it? First of all, I must give a hat tip to 9to5Mac and the incredibly useful (and free) Unshaky app, which tries to identify and block double keypresses in quick succession. If, like me, you\u2019re waiting for the right time to take advantage of the repair program, it might give you a few months of leeway.\n\nUnshaky sits unassumingly in the menu bar going about its business, and you can disable it for certain keys if you\u2019re only having problems with a few of them. The number of accidental (i.e. dodgy keyboard-related) presses it\u2019s managed to block on my MacBook Pro is approaching 3,500, and it\u2019s meant that my laptop has at least been usable while Apple has been deciding how to deal with its keyboard woes.\n\nApple\u2019s own solution to the problem has turned out to be far less effective than Unshaky, at least for me. It suggests blowing some air at the problem, holding up your MacBook at an angle than using a can of compressed air to run down the keyboard from top to bottom and left to right. For best results, keep the can\u2019s straw about half an inch from the keyboard, Apple says.\n\nApple has a guide to how to clean your keyboard. (Image: Apple)\n\nReader, I tried it: It didn\u2019t help. Sentences are still appearing with more Os and Is in them than I need and without enough spaces. It\u2019s possible that my air can technique wasn\u2019t up to par, or the air itself was inferior, but the issue has persisted to this day.\n\nThe good news is that Apple has now decided to replace every keyboard that\u2019s faulty (originally, my third-gen butterfly keyboard model was excluded from the repair program).\n\nThat stretches back to the original 2015 MacBook models and covers everything since, though the program only extends for four years, so you\u2019ll need to act fast if you\u2019ve got one of them (though you may have sorted a fix already anyway).\n\nYou need to head into an Apple Store, or an Apple Authorised Service Provider, to get the keyboard upgraded to the latest fourth-generation model, which we\u2019re assuming isn\u2019t blighted by sticky space bars or repeating letters. Alternatively, you may just get a few of the keys replaced. Check the official support page for full details.\n\nThe deal even covers the 2019 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models, which doesn\u2019t fill us with a huge amount of confidence that Apple thinks it\u2019s made its keyboards robust enough to handle a bit of typing.\n\nI\u2019m hoping that a professional Apple Store repair is going to be enough to get me a MacBook Pro with a keyboard that works \u2014 all I need to do now is clear a couple of days in the diary when I don\u2019t need a laptop.", "description": "Since Apple introduced its butterfly keyboard design in 2015, the problems with it have been very well documented \u2014 and they\u2019re problems that I\u2019ve experienced as well, with a 2018 MacBook Pro (the one with the third revision of butterfly keyboard, if you\u2019re keeping count).
