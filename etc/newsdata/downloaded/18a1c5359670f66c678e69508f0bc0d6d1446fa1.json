Republicans who were present insisted that Volker had not said there was a quid pro quo for dirt on Biden, but you don\u2019t have to take their word for it, because the Democratic chairs of three committees released text messages that Volker turned over.\n\nThe messages make clear that both American and Ukrainian officials understood that there was a quid pro quo: If Zelensky wanted to get a White House visit and military aid, he had to manufacture an investigation into the Bidens. In one message, Volker wrote that \u201cassuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate/\u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\u201d Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland wrote, \u201ci think potus really wants the deliverable.\u201d\n\nIn another exchange, Bill Taylor\u2014a career Foreign Service officer and the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine after the ambassador was fired, reportedly at Giuliani\u2019s behest\u2014wrote, \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Sondland, evidently worried about creating a paper trail, instructed Taylor to call him.\n\nA few days later, Taylor said, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d After taking five hours to reply, Sondland again tried to clean up matters and prevent any written record. \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d Sondland also recommended that Taylor contact the secretary of state if he had other questions, making Mike Pompeo\u2019s involvement in the scheme clear.\n\nBut the stain of scandal is spreading, as a steady drip of evidence shows that Trump has sought to gather dirt on Biden from friends and adversaries alike, across the globe.\n\nDavid A. Graham: What happened in Ukraine?\n\nThursday morning on the White House\u2019s South Lawn, Trump told reporters that China should mount a probe: \u201cThey should investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that\u2019s newly formed\u2014and all these companies\u2014and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d There is no evidence to back up his charges. The moment was breathtaking, because Trump, under threat of impeachment for asking a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election, opted to ask a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election, with cameras rolling.\n\nOnce again, there\u2019s a quid pro quo on the table. China and the U.S. are fighting a trade war and are engaged in tense negotiations about trade policy, giving Beijing every reason to mount a probe to curry favor with Trump. As it turns out, this wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s first request to China to investigate the Bidens. CNN revealed Friday night that in a June call with President Xi Jinping, Trump had brought up Biden. Trump also promised Xi not to bring up pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong during trade negotiations, which explains Trump\u2019s bizarre silence on the demonstrations but spotlights his conciliatory negotiating approach and his lack of commitment to democratic principles.", "description": "When the week began, the president faced questions about Ukraine.
