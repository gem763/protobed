A writeblocker is required to ensure that evidence is not altered during analysis. A unique advantage of Guardonix is that in addition to writeblocking, it also stabilizes the USB connection \u2013 if a storage device is malfunctioning and intermittently goes offline, Guardonix hardware handles the issue, allowing data acquisition to succeed. A number of demo videos are available which describe its inner workings in more detail: https://guardonix.com/blog.html.\n\n\u201cA storage device suffering internal exceptions during imaging can cause workstations to freeze, crash, drop the connection, or work at an unacceptably slow speed, all of which can trap valuable evidence inside a damaged storage device,\u201d says Serge Shirobokov, Sales Director of DeepSpar Data Recovery Systems. \u201cTraditionally, solving these types of issues has always required thousands of dollars of specialized data recovery equipment and hundreds of hours of practical experience, putting the solution out of reach of law enforcement organizations who need it the most. Guardonix is much more accessible, both in terms of its low price point and ease of use, giving many examiners the first viable solution to this problem.\u201d\n\nThe company is now offering digital forensic examiners an opportunity to try out Guardonix for free to confirm their claims first-hand. Applications can be submitted from the following page: https://guardonix.com/demo.html.\n\nThe product recently received a glowing review at DFIR Training where Brett Shavers concluded \u201cGuardonix is now a mandatory part of my DFIR kit. You should seriously consider one for yours too.\u201d Read the full review here: https://www.dfir.training/dfir-training-blog/if-you-don-t-already-have-a-deepspar-guardonix-you-might-want-to-get-one\n\nAbout DeepSpar Data Recovery Systems\n\nDeepSpar is a Canadian company which grew out of a data recovery service provider into a vendor of expert data recovery tools, building field-tested solutions for data recovery professionals since 2004.
