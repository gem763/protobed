They have got to do something more (than bookings). I feel worse it is a young player doing it.\n\n'They are the future and if they are diving now, we have massive trouble now in five or 10 years. We didn't use to accept it. Now we do and I am the only who goes on about it.'\n\nHowever, Chelsea boss Frank Lampard disputed that his player had dived despite the caution.\n\nBurnley boss Dyche says it is 'shambolic' that players aren't sufficiently punished for diving\n\n'If I felt like it was a dive I would address it and speak to Callum but I don't think it as clean cut as that when you are moving into the box at pace and cutting across defenders.'\n\nHe also suggested that Dyche's Burnley aren't angels either.\n\n'There were a lot of things happening today. These things do still happen all over football. Their bench wanted something every time Ashley Barnes fell to the ground.'\n\nHudson-Odoi signed a new five-year contract with Chelsea earlier this season after attracting strong interest from Bayern Munich and was named in England's last under-21 squad.", "description": "Burnley boss Sean Dyche admits he fears for the future of the game after one of English football's most exciting prospects, 18-year-old Chelsea winger Callum", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/20/20224576-0-image-a-14_1572119348477.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
