He needed a conference room to meet high level Italian security agents where he could be sure no one was listening in. And he needed an extra chair for U.S. Attorney John Durham of Connecticut who would be sitting in as his right-hand man.\n\nBarr was in Rome on an under-the-radar mission that was only planned a few days in advance. An official with the embassy confirmed to The Daily Beast that they had to scramble to accommodate Barr\u2019s sudden arrival. He had been in Italy before but not with such a clear motive. Barr and Durham are looking into the events that led to Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, and suddenly all roads were leading to Rome.\n\nThe Daily Beast has learned that Barr and Durham were especially interested in what the Italian secret service knew about Joseph Mifsud, the erstwhile professor from Malta who had allegedly promised then candidate Donald Trump\u2019s campaign aide George Papadopoulos he could deliver Russian \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton. The Italian Justice Ministry public records show that Mifsud had applied for police protection in Italy after disappearing from Link University where he worked and, in doing so, had given a taped deposition to explain just why people might want to harm him.\n\nA source in the Italian Ministry of Justice, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The Daily Beast that Barr and Durham were played the tape. A second source within the Italian government also confirmed to The Daily Beast that Barr and Durham were shown other evidence the Italians had on Mifsud.\n\nEver since Robert Mueller concluded his probe in March 2019, Barr has worked to blunt its impact\u2014and investigate the investigators behind it. Barr assigned Durham to look into the Mueller probe\u2019s origins. And the Attorney General\u2019s name is listed in the whistleblower complaint about the July 25 call Trump made to the Ukrainian president to pressure him into investigating political rival Joe Biden. According to the complaint, Barr was directly involved in the president\u2019s attempt to \u201csolicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d The minutiae of his involvement are feeding a scandal gripping Washington that changes by the nano-second.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice did not return numerous emails and calls for clarification about Barr, Durham, and Mifsud. But they did issue a statement on Monday confirming that the American legal team had been in the eternal city.\n\n\u201cAs the Department of Justice has previously announced, a team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is investigating the origins of the U.S. counterintelligence probe of the Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\u201d Kerri Kupec, the Justice Department spokesperson, said in a statement. \u201cMr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr\u2019s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials.\u201d\n\nThe Italian intelligence community had Mifsud on their radar for some years before he got involved in the Trump campaign\u2019s troubles. His affiliations with both the Link University of Rome and London Center of International Law Practice\u2014both often affiliated with western diplomacy and foreign intelligence agencies\u2014made him an easy target. So did the slew of apartments he owned in Malta that are allegedly tied to a racket involving Russians buying Maltese passports for cheap.\n\nWhat Mifsud did or didn\u2019t know about Clinton\u2019s emails is still murky; what Barr and Durham were privy to is even less clear. Papadopoulos has distanced himself from the professor, tweeting just this week that he \u201cexposed Mifsud\u2019s connections to Italian intelligence\u201d even though the Italians were watching him long before they parted ways.\n\nMifsud met Papadopoulos through his Italian wife, Simona Mangiante, a lawyer and part-time lingerie model who had hoped to launch her acting career with a role playing French actress Brigitte Bardot in an American film. Mangiante told The Daily Beast last year that she met Mifsud doing some legal consulting for one of his classes. His ties to Russia seemed potentially useful to her husband, who was then an integral part of the Trump campaign\u2019s foreign policy advisory panel at the time.\n\nBefore he disappeared, Mifsud said he had met Papadopoulos \u201cthree or four times,\u201d helping to facilitate connections between \u201cofficial and unofficial sources\u201d in Italy, Russia, and Ukraine. He denied any wrongdoing but went into hiding\u2013either on his own or through the Italian protective services\u2014in 2017 and has only been seen in sporadic photos since.\n\nSeveral mainstream Italian newspapers on Tuesday reported that Mifsud is cooperating with Barr and Durham\u2019s investigation and some even suggested he met them in person in Rome last week. The Daily Beast reached Stephan Roh, Mifsud\u2019s Swiss lawyer, by phone Tuesday. Roh said he hadn\u2019t seen his client \u201cfor quite some time\u201d but that he \u201cdoubted\u201d he would show his face in Rome.\n\nThe sources in Rome who confirmed that Barr and Durham came to learn more about Mifsud also told The Daily Beast that they expected Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet the same intelligence agencies on his state visit that began Tuesday.\n\nPompeo is meeting the Italian president, the prime minister, and the Pope while in Rome. His official mandate is to discuss Libya, China trade, and sanctions on Russia, which Italy does not support. Pompeo will also be spending time with the U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Callista Gingrich and her husband, Newt. The Secretary of State is giving a keynote address at one of the ambassador\u2019s events on religious freedom at the Vatican, and has arranged some free time for a private viewing of the ancient Roman Colosseum. He will briefly visit the Umbrian hamlet of Valle Peligna, where his grandfather is from and where, perhaps coincidentally, Madonna\u2019s Italian family also has roots. He is then heading to Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Greece before returning to Washington.", "description": "US Attorney General William Barr traveled to Italy to meet with Italian secret service agents\u2014and, potentially, undermine the Mueller investigation.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569962602/191001-barbie-william-barr-tease_p6gsvr", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
