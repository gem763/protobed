Net profit fell by 14% to $2.9bn, missing analysts\u2019 forecasts too.\n\nHBSC said the miss was due to \u201creduced client activity resulting from ongoing economic uncertainty.\u201d\n\nBanks and corporates have been suffering from the ongoing trade conflict between the US and China. Falling interest rates have also hurt bank profitability and HSBC is particularly exposed to ongoing protests in Hong Kong, although it said performance in the market held up well.\n\nRevenue at the bank came in at $13.2bn in the third quarter, 4% below analyst forecasts and down from $13.8bn in the second quarter of the year.\n\nShares fell 3.4% in early trade in London.\n\n\u2018Not acceptable\u2019\n\nInterim CEO Noel Quinn blamed \u201ca challenging environment\u201d but admitted that \u201cin some parts, performance was not acceptable.\u201d He highlighted poor performance in Europe, the US, and the investment and commercial bank in the UK.\n\n\u201cOur previous plans are no longer sufficient to improve performance for these businesses, given the softer outlook for revenue growth,\u201d Quinn, who took over from John Flint in August, said. \u201cWe are therefore accelerating plans to remodel them, and move capital into higher growth and return opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe bank said it would \u201cact to rebalance our capital away from low-return businesses and adjust the cost base in line with the actions we take.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Barclays counts cost of PPI and warns outlook 'more challenging'\n\nHSBC did not outline specifics of its restructuring plans but Quinn\u2019s comments are likely to fuel fears of job cuts. The Financial Times has reported at the start of the month the bank is considering cutting up to 10,000 jobs as part of a sweeping overhaul.\n\n\u201cThis morning\u2019s Q3 numbers appear to support the case for radical action in culling areas where the bank is underperforming, with the US and Europe likely to bear the brunt,\u201d said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.com.\n\nHSBC said on Monday: \u201cWe are reviewing our plans and expect to update the market at (or before) our FY19 results in February 2020.\u201d\n\nHSBC warned it could take \u201csignificant charges\u201d related to the restructure in the next few quarters that would hit profitability. Revenue may also suffer if global market conditions continue to be weak. As a result, the bank does not expect to hit its target of return on tangible equity of 11% by 2020.\n\nHSBC becomes the third UK bank in the last week to warn of difficult market conditions. Barclays (BARC.L) warned of a \u201cmore challenging outlook\u201d on Friday and RBS (RBS.L) blamed poor performance at its markets business for an unexpected loss.\n\nREAD MORE: PPI claims surge and market ructions push RBS to a loss", "description": "Profit and revenue missed forecasts in the third quarter as the US-China trade war and low interest rates hit the business.", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fq8IWFKA.lYTPP5obhMmlw--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/2f06c520-f955-11e9-b7b3-4b24614bebd0", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
