Only 24% of drawings included pouring jugs in their logo - and this is the winner!\n\nOne of the most common mistakes included half of the Cadbury's drawings spelled incorrectly as 'Cadburys' (pictured)\n\nALDI\n\nAldi is one of the biggest names in the supermarket industry. Despite the regularity with which many of us see it, their logo (pictured) was one of the least successfully recreated\n\nBest\n\nJust like the original Aldi logo, this attempt features a dark blue background outlined in red, orange and yellow\n\nWhile 17% of drawings contained just an 'A' rather than the full brand name, this submission was pretty impressive\n\nWorst\n\nThis participants, which was amongst the worst of the attempts, thought the logo resided in a triangle rather than square\n\nMeanwhile, 22% of drawings coloured the text in yellow (pictured)\n\nOthers tested in the challenge opted for the wrong shades of colour altogether (pictured)\n\nBMW\n\nBMW is one of the most recognisable brands in the world, but for many, the crowded German car industry caused confusion. Pictured, the brand's real logo\n\nBest\n\nThe research found that 5% of drawings more closely resemble the logos of other leading German car brands. Pictured, one of the better attempts\n\nWorst\n\nA staggering 31% of the BMW drawings didn't include any text in their logo (pictured)\n\nOther submissions couldn't look less like the original logo if they tried (pictured)\n\nCADBURY'S\n\nA few succeeded in replicating the Cadbury's logo 0 but many got the spelling wrong and missed out the apostrophe. Pictured, the original logo\n\nBest\n\nAmongst the disastrous attempts, a few of the entrants put their memory to the test - and came out on top (pictured)\n\nWorst\n\nHalf of the one hundred Brits tested from across the nation produced Cadbury's drawings spelled incorrectly as 'Cadburys' (pictured)\n\nAnother participant had the right idea, but just didn't execute it properly (pictured)\n\nLACOSTE\n\nFrench sports clothing brand Lacoste is familiar for one thing \u2013 the crocodile. It appears to have paid off though with everyone drawing some form of the reptile...\n\nBest\n\nThe results showed that 85% of the Lacoste drawings didn't include the red in the crocodile's mouth - unlike this applaudable attempt\n\nWhile many missed out the red tongue, others draw the infamous crocodile Lacoste logo facing the wrong way round. Pictured, one of the better attempts\n\nWorst\n\nA shocking 31% of the drawings had the crocodile facing the wrong way (pictured)\n\nAnother entrant proved that they struggled to remember the renowned Lacoste logo - or just wasn't the artistic type\n\nLEGO\n\nLego was one of the most consistently drawn logos of the lot. Pictured, the logo the Brits had to replicate from memory\n\nBest\n\nOne participant made a good effort with a solid red background and white capital letters which were outlined in black and yellow\n\nAnother good attempt - considering 82% of drawings didn\u2019t include all four correct colours: yellow, red, white and black\n\nWorst\n\nFor one participant, they used it as an excuse to get a bit creative and use whichever colours they desired\n\nThe results found that 27% of drawings didn\u2019t wrap the text in a box (pictured)\n\nPUMA\n\nAnimals appeared to be the subject's downfall. Pictured, the actual logo participants attempted to draw from memory\n\nBest\n\nThe results showed that 39% of drawings didn\u2019t include the brand name, which is why this is one of our winners\n\nAnother solid attempt saw the puma facing the right way - and with the brand's logo. Full marks!\n\nWorst\n\nRather than big cats like the actual logo, many drew various different members of the animal kingdom - including tadpoles (pictured)", "description": "A drawing task has challenged people from up and down the UK to remember some of the world's most famous logos.
