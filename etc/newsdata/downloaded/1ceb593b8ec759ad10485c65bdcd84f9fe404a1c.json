I fully support the Prime Minister and will continue to serve in his Cabinet,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"We have spoken over the past 24 hours regarding the importance of the Rule of Law, which I as Lord Chancellor have taken an oath to uphold.\"\n\nThe UK Supreme Court will sit on Tuesday for the first day of a case on whether Johnson acted illegally by suspending parliament earlier this month.
