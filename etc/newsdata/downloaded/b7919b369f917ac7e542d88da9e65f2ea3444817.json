And then Poynter came along and presented its own list of 515 sites that spread false or misleading information.\n\nNow there\u2019s something called the \u201cAllSides\u201d media bias chart, and at least one library is using it to teach students which sources to avoid because of political bias. Our B.S. alarm went off when we saw NPR listed as right down the center.\n\nToday, the library taught my students to use the \"AllSides\" media bias chart when evaluating sources, and to avoid the far right and left. I hate this chart, but mostly because I'm supposed to believe The New Yorker is somehow equivalent to Breitbart. pic.twitter.com/Fx4abdxLqE \u2014 Dana Liebelson (@dliebelson) October 14, 2019\n\nMy point here being: It is really challenging for people to evaluate media sources! (And important!) I'm curious how other college-level instructors approach this, especially since my own knowledge-base is so steeped in media. \u2014 Dana Liebelson (@dliebelson) October 14, 2019\n\n(Also, I just want to make it clear, that my personal goal is that students think critically about *all* media sources, and I'm not pushing one source over the other, other than valuing accuracy and credibility.) \u2014 Dana Liebelson (@dliebelson) October 14, 2019\n\n\"My bias is better than your bias.\" \u2013 @dliebelson \u2014 Nick Searcy, INTERNATIONAL THOUGHT LEADER & STAR (@yesnicksearcy) October 14, 2019\n\nThe Hill being dead center is enough to dismiss this entirely.

Same for the Hill and AP \u2014 commonsense (@commonsense258) October 14, 2019\n\nAllSides seems to be the Snopes of media bias policing.\n\nThere are so many inaccuracies with that chart I don't know where to start. \u2014 thereal_kman (@thereal_kman) October 14, 2019\n\nimagine believing that Bret Stephens and David Brooks write for an opinion section in the same category as @jacobinmag \u2014 Will E.

NPR should at least be slightly left, and The Hill should be over with CNN Opinion. \u2014 NefariousNarwhal (@NecroticNewt) October 14, 2019\n\nThis is so outrageously bad. \u2014 Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) October 14, 2019\n\nDid they make this by putting the names of media outlets on a dartboard, then turning around and throwing darts at it with their back turned? \u2014 Jeffrey Young (@JeffYoung) October 14, 2019\n\nThis is the worst version of this chart I\u2019ve seen. \u2014 B (@MyNameIsntBrain) October 14, 2019\n\nShockingly bone-headed way to try to teach critical thought. \u2014 Sveta Istoothin (@istoothin) October 14, 2019\n\n\"Trust, but verify\" not only your news sources, but also your library's chart about news sources. \u2014 woke scold (@goblinbox) October 14, 2019\n\nThe chart is a example of media bias.

It should not be possible to read bias anywhere near an AP story, yet I see that a lot. \u2014 B.T. Mattison (@BT_Mattison) October 14, 2019\n\nBlown away by that chart.

AllSides really managed to offend both left- and right-wingers with this one.\n\nI ask my students (all international, non-native English speakers) to bring their sources to class, where we discuss them. We talk about perspective, bias, and good vs bad faith argument. We certainly don\u2019t use a chart like that! #TESOL \u2014 Ron Stack (@ronstack) October 14, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "Of course, all the liberals think their favorite sources are centrist.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wtf-am-i-looking-at_new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
