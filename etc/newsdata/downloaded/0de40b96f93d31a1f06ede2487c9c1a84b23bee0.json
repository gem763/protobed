The second stage will be a request for prototype proposals (RPP). Only four defense teams out of a larger group of initial participants have been selected to participate in the second stage.\n\nThe RPP is expected to be issued around Thanksgiving. The Army will issue contracts next spring for the delivery of four non-developmental RCV-L surrogates for evaluation, test, and manned-unmanned teaming experimentation, a Federal Business Opportunities notice from May explained.\n\nBefore the solicitation process began, defense firms attended an industry event at Texas A&M System's RELLIS Campus, where they conducted robotic combat vehicle technology demonstrations aimed at informing the requirements for the RCV program, Defense News reported.\n\nTo participate, the university revealed, the various firms had to present all-terrain vehicles capable of speeds between 15 and 75 mph able to carry payloads of at least 1,000 pounds out to a distance of at least 500 meters in any and all weather conditions.\n\nThe Army has characterized the RCV-L as an expendable platform designed primarily for reconnaissance that can be transported via CH-47 or C-130 and ready for combat within 15 minutes of disembarking.\n\nThe RCV-L is expected to travel at speeds of at least 25 mph in order to keep pace with its unit and associated vehicles and carry a payload of at least 1,200 pounds. The Multi-Mission Payloads (MMP) the vehicle will carry include lethality packages consisting of cannons and missiles for combat operations.\n\nThe RCV-L is also expected to have silent drive and 360-degree sensing capabilities.\n\nAt the Association of the United States Army conference in Washington, DC last week, Textron Systems, subsidiary Howe & Howe, and partner FLIR Systems unveiled the Ripsaw M5, a modular, scalable RCV platform able to serve as an RCV-L and RCV-M (Medium) pitch.\n\nRead more: Textron, Howe & Howe and FLIR roll out a small robot tank that can deploy drones in bid to build the Army's new robotic combat vehicle\n\nAt the conference, QinetiQ announced its partnership with Pratt & Miller, and HDT showed off its Hunter WOLF (Wheeled Offload Logistics Follower) unmanned ground vehicle. QinetiQ, Defense News reported, has plans to offer the Army a variation of its Expeditionary Modular Autonomous Vehicle (EMAV).\n\nIt is unclear at this time what Oshkosh Defense intends to bring to the table.", "description": "The Army is preparing for the next stage of development for its Robotic Combat Vehicle - Light, which will carry 1,200 pounds at 25 mph or faster.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dade62fcc4a0a0e395a9c82?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
