Vice President Rhodey,\u2019 Marvel writer Christopher Markus told ComicBook.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We took it out because it didn\u2019t have any story weight.\u2019\n\nWhen asked if the storyline was being saved for another film down the line, Christopher simply responded: \u2018No.\n\n\u2018If anything, I don\u2019t know what all the streaming shows are, but it feels like they might come off of Endgame in some ways.\u2019\n\n\u2018But at no point did anybody say, \u201cThat\u2019s what we should do, so therefore, sprinkle that in\u201d,\u2019 the film\u2019s writer revealed.\n\nIt does make us wonder though, if War Machine was going to be VP, who would\u2019ve been POTUS?\n\nThe star-studded Endgame cast celebrated the 11-year anniversary of the first Iron Man movie in May this year.\n\nRobert Downey Jr, who played Iron Man, shared a sweet video of the cast singing a rousing version of \u2018happy birthday\u2019.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
