No\u2019: ex-Soviet spy Viktor Suvorov speaks out Read more\n\nDescribing a \u201cculmination of months of mounting fear within the intelligence community\u201d, CNN said the decision to carry out the extraction was made shortly after a now infamous Oval Office meeting in May 2017 in which Trump, who had recently fired the FBI director, James Comey, discussed highly sensitive intelligence concerning Isis in Syria with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the then ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.\n\nThe report also said US officials had been alarmed by Trump\u2019s private meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Hamburg in July that year.\n\nCNN cited \u201ca source with knowledge of the intelligence community\u2019s response\u201d to the Trump-Putin meeting as saying: \u201cOfficials again expressed concern that the president may have improperly discussed classified intelligence with Russia.\u201d\n\nIt also said Trump and \u201ca small number of senior officials\u201d were \u201cinformed in advance of the extraction\u201d.\n\nThe report added: \u201cDetails of the extraction itself remain secret and the whereabouts of the asset today are unknown to CNN.\u201d\n\nThe leak in 2010 of classified US diplomatic cables revealed how successive US administrations have struggled to find high-level assets inside the Russian government with genuine knowledge of key decisions and players.\n\nGenerally speaking, US diplomats have relied on a public network of scholars and Russian journalists to make sense of Kremlin affairs. The Kremlin \u2013 made up largely of ex-KGB officers \u2013 is paranoid about western spies, especially American ones.\n\nThe penalty for cooperating with western intelligence services has been laid bare in a series of extraterritorial assassinations, including the 2006 polonium murder in London of Alexander Litvinenko, and the 2018 novichok attack on the former GRU military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal.\n\nIn 2017 Russia arrested two top cybersecurity officials in the FSB security services and charged them with treasonous links to the CIA. Russian media reported that one of the men had been marched out of a gathering at the FSB with a bag over his head.\n\nThe last-known US intelligence asset to be exfiltrated from Russia was Alexander Poteyev, a deputy director of the \u201cillegals\u201d programme of spies operating in the US run by Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service. He escaped Russia in 2010, shortly before the FBI rounded up 10 Russian agents in the US whose identities it is believed he gave away to the Americans. Tried in absentia in Russia, it was reported he fled the country via Belarus on a passport belonging to a Russian citizen who had previously applied for a US visa. He now lives in hiding in the US.\n\nOn Monday, John Sipher, a former member of the CIA Senior Intelligence Service, wrote on Twitter: \u201cRecruiting a source with key access is extremely hard. A source in a key position may happen once a generation, if ever. Keeping him or her safe is daunting work. It is a big deal to lose these kind of sources.\u201d\n\nThe mystery of Trump\u2019s relationship with \u2013 and publicly expressed regard for \u2013 Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, fuels continued speculation.\n\nEarlier this year, special counsel Robert Mueller concluded a near-two-year investigation of the matter. Mueller did not establish a conspiracy between Trump aides and Moscow but he did lay out extensive contacts between Trump and Russia and numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nTrump says US officials staying at his resorts 'nothing to do with me' \u2013 live Read more\n\nOn Monday, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, told CNN its reporting was \u201cnot only incorrect, it has the potential to put lives in danger\u201d.\n\nThe CIA director of public affairs, Brittany Bramell, said its \u201cnarrative that the Central Intelligence Agency makes life-or-death decisions based on anything other than objective analysis and sound collection is simply false.\n\n\u201cMisguided speculation that the president\u2019s handling of our nation\u2019s most sensitive intelligence \u2013 which he has access to each and every day \u2013 drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate.\u201d\n\nShortly after the CNN report was released, the president attacked the network on Twitter.\n\nTrump did not immediately mention the report, instead commenting on the network\u2019s corporate fortunes and adding: \u201cBut most importantly, CNN is bad for the USA.\u201d", "description": "Decision to carry out extraction made shortly after 2017 meeting in which Trump discussed sensitive intelligence with Russians, CNN reports", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly", "Luke Harding", "Shaun Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/917b14ccd11bd5f4fea2dbd6b67de856edda6f9c/172_113_3924_2355/master/3924.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d0a472c6d7e4618111ee7d51c28890a", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
