Cao Shi, 34, from Chongqing, is one of them.\n\n\"I was amazed by the natural beauty of the Giant's Causeway, an area of interlocking basalt columns, and also the Dark Hedges, an avenue of beech trees. When I immersed myself in the scenery, I couldn't help but recall the plots in Game of Thrones,\" he said.\n\nAlso known as GoT and based on the novels by George R. R. Martin, Game of Thrones is the biggest TV show in the world, and has been broadcast in more than 170 countries and territories. On average, each episode of Season 7 was viewed by some 31 million people, according to Northern Ireland Screen.\n\nThe agency said an estimated 251 million pounds ($324 million) in spending on goods and services such as the cast, the crew, hotels, facilities and transportation had been returned to the Northern Ireland economy as a result of scenes in Game of Thrones being filmed in the region, from the pilot episode through to the final Season 8. The last episode of the series aired on Sunday.\n\nNorthern Ireland Screen gave the show 15.95 million pounds in production funding from the local government, in addition to UK tax breaks.\n\nJudith Webb, screen tourism officer at Tourism Northern Ireland, said there is a proven relationship between screen content and tourism.\n\nCountries and regions that attract high-quality movie and television productions can benefit from related growth in tourism, as shown by the impact of the Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings series on locations in the UK and New Zealand, respectively, Webb said.\n\nShe added, \"GoT has transformed Northern Ireland into a leading international screen tourism destination, attracting many more visitors and fans of the show to explore the stunning landscapes, coastlines and mountains showcased in the series.\"\n\nLast year, one in six tourists from outside Northern Ireland was attracted to the region by the success of Game of Thrones, boosting the local economy by more than 50 million pounds.\n\nThe Belfast Telegraph reported that new research by e-commerce company Criteo showed that the \"Game of Thrones effect\" has seen tourism bookings double at some filming locations in Northern Ireland.\n\nStrangford, a village in County Down with a population of 450 which lies near to Castle Ward, the location for many of the Winterfell scenes in Game of Thrones, reported a 112 percent rise in tourist bookings early this year, the research found.\n\nThe direct advantage of the bulk of the show being produced in Northern Ireland is that it has employed large numbers of local crew members, with almost everyone in the filming locations having some kind of link to the series.\n\nWilliams, from Northern Ireland Screen, said, \"If you talk to any extended family group in Northern Ireland, they will have some sort of connection.\n\n\"Somebody's son, daughter or uncle is an extra. Somebody else is involved in providing facilities. Someone is a driver, someone is able to tell you a story about the cast coming into a local pub or restaurant.\n\n\"It's a small place, so when you film something as big as GoT here, you end up with a scenario where everybody has some sort of connection to it.\"\n\nIn addition to Northern Ireland, the show has been filmed in a wide range of other locations, including Croatia, Spain, Iceland and Morocco.\n\nAccording to the Croatian National Tourist Board, the city of Dubrovnik has seen rising numbers of tourists, particularly from China, after being used as the location for King's Landing in the show. Several scenes were shot at the Walls of Dubrovnik and at Fort Lovrijenac.", "description": "Visitors flock to locations featured in TV blockbuster.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201905/22/5ce5081ea3104842e4aeee75.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-05-22"}
