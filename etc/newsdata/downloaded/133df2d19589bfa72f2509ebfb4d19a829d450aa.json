We\u2019re not sure which we like better: the guy absconding with Extinction Rebellion sign and chucking it over the fence, or the climate change alarmist who, freed from her videography duties, desperately runs into the middle of the intersection to block several lanes of traffic from four directions.\n\nHere\u2019s the view from one of the protester\u2019s cameras:\n\nyou have officially left the safe space pic.twitter.com/KKg4ZwO1BP \u2014 TyIer (@tyIerzilla) October 18, 2019\n\nAnd here\u2019s the view from above, which really captures the magic:\n\nHah.

They\u2019re the same clowns who recently climbed on top of a British Airways jet and a London commuter train (which did not go well for them, nor for the woman who glued herself to the train).\n\nIntentionally blocking traffic in order to inflict a political message on others is one of the more evil things anyone can do. You're delaying emergency vehicles, placing lives at risk and causing massive upheaval in peoples' lives. AND it's doing NOTHING for your 'cause'. \u2014 Furrystoat \u0646 (@Furrystoat) October 19, 2019\n\nBeyond that is a form of tyranny! I decide something is a problem and what has to be done to fix it and everyone else is going to do as I decide or I will interrupt their lives! This thinking is how tyrants use useful idiots to place them in power! \u2014 Indy Visualist (@IVisualist) October 19, 2019\n\nGood for him.
