Zervos is one of about a dozen women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct shortly before the 2016 election, and her case could reach its conclusion before voters return to the polls next year.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has denied accusations of sexual impropriety and said he never even met Zervos at the Beverly Hills Hotel. \u201cTo be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago,\u201d Trump said after she made her accusation.\n\nAD\n\nBut Zervos\u2019s lawyer said the documents, and others the Trump Organization has held back from public view, back up her client\u2019s claims.\n\nZervos\u2019s \u201caccount of the underlying sexual assaults has now been corroborated, in close detail, by documents produced from [Trump\u2019s] own files,\u201d Zervos\u2019s lawyer Mariann Wang wrote in a memo filed on Thursday.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer in the case, Marc Kasowitz, told the Associated Press Thursday that Zervos\u2019s claims are \u201centirely meritless and not corroborated by any documents.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump called Zervos and other women who have made accusations against him \u201cliars,\u201d prompting Zervos to sue him for defamation.\n\nThe documents released Thursday were made public as part of an agreement between Zervos\u2019s and Trump\u2019s legal teams. The filings include some of the hundreds of documents produced by the Trump Organization in the discovery phase of the lawsuit that the company had deemed confidential.\n\nAD\n\nAmong the new documents are email correspondence between Zervos and Trump\u2019s secretary, Rhona Graff, from the fall of 2007, where Zervos asks to meet Trump.\n\n\u201cI Will be in New York Late November, and would like the chance to take Mr. Trump to lunch,\u201d Zervos wrote to Graff on Oct. 1, 2007. \u201cI simply think a lot of him and would look forward to visiting with him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we keep it casual,\u201d Graff responded. \u201cCall me when you are in town, and you can certainly pop over if it\u2019s convenient.\u201d\n\nZervos, who has said she hoped to work for the Trump Organization and wanted professional advice, has said she visited Trump in his office in Trump Tower in New York.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived he kissed me on the lips,\u201d Zervos said in a 2016 statement. \u201cI was surprised, but felt that perhaps that was just his form of greeting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs the meeting was wrapping up, Zervos said Trump kissed her again and she was \u201cupset\u201d by this and told friends and family.\n\nZervos has said she later met Trump for a lunch meeting at the Beverly Hills Hotel, when she said the unwanted fondling occurred. Despite the nature of the encounter, she said, she voluntarily met him again the next day at Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.\n\nAD\n\nThe calendar records provided by the Trump Organization show that Trump left Las Vegas on Dec. 21, 2007, arrived in Los Angeles, and went to the Beverly Hills Hotel that afternoon, along with his bodyguard Keith Schiller. The entry for the next day says he visited the \u201cTrump National Golf Club\u201d in the morning before departing Los Angeles the following day.\n\nThe Zervos case is emerging as one of the more pressing legal challenges to Trump, who is facing legal challenges on many fronts, from the impeachment inquiry on the Hill to lawsuits targeting his businesses and finances.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have tried to block Zervos\u2019s suit, arguing that the president is immune from such state court lawsuits. But in March, a New York appellate court ruled that Trump had to face the defamation lawsuit.\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, a judge set a deadline of Dec. 6 for depositions, meaning Trump may have to make a statement or answer questions under oath. Trump\u2019s lawyers have signaled their intent to appeal.\n\nThe discovery phase of the lawsuit is ongoing.\n\nThe Zervos case is not the only defamation lawsuit Trump has faced as president. Adult-film actress Stormy Daniels had filed a separate suit against Trump, arguing that he defamed her when he suggested she had lied about being threatened to keep quiet about their alleged past relationship. That lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge last year.\n\nAD", "description": "Attorney for Summer Zervos said the calendar excerpts made public Thursday corroborate her client\u2019s claims.", "authors": ["Joshua Partlow", "National", "Foreign Affairs.
