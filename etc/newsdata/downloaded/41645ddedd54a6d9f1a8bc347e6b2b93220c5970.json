At a second hearing with MEPs, Goulard expressed regret for a lucrative job she held with a US thinktank while she was an MEP.\n\nAn \u00c9lys\u00e9e official said Goulard\u2019s competence and European commitment had been recognised by all, but she had been \u201cthe object of a political game that affects the commission as a whole\u201d.\n\nMacron later insisted he was \u201cvery relaxed\u201d as what mattered to him was the portfolio France would get at the commission. \u201cI need to understand what has been in play. Resentment, perhaps pettiness. But I need to understand.\u201d\n\nGoulard was an early supporter of Macron in the European parliament after the upstart presidential candidate formed La R\u00e9publique En March bidding to break the stranglehold of the established centre-right and centre-left. She became his defence minister but resigned after a month when a magistrate launched a preliminary investigation into allegations her party misused European parliament funds.\n\nNominated as France\u2019s EU commissioner, she faced hostile questions from MEPs over those allegations and her work for the Los Angeles-based Berggruen Institute from October 2013 to the end of 2015, when she was paid more than \u20ac10,000 a month while working as an MEP.\n\nOn Thursday, she said she deserved the presumption of innocence over the allegations, which have never been tested in court. But she voiced regret for the thinktank job which she said had cast a doubt over her integrity and independence, values that she said were of \u201cthe utmost importance\u201d to her.\n\nGoulard\u2019s vulnerabilities were heightened because MEPs have already rejected a centre-right commissioner candidate (from Hungary), as well as a socialist (a Romanian), meaning the parliament\u2019s two biggest groups were looking for the weak points in her liberal group.\n\nSome in the parliament suggested the outcome was \u201cWeber\u2019s revenge\u201d, as Macron had crushed the hopes of Manfred Weber, a German centre-right MEP leader who aspired to lead the European commission but who was blocked by the French president.\n\nIn a statement, the liberal group (Renew Europe) said it deeply regretted the vote against \u201can excellent, skilled and committed pro-European commissioner\u201d adding that she had \u201cpaid the price of European and domestic petty politics over an objective assessment of the commissioner candidates\u201d.\n\nThe defeat is likely to trigger recriminations in the group over how they managed to lose Goulard in such a decisive way: 82 of the 112 MEPs eligible to vote on her appointment voted against her.\n\nGoulard\u2019s critics said the case showed the problems with the current system for assessing conflicts of interests.\n\n\u201cWe obviously did not vote for Goulard,\u201d said Manon Aubry of the radical left Unbowed France party. \u201cEU citizens won\u2019t put their trust in their institutions when a commissioner sees absolutely no problem in making \u20ac10,000 a month from a private lobby in addition to her MEP salary.\u201d\n\nThe debacle has raised questions about whether the current European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, will be asked to extend his mandate beyond 1 November.\n\nVon der Leyen, nominated as his successor in July, can only assume office following a positive vote in favour of her 26 commissioners. She now has three gaps, with neither a French nor a Romanian candidate. (Hungary proposed a career diplomat, Oliv\u00e9r Varh\u00e9lyi, after L\u00e1zsl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi was rejected over an alleged conflict of interest, but the new nominee has yet to clear the parliament).\n\nFollowing the vote, Von der Leyen met MEP group leaders and the European parliament president. \u201cWith so much at stake, it is now necessary, together with parliament, to speed up the process so that Europe can act swiftly,\u201d she said in a statement that referred to the tasks of the next five years, including Brexit, climate change, trade, migration and digitalisation. \u201cAt the same time, all involved in the process need sufficient time to approach the next steps with care.\u201d", "description": "France\u2019s candidate Sylvie Goulard rejected over job with thinktank and party\u2019s alleged misuse of funds", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960bf69ec3f3df8c7e20f997795757c51b2bc68d/0_46_2411_1447/master/2411.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5060ca3d472d0683eeec6389805a2c05", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
