Liz Cheney (R-WY) suggested that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria and attack on America\u2019s Kurdish allies was tied to Democrats launching an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Wyoming congresswoman and co-host Brian Kilmeade, both of whom have been critical of Trump\u2019s decision to pull back American troops and abandon the Kurds ahead of Turkey\u2019s invasion, expressed their concerns that ISIS could return to the area and the United States\u2019 reputation among its allies will suffer.\n\nCheney, meanwhile, took the opportunity to lay blame at House Democrats\u2019 feet for pursuing impeachment against Trump over the Ukraine scandal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about it, Brian,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that what we\u2019re seeing happen is going to have ramifications not just in the Middle East but around the world. If our adversaries begin to seek weakness, if our adversaries begin to think we won\u2019t defend our allies, that we won\u2019t defend our interests, that\u2019s provocative.\u201d\n\nCheney continued: \u201cBut I also want to say that the impeachment proceedings that are going on and what the Democrats are doing themselves to try to weaken this president is part of this.\u201d\n\nAfter Kilmeade agreed with Cheney, the Republican lawmaker added that it \u201cwas not an accident that the Turks chose this moment to roll across the border.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think the Democrats have got to pay very careful attention to the damage that they\u2019re doing with the impeachment proceedings,\u201d she concluded.\n\nOne of the most hawkish members of Congress, the House Republican Conference chairwoman has attempted to straddle a fine line when it comes to criticizing the president\u2019s foreign policy while simultaneously kissing up to Trump. Just last month, Cheney found herself in a \u201cbutt-kissing\u201d spat with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), with the two of them fighting over Trump\u2019s attention.", "description": "\u201cAnd I think the Democrats have got to pay very careful attention to the damage that they\u2019re doing with the impeachment proceedings,\u201d she concluded.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571080354/fox-and-friends_34_ojzn1o", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
