They held the lead for the vast majority of the game, just their second without the suspended Deandre Ayton. Devin Booker ended the night with 30 points, but went off in the fourth quarter to score 16 of those.\n\nThe fourth quarter, when the Suns winning felt more and more certain and the hometown crowd kept chanting \u201cBEAT -L-A,\u201d is also when the Clippers\u2019 Patrick Beverley fouled out. When Beverley exited with 6:01 left in the game, the Suns\u2019 bench didn\u2019t miss a chance to rub it in \u2014 they waved to him as he left.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBooker fouls out Pat Bev and the Suns' bench waves goodbye. pic.twitter.com/i4wyTK0zUI \u2014 NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) October 27, 2019\n\nThe Suns were leading by 13 at that point, on their way to their first win against the Clippers in three years.\n\nTrue to form, Clippers head coach Doc Rivers spoke the truth after the game.

They were so much more committed to what they were doing. In every aspect of the game, I just thought they were better.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers have three more games against the Suns this season, so they\u2019ll have more chances to do better. They next meet on Dec. 17 in Los Angeles.\n\nPatrick Beverley's fourth quarter foul on Devin Booker sent him packing from the game, and gave the Suns bench a chance to wave goodbye to him. (Mark J.
