However, Hodgson\u2019s side have scored only three goals.\n\n\u201cThe defence has been pretty good throughout my time here,\u201d Hodgson told reporters ahead of Saturday\u2019s league trip to Tottenham Hotspur. \u201cOur problem... is we don\u2019t score enough goals at the other end to get the wins we\u2019d like.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re keeping clean sheets and keeping it tight, you make it that much harder for the opposition. We do have players who, given time and space, can use it to their advantage. We have to make certain we don\u2019t relent on that side of our game.\n\n\u201cWhen the opposition have the ball, we have to work very hard to... keep in shape. If the game becomes very open and it comes down to who scores the most goals, we might not always come out on top.\u201d\n\nPalace\u2019s defensive record will be put to the test against Spurs after Hodgson confirmed defender Martin Kelly would miss the game with a groin injury while veteran centre back Scott Dann faces a late fitness test.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of people we need to assess in the morning: Scott Dann and (midfielder) James McArthur,\u201d Hodgson added.\n\n\u201cMartin Kelly is injured, of course, and has been since the game against Aston Villa. So we won\u2019t have him or (forward) Connor Wickham, who is also injured. But otherwise, we\u2019re okay.\u201d", "description": "Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson on Friday praised his side's defensive solidity at the start of the Premier League campaign but said he was worried about the lack of goals at the other end of the pitch.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429495505&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1R1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
