But scientists believe that there probably isn\u2019t just one purpose to dreaming, but many:\n\nMemory consolidation\n\nDreaming is partly to do with making memories. We know that when we learn something, the brain activity associated with that memory spontaneously occurs again during sleep \u2013 known as replay. This is associated with strengthening memories, integrating them, and protecting them against interference. The theory is that sometimes these reactivations, which we\u2019re having all the time when we\u2019re asleep, come to consciousness and manifest as dreams.\n\nProcessing trauma\n\nAnother theory is that dreams are a way of reliving events that are to some extent traumatic in order to knock off their emotional edges. By going over the event in a safe space, we learning to separate the incident from the emotion attached to it.\n\nProblem solving\n\nDreams are also thought to be the brains attempt to solve life\u2019s problems. (The phrase \u201cbetter to sleep on it\u201d has a strong grounding in science.) There is research that shows that we come up with very creative solutions immediately after we\u2019ve been dreaming. Paul McCartney famously dreamt the melody to Yesterday, the plot to Misery came to Stephen King in a dream, and The Periodic Table was also famously the result of a dream.\n\nDo our dreams mean anything?\n\nOver the ages people have attached great importance to dreams. Some thought dreams were the gods communicating with them, or that a bad dream foretold real peril in a person\u2019s life. Famous psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud believed that we repressed various thoughts from our consciousness that in sleep would then bubble forth in the form of dreams, telling us an awful lot about our sexual urges and deepest desires. In terms of the Freudian approach, modern day psychology suggests there might be something in it. Dreams are certainly not meaningless.", "description": "Can you find meaning in your dreams, and can they help give you new ideas?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07q0k40.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
