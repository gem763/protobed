Created by Ryan Murphy, the show is full of his signature devious twists and turns and controversial moments. One such storyline is centred around Jessica Lange\u2019s character -- Dusty Jackson -- a leopard print-clad, whisky-sipping, cigarette-smoking, expletive-screaming grandmother, who *spoiler alert* has been poisoning her granddaughter, Infinity, convincing her (and everyone else) that she has cancer.\n\nIf this plot sounds familiar, it\u2019s because The Politician is the latest show to explore \u201cMunchausen syndrome by proxy\u201d. Nicknamed after Baron Munchausen, a character from 18th century German literature who was a compulsive liar, Munchausen syndrome is a mental health issue in which a person makes up an illness or injury. In 1951, British endocrinologist Richard Asher first used the term \"Munchausen syndrome\", with \"by proxy\" added 20 years later to describe the process of pretending a person under their care is ill. Despite being widely known as \u201cMunchausens\u201d, the American Psychiatric Association officially recognised the disorder, both individual and by proxy, as \"Factitious Disorder\" in 2013.\n\nOver the last two years, it has been impossible to escape examples of Factitious Disorder on screen, manifesting itself as the trope of the \u201cmother poisoner\u201d. In HBO miniseries Sharp Objects, Camille (Amy Adams) discovered her mother had been drugging her children, including herself, and killed her oldest child by deliberately poisoning them. Patricia Arquette recently won an Emmy for her lead role in The Act, in which her character Dee Dee Blanchard convinces her daughter that she has a series of imaginary ailments. Both BBC Three\u2019s Clique and ITV\u2019s 2019 drama Deep Water, also featured mothers who intentionally harm their children.\n\nIn film, 2018\u2019s Phantom Thread depicts the marriage between Alma (Vicky Krieps) and Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis), with Alma poisoning her husband to keep him docile and compliant. No diagnosis is made on-screen, but director Paul Thomas Anderson explicitly mentioned Munchausens in an interview about the film. It\u2019s also implied in 2017 horror film It that Eddie\u2019s mother is obsessively medicating him unnecessarily, though we never see it officially diagnosed.\n\nContinually, the disorder is portrayed inaccurately. Firstly, TV shows and films rarely refer to the illness by its actual name, even though Factitious Disorder has been the correct term for six years. According to Dr Marc Feldman, an expert on the disorder, a lack of research is driving these inaccurate portrayals. He told TV Guide that he couldn\u2019t bring himself to watch The Politician, saying: \u201cDusty's actions look more like malingering -- when people fake sick to get tangible goods -- versus Munchausen by proxy, which is driven by a need for attention and sympathy.\u201d\n\n\"Illnesses like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Schizophrenia and Munchausen by proxy are still frequently portrayed badly, with writers often choosing 'cheap tropes' over their duty of care to viewers.\"\n\nDr Thomas Hardy, Medical Registrar and Education Fellow at Kingston Hospital, London, explains that pop-culture routinely mischaracterises illnesses. \u201cTV and film play a massive part in persuading people to misdiagnose themselves or others,\u201d he says. \u201cWriters often misunderstand the brutal realities of severe psychiatric illnesses.\u201d Dr. Hardy says that TV shows are getting better, with soaps -- some of which work directly with health organisations -- leading the way. But illnesses like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Schizophrenia and Munchausen by proxy are still frequently portrayed badly, with writers often choosing \u201ccheap tropes\u201d over their duty of care to viewers.\n\nSo why is Munchausen having such an on-screen moment? After all, it is estimated that there are a tiny amount of cases (600 to 1200) in the US every year. Anna Leszkiewicz, culture editor of the New Statesman, wrote last year about what the emergence of this trend says about our \u201cdisdain of women\u201d and how the resurgence of the \u201cmother poisoner\u201d is a reflection of current anxieties relating to motherhood. \u201cWestern culture, with its simultaneous sanctification and vilification of the feminine, has always relished portraits of terrible mothers and evil, sly female poisoners,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe gulf between society\u2019s standards for motherhood and the reality of what\u2019s possible for a parent is getting wider and wider. It\u2019s no surprise we\u2019ve become intoxicated by Munchausen by proxy, the most disturbing attempt to bridge the abyss.\u201d\n\nHannah Davies, deputy TV editor of The Guardian, agrees that there\u2019s likely societal factors driving the \u201cmother poisoner\u201d resurgence. \u201cThis could definitely tie into the sense of uncertainty and danger a lot of people feel about the world we\u2019re living in,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause what is more dangerous than the person that's meant to be caring for you -- your mother -- hurting you?\u201d\n\nAlthough official NHS guidelines on \u201cfabricated or induced illness\u201d suggest that mothers are much more likely to be perpetrators, there seems to be a total absence of men who have Factitious Disorder portrayed as perpetrators in culture. When you consider that men are far more likely to be at the root of familial abuse, popular culture\u2019s obsession with Munchausen by proxy -- one of the few forms of abuse where women are more likely to be perpetrators, which is extremely rare in the first place -- stinks of misogyny.\n\nHowever, while utilising the trope usually vilifies women with Munchausen by proxy, it can also celebrate them, too. What\u2019s so fascinating about The Politician\u2019s Munchausen by proxy storyline is that, unlike Sharp Objects and The Act, the show celebrates its perpetrator. Jessica Lange\u2019s character is funny and likeable, and at points it\u2019s as if we\u2019re supposed to root for her as she scams her way onto all expenses trips to Disneyland using her granddaughter\u2019s \u201cillness\u201d.\n\n\"The portrayal of Factitious Disorder in The Politician arguably sets up Jessica Lange\u2019s character as a campy matriarch primed for gay men to stan. In this way it parallels the sociological concept of 'double deviance' in relation to gay men stanning 'bad' women.\"\n\nHannah links this to what she describes as a current celebration of \u201cscammer\u201d culture. \u201cWe're in the golden age of scam, from Fyre Festival to Brexit,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut our reactions to scams are often very gendered.\u201d She notes that people salivate over women like Silicon Valley\u2019s former spin doctor Elizabeth Holmes, or fake heiress Anna Delvey, being involved in scams. Whether its Felicity Huffman\u2019s involvement in the US college admissions scandal or Rebekah Vardy being forced to deny that she leaked stories about Coleen Rooney to The Sun, stories about alleged female scammers do produce particular fervour.\n\nThis is also problematic, though. Sarah Manavis, a journalist who focuses on digital culture, believes that the celebration of female scammers \u201cis rooted in a dressed-up misogynistic obsession -- picking apart stories about women under the guise of stan culture\u201d. So, \u201crather than being blatantly sexist,\u201d she adds, \u201cit's cloaked with internet language, memes and faux-adoration. But the obsession is rooted in the same thing: a fascination with women doing wrong.\u201d\n\nThe portrayal of Factitious Disorder in The Politician arguably sets up Jessica Lange\u2019s character as a campy matriarch primed for gay men to stan. In this way it parallels the sociological concept of \u201cdouble deviance\u201d in relation to gay men stanning \u201cbad\u201d women. Double deviance describes the process of women being judged more harshly by society for immoral or criminal behaviour because they are assumed to be \u201cdeviant\u201d in terms of breaking the law, and \u201cdeviant\u201d in terms of rejecting gender norms. Women who harm their children are, for example, often sentenced to longer in prison and scrutinised more heavily by the media than abusive or murderous fathers. Given that many gay men will have heard homosexuality described as \u201cdeviant\u201d growing up, it is unsurprising that so many are stimulated by women who digress from gendered expectations to be submissive, kind and well-behaved.\n\nOf course it might sound flippant and sinister to suggest that mothers who abuse their children are just being subversive. After all, in the dynamic between parent and child, they\u2019re the one with the power. But looking with a wider lens, some viewers clearly perceive that these women are subverting the patriarchal expectation for them to be caring, adoring and rule-abiding. For a moment, we convince ourselves that they\u2019re somehow \u201cscamming\u201d the patriarchy. But when it comes down to it, even when it\u2019s dressed up as a celebration or memeable stanhood, pop-culture\u2019s obsession with \u201cmother poisoners\u201d vilifies women. This trope is just another example of the patriarchy scamming -- and fucking -- us all.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Netflix's 'The Politician' is the latest show to explore the rare mental health condition", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dadce7c5c1f5f000a31d3da/lede/1571671841847-2019-10-21.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8427xh;0xw,0.1573xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
