He was due to attend as one of the event\u2019s past legends.\n\nThe Springboks, who are in Japan preparing for the tournament, were devastated by the news of his death, coach Rassie Erasmus said.\n\n\u201cThis was horrible news to wake up to,\u201d Erasmus said in a statement. \u201cThere was a very sombre mood in the breakfast room, it really is unbelievable news.\n\n\u201cOnly this week our management team was chatting to Chester about his plans to come to the tournament and about tickets for Rugby World Cup matches.\n\n\u201cIt will take us some time to get over this shock.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 death is the second in less than two months from South Africa\u2019s title-winning side of 1995 in which he was the only non-white player.\n\nFellow wing James Small also died following a heart attack aged just 50 on July 10.\n\nWilliams\u2019 try-scoring exploits, and trademark broad smile, made him an instant hero and gave black South Africans a reason to support the Springboks in the early years of the country\u2019s transition away from apartheid.\n\nHe had been injured before the World Cup but returned for the quarter-final against Western Samoa, becoming a household name overnight after scoring four tries in a 42-14 win.\n\nPlayer of the year in South Africa in 1994, Williams\u2019 career was plagued by knee injuries that restricted his test appearances.\n\n\u201cThe news of Chester\u2019s passing is devastating and hard to believe, as he was still young and seemingly in good health,\u201d said SA Rugby president Mark Alexander.\n\n\u201cChester was a true pioneer in South African rugby and his performances at the World Cup in 1995, as a snapshot of his Springbok career, will forever be etched in the hearts and minds of our rugby public. His influence stretched wider than just the rugby world.\u201d\n\nKobus Wiese, a \u201895 team mate, paid tribute to \u201ca talented player, an important member of our rugby family, a loving father who adored his children, a man loved by his community.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a group our hearts are bleeding and filled with sadness at the loss of our brother,\u201d he added\n\nWorld Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont added on Twitter: \u201cDesperately saddened to hear of Chester Williams\u2019s passing. A symbol of the rainbow nation, Chester\u2019s name will forever epitomize a remarkable and transformational Rugby World Cup 1995. We\u2019ve lost a great, engaging man far too soon.\u201d\n\nWilliams, married with three children, turned to coaching after his playing days, starting with the South African sevens side that won bronze at the Commonwealth Games in 2002. He worked later in Uganda, Romania and Tunisia.\n\nHe was coaching the University of the Western Cape at the time of his death and had recently launched his own beer to coincide with the Rugby World Cup build-up.", "description": "World Cup winner Chester Williams, who broke racial barriers to emerge a national hero as one of South Africa's first black rugby union internationals, died after a suspected heart attack on Friday.
