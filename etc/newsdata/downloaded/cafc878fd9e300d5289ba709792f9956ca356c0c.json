The complaint also documents Trump abusing his office for personal gain. Abusing one\u2019s office for personal gain is a textbook definition of the federal crime of bribery and extortion. It\u2019s also a textbook definition of an impeachable offense.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the quid pro quo. The complaint makes it clear that for several months before the July 25 call, Trump was already trying to make it clear to Zelenskiy that he must initiate the investigations that Trump wanted. According to the complaint, on May 14, Trump told Vice President Mike Pence to cancel a planned trip to attend Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration on May 20. Instead Trump sent Rick Perry, the secretary of energy. The whistle-blower says that it was \u201cmade clear\u201d to U.S. government officials \u201cthat the president did not want to meet with Mr. Zelenskyy until he saw how Zelenskyy \u2018chose to act\u2019 in office.\u201d The whistle-blower suggests that this message was communicated to Zelenskiy, although the whistle-blower does not know how that happened.\n\nIt will obviously be necessary to question Perry about whether he carried such a message. (And in the meantime, a good lawyer would tell the secretary that he had better stop talking about the whole scandal on CNN.)\n\nThe fact the Trump was already trying to send a message to Zelenskiy in May provides crucial context for what happened on July 18, when someone in the Office of Management and Budget told the rest of the government that aid to Ukraine was being suspended. The whistle-blower says White House officials said explicitly that the order came directly from Trump, and that \u201cneither OMB nor NSC [National Security Council] staff knew why this instruction had been issued.\u201d\n\nAll this makes it very clear that Trump stopped the payments to create leverage against Zelenskiy to get the investigations going. The failure to explain the policy rationale to the rest of the government is highly probative that the president knew his rationale wouldn\u2019t wash if it were shared with his own officials. It is highly unusual for a policy decision to be attributed directly to the president by senior officials without them being able to say or explain why it was taken.\n\nThe content of the July 25 phone call itself is laid out in more detail in the summary released yesterday than in the whistle-blower complaint. But one thing the complaint does make clear is that Zelenskiy came to understand that he was being told to take action on the investigations in exchange for unfreezing the aid. The complaint points out that, on the evening of July 25, Ukrainian president\u2019s website included a Russian language readout of the phone call that said the Trump had \u201cexpressed his conviction\u201d that the new Ukrainian government would be able to \u201ccomplete the investigation of corruption cases that have held back cooperation between Ukraine and the United States.\u201d\n\nThe statement amounted to an explicit recognition of the quid pro quo: According to the Ukrainian president\u2019s understanding of what Trump had said, the investigations were what had \u201cheld back cooperation\u201d \u2014 that is, the aid was being held back pending the start of the investigations.\n\nTaken together with Trump\u2019s action in suspending the aid, the Ukrainian acknowledgment of Trump\u2019s proposed exchange strongly indicates that both sides knew exactly what had happened on the call. It\u2019s hard to imagine more explicit evidence of the quid pro quo, short of a recorded conversation.\n\nThe whistle-blower also makes it clear that U.S. officials who heard the call understood that this was what had happened. Their contemporaneous interpretation of the phone call is also very strong evidence of a quid pro quo. These government officials told the whistle-blower that they believed they had \u201cwitnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain\u201d \u2014 in other words, that they recognized that what the president had done was wrong, and even criminal. The whistle-blower also recounts that these government officials went to the White House counsel and that there was a \u201cdiscussion ongoing\u201d about what they had seen.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The whistle-blower complaint against Donald Trump, in just a few pages, establishes the evidence for a quid pro quo between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2014 unfreezing aid payments in exchange for investigating Joe Biden and digging into an unsupported fringe", "authors": ["Noah Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Lv50f0KFvEDQRI5.c7ePSg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_opinion_268/388a4ec20489c58299c67565d188df40", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
