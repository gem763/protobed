We\u2019re going to recover now and come back,\u201d said Guardiola after the loss at Carrow Road.\n\nCity won 32 of 38 games last season, losing only twice and they had not suffered a league defeat since their 2-1 reverse to Newcastle United on January 29.\n\nThe prior season, City achieved a record 100 points, losing just two matches in the entire campaign and finishing 19 points clear at the top.\n\n\u201cSometimes games like this happen \u2013 we had our chances to score but didn\u2019t, so congratulations to Norwich,\u201d said the Spaniard, who felt the scoreline didn\u2019t reflect the balance of the game.\n\nCity, as usual, dominated possession with 69% of the ball and they had eight shots on target \u2014 while Norwich scored from all three of their efforts on goal.\n\n\u201cIt is football \u2013 we had many opportunities today, they had three or four and scored three goals,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe first one was a set-piece we didn\u2019t defend, the second we were caught on the counter-attack and the third came from a mistake, but we know what we are as a team, we know what we have done and we know what we are going to do.\u201d\n\nNorwich\u2019s crucial third goal came after defender Nicolas Otamendi was caught in possession in his own penalty area allowing Emiliano Buendia to square to Teemu Pukki.\n\nIn the absence of injured French defender Aymeric Laporte, who could be sidelined for six months with a knee injury, City featured John Stones and Argentine Otamendi in the centre of defence and they rarely looked solid on Saturday.\n\nWith Vincent Kompany having left the club and not been replaced during the transfer window, City have few options at the back but Guardiola said he had confidence in Stones and Otamendi.\n\n\u201cJohn and Nico have played together many times and been a huge part of what we have done, but Kompany is now in Belgium, Laporte is injured and these are the defenders we have at this moment,\u201d he said.\n\nSoccer Football - Premier League - Norwich City v Manchester City - Carrow Road, Norwich, Britain - September 14, 2019 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola before the match REUTERS/Chris Radburn\n\nCity\u2019s Spanish international midfielder Rodri said not too much should be read into the loss.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s football. It wasn\u2019t a normal game, but we have to look forward. The season is very long, you\u2019re going to have matches like this \u2013 at least two or three,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a 10 as a team. We\u2019re not perfect. The only positive thing we can say is that it\u2019s early in the season. We\u2019re five points behind the leaders, but we need to keep going.\u201d", "description": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola shrugged off his team's shock 3-2 defeat by newly-promoted Norwich City in the Premier League on Saturday saying his team simply cannot be expected to win every week.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430000240&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E02M", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
