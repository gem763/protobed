On Friday night, they held off the Houston Astros, 4-1, in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium and staved off winter for another day.\n\nAs the Washington Nationals stand by, waiting to learn the identity of their World Series opponents, the ALCS moves back to Houston \u2014 where summer still hasn\u2019t departed, with high temperatures in the upper 80s, and where Game 6 will be played Saturday night at Minute Maid Park. The Astros still lead the best-of-seven series, three games to two.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth teams left their pitching plans for Game 6 as TBA, but both will approach it as a bullpen game, with Astros right-hander Jose Urquidy and Yankees lefty J.A. Happ likely to get the biggest chunks of the innings \u2014 perhaps following openers to the mound.\n\nOn Friday night, lefty James Paxton, acquired via trade 11 months ago precisely for moments such as this, delivered a season-saving performance for the Yankees, pitching six strong innings when almost anything less might have done them in, given the dwindling resources in their bullpen. Aaron Hicks\u2019s three-run homer off Astros starter Justin Verlander in the first inning \u2014 a shot that curled and bent and finally clanged off the foul pole in right field \u2014 paced the offense.\n\nThe Yankees\u2019 win didn\u2019t alter the series\u2019 fundamental equation. The Astros still get the next two games at Minute Maid Park, where they posted the best home record in the majors this season. They still have ace Gerrit Cole lined up as their firewall in a potential Game 7. And the Yankees will need more heroic pitching performances over the weekend.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the Yankees\u2019 victory at the very least halted the runaway momentum the Astros had gained over three straight wins and dented their sense of invulnerability.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re up 3-2. We\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat. We\u2019re going back to Houston. But this is a great ballclub,\u201d Verlander said of the Yankees. \u201cI know there\u2019s been some talk about them not playing so great the last couple days. But this team is stacked. They gave me great at-bats in Houston [in Game 1], and they continued to do so tonight. . . . They\u2019re not going to lay down for us.\u201d\n\nAfter a wild first inning that portended an offensive free-for-all \u2014 with the Astros taking advantage of some sloppy play to hang an early run on Paxton and the Yankees smashing two homers off Verlander \u2014 both pitchers settled in, and the game was transformed almost instantly into a fast-moving, mesmerizing pitchers\u2019 duel. Verlander, a leading candidate for the AL Cy Young Award, was particularly dominant after the first, retiring 20 of his final 21 batters, eight of them by strikeout.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was the rare postseason game in which the most dramatic moment all night might have been a mound visit.\n\nWith two outs in the sixth, the Yankees holding a three-run lead and Paxton\u2019s pitch count at a season-high 111, Yankees Manager Aaron Boone emerged from his dugout and strolled to the mound. The crowd of 48,483, anticipating Paxton\u2019s removal \u2014 this being a spot where the Yankees hardly ever extend their starter \u2014 began to rise to its feet for a hearty ovation. But after Paxton convinced Boone to let him stay in, the latter returned to the dugout alone \u2014 to a massive roar.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot said,\u201d Paxton said of the pivotal mound visit. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Do you have anything more left in the tank?\u2019 And I said: \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s go. I want this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nMoments later, left fielder Brett Gardner, his back against the wall, was settling under Robinson Chirinos\u2019s deep drive to end the inning, and Paxton \u2014 perhaps spared by the grace of a de-juiced ball \u2014 pumped his arms wildly as he came off the mound.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was begging it to stay in,\u201d Paxton said of Chirinos\u2019s drive, \u201cand it did.\u201d\n\nThis time, Paxton\u2019s night was really over, but the Yankees still had nine outs to get. Facing the possibility of four games in four nights \u2014 the result of Wednesday night\u2019s rainout \u2014 Boone wanted to stay away from right-handers Chad Green and Adam Ottavino, who had pitched Thursday. That left righty Tommy Kahnle, lefty Zack Britton and closer Aroldis Chapman, among Boone\u2019s most trusted arms, to finish the job \u2014 which they did with scarcely a stumble.\n\nAD\n\nThe Yankees didn\u2019t lose a home series this year after mid-April, either winning or splitting 23 series in a row at Yankee Stadium. But they lost two of three to the Astros here this week, bottoming out in Thursday night\u2019s Game 4, a loss in which they committed four errors and stranded 10 base runners. That put them in the unenviable position of having to face Verlander on Friday night with their season on the line.\n\nAD\n\nSince 2012, Verlander had made four starts against the Yankees in October, allowing a total of four earned runs over those starts. On Friday night, he gave up that many in the first inning. The Yankees ambushed him, with the big blow Hicks\u2019s three-run homer \u2014 on a 3-2 slider after Verlander had gotten ahead 0-2. The homer snapped an 0-for-15 stretch by Yankees hitters with runners in scoring position, dating from Game 2.\n\nThe inning telegraphed the Yankees\u2019 intention to be aggressive with Verlander: DJ LeMahieu slammed his second pitch of the game into the right field seats for a leadoff homer, Aaron Judge roped his fifth pitch to left for a single, and Gleyber Torres rifled his eighth pitch into the left field corner for a double.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI feel like the game was moving fast,\u201d Chirinos, the Astros\u2019 catcher, said of the first-inning ambush. \u201cI should have called timeout and talked to him. That was my fault.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Yankees are trying to become the third team this decade to fall behind three games to one in a best-of-seven playoff series and come back to win, joining the 2016 Chicago Cubs (over the Cleveland Indians in the World Series) and the 2012 San Francisco Giants (over the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS).\n\nThey needed three wins to pull it off, and now they need two. But those two must come in Houston, and there is no room for error. By the end of the weekend, even there, it will be winter for somebody.\n\nRead more on baseball:\n\nAD", "description": "Aaron Hicks\u2019s three-run homer in the first inning and six solid innings from James Paxton gave New York a 4-1 victory.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BlLg6RI3smnw0V-MVAz1mrJ-nhU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ERYJLVXSDQI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
