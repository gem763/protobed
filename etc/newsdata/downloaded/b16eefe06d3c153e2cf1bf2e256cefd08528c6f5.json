(Picture: Netflix)\n\nStranger Things fans love a conspiracy theory so David Harbour\u2019s recent Instagram profile picture change has definitely got tongues wagging.\n\nThe end of season three, of course, saw his Jim Hopper sacrifice himself so that Joyce could close the gate to the Upside Down.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s long been thought that Hopper is not dead because his body never turned up \u2013 and that post-credits scene about \u2018The American\u2019 led to more theorising about where Hopper has been and what he has been up to.\n\nNow, Harbour has changed his profile picture to a piece of fan art he originally shared in July which shows Hopper and Eleven hugging\n\nIn his profile, however, he has flipped the picture upside down and tiled it so that it now looks like Hopper staring at himself and Eleven hugging.\n\nIs Hopper trapped in the Upside Down after all?\n\nDavid Harbour\u2019s Instagram picture has fans raising eyebrows (Picture: Instagram)\n\nThe trippy Netflix series, which has been renewed for season four, closed with Joyce (played by Winona Ryder) sacrificing Hopper (David Harbour) to spare Hawkins being taken over by the Mind Flayer and the USSR.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce the credits rolled, we were given another headache as it turned out someone we know only as \u2018The American\u2019 is being held captive and will likely be the centre of the story when Stranger Things returns next year.\n\nNow all the signs are pointing to Hopper (or Barb!), but one eagle-eyed fan noticed a hidden message in the title credits which quite literally spells out \u2018Hopper is alive\u2019.\n\nCoincidence? Possibly, but showrunners The Duffer Brothers are notorious for leaving trails of telling breadcrumbs in the unlikeliest of places.\n\nMetro.co.uk compiled all the evidence Hopper will be back for season four, and there\u2019s a lot. Stranger Things seasons one to three are available to stream on Netflix.\n\nSeason four is expected to drop in 2020.\n\nMORE: James Bond\u2019s Daniel Craig looks like a man with a mission in new No Time To Die poster\n\nMORE: Ms. Marvel revealed as main character of Marvel\u2019s Avengers video game", "description": "Stranger Things season 4 will reveal if Jim Hopper is dead.", "authors": ["Rebecca Lewis"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/david-harbour-pofile-5037_1570279238.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
