(Image: Gleilson Miranda/Government of Acre)\n\nMaxciel Pereira dos Santos, a veteran defender of Brazil\u2019s indigenous people, has reportedly been shot dead in a remote Amazon town while riding his motorcycle.\n\nThe BBC reports Santos was shot twice in the head while riding his motorcycle down the main street of Tabatinga, a Brazilian city near the border of Colombia and Peru, according to a statement issued this past weekend by the National Indian Foundation (INA), a union representing workers at Brazil\u2019s indigenous protection agency, FUNAI.\n\nThis incident happened on Friday September 6 in the evening, local time, according to Brazilian newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nSantos worked at FUNAI for the past 12 years, where he defended both contacted and uncontacted Brazilian tribes from miners, loggers, farmers and anyone else seeking to seize land in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nAs Reuters pointed out, Santos was reportedly \u201cmurdered execution-style\u201d in front of his family members. Police investigators have yet to disclose potential suspects or a motive, reports Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nThe killing has been described as murder, but let\u2019s call it for what it actually is \u2014 an assassination.\n\nThe incident coincides with rising international concern about the state of the Amazon rainforest, and its unfolding destruction. More than 100,000 fires have ignited in the Amazon this year, almost all of which have been intentionally ignited to clear land.\n\nFingers of blame can be squarely pointed in the direction of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has cut funding for the protection of the Amazon and the prevention of wildfires. The new president has also expressed his support for loggers and farmers setting the blazes while ignoring the rights of Brazil\u2019s indigenous people.\n\nIn its statement, INA claimed that Santos\u2019 was murdered in retaliation for his work at the Vale do Javari Reservation where he protected indigenous people from the \u201cillegal invasions\u201d by hunters, miners, loggers, and others. Vale do Javari is roughly the size of Austria, and it\u2019s home to the world\u2019s largest population of uncontacted tribes.\n\nO colaborador da Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio (Funai) Maxciel Pereira dos Santos foi assassinado a tiros na noite de sexta-feira, em Tabatinga, Amazonas, na fronteira com Peru e Col\u00f4mbia.\n\n????\ufe0f https://t.co/vPtG9lmNpd pic.twitter.com/rHPBzMsyXT \u2014 CLACSO (@_CLACSO) September 9, 2019\n\nIn a brief statement from FUNAI, the agency said it \u201cpublicly regrets the murder\u201d of Santos, and that its president, Marcelo Xavier da Silva, will travel to the region this week, \u201cwhere he will meet with public security authorities, requesting speed in determining the facts.\u201d Santos\u2019 death represents \u201ca great loss to the Foundation,\u201d noted FUNAI in its statement.\n\n\u201cHis death highlights how standing up for environmental and indigenous rights protection can cost people their lives.\u201d\n\nBioethicist Kerry Bowman from the University of Toronto has visited the Javari valley many times, learning about the relationship between forests, biodiversity, indigenous people, and climate change. Bowman personally met Santos several times in his role with FUNAI.\n\n\u201cI respected him greatly \u2014 he was a very brave man,\u201d Bowman told Earther. \u201cHis death highlights how standing up for environmental and indigenous rights protection can cost people their lives.\u201d\n\nBowman said river entry into the Javari valley has, until very recently, been strictly controlled by FUNAI, with its guards permanently posted at entry points to prevent illegal entry in an effort to protect indigenous people and the environment.\n\n\u201cBudgets have been slashed and protection is now minimal and increasingly challenged,\u201d said Bowman. \u201cThe protection of places like the Javari represent not just environmental and human rights protection but also secures a climate shield, which benefits us all.\u201d\n\nSadly, it\u2019s not uncommon for Brazilian activists to be killed. Recent research shows 684 environmental defenders have been murdered protecting the natural world from exploitation. Many were killed in Brazil where 56 defenders alone were murdered in 2017, and Bolsonaro\u2019s election last year could only raise the stakes.\n\nAs Bowman noted that Bolsonaro\u2019s choice of Marcelo Xavier da Silva to lead FUNAI is troublesome news given his far-right views.\n\nHe also has strong connections with Big Agricuture, which the Guardian points out, \u201cthe move effectively puts Brazil\u2019s powerful agribusiness sector in charge of indigenous affairs.\u201d As a taste, here\u2019s what Silva told reporters in July:\n\n\u201cYou want the indigenous people to carry on like prehistoric men with no access to technology, science, information, and the wonders of modernity. Indigenous people want to work, they want to produce and they can\u2019t. They live isolated in their areas like cavemen. What most of the foreign press do to Brazil and against these human beings is a crime.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Bowman said Brazil\u2019s new government \u201crepresents a major shift in views, and implementation of laws and policies in relation to indigenous people and the environment\u201d and that de Silva in particular is \u201ca major departure from previous values.\u201d Bowman worried that it could lead to major development in indigneous areas, which includes protected reserves in the Amazon such as the Javari Valley.\n\nSuch encroachments could lead to more clashes and potentially more deaths. Brazil is becoming an increasingly dangerous place for indigenous people \u2014 and those who seek to defend them.", "description": "Maxciel Pereira dos Santos, a veteran defender of Brazil\u2019s indigenous people, has reportedly been shot dead in a remote Amazon town while riding his motorcycle....", "authors": ["Andrew Liszewski", "Beth Elderkin"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/qggru4ncznfafwaeejoe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
