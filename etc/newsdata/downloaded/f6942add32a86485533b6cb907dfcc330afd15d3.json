They have actually found a lot of jobs for workers in those plants that are scheduled to close, so they feel like they\u2019ve done a lot for the union and the union is saying, 'But we want more.'\u201d\n\nAny agreement between GM and the UAW will set the tone for contract negotiations with the rest of Detroit's Big Three manufacturers, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch has changed since the last round of bargaining between the UAW and GM in 2015, with the auto industry among the hardest hit by the Trump administration's trade war with China and the emergence of new industry competitors from Tesla to Rivian and Waymo.\n\nPerhaps the biggest obstacle is GM's idling of four factories in Michigan, Maryland, and Ohio, which the union has vowed to fight at all costs. Members of the labor organization also want a boost in pay that starts at $17 to $30 an hour under the existing contract.\n\nGeneral Motors employees build a crossover SUV at the GM Lansing Delta Township Assembly Plant in Michigan in March 2010.

In comparison, the average member of the U.S. workforce pays 28 percent, and salaried, non-UAW-represented auto workers pay 20 percent to 30 percent, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\u201cHealthcare stands alone as not only the most costly benefit on a per-hour basis but also the benefit that has the most substantial year-over-year cost increases,\u201d Kristin Dziczek, a vice president at the Center for Automotive Research, wrote on the organization\u2019s website Monday.\n\nGM and fellow automakers are pushing to bring benefits and salary for union members closer to those of non-members.\n\nOn average, GM pays its factory workers $63 an hour, the highest of the Big Three automakers. Ford pays $61 an hour and Fiat Chrysler offers $55. Nonunion workers in the U.S. factories of foreign automakers earn an average $50 an hour.\n\n\u201cIn an era of solidly profitable operations, the automakers are seeking to contain labor cost growth while the UAW is looking to make economic gains and secure its members\u2019 jobs and future income,\u201d Dziczek added.\n\nWith such disparate demands, the specter of a strike looms large.\n\nIn fact, the UAW is already contemplating directing GM janitorial workers to walk off the job this weekend, as the union\u2019s contract with their employer, Aramark, is set to expire at the same time as the agreement with GM.\n\nSlowing U.S. vehicle sales and a federal investigation into a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving the UAW\u2019s top executives, including president Gary Jones, have roiled this year's talks even further.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s putting additional pressure for a strike so that the members say, 'Who are you really negotiating for,'\u201d Lindland said. \u201cThat scandal is actually putting more pressure for better representation, and for the union members, better representation means going on strike and getting a better contract.\u201d\n\nThe UAW has also made job expansion a priority, with the union\u2019s goal of increasing its membership proving a particular point of contention with GM brass.\n\nWhile Fiat Chrysler and Ford have considerably increased the number of union-represented workers on their payrolls in recent years, GM has not followed suit, opting to reduce passenger-car production stateside and increase it in Mexico. GM\u2019s increasing use of temp workers, who receive far fewer benefits and lower wages, is also disrupting talks.\n\nShould contract talks continue to stagnate, a walkout may be inevitable. The labor action would likely be short-term, though, and wouldn't affect potential car buyers.\n\n\u201cRight now we have a good amount of inventory at dealer lots, so consumers shouldn\u2019t really feel any impact,\u201d Lindland said. \u201cWhere we\u2019ll start to feel impact is if it keeps going, and suddenly we aren\u2019t shipping vehicles to dealer lots.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "A strike is growing more likely as contract negotiations between GM and the UAW drag on.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/UAW-GettyImages-460316846.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
