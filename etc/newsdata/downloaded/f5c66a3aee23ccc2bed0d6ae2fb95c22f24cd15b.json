Even so, some of basketball\u2019s most politically active voices have demurred on the issue as the NBA maneuvers behind the scenes to quash it.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have blistered the NBA for appearing to accommodate China, uniting over a useful foe for vastly different electoral bases.\n\nAttacking the NBA allows Democrats to criticize a major U.S. corporation for putting profit over principle, while Republicans can blast a league known for its outspoken stances on LGBT rights, criminal justice and gun control.\n\nTrump, who is in the midst of high-stakes trade negotiations with Beijing, also took questions about the controversy as an opportunity to lash out at NBA coaches.\n\nAll together, the common message from Washington has been clear: If the NBA wants Chinese money, it must stand up for American values.\n\n\u201cWe've got enough troubles, enough problems with China, the second largest economy in the world. We got to learn to get along with them,\u201d said Rep. Bill Pascrell William (Bill) James PascrellHillary Clinton swipes at NBA over Hong Kong controversy On The Money: Judge tosses Trump lawsuit over NY tax return subpoena | US, Japan sign trade deals | Trump faces narrowing window for trade deals | NBA sparks anger with apology to China NBA sparks anger with apology to China MORE (D-N.J.), in a Thursday interview with The Hill.\n\n\u201cBut we will not bend over.\u201d\n\nAs economic and foreign policy tensions between the U.S. and China soar, the NBA has sought to expand its lucrative presence in China, where the league\u2019s popularity has skyrocketed throughout the decade.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s quest to capitalize in China ran afoul of the ruling Communist Party last week ahead of a series of games in Japan and China when a tweet from Rockets general manager Daryl Morey prompted a Chinese boycott of the league.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMorey last Friday tweeted, then deleted, a picture declaring \"Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d voicing support for demonstrations against Beijing\u2019s attempts to expand control over the semi-autonomous region.\n\nThe tweet drew an immediate condemnation from the Chinese government, forcing several Chinese businesses and media outlets to blacklist, censor, and cut ties with the Rockets or NBA all together.\n\nAs the NBA sought to temper anger in China, it only spurred more backlash in the U.S.\n\nThe league first responded with a widely criticized Monday statement expressing its regrets to offended Chinese fans, and then enraged lawmakers with a stronger statement in Mandarin condemning Morey.\n\n\u201cThe main issue is that they're trying to have it both ways,\u201d said Michael Gordan, principal the Gordon Group, a corporate communications firm in New York.\n\n\u201cTruthfully, they're making everybody unhappy right now,\u201d Gordon continued. \u201cFor a league that really has been arguably the leader in terms of progressive social issues, the fact that they're not going more full throated on China is why people are so upset.\u201d\n\nA subsequent statement from Silver digging in on freedom of expression did nothing to quell backlash across the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous that the Chinese Communist Party is using its economic power to suppress the speech of Americans inside the United States,\u201d wrote a bipartisan group of eight lawmakers in a Wednesday letter to Silver.\n\n\u201cIt is also outrageous that the NBA has caved to Chinese government demands for contrition.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers urged Silver to suspend the NBA\u2019s activities in China until Beijing ends its boycott of the Rockets, one day before the league kicked off a series of games in Shanghai and Shenzhou.\n\nThe conflict has emboldened some China hawks to push for greater restraints on U.S. commerce and involvement in the country.\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who has fiercely criticized Silver, declared China \u201cthe greatest threat we face in the next century\u201d in a Wednesday op-ed for the Miami Herald. He urged \u201cAmericans to understand that when they buy products made in China, they are supporting a Communist, a human-rights violator.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s been little movement behind legislation or efforts to curb Beijing\u2019s censorial behavior, even as Trump expands economic penalties on China for its oppression of Muslim minority groups.\n\n\u201cMaybe people just presume that of course China\u2019s the bad guy here,\u201d said James Carafano, a former Trump transition official and fellow at the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s a fair question,\u201d Carafano continued. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we really be complaining about Chinese behavior, because we talk about [intellectual property] theft, and non-tariff barriers and unfair practices, but essentially China is bullying a company.\u201d\n\nTrump and several Republicans have instead focused on the relative silence on the issue from NBA players and coaches known to rebuke the president and his policies. The president singled out Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr and San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich, two prominent critics of his, for their evasive answers about China.\n\n\"They have to work out their own situation. The NBA is, they know what they\u2019re doing,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"But I watched the way that, like, Kerr and Popovich and some of the others were pandering to China. And yet to our own country, it\u2019s like they don\u2019t respect it.\"\n\nTrump met Friday at the White House with a Chinese delegation as part of the second-day of trade negotiations. The issue of Hong Kong has loomed over talks, but the president has been reluctant to use bipartisan frustration over the issue to cajole Beijing on trade.\n\nHe has been muted in his support for the protesters, commenting on their \u201ctremendous signage\u201d but largely avoiding their basic demands. CNN reported that he told Chinese President Xi Jinping during a call in June that he would keep quiet about the Hong Kong protests while trade talks were ongoing.\n\nTrump sat across from Vice Premier Liu He on Friday in the Oval Office and announced an agreement on \u201cphase one\u201d on a trade agreement. He told reporters that the two discussed Hong Kong prior to the announcement and suggested tensions there had \u201ctoned down\u201d even as demonstrations persist.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s going to take care of itself,\u201d Trump said of the dispute. \u201cI actually think this deal is a great deal for the people of Hong Kong to see what happened. I think this is a very positive thing for Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nWhile China has taken some steps to tone down the controversy at home, the NBA\u2019s efforts to ease its anger have only drawn more attention to the issue.\n\nThe league was forced to apologize Thursday to a CNN journalist after an NBA spokeswoman shut down her question to two Houston Rockets players about whether they\u2019d refrain from speaking out on politics due to the controversy.", "description": "President Trump and lawmakers in both parties have focused their ire on the NBA, not China, amid this week\u2019s spat over Hong Kong protesters and freedom of speech, boosting pressure on the league to defy Beijing's attempts to stifle criticism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/chineseflagnba_10112019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
