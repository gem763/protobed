Now, though, it seems another HBO show is on its way to TV\u2019s big league: the bolshie yet biting thriller Succession, which follows a string of morally misguided media scions somewhere between the Trumps, the Murdochs and Tatler.\n\nThe show is full of 2019 hallmarks, from fake news and corruption to \u201cstealth wealth\u201d dressing (wearing deceptively plain, inexpensive clothing). With a second season that notched the tension up week on week \u2013 and was sealed with a twist in a finale that aired in the UK on Monday \u2013 the show has gained serious ground, and looks as though it could be the next \u201cevent TV\u201d hit.\n\nAlthough its ratings aren\u2019t on a par with those afforded to Jon Snow and co, Jesse Armstrong\u2019s series is steadily building its fanbase, with 1.2 million viewers tuning into its season two premiere in the US, a 32% rise since its season one finale. That is some way off the 11.6 million viewers season two of GoT was averaging an episode across all platforms, but Succession is clearly on the up: like GoT, it received two Emmys for its second season (albeit with slightly fewer nominations).\n\nThe Succession team took home gongs for outstanding writing and for the show\u2019s theme music, by the composer Nicholas Britell (another reason to take note: it has racked up 400,000 plays and counting on YouTube, launched umpteen memes and prompted an official remix by the rapper Pusha T). Compared with GoT, it is a clear win; the first celeb collaboration in Westeros was the Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody.\n\nYet the main quality that gives Succession big GoT potential is its brilliance. The second season finale \u2013 which saw loose ends made looser, family loyalties tested and Logan Roy (Brian Cox) choose a \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d \u2013 was perhaps the equivalent of GoT\u2019s Red Wedding, a high-point for drama but also maybe the last time to get on the bandwagon before this show goes into overdrive. With season three already commissioned, let\u2019s just hope Logan doesn\u2019t invite Ed Sheeran on his next yacht trip.", "description": "After an Emmy award-winning second season and with an ever-growing fanbase, the gripping HBO drama could be about to hit TV\u2019s big league", "authors": ["Hannah J Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ae551e0e40effa009124cf6c56c9a4292629130/589_782_9590_5756/master/9590.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=40e77aae1c0c33686a8704495e4c9d7f", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
