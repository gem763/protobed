Another candidate venue had been Mackinac Island in Michigan. The event is scheduled for next June 10-12.\n\nTrump said at the August summit next year\u2019s event should be staged at his Miami-area resort \u2014 a suggestion that later drew a House inquiry.\n\n\u201c[The G7 nations] love the location of the hotel,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWe haven\u2019t found anything that\u2019s even close to competing with it. Really, you can be there in a matter of minutes after you land.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to make any money. I don\u2019t want to make money. I don\u2019t care about money. I think it\u2019s just a great place to be.\u201d\n\nMulvaney downplayed the notion Trump will benefit financially from hosting the summit.\n\n\u201cI was aware of the political criticism,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t\u2019 profit from being [president],\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons he\u2019s not taken a salary since he\u2019s been here. He\u2019s given that salary to charity.\u201d\n\nThe chief of staff added the resort offered to host at a much less expensive rate than other potential sites \u2014 nearly 50 percent less.\n\nThe United States last hosted the G7 summit in 2012 at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland.\n\nMulvaney also advocated Trump\u2019s suggestion in August to readmit Russia to the Group of Seven \u2014 which now includes the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, plus the European Union.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it better to have them inside as part of the discussion?\u201d he asked.\n\nRussia was expelled from the group after it annexed Crimea in 2014.", "description": "Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters Trump National Doral has been chosen to host the event.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-514040260-e1571335240231-638x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
