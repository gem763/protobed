No U.S. troops were killed in the operation, Trump said.\n\nThe death of al-Baghdadi marked a major milestone in the fight against the Islamic State, which brutalized swaths of Syria and Iraq and sought to direct a global terrorism campaign from a self-declared \u201ccaliphate.\u201d A years-long campaign by American and allied forces led to the recapture of the group\u2019s territorial holding, but its violent ideology has continued to inspire attacks.\n\nAs U.S. forces bore down on al-Baghdadi, he fled into a \u201cdead-end\u201d tunnel with three of his children, Trump said, and detonated a suicide vest. \u201cHe was a sick and depraved man, and now he\u2019s gone,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward.\u201d Al-Baghdadi\u2019s identity was positively confirmed by a DNA test conducted onsite, Trump said.\n\nTrump had teased a major announcement late Saturday, tweeting: \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d By the morning, he was thanking Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, as well as Kurdish fighters in Syria for their support.\n\nThe operation marks a significant foreign-policy success for Trump, coming at one of the lowest points in his presidency as he is mired in impeachment proceedings and facing widespread Republican condemnation for his Syria policy.\n\nAssociated Press With a chandelier in the foreground, President Donald Trump fields a reporter\u2019s question Sunday.\n\nThe recent pullback of U.S. troops he ordered from northeastern Syria raised a storm of bipartisan criticism in Washington that the militant group could regain strength after it had lost vast stretches of territory it had once controlled. Trump said the troop pullout \u201chad nothing to do with this.\u201d\n\nPlanning for the operation began two weeks ago, Trump said, after the U.S. gained unspecified intelligence on al-Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts. Eight military helicopters flew for more than an hour over territory controlled by Russian and Syrian forces, Trump said, before landing under gunfire at the compound.\n\nTrump vividly described the raid and took questions from reporters for more than 45 minutes Sunday. He said U.S. forces breached the walls of the building because the doors were booby-trapped and chased al-Baghdadi into the tunnel, which partially collapsed after al-Baghdadi detonated the suicide vest. Trump also revealed that U.S. forces spent roughly two hours on the ground collecting intelligence.\n\nTrump said he watched the operation from the White House Situation room as it played out live \u201cas though you were watching a movie.\u201d He suggested he may order the release of the video so that the world knows al-Baghdadi did not die of a hero and spent his final moments \u201ccrying, \u201cwhimpering\u201d and \u201cscreaming.\u201d\n\nTrump said he teased the announcement as soon as American forces landed safely in a third country. He said he did not inform such lawmakers on Capitol Hill as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ahead of the raid, saying he was fearful of leaks.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said the mission was to capture or kill the IS leader. While Trump had initially said no Americans were injured, Esper said two service members suffered minor injuries but have already returned to duty. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said a military dog chasing al-Baghdadi was seriously wounded by an explosive blast.\n\nIn his freewheeling appearance Sunday, Trump suggested that the killing of al-Baghdadi was more significant than the 2011 operation ordered by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, that killed al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Trump later repeated a false claim made previously that he had predicted the threat posed by bin Laden in a book before the 2001 attacks, while \u201cno one\u201d was aware of bin Laden threat.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s presence in the village, a few kilometers from the Turkish border, was surprising, even if some IS leaders are believed to have fled to Idlib after losing their last sliver of territory in Syria to U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in March.\n\nAssociated Press Stillf rame from video posted on militant website purports to show Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an on-camera interview with the ISIS media outlet Al-Furqan.\n\nIraqi officials said Sunday they passed information that helped ascertain al-Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts to the U.S. from the wife of an Iraqi aide to al-Baghdadi, as well as al-Baghdadi\u2019s brother-in-law, who was recently arrested by the Iraqis. The officials weren\u2019t authorized to publicly discuss intelligence operations and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump said the death of al-Baghdadi shows the United States will continue pursuing other terrorist leaders and that none should rest easy. \u201cThese savage monsters will not escape their fate,\u201d he said and that the \u201closers\u201d who worked for al-Baghdadi had \u201cno idea what they were getting into.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said al-Baghdadi\u2019s \u201ccolleagues who are still alive should be worried.\u201d But one counterterrorism expert said al-Baghdadi\u2019s death is not the end of IS.\n\n\u201cCounterterrorism operations, including targeting key leaders, will not defeat the Islamic State, al Qaeda, or any of the Salafi-jihadi groups that threaten U.S. interests today,\u201d said Katherine Zimmerman of the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cCounterterrorism must be part of the strategy, but reducing the strategy to just special operations raids and drone targeting, as this administration seems to want to, guarantees a forever war.\u201d\n\nUnder his leadership, the group became known for macabre massacres and beheadings \u2014 often posted online on militant websites \u2014 and a strict adherence to an extreme interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nAl-Baghdadi had led IS \u2014 known variously as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh \u2014 for the last five years, presiding over its ascendancy as it cultivated a reputation for beheadings and attracted tens of thousands of followers to a sprawling and self-styled caliphate in Iraq and Syria. He remained among the few IS commanders still at large despite multiple claims in recent years about his death and even as his so-called caliphate dramatically shrank, with many supporters who joined the cause either imprisoned or jailed.\n\nHis exhortations were instrumental in inspiring terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe and in the United States. Shifting away from the airline hijackings and other mass-casualty attacks that came to define al Qaeda, al-Baghdadi and other IS leaders supported smaller-scale acts of violence that would be harder for law enforcement to prepare for and prevent.\n\nThey encouraged jihadists who could not travel to the caliphate to kill where they were, with whatever weapon they had at their disposal. In the U.S., multiple extremists have pledged their allegiance to al-Baghdadi on social media, including a woman who along with her husband committed a 2015 massacre at a holiday party in San Bernardino, California.\n\nWith a $25 million U.S. bounty on his head, al-Baghdadi was far less visible in recent years, releasing only sporadic audio recordings, including one just last month in which he called on members of the extremist group to do all they could to free IS detainees and women held in jails and camps.\n\nThe purported audio was his first public statement since last April, when he appeared in a video for the first time in five years. In that video, which included images of the extremist leader sitting in a white room with three others, al-Baghdadi praised Easter Day bombings that killed more than 250 people and called on militants to be a \u201cthorn\u201d against their enemies.\n\nIn 2014, he was a black-robed figure delivering a sermon from the pulpit of Mosul\u2019s Great Mosque of al-Nuri, his only known public appearance. He urged Muslims around the world to swear allegiance to the caliphate and obey him as its leader.\n\n\u201cIt is a burden to accept this responsibility to be in charge of you,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cI am not better than you or more virtuous than you. If you see me on the right path, help me. If you see me on the wrong path, advise me and halt me. And obey me as far as I obey God.\u201d\n\nAl-Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq, and adopted his nom de guerre early on. Because of anti-U.S. militant activity, he was detained by U.S. forces in Iraq and sent to Bucca prison in February 2004, according to IS-affiliated websites.\n\nHe was released 10 months later, after which he joined the al Qaeda branch in Iraq of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He later assumed control of the group, known at the time as the Islamic State of Iraq.\n\nAfter Syria\u2019s civil war erupted in 2011, al-Baghdadi set about pursuing a plan for a medieval-style Islamic State, or caliphate. He merged a group known as the Nusra Front, which initially welcomed moderate Sunni rebels who were part of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad, with a new one known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Al Qaeda\u2019s central leadership refused to accept the takeover and broke with al-Baghdadi.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s fighters captured a contiguous stretch of territory across Iraq and Syria, including key cities, and in June 2014, it announced its own state \u2014 or caliphate. Al-Baghdadi became the declared caliph of the newly renamed Islamic State group.\n\nUnder his leadership, the group became known for macabre massacres and beheadings \u2014 often posted online on militant websites \u2014 and a strict adherence to an extreme interpretation of Islamic law.", "description": "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the shadowy leader of the Islamic State group who presided over its global jihad and became arguably the world\u2019s most wanted man, was...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU071_trump__ZG_20191027114351.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
