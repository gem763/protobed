It\u2019s also home to the newest Second Amendment Sanctuary resolution on the books, after commissioners approved the measure Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI put this item on the agenda about this resolution because I feel that some of these socialist gun-takers that are getting elected or trying to be elected are trying to take some of our guns now and more later,\u201d Precinct 1 Commissioner George Conley said. \u201cThey have already warned us that this is what they\u2019ve planned on doing, so we have been warned. It seems to me that it\u2019s OK to have sanctuary cities, but it\u2019s not OK to have a sanctuary county, so that\u2019s why I put this on here to see if we want to step out there and do that.\u201d\n\nThe county commissioners unanimously approved the resolution on a 5-0 vote, but there were some folks in attendance unhappy about the decision.\n\nParker County Democratic Party Chair Kay Parr said in passing the resolution, the commissioners will be declaring that the county does not believe in the law, is unwilling to enforce it and does not believe or support representative democracy or the Constitution. \u201cWhen each of you took the oath of office, you swore on the Bible to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the state of Texas. If you vote for this resolution, you will have broken that oath,\u201d Parr said. \u201cThe premise of this resolution, should the state of Texas or United States\u2019 duly-elected government representatives enact any laws that govern gun ownership or access to guns, the government of Parker County will defy that law.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a really lame argument, and clearly it wasn\u2019t too persuasive, since the entire county commission ended up thumbing their nose at Parr and voting for the resolution anyway. As the resolution makes clear, it\u2019s not about defying the Constitution, but upholding it instead.\n\nThe resolution states that the commissioners court affirms its support for the duly-elected sheriff of Parker County, in the exercise of his sound discretion, and affirms its resolve to support decisions made by the sheriff to not enforce any unconstitutional firearms restrictions against any citizen. The commissioners court will not authorize or appropriate government funds, resources, employees, agencies, contractors, buildings, detention centers or offices for the purpose of enforcing a law that unconstitutionally infringes on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\n\nMeanwhile, commissioners in Smith County, Texas will vote on their own Second Amendment Sanctuary resolution on Tuesday, and the measure is expected to pass.", "description": "Two more counties are joining the ranks of Second Amendment Sanctuaries, and Beto O'Rourke can take a lot of the credit for the growth in the movement.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/50e1d0414955b114a6da837ec32f2a7f1038dce75a58714970_1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
