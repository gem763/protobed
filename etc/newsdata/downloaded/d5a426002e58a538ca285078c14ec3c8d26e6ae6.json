MU, -8.33% tumbled 9.8% in morning trading Friday, in the wake of the memory chip maker's fiscal fourth-quarter report and downbeat outlook, which puts them on track to suffer the biggest one-day post-earnings decline in over four years. The stock's selloff was also a surprise to option traders, which were prepared for a one-day post-earnings move of a little over 7%. The average one-day move after earnings has been 6.3% in either direction over the past 20 quarters. The last time the stock fell more than current declines after earnings was June 26, 2015, when it plunged 18.2%. Micron's stock has still run up 38% year to date, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, -0.40% has rallied 35% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.24% has gained 19%.", "description": "Shares of Micron Technology Inc. tumbled 9.8% in morning trading Friday, in the wake of the memory chip maker's fiscal fourth-quarter report and downbeat...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
