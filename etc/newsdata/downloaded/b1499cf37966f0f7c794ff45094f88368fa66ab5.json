Instead, why not watch a show that tries to encompass all of that and more?\n\nStill, the hosts of the Original Content podcast found themselves split on whether they actually liked it. Jordan and Darrell admitted that they were strangely compelled by the whole thing, but they ultimately found the mixture of gaudy production design, over-the-top melodrama and serious emotion to be exhausting.\n\nAnthony, meanwhile, couldn\u2019t defend the show\u2019s treatment of weighty subjects like suicide, but he was still delighted by the rapid-fire dialogue and \u201cThe Politician\u201d\u2018s apparent determination to entertain at all costs.\n\nThis is Ryan Murphy\u2019s first production for Netflix \u2014 and since the \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d creator signed a $300 million deal with the streaming service last year, the show is attracting extra scrutiny.\n\nIn this case, Murphy created the series with his \u201cGlee\u201d co-creators Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. Platt stars as Payton Hobart, the titular politician, with each season focusing on a different election in Payton\u2019s career, starting with his run for high school president.\n\nThe show mines the gap between the grandness of Payton\u2019s ambition and the triviality of the election for laughs, but that contrast also makes it hard to take Payton seriously at all. And while Jordan and Darrell admire the incredible cast (which also includes Jessica Lange, Gwyneth Paltrow and Bette Midler), they had a particularly hard time with the season finale, which they argue was little more than a trailer for season two.\n\nYou can listen in the player below, subscribe using Apple Podcasts or find us in your podcast player of choice.
