Or New Year\u2019s Day like\u2026 U2?\u201d Well, it\u2019s a bit depressing, that one, isn\u2019t it? You wouldn\u2019t put that one on for a shindig.\u2019\n\nSo then he thought of his genius idea: \u2018This album was gonna be called Achtung Buble. I fu**ing love Michael, but it must stop. It must end now.\u2019\n\nYep sorry Robbie, but you\u2019re definitely the Grinch right now. But perhaps there\u2019s room for both to rule our Christmas playlists?\n\nRobbie is certainly making a good effort as The Christmas Present will boast 28 tracks and a host of pretty impressive collaborations.\n\nThe Christmas Present is out in November\n\nSir Rod Stewart, Bryan Adams and Jamie Cullum are among the stars to duet with the popstar. But there\u2019s none more surprising than boxer Tyson Fury who has teamed up with Robbie on the song Bad Sharon, which is about a drunken office party.\n\nPoor Sharon is about to have all the tea spilled about her antics.\n\nIn a statement about the record, Robbie said: \u2018I\u2019m beyond excited to announce my first ever Christmas album.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve done a lot in my career and releasing this record is another dream come true. Making this album has been so much fun and I can\u2019t wait for you all to hear it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds like a treat, Robster.\n\nThe Christmas Present is out on 22 November.\n\nRobbie Williams - The Christmas Present tracklist Disc 1: Christmas Past 1.
