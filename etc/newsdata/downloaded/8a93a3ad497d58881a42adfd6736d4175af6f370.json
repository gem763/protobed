I\u2019d been in South Africa filming Zulu Dawn and got some sort of disease. I looked washed out. When the director Franc Roddam saw how sick I was, he told me to go home, but I was asked back for a screen test. When I heard that Johnny Rotten was no longer being considered for the lead role, I thought: \u201cWell, this is it.\u201d\n\nRoddam had us hang out for a month before filming started. He encouraged the depraved side of our nature \u2013 he was not one for tucking us into bed at night. We wore authentic clothes and were given lessons in how to dance and ride a scooter \u2013 and we got to hang out with some original mods. We were living it, doing all sorts of stuff to get us into the mood. That\u2019s why it looks like we aren\u2019t acting.\n\nWe shot the end of the film first, at Beachy Head. Riding along the clifftop, I got a lot closer to the edge than I was meant to and fell off the scooter a couple of times. I remember the first assistant director, Ray Corbett, telling me: \u201cListen, it\u2019s the third day. If you fell off that cliff, d\u2019you know what would have happened? They would have recast you tomorrow.\u201d\n\nJimmy\u2019s not a hero, he\u2019s just a normal boy next door, and that\u2019s what makes him work. He ultimately rejects the whole ethos of being a mod \u2013 making your whole life revolve around sitting on a silly scooter. In the end, he had to jack it in to move on. He couldn\u2019t take it any further.\n\nQuadrophenia\u2019s a difficult one to live down. Over the years, it\u2019s filled me with horror \u2013 and joy. At the time, a friend warned me: \u201cIf it\u2019s a hit, they may only ever remember you as Jimmy.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It was frightening. I got knocked to the floor\u2019 \u2026 Leslie Ash and Phil Daniels on their big day out.

I was 17 and a bit of an airhead, so I didn\u2019t appreciate what a remarkable crew we had working on the film. It was a fairly small unit and there was not much of a budget, but we couldn\u2019t have asked for a better director in Franc.\n\nThey\u2019d asked scooter clubs and mods from all over the country to come down for the Brighton part of filming. The moment we walked out of the hotel to start shooting, we saw all these scooters and hordes of mods lined up against the seafront. It was amazing. Filming the riot sequences was really scary. It was supposed to be staged but it was chaos, with police and members of the public getting involved. It was like a real riot \u2013 health and safety didn\u2019t come into it at the time. When Franc shouted \u201cAction!\u201d everyone started running. They made sure Phil and I were at the front so that we didn\u2019t get trampled on, but it was so frightening. I actually got knocked to the floor.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sting with scooterists at Brighton seafront.

There were no Winnebagos in those days and we all used to huddle together in someone\u2019s car or a shopfront. If you look at the pictures of me during the Brighton shoot, I\u2019m sitting on the beach wearing a coat with woolly gloves on and smoking a fag. We worked from eight in the morning right to about midnight. I think I was paid about \u00a3500. The film company really got their money\u2019s worth.\n\nAt the screen test I was just given a story outline, but when I saw the full script I was devastated because there was a nude scene. I said: \u201cThere\u2019s no way I am going to do that!\u201d I was quite prepared not to do the film. They gave me a rewrite of what is now known as the famous alley scene where Phil and I were to stage a love-making sequence. There\u2019s been loads of speculation over the years with people saying: \u201cOh, apparently they really did it.\u201d Well, I can honestly say, no, nothing happened \u2013 it was all acting. It\u2019s just a bit embarrassing to watch. It\u2019s the only sex scene I\u2019ve seen where both actors are fully clothed.\u201d\n\nInterviews by Simon Wells, author of The Making of Quadrophenia, published by Omnibus Press \u00a320.
