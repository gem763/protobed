(Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nChina said Thursday its trade representatives will fly to Washington in early October to resume negotiations with the United States, raising the possibility that both sides might arrest a recent deterioration in the bilateral relationship that has cast a shadow over the world economy.\n\nChina\u2019s top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, agreed to the October visit in a phone call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, China\u2019s commerce ministry said in a statement. It added that \u201cserious\u201d mid-level discussions will begin in mid-September to prepare for the October visit.\n\nThe announcement marks the first sign that talks are getting back on track after both governments raised tariffs last month and engaged in a rhetorical back-and-forth that underscored the adversarial mood settling over the two capitals on a range of issues extending well beyond trade. At one point, President Trump ordered American companies to leave China.\n\n\n\nThe October talks \u2014 the 13th round of dialogue \u2014 were previously scheduled for September. Chinese officials in recent weeks have suggested that lower-level discussions with Washington were continuing even while President Trump has fumed on Twitter about China\u2019s behavior and threatened \u201cmuch tougher\u201d actions. New tariffs from both sides went into effect on Sunday.\n\n\n\nIt's unclear whether either side expects significant outcomes from the talks.\n\nIn China, policy analysts, state media and some officials have quoted founding leader Mao Zedong\u2019s tactic of \u201cfight fight, talk talk\u201d to describe Beijing\u2019s willingness to do battle and parley for peace with Washington \u2014 sometimes at the same time.\n\n\n\n[A year into the trade war, China learns to ride out Trump\u2019s turbulence]\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping has appeared to play down the possibility of a swift and comprehensive resolution to the trade conflict. In recent speeches, he has rallied the ruling Communist Party to brace for protracted \u201cstruggle\u201d with foreign adversaries.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi spoke again in martial terms, telling the party to adopt a \u201ccombat spirit\u201d and \u201cbe both commanders and combatants, cultivate and maintain a strong fighting spirit, and have tenacious will and superb fighting skills.\u201d\n\nAlong with the U.S. tensions and mounting economic hardship exacerbated by the trade war, Xi also described the anti-government unrest in Hong Kong as a major political risk. China has accused Washington of fomenting a \u201ccolor revolution\u201d in Hong Kong as part of a broad campaign to undermine the Communist regime in Beijing.\n\nState media and policy advisers have also framed the trade war as an existential struggle. In the Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper this week, two prominent policy advisers compared the trade conflict to the Korean War, which they noted China waged against the United States even though it was poor and weak.\n\n\n\nSeveral research firms, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, this week cut their forecasts for China\u2019s economic growth this year to below 6 percent.\n\n\n\nChina said this week it filed a case filed with the World Trade Organization against the United States because the Trump administration's tariff strategy has harmed global growth, induced uncertainty and posed a long-term threat to the rules-based multilateral global trading system.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nHong Kong leader fully withdraws extradition bill, but protesters say it\u2019s not enough\n\nTrump admits his trade war is hurting the stock market\n\nA year into the trade war, China learns to ride out Trump\u2019s turbulence\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Negotiations are back on, but expectations are low after U.S.-China relations seemed to enter a downward spiral in August.", "authors": ["Gerry Shih", "China Correspondent", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dnop99HyfX2V9Zpf_3N2G0M51gE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FNOLJYWKNQI6TIP6ZJDORVLTYA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
