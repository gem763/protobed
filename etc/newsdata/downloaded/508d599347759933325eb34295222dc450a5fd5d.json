I thought everyone could clearly see I was being sarcastic. Shit!,\u201d Minaj wrote alongside screenshots of various news articles reporting the collaboration.\n\n\u201cNow I have to go to Adele\u2019s studio & steal some files,\u201d she continued. \u201cWho\u2019s in the UK? I got a job for you.\u201d\n\nOmg guys. \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23 I thought everyone could clearly see I was being sarcastic. Shit! Now I have to go to Adele\u2019s studio & steal some files.

And it\u2019s an epic song! Ahh!\u201d\n\nIn September, Minaj essentially short-circuited the internet with a surprise announcement that she planned to pause her music career and start a family with fianc\u00e9 Kenneth Petty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to retire & have my family. I know you guys are happy now,\u201d she wrote in a since-deleted tweet. \u201cTo my fans, keep reppin me, do it til da death of me \u2026 Love you for LIFE.\u201d\n\nShe later apologized for the \u201cabrupt and insensitive\u201d tweet, and promised to elaborate on her post-music plans on a future episode of her Apple Beats 1 \u201cQueen Radio\u201d show. Fans, however, are still waiting for an explanation of the retirement announcement.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t long before Minaj returned to help with the PnB Rock song \u201cFendi,\u201d which also features Murda Beatz.\n\nAnd she\u2019s set to make an appearance on the star-studded soundtrack for the new \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d movie with a track called \u201cBad To You,\u201d along with frequent collaborator Normani.\n\nRumors that Minaj was partnering with Adele on a new song started buzzing this week when the rapper shared a video of herself lip-syncing to Adele\u2019s hit single \u201cHello.\u201d\n\nThe feeling is, of course, mutual between the hitmakers. Adele, a longtime Minaj fan, has rapped her iconic verse off Kanye West\u2019s track \u201cMonster\u201d on multiple occasions.\n\nAdele, a 15-time Grammy winner, is working on the release of her fourth studio album four years. Her previous album \u201c25\u201d soared to the top of the charts in November 2015.\n\nThis article has been updated with Minaj\u2019s Twitter claim that she was being sarcastic.", "description": "The rapper seemingly confirmed that the two hitmakers were working on an \"epic\" new song.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da731ed210000570fad2f77.png?cache=dkpfnxmzc5&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
