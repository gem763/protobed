The SDF fighters lit their area on fire and left, according to reports, and US troops threatened oncoming Turkish-backed forces with Apache helicopters and F-15E fighter aircraft in a show of force.\n\nWhen that failed to stop the forces' advance, the US troops withdrew, and two F-15Es attacked the base in a \"pre-planned\" attempt to destroy munitions and other supplies inside and limit the \"facility's military usefulness,\" according to Col. Myles B. Caggins, a spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, the US's anti-ISIS operation.\n\nBrett McGurk, the former Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS under Trump and former President Barack Obama, tweeted Wednesday that the attack on the facility was an \"emergency 'break glass' evacuation procedure reserved for an extreme worst-case scenario.\"\n\nInsider reached out to the Department of Defense with questions regarding whether the US planned to destroy other bases, and whether the destruction of the LaFarge Cement Factory base was normal operating procedure, but the DoD did not respond to Insider's query by publication time.\n\nRead more: 3 of America's biggest adversaries are now united against the US in the Middle East\n\nThe US does destroy equipment such as vehicles that it does not want in the hands of adversaries and does not have the capability to remove.

Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, submitted a letter to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Thursday requesting more information about the destruction and abandonment of US military facilities and equipment in Syria. In the letter, Pocan referred to Trump's withdrawal as \"reckless\" and warned against \"poor decision-making while withdrawing troops from current conflicts or spending American taxpayer dollars in a foolish manner.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Pocan told Insider that his office learned of the air strike from a CNN report and \"there was not enough information\" about what happened and the decision making around it.\n\n\"This is clearly a part of a snowballing effect of the president's policy in Syria,\" he said \u2014 a policy that has \"no intentionality or organization.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said Pocan's office had not yet received a response to the letter.", "description": "A spokesperson for the US counter-ISIS mission said that the procedure was pre-planned, and reduced the base's military usefulness.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da8f72dcc4a0a0829332544?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
