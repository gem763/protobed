This game features an intriguing matchup between LSU\u2019s high-powered offense and Florida\u2019s suffocating defense. LSU leads all Football Bowl Subdivision teams in points per game (54.6) and ranks second in yards per game (571). Florida is tied for third in sacks (26), fifth in scoring defense (9.5) and 10th in total defense (276.3).\n\nMATCHUP OF THE WEEK\n\nMississippi running game vs. Missouri run defense: In all honesty, the most interesting matchup of the week is the previously mentioned one between LSU\u2019s offense and Florida\u2019s defense. But Ole Miss\u2019 attempt to run the ball against Missouri\u2019s stout run defense also is well worth watching. Ole Miss ranks second in the SEC in rushing and has run for a total of 692 yards over the last two weeks. The Rebels\u2019 diverse rushing attack features Scottie Phillips (103 carries, 451 yards, 5 TDs), Jerrion Ealy (36-294-3), Snoop Conner (33-245-1) and quarterback John Rhys Plumlee (50-327-2). Missouri ranks 12th nationally in run defense and is allowing just 2.8 yards per carry. That Missouri defense will face a challenge keeping up that pace without injured linebacker Cale Garrett, the Tigers\u2019 leading tackler.\n\nNUMBERS GAME\n\nAlabama owns an 84-11 record when playing as the nation\u2019s top-ranked team over the last 51 years. Alabama\u2019s game Saturday at No. 24 Texas A&M; will mark the Crimson Tide\u2019s first game since taking over the No. 1 ranking on Sept. 29. \u2026 Texas A&M; will become the fifth team to face a top-ranked team twice in one season since the first AP Top 25 was released in 1936. The Aggies lost 24-10 to Clemson on Sept. 7 when the Tigers were ranked No. 1. \u2026 No. 3 Georgia has allowed only one sack and no touchdown runs all season. \u2026 South Carolina is averaging 6.1 yards per carry and 6.1 yards per pass attempt this season.\n\nUPSET WATCH\n\nAfter leading No. 3 Georgia for most of the first half last week before eventually falling 43-14, Tennessee is a seven-point underdog at home against Mississippi State. If the Volunteers play nearly as well as they did in the first 25 minutes of the Georgia game, they could win this game outright. \u2026 LSU is favored by 13 over Florida, and Missouri is favored by 12 over Ole Miss. Both those point spreads seem a little too large, particularly with Missouri\u2019s defense missing Garrett.\n\nIMPACT PERFORMER\n\nGeorgia kicker Rodrigo Blankenship has been virtually flawless this season in the final year of his illustrious college career. Blankenship has gone 11 of 11 on field goals and has made all 25 of his extra-point attempts. He made a 50-yarder against Tennessee last week to improve to 5 of 6 for his career on field-goal attempts from at least 50 yards out. He has made a school-record 179 consecutive extra-point attempts, 19 off the SEC record owned by Daniel Carson, who kicked for Auburn from 2014-17.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Here are some things to watch during the seventh week of the Southeastern Conference football season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Megargee"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/auburn_florida_football_47180_c0-149-3552-2219_s1770x1032.jpg?a862267a49af8e47459474d54c09bddac1a7c279", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
