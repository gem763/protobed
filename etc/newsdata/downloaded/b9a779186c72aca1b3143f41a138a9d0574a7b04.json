Bush.\n\nThe British singer, 72, told NPR on Monday that he admired the talk show host, 61, for \u201cvery eloquently\u201d standing by her friendship with the former president, 73, despite their political differences.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, what our democracy has become now is that it\u2019s not OK to have different opinions than yours and that is not healthy,\u201d explained John. \u201cGeorge Bush has made a lot of mistakes. I made a lot of mistakes. Ellen DeGeneres has made a lot of mistakes. \u2026 Yes, there were [bad] decisions that he\u2019s made, but that was made by Democratic presidents and Republican presidents. And I admire Ellen for standing up and saying what she did.\u201d\n\nJohn also praised Bush for launching the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003, which according to People magazine has saved over 17 million lives and provided more than $80 billion in funding.\n\nELLEN DEGENERES STANDS UP TO TWITTER MOB, DEFENDS APPEARING WITH 'FRIEND' GEORGE W. BUSH\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH SAYS ELLEN DEGENERES' COMMENTS ON RESPECT 'APPRECIATED'\n\n\u201cPEPFAR came from the Republicans,\u201d said John. \u201cPeople have to remember that.\u201d\n\nJohn added that Bush\u2019s program is \u201cthe most incredible thing a Republican president has done on a philanthropic level.\u201d\n\nHe also shared that while he doesn\u2019t agree with many of President Trump\u2019s policies, he does appreciate that he has continued PEPFAR.\n\n\u201cPeople need to come together,\u201d said John. \u201cThey need to respect people\u2019s views on life. Except when it\u2019s heresy, and I don\u2019t think George Bush is that kind of guy.\u201d\n\nREESE WITHERSPOON AND KRISTEN BELL, SUSAN SARANDON AND MARK RUFFALO AT ODDS OVER ELLEN DEGENERES' PLEA FOR CIVILITY\n\nLAWRENCE JONES ON BACKLASH AGAINST ELLEN DEGENERES: THE TWITTER MOB TURNED ON HER\n\nBush\u2019s spokesman, Freddy Ford, previously told Fox News that Bush \u201cappreciated\u201d DeGeneres\u2019 comments about respect after the star took a stand against the Twitter mob shaming her for sitting next to him at a football game.\n\n\u201cPresident and Mrs. Bush really enjoyed being with Ellen and [her wife] Portia [de Rossi] and appreciated Ellen\u2019s comments about respecting one another,\u201d Ford told Fox News. \u201cThey respect her.\u201d\n\nThe former president's comments come after DeGeneres was photographed sitting next to him at a Dallas Cowboys-Green Bay Packers game.\n\nThe backlash over the pictures caused DeGeneres to defend her \"friend\" on her talk show.\n\nELLEN DEGENERES SAYS SHE'S CONSIDERING LEAVING \u2018THE ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW\u2019\n\n'SOUTH PARK' CREATORS OFFER TONGUE-IN-CHEEK 'APOLOGY' TO CHINA AFTER SHOW GETS BANNED: 'WE COOL NOW?'\n\n\"When we were invited, I was aware that I was going to be surrounded with people from very different views and beliefs. And I'm not talking about politics... I was rooting for the Packers,\" DeGeneres joked. \"So I had to hide my cheese hat in Portia's purse.\"\n\nShe noted that some \"people were upset.\"\n\n\"They thought, why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?... A lot of people were mad. And they did what people do when they're mad... they tweet,\" she told her audience.\n\n\"Here's the thing: I'm friends with George Bush. In fact, I'm friends with a lot of people who don't share the same beliefs that I have,\" DeGeneres continued. \"We're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's okay that we're all different... but just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean that I'm not going to be friends with them.\"\n\n\"When I say, 'Be kind to one another,' I don't mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn't matter.\"\n\nDeGeneres concluded by thanking Charlotte and Jerry Jones -- Jerry Jones is the owner of the Dallas Cowboys and Charlotte is his daughter -- as well as George and Laura Bush for a \"Sunday afternoon that was so fun,\" but added that they owe her \"six dollars for the nachos.\"\n\nFox News' Sasha Savitsky and Joseph Wulfsohn contributed to this report.", "description": "Elton John is supporting Ellen DeGeneres after the comedienne endured serious backlash on social media for her friendship with George W.
