(Robin Loznak)\n\nSierra is one of 15 young people from eight provinces and one territory who filed a lawsuit in federal court today, leading up to a climate strike in Vancouver.\n\nThey did it with the help of an organization based in the U.S. called Our Children\u2019s Trust, which has helped kids file similar lawsuits across the world.\n\nAt the heart of the lawsuit is the idea that the government\u2019s role in the climate crisis violates their fundamental rights.\n\nThe youth, ages 10 to 19, will attempt to argue in court that they\u2019ve suffered \u201cspecific, individualized injuries\u201d as a result of climate change, said Chris Tollefson, one of the lawyers representing the group.\n\nThey will also argue that those injuries have interfered with certain rights outlined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including the right to life, liberty and security of the person.\n\nIn broad strokes, the charter says the government is not allowed to put Canadian lives at risk or negatively impact their mental or physical health.\n\nSierra, who is homeschooled, also works as a farmer in the Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island. (Food:Sierra/Earth Guardians/Vimeo)\n\nIf they win, the youth won\u2019t be walking away with a big chunk of change, Sierra said.\n\nThat\u2019s not the point.\n\nThe goal is to force the government to implement a \u201cscience-based recovery plan,\u201d Sierra said, based on advice from Canada\u2019s top scientists.\n\nThousands of protesters marched through the streets of Vancouver on Friday. (Ben Nelms/CBC)\n\nThe Canadian government is already \"ambitiously tackling climate action,\" said Environment and Climate Change Canada spokesperson Gabrielle Lamontagne.\n\nIn an email, she said a plan called the pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change includes more than 50 \"concrete actions to fight climate change.\"\n\nThat includes phasing out coal, using a carbon tax to put a price on pollution and investing in clean energy and public transit.\n\nEven so, Lamontagne said, the federal government will continue to support young Canadiands who \"are asking their representatives to do more.\"\n\nGreta Thunberg attends a student-led climate change march and rally in Vancouver on Friday. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe government's actions thus far aren't good enough for Sierra.\n\n\u201cYouth and young people across Canada are panicking,\u201d she said, when asked why launching a lawsuit was necessary.\n\nThe government has been \u201ctalking for a long, long time about how climate change is a problem,\u201d Sierra said, \u201cyet they\u2019re continuing to contribute to that problem instead of taking action on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this lawsuit, we\u2019re asking them to take that action,\u201d she said.\n\nWith files from CBC News", "description": "Sierra Robinson, 17, from B.C. explains why she\u2019s one of 15 youth suing the Canadian government over climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/15-kids-vancouver-THUMB.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
