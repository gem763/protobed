A spokesman had no comment.\n\nThe ATO had argued if the arrangement was entered into by unrelated parties, the main price determination method of the contract would be different.\n\nMultinational taxpayers are waiting on the result for certainty related to risk from cross-border contracts with related businesses.", "description": "The case is being closely watched as multinationals look for certainty related to risk from cross-border contracts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3311%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_100%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b5f79752bf114a2c0133475576bec2a8e04675fe", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
