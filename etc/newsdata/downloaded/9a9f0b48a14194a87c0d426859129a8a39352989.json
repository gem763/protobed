I can\u2019t that you enough for this. It\u2019s sending shockwaves. People are getting excited, and it\u2019s cool to be part of this,\u201d Spicer said, noting that he occasionally looks at comments on social media and notices that some are continually shocked that he continues to advance on the show week after week.\n\n\u201cI try not to, but every once in a while I can\u2019t help but look at the comments on some of the social media sites, and they\u2019re like, \u2018How is he still on there?'\u201d Spicer said.\n\nHe continued:\n\nThe thing that I find funny is, it\u2019s the same kind of stuff\u2013 harken back to the last election. \u2018How did this happen?\u2019 And well, it\u2019s because we got out there and we voted. I know this is not even in the same ballpark as an election \u2013 we\u2019re getting real people and real policies \u2013 but it does send a message to these folks that like there are people out there who support the agenda and policies and want to see people do well. And I think it does send a great message that there\u2019s a good amount of support out there.\n\nSpicer alluded to the remarks he made on Breitbart News Sunday a few weeks ago. At the time, he said, \u201cHollywood largely shuns folks on the right. This is an opportunity to show that we\u2019re human beings. We\u2019re good people. We care about the country, that we\u2019re out there.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Spicer hopes his continued presence in the competition makes leftist-dominated industries realize that conservatives have a bigger voice than they thought:\n\nWhen they look at their programming and they look at everything, they may hopefully \u2013 hopefully \u2013 stop to say, \u201cHey this Spicer guy has a lot of support from places like Breitbart, maybe we should start to think just a little or even acknowledge that the programming or even the audience shares that point of view.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope people understand that this is not just about me,\u201d Spicer pressed. \u201cThis is hopefully about really something bigger.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle asked Spicer about Queer Eye\u2019s Karamo Brown, whose sons received death threats after Brown refrained from blasting Spicer\u2019s presence on DWTS. Rather than condemning Spicer\u2019s participation in the show, Brown expressed his desire to have \u201crespectful conversations\u201d with the former press secretary. Spicer said Brown is \u201cone of the really good guys\u201d:\n\nThe thing that is so funny about all of the criticism that we on the right get is, I don\u2019t think you can find an instance where I\u2019m going off about some other castmember\u2019s personal beliefs, and Karamo is actually one of the really good guys I think. I clearly don\u2019t share his politics, but he literally said from the beginning, \u2018I\u2019m interested in understanding more about you and the policies that you support.\u2019 And I think frankly that\u2019s what we\u2019re missing. \u2026 He\u2019s been a great person to get to know, and I think he\u2019s right. I don\u2019t go out there and condemn folks on the left. I disagree with their policies vehemently, and I\u2019m very proud to be a fiscal and social conservative, but I don\u2019t disparage folks on the left. I hope to convince them, and I hope what I can do is go out there and say, \u2018Here\u2019s why being a conservative is better for families, better for business, better for the country.\u2019 But I think we\u2019ve lost it to the point where there are folks that are saying, \u2018Spicer should never be on the show. He\u2019s not allowed.\u2019 That\u2019s insane. The idea that the left, if they don\u2019t like you, they shut you out.\n\nSpicer said the hysterical reaction from many on the left demonstrates a massive double standard. If conservatives engaged in the same behavior and said \u201cdon\u2019t allow these people on television, don\u2019t let them go on shows,\u201d the right would be accused of stifling free speech, Spicer said.\n\n\u201cThe left and the media, they hate it when the media gets bashed and they say this is wrong, except when it\u2019s Fox News or Breitbart,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThen it\u2019s OK, because as long as you\u2019re bashing the right, it\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re bashing Sean Spicer for being on a show, it\u2019s OK. If you\u2019re bashing someone who has left-leaning policies, well that\u2019s an abuse of freedom of speech. The double standard and hypocrisy is sometimes a little too much to swallow,\u201d Spicer continued, stressing that the media need to realize that conservatives have the right to partake in culture.\n\nSpicer told Breitbart News Sunday that he and his dancing partner Lindsay Arnold will be the third performance on Monday night\u2019s DWTS. Supporters can begin casting votes at 8 p.m. EST, but the voting window closes at 10 p.m. Supporters can vote for Spicer up to 20 times\u2013 ten by texting SEAN to 21523 and ten by voting online at ABC.com. Further details are on the team\u2019s website, SpicerArnold.com.\n\n\u201cI know this is not life and death or big deal, but it is great to see people going out there and hopefully not just because they want to see me go on, but because they care about the cause,\u201d Spicer said, adding that he is \u201cvery very honored to continue to have the support folks out there listening, reading Breitbart, because it does send a message.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes everyone go \u2018huh, what\u2019s going on here?'\u201d Spicer added.", "description": "Former White House press secretary and current Dancing with the Stars contestant Sean Spicer told Breitbart News Sunday that conservatives and \"Breitbart Nation\" are \"sending shockwaves\" to both Hollywood and the establishment media with their continued support of his run on the show.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/seanspicer2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
