Eddie Murphy, 58, was named the Wall Street Journal's 2019 Entertainment Innovator and featured in a lengthy interview with the paper published Monday\n\nEddie's interview comes amid a career renaissance for the iconic funnyman.\n\nHe's set to star in a sequel to his comedy classic Coming To America, as well as a reboot of his hit Beverly Hills Cop.\n\nHe'll also be making a long-awaited return to stand-up comedy after forsaking the medium for poorly reviewed and under-performing films.\n\nBut when asked about his stand-up return, Eddie made it sound as if he's only making a temporary return.\n\n'I always wanted to do stand-up one more time. So I want to get that done,' he said.\n\nMore to come: Eddie's return comes amid a well-reviewed performance in Dolemite Is My Name, plans to host SNL again in December, and his long-awaited return to stand-up comedy\n\nFortuitous: His new high-profile projects were just the luck of timing. These things were in development, Dolemite, Coming 2 America and Beverly Hills Cop,' he explained\n\nAs for his recent spate of popular and much-anticipated movies, a lot of it was just the luck of timing.\n\n'With movies, it was like, I don\u2019t want the last movie I do to be Mr. Church. These things were in development, Dolemite, Coming 2 America and Beverly Hills Cop,' he explained.\n\n'I\u2019ve been, you know, trying to get them done for 15 years. Dolemite came together and it\u2019s like, \"oh, wow, this is perfect.\"'\n\nThat perfect feeling doesn't necessarily mean there'll be many more movies following on their heels.\n\n'Once I get back onstage, I kind of feel like that\u2019s what I was born to do more than anything,' he said. 'When I get back on the stage, I can\u2019t imagine wanting to do movies again.'\n\nBack at it: Eddie's new Dolemite Is My Name has been called a return to form by critics and is a return to the smart yet raunchy films that he made his name with\n\nNo more films? 'Once I get back onstage, I kind of feel like that\u2019s what I was born to do more than anything,' he said. 'When I get back on the stage, I can\u2019t imagine wanting to do movies again'\n\nToo much work: The Trading Places star claimed that the long hours and hard work of making movies made him hesitant to keep going\n\nMurphy's less-positive view of filmmaking stemmed from the rigorous requirements and time-consuming nature of the art form.\n\n'What I like to do more than anything is just be home with my family, chilling. It\u2019s really easy to feel like you\u2019re working when you make a movie,' he said. 'You\u2019ve got to get up at five, six in the morning. I started making movies when I was 20 years old, when I made 48 Hrs.. That\u2019s f***ing 38 years.\n\n'You\u2019ve been on a movie set, you see how this s*** is. It\u2019s not a fun process. Once I get back onstage again, I want to do whatever, be funny \u2014 I can do that whenever I want to,' he added.\n\nEddie's newest film, Dolemite Is My Name, stars the comedian as Rudy Ray Moore, the cult comedian who starred in a series of blaxploitation films based on a tough-talking, braggadocious character Dolemite.\n\n'When I see Rudy Ray Moore, it\u2019s how audacious he was. How edgy. That\u2019s what stuck out most,' he explained.\n\nNot scared: Eddie wasn't fazed when asked about 'woke' challenges to stand-up. 'It was always like that... People would talk s***, get bent out of shape. I had to apologize for stuff. And that was, you know, 30 years ago. Now everybody gets treated the same way'\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize winner also delved into the changing nature of stand-up comedy and addressed the so-called 'woke people versus stand-up' dynamic.\n\n'It was always like that... People would talk s***, get bent out of shape. I had to apologize for stuff. And that was, you know, 30 years ago,' he said.\n\n'Now everybody gets treated the same way. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m looking at it like, \u201cOh, now I don\u2019t know if I can do stand-up because it\u2019s changed.\u201d It\u2019s like, it changed for everyone else. That\u2019s the way it always was for me.\n\n'The difference is now I\u2019m sitting and seeing how s*** is. So when I put my stuff together, I ain\u2019t stepping on nobody\u2019s toes, giving nobody reasons to picket me and all that s***,' he added.\n\nWeary but confident: 'I\u2019m curious to see what happens when I put it all together and get onstage. I hope to live up to everybody\u2019s expectations. Whatever it is, it\u2019s going to be me'\n\nAfter claiming that he wants to take his new stand-up material to the biggest venues and across the globe, the Trading Places star concluded by addressing the sky-high expectations for his new jokes.\n\n'Everybody\u2019s got this expectation. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going to come out. I know I\u2019m still the same dude. I\u2019m still the same person. I\u2019m older, and I\u2019ve changed the way people change when you get older,' he said.\n\n'But whatever mechanism made me funny, how I come up with jokes \u2014 I\u2019ll be at the house and funny s*** still comes out of my mouth.\n\n'I\u2019m curious to see what happens when I put it all together and get onstage. I hope to live up to everybody\u2019s expectations. Whatever it is, it\u2019s going to be me.'\n\nEddie will host NBC's Saturday Night Live on December 21.", "description": "Eddie Murphy was named the Wall Street Journal's Entertainment Innovator for 2019.
