I'm Rebecca Kheel, and here's your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter.\n\nTHE TOPLINE: The Trump administration is declaring victory after Turkey agreed to what Vice President Pence described as a ceasefire in Syria.\n\nPence made the announcement in a news conference in Ankara. He said Turkey agreed to halt its military offensive in Syria for 120 hours in order to allow Kurdish forces known as the YPG to evacuate. The agreement will also maintain a \"permanent cease-fire\" once the evacuation is complete.\n\nIn exchange, President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP congressman slams Trump over report that U.S. bombed former anti-ISIS coalition headquarters US to restore 'targeted assistance' to Central American countries after migration deal Trump says lawmakers should censure Schiff MORE will lift the sanctions on Turkey he imposed this week and not impose further sanctions, Pence said.\n\nBoth Pence and Trump hailed the agreement as a major breakthrough, with Trump tweeting that \"this is a great day for civilization.\"\n\nTrump also praised Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\"I just want to thank and congratulate President Erdo\u011fan. He's a friend of mine, and I'm glad we didn't have a problem because, frankly, he's a hell of a leader, and he's a tough man,\" Trump told reporters while traveling in Texas.\n\nThe but...: In his own press conference after Pence's, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the U.S.-Turkey agreement was \"not a ceasefire.\"\n\n\"We will pause the operation for 120 hours in order for the terrorists to leave. We will only stop the operation if our conditions are met,\" Cavusoglu said in a separate news conference.\n\nFurther, key questions remain, including whether the Kurds -- which were not part of the negotiations and are feeling betrayed by the United States -- will actually withdraw and whether Russian and Syrian forces -- which have moved into the area at the Kurds' invitation -- will honor the arrangement.\n\nThere are also questions on whether Turkey will hold up its end after Washington and Ankara earlier this year made a deal for a \"Security Mechanism,\" which Turkey broke.\n\nSenators not satisfied: Senators are vowing to move forward with sanctions legislation against Turkey despite Pence's announcement.\n\nSen.

Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioChina's TikTok turns to former lawmakers to help with content moderation policies Hillicon Valley: Warren turns up heat in battle with Facebook | Instagram unveils new data privacy feature | Advocacy group seeks funding to write about Big Tech TikTok adds former lawmakers to help develop content moderation policies MORE (R-Fla.), who said he thinks Risch's bill is the best way forward. \"It is, 'you have a hundred and X number of hours to get out of here before we kill you.' ... Other than giving Kurds a chance to leave so they don't get slaughtered, it doesn't sound like it changes any of the other dynamics.\"\n\nSpeaking from the Senate floor, Sen. Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyWar of words at the White House GOP warns Graham letter to Pelosi on impeachment could 'backfire' Club for Growth to run ads in Utah attacking Romney as 'Democrat secret asset' MORE (R-Utah) slammed the deal and called Trump's decision to withdraw troops \"a bloodstain in the annals of American history.\"\n\n\"The announcement today is being portrayed as a victory. It is far from a victory. Serious questions remain about how the decision was reached precipitously to withdraw from Syria and why that decision was reached,\" Romney said.\n\nEarlier in the Senate: Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulCheney unveils Turkey sanctions legislation CNN catches heat for asking candidates about Ellen, Bush friendship at debate Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump isolated amid Syria furor | Pompeo, Pence to visit Turkey in push for ceasefire | Turkish troops advance in Syria | Graham throws support behind Trump's sanctions MORE (R-Ky.) blocked an effort to bring a House-passed resolution formally breaking with Trump's Syria strategy up for a vote.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerPelosi fires back after Trump 'meltdown': 'We have to pray for his health' 5 big wins in US-China trade pact Trump defends 'crime buster' Giuliani amid reported probe MORE (D-N.Y.) tried to get consent Thursday to bring up the resolution, arguing that \"we're in real trouble.\"\n\n\"The most important thing we can do right now is send President Trump a message that Congress, the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans, demand he reverse course,\" Schumer said.\n\nThe resolution passed the House on Wednesday by a wide margin in 354-60 vote. All 60 votes against the resolution came from Republicans.\n\nUnder Senate rules any one senator can try to set up a vote on a bill. But because that requires unanimous consent, any one senator can block it.\n\nPaul, a libertarian-leaning GOP senator, objected to Schumer's request for a vote, arguing that he was trying to sidestep the Constitution.\n\n\"He should come to the floor and say that we are ready to declare war. We are ready to authorize force, and we are going to stick our troops in the middle of this messy, messy, five-sided civil war where we would be ostensibly opposed to the Turkish government that has made an incursion,\" Paul argued.\n\nIn the House: House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel Eliot Lance EngelOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 House passes resolution rebuking Trump over Syria | Sparks fly at White House meeting on Syria | Dems say Trump called Pelosi a 'third-rate politician' | Trump, Graham trade jabs War of words at the White House House passes resolution rebuking Trump over Syria pullout MORE (D-N.Y.) and committee ranking member Rep.

Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President's personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine,\" he will say, according to a copy of his opening statement obtained by The Hill.\n\n\"However, based on the President's direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region; or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President's concerns,\" his remarks continue.\n\nAt the White House: Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneySondland could provide more clues on Ukraine controversy Tensions flare as Democrats urge consumer bureau to boost penalties White House conducting probe into handling of Ukraine call transcript: report MORE indicated Thursday that the Trump administration held up military aid to Ukraine in part because officials wanted Kiev to investigate unproven election interference allegations linking the country to a Democratic National Committee (DNC) server.\n\n\"The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the things that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate,\" Mulvaney told reporters at the White House Thursday.\n\nMulvaney was referring to unsubstantiated allegations that Ukraine, and not Russia, was involved in the 2016 hack of the DNC server.\n\nMulvaney denied that investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden were factored into considerations about releasing military aid to Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked if what he described was a quid pro quo -- withheld funding unless there was an investigation into the DNC server -- Mulvaney responded, \"We do that all the time with foreign policy.\"\n\nBut hold on...: Mulvaney later walked back those statements, saying that the flow of security assistance to Ukraine was not conditioned on Kiev investigating a theory related to 2016 election interference.\n\nMulvaney issued a statement Thursday afternoon accusing the media of \"misconstruing\" his earlier remarks to the press at the White House \"to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump.\"\n\n\"Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\" Mulvaney said. \"The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\"\n\nMulvaney insisted the only reason security aid was held up was because the administration was reviewing whether other nations were contributing enough and out of concerns over corruption.\n\nNot so fast...: Democrats on Thursday expressed interest in hearing from Mulvaney in person after his remarks.

The deadline for the records is Friday.\n\nDemocrats, though, have not issued a subpoena for Mulvaney to testify in person.\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT - BOEING\n\nH-47 Chinook Block II \u2014 Supporting the soldiers:\n\nThe enhanced capabilities and performance of Chinook Block II will prepare troops of today for missions of the future.

As part of the declaration, Trump shifted $3.6 billion away from military construction projects to go toward the wall.\n\nIt's the second time Congress has failed to override Trump's veto of a resolution nixing his emergency declaration. The House tried, unsuccessfully, in March to override Trump's initial veto.\n\nSENATE TO TRY TO PASS SPENDING BILLS: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellPatient advocates launch drug pricing ad campaign Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 House passes resolution rebuking Trump over Syria | Sparks fly at White House meeting on Syria | Dems say Trump called Pelosi a 'third-rate politician' | Trump, Graham trade jabs War of words at the White House MORE (R-Ky.) is turning the Senate toward trying to pass a set of long-stalled appropriations bills.\n\n\"Congress has fallen badly behind schedule on appropriations. It's been a month since my Democratic colleagues filibustered government funding here on the floor, blocking defense funding and a pay raise for service members. We need to get moving,\" McConnell said from the Senate floor.\n\nMcConnell said the Senate will try to take up two packages of spending bills next week. The first, as an olive branch to Democrats, will include domestic priorities. The second package will include a mammoth defense bill, which is considered a top priority for Republicans.\n\n\"In order to meet Democrats halfway, the first House shell we will vote on will be a package of the domestic funding bills. If we can get bipartisan support to take up that domestic funding bill, we will stay on it until we complete it,\" McConnell said.\n\nAbout the defense bill: The Senate previously tried to bring a mammoth package in September that would have included defense spending but Democrats opposed bringing up the bill.\n\nRepublicans on the Senate Appropriations Committee rejected an amendment to the Senate defense bill that would have limited Trump's ability to redirect Pentagon funding toward the border wall without congressional approval.\n\nIt's unclear if Democrats will agree to pass the defense bill. Leahy said Thursday that \"defense is going to have to wait a bit.\"\n\nOther hurdles: Democrats have been fuming after Republicans forced through top-line spending figures that they felt padded extra money into the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nShelby said Thursday that they had not yet reached a deal with Lowey on the topline figures but their staffs were talking.\n\nIn another hurdle for spending talks, Mulvaney announced Thursday that an upcoming Group of 7 (G-7) summit would take place at Trump's own Doral resort in Florida.\n\nTwo of the House-passed spending bills, covering the State Department and foreign operations and for financial services and general government, included language blocking the use of funds for the G-7 were it to be held at a Trump property.\n\nON TAP FOR TOMORROW\n\nReps.
