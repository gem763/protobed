And its constituent parts, the contributing factors, are many and complex, from the opinions that customers form about your products or services, to the manner in which you interact with your various stakeholders, to your corporate governance and ethical practices \u2013 they all play a role.\n\nReputations are hard won, and easily lost. They are an asset as valuable as any that appears on a balance sheet, and should be fiercely protected. And nowhere is that more true than online.\n\nNow, more than ever, a company\u2019s reputation is shaped by what people see online \u2013 and specifically what they see on the first page of Google search results. Why Google and not other search engines? Well, Google has an 88 percent share of search in the US, so even if you use Bing, nine out of 10 people do not. That\u2019s nine out of 10 customers, investors, would-be employees, legislators, journalists\u2026 everyone you want to influence.\n\nAnd why do we talk about page one of Google specifically? Only 14 percent of people ever look beyond page one, so if we are thinking about where to focus our attention, page one is it. Forget your fancy website, page one of your Google search results is your new shop window. But it\u2019s a window that others get to dress.\n\nWhat you see when you Google your brand name is what others see. And for many companies \u2013 even many sophisticated, mature companies \u2013 it\u2019s not a flattering picture.\n\nBut why is that?\n\nSEO is not enough\n\nMany companies rightly invest heavily in search engine optimization (SEO), but insufficient attention is paid to optimizing branded search results.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: what we are talking about here is not SEO. If SEO is about ranking highly in search against the generic terms with which you want to be associated, what we are talking about here is what people see when they search for you by name.\n\nTry it for yourself. Google your own company and what do you see? If you are happy with what you see, then you obviously have this locked down, which is great. But if not, you certainly are not alone.\n\nMy colleagues and I conducted an analysis of the companies in the Nasdaq 100 and found that 64 of those companies have negative, unflattering or damaging content sticking to page one of their Google search results \u2013 what we\u2019ve come to call \u2018news gum syndrome.\u2019 Negative news stories, poor reviews, activist investors, pressure groups, disgruntled employees\u2026 it\u2019s all there, doing untold damage to these companies\u2019 reputations (and, potentially, valuations).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a lot of that negative content is not the froth of what\u2019s in the news today \u2013 we would expect that. No, it\u2019s old. Some of it very old: 14 of those 64 companies affected had negative content that was more than a year old just sitting there on their search results.\n\nNegative content is sticky\u2026 And some topics are stickier than others\n\nThere are many reasons why negative content is stickier than positive news \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of algorithms and psychology.\n\nGoogle and other search engines do not rank negative content more highly because it is negative, they do so because humans are more likely to click on, read, share, and otherwise engage with negative content. Our brains are just wired that way.\n\nConsequently, negative content just hangs around for longer.\n\nAs part of our research, we analyzed what type of negative stories most affected the Nasdaq 100, which companies and sectors were most affected by which topic(s), and how \u2018sticky\u2019 that content was.\n\nThe bottom line is that many companies clearly lack robust strategies for dealing with the longtail reputational damage caused by these issues.\n\nWho\u2019s managing your reputation?\n\nA lot of this comes down to who is charged with managing your corporate reputation. Your corporate comms team, right? It certainly should be, but our analysis of the Nasdaq 100 suggests this area of online reputation management falls between the cracks between SEO and corp comms. And that\u2019s understandable.\n\nThere are remedies for \u2018news gum syndrome,\u2019 but those remedies require specialist skills that may not reside within either department. So the negative news just sticks around. But it can be fixed. Your reputation is a valuable asset \u2013 it\u2019s time to protect it.", "description": "While many invest heavily in SEO, the importance of branded search results is being overlooked\u2026 and that\u2019s arguably the most important influence on opinion.", "authors": ["Jon Meakin", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/podium?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fdownload.png&signature=6963084af61733015fe8838a424bd3b9", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
