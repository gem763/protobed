The two men, Muhammad Kuchazi and Adamu Usman, pleaded guilty to all the charges on behalf of the company.\n\nThe men, both Nigerians, were not personally charged and freely left the court.\n\nWhile Kuchazi was listed in British court documents as a representative of P&ID in 2009, it was unclear if either man was currently employed by the company. They could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe EFCC described Kuchazi as commercial director, and Usman as director of the company\u2019s local subsidiary.\n\nP&ID has previously described the EFCC\u2019s investigation as a \u201cshow trial\u201d.\n\nP&ID was set up to execute a 2010 deal with the Nigerian government to build and operate a gas-processing plant in the southeastern port city of Calabar. When the deal collapsed, P&ID took the government to arbitration, eventually winning a $6.6 billion award that has been accruing interest since 2013.\n\nLast month, a judge in London said he would grant P&ID the right to convert the award to a judgment, which would allow it to seek to seize assets from the Nigerian government to collect the award.\n\nThe government has said the deal was designed to fail, and called the award \u201can assault on every Nigerian and unfair.\u201d\n\nWith interest payments, the sum now tops $9 billion.", "description": "A company awarded more than $9 billion in an arbitration case against Nigeria has been ordered by a court in the capital Abuja to forfeit its local assets to the government.", "authors": ["Camillus Eboh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
