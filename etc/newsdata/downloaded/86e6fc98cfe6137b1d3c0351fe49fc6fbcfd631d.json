Cory A. Booker of New Jersey relied on a similar ploy last month, warning voters that his campaign was going to run out of gas if he couldn\u2019t get a cash infusion.\n\nMr. Booker surpassed his self-imposed threshold and touted it as proof that voters want him in the race.\n\nMr. Castro said that under the rules set by the Democratic National Committee, he is in jeopardy of missing the cut for the fifth debate in Georgia next month.\n\n\u201cMy presidential campaign is in dire need of financial resources to keep going,\u201d the Texas Democrat said.\n\nMr. Castro received positive reviews for his opening debate performances.\n\nBut he faced stiff political blowback after questioning former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s mental fitness for the job in the third debate and was largely an afterthought in the fourth debate this month in Ohio.\n\nMr. Castro barely registers in national polls, and has zero polling support in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
