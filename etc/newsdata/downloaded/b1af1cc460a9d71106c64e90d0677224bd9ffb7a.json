U.S. purchasers invested a total of $424.5 million in the tokens, called \u201cGrams.\u201d\n\nOfficials alleged that Telegram and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Telegram Open Network or TON Blockchain, failed to register their sales and offers of Grams, which the SEC considers securities.\n\nTelegram has said the Grams were currency, not securities, according to court records.\n\nTelegram Messenger first launched in 2013. The app is free and it doesn\u2019t sell ads. In 2017, the company announced plans to work on blockchain systems and cryptocurrency. It sold Grams to investors in two rounds of offerings, first at $0.37 per Gram and then at $1.33 per gram, according to the SEC\u2019s complaint. The launch \u201creference price\u201d for Grams was listed at $3.62.\n\nStephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division, said Telegram failed to provide investors with information about the business\u2019 operations, financial condition or other factors required by U.S. securities laws.\n\nTelegram was preparing to distribute Grams, and their release would have allowed their holders to sell billions of them into U.S. markets, SEC officials said. The company released a beta version of the TON Blockchain in March and recently released the TON Wallet. It had promised to deliver the Grams by Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cOur emergency action today is intended to prevent Telegram from flooding the U.S. markets with digital tokens that we allege were unlawfully sold,\u201d Avakian said.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s action against Telegram came the same day that the Libra Association saw several more companies \u2014 including Visa and Mastercard \u2014 back out of the Facebook-supported cryptocurrency group.\n\nAn updated Telegram terms of service indicated the company may have had plans similar to those laid out by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has said the Libra cryptocurrency could eventually be exchanged through Facebook\u2019s Messenger app. The new Telegram terms mention the Grams Wallet being incorporated into its Telegram Messenger app.\n\nThe Geneva-based Libra Association has said it will not launch a cryptocurrency until it has addressed regulators\u2019 concerns. But two U.S. senators wrote an open letter expressing concern earlier this week about the project.\n\nSteven Peikin, co-director of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division, said that regulators will not allow issues to avoid securities laws by labeling offerings a cryptocurrency or digital token.\n\n\u201cTelegram seeks to obtain the benefits of a public offering without complying with the long-established disclosure responsibilities designed to protect the investing public,\u201d he said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Officials said the company broke securities laws.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/ContentBroker_contentid-31f319aca06f40339f78060f4953e813.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
