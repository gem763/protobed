In a security dilemma that resembles the Cold War, as countries build up their defenses, the world becomes more dangerous.\n\n\"There are strong institutional incentives within national security bureaucracies to stay ahead of others,\" Scharre tells Axios. But chasing breakneck speed can push aside essential research into AI safety and cybersecurity.\n\nThat could result in AI weapons that aren't thoroughly tested, make inexplicable decisions in the heat of the moment, or interact in unforeseen ways with other systems. \"Some of the most powerful [AI] methods are quite alien to human intelligence,\" Scharre said.\n\nBut, but, but: The phrase \"arms race\" conjures images of the Cuban Missile Crisis, while a bigger conflict is likely to play out on the economic battlefield, says Amy Webb, an NYU professor and founder of the Future Today Institute.\n\n\"When we talk about an arms race, we tend to think about the wars that have already been fought,\" Webb tells Axios. \"We're never talking about the wars of the future.\"\n\nAutonomous weapons are one small slice of next-generation conflict, she says. The greater threat: a Chinese economy made hyper-efficient by AI and backed by allied emerging economies that could \"cripple\" U.S. markets.\n\nWhat's next: The U.S., unlike most countries, has a clear-cut policy against using weapons that target and kill people without any human input.", "description": "Rushing to develop autonomous weapons will make violent conflict more likely.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/dEHaSVLGmyPpYzrWJuGalNZrNC4=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/05/07/1557265443423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-08"}
