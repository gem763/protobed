Cash may have taken the picture for it himself.\n\nJohnny Cash had a Deputy Sheriff ID card which was given to him in 1979. It was unveiled this week at the Johnny Cash Museum in Nashville, Tennessee\n\nDaron Hall, left, unveiled a blown-up image of the late musician's September 1979 deputy sheriff commission card. The card authorized Cash to 'execute any and all processes that may come into his hands and to maintain the peace and dignity of the State, and arrest any and all persons violating the Criminal laws of the State of Tennessee.'\n\nThe card is now on display at the Johnny Cash Museum in Nashville\n\nJohnny Cash's Davidson County Deputy Sheriff Commission Card states: 'By virtue of the power vested in me as Sheriff of Davidson County under the laws of Tennessee, I have this day deputized John R. Cash a Deputy Sheriff to execute any and all processes that may come into his hands and to maintain the peace and dignity of the State, and arrest any and all persons violating the Criminal laws of the State of Tennessee.'\n\nThe artifact will become part of the collection at the Johnny Cash Museum, showing some of the many parts of Cash's life that went beyond the music.\n\nStill, 1979 was a big year for the 'Man in Black' in his music career with the recording of '(Ghost) Riders in the Sky.'\n\nHall says he doesn't have evidence of what the deputy work entailed, but Cash believed in prison reform and criminal justice reform.\n\n'Long before it was sexy to say that, he was talking about it,' Hall says.\n\nHe met with multiple political leaders, including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.\n\nHall says the ID was not an honorary gift but came with real power, although he doubts Cash was particularly eager to lock people up.\n\n'I think he would have been more interested in what can we do to help the person that is about to be arrested than to have arrested a whole lot of people,' Hall said to Nashville Public Radio.\n\nThe card will now sit among other Johnny Cash memorabilia at the Nashville museum\n\nCash was never convicted of a felony or spent time in prison \u2013 besides when he was performing for inmates\n\nAlthough Cash earned a reputation as something of an outlaw after spending a handful of nights in jail for minor arrests, Cash was never convicted of a felony or spent time in prison, apart from when he was performing for inmates.\n\nCash was known for performing concerts in prisons and released albums recorded in Folsom Prison and San Quentin.\n\nBill Miller, owner of the Johnny Cash Museum says the concerts left a lasting impact.\n\n'There are probably tens of thousands of people alive today still who were inspired by this great man going into a prison and taking them out of that prison for that three hours that they sat there, forgetting where they were,' he says.\n\n'He was doing it not for his own commercial appeal, but trying to carry a message of \u2014 his exact words, I think, were that prisons do no good if you don't do good for people who are in prison.'\n\nCash's sheriff's deputy card will hang in the museum, among glass cases filled with antique guitars and framed records.", "description": "Nashville's sheriff has presented the Johnny Cash Museum proof that the late musician who famously cultivated an image as an outlaw was actually granted law enforcement authority.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/18/20144768-0-image-a-65_1571937372210.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
