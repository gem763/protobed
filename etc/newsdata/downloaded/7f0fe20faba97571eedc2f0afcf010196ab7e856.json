Nearly all of the top cities are located in California, much like the percentage of adults eating enough fruits/vegetables per day.\n\nThe West Coast also has the highest percentage of physically active adults. This may be why San Francisco took the top spot \u2014 it has the most walking trails per capita and the most running trails per capita.\n\nThe South contains most unhealthy cities\n\nMeanwhile, the unhealthiest cities in the U.S. are overwhelmingly found in the South. Brownsville, Texas, is the least healthy spot in the nation and two other Texas cities made the list, along with two in Alabama, two in Georgia, and two in Mississippi.\n\n\u201cThose states in particular have high [obesity] rates, and I\u2019m sure their physical activity is rather low,\u201d Dr. Charles Platkin, the director of the Hunter College NYC Food Policy Center and editor of DietDetective.com, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cultural \u2026 around food and eating. Probably a more relaxed atmosphere, more rural in some of the urban centers. Hence the high levels of walkability or concerns about healthy eating or concerns about lifestyle. Whereas in those states, they have higher levels of blue collar workers.\u201d\n\nAccess to health care plays a major role in these findings.

Laredo, Texas, the second-most unhealthy city, is among the places with the fewest mental health counselors per capita and the fewest healthy restaurants per capita. It also has a low percentage of physically active adults.\n\n\u201cMy wife\u2019s family is from a small town in Kentucky,\u201d Platkin added. \u201cThey have dentists that come in once a year, medical services, and they set up a health fair. So there\u2019s not a lot of access to medical care like you\u2019d have in a big urban center. I think the rural environment, lack of access to medical and mental care, all of this is probably why they\u2019re lower on the low end of this scale because that was a significant part of it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Eating healthy can ... be a luxury\u2019\n\nSeveral of these states have some of the highest poverty levels in the nation. Poverty plays a bigger role in health than many realize, Platkin explained.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s high levels of poverty, there are more than likely high levels of food insecurity and hunger-related issues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think \u2018oh well, if they\u2019re food insecure and they\u2019ve hunger issues, we\u2019ll all be thin, right?\u2019 No, that\u2019s not the case, actually. It\u2019s counterintuitive in some ways, because you tend to just eat what you can.\u201d\n\nCorpus Christi, Texas, no. 12 among unhealthiest cities, has some of the fewest healthy restaurants per capita and the highest percentage of adults not eating enough fruits and vegetables per day.\n\n\u201cEating healthy can sometimes in the United States, believe it or not, be a luxury and it shouldn\u2019t necessarily be a luxury,\u201d Platkin said. \u201cTo us, when we talk about food and food insecurity, we see the right to healthy, inexpensive food as a human right, but it\u2019s not in a lot of instances.\u201d\n\nAdriana is an associate editor for Yahoo Finance.
