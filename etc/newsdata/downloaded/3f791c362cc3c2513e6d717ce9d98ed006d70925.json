The district\u2019s more populated, suburban areas around Charlotte largely supported the Democrat in the race. Some said the narrow margin by which Bishop won the congressional seat should flash warning signs to the president ahead of 2020, suggesting suburban America is drifting away from Trump.", "description": "A North Carolina high school teacher is being investigated by the Secret Service after allegedly telling a classroom of students that Vice President Mike Pence \u201cshould be shot in the head,\u201d according to reports.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace", "Allison Powers", "Chairwoman", "Union County Gop"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/ContentBroker_contentid-932c1a9b29294b81b3ab20085ed6d1ce.png", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
