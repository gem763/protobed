So I managed locally,\u201d said Shindi.\n\nHe worked in car renovation in the United Arab Emirates for 12 years and has got used to improvising.\n\nHe recently completed a Mercedes Gazelle from the 1920s and is currently fixing a 1946 Armstrong Siddeley Hurricane.\n\nThe Armstrong, he explained, was a British luxury car well loved by car enthusiasts.\n\nBut even during its peak in the 1940s it was not that popular, so original parts are not available.\n\nAs such Shindi repurposes bits from other classic cars, often getting them from Israel.\n\nHis aim is to make driving the car feel as close to the original as possible.\n\nHe bought the Armstrong for around $3,000 from a man who had owned it for more than 20 years.\n\nHe estimates it will cost at least another $10,000 to transform it into a working automobile.\n\n\u201cThe car was empty. Slowly I am working to complete it.\u201d\n\nShindi dreams of travelling outside the strip to show off his cars but knows it is nearly impossible.\n\nIsrael has imposed a decade-long blockade on Gaza, which it says is necessary to isolate the strip\u2019s Islamist rulers Hamas \u2014 with whom the Jewish state has fought three wars.\n\nCritics say it amounts to collective punishment of the two million residents.\n\nEven when the car is eventually purring, which Shindi estimates will take another couple of months, it will not be able to go far.\n\nGaza is only 365 square kilometres, around 25 miles (40 kilometres) north to south.\n\nHossam Ayoub, a neighbour, came to stare at the car.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Vintage cars like this are part of history,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one knows this kind of car here. It\u2019s something unusual.\u201d", "description": "Gaza City (Palestinian Territories) (AFP) \u2013 Munir al-Shindi could not get parts for his classic cars in the blockaded Gaza Strip, so he decided to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/d94e59_munir-shindy-repurposes-parts-classic-cars-restore-old-vehicles-in-gaza-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
