Neither can some members of his own cabinet. Mike Pompeo, for one, is reportedly tearing his hair out at having to navigate Giuliani\u2019s daily Ukraine messaging. Other Republicans are complaining to the media both on and off the record that Rudy needs to shut his cakehole already. It won\u2019t happen today, though: Giuliani is the star guest on this morning\u2019s Sunday shows, set for appearances on \u201cThis Week\u201d and \u201cFace the Nation\u201d where he\u2019ll answer questions about what he\u2019s been telling the Ukrainians for the past six months, whether he ever tried to extort them over U.S. military aid at Trump\u2019s behest, and why he thought it\u2019d be a good idea to give a paid speech to a Kremlin-backed conference in the middle of all this before media scrutiny forced him to back off. He\u2019s likely to make news, and not in a good way for the president.\n\nMaybe Trump\u2019s reason for letting Rudy\u2019s circus act proceed is as simple as him enjoying Giuliani\u2019s relentless belligerence on his behalf. Rudy swings wildly but he always aims his roundhouses at Trump\u2019s enemies. The president surely appreciates that, even when some of those wild punches end up landing on Team Trump instead.\n\nLiddle\u2019 Adam Schiff will also be on this morning, of course, where he\u2019ll chart the path forward on impeachment and try to decipher what the hell Trump was talking about here in explaining Schiff\u2019s nickname. He\u2019s set for \u201cThis Week\u201d and \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The Democrat most worth watching, though, may be freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who\u2019s an interesting player in the Ukraine matter for all sorts of reasons. She used to work at the CIA, just like the whistleblower. She\u2019s one of the seven Democratic freshmen with natsec backgrounds who wrote the influential WaPo op-ed earlier this week endorsing impeachment that ended up finally convincing Pelosi. And she happens to represent a majority-Republican district in Michigan, one that broke for Trump in 2016. By taking a lead role in the impeachment melee, Slotkin\u2019s taking her political life in her hands.\n\nShe also made this interesting comment after Pelosi announced the formal start of an impeachment inquiry a few days ago. An impeachment inquiry is what Jerry Nadler has claimed all along to be conducting, in which case what exactly did Pelosi accomplish? Slotkin doesn\u2019t know the answer to that question and was blunt about it:\n\nMore Slotkin: \u201cWe came out because this is something different, this meeting did not give me confidence that this will be something different.\u201d \u2014 Heather Caygle (@heatherscope) September 24, 2019\n\nShe\u2019ll be on \u201cState of the Union\u201d this morning to address all of that. Cory Booker will be on the same show, no doubt to emote about Trump\u2019s alleged crimes and offer a hint about whether he\u2019ll be dropping out of the race 48 hours from now or hanging in there.\n\nIf you\u2019re already bored with impeachment try \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d where Trump immigration czar Stephen Miller will be on to defend the administration\u2019s new cap on refugees. Expect Chris Wallace to press him on Christian refugees in particular: Trump promised two years ago to give them priority in refugee admissions, but the new cap of 18,000 total refugees annually is so low that only a relatively tiny number \u2014 Christian and otherwise \u2014 will be admitted. Christian refugee resettlement groups have noticed too and aren\u2019t happy about it.
