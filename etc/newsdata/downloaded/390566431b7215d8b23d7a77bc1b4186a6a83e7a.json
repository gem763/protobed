The left is a purely destructive force.\n\n\"Whether it's America or Europe or anywhere else. Liberals and conservatives may differ but they have similar values,\" Prager continued.\n\nDENNIS PRAGER ON WHY NEW FILM 'NO SAFE SPACES' IS UNFAIRLY RATED\n\nHe called the film a \"wake-up call\" to the American people and claimed free speech is being trampled on to satisfy a political agenda.
