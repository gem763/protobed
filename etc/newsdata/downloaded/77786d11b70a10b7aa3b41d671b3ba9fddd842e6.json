Under the second-degree murder charge, Espinosa Cruz could face five to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced Nov. 15.\n\nA Washington Post deliveryman found Ortega lying on a street in a residential area in the 13000 block of Jeb Stuart Square in Centreville shortly before 5:20 a.m. Feb. 14, 2018, Fairfax County Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Kathleen Bilton told the judge in the case. Ortega, a Centreville High student, had suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene. A medicine bottle filled with marijuana was found in his pocket.\n\nResidents in the neighborhood said they did not witness the killing, but some said they heard a shout about 10:15 p.m. the evening before Ortega was found dead, Bilton said in court.\n\nInterviews led detectives to Espinosa Cruz.\n\nEspinosa Cruz, then 18, told detectives that a meeting was arranged with Ortega to buy marijuana, Bilton said. Ortega, Espinosa Cruz and two other people traveled to Jeb Stuart Court to conduct the deal, but an argument ensued, Bilton said Espinosa Cruz told authorities.\n\nEspinosa Cruz told detectives that he pulled out his gun and that it accidentally fired when Ortega put his hands up to block it, Bilton said.\n\nThe two men who were with Espinosa Cruz that night offered a differing account after they were granted immunity by prosecutors. They said the meeting with Ortega was arranged so Espinosa Cruz could rob him of marijuana.\n\nBoth people told prosecutors that they didn\u2019t think Espinosa Cruz intended to shoot Ortega.\n\nW. Michael Chick, an attorney for Espinosa Cruz, said his client was sorry.\n\n\u201cUriel is extremely remorseful for what he did,\u201d Chick said. \u201cHe\u2019s sorry to Matthew\u2019s family for the pain he caused.\u201d\n\nOrtega\u2019s family, who attended the plea hearing, declined to comment.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Uriel Espinosa Cruz, 19, could face up to 40 years in prison in the killing of Matthew Ortega, 17.", "authors": ["Justin Jouvenal", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Policing", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UliUp3J0TpaS4e89DcZTRJaaGqk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHDHKSBL4AI6TEDOTVK3MRI6WQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
