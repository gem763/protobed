The United States has a \"substantial interest in religious liberty,\" the Justice Department says.\n\nJoshua Payne-Elliott is suing the archdiocese, alleging that it illegally interfered with his contractual and employment relationship with Cathedral High School, causing Cathedral to terminate him.\n\nBut in its statement, the DOJ said that the First Amendment protects the right of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis to interpret and apply Catholic doctrine.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how binding the DOJ's statement is, or what impact it will have on Payne-Elliott's suit.\n\n\u201cIf the First Amendment\u2019s Religion Clauses stand for anything, it is that secular courts cannot entangle themselves in questions of religious law,\u201d United States Attorney Josh Minkler said.\n\nBackground: Vatican pauses decree revoking school's Catholic status for refusing to fire a gay teacher\n\nFrom July: An Indiana Catholic school fired a gay teacher for same-sex marriage. Now, a settlement\n\nPayne-Elliott filed his suit in Marion County in July, saying in a news release that he hoped \"this case will put a stop to the targeting of LGBTQ employees and their families.\" He was one of the three gay, married Catholic school employees fired at the direction of the archdiocese.\n\nTwo guidance counselors were fired from Roncalli High School. Payne-Elliott's husband, Layton Payne-Elliott, is a teacher at Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School. The archdiocese stripped Brebeuf of its Catholic identity after it refused to fire Payne-Elliott, though the Vatican recently suspended that ruling pending an appeal from the school.\n\nJoshua Payne-Elliott (right), pictured with his husband Layton Payne-Elliott, is suing the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. More\n\nOfficials with Cathedral said the archdiocese threatened to do the same if Joshua Payne-Elliott's employment continued.\n\nBut Indianapolis Archbishop Charles C. Thompson has maintained that the church is not targeting anyone.\n\nRather, Thompson said, the archdiocese has a right to set whatever rules it wants for its schools and employees, including that they must live according to Catholic Church doctrine. The archdiocese began requiring a morality clause in teacher, administrator and counselor contracts at some of its schools four years ago, and at all Catholic schools two years ago.\n\n\"Religious liberty, which is a hallmark of the U.S. constitution and has been tested in the U.S. Supreme Court, acknowledges that religious organizations may define what conduct is acceptable and contrary to the teachings of its religion, for its school leaders, guidance counselors, teachers and other ministers of faith,\" the archdiocese said.\n\nA statement of interest is described in court documents as a statement that speaks to the interests of the United States in a pending suit. It is not a ruling.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of religious institutions and people to decide what their beliefs are, to teach their faith, and to associate with others who share their faith,\u201d Eric Dreiband, assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, said in a statement. \u201cThe First Amendment rightly protects the free exercise of religion.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. Justice Department filed a statement saying the First Amendment protects the right of the Archdiocese to apply Catholic doctrine.", "authors": ["Justin L.
