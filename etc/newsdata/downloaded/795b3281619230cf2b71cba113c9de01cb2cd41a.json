I could spend the time it takes to watch the entire Marvel film output unpacking that sentence. Jeremy Renner had an app. Jeremy Renner has superfans. Jeremy Renner had an app for those superfans to interact with each other and with him, Jeremy Renner, who inexplicably had an app and also superfans.\n\nThis app has been around since 2017. I can\u2019t even.\n\nJeremy Renner is my favorite kind of celebrity, someone who stars in the biggest movie franchise there has ever been, has two Oscar nominations, and if you stood him in front of me and said, \u201cName this man and tell me your feelings about him,\u201d I\u2019d ask you why you have kidnapped the barista from my local Starbucks. He\u2019s that... meh. There has never been more of an \u201coh, that guy\u201d than this guy.\n\nYet there are people who watched The Avengers and said, \u201cHim. The one who has that bow and arrow and I think is named Johnny? Jimmy? Or is it Jeb? I want to have access to a non-stop feed of photos and messages from him. It would be ideal, too, if I could spend actual money to up my status in this app so that he might see my comments.\u201d And they have been doing just that. FOR TWO YEARS.\n\nThose blissful two years were thwarted this week when Renner announced the app is closing. In a font not used since the receptionist at your childhood dentist\u2019s office printed out a sign stating the bathroom was out of order in 1992, he explained that \u201cthe app has jumped the shark. Literally.\u201d It had been pillaged by \u201cclever individuals that were able to manipulate ways to impersonate me and others in the app.\u201d\n\nWhat was meant to be a safe space for those among us who just wanted to spend some money for the privilege of commenting \u201clooking good!\u201d in a Jeremy Renner-only app had, according to the man himself, \u201cturned into a place that is everything I detest and can\u2019t or won\u2019t condone.\u201d As of Wednesday\u2014Rennsday, the lord\u2019s day\u2014the app is no more.\n\nWhat happened? I\u2019m so glad you asked.\n\nThe Renner app had popped back into the zeitgeist for the first time since superfans alleged censorship and contest-rigging back in its early days\u2014the drama!\u2014as screenshots revealing how absurd the comments section had become started circulating on Twitter. Not only were people pretending to be Renner, they were pretending to be an absurd array of celebrities ranging from Brendan Fraser to Casey Anthony.\n\nThings got real dark over these last few weeks, however, when comedy writer Stefan Heck jokingly responded to a post by Renner asking what everyone\u2019s weekend plans were by saying, \u201cI will be looking at porno on my computer.\u201d Soon fake Renners sprouted up \u201csowing chaos and pretending to like porno.\u201d Real fans were offended by the sudden rise in porn preaching. There was nothing to be done about it. Heck had, as he wrote in Deadspin, \u201csingle-handedly obliterated, uh... the official Jeremy Renner app.\u201d\n\nI love this story so much. First of all, it is all, every single detail of it, patently ridiculous. It is the perfect encapsulation of how toxic internet and troll culture has become, incinerating anything even remotely earnest, such as a Jeremy Renner fan app. It also illustrates just how asinine celebrity ego-driven ventures have become.\n\nGone are the days when your favorite stars would just open terrible restaurants that closed in a year or two. Now everyone is a lifestyle brand. It\u2019s not their name or fame that has value. It is, dear god, THEIR THOUGHTS.\n\nThings have only gotten worse since the launch of GOOP, when Gwyneth Paltrow first peddled aspirational wellness through separate bedrooms, positive sweating, a plate of couscous paired with a shot of leprechaun blood each morning, and indulging in one American Spirit a day, smoked through your vagina.\n\nSince then, Blake Lively romanticized the fashion and style of America\u2019s slavery history, Reese Witherspoon twanged something or another about whiskeys and tea cups, and Catherine Zeta-Jones started a design line that, from what I can tell, suggests that true taste is matching your clothing to your furniture.\n\nNow, Jeremy Renner has an app. Or, had. Porno rennered it obsolete. (Get it!?)\n\nRyan Murphy Is Putting That Netflix Money to Use\n\nThe Netflix era of Ryan Murphy begins later this month with the launch of The Politician, an Election-meets-Succession series starring Ben Platt, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jessica Lange as a bunch of rich people. But in an interview with Time this week, Murphy went into detail on his future programming plans for the streaming service. I am excited and exhausted.\n\nIn addition to Ratched, about Louise Fletcher\u2019s One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest character, and adaptations of the Broadway productions of Boys in the Band and The Prom, he\u2019s planning a 10-part miniseries version of A Chorus Line, a Halston bio-series starring Ewan McGregor, a project centering on Marlene Dietrich starring Lange, a docu-series about Andy Warhol, a documentary called A Secret of Love about a lesbian couple who came out in their eighties, and Hollywood starring Patti LuPone and Holland Taylor.\n\nListen, say what you want about Netflix, the current era of #TooMuchTV, or even Murphy\u2019s output. This thrills me. After a lifetime of \u201che\u2019s a doctor, but cranky\u201d and \u201cthey solve crimes, but with their minds\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re lawyers, but they\u2019re children,\u201d I can\u2019t believe there is this much programming in development that is actually for me . It\u2019s not easy to break from the ranks and risk whether anyone will follow you. I most certainly will.\n\n\u2018The Great British Baking Show\u2019 Is Back\n\nThe most important show on television, The Great British Baking Show, finally returned this week. In times like these, you don\u2019t just want, but NEED a series in which quaint British people bake sponge cake under a tent in the bucolic English countryside. This show is my self-care.\n\nFor the first time, Netflix is posting one episode each week, soon after it actually airs in the U.K., rather than all at once months after the winner has already been announced. It\u2019s as if the service clocked my lack of self-control and knew that I\u2019d need to space out this polite goodness and not devour it all in one sitting.\n\nThere\u2019s something so appealing about the niceness of it all, and its simplicity. There are no smoke machines and flashy production numbers or Jenny McCarthy screaming that she can\u2019t figure out who the celebrity is in a fever-dream version of a hippopotamus costume singing a Sam Smith song. There is no recording contract or modeling deal or even cash prize for the winner. Just a bunch of pleasant people excited to show off, in the humblest of ways, that, hey, they\u2019re pretty good at baking things. It\u2019s all so... nice.\n\nNPR\u2019s Linda Holmes will always have my favorite summation of the show\u2019s appeal: \u201cThere are days in which you find yourself more in the mood for a relaxing evening having drinks with low-key, charming friends than for an hour spent watching a skunk and a rat fight over who gets to drag a rotten potato into a hole in the ground.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something unexpectedly poignant about it all. Sometimes you get a good bake. Sometimes you get a soggy bottom. You\u2019ve got to shrug it off, and move on. It\u2019s just cake. Or, when you think about it, life, too.\n\nI Want to Be Naomi Osaka When Grow Up\n\nI will watch this video of Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff once a day, every morning, until I am sure I have developed even an iota of the grace, goodness, and understanding that is on display. Watch the video here. You won\u2019t regret it.\n\nThe Time Hillary Clinton Finally Broke Me\n\nCause of death: This photo and this caption.\n\nWhat to watch this week:\n\nCouples Therapy: Live your nosy bitch fantasy with this series showing real-life couples in therapy.\n\nThe Deuce: Maggie Gyllenhaal gives what might be the most underrated performance on TV.\n\nA Very Brady Renovation: It\u2019s just fun, people!\n\nWhat to skip this week:\n\nIt: Chapter Two: It cannot be stressed enough that this movie is two hours and 50 minutes.\n\nThe Spy: Sacha Baron Cohen just how you like him...in a serious spy drama.", "description": "Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567778024/190906-obsessed-gbbs-hero_yl4npn", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
