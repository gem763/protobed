And I think there\u2019s so much in Philip\u2019s books about now and where we\u2019re at now, even more than when he first wrote it.\n\n\u2018The thing that I most admire about his telling is that there\u2019s an obvious story to be told, and that\u2019s Asriel\u2019s story, and he doesn\u2019t tell it, he tells Lyra\u2019s, and that choice between following the person intent on greatness, Asriel, and abandoning that in order to follow the person intent on goodness in Lyra is such a bold and brilliant choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And, you know, Greta Thunberg \u2026 Lyra \u2026 there are quite a lot of similarities there.\u2019\n\nJack wrote the adaptation of the novel \u2013 which deeply critiqued religion \u2013 and compared the novels\u2019 authority Magisterium to the current British government.\n\nThe government\u2019s response to pro-environmental Extinction Rebellion protestors, who have recently been demonstrating across London and purposely causing disruption to get the governments attention on climate change, has angered many after they were banned from protesting in London.\n\nJack compared the English government to the religious authority in the novel (Picture: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for HBO)\n\nDafne Keen plays as Lyra in His Dark Materials (Picture: Anthony Harvey/REX)\n\n\u2018We just saw today a protest being removed from the streets without due process of law, and it was done quite openly by a group of people that felt they were entitled to do it, and they denied another group of people the right to protest,\u2019 Jack said.\n\nMaybe now Jack can collaborate with Greta on a life-changing documentary about the environment?\n\nThe playwright was joined on stage by Dafne Keen, who plays the iconic Lyra, as well as Ruth Wilson (Mrs Coulter), Clarke Peters (The Master) and series producer Jane Tranter.\n\nThe first season of His Dark Materials launches on 3 November on BBC and 4 November on HBO.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
