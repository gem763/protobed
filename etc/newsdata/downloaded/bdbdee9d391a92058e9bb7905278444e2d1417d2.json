But Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party is now shifting towards a more pro-EU position.\n\nSo Swinson has gone even harder, telling the party faithful in Bournemouth that the Lib Dems would revoke Article 50 without a referendum if she was in Downing Street.\n\nThe move has caused fury among Brexiteers, who deem it undemocratic, as well as ripples of concern among advocates for a Final Say referendum.\n\nBut Swinson is gambling this will play well for her Europhile base. The Opinium poll found 55 per cent of Remain voters supported cancelling Brexit, and only 26 per cent support extending the Brexit negotiations and putting a revised deal to a public vote.\n\nThe pledge is designed to offer a distinctive message from Labour, in advance of its annual conference in Brighton this weekend.\n\nLabour has already shifted towards supporting a referendum on any deal \u2013 and pro-EU activists will be piling the pressure on Corbyn to commit to campaigning for Remain.\n\nThe problem for the Lib Dems will be transforming the energy and optimism into Westminster seats.\n\nVeteran pollster Sir John Curtice said there were only 22 constituencies where the Lib Dems came within 25 points of the winning candidate in 2017, which he himself describes as a \u201cgenerous definition\u201d of a marginal seat.\n\nOf these seats, plenty were in Leave areas and would involve taking on the Tories, who are starting to hoover up the Brexit Party vote.\n\nThe Lib Dems and Labour could end up scrabbling over the same voters in pro-EU areas \u2013 leaving the way clear for the Conservatives.\n\nAn upcoming election will undoubtedly be a Brexit election, but the Lib Dems will want to think carefully about what else they stand for, if they want to win big.", "description": "It seems\u00a0the sky is the limit for the Liberal Democrats at the moment, as unbridled optimism sweeps over\u00a0the party\u2019s annual gathering.
