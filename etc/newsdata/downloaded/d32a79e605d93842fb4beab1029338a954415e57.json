He had been on his cellphone, speaking to his mother at 11 p.m., in a quiet corner of the area.\n\n\u201cPortland police will be here in a minute,\u201d a guard said to Massey, a black guest.\n\n\u201cWhy are they coming?\u201d Massey asked. He explained he was staying at the hotel.\n\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d the guard responded.\n\nClaiming that Massey was \u201cloitering\u201d and that his presence was a threat to other guests\u2019 safety, the guard had the police escort Massey to his room and gather his belongings, and then lead him off the property.\n\nOn Tuesday, Massey filed a lawsuit against the Oregon hotel, the security guard and the guard\u2019s on-duty manager, alleging that he was falsely arrested and racially discriminated against last year by the two men, both of whom have since been fired. The lawsuit seeks $3 million for pain and suffering and gives notice that he intends to sue for an additional $7 million in punitive damages.\n\n[Oregon hotel fires employees seen on video evicting black guest]\n\n\u201cWe hope to find out what have they done to change anything in the last 10 months,\u201d said Portland attorney Jason Kafoury, who is representing Massey, according to NBC News. \u201cAnd we\u2019re also going to use this case to set an example so that other hotels and the Hilton don\u2019t treat anybody else like this.\u201d\n\nSince the incident, the president of the Portland chapter of the NAACP attempted to work on discrimination issues with DoubleTree and with Hilton, Kafoury wrote in a statement Wednesday. DoubleTree adopted some of the organization\u2019s suggestions, but Hilton Hotels \u201ccompletely rebuffed\u201d its attempts to discuss national policy with the the company.\n\n\u201cMr. Massey hopes to learn what policies of Hilton have led to these events, what Hilton has done in response to such events, and will ask the jury to punish Hilton as an example to other hotels who may be tempted to encourage or tolerate discrimination at their places of business,\u201d Kafoury wrote.\n\nMassey, who has worked for the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division and the FBI, shared a video of the Dec. 22 incident on Instagram at the time. The post garnered national attention.\n\n\u201cHe said that I was a safety threat to the other guests and that I was trespassing and that I was a disturbance because I took a personal phone call from my mom in a more remote area of the lobby,\u201d Massey wrote on the social platform.\n\nMassey is seen showing the manager and security guard a ticket containing his room number that he received after checking in. He had been dealing with a family emergency, Massey says in the video.\n\n\u201cI will be seeking justice,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBelieve that.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nOn eve of trade talks, Trump declines to criticize China for pressuring NBA in dispute over Hong Kong protests\n\nGitHub\u2019s employees want ICE contract canceled: \u2018We cannot offset human lives with money\u2019\n\nRubio seeks U.S. government probe of TikTok over Chinese censorship concerns", "description": "The lawsuit seeks $3 million for pain and suffering and gives notice that he intends to sue for an additional $7 million in punitive damages.", "authors": ["Deanna Paul", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter", "October At Am", "Deanna Paul Covers National", "Breaking News For The Washington Post.
