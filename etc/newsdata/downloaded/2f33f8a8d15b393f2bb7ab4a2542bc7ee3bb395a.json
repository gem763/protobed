Rather than relying on malware or exploiting software vulnerabilities, the attackers worked relentlessly to gather information that could be used to activate password resets and other account recovery services Microsoft provides.\n\n\u201cHighly motivated\u201d\n\nThe attacks on the campaign were part of a major offensive by Phosphorous that\u2014over a 30-day period from August to September\u2014made more than 2,700 attempts to identify consumer email accounts belonging to targeted individuals. Besides campaign staff, targeted accounts also belonged to current and former US government officials, journalists covering global politics, and prominent Iranians living outside of Iran. Of the more than 2,700 attempts to identify accounts, 241 of them were attacked. The attacks resulted in the successful compromise of four accounts, none of which belonged to the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhile the attacks we\u2019re disclosing today were not technically sophisticated, they attempted to use a significant amount of personal information both to identify the accounts belonging to their intended targets and in a few cases to attempt attacks,\u201d Tom Burt, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president of customer security and trust, wrote in a post. \u201cThis effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering.\u201d\n\nAccording to Burt, here\u2019s how the account takeover attempts worked:\n\nPhosphorous used information gathered from researching their targets or other means to game password reset or account recovery features and attempt to take over some targeted accounts. For example, they would seek access to a secondary email account linked to a user\u2019s Microsoft account, then attempt to gain access to a user\u2019s Microsoft account through verification sent to the secondary account. In some instances, they gathered phone numbers belonging to their targets and used them to assist in authenticating password resets.\n\nGird your loins\n\nIn July, Microsoft said that in the previous 12 months, it notified almost 10,000 customers that they had been targeted or compromised by nation-sponsored hackers . Chief among the hacking groups were Holmium and Mercury, both of them codenames for distinct groups backed by Iran\u2019s government. Other attacks were sponsored by the governments of Russia and North Korea. About 84 percent of the attacks targeted large \u201centerprise\u201d organizations such as corporations, with the remaining 16 percent hitting consumers.\n\nBurt on Friday called on Microsoft customers to enable two-step verification (2SV) to protect their accounts. The most robust form of 2SV requires users to have a physical security key such as a Yubikey from Yubico. Before an account can be accessed from a new computer or phone, the user must plug the key into a USB slot, or connect to the device over NFC or Bluetooth Low Energy. A useful, though less effective form of 2SV requires short-lived one-time passwords that are fed from an authenticator app installed on a user\u2019s phone.\n\nBurt also reminded users to periodically check the login history of their accounts. If there are logins from unrecognized devices of IP addresses, you can notify Microsoft by clicking a \u201cSecure Your Account\u201d link. Both the 2SV and login history features can be accessed in the Account Security settings.\n\nAccounts that are part of a political campaign, political party committee, or non-governmental organization or think tank related to democracy are eligible for AccountGuard. The feature provides monitoring and a unified threat notification service across all the Office 365 accounts for both work and personal use. More than 60,000 accounts in 26 countries are currently enrolled. To date, Microsoft has issued more than 800 notifications of attempted nation-state attacks to AccountGuard members, up from 781 in July.", "description": "Over a recent 30-day stretch, Iran-sponsored hackers attacked 241 accounts in all.", "authors": ["Dan Goodin"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/WhiteHousenightphoto-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
