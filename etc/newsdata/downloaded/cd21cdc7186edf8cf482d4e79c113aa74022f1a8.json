His fifth. That\u2019s five babies dead. And I think I might return the favour. And I might kill you.\u2019\n\n\u2018I might end you. I\u2019mma light you on fire, bro,\u2019 he added.\n\nLogan later stood by his diss but claimed he was pro-choice.\n\nWhile these later controversies aren\u2019t mentioned in this latest trailer, we\u2019ll have to wait and see if The Maverick really *is* just a \u2018puff piece\u2019 to make people feel sorry for Logan.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
