Upton supports an inquiry into Trump, but not one with impeachment in front of its name", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cSo you\u2019re supportive of the idea that there needs to be this inquiry. You\u2019re not questioning that,\u201d Stephen Henderson, \u201cDetroit Today\u201d host, clarified.\n\n\u201cYeah, I want the answers to the questions that need to be raised,\u201d Upton said.\n\nBut when pressed later on whether that meant he was supportive of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry of Trump, Upton\u2019s spokesman said, \u201che does not\u201d and pointed to other comments made by the congressman that parse his desire for information about what Trump did with a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of questions to ask. I don\u2019t know where the answers are going to take us, and there seems to be more questions that can be asked and more developing details,\u201d Upton said at an event Wednesday at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\n\u201cBut to be clear, you are for investigations in a hearing to determine the facts?\u201d a moderator asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not for the formal, you know, the impeachment inquiry that came up last week, but it is the right of any committee \u2026 I think there are legitimate questions that have to be asked and people are going to be required to answer them. You need to know what the answers are,\u201d Upton responded.\n\nUpton, who has served in Congress for more than three decades, including during President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, said last week in a statement that the developments regarding Trump seeking assistance from Ukraine to obtain dirt on former vice president Joe Biden were \u201cdisconcerting,\u201d but that he wanted to \u201creview the facts that emerge before making any conclusions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUpton, one of the last remaining so-called moderates in the House Republican caucus, has taken a stand against Trump\u2019s behavior in the past. When the House voted in July to \u201cstrongly condemn\u201d Trump\u2019s tweets suggesting four freshman Democratic women of color \u201cgo home,\u201d Upton was one of four Republicans to vote for it.\n\nBut Upton doesn\u2019t appear to want to be the first House Republican to offer full-throated backing of an impeachment proceeding. Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada found himself in a similar predicament last week when comments he made in support of an \u201coversight process\u201d to determine whether Trump broke the law were widely interpreted as support for an impeachment inquiry. Amodei forcefully denied that that was what he meant.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version referred to NPR\u2019s Michigan station. It\u2019s an NPR member station in Detroit.\n\nAD", "description": "The Michigan congressman clarified that his desire for answers about Trump does not mean he backs an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/k75xRzratwQufABt9NmmNn1Kq6U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P4XXWDHFMII6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
