But after a long wait, the beauty mega store is finally back, this time in IFC.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of Sephora, it\u2019s basically a one-stop shop for all things beauty and skincare. But there\u2019s a LOT. To help you navigate the huge selection, here are the best five brands for teens to look out for.\n\nSephora\n\nIf you have absolutely no idea where to start, check out the shop\u2019s own brand of skincare, make-up, and beauty tools. There\u2019s actually a wide selection of genuinely fantastic products. The makeup formulas may not pack that wow factor of higher-end goodies, but they\u2019re dependable and give you a beautiful look every time.\n\nThe make-up brushes are a great place to start if you\u2019re just starting to use them, and are very durable. And if you\u2019re not really into makeup or beauty but still want to take care of your skin, the brand also makes face wipes and masks packed with ingredients for different skin types. Seriously, you can\u2019t go wrong.\n\nEssential guide to make-up brushes\n\nZoeva\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for eyeshadow palettes that are very useable but not too pricy, Zoeva is a great option. The brand does a fabulous job of grouping together shades and finishes that complement each other, and are easy to use.\n\nAnother good thing about the brand is that all the products, whether eyeshadow, blush or highlighter, have creamy, easy-to-blend formulas that last all day. The brush sets are also a great investment.\n\nFirst Aid Beauty\n\nThis is a little bit of a splurge but you\u2019re paying for what you get: there\u2019s a lot of product in each container, and they last a good while because a little goes a long way.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing fussy or complicated about this brand; it just offers very comforting, effective skincare products. If you\u2019ve never found a moisturiser you feel works very well for your skin, try the Ultra Repair line; if your skin is somewhat problematic, the Oatmeal line may help.\n\nPro makeup tips for darker skin tones\n\nNudestix\n\nIf you\u2019re after a no-make-up make-up look, Nudestix is for you. True to its name, this brand specialises in easy-peasy products that are perfect for the minimalist who just wants to look natural and pretty.\n\nYou may not find your va-va-voom red lipstick here, but you\u2019ll find that blush that makes you look naturally flushed. The products are almost exclusively cream formulas, which is part of why they look so natural, and are so easy to work with.\n\nBasic skincare guide for guys and beginners: protect your skin, fight acne, and feel good\n\nToo Faced\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to treat yourself to make-up that looks beautiful on the skin and gorgeous on your vanity, you can\u2019t go wrong with Too Faced. The packaging is absolutely adorable, and the products are top notch.\n\nGranted, this brand is a treat; it\u2019s not as affordable as some of the others we\u2019ve mentioned. But it also boasts cult products such as the Chocolate Bar eyeshadow palette, so it\u2019s not surprising it costs a little more.\n\nToo Faced has fun with its products and offers lots of brilliant shades and finishes in its eyeshadows and lipsticks. And the Peach Perfect Comfort Matte Foundation is one of those rare foundations that survives Hong Kong heat and humidity.
