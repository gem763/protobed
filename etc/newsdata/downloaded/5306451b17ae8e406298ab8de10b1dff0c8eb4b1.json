It\u2019s called Cleanyst, and press coverage of the device so far has breathlessly repeated the company\u2019s line that it\u2019s the \u201cSodaStream for cleaning products.\u201d On their Kickstarter page, Cleanyst says its device \u201cdelivers the convenience of a Keurig or Nespresso appliance\u201d and \u201cthe environmental benefits of a SodaStream.\u201d Wow.\n\nYes \u2014 at first glance, it may indeed dispense Keurig-like things into a SodaStream-shaped bottle \u2014 but it\u2019s also very obviously a Juicero.\n\nHere\u2019s a side-by-side image comparison:\n\nJuicero was a doomed company that shut down in 2017 after people realized you could just squeeze the juice bag without needing the assistance of a $700 Wi-Fi-connected machine. Cleanyst is at least a less costly bet on bag-squeezing technology, and customers can buy into its ecosystem starting at $99. (Of course, if you just want to support the research & development of bag-squeezing technology, there\u2019s also a $5 tier with no tangible rewards.) Cleanyst plans to sell the device at a higher retail price after the Kickstarter, according to Fast Company. When we asked if they knew about Juicero while designing their bag-squeezing device, a Cleanyst spokesperson told us that it \u201cis not related to any preexisting products.\u201d\n\nCleanyst certainly looks more useful than a single-purpose juice squeezer, but it\u2019s too early to tell if the device is similarly necessary. Can you just squeeze the company\u2019s proprietary bags of cleaning products into a bottle yourself? Do you need the mixer thingy, or could you just add water and shake for a minute? The company says no; Cleanyst insists that \u201cthe machine\u2019s main purpose is to professionally mix the product to the correct viscosity at home, which cannot be properly done by hand.\u201d Indeed, the device is more sophisticated than the Juicero, which merely squeezed bags to maximize their nutrition, whereas Cleanyst squeezes bags, dispenses hot water, and then uses an impeller to mix the solution in a bottle.\n\nThe designers say Cleanyst is meant to reduce the environmental impact of shipping a bunch of cleaning products to people\u2019s homes that are mostly made of water. And the device uses \u201c100% recyclable\u201d pouches that are meant to be mailed back to the company for reuse. But, according to Fast Company, Cleanyst has not yet completed a life cycle analysis to determine the environmental impact of its own system \u2014 so it\u2019s not clear yet if the big plastic appliance you\u2019d be buying actually offsets using plastic bottles.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s Cleanyst: it\u2019s not a Juicero, but it kind of is.", "description": "Cleanyst is a new device on Kickstarter that helps people make cleaning products at home, and it looks a lot like a $700 juicer.", "authors": ["T.C.
