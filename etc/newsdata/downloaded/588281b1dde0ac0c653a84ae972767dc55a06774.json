Early monuments can be traced as far back as the 11th dynasty, which occurred between 2081 and 1939 B.C.\n\nAD\n\nAuthorities said more details about the coffins would be divulged in a news conference Saturday.\n\nEgypt is on a roll with its digging into the past.\n\nLast week, the Antiquities Ministry announced that archaeologists had found 30 workshops for the manufacturing and processing of funeral furniture for the tombs of kings in the Valley of the Kings, which served as the primary burial site for pharaohs from the 18th to the 20th dynasty. Researchers found a kiln for producing pottery and metal, where items such as silver rings and gold foil were also uncovered. The workshops, dated from 1539 B.C. to 1292 B.C., CNN reported.\n\nAD\n\nThe discovery of the workshops opened up a new way to understand the tools and techniques used for making royal coffins and tomb furniture, an archaeologist told CNN.
