At this point, it\u2019s hard to know how soon it will be needed.\n\nAs Republican presidential contender Bill Weld said Monday night, it\u2019s basically impossible not to conclude that the allegations against Trump are impeachable offenses, assuming they are backed up by a whistleblower complaint and findings by the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general that the administration is doing its best to suppress.\n\nAlso read: Why Trump impeachment threat is now rattling stock-market investors\n\nBut in case you\u2019re especially hard to convince, let\u2019s review what we think we know.\n\nTrump ordered aides to impound about $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, which has for five years been fighting to protect itself and its democracy from Russian proxy-military incursion. He then pressed Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to reopen an investigation of a Ukrainian natural-gas company that had been closed, without charges, hoping to find dirt \u2014 not on the strongman but on Hunter Biden, an outside director of the company whose father, Joe, is running to replace Trump next year.\n\nCollusion with campaign\n\nAnd he wanted Zelensky to coordinate that probe \u2014 not with the State Department but with Trump\u2019s personal attorney and fixer, Rudy Giuliani. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump asked eight times about the probe \u2014 again, Trump envisioned a fraudulent one, since Ukrainian officials had already closed the case.\n\nNow he\u2019s selling a Santa Claus story that he was fighting Ukraine\u2019s corruption \u2014 as he fought corruption in Russia, where he\u2019s best buds with Vladimir Putin\u2019s kleptocracy. And in Puerto Rico, where a three-person company from the hometown of Trump\u2019s then\u2013interior secretary won a no-bid contract, later rescinded, to rebuild Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical grid after a hurricane.\n\nAnd in his own cabinet, which has included Wilbur Ross at the Commerce Department, Tom Price at Health and Human Services, Alex Acosta as labor secretary, Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency, Ryan Zinke at the Interior Department and so on. And on his lawn, where Republican Chris Collins managed to get photographed in the very act of criminal insider trading, according to an indictment.\n\nTriple play\n\nLet\u2019s be real. If Trump tied military aid to Ukrainian interference in our election, that\u2019s extortion, or solicitation of a bribe. If he asked Ukraine to help his campaign out of the goodness of its heart, as he has seemed to confirm, that\u2019s a crime called conspiracy against the United States \u2014 not the criminal-law definition of treason but within dictionary definitions. (It\u2019s also a campaign-finance violation.)\n\nAnd the assertion of false privileges to keep the whistleblower\u2019s complaint from Congress covers \u201cother high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nTriple play \u2014 no president has ever done that before.\n\nThe transition\n\nNow, about the transition.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, I called Chris Lu, who ran Barack Obama\u2019s transition in 2008-2009, to ask whether Democrats should set up a unified transition effort this year in anticipation of next year\u2019s election.\n\nThe idea was twofold: to send a message that mostly unified Democrats agreed on the need to undo Trump\u2019s policies and to get moving quickly on reversing them.\n\nIt\u2019s especially necessary in areas such as trade and climate, where Trump\u2019s policies have done tangible damage. (Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated last year that Trump\u2019s trade tweets alone took 6% off the S&P 500 SPX, -0.84%. ) The idea is to be ready to do, on Day 1, all the things Democrats are promising to do right away.\n\nLu was skeptical. He thought there was time to get going next year on the early executive orders needed to undo Trump\u2019s border policies, tariffs and to withdraw the government\u2019s court defenses of a whole list of Trump\u2019s disputed environmental-policy changes.\n\nAfter all, Lu said, it\u2019s simple to file a notice with a judge that a Democratic president won\u2019t try to kill Obama-era methane-emission rules anymore, or will withdraw rules the EPA proposes to replace them, for example.\n\nPence exposed as well\n\nBut now it\u2019s looking likelier that Trump may fall.\n\nAnd since Vice President Mike Pence apparently got himself involved in the scheme, meeting with Zelensky when Trump skipped a summit to monitor the path of the most recent hurricane from his golf course, he\u2019s got significant legal exposure, too.\n\nSo it may be time to get cracking on transition, after all.\n\nYou never know when the dam will break. It\u2019s cracking now.\n\nIf Pence falls, it would set up the ultimate misbegotten Trump troll \u2014 in the end, the joke\u2019s always on him. Unable to nominate a vice president who can be confirmed by a Democratic House, he\u2019d face a Senate judging him in the harsh light of senators\u2019 own re-election prospects.\n\nAnd waiting at the end \u2014 of the trial and of a decade of Trump\u2019s snidely sexist tweets about her \u2014 would be President Nancy Pelosi.\n\nLowers voice, speaks rapidly ...
