It will feature a new processor design, compact electronics that lower error rates and \u201cstate-of-the-art quantum computational research with 95 percent availability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s quantum program also now supports 80 partnerships with commercial clients, academic institutions and research laboratories. The global community of users has run more than 14 million experiments on IBM's quantum computers since 2016 and published more than 200 scientific papers, according to the release.\n\nWith the advances in quantum computing, more doors could be opened to new discoveries in medicine, optimization of supply chains and better ways to model financial data.\n\nIBM's stock was up 0.1 percent as of press time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "\u201cOur strategy was to move quantum computing beyond isolated lab experiments into the hands of tens of thousands of users,\u201d Dario Gil, director of IBM Research, said.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
