I feel I\u2019m mature enough to be able to deal with it. There\u2019s more than just a slogger in there.\n\nColin Munro put on 107 to help a New Zealand Cricket Board XI beat England by eight wickets\n\n\u2018I back my ability one hundred per cent,\u2019 said Gregory. \u2018If I get a crack, I\u2019ll go out and perform'\n\n\u2018This series is a great opportunity for any of the guys to put their hands up and go: \u201cLook at me, look at what I can do\u201d. They\u2019ll be pushing to stake a claim for that T20 World Cup.\u2019\n\nGregory admitted his seam bowling had \u2018cobwebs\u2019 as he conceded 27 in two overs and he apologised to fellow debutant Matt Parkinson after dropping an outfield catch off his bowling during an impressive performance from Lancashire\u2019s leg-spinner.\n\nSelection for England\u2019s Test squad against Ireland earlier in the summer was an early indication that Gregory \u2014 at 27, the oldest of the tourists\u2019 batch of new faces \u2014 is regarded by the selectors as a multi-format cricketer.\n\nLewis Gregory and Joe Denly of England walk from the ground at the end of the first innings\n\nBut while Munro was blazing nine fours and seven sixes around Lincoln\u2019s picturesque but chilly Bert Sutcliffe Oval, adding 138 in 11 overs with Anaru Kitchen, England\u2019s bowling looked especially vulnerable.\n\nTom Curran began tidily but Pat Brown took his figures across the two practice games to 7-0-80-1 and Saqib Mahmood was unable to stem the flow. At least Parkinson looked the part, raising hopes he could yet form an intriguing two-pronged leg-spin attack with Adil Rashid.\n\nAfter removing Anton Devcich with his third ball in England colours, Parkinson was somehow denied an lbw decision when Munro had 26, then had Kitchen dropped on 17 by the contrite Gregory. Defeat came with nine balls to spare.\n\nGregory is vying with the Curran brothers, Sam and Tom (pictured), as well as Chris Jordan, for temporary tag of England\u2019s leading all-rounder during this tour\n\nEarlier, James Vince top-scored with 46, while Joe Denly accelerated sweetly during an unbeaten 39. But England will be mildly concerned than Somerset opener Tom Banton followed the 11 he made on Sunday with just six here, before miscuing a lofted drive.\n\nMore concerned, that is, than his county team-mate. \u2018I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s too much going on up top with Bants so I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s going to be too worried,\u2019 said Gregory.\n\n\u2018He had an absolutely fantastic Vitality Blast. I watched him in the nets the other day, and he was striking it pretty well, so if that opportunity comes, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll take it.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Surrey have re-signed Hashim Amla on a Kolpak deal following his retirement from international cricket in August.", "description": "Gregory smashed an unbeaten 29 from 11 balls on his senior debut as the tourists racked up 188 for five.
