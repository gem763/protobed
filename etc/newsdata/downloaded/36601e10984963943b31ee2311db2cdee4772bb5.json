We are now taking steps to determine if they have spread from this water body and, hopefully, keep it from spreading to other Georgia waters,\u201d he concluded.\n\nReports said the invasive fish have previously been found in 14 other states and are native to the Yangtze River basin in China, according to WYFF 4.\n\n\u201cInvasive species are often introduced through unauthorized release. Non-native invasive species, such as the northern snakehead, have the potential to affect native species in introduced areas by competing for food and habitat,\u201d the report stated. \u201cIn Georgia, it is unlawful to import, transport, sell, transfer or possess any species of snakehead fish without a valid wild animal license.\u201d\n\nThe northern snakehead fish can reportedly grow up to three feet long and is described as long and thin, with a long dorsal fin and dark brown coloring.\n\nOfficials said it is important to be able to identify the invasive fish and advised anyone who believes they have caught one to kill and freeze it immediately, take photos of its mouth, fins, and tail, and note the location where it was caught.\n\nOfficials have also asked that a report of the catch be made to a regional Georgia DNR Wildlife Resources Division Fisheries Office to help combat the problem.", "description": "An invasive fish was caught in Gwinnett County, Georgia, the state's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) confirmed Tuesday.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-144629033-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
