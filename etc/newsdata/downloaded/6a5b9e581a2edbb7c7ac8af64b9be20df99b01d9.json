I immediately tap the Updates tab, refresh the list just to make sure every update is there, tap the \u201cUpdate All\u201d button, and enjoy a rush of endorphins as my phone downloads all of those sweet, sweet bug fixes and performance improvements.\n\nOn iOS 13, however, Apple has replaced my beloved Updates tab with Apple Arcade, so when I first started using the new OS, I was lost. How would I get my updates? After more panic than I care to admit, I eventually figured it out. The process is just as easy as it was before. It\u2019s just a little more hidden.\n\nRelated iOS 13 is now available to download\n\nHere\u2019s how to update your apps:\n\nOpen the App Store.\n\nTap on your Apple ID profile picture in the top right corner.\n\nIf you have updates already pending, they\u2019ll be at the bottom of your screen. If you want to refresh the list, just pull down.\n\nIf you have updates ready, tap \u201cUpdate All\u201d at the top of the updates list and watch those update circles fill.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a way to get to your pending app updates that\u2019s harder to find, but arguably faster:\n\nLong-press on the App Store icon\n\nTap on Updates\n\nThat\u2019s it! Now you, like me, can make sure every app is always updated, no matter what.\n\nUpdate September 24th, 2:45PM ET: Added another method to access pending updates that a reader shared with me.
