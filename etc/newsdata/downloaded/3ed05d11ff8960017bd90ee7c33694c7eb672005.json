It\u2019s painful but he will be fine.\n\n\"And Mo is his ankle, it gets sore the longer the game goes but it is not a massive issue.\"\n\nHarry Kane had given Tottenham a perfect start on away soil, scoring after just 47 seconds.\n\nLiverpool captain Jordan Henderson pulled the Reds back level in the second half with a well taken finish, before Salah converted from the spot.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSpeaking after the match, Henderson told Sky Sports: \"After 48 seconds I was thinking it was my fault because I gave the ball away for their goal.\n\n\"Thankfully I managed to get a goal to make up for it.\n\n\"I'm just delighted for the three points. We were hanging on a little bit. In the first half I thought we played really The keeper made some great saves.\n\n\"Our mentality has improved. That's grown over the last few years and the gaffer has changed that so much.\n\n\"We have faced adversity at times. It's not always going to go your own way.\"\n\n(Image: Offside via Getty Images)\n\nLiverpool restored their six-point lead at the top of the table with the win, and Mane highlighted the importance of the result.\n\n\"Every win is a big moment,\" Mane said. \"Of course we want to win the title but it's too early to speak about it.\n\n\"They scored first but I was thinking in my own mind we were going to come back.
