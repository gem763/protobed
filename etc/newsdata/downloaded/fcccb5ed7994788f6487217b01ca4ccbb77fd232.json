REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde/File Photo\n\nNigerian soldiers had left the town earlier that month under a new strategy of withdrawing to \u201csuper camps\u201d that can be more easily defended against insurgents the army has been struggling to contain for a decade.\n\nUnchallenged, the Islamist militants torched a clinic in Magumeri, ransacked government buildings and looted shops before returning to another town they had raided that night called Gubio, residents said.\n\nThe new military strategy announced by President Muhammadu Buhari in July to concentrate soldiers in big bases is designed to give troops a secure platform from which they can respond quickly to threats in the region and raid militant camps.\n\nPeople familiar with the military\u2019s thinking and security officials, however, say the new tactic for fighting Islamic State\u2019s West Africa branch and Boko Haram is mainly an attempt to stem casualties.\n\nThe military did not respond to requests for more details about its strategy or the impact it will have on the region.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe the days of BH (Boko Haram) moving freely and passing in between static defensive locations are over,\u201d Major General Olusegun Adeniyi, who commands the anti-insurgency operation, told reporters last month.\n\nBoko Haram launched an insurgency in 2009 to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic caliphate. The group, whose unofficial name means \u201cWestern education is forbidden\u201d, held territory the size of Belgium in 2014 but a multinational offensive recaptured much of it the following year.\n\nThe group split in 2016 and the faction that has been the greater threat ever since won the recognition of Islamic State.\n\nThe decade of war has killed more than 30,000 civilians and spawned what the United Nations calls one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises, which foreign nations are trying to contain with billions of dollars of aid.\n\nBut the crisis shows no sign of abating.\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S A MESS\u2019\n\nThe army\u2019s withdrawal into large bases has coincided with a string of insurgent raids on newly unprotected towns and has left the militants free to set up checkpoints on roads as they roam more freely across the countryside, according to three briefing notes from an international aid and development organisation, two security officials and residents.\n\nThat has left thousands of civilians without access to aid, according to the briefing notes seen by Reuters.\n\nSoldiers are no longer protecting some key roads, cutting off access for humanitarians workers as more of the region falls under the sway of the insurgents, aid and security sources said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mess, militarily, and a disaster for humanitarian actors,\u201d one foreign security official said.\n\nThe population of towns being abandoned by the military is a combined 223,000 people, according to one of the aid agency briefing notes.\n\nThe military departures so far have cut off more than 100,000 people from aid and if more soldiers go, as many as 121,000 other civilians could flee their towns, one aid agency briefing note said.\n\n\u201cThe impact will be one of continued skirmishes - soldiers under constant strain to deal with the insurgency where Islamic State and Boko Haram dictate the momentum,\u201d said Jasmine Opperman, a terrorism expert based in South Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how many \u201csuper camps\u201d the army plans to set up, where they will be nor how many soldiers each will hold.\n\n\u2018HERE TO PROTECT YOU\u2019\n\nThe new strategy follows a series of setbacks for the army which has failed to keep a tight grip on territory it has clawed back since 2015. Last year, insurgents repeatedly overran smaller bases and sent soldiers and tens of thousands of people fleeing from larger towns.\n\nSecurity experts put the military death toll since June 2018 at anywhere from hundreds of soldiers to in excess of 1,000.\n\nThe military has not released casualty figures but denies that many soldiers have been killed.\n\nOne security adviser at an international aid organisation said a major goal of the new large bases was damage control, rather than going on the offensive.\n\n\u201cIt is to consolidate all of the strength in one place to prevent them being overrun every week,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nHe said the areas vacated were being filled by insurgents and that would make it harder for the military to re-enter, leaving civilians vulnerable.\n\nThose concerns were echoed by the governor of Borno - the birthplace of Boko Haram and the state worst hit by the insurgency. Governor Babagana Umara Zulum told reporters last month that recent attacks were the result of a \u201cserious vacuum\u201d following the withdrawal of soldiers.\n\nIslamic State is also using its newfound freedom to woo locals. Drained by the decade-long conflict, some are open to moving into areas controlled by the insurgents where life can be more stable, residents said.\n\nBefore hitting Magumeri last month, the militants had passed through the town of Gubio, some 40 km (25 miles) to the north.\n\nThere, an Islamic State fighter led evening prayers followed by a sermon, according to six residents.\n\n\u201cWe are here to protect you, not to harm any one of you,\u201d the IS fighter told residents. \u201cThose with uniforms are your enemies, and we are here to deal with them and their supporters. You should feel free.\u201d\n\nRather than flee to a government-controlled city such as Borno state\u2019s capital Maiduguri, many Gubio residents stayed.", "description": "When Islamic State gunmen stormed the northeast Nigerian town of Magumeri on the night of August 21, they had free rein.", "authors": ["Paul Carsten", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430376353&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0HN-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
