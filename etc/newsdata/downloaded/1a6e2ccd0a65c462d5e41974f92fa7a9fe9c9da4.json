They pointed to the fact the forecast hinged on sales revenue increasing, even though sales had been going backwards for years, dropping to $3.1 billion by 2014 from $3.3 billion in 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMyer agreed it had told the market it expected a net profit of $98.5 million but denied it had misled or deceived shareholders or witheld material information from the market.\n\nThe decision sets a precedent for listed companies which provide profit guidance and their boards, shareholders, insurers, litigation funders and lawyers who run these cases.\n\nTwo Myer investors, Christopher and Jacinta Amies, who were trustees of the Amies Superannuation Fund, spearheaded the court case as lead plaintiffs in the class action through trustee company TPT Patrol.\n\nBarristers Norman O'Bryan, SC, and Michael Symons with firm Portfolio Law fought the case on behalf of Myer shareholders, while barristers Ian Waller, QC, and Paul Liondas with law firm Clayton Utz defended Myer.\n\nThe plaintiffs' case was funded Australian Funding Partners, which is run by ex-MinterEllison partner Mark Elliott. Mr Elliott had originally attempted to sue Myer as the lead plaintiff, litigation funder and lawyer on the case before his case was thrown out as an abuse of process.\n\nMore to come", "description": "Myer misled shareholders over its forecast 2015 profits and breached its disclosure obligations but shareholders suffered no loss because \"hard-edged\" analysts didn't believe the forecast, a court has found.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_3%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6542e8e651ab31f9676d424044836c6f5a82c891", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
