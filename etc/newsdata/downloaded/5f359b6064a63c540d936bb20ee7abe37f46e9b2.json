The cryptocurrency is now trading at around $7,800, falling well below the $8,000 level. This marks a decrease of around 4% on the day as Bitcoin\u2019s total market cap now sits at around $141 billion.\n\nBitcoin Price Goes Down Again\n\nAfter a weekend of sideways action, Bitcoin begins the new week losing another chunk of its value. The cryptocurrency just lost about $350 of its price in a sudden move south.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at around $7,800, losing another 4% in the past 24 hours alone.\n\nAs seen on the chart, the move was again instant. Bitcoin\u2019s total market capitalization is now $141 billion and it represents 67.5% of the total market.\n\nWhile it\u2019s challenging to note the exact reasons for the price fall, it\u2019s clear that bears continue to put pressure. Last week was colored in red despite the launch of Bakkt, which was one of the most anticipated events in 2019. The platform failed to attract serious interest as the volume traded on it is easily negligible so far.\n\nThe Market Feels It As Well\n\nDrops in Bitcoin\u2019s price used to provide altcoins with the opportunity to catch up and reclaim some market share. This time that\u2019s not the case and it appears as the entire market is painted in red. It\u2019s worth noting that this is somewhat the trend during the past few months of 2019 as altcoins fail to capitalize on any shortcomings in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAs seen on the chart below, the overwhelming majority of cryptocurrencies are bleeding out when trading against the USD.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case when trading against Bitcoin, however. Almost all of the altcoins are marking slight gains against BTC, with Ripple (XRP) leading the way with almost 4%. ETH is also up about 1.5%, as well as Stellar which is up 2.56%.\n\nIt seems that the latest price fall has its silver lining after all, mainly for those who are holding altcoins and are hoping for their recovery.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "It appears that last week\u2019s selling pressure can\u2019t seem to stop as Bitcoin lost yet another $350 of its value in another vicious spike downwards.
