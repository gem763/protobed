I like that hair. I got to work on mine.\u201d\n\nThe gesture was \u201csweet and emotional,\u201d Kingston said, and she appreciated it -- especially because her mother tripped and hit her head while trying to retrieve the trash can in January.\n\nKingston said she had seen Shelby before on the camera helping her mother with the garbage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed him a few times on the camera returning the trash can, but not to this personal extent,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like his own grandmother that he\u2019s helping, like one of his family members.\u201d\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA DEPUTY SAVES CHOKING 12-DAY-OLD INFANT AFTER STOPPING SPEEDING VEHICLE\n\nKingston said her mother looked forward to seeing Shelby every week and even would say a prayer for him when he came by.\n\n\u201cJust thanking God that he\u2019s there doing his part to help her,\u201d Kingston said.\n\nShe was able to identify the kind sanitation worker through the help of Facebook, Kingston pointed out.\n\n\u201cMy niece posted it in several groups saying, \u2018Does anybody know who this is?\u2019 And then, one of her friends who works for Waste Management said she would help us, and then one of his close friends actually reached out to me,\u201d Kingston explained.\n\nShelby came to Zucca's house on Wednesday night, and Kingston got the opportunity to thank him in person.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKingston said Shelby and her family will attend a Kansas City Chiefs football game together next month. She\u2019s coordinating with the team, which donated the tickets, to ensure he has a memorable experience.\n\n\u201cKnowing that somebody else would care for a stranger like they would their own family member, it reminds me that there are lots of good people still around,\u201d Kingston said, adding that she thought Shelby and her mother will have a lasting friendship.", "description": "A sanitation worker in Missouri was caught on camera going out of his way to help an 88-year-old\u00a0woman with dementia on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
