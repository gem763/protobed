Republicans say they\u2019re still awaiting more documents from the Obama administration.\n\nDemocrats had in recent weeks suggested they may walk away from the committee, that they allege is a partisan witch hunt, after Clinton\u2019s appearance. But after a meeting with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Friday in the Capitol, Democrats announced that they would continue participating for now.\n\nThe committee is deeply divided, and Democrats say they have concluded that they can counter Republicans more effectively by remaining on the panel.\n\n\u201cWe have decided to stay on the committee, because somebody has to be in the room to defend the truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth,\u201d Elijah Cummings, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said Sunday on Meet The Press.\n\nHe cited Clinton\u2019s appearance as evidence.\n\n\u201cIf you listened to the questions that were being asked by Republicans and the way they tried to attack her, you really did need to have Democrats in the room to give the other side of the story, not so much ... to defend her, but to try to make sure that the complete picture was painted,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
