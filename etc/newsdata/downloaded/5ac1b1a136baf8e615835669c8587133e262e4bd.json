The only thing they all have in common is vinegar, garlic and pepper; the dish can also include soy sauce, sugar or coconut milk, plus different types of meat. I learned the basic technique from the cooks at the first restaurant in Hong Kong that I worked at as a pastry chef. The cooks took turns at making the staff meal, and since most of them were from the Philippines, adobo featured frequently.\n\nThis recipe employs an interesting technique - a reverse sear. Instead of browning the meat at the start, it is done towards the end, when already tender. While it is browning, reduce the sauce, then put the meat back into the pan and simmer the ingredients briefly. As with many stewed dishes, this one tastes better the next day.\n\nDon\u2019t be alarmed by the amount of vinegar \u2013 the acidity is balanced by sugar. The amount of sugar is variable, but don\u2019t use so much that the dish becomes sweet \u2013 the flavour should be a little sharp. If possible, use coconut, palm or rice vinegar, instead of inexpensive white vinegar, which is just acidic, without any subtlety. Don\u2019t be alarmed by the amount of garlic either. This is a boldly flavoured dish and should be served with plenty of white rice.", "description": "Adobo is one of those dishes for which there are almost as many recipes as there are cooks.
