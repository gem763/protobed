The son is said to have taken over some criminal operations from his father. The confrontation, which left eight dead, occurred in Culiacan, the capital of the western state of Sinaloa.\n\nHis public security minister, Alfonso Durazo, admitted that the operation to capture Guzman Lopez was a failure. Reporters peppered him with questions at a news conference in Culiacan, asking if he would resign. Durazo deflected, suggesting that he could do so if the moment arrives when he decides he no longer can contribute to securing peace in the nation.\n\n\u201cThe government clearly looks bad after this,\u201d Daniel Kerner, an analyst at Eurasia Group, wrote in a research report. \u201cIt clearly failed to plan and anticipate the response that going after the son of one of the most notable drug leaders in Mexico would generate given the cartel\u2019s influence in the city. As such, it looks like it had no strategy and no coordination.\u201d\n\nThe incident presents the biggest security challenge yet to Lopez Obrador, who was elected on promises to stop years of violence and has maintained an approval rate of more than 60% in polls despite a stagnant economy. Homicides are on pace to break last year\u2019s record, according to data through August, rising more than 3% to exceed 23,000.\n\nCartel members on Thursday turned Culiacan into a war zone after Mexican authorities surrounded Guzman Lopez at a house where he was taking refuge. Homemade tanks complete with machine guns rumbling through the streets, stopping traffic and firing repeatedly. The city was littered with burning vehicles as residents posted videos on Twitter of gunfire and chaos. Plumes of black smoke rose over buildings.\n\nHow AMLO\u2019s Plans to Transform Mexico Ran Into Reality: QuickTake\n\n\u201cThis decision was taken to protect citizens,\u201d Lopez Obrador said at his morning news conference Friday in the southern state of Oaxaca. \u201cYou can\u2019t put out fire with fire. That\u2019s the difference between our strategy and what previous governments have done. We don\u2019t want deaths, we don\u2019t want war.\u201d\n\n\u2018Pandora\u2019s Box\u2019\n\nResponding to the violence in Culiacan by letting Guzman Lopez go free sends a dangerous message to drug cartels that the Mexican government can be cowed by terrorist-like attacks against civilians, said Alejandro Schtulmann, who heads Mexico City-based political consultancy Empra. It\u2019s also embarrassing because the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s firepower has been diminished in recent years and pales in comparison to that of other ascendant groups like the Jalisco New Generation.\n\nNow, other groups when facing an arrest may \u201cresort to the same methods,\u201d he said. \u201cThis may have opened the Pandora\u2019s box in the context of fighting organized crime in Mexico.\u201d\n\nThe case rips open an old wound for Mexico, where El Chapo twice escaped from prison before he was recaptured and finally extradited and convicted in the U.S. It comes in a week when more than a dozen police were killed in an ambush in the deadliest attack on law enforcement since Lopez Obrador took office last December. At least 15 more people were killed in another shootout with the military in the nation\u2019s south.\n\nLopez Obrador said that the suspect had an arrest warrant and an extradition request. His father was sent to the U.S. in early 2017 just as President Donald Trump was taking office.\n\nThe son\u2019s release was immediately decried across Mexican media, with one of the nation\u2019s largest newspapers, Reforma, running a headline saying \u201cLittle Chapo Subdues the Fourth Transformation,\u201d referring to the nickname that Lopez Obrador has given to his government.\n\nAMLO Lays Out Broad Plan for Addressing Violence in Mexico\n\nMexico has fought a decades-long war against drug gangs, in part because it serves as a connector between cocaine-producing nations in South America and consumers in the U.S.\n\nAMLO\u2019s strategy focuses on deployment of tens of thousands of members from a new National Guard force to the most violent parts of the country, as well as education and subsidies for youth. But the phrase he has used to summarize his philosophy, \u201chugs, not shots,\u201d has been criticized by political rivals and many security analysts as naive and Pollyannish.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The decision by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s security cabinet to release the captured son of the world\u2019s most notorious drug lord left him struggling to contain the damage amid public outrage.AMLO, as the president is known, said the government took the decision after", "authors": ["Eric Martin", "Lorena Rios"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
