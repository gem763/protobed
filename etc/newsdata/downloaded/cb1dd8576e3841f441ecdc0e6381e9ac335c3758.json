Don\u2019t underestimate how big a step that was for the league, though when Commissioner Roger Goodell seeks something, he usually gets it.\n\nIssues with NFL officiating hardly are new. They get more focus and grow more controversial as TV technology develops. But never forget that the guys blowing whistles are seeing things in real time, in a sport played by men who become bigger, faster and stronger by the year. NFL officiating is all about angles and making quick decisions.\n\n\u201cNo one on the field has the benefit of slow-motion replays and lengthy looks at what just happened,\u201d says former NFL officiating chief Mike Pereira, now one of Fox\u2019s officiating analysts, along with his successor at the league, Dean Blandino. \u201cIt\u2019s bang-bang, all the time.\u201d\n\nAs it is in most sports that require rules enforcers. And replay, which is designed to, well, get things right, is not infallible. Or, the judgment of those watching replays and then making decisions isn\u2019t always perfect.\n\nMaybe the spotlight shines even brighter on the NFL because of all the eyeballs watching in the stands or on TV or streaming games - most of them critics with their own opinions on every play. Certainly the fact pro football draws the most wagering in the United States, and an officiating blunder can cost bettors tons of money, leads to hefty censure.\n\nThe league itself doesn\u2019t make it easy on its officials because there are so many (too many) rules, plus tangents and addendums to the rules. And because the NFL prizes experience in its crews, it winds up with older people who, frankly, can\u2019t always keep up.\n\nTo identify the NFL\u2019s officiating as the worst in pro sports, as we often hear when an egregious error such as the one in the NFC title game is made, probably is unfair - something Saints fans don\u2019t want to hear.\n\nCollege football has major issues, too, such as targeting. It shouldn\u2019t be easy to police and enforce, but the penalty is so punitive: ejection from the game.\n\nThe college version of replay allows everything reviewed, which can really slow the game; four-hour contests aren\u2019t unusual these days.\n\nA broader issue is officials are still employed by conferences and it creates an appearance of conflicts of interest, especially in nonconference games.\n\nConsider the other three most popular U.S. sports, too.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nIt\u2019s all balls and strikes now, exacerbated by the computer box that TV puts on the strike zone. If a single pitch misses by an inch, according to the box, and is called a strike, it becomes a war.\n\nSeveral players have been ejected in the past few weeks as games take on more importance. Many of the rants have come against Triple-A umpires filling in for vets on vacation or injured. The Yankees alone have had three notable blowups, all against Triple-A fill-ins at the plate - and they\u2019re one of MLB\u2019s best clubs.\n\nIt\u2019s ramped up, too, debate over using robot umpires. That\u2019s still way off in the future, although all the recent high-profile arguments make some think it\u2019s closer than once imagined.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nWithout question, referees and linesmen in the ice sport have the toughest jobs. Hey, they have to be able to skate as well as many of the players. Do you think NBA refs can hit 3-pointers like Steph Curry?\n\nThe NHL does the best job with replay because it\u2019s basically limited, with the main area of focus whether a goal was scored. The price for failed challenges can be more costly though, including winding up short-handed.\n\nNot quite as impactful as what happened in the Superdome, but close, was the entire officiating crew missing a hand pass in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, allowing Erik Karlsson to win the game. There were no remedies for the Blues, who went on to win the series and, perhaps, save the NHL the type of grief the NFL experienced last winter.\n\nBASKETBALL\n\nThe structure of the game, especially on the pro level, increases the difficulty of referees\u2019 tasks. Again, like the NFL, the NBA prefers experience in its officials. But the huge, powerful and quick players often gather in a confined space, especially in the lane. Trying to determine exactly what\u2019s going on is ultra-difficult.\n\nThen there are refs\u2019 interpretations of the rules. Is James Harden\u2019s step-back 3-point shot a travel, for instance? A player, again highlighting Harden, swinging his arms to draw contact before shooting a foul on him or the defense? The league basically put in a James Harden rule on that.\n\nNo call in any sport is tougher than the block/charge - particularly when defenders flop like soccer players.\n\nSee? Regardless of the sport, officiating is a demanding and thankless job.\n\n\u201cWell, I grew up with officiating,\u201d says John Parry, who left the field after 19 seasons and is now ESPN\u2019s analysts on the subject on Monday nights.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember a world without officiating or without the NFL. And I was taught early on, old school by my father, that your job is to go unnoticed. When they notice you, you have worked a poor football game. Make the calls, make the calls correct, be expeditious with what you announce and how you enforce.\u201d\n\nSeems the modern game has made that almost an impossible task.\n\n___\n\nAP Football Writer Ralph D.
