(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)\n\nColumnist\n\nMint. That\u2019s how the teens are already a step ahead of you on this whole vape thing, Washington Wonderminds.\n\nVaping can be deadly, we\u2019re learning, with a sixth death linked to the habit announced this week.\n\nSo the Trump administration announced that it wants to put the kibosh on the wicked marketing scheme to snare a whole generation into addiction by hooking kids on e-cigarettes with flavors like cotton candy, sour double rainbow or blue raspberry razzle dazzle.\n\n[Trump moves to ban fruit-flavored vape juice]\n\nThat little trend \u2014 where some of the packages of vape juice perfectly mimic popular candy \u2014 made high school bathrooms everywhere smell like the Willy Wonka factory. For a short time, that\u2019s been an easy tell for teachers.\n\nBut kids already figured out how to snow a teacher suspicious of a strawberry shortcake smelling locker room.\n\n\u201cBrah. Just do the mint. They\u2019ll just think you\u2019re chewing gum,\u201d is the current advice among the cracking voice population.\n\nThe Joe Camel 2.0 effort is a powerful one, and any move by leaders to quash it should be applauded. It was back in 1997, if you\u2019re old enough to recall, that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. paid out $10 million to consumers after it was made pretty clear in court that its cartoon Joe Camel campaign was all about growing a new generation of smokers.\n\nThen came the relentless, pummeling mix of lawsuits, government oversight and regulation, taxation and public health campaigns. It was one of the public health triumphs of our time.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, between 20 to 30 percent of high schoolers were regular cigarette smokers. (Anyone remember the smoking area at their high school? Ours was by the metal shop.) By 2018? A mere 7.6 percent of high schoolers puffed a real tobacco cigarette, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n[These graphic warnings work on non-smokers. But smokers? They just shrug.]\n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: A woman smokes a Juul e-cigarette in this posed picture, near Jerusalem September 16, 2018. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo (Ronen Zvulun/Reuters)\n\nSo a lot of us Gen-X parents thought we dodged a bullet on this one. Our kids HATE smoking. I\u2019ll never forget my sons\u2019 reactions when we went to Prague years ago for a family wedding, and they acted like a guy was eating a shoe off his plate when they saw a dignified, older man light up a cigarette at the table next to us in a bistro.\n\n\u201cEwww! Mom! He\u2019s smoking!!!\u201d the kids gasped.\n\nThen e-cigarettes showed up, and the kids seemed equally horrified by the Jimmy Buffet dude at a Chesapeake Bay restaurant sucking on an ornate vaping wand that looked like a metal, wizard wand. (Though I am totally on board with this as an alternative for any adult currently addicted to tobacco smoking. It\u2019s definitely the lesser of two evils, and I say that as someone married to a former smoker who has been chewing nicotine gum for almost two decades.)\n\nWhen it came to hating all smoking, most American kids heard the antismoking message loud and clear. Statistics showed that kids experimented with e-cigarettes for a couple years. Dabbling in high school seemed to peak in 2015, when about 16 percent of high schoolers said they were vapers.\n\nThe numbers dropped almost 30 percent by the next year. And it looked like this generation might ditch e-cigs as quickly as they left Maroon 5 or Facebook or Silly Banz.\n\nThen something weird happened: Vaping made a huge comeback, jumping by nearly 78 percent in the next two years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For middle schoolers, the jump was 48 percent. Yes, middle schoolers \u2014 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders. What happened?\n\nJuul happened. It\u2019s a brand of sleek and discreet e-cigarettes that look sort of like a long USB flashdrive and exactly like the iPhone charger I carry on my own key ring. (Yes, my kids freaked when they first saw it.) A single pod of watermelon, mango, strawberry lemonade and, yes, mint juice that goes into a Juul has as much nicotine as an entire pack of those old skool Camels.\n\nI took my tween to a concert last month at the state fair in Minnesota, and we were possibly the only two people in the crowd near the stage who weren\u2019t Juuling. It is everywhere. The CDC estimates that about 5 million kids are regularly doing it. It\u2019s so low-key, they do it in class and don\u2019t get caught.\n\n\u201cTeens were \u2018hitting the Juul\u2019 at home and at school, right under the noses of parents and guardians, teachers and coaches,\u201d said parent Meredith Berkman, who never noticed any weird smells in her son Caleb\u2019s room the whole time he was Juuling.\n\n\u201cThey were \u2018ripping the Juul\u2019 in school bathrooms \u2014 now called the \u2018Juul room\u2019\u2014 in locker rooms, even in classrooms in front of unsuspecting teachers,\u201d she told members of Congress at a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform in July. She is the founder of the year-old advocacy group PAVe, Parents Against Vaping e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cHow was it possible that there had been a teen cultural revolution, and most adults hadn\u2019t even noticed?\u201d she asked them.\n\nBecause this one is so easy to miss. Unlike the acrid smell of pot, Camels or cloves, this one is super stealth. Most kids I talk to parrot the e-cigarette manufacturer\u2019s message that vaping is not harmful, that e-cigarettes aren\u2019t as bad as anything we did in our youth. Wrong, wrong and wrong.\n\nThe congressional testimony included the written statement of Kristin Beauparlant, whose hockey-captain son, Cade, wrecked his lungs with his stealth habit and frightened his family with his addict behavior.\n\n[In the JUUL room: A teen habit that\u2019s all over the place]\n\nEven though the Massachusetts teen always denied it when she asked, Beauparlant learned that her son had been Juuling a pod a day for three years when he finally got caught doing it at school. That\u2019s a pack-a-day habit.\n\nPlease trust me, parents. Raid your kids\u2019 rooms, pockets and bags. Talk to them. Tell them how much damage nicotine does to their young, developing brains. Smell them. If their room smells like anything other than dirty socks or deodorant, wonder. If the room smells like any food (there are even maple French toast, cinnamon roll and cucumber flavors) and they haven\u2019t been cooking, worry. And if they suddenly smell a lot like mint, now you know why.\n\nOkay, Washington. That\u2019s one step. Now, we\u2019ve got about 38,000 deaths every year by gunfire.\n\nReady to talk about that, too?\n\nTwitter: @petulad", "description": "Vaping is everywhere.
