That's why Cronos focuses on intellectual property and brands, using the same \"asset light\" model that established consumer goods and pharmaceutical companies use.\n\nWhen asked about the recent vaping controversy, Gorenstein noted that nicotine and cannabis are very different products and in Canada, cannabis vaping products are not yet allowed to be sold.\n\nCramer said when you speculate on a stock like Cronos, you're going to get ups and downs like the industry has seen over the past year.\n\nLet's check out the ups and downs of the charts.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of CRON, below, we can see the seven-month slide in prices. CRON is now below the declining 50-day moving average line and the cresting 200-day line. In early August the 50-day line moved below the 200-day line for what is commonly called a dead or death cross.\n\nTrading volume was heavy into the run up to $25 in early February but it has been light since the peak and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has only declined modestly telling us that prices have fallen of their own weight.\n\nThe 12-day price momentum study in the lower panel has not yet shown us a bullish divergence to suggest that the decline is slowing.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of CRON, below, we can see that if you recognized the cannabis rally early and exited as prices turned parabolic you probably made some handsome returns. Timing is key. CRON is now below the cresting 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is pointed down and tells us, unlike the daily chart, that sellers have been more aggressive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bearish mode below the zero line.\n\nIn this daily Point and Figure chart of CRON, below, we can see a downside price target of $10.58. The $10-$8 area is probably next chart support.\n\nBottom-line strategy: CRON is pointed down and we could see prices drift into the $10-$8 area in the weeks ahead. Wait for a new base to develop before considering a long position.", "description": "Shares of the cannabis company Cronos Group are likely to drift lower in the weeks ahead....CRON", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Cronos Group Is Still Coming Down Its High", "Shares Of The Cannabis Company Are Likely To Drift Lower In The Weeks Ahead.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bob Ciura", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Jim Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/fbdae512-1e59-11e9-9f64-93d6ebfc9fad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
