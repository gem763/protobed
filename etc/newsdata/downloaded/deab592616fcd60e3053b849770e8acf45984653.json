I didn\u2019t do that. I wanted to make sure this kept secret,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have people lost.\u201d\n\nPelosi issued a statement after al-Baghdadi's death was announced, criticizing Trump for not informing leaders in Congress beforehand.\n\n\"The House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region,\" Pelosi said. \"Our military and allies deserve strong, smart and strategic leadership from Washington.\"\n\nTrump said that he did notify Russia beforehand that the U.S. would be active in the region, because Russia currently has a presence there. The president said he did not reveal the purpose of the mission.\n\nPence downplayed Trump\u2019s decision to keep Pelosi in the dark in an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday\" immediately following Trump\u2019s address. The vice president claimed that Trump did not mean to say he did not trust the House Speaker.\n\nISIS LEADER'S DEATH MARKS LATEST DEFEAT OF ONCE-POWERFUL GROUP\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that was the implication at all,\u201d Pence said. When pressed on the issue, the vice president said, \u201cWe maintain the tightest possible security here,\u201d and focused on Trump\u2019s goal, which was to bring al-Baghdadi to justice.\n\nBefore fielding the question about Pelosi, Trump had said that the only ones who knew about the operation beforehand \u201cwere the few people I dealt with.\u201d He mentioned Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley as some of those with whom he worked.\n\nCongressional sources from the Republican side told Fox News they were notified about the raid Saturday night, but it was unclear if this was before or after it took place.\n\nTrump said he spoke about the operation with certain individuals like Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Sunday morning, but that he did not tell any of them beforehand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve notified some, others are being notified now as I speak,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe were going to notify them last night but we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe president went on to call Washington, D.C. \u201ca leaking machine, and said he decided \u201cwe will not notify them until our great people are out,\u201d because \u201cI don\u2019t want to have them greeted with firepower like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\nTrump touted the success of the operation, and how no members of the U.S. forces were killed, with just one military dog injured.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump stated Sunday morning that he did not tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the U.S. military raid in Syria that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi because he was worried about leaks that could have compromised the mission.
