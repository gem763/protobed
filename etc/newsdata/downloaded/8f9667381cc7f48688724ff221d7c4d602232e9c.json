If you are among the many affected travellers, what happens now?\n\nIf you are abroad on a Thomas Cook holiday, will you be flown back home?\n\nYes, according to the foreign secretaryl, Dominic Raab, who told the BBC that contingency planning was in place to make sure no-one would be stranded. The repatriation plan, which has been codenamed Operation Matterhorn, will involve planes chartered from other airlines including British Airways and easyJet. The operation is likely to be a mammoth challenge for the Civil Aviation Authority, on a scale significantly larger than the last major collapse, when Monarch Airlines was grounded in October 2017.\n\nThomas Cook travel chaos: insolvency leaves 150,000 stranded on holidays \u2013 live updates Read more\n\nThe initial advice is likely to be that holidaymakers should not make their way to the airport until notified, as flights are unlikely to be available immediately. Be prepared for possible delays, and the risk that you may be flown back to a different UK airport to the one you took off from, then bussed to your initial departure point.\n\nHowever, the good news is that the Monarch rescue went relatively smoothly. Over the course of two weeks in October 2017 the CAA chartered 560 flights from 24 different airlines, and 98% of Monarch passengers were flown home on the same day they were originally booked to return.\n\nThe hotel you are in wants you to pay extra. What should you do?\n\nHotel groups are generally paid by the tour companies 60 to 90 days after the travellers have already taken their holidays. Now that Thomas Cook has collapsed, some hotels may ask holidaymakers either to leave, or pay extra to remain in the hotel.\n\nThe CAA said it was contacting hoteliers and other companies likely to be affected by the Thomas Cook collapse to assure them they will be paid. It added that \u201cif holidaymakers are being asked to settle bills they should contact us and we will deal with it.\u201d Thomas Cook package holiday customers are covered by Atol \u2013 Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence \u2013 which protects accommodation and return flights.\n\nYou have a booking with Thomas Cook for a holiday next week. What happens to it?\n\nIt\u2019s very likely you won\u2019t be jetting off to the sun, but you will get the money back that you paid for the Thomas Cook holiday. The CAA will set out how to make a claim for a refund \u2013 go to caa.co.uk/atol-protection/\n\nIn some circumstances, Atol may appoint what it calls a \u201cfulfilment partner\u201d to provide the holiday instead, although this is more likely for holidays booked further in advance.\n\nAre you covered if you have bought a flight-only deal on Thomas Cook Airlines?\n\nUnlikely. Atol was set up to protect holidaymakers who buy package deals, not people putting together holidays on their own over the internet. But there can be some exceptions, such as if the passenger bought the ticket through an Atol licenced travel agent. However, if you booked directly with the airline it is unlikely you will be covered. When XL crashed in 2008, the CAA said flight-only customers were at the back of the queue, and that while it would make efforts to organise cost-only seats, it would not offer any guarantees.\n\nIf you are flight-only, will your travel insurance or credit card company pay up instead?\n\nIt depends if the policy includes cover for \u201cscheduled airline failure insurance\u201d (Safi) or \u201csupplier failure\u201d. If it does, you\u2019re covered. But most cheap travel policies, including many that come as part of a packaged bank account, generally do not include this level of cover. if you have booked a flight on your credit card you are covered by the so-called \u201csection 75\u201d cover under the Consumer Credit Act. To be eligible, you need to have paid more than \u00a3100 for your flight, and used your credit card to book direct, although some card companies extend the cover to bookings via agents.\n\nIs there a chance that Atol itself will go bust and you won\u2019t get a pay out?\n\nAs at 31 March 2018 the Air Travel Trust fund, which finances Atol payouts, had a surplus of \u00a3170m, and a \u00a3400m insurance policy of its own in place to handle events such as the collapse of Thomas Cook. But it will still be a major test for the fund. The good news is that Atol is run by the government-backed CAA, so should it be overwhelmed with Thomas Cook claims, the government would be under intense pressure to step in.", "description": "All you need to know about the venerable travel firm\u2019s fall into administration", "authors": ["Patrick Collinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c5e33ff8966ba45c1429eea0153db00c88791ea/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c415745e8b2f8cfb7351f0b00d486ed8", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
