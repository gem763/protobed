Speech", "language": "en", "text": "Pakistan\u2019s leader castigated India over its Kashmir crackdown from the podium of the United Nations on Friday, warning of a \u201cbloodbath\u201d when and if Indian authorities lift a curfew over the disputed territory.\n\nThe speech by Prime Minister Imran Khan at the United Nations General Assembly was partly directed at his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, who in his own speech earlier Friday omitted any reference to Kashmir.\n\nLast month India revoked the long-standing autonomy of the mountainous border region, the flashpoint of two wars with Pakistan since both achieved independence from Britain more than 70 years ago.\n\nIndian authorities arrested thousands of Kashmiris, severed most electronic access and imposed a curfew on the entire populace of about 8 million. While some curbs have been eased, the curfew remains in effect.\n\nModi and his subordinates have described their move as an internal domestic matter aimed at making the region more prosperous.\n\nThe Indian prime minister\u2019s shift on Kashmir was welcomed by his base of Hindu nationalists, who have long wanted to exert power in the Muslim-majority region and have long accused Pakistan of supporting militant separatists there.\n\nKhan has repeatedly denounced what he has described as Modi\u2019s reckless disregard of Pakistan\u2019s historic claims to the region.\n\nThe Pakistani leader has frequently reminded the world that Pakistan and India are both nuclear powers. He has used terms like genocide to describe India\u2019s intentions for the disputed Kashmir region and has complained that Modi has ignored his entreaties for a dialogue.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times Editorial Board on Wednesday, Khan said Modi was leading India down an irrational path, a theme he reiterated in his General Assembly speech.\n\n\u201cIs it arrogance that has blinded him from what is going to happen when the curfew is lifted? Does he think the people of Kashmir will quietly accept the status quo?\u201d Khan said. \u201cWhat is going to happen when the curfew is lifted will be a bloodbath.\u201d\n\nThe pent-up frustration of Kashmiris living under what Khan described as Indian military occupation would inevitably come back to haunt India, he said.\n\n\u201cWould I want to live like that?\u201d Khan said. \u201cI would pick up a gun.\u201d\n\nKhan, who has conspicuously avoided crossing paths with Modi while both are attending the annual gathering in New York, had said that he would be using his General Assembly speech to emphasize Kashmir and implore the United Nations to intervene.\n\nModi, in his speech, sought to portray India as a peace-loving nation that he said had given the world Buddha\u2019s philosophy of serenity. His only reference to Pakistan and Kashmir was oblique, saying India had long been a victim of terrorism.\n\n\u201cOur voice against terrorism, to alert the world about this evil, rings with seriousness and the outrage,\u201d Modi said. \u201cIt is absolutely imperative that the world unites against terrorism.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Pakistan's leader castigated India over its Kashmir crackdown from the podium of the United Nations on Friday, warning of a \"bloodbath\" when and if Indian authorities lift a curfew over the disputed territory.The speech by Prime Minister Imran Khan at the United Nations General Assembly", "authors": ["Rick Gladstone", "Kelly Virella"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kF2DFysjHxGKYOtleSQmtg--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/7dd502c0-e2e9-11e9-b3ff-5b3d903aaa6c", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
