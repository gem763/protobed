In letters to Vice President Pence and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, demanded answers by Friday to questions about what they knew, when they knew it, and their roles in President Trump\u2019s actions regarding Ukraine.\n\n[Read Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s letter to the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee]\n\nBut much of the day\u2019s turmoil centered on Pompeo, who said in a letter to the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees heading the investigation that five State Department officials called to give depositions over the next two weeks would not appear as scheduled.\n\nPompeo characterized the effort to depose the officials as \u201can attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly, the distinguished professionals of the Department of State.\u201d\n\nSaying that Congress had no authority to compel such testimony, Pompeo wrote that he would \u201cnot tolerate such tactics, and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the day, however, at least one of the five, former administration envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, planned to appear anyway before the committees Thursday. A second official, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, would appear on Oct. 11, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss lawmakers\u2019 deliberations.\n\n[Kurt Volker, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, resigns]\n\nMeanwhile, the committees were notified that the State Department\u2019s inspector general has requested to speak with them on Wednesday \u201cto discuss and provide staff with copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine,\u201d according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nState Department Inspector General Steve Linick, whose office is responsible for investigating abuse and mismanagement in the department and operates largely independently from its control, \u201cobtained the documents from the acting legal advisor of the Department of State,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe inspector general does not have to seek Pompeo\u2019s approval to approach lawmakers with information, especially if the material is not classified.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what Linick will provide the committees. But the demand for any credible information related to Ukraine and the State Department is at a fever pitch as Democrats seek to build the case for Trump\u2019s ouster out of his newly revealed dealings with the government of Ukraine.\n\n[Whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office and that White House officials tried to cover it up]\n\nThe inquiry centers on a whistleblower complaint, made public last week, alleging that Trump manipulated U.S. foreign policy for political gain, withholding aid to Ukraine while pressing its government to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden and his son. That charge appeared to be borne out in a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.\n\nTrump, who had put a hold on nearly $400 million in U.S. military assistance to aid Ukraine in resisting Russian incursions in its territory, urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal attorney, and Attorney General William P. Barr in investigating Biden. He has charged that the former vice president intervened to squelch a corruption investigation of a Ukrainian company that employed his son, although Ukrainian officials have said Hunter Biden was not implicated in the investigation, which was later abandoned.\n\n[Trump ordered hold on military aid days before calling Ukrainian president, officials say]\n\nPompeo\u2019s letter followed reports that the secretary, who has sought to publicly distance himself from Trump\u2019s Ukraine activities, was a participant in the July 25 call by Trump to Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment investigation.\n\nThe committee chairmen responded to Pompeo with their own broadside, saying any attempt to prevent department officials from speaking to them \u201cis illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction,\u201d according to a statement issued by Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), who heads the foreign affairs panel.\n\nThe State Department depositions will take place behind closed doors, and there has been no word on whether a transcript would be released. Volker, who the committee official said \u201chas confirmed he will appear,\u201d did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nYovanovitch will appear with her personal legal counsel, the official said. She was recalled by Pompeo as ambassador to Ukraine in May, before the end of her tour. In his call with Zelensky, according to the White House transcript, Trump said Yovanovitch was \u201cbad news,\u201d apparently because she had resisted the investigation of Biden he was seeking.\n\n[Giuliani pursued shadow Ukraine agenda as key foreign policy officials were sidelined]\n\nIn his letter to the committees, Pompeo did not outright refuse to allow the officials to testify, but said that they and the department had been given \u201ca woefully inadequate opportunity\u201d to prepare. They must also consult with, and be accompanied to any deposition by, State Department counsel \u201cregarding the Department\u2019s legitimate interests in safeguarding potentially privileged and classified information,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIt was unclear what recourse was available to him to prevent them from appearing, or to discipline those who decided to speak.\n\nOther State Department officials scheduled for depositions include Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl. It was unclear whether they would appear.\n\nPompeo has publicly brushed off questions about the whistleblower\u2019s account, has been frustrated by Giuliani\u2019s efforts to implicate the State Department in his activities and insisted that it did nothing improper. Giuliani has said repeatedly that the department assisted his interactions with Ukrainian officials in pursuit of incriminating information on Biden, and a separate, but widely debunked, allegation that foreign interference in the 2016 election had come from Ukraine, rather than Russia.\n\n\u201cI have 40 texts from State Department officials asking me to do what I did,\u201d Giuliani said in a Post interview last week. \u201cThe entire idea that I did this on my own is total and complete bulls---.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower says the State Department was concerned about my activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have been. They knew what I was doing.\u201d\n\nPompeo, in addition to expressing concern to some in the White House over Giuliani\u2019s frequent interviews and television appearances on Trump\u2019s behalf, had argued against release of the Zelensky transcript, as did Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the issue\u2019s sensitivity.\n\nTrump, however, appreciates Giuliani\u2019s tenacity and outspokenness, said a former senior official. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t differentiate between who is in the government and who isn\u2019t,\u201d the former official said.\n\nOn Friday, the committees also subpoenaed Pompeo over what they said was his failure to respond to previous requests to produce documents related to the inquiry. Pompeo left the country late Monday on a week-long trip to Europe.\n\nIn a morning Twitter barrage, Trump repeated his insistence, despite information in the White House rough transcript, that almost everything the whistleblower said about it was \u201cwrong,\u201d and asked \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all the false information to him?\u201d\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who broadly paraphrased the call during a hearing last week, had \u201cmade up\u201d a version of the exchange, Trump said. He questioned why Schiff wasn\u2019t being \u201cbrought up on charges.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, others entered the fray. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said the impeachment inquiry could expand beyond Ukraine. Impeachment, she said, \u201cis not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned and placed in solitary confinement.\u201d\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel accused House Democrats of attempting \u201ca legislative coup d\u2019etat\u201d to get rid of Trump.", "description": "Pompeo and House Democrats trade threats over plan to interview State Dept. officials who played a role in U.S. relations with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tWE0D9mv7b7IVBz3_T2fxEp2MlE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EXLJHYXELYI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
