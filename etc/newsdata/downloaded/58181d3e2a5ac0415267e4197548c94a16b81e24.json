We found out.", "language": "en", "text": "THE PROGNOSIS\n\nFormer Health and Human services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who has advised Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on her Medicare-for-all plan. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nAs Sen. Elizabeth Warren often says, \u201cpersonnel is policy.\u201d And that's why the advisers drafting the 2020 Democrats' proposals to expand health coverage for 30 million uninsured Americans are so important.\n\nThe candidates have a deep bench to draw from. The top-polling campaigns have reached out to a host of alumni from the Obama and Clinton administrations, who have practical experience from rolling out the 2010 Affordable Care Act and making an initial pass at health-care restructuring back in the 1990s.\n\nThey include household names in the health policy world: Clinton veteran Chris Jennings, former Obama Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden, and Andy Slavitt, former director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The former officials say they\u2019re happy to distribute advice equally.\n\n\u201cI have agreed to be helpful to any campaign who wants me to review their health proposals,\u201d Slavitt, who headed CMS in the Obama administration\u2019s last few years, told me.\n\nThe best-funded candidates have also added health policy advisers to their payrolls and contacted academics and others as they\u2019ve rolled out proposals to expand health-care coverage and improve rural and maternal health. Political campaigns generally seek to keep the focus on the candidate, so most were reticent to share names of staffers or outside advisers.\n\nSo The Health 202 did a little sleuthing -- and several campaigns confirmed names we sent their way. Here\u2019s a look at some lesser-known individuals helping to shape policy for the top contenders.\n\nBiden, Warren and Harris arrive on stage for the third 2020 Democratic primary debate. (Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.):\n\nHarris has struggled throughout the campaign to define exactly where she stands on the role of private insurance. She surprised many by releasing an alternative Medicare-for-all proposal that would preserve private plans by letting them contract with the government to administer medical benefits.\n\nHarris's campaign confirmed that Rohini Kosoglu, her Senate chief of staff, volunteered her time to help develop that plan. Kosoglu served as senior health care adviser to Sen. Michael Bennett (D-Colo.) while the ACA was being debated and passed.\n\nBrookings Institution fellow Kavita Patel said \u2014 and the campaign confirmed \u2014 that she also advised the campaign in a voluntary role. Patel served as a policy director in the Obama administration and advised then-Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) on health policy.\n\nHarris has also touted influence and support from Kathleen Sebelius for her plan.\n\nButtigieg talks with attendees at the Hawkeye Area Labor Council Labor Day Picnic in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nSouth Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg:\n\nLike Harris, Buttigieg is another candidate who has softened his stance on Medicare-for-all by saying he prefers something he calls \u201cMedicare-for-all-who-want-it\u201d \u2014 although he hasn\u2019t yet released details on what such a system might look like.\n\nThe campaign has relied heavily on a group of volunteers to help develop its health policy proposals. That group is led by Cristal Thomas Gary, who, as former deputy governor of Illinois, helped the state set up its ACA marketplace and improve its Medicaid program. Andres Arguello, formerly a health research analyst at the New Jersey-based firm Mathematica, is also a key part of the group, according to the campaign.\n\nButtigieg has released a proposal for improving rural health (we detailed that here) and a proposal on mental health. The mental health paper was heavily influenced by Ben Miller, chief policy officer for the Well Being Trust. Miller released notable research in March finding \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d from alcohol and drug abuse more than doubled since 1999.\n\nInside the campaign, Buttigieg draws ideas from his policy director Sonal Shah, who worked in the Obama White House leading its Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation and most recently directed Georgetown University\u2019s Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden:\n\nBiden was one of the first Democrats to offer his own health-care proposal, which would let anyone choose to buy a government-backed plan such as Medicare. He has the advantage of drawing from the expertise of policy staff who advised him during his years at the White House.\n\nHis campaign policy director is Stef Feldman, an adviser during his vice presidency on health care, energy and the environment. Feldman helped the Obama-Biden administration weather one of its toughest moments \u2014 the 2013 botched rollout of Healthcare.gov \u2014 as one of the White House staffers who helped triage resulting problems.\n\nFeldman also led an Obama administration task force that put together 19 executive actions taken by the Defense Department and Veterans Affairs to improve the mental health of service members, veterans and their families.\n\nSarah Bianchi, a veteran policy staffer who worked in the Clinton and Obama White Houses and directed policy for the Kerry-Edwards presidential campaign, is also cited as a top influencer on Biden\u2019s policies. She served as head of economic and domestic policy for Biden when he was vice president, and chairs the advisory board for the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware.\n\nBianchi wrote a Medium post last year after John McCain's death, praising the former Arizona Republican for his bipartisan work to pass the Patient's Bill of Rights with then-Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.).\n\nShe listed four \u201clessons\u201d to be learned from McCain's actions, including \u201ctake issues but never take yourself too seriously; Enter the arena and fight for what you believe \u2014 even if it\u2019s messy and imperfect; Be grateful for all the experiences, adventures and friendships \u2014 and even for the bad days; Own your failures. It\u2019s okay to say, \u2018I screwed up. I got this wrong\u2019 and then learn and emerge stronger and better.\u201d\n\nNo more decent, compassionate leader to lead us into the future https://t.co/s8r1EOsE1S \u2014 Sarah Bianchi (@SarahABianchi) April 25, 2019\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nSanders \u2014 author of the first Medicare-for-all bill \u2014 relies more heavily on longtime Senate staff than outside advisers, according to those in Democratic circles. As an independent who embraces the term \u201csocialist,\u201d Sanders has long forged his own pathway on health-care policy and is less likely to draw from mainstream Democratic ideas to inform his views.\n\nLori Kearns, who has worked for Sanders since 2012, served as Sanders\u2019s health policy adviser as his office was writing Medicare-for-all back in 2015. She became his Senate legislative director in March.\n\nto be fair, there are a lot of people who can't tell the difference between a premium and a deductible, and this is why arguing we need \"choice\" in health insurance plans is so useless https://t.co/xPTGX9yS1W \u2014 Lori Kearns (@lori_kearns) September 13, 2019\n\nEvery time I yell at the TV my dog demands belly rubs. It's a decent trade pic.twitter.com/PgkqxxZ5Vv \u2014 Lori Kearns (@lori_kearns) September 14, 2019\n\nOther Senate staff who have worked for Sanders on health policy in the Senate include Marissa Barrera, who has been a health policy analyst since 2016 for the Budget Committee, where Sanders serves as the ranking Democrat. Kathryn Van Haste is the committee\u2019s health policy director.\n\nSanders's most out-front policy staffer for 2020 is Warren Gunnels, who is a senior campaign adviser and was policy director in Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign. He has worked for Sanders for two decades.\n\nHey Joe: How do you propose to come up with the $50 trillion $750 billion you want to spend on health care over the next 10 years? Because that\u2019s what the status quo and your damn public option is going to cost which will put profits before people. https://t.co/Kk9ClbYiCh \u2014 Warren Gunnels (@GunnelsWarren) September 13, 2019\n\nElizabeth Warren (D-Mass.):\n\nSeveral health policy experts who advise multiple campaigns said they interact more directly with Warren than any of the other candidates, underscoring the Harvard professor\u2019s deep involvement with the details of policy and reputation for having a \u201cplan\u201d for everything.\n\nAndy Slavitt said he offered some help on her plan for maternal health, which would reward hospitals for reducing their maternal mortality rate among black women. \"She is highly engaged personally on these topics,\" Slavitt told me.\n\nAnd she is reported to pay her campaign\u2019s policy director Jon Donenberg as much as the campaign manager and other senior leaders, reflecting her commitment to policy development. Jon was a health policy staffer for the Energy and Commerce Committee during passage of the ACA, where he worked on the part of the legislation involving Medicaid expansion and the Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n\nOne of Warren\u2019s longtime go-to advisers is Ganesh Sitaraman, a law professor at Vanderbilt University and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. He\u2019s not paid by her campaign but is reported to heavily influence her domestic policies.\n\nWarren hasn\u2019t released her own plan for expanding health insurance, instead endorsing Sanders\u2019s Medicare-for-all. But in August she posted ideas for improving rural health care beyond Medicare-for-all\u2019s coverage expansions.\n\nAnd last week her campaign posted a new Web page detailing legislation Warren has proposed to combat the opioid crisis and lower prescription drug costs, and laying out ideas for improving rural health.\n\nYou are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy. Not a regular subscriber?\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nAHH: Purdue Pharma, the company behind the opioid Oxycontin that\u2019s accused of fueling the opioid epidemic, has filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cThe Chapter 11 filing is expected to lead to the ultimate demise of a company that sold a fraction of the opioid prescriptions in the United States but nonetheless is most closely identified with the epidemic because of its pioneering role in the sale of narcotic pain pills,\u201d our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports. \u201cThe company used aggressive, allegedly misleading, sales tactics to push physicians to prescribe millions of doses of its dangerously addictive pills.\"\n\nThe filing will lead to new discussions over how any proceeds from a settlement with thousands of complainants will be divided up as well as how much of the fortunes from the Purdue-owning Sackler family will be available to help pay plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cUnder the settlement announced last week, more than 2,000 small government plaintiffs and 24 states have agreed to the dissolution of the company and a contribution from the Sacklers, valued at $10 billion to $12 billion. But the settlement valuation is in dispute, and a number of states have balked at those terms,\u201d Christopher writes. Under the settlement, Purdue would shift during bankruptcy into a trust that aims to combat the opioid epidemic by producing opioid overdose rescue medicines that would be doled out to impacted communities.\n\nThe Sackler family called the settlement and bankruptcy a \u201chistoric step\u2019\u2019 to address a \u201ctragic public health situation.\u2019\u2019 \u201cIt is our hope the bankruptcy reorganization process that is now underway will end our ownership of Purdue and ensure its assets are dedicated for the public benefit,\u2019\u2019 the statement said.\n\n\u2014 The New York attorney general\u2019s office disclosed that the Sackler family participated in 137 wire transfers totaling about $1 billion, the New York Times\u2019s Danny Hakim reports. The revelation suggests the family was looking to protect its wealth in overseas bank accounts as it faces lawsuits.\n\n\"Letitia James, now the state\u2019s attorney general, had issued subpoenas last month to 33 financial institutions and investment advisers with ties to the Sacklers in an effort to trace the full measure of the family\u2019s wealth,\u201d Danny writes. \u201c\u2026Forbes has estimated that the family fortune is worth $13 billion, a figure the family has not disputed, but many state attorneys general believe that the family has far more hidden away, as a safeguard against the cascade of litigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the Sacklers continue to lowball victims and skirt a responsible settlement, we refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct,\u201d James said in a statement.\n\n(Keith Srakocic/AP)\n\nOOF: Drug companies facing 2,000 lawsuits over their alleged roles in the opioid crisis now want the judge overseeing the case to be removed.\n\nLawyers for the companies filed a request on Saturday to remove U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster in the landmark trial scheduled to begin next month, questioning his fairness, our Post colleagues Scott Higham and Lenny Bernstein report. The lawyers pointed to his statements made at the start of the trial that urged for both sides in the case to settle, citing the urgent need for funding from a settlement to benefit opioid-ravaged communities.\n\n\u201cLawyers for the more than 2,000 cities, towns, counties and tribal communities suing the drug industry called the attempt to remove Polster a desperate move,\u201d Scott and Lenny write. \u201cThe lead plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said in a statement they \u2018remain confident the judiciary will swiftly respond to yet another attempt by the opioid defendants to delay the trial.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOUCH: A 58-year-old Navy veteran brought a $139,000 hospital bill to a campaign rally for Sanders, waving it in the air until it caught the attention of a campaign aide who passed the bill to the candidate. It led to a harrowing exchange between Sanders and one of his supporters, who has advanced-stage Huntington\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cJohn, I\u2019m looking at a bill that says account balance $139,000. What is that about?\u201d Sanders asked the veteran, John Weigel.\n\nWeigel explained: \u201cIt\u2019s because somehow after the fact they claim that my Tricare, I chose to end it, which I didn\u2019t\u2026 They\u2019re saying that I didn\u2019t re-sign it or something.\u201d\n\nWhen Sanders asked how Weigel planned to pay off the bill, he answered: \u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t\u2026I\u2019m going to kill myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold it, John,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cStop it. You\u2019re not going to kill yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cReached at his home Saturday afternoon, Weigel said he spoke to Sanders and his wife, Jane Sanders, after the event and they told him they would help, though they didn\u2019t say how,\u201d our Post colleague Colby Itkowitz reports. \u201cLater Saturday, the Sanders campaign said it had \u2018already reached out to a Nevada senate office for casework help.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWeigel told Colby that he was told by his Tricare health insurance, which he signed up for after retiring from the military, that the coverage was canceled because he hadn\u2019t re-enrolled, despite having his coverage automatically renewed in past years. He\u2019s back on his insurance, but still doesn\u2019t know how he was kicked off.\n\n\u201cSince the town hall, Sanders has tweeted several times about Weigel, holding him up as an example of a broken health-care system,\u201d Colby writes:\n\nThis is painful to hear. But there are millions of people like John facing an unimaginable burden due to the cost of medical care. This is why we fight for Medicare for All.\n\n\n\nContent warning: suicide pic.twitter.com/gtCtNykvqO \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 14, 2019\n\nHEALTH ON THE HILL\n\nRep.

Ill. (Taylor Glascock for The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 At least a dozen children diagnosed with autism were conceived using the same donor sperm, something Danielle Rizzo, a mother of two boys on the spectrum discovered while researching treatment options three years ago, our Post colleague Ariana Eunjung Cha reports in this extraordinary piece.\n\nExperts say the revelation of an autism cluster that involves the group of children across the United States, Canada and Europe is unprecedented.\n\nRizzo searched online and found the man\u2019s sperm was still being sold at four companies, contacting the companies but receiving a minimal response from representatives who told her she didn\u2019t have \u201cevidence\u201d that the sperm was the cause of the autism cluster. She contacted health-care regulators in New York and California who also denied responsibility. And the Food and Drug Administration told her its oversight of the industry was limited to screening for sexually transmitted diseases. Finally, Rizzo filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in July 2017.\n\n\u201cShe says in the complaint that research, based on public documents and calls to his relatives, showed that the donor had no college degrees, had been diagnosed with ADHD, and \u2018went to a school for children with learning and emotional disabilities,\u2019 \u201d Ariana reports. \u201cMoreover, her attorneys wrote in the filing, \u2018Donor H898 is a prolific sperm donor who has fathered at least 12 children through sperm donation, and that each of those children has either been diagnosed with Autism, or suffers from signs and symptoms associated with Autism.\u2019 In court documents, other mothers corroborated the story.\u201d\n\nRizzo, who agreed to a settlement in March, said she wants her case to prompt greater oversight of sperm bank industry. \u201cI did not sue because my children are autistic. I was suing to right a wrong,\u201d she told Ariana.\n\nAGENCY ALERT\n\n(Mypurgatoryyears/(iStock))\n\n\u2014 The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s advisory committee voted 7 to 2 to greenlight a first-of-its-kind peanut allergy treatment, which could be a step toward more such allergy treatments that aim to prevent allergic reactions rather than just treat them, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports.\n\nThe biotech company behind the drug wants to get the therapy approved for kids ages 4 to 17.\n\nThe drug \u2014 called Palforzia \u2014 would not be a cure, but would desensitize children to what can be life-threatening allergies.
