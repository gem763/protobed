HPEF did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThree months of increasingly violent protests in Hong Kong began as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill, but have developed into a broader backlash against the government and have left the city facing its first recession in a decade.\n\nOn Sunday, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators in the Central business district - home of many TEC offices - as well as the upmarket Causeway Bay shopping district.\n\nTEC, founded in 1994, operates more than 130 offices in 32 cities across 14 countries in Asia and the Middle East, it says on its website.\n\nHong Kong accounts for about 30% of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), according to the source.\n\nThe company is 70% owned by HPEF - formerly HSBC's Asian private equity arm until a buyout in 2010 - 20% by CVC and 10% by management.\n\nNo price has been made public, but the Financial Times reported in April the company was seeking a valuation of more than $750 million.\n\nTEC is on course to produce EBITDA of $46 million for 2019, according to the source.\n\nIts sale pause also comes as loss-making WeWork, a U.S.-headquartered office provider, has more than halved the valuation it expects from a New York initial public offering to a little over $20 billion, from the $47 billion it achieved in a private fundraising this year.\n\nUnlike WeWork, which has focused on offering short-term space to start-ups and tech companies, TEC has focused on longer-term leases to a client roster of multinationals.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jennifer Hughes in Hong Kong; Editing by Robert Birsel)", "description": "Office space provider The Executive Centre (TEC) has paused its sale process over fears that its large Hong Kong exposure could weigh on its valuation as sometimes violent protests continue in the city for a third month, according to a source.
