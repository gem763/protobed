Fine show 5/10min of ads & trailers, but this inflation to 33mins isn't on. Either cut pre-screening times, or tell us actual start times too.\n\n'RT if u agree.'\n\nThe tweet sparked a huge response as some 54,000 people retweeted in agreement while 78,100 social media users shared their opinions.\n\nHot Fuzz director Edgar Wright even waded in, adding: 'Agree with this one hundred percent. In the UK the amount of commercials (less so trailers) before a movie is insane. 30 mins is way too long.'\n\nAmerican filmmaker Kyle R Smith added: 'I also don't need a 5 minute ad telling me how great the theater I'm currently sitting in is.'\n\nHot Fuzz director Edgar Wright even waded in, adding: 'Agree with this one hundred percent'\n\nAmerican filmmaker Kyle R Smith also aired his views on the debate\n\nAnother twitter user added: 'As a deaf person, it's annoying because when I go to see a captioned film (they are only shown at limited times/days) the trailers are not captioned so I have to sit there unable to follow. I usually turn up late, but like you say it would be helpful to know the film start time.'\n\nOthers said they were forced to pay babysitters extra to get to the cinema on time - only to spend half an hour watching adverts.\n\nSuzanne Latus-Woods said: 'This boils my blood. I don\u2019t wish to be advertised to for 30+ minutes.
