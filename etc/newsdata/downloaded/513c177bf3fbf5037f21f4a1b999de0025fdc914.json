We just don't know how much and when.'\n\nIt added: 'An orderly wind-up is the best way forward.'\n\nBut it said this may also be difficult to stomach for investors, who may have to wait for 'several years' for assets to be sold at a decent price and their money returned.\n\nThe investment bank predicted any new manager is also likely to impose an annual management charge, as well as a performance fee if it delivers decent returns.\n\nThe trust currently only charges a performance fee, which investors have not been paying because it has fared so poorly.", "description": "Despairing investors in Patient Capital Trust are in danger of incurring even bigger losses if they hang on to their shares, analysts warned yesterday.
