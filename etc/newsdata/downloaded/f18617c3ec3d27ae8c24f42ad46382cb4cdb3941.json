Or whatever it is. It\u2019s about as relevant and vital to me as Emmerdale, although the acting in the Yorkshire village is rather more believable than the one in Westminster.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

If Samantha Cameron feels as betrayed as her husband at Sarah Vine's perfidy, so what ? If David can no longer trust George Osborne, who cares? A small earthquake in Notting Hill: few injuries, and no one died.\n\nExcept, as I say, that the dynastic nepotistic dynamics are damaging the lives of families far less able to withstand the impact of Brexit.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Sarah Vine (also known as the wife of Michael Gove) has got the dirty washing out all over again. Forgive me if I find it all a bit remote.\n\nOne of the things that Theresa May found most distasteful about the so-called \"Notting Hill set\" was that its members viewed politics as a game, in which the national interest was always being discarded in favour of some scam to trick the opposition, and where personal rivalries were allowed to drive policy choices. We know now, and fairly conclusively, how right she was to distrust them. (She was not their type.)\n\nIt seems, above all, pretty clear that Boris Johnson only decided to join the Leave campaign in 2016 because he calculated that it would lose but that he would emerge as the darling of the Conservative party. As Cameron says, he never previously argued in favour of, nor believed philosophically, in Brexit. Similarly, Gove was only as energetic and prominent in the Leave campaign because his old friend David had demoted him from education secretary to chief whip and \"failed to acknowledge\" his leadership ambitions \u2013 slays referring to Osborne as his chosen obvious successor.\n\nThe great irony is that, had Cameron and Osborne gone in harder on Johnson and Gove's ridiculous claims in the referendum, Leave might not have gotten away with it. They might all still be running the Notting Hill chum-ocracy and gossiping at each other\u2019s dinner parties about the hopelessness of Theresa May. Instead, Cameron refused to engage in \u201cblue on blue\u201d combat and the nation was much the poorer for it \u2013 as well as leaving the old gang split asunder and all of them feeling a bit bereft.\n\nWhat a pity we've all been given parts as extras in their private psychodrama.", "description": "There have always been rivalries and enmities in politics.
