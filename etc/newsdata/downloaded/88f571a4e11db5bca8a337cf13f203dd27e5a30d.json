After Twitter was done dissing Soan Papdi as a Diwali sweet, it has now moved on to making fun of rangoli and what a struggle it can be to make one.\n\nBeing the person who actually makes rangoli every year - even after officially being certified as a non-creative, non-artistic person by my nursery teacher who gave me a C+ in art and craft - I feel these people. I mean, first, I am under the pressure of outdoing what I did last year, then I have to actually do it and then live in the constant fear that someone will step over or tumble on my finest piece of work.\n\nIt is just too much stress. Then there are those on the Internet who cannot get over the need for rangoli-making competitions in offices. Below are some of the finest memes and observations about rangoli, that people have come up with. Be it regarding how to create one or how not to destroy one.\n\nStory of every sibling in Diwali \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/p0NCX0tO83 \u2014 Stuti\ud83c\udf38 (@morphinediary) October 26, 2019\n\nDon't Miss 366 SHARES 666 SHARES\n\nEmployee- Diwali bonus, sweets, increment, Diwali leave?\n\nHR- Rangoli competition. \u2014 Tara Singh (@m_like_star) October 26, 2019\n\nI saw rangoli at office reception area and suddenly realized that we have HR department. #HappyDiwali \u2014 Tweet Potato (@newshungree) October 26, 2019\n\nTrying to avoid rangolis during Diwali be like. pic.twitter.com/l81GvAxbxs \u2014 \u0921\u0940.\u0915\u0947.
