So carbon uptake by photosynthesis was halved.\n\nThis state lasted tens of thousands of years before the algae spread again. But it took millions of years until the fauna and flora had recovered.\n\nIn most settings, sediment accumulates so slowly such a rapid event such as an asteroid impact is hard to resolve in the rock record.\n\nDr Henehan said: \u2018Because so much sediment was laid down there at once it meant we could extract enough fossils to analyse and we were able to capture the transition.\u2019\n\nThe asteroid created the Chicxulub crater that is buried underneath the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.\n\nIn 1991 it was dated to around the time of the death of the dinosaurs went extinct and a debate has raged ever since as to whether it caused their demise.\n\nCo-author Professor Daniela Schmidt, of Bristol University, said: \u2018Understanding the cause of this mass extinction, which was the end of so much iconic life on earth has been a goal for decades.\n\n\u2018This unique dataset provides evidence for ocean acidification, affecting organisms which build shells and skeletons, with knock-on effects up the rest of the food chain.\u2019", "description": "Scientists find disturbing evidence of the space rock impact's devastating effect on our planet.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91004648_1571668349.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
