They used to come up on a Sunday, take a look and never buy. Now, they buy straight away because the market is quite hot.\n\n\u201dThe secret is out.\u201d\n\nShe said some Melbourne buyers could purchase in the affordable regional city without a mortgage, as even though property prices were rising \u201cit\u2019s not like it is in Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane\u201d.\n\nThe latest CoreLogic data shows the Ballarat council area\u2019s median house price has risen 9.8 per cent annually and 24.8 per cent over the past three years to $387,000.\n\nThe local council also had a focus of preserving heritage homes, meaning the city offered plenty of period properties, and its shopping and food scene was on the rise.\n\nAnd Ms Browning said the city had even more upside to look forward to, with the $100 million GovHub precinct that will house more than 1000 state government employees to be completed next year, and thousands of new homes in the pipeline in western suburb Lucas.\n\nMORE: Albert Park \u2018Downside Up House\u2019 a work of art on the market\n\nBarwon Heads curved house brings \u2018wow factor\u2019 to market\n\nGrand Kyneton old bank for sale after restoration\n\nsamantha.landy@news.com.au", "description": "A regional Victorian property market has caught the attention of international and interstate buyers, with a dream home featuring an infinity pool resembling a waterfall notably making waves.", "authors": ["Samantha Landy"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/30110047/capi_d40c7703b211675d85c1948596adfa1a_be1ab4c209cfabede5ccd918fb0c4d65.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
