Reminder: There are 124 days until the Iowa caucuses and 398 days until the 2020 election.\n\nWith enemies like these, who needs friends?\n\nIn recent days, some of the most powerful business leaders in America have focused their ire on a single presidential candidate \u2014 Elizabeth Warren. There\u2019s only one problem: By speaking out against the Massachusetts senator, these titans of industry may actually wind up boosting her in the Democratic primary and, if she gets that far, the general election.\n\nThe trend started on Sept. 26 with a CNBC story in which several aggrieved \u201cWall Street Democratic donors\u201d warned that they were ready to \u201csit out, or back Trump, if [Democrats] nominate Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in a box because you\u2019re a Democrat and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018I want to help the party, but she\u2019s going to hurt me,\u2019\u201d one such donor told CNBC, alluding to Warren\u2019s many plans to curb Wall Street\u2019s influence, including a wealth tax. \u201c\u2018So I\u2019m going to help President Trump.\u2019\u201d\n\nThen on Tuesday, the Verge published leaked text and audio from a July internal meeting at Facebook at which CEO Mark Zuckerberg railed against Warren, vowing to \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to fend off her plan to break up big tech.\n\n\u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd does that still suck for us? Yeah ... but look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s response? Undisguised glee. \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck,\u2019\u201d she tweeted after the Zuckerberg recordings surfaced, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d\n\nThen she tweeted about her plan to #BreakUpBigTech eight more times over the next 24 hours.\n\nSame with the Wall Street dustup. \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message,\u201d she wrote on Twitter, retweeting a CNBC segment about the story.\n\nAnd that pretty much sums up the thinking in Warrenland: These disses from Zuckerberg and Wall Street so perfectly capture our candidate\u2019s anticorruption message, they might as well be campaign ads.\n\nSen.

Donald Trump won the 2016 election because he conveyed a kind of unorthodox populism that combined cultural appeals to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d with economic promises that resonated in the Rust Belt. But as president he has not delivered on the economic part of the bargain, choosing instead to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut that largely benefited rich people and corporations.\n\nWarren\u2019s whole pitch is that she is the sort of economic populist Trump only pretended to be. And like any populist, she tends to divide the world into Us (average Americans and their advocates, like Warren) and Them (corporate fat cats and those she sees as their enablers, like Trump).\n\nNow those fat cats are playing along \u2014 and they\u2019re unlikely to win the popularity contest. According to the Pew Research Center, the share of Americans who believe tech companies like Facebook have a positive impact has tumbled 21 percentage points over the past four years; at the same time, negative views of tech companies have nearly doubled. A September survey showed that nearly two-thirds of Americans would support breaking up big tech to ensure more competition \u2014 including 60 percent of Republicans. Meanwhile, about six in 10 Americans say they are bothered \u201ca lot\u201d by the feeling that some corporations (62 percent) and wealthy people (60 percent) do not pay their fair share in taxes, and most Americans (63 percent) say the economic system in the United States unfairly favors powerful interests.", "description": "In recent days, some of the most powerful business leaders in America have focused their ire on a single presidential candidate \u2014 Elizabeth Warren.", "authors": ["Andrew Romano", "West Coast Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TaG9X0cgFqUULVtBeNLJKw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/6e8fcfa0-e525-11e9-b67e-297e87bfbc73", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
