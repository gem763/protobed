Later stage companies have evidence of business progress so the management team, implementation, ability to scale are all considered. Whereas in seed and early stage companies, it's more the team than the idea. Often there is limited data or metrics to rely on, so you have to believe in the team and management.\n\nHow do you measure the value of a non-income producing growth company?\n\nRevenue is not the only metric to value a company. A dedicated user base or useful technology also make a business an appealing acquisition target. For example the $US19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp. The largest value add was its increasing market penetration, which as the user base grows the app becomes indispensable.\n\nDo you think we are in a fintech bubble?\n\nThere are plenty of stocks trading on hefty multiples.\n\nDo you think value investing will make a comeback?\n\nRegardless of the strategy, to ensure success, investing takes patience. Be prepared to hold on to it for 10 years.\n\nBest bit of advice you can give someone with $50,000 to invest?\n\nInvest in what you know and are confident in and be prepared to hold on to it for five to 10 years for significant gains. Invest in companies and products that you use every day.
