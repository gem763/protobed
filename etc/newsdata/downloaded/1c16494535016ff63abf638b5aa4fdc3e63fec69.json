And they did that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor Ankara, this is a rational decision. This may take Americans by surprise,\u201d but the final deal was always going to be made with the Russians, he said.\n\nAD", "description": "Esper and Iraqi officials appeared to disagree over whether U.S. troops departing Syria would be redeployed to western Iraq.", "authors": ["Erin Cunningham", "Middle East Reporter Covering Iran", "Turkey", "Syria", "The Wider Region", "Kareem Fahim", "Istanbul Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4ZJfCXO7VhXl-Bxn_rCiMU0rsBs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BDL4VFXVPEI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
