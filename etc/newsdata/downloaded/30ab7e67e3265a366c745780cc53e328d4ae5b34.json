But wealthy waterside suburbs along the harbor and coast have been existing in a different world.\n\n\n\nAccording to CoreLogic figures prepared for Mansion Global, the most prestigious waterside suburbs that front Sydney Harbour, Middle Harbour or the coastline have seen strong, sustained growth against a backdrop of stagnating or falling house prices across broader Sydney.\n\n\n\nNow with signs the Sydney market is beginning to come to life again, investors who buy a slice of Sydney\u2019s iconic shores could enjoy healthy capital growth.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question the popularity of waterfront-type situations is accelerating faster than overall value growth,\u201d said Brian White AO, joint chairman of Ray White Group, which has nearly 1,000 individual offices across Australasia and last year sold A$45 billion (US$30.46 million) worth of property.\n\n\n\n\u201cWaterfront and waterfront views are highly prized, and in the emerging recovery in the Australian market, we\u2019re expecting the popularity of waterfront to continue to escalate,\u201d he said.\n\nMore: Mounting Interest in Australia\u2019s Historic Town of Macedon\n\nThe sale of a sandstone cottage overlooking picturesque Palm Beach illustrates how active the market has been. Held by the same family for more than a century, the three-story home Seabellhas meandering gardens and sweeping views of the beach and ocean, with good potential for contemporary updates.\n\n\n\nAn exterior view of Seabell Ray White Prestige\n\nMarketed by Ray White Prestige (Palm Beach) broker Noel Nicholson, it went to auction on Aug. 29 and five registered participants bid it to its final price of A$7.67 million\u2014which was A$2 million above the seller\u2019s reserve, or agreed minimum selling price. More than 110 people attended the house\u2019s open-for-inspection events over the course of August.\n\n\n\nConsidering the continued sluggishness of Sydney\u2019s overall market, investors would be wise to look toward the waterfront as these areas buck the long-term trends.\n\nMore: The Allure of Owning an Australian Island\n\nNot Just a One-Off\n\n\n\nThe cottage transaction was an excellent result for the seller, and not an isolated event. The suburb of Palm Beach is booming. CoreLogic figures show the median house value rose 14.3% over the 12 months to July 19, taking it to A$2.47 million. This made it the Sydney waterside suburb with the greatest annual median price growth over the past year.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, Sydney home values fell annually by just under 7% according to the CoreLogic home value index for August.\n\n\n\nLocated on the tip of a peninsula on Sydney\u2019s northeastern fringe and surrounded by national parks, it has a popular surf beach along its eastern side and the calm waters of the Pittwater drowned valley estuary along its western side.\n\n\n\nRising median values, however, don\u2019t necessarily mean rising house values and could be due to a shift in the composition of sales toward more expensive homes. But it does suggest value growth is taking place, and at the very least means money is flowing into a suburb.\n\nMore: Australian Businessman John Symond Selling Yacht for \u20ac97.5 Million\n\nComing in second for annual median growth was Vaucluse in Sydney\u2019s prestigious eastern suburbs. Its median house value rose 13.3% to A$4.89 million over the same 12-month span\n\n\n\nVaucluse also sits on a peninsula and has several beaches, including Parsley Bay and the sublime but not-so-invitingly-named Shark Beach (the beach has a large shark net within which beachgoers can safely swim). There are rocky cliffs and the Lighthouse Reserve along its ocean-facing side, and elevated views over Sydney Harbour and the Sydney Central Business District from its west side.\n\n\n\nOther strong performers for median house price growth were the harbor-facing suburbs of Neutral Bay, where the median house value rose 10.5% to A$2.37 million, and Rose Bay,where the median house value rose 5.7% to A$3.91 million.\n\n\n\nIn the Middle Harbour region of Sydney\u2014a leafy estuary which branches off from the north of Sydney Harbour\u2014the suburbs of Cremorne and Seaforth were also strong performers. Median house values in Cremorne rose 6.4% to $2.64 million, while median house values in Seaforth rose 4% to $2.97 million.\n\nFrom Penta: Global UHNW Population Flatlines, Combined Wealth Declines for the First Time in Three Years\n\nApartments Also Strong\n\n\n\nThe research also looked at apartments in Sydney\u2019s waterside suburbs, which also saw impressive median price growth with a much lower entry price point more suited to investors.\n\n\n\nNewport, a little south of Palm Beach and also enjoying frontages to both the ocean and Pittwater, had median apartment price growth of 11.6% to A$930,000. Ocean-facing Warriewood, also part of Sydney\u2019s northern beaches area, had median apartment price growth of 2.5% to $965,000.\n\n\n\nApartments in the coastal suburbs of Mona Vale and Watsons Bay rose 1.8% to $1.01 million and 1.4% to $1.34 million respectively. Apartments in the Middle Harbour suburb of Northbridge rose 3.1% to A$895,000, and apartments in the Harbour-facing suburb of Woolloomooloo rose 5.3% to A$1.04 million.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that all of the above-mentioned suburbs also saw impressive median price growth over a five-year period, suggesting this is not some passing fad. Over five years, the median house price rose 24.8% in Palm Beach, 57.8% in Vaucluse, 45.8% in Cremorne, 40.4% in Seaforth, 44.9% in Neutral Bay and 64.6% in Rose Bay.\n\nThey\u2019re impressive numbers, and equally so for apartments. Over five years, the median apartment price rose 56.3% in Newport, 35.6% in Warriewood, 46.8% in Mona Vale, 55.4% in Warriewood, 32.3% in Northbridge, and 60.8% in Woolloomooloo.\n\n\n\nMore: Whisper Listings Can Mean Deals to Buyers, but Most Benefits Go to the Seller\n\nHigher Prices, More Growth\n\n\n\nThe figures are particularly interesting when compared to a separate CoreLogic dataset that singled out the Sydney waterside regions with the lowest median house and unit values. Over the year to July 19, 27 out of the 28 suburbs measured\u2014including Kurnell, North Narrabeen, Killarney Heights and Gladesville\u2014saw median prices fall over the year to July 19, in most cases by more than 6%.\n\n\n\nSo why is the market in the city\u2019s most prestigious waterside suburbs booming while sellers in waterside suburbs that are more affordable are having a harder time getting their asking price?\n\n\n\nCameron Kusher, head of research Australia for CoreLogic, attributes the surge in premium property values to the health of the stock market.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe people buying these properties are invested in areas other than just property,\u201d Mr. Kusher said. \u201cWhile the market was falling, the sharemarket was doing well, so it\u2019s not going to have the same impact on their wealth.\u201d\n\nMore: For a Safer Bet in a Tough Luxury Market, Consider the Penthouse\n\nShawn Thomas, residential director of the Sydney office of nationwide valuation firm Herron Todd White, said while statistics measure broad market sentiment, a lot comes down to the individual property in attracting the fevered buying seen at Seabell.\n\n\n\nBuyers of prestige homes usually expect recently renovated or modern property with high-end finishes. For apartments, large living areas and a lot of outdoor space are a must.\n\n\n\nFor properties near the water, views and water frontage are very popular features, especially if the property has access to the sea.\n\n\n\nWhite points out that long-standing properties like Seabell\u2014which was built more than a century ago\u2014were often built when the owners could choose the best position and aspect, and their great views are worth more than the mediocre ones offered by some other waterfront properties. If the property\u2019s prized view is in a position where it can never be compromised or blocked by another building, this is also a huge plus to a building\u2019s valuation.\n\nMore: Forget Perfectly Timing the Market and Focus on What You Can Do Instead\n\nHeld by the same family for more than a century, the three-story home Seabell has meandering gardens and sweeping views of the beach and ocean, with good potential for contemporary updates. Ray White Group\n\nAnd these things matter in a market where different buyer segments are behaving completely differently. Mr. Thomas attributes much of the Sydney housing market slowdown to tougher bank lending policies.\n\n\n\nHomes valued in the range of A$1.5 million to A$3 million were heavily hit by the recent downturn, Mr. Thomas said.\n\n\n\n\u201cObviously, as you start to get up to higher value properties, the buyers in that price range are less sensitive to borrowing restrictions,\u201d Mr. Thomas said..\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce you got above A$3 million and particularly getting up into A$5 million-plus, there was very little drop-off in some of those [wealthy] suburbs. As you can see, some suburbs like Vaucluse and places like Bellevue Hill and Mosman had increases over that time because the higher-end stuff is still selling.\u201d\n\nMore: Investors Can Still Capitalize as Demand Soars for \u2018Undervalued\u2019 Luxury Singapore Homes\n\nWhere Will It Go from Here?\n\n\n\nCoreLogic\u2019s Hedonic Home Value Index found Sydney home values rose 1.6% over the month of August and 1.9% in the three months to Aug. 31. The company said lower interest rates, stable federal government and a subtle easing in credit policy were driving a recovery in the Sydney market.\n\n\n\nSpring and summer are the traditional busy selling periods, and the coming months will demonstrate the strength of demand.\n\n\n\nPrestige waterfront properties have shown themselves to be insulated against factors that drive down the broader market, and have performed strongly right through the recent Sydney downturn. With demand potentially strengthening in the broader Sydney market, further capital growth in homes near the water looks likely.\n\n\n\nMore: The Price of Sights: How Much More You\u2019ll Get for Views of City Landmarks\n\nBut Kusher warns not to expect prices to skyrocket, at least in the next few years. Volatile share markets and geopolitical tension are bringing instability to the Australian economy, shaking the confidence of wealthy buyers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see massive falls, but also not much in the way of growth,\u201d Mr. Kusher said.\n\n\n\nAnd Mr. Thomas warns against thinking prestige properties never suffer during market downturns. The prestige end of the market was the hardest hit during the 2008 financial crisis. Stock market shocks and other hits to business conditions can have an outsized impact on expensive homes.\n\n\n\nMore: When Renovating to Sell, Focus on Kitchen Modernization, But Don\u2019t Go Overboard\n\n\u201cAfter the [global financial crisis], there were 30% and 40% declines in some of those prestige properties, but the general market came back [at a slower rate] at that time,\u201d Mr. Thomas said.\n\n\n\nLike Kusher, Mr. Thomas expects \u201cslight increases\u201d over the next 12 months, helped by predicted drops in interest rates. But global uncertainty could change this, he adds.\n\n\u201cThe concern at the top end is economic issues, the U.S. and China, anything that could impact world economies,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cThe stock market in Australia is volatile if things go wrong in the U.S., and that usually does correlate to price drops at the prestige end of town.\u201d\n\nClick for More In-Depth Analysis of Luxury Lifestyle News\ufeff\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Ben Hurley"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-111244?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
