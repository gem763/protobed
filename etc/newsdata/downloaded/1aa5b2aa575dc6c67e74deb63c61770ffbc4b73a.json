Several of the vehicles were flying large American flags, and were accompanied overhead by attack helicopters, eyewitnesses said.\n\nOne source in the border town of Qamishli said that a convoy of military vehicles with U.S. flags had passed through town, and exited southward toward Al Hasakah.\n\nA separate source in Hasakah said a convoy of U.S. military vehicles had entered that city from the north, and had exited that city on the south side, heading toward Deir ez-Zour.\n\nThe development comes two days after a senior defense official told NBC News that President Donald Trump was briefed by Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the importance of securing the oil fields so they can't be seized and used to fund ISIS' terrorist activities.\n\nThe senior defense official said Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, was working with a number of options, among them sending tanks to the region, deploying forces pulled from an armored brigade. An additional consideration was the possible use of air assets to support ground forces.\n\nTrump signaled the possible action in an address from the White House on Wednesday when he said, \"We're going to be protecting\" Syrian oil fields.\n\nKube is reporting from Erbil, Iraq.
