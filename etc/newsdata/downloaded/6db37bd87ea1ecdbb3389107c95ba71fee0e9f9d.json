I\u2019m a journalist and a writer, and my new book is called \u201cCollusion,\u201d and it\u2019s about Donald Trump and Russia.\n\nI know about Russian espionage, I suffer through it myself to some degree. I spent four years in Moscow as The Guardian\u2019s bureau chief and I had goons from the FSB \u2013 basically the KGB \u2013 breaking into my apartment, following me around the icy streets of Moscow, sometimes in quite a kind of comic sort of a way.\n\nYou don\u2019t really grow accustomed to FSB surveillance, but what we discovered, basically you didn\u2019t have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out that some strange people had been inside the flat because unlike in the movies, they left a series of blindingly obvious clues.\n\nAnd I took advice from the British Embassy in Moscow from diplomats from London and they said, \u201cTerribly sorry, old chap, but you\u2019re apartment is bugged.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, can you do something about it?\u201d And they said, \u201cNo, we can\u2019t,\u201d and I discovered that they had video as well, including in the bedroom.\n\nI think I understand kind of how these Russian intelligence people think. They are convinced that any American journalist, any British journalist, that we\u2019re all spies actually secretly working for the CIA or MI6 and that our goal is to undermine Russia by writing kind of propaganda.\n\nObviously, that\u2019s kind of crazy and wrong, but paradoxically that kind of gives us a degree of protection because there\u2019s one code for foreign spies, they can be harassed, they can be seduced, they can be exploited or surveilled, but ultimately you don\u2019t kill them. The people you kill are Russians who have betrayed the state and deserve the ultimate punishment.\n\nThe reason it\u2019s relevant is when you think about what happened in 2013 when Donald Trump famously visited the Ritz-Carlton Hotel for the Miss Universe beauty pageant. Did the Russians spy on him? Of course they did. It\u2019s what they do. For any kind of important guest, they would spy on him. So it\u2019s not really a question about whether they would have sought to kind of entrap him. It\u2019s a question of how he may or may not have behaved, and really only Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin know the answer to that.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This video was originally published on December 12, 2017.
