In the documentary, Heidi demonstrates the ability to solve puzzles, use tools and escape through small spaces. She also seems to behave like a family pet, as she learns to recognize faces, shows excitement when humans come near her tank and exhibits an inclination to play with Scheel\u2019s teenage daughter, Laurel.\n\nYou can check out the trailer here.", "description": "A marine biologist amusingly narrates this clip from PBS\u2019s \u201cOctopus: Making Contact,\" wondering what the animal is dreaming about.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a8e4424000032007d0d14.png?cache=abbfqohjsn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
