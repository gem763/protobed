An indictment will leave McCabe with no excuse for not carrying out his threat to bring them all down with him.\n\nBefore his firing, McCabe sent a shot across the bow of his co-conspirators in the plots to keep Hillary Clinton out of prison and Donald Trump out of the White House, according to Fox News correspondent Adam Housely in a series of tweets reported by Gateway Pundit at the time of the firing:\n\nFox News reporter Adam Housley reported on Twitter tonight about the firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, stating his sources were telling him that in the past few days McCabe threatened to \u201ctake people down with him\u201d if he was fired... 8:31 p.m. PDT: \u201cI am told yesterday McCabe felt the heat and went to try and save his last two days and even told some he would take people down with him if he was fired. So\u2026let\u2019s see what comes of this. I know this\u2026a ton of agents\u2026a ton\u2026were watching this very closely.\u201d\n\nInvestigative journalist Sara Carter confirmed McCabe\u2019s threat on the March 16, 2018 episode of \"The Ingraham Angle\":\n\nCARTER: He lied. Plain and simple he lied. A lot of former FBI agents that I spoke to say I hope he's fired. Is he going to get fired today? That's all I kept hearing all day because they realize if they had done this, they would have been fired too. And there's a lot of ongoing investigations right now. This is not just about Michael Horowitz at the DOJ right now. Remember, there's a prosecutor looking into the unmasking, the FISA abuse that has been taking place with Carter Page in particular. So, we have a number of investigations and McCabe is worried. He's said over and over again, if I go down, I'm taking everybody else with me.\n\nM cCabe was at the heart of all the criminal activity and knows where the bodies are buried. His silence until now may be traced to the fact that to date no one has actually been held accountable. An easy indictment of his boss, book tour veteran James Comey, was bypassed and newly minted CNN analyst McCabe, filling the chair vacated by creepy porn lawyer Michael Avenatti, got to join his fellow liar and leaker, John Brennan, at the poster child for fake news.\n\n\u201cLack of candor\u201d about leaking to the press is the least of McCabe\u2019s worries. McCabe is a signatory to at least one of the FISA applications requesting surveillance of American citizens, namely Team Trump. His signature was his affirmation that the information in it, based largely on the Steele dossier paid for by Team Hillary and the DNC and compiled from Russian sources by a British agent, was accurate and verified. The FISA warrant he signed was a fraud committed on the court.\n\nThe Steele dossier, despite McCabe\u2019s prior obfuscations, was acquired illegally. Money was laundered through a law firm to a dirt-gathering opposition research firm, Fusion GPS, to a foreign agent, Christopher Steele, to Russian sources making most of the stuff up. The fact that the transaction went through multiple hands does not make it any more legal. It just makes the coming indictment longer.\n\nMcCabe, the man he worked for, James Comey, and the people who worked under McCabe, such as Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, then took this fruit of foreign interference in our election and used it to commit a fraud upon the FISA court to trigger the illegal surveillance of one political campaign by another with the aid of co-conspirators at the DoJ and FBI.\n\nThat McCabe himself was a key architect of this coup is found in the texts of FBI Agent Peter Strozk, who speaks of the plan hatched in \u201cAndy\u2019s office\u201d to stop Trump at all costs, with this end justifying any and all means:\n\nOut of all the damning, politically charged anti-Trump text messages released, one text from Strzok to (Lisa) Page on August 15, 2016, raised the most suspicion. It referred to a conversation and a meeting that had just taken place in \"Andy's\" (widely believed to be Deputy FBI Dir. Andrew McCabe's) office. According to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), Strzok had texted this: \"I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office [break]... that there's no way he gets elected. I want to believe that... But I'm afraid we can't take that risk... We have to do something about it.\" In another text, Page said: \"maybe you\u2019re meant to stay where you are because you\u2019re meant to protect the country from that menace.\" Strzok replied: \"I can protect our country at many levels, not sure if that helps.\" \"This goes to intent,\" Jordan said. \"We can't take the risk that the people of this great country might elect Donald Trump. We can't take this risk. This is Peter Strzok, head of counterintelligence at the FBI. This is Peter Strzok, who I think had a hand in that dossier that was all dressed up and taken to the FISA court. He's saying, 'we can't take the risk, we have to do something about it.'\"\n\nMcCabe himself said under oath he could not verify the accuracy of virtually anything in the dossier and has acknowledged that without the \u201csalacious and unverified\u201d document, as James Comey once described it, no investigation of Team Trump would have occurred.\n\nThen there\u2019s the case of Michael Flynn. The unmasking of Flynn in the Russia probe may indeed be retaliation against Flynn for perceived political sins, but not for what and by whom you might think if reports from investigative watchdog site Circa News are correct.\n\nAs I noted here on June 30, 2017, Michael Flynn and Andrew McCabe have a past that predates the Trump presidency, one that provides ample motivation for the perjury trap that McCabe and Comey set up after Flynn\u2019s illegal unmasking. McCabe had a personal grudge against Flynn and the perjury trap was his revenge.\n\nIt explains why McCabe would entrap Flynn in a seemingly harmless interview about contacts with Flynn\u2019s Russian counterparts, advising Flynn he didn\u2019t need to bring a lawyer along to complicate things.\n\nAs Sara A. Carter and John Solomon of Circa News reported:\n\nThe FBI launched a criminal probe against former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn two years after the retired Army general roiled the bureau\u2019s leadership by intervening on behalf of a decorated counterterrorism agent who accused now-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and other top officials of sexual discrimination, according to documents and interviews. Flynn\u2019s intervention on behalf of Supervisory Special Agent Robyn Gritz was highly unusual, and included a letter in 2014 on his official Pentagon stationary, a public interview in 2015 supporting Gritz\u2019s case and an offer to testify on her behalf. His offer put him as a hostile witness in a case against McCabe, who was soaring through the bureau\u2019s leadership ranks. The FBI sought to block Flynn\u2019s support for the agent, asking a federal administrative law judge in May 2014 to keep Flynn and others from becoming a witness in her Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) case, memos obtained by Circa show. Two years later, the FBI opened its inquiry of Flynn\u2026 McCabe eventually became the bureau\u2019s No. 2 executive and emerged as a central player in the FBI\u2019s Russia election tampering investigation, putting him in a position to impact the criminal inquiry against Flynn. Three FBI employees told Circa they personally witnessed McCabe make disparaging remarks about Flynn before and during the time the retired Army general emerged as a figure in the Russia case.\n\nAndrew McCabe should not be a national pundit on CNN calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment. He should be preparing his legal defense against indictments that can\u2019t come a moment too soon. And we should be prepared for McCabe carrying out his threat to bring them all down. We may yet find out what really happened in \u201cAndy\u2019s office\u201d.\n\nDaniel John Sobieski is a freelance writer whose pieces have appeared in Investor\u2019s Business Daily, Human Events, Reason Magazine and the Chicago Sun-Times among other publications.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2019-09/216008.png"}
