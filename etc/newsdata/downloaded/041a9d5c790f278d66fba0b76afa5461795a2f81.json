Just about every man \u2014 regardless of the actual size of his penis \u2014 worries about being too small. Here\u2019s what you need to know about penis size, and what to do if you\u2019re afraid your penis is smaller than \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nThe Numbers\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk pure numbers. It\u2019s difficult to determine the true average penis size for a variety of reasons, including reporting bias and cross-cultural differences, but a recent comprehensive review found that the average is a little over 13cm when erect. 13.2cm, or 5.2 inches, to be exact. Most of my clients seem to think 16cm or even 18cm is average, but that just isn't the case.\n\nPenis Size Doesn\u2019t Affect Pleasure\n\nNow for the great news: The size of your penis also has absolutely no effect on the amount of pleasure that you\u2019re capable of feeling. Having a bigger penis doesn\u2019t equate feeling more pleasure during sex.\n\nDespite what the anxious thoughts in the back of your head might tell you, the size of your penis also has a surprisingly small effect on the amount of pleasure your partner is capable of feeling.\n\nIf you sleep with women, the size of your penis isn\u2019t as important as you think it is because penetration isn\u2019t the most pleasurable sexual activity for women.\n\nThe majority of nerve endings in a woman\u2019s genitals are focused in the clitoris. There are so few nerve endings in the vaginal canal that there isn\u2019t even a scientific tally of them. The nerve endings that the vagina does have are clustered towards the outer third of the vagina, meaning that deeper penetration doesn\u2019t create more pleasure.\n\nPenetration itself isn\u2019t the most pleasurable activity for women because it doesn\u2019t create very much clitoral stimulation. In fact, 70 to 80 per cent of women can\u2019t orgasm from penetration alone. Women can feel subtle differences between smaller and larger penises, but it\u2019s more a matter of fullness than of pleasure.\n\nA larger penis doesn\u2019t do any better of a job creating clitoral stimulation than a smaller penis does.\n\nHow Men Can Have An Ejaculation-Free Orgasm Men have long bemoaned the idea that women can have multiple orgasms, but men can't. Men, after all, have to deal with the frustrating refractory period - after an orgasm, their penises stay limp no matter how much they try to coax them into action. Their energy levels are depleted, anyway, and they often just want to sleep. Read more\n\nIf you sleep with men and are the penetrating partner with anal sex, a smaller penis is actually preferred. The rectum isn\u2019t capable of stretching in the same way a vagina is, so a smaller penis feels better than a larger one.\n\nSure, there are people who would prefer a larger-than-normal penis. But penis size isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for the overwhelming majority of people.\n\nIf you feel yourself worrying about the size of your penis, try imagining yourself on the opposite side of the equation. Would you dump your partner solely because of the size of her labia? Or her breasts? Or his penis? I doubt it.\n\nI\u2019m willing to bet that you see your partner as an entire human being, not a collection of body parts. Allow your partner to see you in the same way.\n\nSometimes It\u2019s About More Than Just Your Penis\n\nFor some men, penis-size anxiety is a symptom of an underlying anxiety problem. If you find yourself worrying about your penis size on a daily basis, or if the intensity of your anxiety seems excessive, you may want to focus on daily anxiety management.\n\nThe anxiety management recommendation that I most frequently give is to practise mindfulness. I like using the app Headspace because it actually teaches you how to be mindful. It uses a lot of very practical explanations that are easy to understand.\n\nHeadspace has an introductory series that you can try for free. If you like it, you can pay a small monthly fee for more series on different topics. In particular, you may want to check out their series about anxiety management. Many of my clients (especially male clients with performance issues) have found this series to be extremely helpful.\n\nIf watching porn triggers penis size anxiety, you may want to take a temporary (or permanent) hiatus from watching. It\u2019s easy to forget that porn is meant to be entertainment, and that porn actors are basically required to have large penises. If you see large penises on a daily basis, it\u2019s easy to develop a skewed view of what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve worked with a number of clients who torture themselves by doing internet research on penis size. That may even be how you found this article! This kind of research is of course not helpful, and tends to make anxiety much worse. You may want to add some sort of browser extension to your computer to prevent yourself from doing those kinds of searches. You can also block yourself from the penis size websites and forums you usually visit.\n\nHow to Work with Your Penis\n\nAs I mentioned above, your penis size doesn\u2019t play as big of a role in sexual pleasure as you may think it does.
