Surely, I assumed, world leaders wanted reassurance at every stop about the United States\u2019 direction from the woman who is third in line to the presidency. But Pelosi told me in an interview last week that she didn\u2019t engage.\n\n\u201cI make it a practice, I always have, of never criticizing the president of the United States when I\u2019m overseas,\u201d she explained, sitting in her sunlit office with a dead-center view of the National Mall. \u201cI save that for here.\u201d\n\nBoy, does she ever. Pelosi is well known for keeping her cards close. But over the course of a conversation last Wednesday, the speaker offered a glimpse into what she is thinking both by virtue of what she said and what she did not say.\n\nI started by asking her if the president could be trusted to make deals with Congress given how rarely he follows through on his commitments. After all, he once promised a \u201cbill of love\u201d in 2018 to address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. He said he wanted background checks for gun purchasers after the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., last year. He said it again in the wake of August\u2019s shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nHer answer to my question about trust was a master class in politics.\n\n\u201cWhether or not the president can be trusted . . . doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhat matters is what leverage we have to ensure that something is done, because every day that Senator [Mitch] McConnell holds our legislation hostage, which we passed in February, more people die. So this isn\u2019t about trusting a president. This is about public sentiment. The public sentiment, as Lincoln said, is everything. With it, you can accomplish almost anything. Without it, practically nothing. And public sentiment, 90 percent of the American people support common-sense background checks.\u201d\n\nBut, explained Pelosi, without the leverage that can force the Republicans to make a deal, public sentiment alone is not enough to get laws changed. \u201cWe don\u2019t get anything from them that we don\u2019t negotiate for or have leverage to get, because we don\u2019t really have shared values,\u201d she said. She defined those different values in a \u201cWhat is America\u201d riff that deftly sums up our broken politics.\n\n\u201cWhat is America? America\u2019s our Constitution, our separation of powers, our Bill of Rights, our liberties, our freedom of the press. They don\u2019t respect that,\u201d Pelosi said of President Trump and McConnell. \u201cWhat is America? America\u2019s this land from sea to shining sea, this beautiful place and beyond. And what did they do? Degrade it. They dishonored the Constitution. They degrade our land. They denigrate our people, who we are, a nation of immigrants, by and large. And they undermine our values.\u201d She concluded, \u201cSo this isn\u2019t about a shared-values situation. This is about using your leverage. Do they have something that we want, and do we have something that they want?\u201d\n\nI asked the speaker if she believes Trump is a racist implementing a white supremacist agenda. \u201cI don\u2019t want to characterize the president for what he is or isn\u2019t. I just want to defeat him in the election,\u201d Pelosi added. \u201cI just want to just make sure that we can reverse as soon as we possibly can some of the damage he\u2019s done to America, whether it\u2019s our values, our people, our environment or our Constitution.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering, if she feels so strongly about the danger Trump poses to the country, why doesn\u2019t she green-light impeachment?\n\nPelosi takes her job as a legislator seriously. She takes her responsibility as a constitutional officer seriously. Her reverence for her office and the Constitution is second only to her devotion to her Catholic faith. Whatever the public mood about impeachment, there is no doubt in my mind that she believes Trump deserves it. But as the master class came to a close, she made it clear she is biding her time. Just listen to her words: At a press conference Thursday, she said, \u201cImpeachment is a very divisive measure, but if we have to go there, we\u2019ll have to go there. But we can\u2019t go there unless we have the facts, and we will follow the facts, and we will follow the obstruction the president is making . . . and make our decision when we\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nWhich means: She won\u2019t make a move on impeachment until she has maximum leverage and public sentiment behind her. The new House inquiry is all about getting the former and enlarging the latter. Meantime, voters should not forget the one sure alternative: voting Trump out in 2020.", "description": "She\u2019s just biding her time.", "authors": ["Jonathan Capehart", "Opinion Writer Focusing On The Intersection Of Social", "Cultural Issues", "Opinion Writer", "September At Pm", "Jonathan Capehart Is A Member Of The Post Editorial Board", "Writes About Politics", "Social Issues", "Is Host Of The", "Cape Up"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Y4tfh9RT4bHbsluEX8bNby0X4Lg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ZNOWAGTHAI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
