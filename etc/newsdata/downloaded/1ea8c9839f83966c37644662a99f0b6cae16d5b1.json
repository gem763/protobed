That's not to say they can't be reversed but they're running counter to Australia's interests.\"\n\nLowy Institute Pacific Islands program director Jonathan Pryke said Mr Manetiva's comments cast doubt about whether the agreement would go ahead but nonetheless was a jolt for Australia about the need for vigilance to keep China's strategic interests in check.\n\nWhile low in probability, Mr Pryke said the potentially high cost to Australia was \"China will use this investment to set up a military presence in the Pacific and that would change how Australia looks at security in the region\".", "description": "Strategists warn plans by a Chinese company to lease an entire island could pave the way for Beijing to build a military base on Australia's doorstep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3343%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_170%2C$y_224/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f2370aee373d31124f1a4b84f8afc5061061aa3f", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
