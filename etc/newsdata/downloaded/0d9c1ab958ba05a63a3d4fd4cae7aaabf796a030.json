He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\nUnlike most of his rallies held in Republican strongholds, Trump selected a congressional district for Thursday night\u2019s event that he lost by 55 points in 2016 \u2014 and one that is represented by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), the outspoken Somali American and Muslim lawmaker whom Trump has repeatedly attacked, sometimes using falsehoods.\n\n\u201cIt seems provocative. He wants to provoke a clash so he can arouse his cult to a civil war,\u201d said Polly Kellogg, 76, a retired social justice professor who planned to protest the rally. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for violent videos.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s supporters say the president should be allowed to visit any city in the United States without facing opposition and blamed divisions in the country on liberals, not the president.\n\n\u201cI would feel better if you could go and attend and not have to worry about your own safety,\u201d said Trump supporter Dana Smith, 60, who lives in St. Paul, Minn., and whose husband planned to attend the rally.\n\nMary Jo Buffalo, 62, who lives in the Minneapolis exurbs, added: \u201cWho are the aggressors? Who is instigating all of this division? Seems like it\u2019s coming from the Democrats or the press.\u201d\n\nLong before the city installed a security perimeter around the downtown Target Center arena, the battle lines had been firmly drawn over his event \u2014 and Trump took every opportunity to inflame the tensions.\n\nAD\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, refused to welcome the president to the city because Trump \u201chas made it clear that he does not value the perspectives or rights of Minneapolis\u2019 diverse communities.\u201d Omar tweeted that while \u201cour beautiful state welcomes everyone with open arms . . . we will continue to reject you and your campaign of lies and bigotry.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump singled out Omar for criticism during the rally, telling the crowd that \u201cshe is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I am going to win and the Republican Party is going to win.\u201d\n\nOverhead, images of Omar flashed on the large TV screens hanging from the ceiling.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier in the evening, the president\u2019s son Eric Trump warmed up the crowd by taking aim at Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, leading the crowd in a chant of \u201cLock him up!\u201d\n\nThe phrase is a play on \u201cLock her up,\u201d a Trump rally favorite.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to lock him up,\u201d Eric Trump said of Hunter Biden. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to beat the hell out of him. We\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nRoughly two dozen groups led protests of Trump\u2019s rally, including those that advocate for the rights of immigrants, civil rights organizations, labor unions and a few self-described anti-fascist or anarchist groups. Although protesters in other cities have often gathered a mile or more away from Trump\u2019s rally venues, those in Minneapolis gathered right next to the arena.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeveral pro-Trump groups also said they planned to show up, including Bikers for Trump, the Minnesota-based Three Percenters militia and the Oath Keepers, an armed militia that opposes \u201cantifa\u201d activists.\n\nAs the Minneapolis police came up with a plan to keep peace and prevent violence, Bob Kroll of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis criticized a new city policy that forbids off-duty officers from wearing their uniforms to political events \u2014 and began to sell red \u201cCops for Trump\u201d T-shirts, an effort that Trump has repeatedly applauded.\n\n\u201cThere are already those in the city who have reason not to trust the police without having the head of the police union openly come out and endorse Trump and try to recruit as many officers as he can to show up at the rally wearing horrible red T-shirts,\u201d said Sarah Lechner, 69, a retired psychiatric nurse who is hosting a migrant family from Honduras in her Minneapolis home. \u201cThis is not going to help the city in any way \u2014 I\u2019m sure that just thrills Trump because he doesn\u2019t like large cities, which tend to be more egalitarian and Democratic-leaning.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis week, Trump and the Minneapolis mayor have continued to trade jabs on Twitter. The mayor had called on Trump\u2019s campaign to prepay the added security costs of the rally, which the campaign refused to do. On Wednesday, a small group of Trump\u2019s supporters gathered at city hall to chant: \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d\n\nElsewhere downtown, an \u00adLGBTQ nightclub was hoisting a massive inflatable \u201cBaby Trump,\u201d and another club pledged to donate all of its profits from Thursday night to Planned Parenthood.\n\nTrump came close to winning Minnesota in 2016, alarming Democrats who worry he could claim the state in 2020. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) \u2014 a presidential candidate who won 43 rural Minnesota counties in 2018 that voted for Trump in 2016 \u2014 mocked Trump for recently butchering the pronunciation of Minneapolis, writing in a Thursday tweet: \u201cPlease go back to \u2018Mar-a-Lago.\u2019 At least you can pronounce that. Just another reason I can take this guy in the midwest.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday morning, Trump\u2019s supporters were already lining up outside the Target Center, which can hold nearly 20,000 people. Those organizing protests hoped they would have just as many people outside, despite a rainy forecast.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, a small group of activists gathered around picnic tables at Minneapolis\u2019s Powderhorn Park to create protest signs for the rally. The surrounding neighborhood was filled with murals and sunflower patches and spotted with signs declaring \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d \u201cAll are welcome here\u201d and \u201cLove your neighbor.\u201d At the local coffee shop, May Day Cafe, a small sign near the cash register asked patrons to \u201cuse gender neutral language while addressing its employees.\u201d Across the street from the cafe, the window of an empty storefront was defaced with pink paint reading, \u201cLove not hate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLechner, the retired nurse, said that she worried the rally would lead to more violence against people of color in Minneapolis, and she accused Trump supporters of prioritizing small financial gains over the treatment of migrants and minorities.\n\n\u201cMy father was a refugee from Nazi Germany, and my grandparents died in the Holocaust, and to me it\u2019s just all too familiar,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve sort of become the ordinary Germans \u2014 if it\u2019s not directly impinging on us personally, we can tolerate it. We can forget.\u201d\n\nLater that evening in nearby St. Paul, a few hundred conservative women gathered in a ballroom for a \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d event that featured second lady Karen Pence, Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law Lara Trump and campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany. The three women focused heavily on the economy \u2014 there was only one murmured mention of impeachment \u2014 and repeatedly described Trump as a president who cares about women.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis president has empowered women like no other,\u201d Pence said. \u201cIf you just look at the jobs \u2014 just look at job rates \u2014 the unemployment for women is the lowest that it has been in 55 years.\u201d\n\nPence and the others described the president as being unfairly attacked for just doing the job he was elected to do, and they urged the women in the audience to defend him and encourage those they know to vote for him in 2020.\n\nLara Trump described the division playing out in the country as a sign of the president\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cYou know what, ladies? The swamp does not go down without a fight,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we know that this president is winning for this country.\u201d\n\nFelicia Sonmez in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "Unlike most of his events held in Republican strongholds, Trump selected a congressional district for Thursday night\u2019s rally that he lost by 55 points in 2016.", "authors": ["Jenna Johnson", "National Political Correspondent", "Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter", "Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=127", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
