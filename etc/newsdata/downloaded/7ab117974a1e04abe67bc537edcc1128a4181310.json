Always at odds!\n\nIf you read the headline and thought, \u201cI\u2019m sick to death of the entire cast of characters from 2016,\u201d bad news \u2014 we\u2019ll be relitigating the Election Of The Damned for the rest of our miserable lives. Night and day, on and on, for decades. It\u2019s even possible that Trump and Hillary will each live another 15 years and still be sniping at each other on Twitter or whatever hellish social-media nightmare ends up replacing that platform by 2034.\n\nGet comfortable, is what I\u2019m saying. This \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d marathon never ends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in favor of moving toward impeachment,\u201d [Clinton] said. \u201cI did not come to that decision easily or quickly, but this is an emergency as I see it. \u2026 This latest behavior around Ukraine, trying to enlist the president of Ukraine in a plot to undermine former Vice President Biden or lose the military aide he needs to defend against Trump\u2019s friend, Vladimir Putin \u2014 if that\u2019s not an impeachable offense, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\u2026 Calling Trump a \u201ccorrupt human tornado,\u201d Clinton told PEOPLE it is the constitutional duty of the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings \u201cnot happily or with glee,\u201d but in the interests of national security. \u201cThe president of the United States is betraying our country on a daily basis,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThis man who is in the Oval Office right now is a clear and present danger to the future of the United States.\u201d\n\nYou would think that the guy who may or may not have inadvertently cost her the presidency, who\u2019s spent nearly every waking hour of the past two years pressing the case that Trump is a human wrecking ball slamming against democratic norms, would join her in wanting him out of office ASAP. Not so. James Comey was asked about the new Democratic impeachment push today and reprised a line he\u2019s used before: American voters would be \u201clet off the hook\u201d if Congress intervened to cut short Trump\u2019s presidency. The only way to undo the mistake of 2016, Comey says, is to have the people who sent him to Washington now send him home.\n\nI\u2019ve never understood his \u201clet off the hook\u201d point. It\u2019s as if the American electorate is a naughty child that needs to sit in the corner and think about what it\u2019s done until it\u2019s ready to apologize. Why does he believe that a country capable of nominating and electing Trump in the first place will have some crisis of conscience about him in 2020? If Trump loses, it\u2019ll likely be due to a combination of fatigue and his Democratic opponent this time not being quite as personally obnoxious as his last Democratic opponent. Anyone who\u2019s casting a ballot against him on moral or ethical grounds likely already voted against him on those grounds three years ago: Say what you want about Trump, he is who voters thought he was. I don\u2019t know why Comey\u2019s giving the people who made him president the benefit of the doubt in implying that all of this is somehow surprising and disappointing to them.\n\nBeyond that, if you take his point seriously that only the electorate should properly undo the mistake of the electorate, it\u2019s a recipe for endless abuses of power by Trump. The president is a man who takes advantage of opportunities; Comey\u2019s essentially saying that Trump shouldn\u2019t be impeached no matter what corrupt opportunities he chooses to take advantage of. Imagine what that might look like in practice over the next 13 months. I get that his mien is \u201cdisappointed schoolteacher,\u201d but no matter how much he might prefer to scold voters until they see the errors of their ways, there has to be *some* form of misconduct hypothetically that would properly trigger impeachment in the House. Does this Ukraine thing rise to that level? If not, what does?\n\nHe can\u2019t really mean to imply that *nothing* would reach that level.\n\nHis point about Trumpers viewing impeachment as a \u201ccoup\u201d is sounder, and has been made elsewhere:\n\nA Russian opposition figure told me, before the Mueller report came out, that she hoped Trump wouldn\u2019t be impeached or indicted. I asked why. \u201cBecause his removal will not be seen as legitimate by half the country and America will be paralyzed.\u201d \u2014 Michael Weiss (@michaeldweiss) September 24, 2019\n\nThe wrinkle, though, is that much of the country is likely to view a repudiation next fall at the polls that way too. Not the same number as would view impeachment as illegitimate, of course: If Trump lost decisively at the ballot box, maybe 25 percent would treat the result as some sort of scam versus the 50 percent or so who\u2019d treat impeachment as a coup. But if the election is close, as it\u2019s apt to be? Imagine if Trump had lost Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida in 2016 by the same whisker-thin margins he ended up winning them by. It would be an article of faith among righties to this day, just as it\u2019s an article of faith for many lefties, that the vote was rigged somehow. Illegal aliens voted or the Clinton machine had the numbers manipulated or what have you. Trump himself would have egged on those beliefs every day on Twitter and Fox News. And that\u2019s what\u2019ll happen if he loses narrowly next year \u2014 in which case how different is impeachment really from losing an election in terms of legitimacy?\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, read this short but interesting thread from David Drucker about a conversation he had with \u201ca Republican who is measured & knowledgable.\u201d What if Trump *and* Biden each had innocent intentions in their interactions with Ukraine?", "description": "\"This is an emergency as I see it.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/c-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
