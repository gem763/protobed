Terrifying moment mechanic hauls a monster 15ft python out of a truck engine", "language": "en", "text": "A truck driver who thought the engine sounded strange when he started it up had a look under the bonnet \u2013 and found a monster fifteen-foot python staring straight back at him!\n\nThe shocked driver screamed for help and diesel mechanic Wynand Bloem, 31, rushed to his aid and found the giant reptile had coiled itself round the engine block and made itself at home.\n\nThe shocking incident happened on the ZZ2 Farm in Tzaneen, Limpopo Province, South Africa.\n\nThis is the moment diesel fitter Wynand Bloem removed a 15-foot python from a truck on the farm where he works in South Africa\n\nThe team proudly displayed the snake after rescuing it from the truck in South Africa\n\nWynand decided the wild python should be rescued safely and returned to the jungle and alive and along with his fellow workers spent four hours stripping out much of the lorry engine parts.\n\nWhen they had removed enough of the diesel power unit one of the workers at the tomato and avocado farm reached inside and bravely grabbed the python's massive head with both his hands.\n\nThis amazing video shows the workers and Wynand gently easing the python out of its hiding place foot-by-foot until eventually the whole snake is pulled free and laid out to its full length by the truck.\n\nZZ2 Farm marketing manager Clive Garrett, 57, said: 'The lorry driver had pulled up in the truck and the guys were loading it up with tomatoes when we think the snake slithered into the engine.\n\n'It was a very cold morning and the engine would have been nice and warm so we think it coiled itself up around the engine block and settled down to have a nice little sleep out of the chill.\n\n'When the lorry was loaded the driver started the engine but thought there was something wrong with the fan belt as it was making a funny noise and he took a little look under the bonnet.\n\n'He came immediately face to face with the head of the python and it is fair to say he gave a yelp and everyone went running and saw this huge snake had taken up residence under the bonnet.\n\n'We work at one with nature at the farm and we knew we had to get the python out unhurt and return it to the wild so we spent a couple of hours stripping the engine out so that we could get to it.\n\n'Then one of the workers volunteered to grab the python's head and the tug-of-war began but none of us expected it to be at long as it was and it just kept coming and coming and coming out.\n\n'Our diesel mechanic Wynand grew up on a farm and is used to snakes and he stretched it out and reckons it was about fifteen feet long and then he picked it up and put it over his shoulders.\n\n'It was a pretty interesting way to start the day and then when he and a few of the workers had their photographs taken with it the python it was released safely back into the forest' he said.\n\nZZ2 employs 10,000 people and is the biggest producer of tomatoes and avocados in South Africa.\n\nThe African Rock Python can grow to more than 6 metres long and weigh up to 200lbs and preys on antelope, goats, monkeys, crocodiles and has even been known to attack and kill humans.\n\nThey are non-venomous but coil their bodies coil round their prey and constricts them until dead and then they dislocate their own jaws so that they can swallow whatever they have killed whole.\n\nIt is Africa's largest snake and the fourth largest in the world by mass but rarely attacks humans and can live for up to 30 years in the wild and most of its victims die in terror from cardiac arrest.", "description": "Diesel fitter Wynand Bloem, 31, stripped part of this truck's engine after a python coiled itself around the block when it pulled up to collect fruit from the ZZ2 farm in Tzaneen, Limpopo Province, South Africa.", "authors": ["Jamie Pyatt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/09/19433718-0-image-a-12_1570524526672.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
