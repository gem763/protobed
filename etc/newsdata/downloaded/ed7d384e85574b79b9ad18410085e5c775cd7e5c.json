I try to copy.\n\n'It's not quite similar but I try my best. I am not around any distractions of living in Cardiff or Manchester with my friends.\n\n'It's nice to be around your friends but [living] alone I just do more for myself. That's improved me. I am doing little extras, going to the gym and eating good food.'\n\nMatondo admitted: ''I go on Gordon Ramsay a lot on YouTube and see what you can cook'\n\nMatondo, who has three caps for Wales, is attempting to emulate the success of fellow City youth product Jadon Sancho, now one of the most exciting players in the world since he joined Borussia Dortmund two years ago.\n\nSancho is close to establishing himself as an England regular and would command a huge transfer fee were he ever to leave.\n\nMatondo added: 'If I can do as well as he has done so far then I will be really happy. He is a great player.\n\n'I have always known that since being at Manchester City with him, how good he can be and how good he will be. Hopefully he can help me as well.'", "description": "The former Manchester City youngster, who is preparing for Wales' Euro 2020 qualifying double-header against Slovakia and Croatia, scored his first goal for Schalke last month.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19461446-0-image-a-54_1570567532763.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
