In all, seventy-six per cent of Britons do not trust Corbyn to do the right thing on Brexit.\n\nMr Johnson is currently in negotiations with the EU over a new exit deal which removes the Irish backstop. With 17 days to go until the scheduled exit date, if talks collapse, the prime minister has said he will take the UK out of the EU in a clean break.\n\nA plurality of those surveyed, 41 per cent, has said that leaving without a deal on October 31st is the best outcome if negotiations fail. This is compared to 33 per cent who still wish to stay in the EU and just 14 per cent who hope negotiations would continue until other exit arrangements are agreed.\n\nThe findings are similar to a ComRes poll from October 8th, when 42 per cent of those asked preferred a no-deal if the EU rejected Mr Johnson\u2019s offer, while 40 per cent disagreed.\n\nPoll: Majority of Britons Believe Society Is \u2018Broken\u2019, Economy \u2018Rigged\u2019 to Benefit \u2018Rich and Powerful\u2019 https://t.co/RB3SNs6x83 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 13, 2019\n\nPrime Minister Johnson has pledged to take the UK out of the EU on October 31st \u201cdo or die\u201d, with or without a deal.
