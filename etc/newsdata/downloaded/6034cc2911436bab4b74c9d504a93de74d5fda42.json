Classes are either live for from an on demand library. Classes are either gym based or outside ride recorded using cameras. Sensors record performance and show live on screen stats and leaderboards with others in the class.\n\nThis incredible change is down to one thing - Peloton.\n\nRather than going to classes in Manhattan, surrounded by the kind of terrifying people who go to spin classes in Manhattan, Peloton lets you take classes whenever you want - at home.\n\nIt\u2019s a spin bike with a built 22inch tablet screen built in.\n\nIt lets you stream rides live from the firm\u2019s New York HQ, but also access a vast library of on demand rides.\n\nMore than this, is also tracks your every move, letting you see exactly how much you\u2019re pedalling, what power you\u2019re putting out, and how you\u2019re doing in an online leaderboard which is either live or made up of other users who have taken the same on demand ride.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a cheap bike, costing $1995, with a $39 monthly subscription, and I've been using it for the last month.\n\nOne of the most interesting things about Peloton is the breadth of classes available.\n\nIt\u2019s astonishing, with everything from the standard dance music you\u2019d expect to 'boomer rides' consisting of only Peter Gabriel tracks, to country and western, heavy metal and classical rides.\n\nThere are also a few scenic rides you can take at your own pace and show video of national parks, along with a series of general exercise classes you can watch dealing stretching and warmups.\n\nIn addition, there are also live DJ rides, which are at first a little odd, with a DJ booth set up next to the instructor.\n\nHowever, these do really add to the atmosphere of rides, and became firm favourites with me.\n\nThere\u2019s also a big range of instructors, of all age ranges, something that really does help Peloton appeal to everyone - and there are even rides hosted by professional cyclists (which are as absurdly tough as you'd expect).\n\nOnce you\u2019ve started a class, you\u2019ll see live stats in front of you on a dashboard, and the instructors will often tell you exactly what these should be.\n\nUnlike a normal spin bike, Peloton\u2019s has a digital resistance control - so there\u2019s no more cheating by not turning it up when you\u2019re told.\n\nAfter each ride, you can see your stats - and how you've (hopefully) improved over time.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange experience at first - but breathtaking how quickly you forget where you are, and become immersed in the ride.\n\nIt really is like being in the studio, and in many ways better than most spin studios, as you\u2019re seeing so much data about your ride (and if you don\u2019t want to, any or all of it can be hidden with a tap).\n\nIf you have friends with bikes, you can even see them live on screen, and compete with them during classes.\n\nThe key to Peloton is its sense of community - after a few weeks, I developed my favourite instructors and rides (for the record, the 45 minute live DJ rides with DJ John Michael Di Spirito and Nicole Meline became my go to).\n\nOne of the most interesting things about Peloton is the breadth of classes available. It\u2019s astonishing, with everything from the standard dance music you\u2019d expect to 'boomer rides' consisting of only Peter Gabriel tracks, to country and western, heavy metal and classical rides.\n\nThe bike really does turn fitness into a game - there are badges available for rides, with everything from a new high output to a fastest speed.\n\nThe bike also tracks and stores every ride you do, and this is an incredibly addictive tool - and I found after a month, my numbers were significantly improved.\n\nOverall, the Peloton experience really is a perfect example of how technology can be used to change people\u2019s lives.\n\nClick below to watch a live ride in action\n\nFounder John Foley told me he set the firm up after realising he didn't have time to go to the gym.\n\n'My wife and I have 2 kids, we loved the gym, and missed going - it became harder and harder to make it there.'\n\n'We built a platform to allow people to take that class at home.'\n\nIt is, however, expensive.\n\nBut with the average spin class, in Manhattan at least, costing around $35 a week, and gym memberships running to hundreds of dollars a month, it\u2019s an investment that does pay for itself relatively quickly, at least if you use it regularly.\n\nAnd I found I did - I'll be honest, I assumed after a few weeks the bike would be doing double duty as a clothes horse in my spare room.\n\nIn fact. I'm was getting up early to sneak in 30 minute classes before work, something I never thought I\u2019d be doing.\n\nThe sheer convenience is the key, and the entire experience really has had an impact on my health in a way I didn\u2019t expect.\n\nIt's an awful lot of money for a spin bike - but for many people, it really could change you life for the better.", "description": "Peloton's hi-tech $2,000 lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home.
