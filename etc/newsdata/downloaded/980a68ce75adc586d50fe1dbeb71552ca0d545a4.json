City, who beat Aston Villa on Saturday, have 22 points.\n\nTottenham, in 11th place after a fourth defeat of the season, find themselves in the bottom half of the table heading into November for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nThe only bright note was Kane\u2019s opportunist effort which took him to equal third with Martin Chivers on Tottenham\u2019s all-time scoring list on 174 goals.\n\nVAR reared its head again elsewhere on Sunday.\n\nManchester United were awarded two penalties in the opening half against Norwich, the first after referee Stuart Attwell appeared rightly to not give a spot-kick when United\u2019s Daniel James and Ben Godfrey tangled.\n\nUnited were awarded another penalty via VAR for a Todd Cantwell handball. Both were saved by Tim Krul, the first from Marcus Rashford and the second from Anthony Martial.\n\nNO CONSEQUENCE\n\nFirst-half goals by Scott McTominay and Rashford and one from Martial after the break ensured the misses did not matter too much.\n\n\u201cVAR is there to help but when it takes ages like the first penalty, it is not a clear and obvious error,\u201d United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, whose side climbed to to seventh, said. \u201cWhen it took that long, it is a signal that it should not have been.\u201d\n\nArsenal were 2-0 up at home to Palace inside nine minutes with goals from Sokratis Papastathopoulos and David Luiz.\n\nPalace halved the deficit when Luka Milivojevic scored from the spot following a VAR intervention after referee Martin Atkinson had initially booked Wilfried Zaha for diving.\n\nJordan Ayew headed Palace level in the 52nd minute but VAR was again in action when Sokratis thought he had won it for the hosts in the dying minutes but his effort was ruled out for a foul by Callum Chambers on Gary Cahill.\n\nIt left Arsenal four points behind fourth-placed Chelsea who won at Burnley on Saturday. Palace are sixth.\n\n\u201cFor me there is no confusion \u2014 it is not a good decision,\u201d Arsenal manager Unai Emery said.\n\n\u201cWe deserved to win, we had a good reaction after they equalised, we scored but then they didn\u2019t count it.\u201d\n\nJonny rescued a point for Wolves after Jamaal Lascelles had given Newcastle the lead. The hosts ended with 10 men after Sean Longstaff was sent off.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Liverpool\u2019s Anfield fortress was briefly shaken by Tottenham Hotspur but Juergen Klopp\u2019s side recovered to secure a 2-1 win and restore their six-point lead atop the Premier League", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sala.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
