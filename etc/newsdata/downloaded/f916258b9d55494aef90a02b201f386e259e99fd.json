In other sites tombs that were reduced to mounds of bricks lay scattered in cleared tracts of land.\n\nWhile the official explanation ranges from urban development to the \u201cstandardisation\u201d of old graves, overseas Uighurs say the destruction is part of a state crackdown to control every element of their lives.\n\n\u201cThis is all part of China\u2019s campaign to effectively eradicate any evidence of who we are, to effectively make us like the Han Chinese,\u201d said Salih Hudayar, who said the graveyard where his great-grandparents were buried was demolished.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re destroying all of these historical sites, these cemeteries, to disconnect us from our history, from our fathers and our ancestors,\u201d he said.\n\nAn estimated one million mostly Muslim ethnic minorities have been rounded up into re-education camps in Xinjiang in the name of combatting religious extremism and separatism.\n\nThose who are free are subject to rigorous surveillance and restrictions \u2014 from home visits from officials to bans on beards and veils.\n\nChina has remained defiant despite escalating global criticism of its treatment of Uighurs. This week, the United States said it would curb visas for officials over the alleged abuses and blacklisted 28 Chinese firms it accuses of rights violations.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Religious persecution\u2019 \u2013\n\nAccording to satellite imagery analysed by AFP and Earthrise Alliance, the Chinese government has, since 2014, exhumed and flattened at least 45 Uighur cemeteries \u2014 including 30 in the past two years.\n\nThe Xinjiang government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe destruction is \u201cnot just about religious persecution,\u201d said Nurgul Sawut, who has five generations of family buried in Yengisar, southwestern Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cIt is much deeper than that,\u201d said Sawut, who now lives in Australia and last visited Xinjiang in 2016 to attend her father\u2019s funeral.\n\n\u201cIf you destroy that cemetery \u2026 you\u2019re uprooting whoever\u2019s on that land, whoever\u2019s connected to that land,\u201d she explained.\n\nEven sites featuring shrines or the tombs of famous individuals were not spared.\n\nIn Aksu, local authorities turned an enormous graveyard where prominent Uighur poet Lutpulla Mutellip was buried into \u201cHappiness Park,\u201d with fake pandas, a children\u2019s ride, and a man-made lake.\n\nMutellip\u2019s grave was like \u201ca modern day shrine for most nationalist Uighurs, patriotic Uighurs,\u201d recalled Ilshat Kokbore, who visited the tomb in the early 90s and now resides in the US.\n\nThe \u201cHappiness Park\u201d project saw graves moved to a new cemetery in an industrial zone out in the desert. The caretaker there said he had no knowledge of the fate of Mutellip\u2019s remains.\n\nThe Aksu government could not be reached for comment.\n\n\u2013 Destroying history \u2013\n\nIn China, urban growth and economic development has laid waste to innumerable cultural and historic sites, from traditional hutong neighbourhoods in Beijing to segments of Dali\u2019s ancient city wall in southwestern Yunnan province. It is an issue Beijing itself has acknowledged.\n\nThe government has also been criticised for its irreverence towards burial traditions outside of Xinjiang, including the destruction of coffins in central Jiangxi last year to force locals to cremate.\n\nBut activists and scholars say the clearances are especially egregious in Xinjiang, where they parallel the erasure of other cultural and spiritual sites \u2014 including at least 30 mosques and religious sites since 2017, an AFP investigation found in June.\n\n\u201cThe destruction of the graveyards is very much part of the wider raft of policies that are going on,\u201d said Rachel Harris, who researches Uighur culture at the School of Oriental and African Studies University of London.\n\n\u201cFrom the destruction of holy shrines, the tombs of saints, to the destruction of tombs of families, all of this is disrupting the relationship between people and their history, and the relationship between the people and the land that they live on,\u201d she said.\n\nThe official explanation for cemetery removal or relocation varies by site.\n\nIn Urumqi, the regional capital, a cemetery near the international airport was cleared to make way for an urban \u201creconstruction\u201d project.\n\nIn Shayar, where the local government has built new cemeteries near some of the old sites, an official told AFP the programme was aimed at \u201cstandardisation.\u201d\n\nA sign by a new cemetery in Shayar, which replaced a graveyard from the 18th century containing about 7,500 graves, echoed this statement.\n\nThe rebuilt sites \u201csaved space, protected the ecosystem\u201d and were \u201ccivilised\u201d, it said.\n\n\u201cThe new cemeteries are standardised, clean, and they\u2019re convenient for residents,\u201d Kadier Kasimu, deputy director of Shayar\u2019s cultural affairs bureau, told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Human remains \u2013\n\nTamar Mayer, a professor of geosciences at Middlebury College, who researches Uighur shrines and cemeteries, described the new sites as homogenous and tightly packed.\n\nFamilies, which traditionally leave gifts by the graves, no longer have \u201cspace to mourn\u201d, she said, adding the policy seemed to be an attempt to \u201csanitise the area from Uighurs\u201d.\n\nAziz Isa Elkun, a Uighur activist in Britain whose father was buried in one of the many destroyed cemeteries in Shayar, agreed: \u201cIf you want to build new graves then you can, but you do not need to destroy the old ones.\u201d\n\nThe Shayar government did not respond to AFP\u2019s questions on the process of moving remains to new sites.\n\nBut it is clear that human remains have been left behind in the process.\n\nOn a trip to Xinjiang in September, AFP visited 13 destroyed cemeteries across four cities and saw bones in at least three Shayar sites.\n\nLocal officials dismissed the evidence \u2013- one even picked up a bone, held it next to his right shin, and declared it \u201ctoo big to be a human\u2019s\u201d.\n\nBut seven forensic anthropologists who saw images taken by AFP identified a number of human remains, including a femur, feet, hand bones, and part of an elbow.\n\n\u201cThere are a range of ages,\u201d said Xanthe Mallett, a criminologist at the University of Newcastle.\n\nIn Hotan, southern Xinjiang, residents were given just two days to claim their dead, according to a government notice photographed by AFP in May.\n\n\u201cAny tombstone that was not claimed during the registration period will be relocated as an unclaimed corpse,\u201d it read in Uighur.\n\n\u201cThe owner of the tombstone is solely responsible for any consequences coming out of the failure in registration.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Attacks on Uighur culture \u2013\n\nThe move to raze Uighur cemeteries is not new \u2013- satellite imagery reviewed by AFP shows destruction from more than a decade ago.\n\nBut while Uighurs and ethnic minorities are still exempt from certain policies like cremation, which goes against Islamic tradition, authorities appear to be hardening their stance, said Rian Thum, a Uighur history and culture expert at the University of Nottingham.\n\nThey used to have a \u201cnon-confrontational approach to Uighur culture, but now any policy that attacks Uighur culture seems to get a boost rather than put in check as their approach has changed,\u201d said Thum.\n\nThe security crackdown in Xinjiang has also made it easier for authorities to ram through policies, said Tahir Hamut, a Uighur poet in the US who left Xinjiang in 2017.\n\n\u201cNo one dares to speak up now,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cNo one raises demands with the government.\u201d", "description": "Shayar (China) (AFP) \u2013 China is destroying burial grounds where generations of Uighur
