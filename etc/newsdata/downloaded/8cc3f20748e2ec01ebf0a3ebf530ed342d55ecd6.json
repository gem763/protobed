Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBencic got off to a bright start on a rainy day in New York, breaking the world number one under the closed roof of Arthur Ashe Stadium, and her superior serving carried the day as she won 82% of her first serve points.\n\nMomentum swung firmly in the 22-year-old Bencic\u2019s direction in the second set when Osaka double faulted to hand the 13th seed a 3-2 lead and the top-seeded Japanese, who appeared to struggle with a troublesome left knee, was unable to recover.\n\nBencic improved to 3-0 this year against the 21-year-old Osaka, who came through an emotional straight sets win over 15-year-old American Coco Gauff in the third round on Saturday.\n\nOsaka\u2019s defeat means Australia\u2019s Ash Barty, who lost in straight sets to China\u2019s Wang Qiang in the fourth round on Sunday, will regain the world number one spot from the Japanese.\n\nOsaka said that although she was disappointed with Monday\u2019s result she still considered her trip to New York a success.\n\n\u201cRight now I have this feeling of sadness, but I also feel like I have learned so much during this tournament,\u201d she told reporters.\n\n\u201cThe steps that I have taken as a person have been much greater than I would imagine at this point.\n\n\u201cSo I hope that I can keep growing. I know that if I keep working hard, then of course I\u2019ll have better results.\u201d\n\nBIG CHALLENGE\n\nBencic, who also reached the U.S. Open quarter-finals in 2014 when she was just 17 but has struggled with injuries in recent years, said that taking Osaka\u2019s powerful serve early and keeping her energy up was the key to winning the match.\n\n\u201cI was so excited to come on the court, the challenge could not be bigger so I had to be on top of my game,\u201d she said in an on-court interview.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really pleased with how I played and how I managed my nerves in the end,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the person with the most winners or aces, I had to play it a bit like chess with tactics on the court.\u201d\n\nDespite the lack of a big serve, Bencic played fluently, finishing with 29 winners to just 12 unforced errors and breaking Osaka three times.\n\nOsaka\u2019s loss comes the day after top seed Novak Djokovic fell to another Swiss, Stan Wawrinka.\n\nNext up for Bencic is a meeting with Croatia\u2019s 23rd seed Donna Vekic, who beat Germany\u2019s Julia Goerges 6-7(5) 7-5 6-3 on Louis Armstrong Stadium court earlier on Monday.", "description": "Naomi Osaka was upset 7-5 6-4 by Belinda Bencic at the U.S. Open on Monday as the Japanese lost her grip on both her title and number one status while the Swiss reached the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows for the second time.", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425501791&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811I6-OCASP"}
