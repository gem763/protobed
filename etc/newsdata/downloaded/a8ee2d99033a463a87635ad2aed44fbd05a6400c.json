The Associated Press is not naming the seven-year-old to protect the child\u2019s privacy.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott tweeted this week that the attorney general\u2019s office and Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (FPS) were looking into \u201cthe matter\u201d.\n\nAttorney General Ken Paxton said he was asking FPS to investigate the mother for possible child abuse, citing \u201cpublic reports\u201d in a letter that alleged she was \u201cforcing\u201d the child to transition to a girl.\n\nHowever, a judge said in a Thursday hearing in Dallas that the court noted no abuse, neglect or family violence in the case. Judge Kim Cooks ruled that the parents would make joint decisions about the child.\n\nCooks scolded the father, who she noted was unemployed, for seeking publicity and raising money on his website. But she also pointed out how the mother testified that her encouragement of the child being transgender may have been excessive.\n\n\u201cThe father finds comfort in public controversy and attention surrounded by his use of unfounded facts and is thus motivated by financial gain,\u201d Cooks said, adding that the gain came \u201cat the cost of the protection and privacy of his children\u201d.\n\nMuch of the public reaction to the case has focused on the narrative laid out on the father\u2019s website, which features a headline saying he\u2019s fighting \u201cchemical castration and sex-change of his son\u201d.\n\nA post of a woman holding a baby shared widely on Facebook targets the mother, saying she \u201calways wanted a girl\u201d.\n\nCooks said no Texas court or judge has ordered \u201cthe chemical castration, puberty blockers, hormone blockers or any transgender reassignment surgery on this child to become a female\u201d.\n\nAttorneys for Georgulas, who is a pediatrician, said before the hearing she was \u201cbeing viciously attacked and threatened by complete strangers based on false and untrue statements\u201d. Cooks said she limited spectators to only the media at the hearing because of safety concerns.\n\nEarlier this month, Georgulas filed a proposed parenting plan that said the child is not yet at an age where treatment with hormonal suppression, puberty blockers or gender reassignment surgery is considered. And she asked the court to not allow any such treatment without the consent of both parents.\n\nCooks said the court found that both parents love their children, and noted the seven year old appears comfortable as a male or female.\n\nYounger told the AP the child identifies as a boy when at his house. Asked after the hearing if he was happy, he only smiled and nodded.", "description": "Judge dismisses father\u2019s claim to be fighting \u2018chemical castration\u2019 of seven-year-old but attorney general wants investigation", "authors": ["Associated Press In Dallas"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39de406c9bcdfd465a76ff377d59dd15e863548/772_97_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=38cad3a51065a39007e06f25ab6d1603", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
