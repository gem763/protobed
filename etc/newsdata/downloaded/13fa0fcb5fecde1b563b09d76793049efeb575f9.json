An Indian folk game, created to teach about the ups and downs of karma, morphed into Chutes & Ladders. In the 19th century Checkered Game of Life, virtues and vices like honesty and idleness became spaces on the board that could send you forward or backward on the path that eventually became The Game of Life.\n\nToday there are so-called empathy games, a subgenre designed to broaden players\u2019 imaginative and interpersonal horizons, such as 2013\u2019s popular video game Papers, Please, which asks you to play as a 1980s Eastern Bloc border control officer. Putting yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes is an increasingly popular \u2014 albeit contested \u2014 goal of virtual reality. And designers continue to make board games with a political bent, exploring issues ranging from anti-colonialism to India\u2019s elections.\n\nSome games that attempt to impart the experience of another person succeed, and make us more complex and open in the process \u2014 like The Grizzled, a cooperative game about surviving the trenches of World War I. Others fail by pandering to their audience, inspiring smug satisfaction at engaging with \u201cvaluable\u201d culture. In almost all cases, these games will ask you to play as someone of a different demographic from yourself.\n\nTake 1971\u2019s Woman & Man: The Classic Confrontation, where players could choose to be a female or a male character, each with a specific professional objective \u2014 a woman might, for example, try to get promoted from kindergarten teacher to school superintendent. Players can also choose whether or not to play as women in Ms. Monopoly, a new variant on the world\u2019s best-known board game, released last month. Ostensibly, Ms. Monopoly is meant to depict the inequality women face in society, but every player has the same objective: to make the most money.", "description": "Games like this one attempt to have players reckon with social inequalities.
