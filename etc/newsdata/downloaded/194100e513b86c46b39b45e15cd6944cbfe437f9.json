She said many new applicants had very similar models to the banks they wanted to compete against.\n\nAPRA would ensure new players have high governance standards and monitored risks around the outsourcing of IT and using cloud computing platforms.\n\nAPRA's willingness to back new players able to manage banking risk comes as the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, seeks a government referral to continue to investigate competition - which he says is lacking - and after Treasurer Josh Frydenberg called on customers to shop around for better deals after the major banks failed to pass through Reserve Bank interest rate cuts in full last week.\n\nChief executive of Up, Dominic Pym. Supplied.\n\nYet it appears customers are starting to vote with their feet. Dominic Pym, co-founder of Up, told the same event it is adding new customers at the rate of 1,000 a day. It has 130,000 customers, quadruple management's targets after a year of operation. Key to its strategy is a more sophisticated approach to data analytics, including a partnership with Afterpay which is helping retailers understand the nature of their sales.\n\nMr Pym said Up's goal is to become the fifth-largest bank by customer numbers in three to five years, and it has a two year target for 2 million customers under the age of 35, which would be more than Commonwealth Bank. He said Up is building trust with younger customers by responding to them quickly, providing transparency around product development and creating a community around its brand. \"Our thinking is we don't sell financial services, we sell engagement,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUp is being modeled on Monzo in the UK; its co-founder Simon Vans-Colina said it is currently growing customers at the rate of 250,000 a month.\n\nMs Waterford said Up's partnership with Bendigo \"seems to be working\" and its growth is being monitored as part of APRA's supervision of Bendigo. But she cautioned others against thinking partnerships with incumbents would automatically succeed.\n\n\"We believe that taking deposits is a weighty responsibility, and we are unapologetic about setting high standards for people who wish to do so,\" she said. \"We don\u2019t want to create an uneven playing field between new entrants and existing ADIs.\"\n\nDespite APRA's focus on reducing risks, Ms Waterford said \"it is inevitable that some challenger banks will not survive\". This would not be due to management failing to run a new bank prudently, \"but because their innovative ideas did not attract enough customers to be sufficiently profitable, or enough investors to fund their capital needs.\"\n\nAsked how APRA would approach an existing bank wanting to build a new \"neobank\" brand, she said \"there are some challenges, as we haven't traditionally let banks own banks - so we would be looking at how the shareholdings would evolve over time.\"", "description": "The prudential regulator says neobanks will be held to the same standards as incumbents, and capital levels are the \"elephant in the room\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/081d20ff56788c2f4b5c9d3c3a4b639693765817", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
