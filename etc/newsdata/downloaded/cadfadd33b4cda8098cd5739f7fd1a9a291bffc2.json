In addition to touting his powerful perch in the Senate and the good it does for his home state of Kentucky, the majority leader and his very online advisers are also attempting to cement his unlikely status as a right-wing internet folk hero. Rubbing the Garland failure in the faces of liberals is just part of it.\n\n\u201cIf you spend more than two seconds online you will encounter some left-wing troll invoking Merrick Garland as justification for all brands of hate towards McConnell,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a longtime former aide to McConnell. \u201cHe knows this is a partisan viewpoint, and frankly it doesn\u2019t bother him, so he chooses to have a sense of humor about it rather than wring his hands and be a scold like so many in politics.\u201d\n\nA buttoned-up 77-year-old Kentuckian might not seem like the ideal template for the role of King of the Internet Troll. But that\u2019s the role he is quickly beginning to master. McConnell\u2019s path toward social media stardom kicked into high gear in 2018. That year, disgraced West Virginia coal baron Don Blankenship, then running in the state\u2019s GOP primary for U.S. Senate, cited the discovery years ago of cocaine packages on a ship owned by the father of Elaine Chao, McConnell\u2019s wife, to dub McConnell \u201cCocaine Mitch.\u201d\n\nMcConnell found the nickname hilarious, according to Holmes, and wanted to embrace it as his online \u201calter ego.\u201d When Blankenship lost the primary, McConnell\u2019s team tweeted an edited promotional picture from Narcos, the Netflix show about drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. In the tweet, McConnell was superimposed over Escobar and surrounded by plumes of cocaine.\n\nIn some conservative internet circles, McConnell GIF\u2019s have become common additions to tweets and posts. Images of the majority leader smirking have become synonymous with \u201cowning the libs.\u201d And McConnell, in turn, has embraced the idea that his most significant achievements, like blocking Garland and pushing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination through the Senate, continue to gin up outrage on the left.\n\n\u201cA lot of those brand pieces for McConnell came from attacks his team flipped into positive attributes, and it works that they have a member who relishes in being the strongman when it comes to Senate accomplishments,\u201d said a Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about McConnell\u2019s strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years, he\u2019s been the left\u2019s foil,\u201d the strategist added. \u201cHe didn\u2019t always get appreciated for it on the right until it came to fights like Merrick Garland. The way the left attacked him on Merrick Garland was what the right needed to hear to turn him into that folk hero.\u201d\n\nTeam McConnell's meme acumen has been so impressive that it\u2019s been noticed by others in the conservative social media universe. \u201cCarpeDonktum,\u201d a Trump meme-maker whose video edits have been reposted by the president, called McConnell \u201cextremely memeable\u201d based on the contrast between the wild \u201cCocaine Mitch\u201d persona and his reserved nature.\n\n\u201cIt's become endearing,\u201d CarpeDonktum wrote in a Twitter direct message with The Daily Beast. \u201cThe interplay of the two competing ideas... Drug Kingpin Mitch McConnell. The right is very good at embracing ludicrous branding and turning it on its head.\u201d\n\nOn Reddit\u2019s pro-Trump \u201cThe_Donald\u201d forum, Trump fans gush over the majority leader they call \u201cThe Turtle\u201d\u2014in honor of his reptilian resemblance\u2014festooning posts about him with turtle emojis.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s show this hero-turtle some love!\u201d read one highly upvoted post about McConnell from October.\n\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S OUR TURTLE,\u201d cheered another after the Senate confirmed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nBut the pro-Trump internet posters who have embraced McConnell because he infuriates liberals have also turned their meming abilities against McConnell when he\u2019s fallen out of line with the president. That\u2019s never more true when it comes to the inability of Congress to pass money to fund the border wall.\n\n\u201cGenerally he has been supportive of Trump's agenda, but you never know where he will fall,\u201d CarpeDonktum said.\n\nObservers of the McConnell meme phenomenon acknowledge that there is some separation between hardcore pro-Trump people on social media and those who get their kicks by posting triumphant McConnell GIFs. But the expectation is that those universes will continue to overlap and that McConnell\u2019s Garland troll will simply be the opening salvo for 2020.\n\n\u201c If history is your guide,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cmy guess is that you\u2019ll see a lot more \u2018Cocaine Mitch\u2019 this cycle.\u201d", "description": "As he gears up for his 2020 reelection bid, Mitch McConnell is going all in on internet trolling.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Will Sommer", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1555987852/190422-Brodey-Sommer-Mitch-McConnell-tease_a4yds4"}
