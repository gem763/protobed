I was more sanguine this time\u2026 then it happens again.\"\n\nGreenpeace campaigner Kaisa Kosonen tweeted: \"Impossible is becoming possible in front of our very eyes.\"\n\nFor more facts about how our energy consumption needs to change to help fight climate change, download your BBC Briefing on energy. BBC Briefing is a new mini-series of online guides to the key issues in the news.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it's great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.\n\n\"Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs.\"\n\nHis critics point out that de-carbonising the electricity sector is accepted as the easy part of tackling climate change.\n\nThe government the has been repeatedly criticised by MPs for failing to curb emissions from transport and homes - and for not acknowledging that to curb climate change, many drivers need to leave their cars at home and walk, cycle or go by public transport.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter", "description": "The UK announces projects to power seven million homes with wind power - and no need for subsidy.", "authors": ["Roger Harrabin", "Bbc Environment Analyst"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A8DC/production/_108882234_gettyimages-849990116.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
