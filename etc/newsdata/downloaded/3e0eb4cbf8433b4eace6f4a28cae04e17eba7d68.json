I just knew I wouldn\u2019t get caught.\"\n\nHandler has always been candid about her life and career. Earlier this year, while promoting her memoir, Life Will Be the Death of Me: ... and you too!, she expressed how she felt \"broken\" after the death of her brother, Chet, who died at age 21 after falling off a cliff during a 1984 hiking trip in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nHandler was the youngest of six kids, while Chet was the oldest. She told USA Today that her late brother occupies a special place in her heart. \"[He was] kind of my protector, kind of a father figure, a big brother, a crush, your first boyfriend,\" she said. \"You just feel broken.\"\n\nWatch Handler's Red Table Talk episode on Monday at 9:00 a.m. PT / 12:00 p.m. ET on Facebook Watch.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nWill Smith Calls Emergency Family 'Red Table Talk' After Hitting His Highest Weight Ever\n\nWill Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith Get Candid About Alcohol Use in 'Red Table Talk' Sneak Peek\n\nJada Pinkett Smith Reacts to Oprah Winfrey Comparisons With Success of 'Red Table Talk' (Exclusive)\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "In a preview of Monday's episode, the TV personality shares eye-opening truths about her past.", "authors": ["Liz Calvario"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o3SOifX4A5TenIC_jgjWpQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/647f12b4d0fb17b153545d65bfdd3439", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
