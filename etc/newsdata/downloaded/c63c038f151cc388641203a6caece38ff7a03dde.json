If market prices rise enough, total return to maturity goes negative. Most of world's neg rate bonds are this way.\n\n--Yes, lack of elders/senior citizens etc getting no return on savings likely hurts economies such as Europe. Not easy to see the escape path for Europe to get back to savers earning real money. Long ago our fed controlled saver rates via regulation Q (memory)...which provided a fixed rate, locking in both upside and downside interest to be paid to such accounts. My recollection was a reg Q mandating 3%.\n\n--pensions could own the means of production, aka companies, aka stock shares, aka mutual funds to better meet long run needs. Also owning real estate rentals could go in the mix. Is there any choice?\n\n--bond convexity not discussed, which is the huge, magnified bond price changes, up or down, that go along with zero to negative rate bonds. Very risky to navigate. Someone will end up losing big-time, as bonds mature.\n\nBTW I consider if the reserve currency (USA) goes to negative rates, it will have very large negative impact, and be unworkable. I also consider the USA will never get to negative...or even zero rates. For host of reasons...including the front-running sellers who exit (including me and the 3 bond kings recently!), realizing the bond game is up.\n\nR48", "description": "Jim Bianco has posted a compelling essay at Bloomberg.
