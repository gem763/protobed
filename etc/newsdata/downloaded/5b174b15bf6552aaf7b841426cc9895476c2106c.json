But I\u2019m a black transgender woman, and people don\u2019t just let us live our lives.\n\nThe manager came up to the stall door, and started looking through the cracks. She appeared to be scanning my body up and down. I got very scared. I clenched my purse to cover myself. I felt she was trying to look at my genitals, attempting to determine my gender. I asked her to leave while she continued to ask whether I was a man.\n\nVideo of trans women forced from LA bar prompts hate crime investigation Read more\n\nFinally, she left. I washed my hands and walked out of the bathroom to try to speak to her about what had happened. I\u2019m a human that deserves privacy in the bathroom. Why did she think this was OK?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d the manager responded.\n\nI felt demoralized, devalued and powerless. I got back to my car and sat in the parking lot. I had planned to work that day for Lyft in San Francisco. Instead, I drove home to Oakland in a fog. I told my partner what happened and broke down crying angrily.\n\nThe incident affected me in many ways.\n\nI\u2019m a musician and was preparing to be a headliner at a Utah pride festival, I had just been featured in Billboard. I was signing a deal to compose for a ballet. I wanted to focus on my career.\n\nBut what had happened exacerbated my anxiety, stress and paranoia. For a while, I wasn\u2019t leaving the house \u2013 fearful of being harassed. I grew increasingly depressed, to the point that I was dropping the ball on my life. I started waiting to get home to use the bathroom, because I felt like it was the safest thing to do. I had regressed and had to rebuild my strength just to walk in and use a bathroom.\n\nThe smell of In-N-Out still bothers me.\n\nI had learned to put my head down and get through things. But I couldn\u2019t just let this go. It felt important for me to stand up and say something.\n\nThe US supreme court is about to hear a case on whether it should be legal to discriminate against people for being trans. The Trump administration is arguing that employers should be allowed to tell people that they can\u2019t work somewhere because of who they are.\n\nThe administration is taking a subset of society, and saying it\u2019s OK to treat the people in that subset poorly, to treat them without dignity and respect, that they are less than. Because of Trump, people have been emboldened to think that this kind of stuff is OK, and I\u2019m less safe for it. I don\u2019t know what to do. Being trans and black can feel impossible most days.\n\nDiscriminating against a person simply because you don\u2019t like who they are should be against the law. No one is asking for special accommodations.\n\nI know my rights. California\u2019s laws are very clear: I can use the bathroom that matches my gender identity.\n\nSo I filed a discrimination complaint against In-N-Out. I wanted changes in policies. I wanted the company to learn and understand. They will have other LGBT customers.\n\nIn a recent mediation, In-N-Out\u2019s lawyers made it clear that they do not feel the company did anything wrong. It felt as if they told me I was worth nothing. They offered me a settlement that I found offensive. I said no.\n\nBut I won\u2019t be silent. When it comes to black and brown trans folks, it feels like we don\u2019t matter. Why can\u2019t we exist in peace and have the same rights other people have? Why should somebody else\u2019s opinion of what I should be get to dictate what my existence is? I\u2019m asking that we are able to go about our lives and use the bathroom, without you kicking open the door and dragging us out.\n\nThere are parts of the LGBT community that have a lot more power and money, and the gay white folks who pushed for marriage equality should be fighting for us, too. We need to be together on this.\n\nIf they come for us, they\u2019ll come for other folks. This doesn\u2019t stop at us, it starts with us.\n\nAsked to comment on LeahAnn Mitchell\u2019s claims, an In-N-Out spokesperson said the company did not harass her or discriminate against her and that the manager was not aware she was transgender. A customer had repeatedly \u201craised the concern of a man being in the women\u2019s restroom\u201d, the statement said.\n\nIn an internal company report on the incident, the manager said she entered the bathroom and called out \u201cSir?\u201d and that when Mitchell answered \u201cExcuse me?\u201d, the manager responded, \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2013 we had a customer let us know there was a gentleman in here so I was just checking.\u201d She said she then exited.\n\n\u201cWhere we offer male and female restrooms, our expectation is that our customers will use the restroom consistent with their gender identity or gender expression, regardless of their biological sex,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe company declined to make the manager available for an interview.\n\nLeahAnn Mitchell is a California-based musician who performs as Lafemmebear.", "description": "Ahead of a crucial supreme court decision, LeahAnn Mitchell writes about her experience with discrimination", "authors": ["Leahann Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6215bbcbe1e2ec9b75c2df86b995ed2d790aad99/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13a6bbeb0ea124b0fcc0e7858ae07eb5", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
