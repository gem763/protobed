Photo: Frank Augstein/AP\n\nThe pound surged on Tuesday after the UK Supreme Court ruled that prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s five-week suspension of parliament was unlawful.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling, the court said that Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen, which prompted the suspension of parliament, was unlawful because it had the effect of \u201cfrustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201d\n\nThe suspension itself \u2014 known as prorogation \u2014 was also therefore unlawful and void, the court said.\n\nParliament can therefore be recalled immediately, meaning that MPs now have extra time to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe pound climbed by as much as 0.2% against the dollar (GBPUSD=X) to about \u00a31.247, before falling back slightly. It similarly surged against the euro (GBPEUR=X).\n\n\u201cThe pound has spiked higher after the Supreme Court delivered a shocking blow to the government and the prime minister,\u201d said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, in a note.\n\nThe decision of the court is one of the most significant constitutional rulings made in the UK in recent decades.\n\nThe pound popped against the dollar on Tuesday after the ruling. Chart: Yahoo Finance UK More\n\nThe court said that the decision to prorogue parliament was \u201cextreme\u201d and that no justification had been provided to the court for taking this action.\n\nBecause the advice given to the Queen was unlawful, and because the order which led to the prorogation was unlawful, the prorogation itself \u201cwas also void and of no effect,\u201d the court ruled.\n\n\u201cParliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 justices,\u201d the court said.\n\nIn a statement, speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow said that he welcomed the judgment.\n\n\u201cThe judges have rejected the government\u2019s claim that closing down parliament for five weeks was merely standard practice to allow for a new Queen's Speech,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn reaching their conclusion, they have vindicated the right and duty of parliament to meet at this crucial time to scrutinise the executive and hold ministers to account.\u201d\n\nParliament was previously due to return on 14 October, just two weeks before the 31 October Brexit deadline.\n\n\u201cFundamentally it\u2019s hard to see how this gets the UK and EU any closer to a deal that will be approved by MPs, but it does really deliver a massive blow to Boris Johnson,\u201d said Wilson.\n\nThough the currency has weakened significantly since the June 2016 Brexit referendum, it has climbed in recent weeks after Johnson experienced a number of stunning defeats in parliament.\n\nAhead of the suspension of parliament earlier this month, a group of rebel MPs, including many from Johnson\u2019s own Conservative party, passed a law to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOver the course of three days, the Supreme Court heard two appeals, one from Brexit campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller, and another from the government.\n\nMiller was appealing against a ruling in the English High Court, which found that Johnson\u2019s suspension was a \u201cpurely political\u201d matter and not something that should be adjudicated in the courts.\n\nJohnson\u2019s government, meanwhile, was appealing against a ruling from the Scottish Court of Session, whose judges unanimously found that the prorogation was unlawful.", "description": "In a unanimous ruling, the court said that Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen, which prompted the suspension of parliament, was unlawful.", "authors": ["Edmund Heaphy", "Finance", "News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1phP0PddyOYKQgIZ62MeOQ--~B/aD0zMjg3O3c9NTIzODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/3f168720-dea2-11e9-bae4-f60647c8bd4a", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
