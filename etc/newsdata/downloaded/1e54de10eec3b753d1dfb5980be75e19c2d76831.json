They said:\n\n\u201cWe were surprised and disappointed that the SEC chose to file the lawsuit under these circumstances, and we disagree with the SEC's legal position.\u201d\n\nIn addition to declaring the token offering illegal, the SEC has also issued a temporary restraining order on the issuance of Gram tokens, with a court hearing scheduled for Oct. 24.", "description": "Telegram\u2019s pledge to return money to investors in the event of a delay to the launch of its blockchain network may be superseded by a \u201cforce majeure\u201d clause in...", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOTU5ZDgyYjBmMGU5MjRjNGY3NzFiODI3NDljZjhkZjkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
