This is a tricky but not uncommon question \u2013 with a number of recent high-profile legal cases highlighting the limits of parents\u2019 rights to decide what treatments should be offered.\n\nThe issue has been brought into the spotlight again after the parents and healthcare team of Tafida Raqeeb disagreed about whether she should be offered life-sustaining treatment.\n\nTafida\u2019s parents wanted to take her to Italy for treatment, but a spokesperson for Barts Health NHS Trust, where she is being cared for, said that: \u201cfurther medical treatment would not improve her condition\u201d.\n\nThe High Court ruled that \u201clife-sustaining treatment\u201d for Tafida must continue \u2013 and Barts NHS Trust\u2019s application to withdraw life support was dismissed. Tafida\u2019s parents argued that under Islam only God*Allah* can make the decision to end her life, and so they wished to continue treatment.\n\nConflicts between parents of very sick children and hospital staff are not uncommon, and often become high-profile when legal interventions are triggered.\n\nTafida\u2019s case is typical of healthcare conflict \u2013 clinicians are reluctant to offer treatments that are likely to be futile and parents are desperate to try everything for their child \u2013 even if the odds of success are low.\n\nAt the heart of such cases is a breakdown in communication between the clinicians and the family about what is in the child\u2019s best interests \u2013 so the law intervenes when relationships fail.\n\nHuge emotional impact\n\nI\u2019ve been conducting research for many years in the field of healthcare conflict in children\u2019s hospitals, and other healthcare settings, including adult palliative care. Families losing trust in clinicians is a key cause of conflict \u2013 along with poor communication and different ideas about the goals of care for a child.\n\nDifferent cultural or religious beliefs also complicate communication about what treatments are considered essential or burdensome.\n\nThese factors all combine, particularly, if the child has a very complex condition requiring clinicians from a range of different specialities and where the child has a life-limiting prognosis.\n\nTreatment decisions are usually made jointly between parents and clinicians. Parents often have some discretion to try approaches clinicians do not favour, but ultimately hospitals keep the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d as the main focus.\n\nMy work has shown how conflict creates huge emotional and financial costs for both families and clinicians. In one study it was estimated that 448 hours of staff time was used in managing conflict in one children\u2019s hospital over a period of 24 weeks \u2013 and that this time cost the NHS more than \u00a39,000.\n\nIn our research, we have documented how conflict escalates. Initial conflict might include insensitive use of language, staff giving conflicting messages about a child\u2019s status, or a history of unresolved conflict in other services.\n\nConflict then escalates to include repetitive arguments, staff or families avoiding contact with each other, and families micromanaging or documenting all care activities.\n\nAt the most severe level of conflict, the relationship between staff and family disintegrates \u2013 the conflict takes on a life of its own and staff can experience physical and verbal threats and attacks.\n\nWe interviewed 30 staff \u2013 some of whom, as a result of such conflicts, had been left anxious and bruised.\n\nCrisis cases\n\nOur research has also highlighted how it takes considerable skill and courage for healthcare staff to manage conflict with the parents of very sick children.\n\nAnd hospital staff often have no right to reply when conflict cases make the news. Bound by patient confidentiality they have no voice to express the profound and lasting impact such conflicts and court cases have on them and they are unable to publicly talk about being threatened or attacked at work.\n\nResearch shows that providing staff with training in mediation skills helps. Six months after receiving training, 57% of health care staff had experienced conflict \u2013 of whom 91% reported that the training had enabled them to de-escalate the situation.\n\nPart of the training centres on fostering empathy and supporting staff to listen to parental anxiety. We use a video produced by a health provider in the US \u2013 the Cleveland Clinic \u2013 which powerfully illustrates the need for both staff and families to empathise with each other.\n\nWe have also tested a new conflict management framework, that was developed by the Medical Mediation Foundation \u2013 which helps to resolve conflicts between health professionals and families in the UK \u2013 as a way of deescalating conflict.\n\nThe framework offers staff a structured approach to talking with families about disagreements, documenting discussions and escalating concerns. Early results from this study in a children\u2019s cancer centre indicate that the framework can help to reduce the frequency and severity of conflict.\n\nIt is clear there must be compassion for both families and staff who are supporting children with complex and life-limiting illness. Keeping these cases out of the courts has to be a core objective. Spotting conflicts in their early stages and training staff in mediation skills both have considerable potential to keep these cases out of the courts \u2013 and that has to be good for the child, the parents and the clinicians.\n\nLiz Forbat, Associate Professor of Ageing, University of Stirling\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
