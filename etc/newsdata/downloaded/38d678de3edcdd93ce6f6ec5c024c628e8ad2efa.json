The fact that, six years later, real car companies are still taking time to work on these one-offs is a testament to the impact of the PlayStation driving game. Jaguar is the latest to join the fray; it kindly sent out a bunch of images of a car it's calling the Jaguar Vision Gran Turismo Coup\u00e9.\n\n\"This was the dream project for a car designer; creating a futuristic sports car for Gran Turismo means our designs and ideas could be truly limitless. It has to excite future generations and most importantly, look and feel unmistakably Jaguar,\" said Oliver Cattell-Ford, exterior designer at Jaguar Advanced Design. The Vision GT Coup\u00e9 draws inspiration from some of its legendary racers of old: there's some Le Mans-winning C-Type in the front fenders, while the profile harks back to the long-nose D-Type. Meanwhile, the lightweight E-Type was on the mood board for the Vision GT Coup\u00e9's pared-back cockpit.\n\nChris Shaw, who led the interior design team, had this to say:\n\nWe've really pushed the limit to imagine how a future Jaguar sports car interior could look. The architecture is visually lightweight, simple, and dramatic; featuring advanced and experimental materials and finishes. Sitting in the stunningly considered cockpit and looking out onto the gracefully long bonnet of the Jaguar Vision GT Coup\u00e9\u2014a view that is unmistakably Jaguar\u2014the player will be fully immersed in the action.\n\nNormally with decades-away concepts like this, there's no point even discussing the putative technical specs. But in this case, the car will be drivable\u2014in GT Sport, that is\u2014so the specs bear some mention. The Vision is fully electric, with one motor for the front axle and then one for each rear wheel, with a combined 750kW (1,005hp) and 1,200Nm (885lb-ft). Top speed is 200mph (321km/h), and the car hits 62mph (100km/h) from a standing start in under two seconds.\n\nTo make sure the Vision is competitive in the game, Jaguar even got its Formula E racing team involved. James Barclay, team principal for Jaguar Racing, said this:\n\nThe opportunity to take what we have learned on the track from our time in Formula E and apply it to a futuristic Jaguar race car has been a great challenge for the Jaguar Racing engineers. With its all-electric motor design drawing on the technology from both the Jaguar I-TYPE 4 and eTROPHY race cars, we have accurately modeled the performance of the Jaguar Vision GT Coup\u00e9 in the virtual world, creating a car that will be exhilarating to drive and a real threat to the competition.\n\nThe Vision GT Coup\u00e9 will be available as a free download in GT Sport in November.\n\nListing image by Jaguar", "description": "Inspired by the C-Type and D-Type, it's a free download for GT Sport in November.", "authors": ["Jonathan M.
