But it managed just two runs against Gray (11-7) before Michael Lorenzen and Raisel Iglesias closed out the five-hitter for Cincinnati.\n\n\u201cSonny just keeps pitching great,\u201d Reds manager David Bell said. \u201cHe went deep into the game against a great lineup. It doesn\u2019t really matter who he\u2019s facing right now, the best teams, the best lineups. He\u2019s pitching with that much confidence.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs (82-69) dropped into a tie for the second NL wild card with Milwaukee, which held off San Diego for a 3-1 victory. They also missed out on an opportunity to gain ground on NL Central-leading St. Louis, which lost 6-2 to Washington.\n\nRookie Aristides Aquino hit his 16th homer for Cincinnati (71-81), and Joey Votto and Eugenio Su\u00e1rez each drove in a run.\n\nGray struck out nine in 6 2/3 innings. The All-Star right-hander improved to 5-1 with a 1.46 ERA in his last nine outings\n\n\u201cI felt pretty good out there today after I kind of got going,\u201d Gray said.\n\nYu Darvish (6-7) struck out 13 in seven innings for Chicago, but was hurt by a slow start. Kyle Schwarber had three hits and two RBIs.\n\nDarvish fanned 14 in his previous start, a 4-1 win at San Diego on Thursday. He has 217 Ks in 170 1/3 innings on the year.\n\n\u201cYu is on quite a run right now, but unfortunately their guy is really good, too,\u201d Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. \u201cIn spite of us swinging the bats well lately, Sonny did a nice job also.\u201d\n\nGray departed with runners on the corners, and Lorenzen struck out Nicholas Castellanos to end the inning.\n\nLorenzen then worked the eighth before Iglesias pitched a perfect ninth for his 32nd save.\n\nDarvish struck out the side in the first, but Cincinnati scored three times. Votto doubled home Josh VanMeter before Aquino hit a drive to left-center for his first homer since Sept. 2.\n\nAquino, who was recalled from the minors on Aug. 1, has six homers against Chicago in six games.\n\n\u201cI made a good pitch to Votto, but he\u2019s a great hitter,\u201d Darvish said. \u201cFor Aquino, that\u2019s my mistake. I should throw a breaking ball.\u201d\n\nGray helped himself in the fifth, reaching on a one-out single and eventually coming around on Su\u00e1rez\u2019s base hit to give Cincinnati a 4-2 lead.\n\nAll-Star catcher Willson Contreras started at first base in Chicago\u2019s second game since Anthony Rizzo sprained his right ankle during Sunday\u2019s 16-6 victory over Pittsburgh. Rizzo is wearing a walking boot for five to seven days, casting doubt on the slugger\u2019s availability for the rest of the season.\n\nSchwarber drove in Castellanos with a double in the first and a triple in the third.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nReds: Votto was back in the starting lineup after missing two games with an illness. \u2026 SS Jos\u00e9 Iglesias (sore back) was out of the lineup for a fourth straight game, but pinch-hit in the ninth and struck out. \u2026 INF Freddy Galvis missed his third straight game with left knee soreness. Bell said Galvis could return this weekend.\n\nCubs: RHP Craig Kimbrell (elbow inflammation) threw 16 pitches in a simulated inning. Maddon said the closer\u2019s session \u201cwas very encouraging,\u201d but cautioned the team needed to wait until Wednesday to evaluate Kimbrel\u2019s response before determining a next step. \u2026 All-Star SS Javier B\u00e1ez (hairline fracture in left thumb) will visit with doctors this week in advance of resuming training activity. B\u00e1ez expected to miss the rest of the regular season. \u2026 RHP Brandon Kintzler (right oblique strain) could resume throwing in the next few days, pitching coach Tommy Hottovy said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nReds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-11, 5.11 ERA) faces Cubs left-hander Jon Lester (13-10, 4.59 ERA) in the series finale Wednesday night. Lester has allowed 15 runs (12 earned) over 10 1/3 innings in his last two starts.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Chicago Cubs had been scoring in bunches lately.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Carlson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/reds_cubs_baseball_11703_c0-138-3300-2062_s1770x1032.jpg?e1f564f8f6be3edbe5b27839a1e93c520c57831d", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
