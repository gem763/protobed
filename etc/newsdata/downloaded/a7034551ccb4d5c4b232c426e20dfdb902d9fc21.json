Scorsese compared Marvel movies to theme park rides, while Coppola went one step further, calling superhero flicks \u201cdespicable.\u201d Iger responded directly to Coppola\u2019s choice of word, stating \u201cI reserve the word \u2018despicable\u2019 for someone who committed mass murder.\u201d\n\nVarious actors and directors involved in Marvel projects, including Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan, and Jon Favreau have spoken out about the comments, but Iger\u2019s are the most condemning. The Disney CEO said he was \u201cpuzzled\u201d by the criticism, adding that it\u2019s \u201cdisrespectful to all the people who work on those films.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they want to bitch about movies, it\u2019s certainly their right,\u201d Iger said, as reported by The Wrap. \u201cAre you telling me that Ryan Coogler making Black Panther is doing something that somehow or another is less than anything Marty Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola have ever done on any one of their movies? Come on.\u201d\n\nScorsese and Coppola\u2019s comments can be seen as inflammatory, but neither attacked any individual filmmaker. Instead, the comments were directed at the state of Hollywood right now. Netflix is distributing Scorsese\u2019s latest film, The Irishman, reportedly in part because major studios didn\u2019t want to take a chance on the $160 million budget. That\u2019s less than what a studio might spend on a Transformers movie, but blockbuster films are seen as more potentially lucrative because they tend to perform better at the global box office. Director Ken Loach told Sky News that superhero films are \u201ca cynical exercise [that] has nothing to do with the art of cinema.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that blockbuster films, recently including a huge wave of superhero movies, dominate the theatrical calendar. Disney is set to release four Marvel movies in 2021: Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Thor: Love and Thunder, and a third Spider-Man movie in partnership with Sony Pictures. That doesn\u2019t account for Warner Bros.\u2019 DC film slate, or other superhero projects from other studios. It also doesn\u2019t include the slate of new Marvel Studios TV shows on Disney+ that will weave in and out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\u201cSuperheroes are simply today\u2019s gangsters/cowboys/outer space adventurers,\u201d Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn said in an Instagram post.\n\nStudios\u2019 current bias toward epic-scale escapist movies can be maddening for legacy directors of more adult-oriented dramas, many who have spoken out against the current film landscape. Netflix has become a go-to spot for directors who want to produce other types of films, with some crediting the streaming platform with taking a chance on more independent projects. Netflix is starting to release more of its original films in theaters, as part of a push to court awards and mainstream attention. That\u2019s given directors a chance at theatrical releases, even though Netflix is still a subscriber-oriented streaming platform first and foremost.\n\nStill, it\u2019s important not to lose sight of what Scorsese actually said. His comments weren\u2019t a condemnation of Marvel movies so much as a nostalgic longing for a version of Hollywood that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. And Iger\u2019s defense \u2014 or Stan\u2019s and Downey Jr.\u2019s \u2014 isn\u2019t a shot at Scorsese and Coppola\u2019s brilliance; it\u2019s embracing a cinematic world that has connected them with fans around the world.\n\n\u201cHonestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks,\u201d Scorsese said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u201d", "description": "There\u2019s a war brewing between some of Hollywood\u2019s most revered directors and fans of Disney\u2019s Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the latter camp just got some help from Disney CEO Bob Iger.
