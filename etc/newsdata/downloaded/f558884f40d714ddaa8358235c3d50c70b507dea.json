During the appearance she described her family life as being like a \u201csitcom,\u201d but it sounds like it may be closer to a horror movie. These spooky revelations were prompted when Fallon asked her, \u201cIs Wyoming real?\u201d (whoa, deep) to find out the truth about the Kardashian Wests moving out to the ranch Kanye bought. Kim assured the audience that \u201cI love L.A.\u201d and that if she has it her way, the ranch will be more of a weekends and holidays property for the family of six. Based on her description though, the literal Cabin in the Woods sounds like a ranch in the Spahn sense, good for a long weekend getaway if that long weekend starts on a Friday the 13th. As Kim tells it:\n\nIt\u2019s like, you know, 5,000 acres or something. So we\u2019re driving, driving up. We brought three of the kids. We go up to this cabin at the top. No electricity. iPads died. He falls asleep, so now I\u2019m with the three kids. No bathroom [\u2026] So there\u2019s now no lights, I\u2019m scared to death that a bear or something\u2019s gonna come. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s bears there, but some animal\u2019s gonna get us. [\u2026] My phone dies. There\u2019s literally like no service, no nothing. I\u2019m peeing in a bottle.\n\nWho\u2019s their travel agent? Blumhouse? The only image more haunting than Kim Kardashian West left alone in a cabin in the dark with three children, no phone signal, peeing in a bottle \u2026 is the time Kanye trapped Kenny G in a haunted labyrinth of roses as a gift to Kim. Their story did have a sitcom ending though: The next morning, after improbably surviving the night and making breakfast \u201con a fire thing,\u201d Kim and Kanye went on a walk around the property to find \u2026 an entire functioning hotel. We love a good twist!", "description": "On \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d promoting her new line of shapewear, Skims, Kim Kardashian West told Jimmy a story about staying overnight at a rustic cabin Kanye West bought for the family.
