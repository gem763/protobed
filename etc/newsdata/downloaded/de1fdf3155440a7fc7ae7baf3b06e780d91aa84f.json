And why does his resignation matter?", "language": "en", "text": "It was the latest bombshell Brexit news and could have implications for Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union.\n\nTraditionally, the speaker of the House of Commons is not a household name. But Bercow is not a low-wattage character.\n\nHis colorful ties and even more colorful oratory helped him become a made-for-YouTube star, delighting fans around the world with his rhetorical flourishes. His memorable put-downs \u2014 telling lawmakers to \u201ctake up yoga\u201d or go on \u201ctherapeutic training\u201d courses \u2014 have gone viral. His best moments have inspired memes and mash-ups.\n\nHe has also played a central role in the clash between the executive and the legislature at a pivotal time in Britain\u2019s history \u2014 and the candidates running to replace him will have to indicate whether they intend to emulate or avoid his model.\n\nBercow\u2019s supporters say he is one of the most reforming speakers in modern times, and that his efforts have given backbench lawmakers a bigger voice.\n\nHis critics accuse him of bullying and bending conventions in a way that favors the pro-E.U. side, both of which he denies.\n\n\u201cThroughout my time as speaker I have sought to increase the relative authority of this legislature for which I will make absolutely no apology to anyone, anywhere, at anytime,\u201d Bercow said Monday in an emotional address, with his wife, Sally, looking on from the gallery.\n\nHe had, he said, \u201csought to be the backbenchers backstop.\u201d\n\nThat was the case on Monday, as he permitted lawmakers to control the legislative agenda and seek to hold Johnson and his ministers to account.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me young man from a sedentary position what I can and cannot say,\u201d he bellowed at one point. \u201cQuite frankly, young man, you can like it or lump it.\u201d\n\nJohnson was set to suspend Parliament on Monday night for five weeks, a decision that Bercow previously called a \u201cconstitutional outrage.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post in May, Bercow denied rumors that he would soon leave his post. \u201cI think it would be rather curious to desert my post at a time like this,\u201d he said.\n\nBut on Monday, he told the Commons that \u201cat the 2017 election, I promised my wife and children that it would be my last. This is a pledge that I intend to keep.\u201d\n\nConservatives had, in recent days, threatened to challenge him in the next election \u2014 a breach of protocol, which dictates the speaker\u2019s seat is not contested.\n\nThe fact that Bercow is a divisive figure was on stark display Monday, as many opposition lawmakers got up to applaud him for his service, while some of the hardcore Brexiteers stayed in their seats.\n\nTributes lasted for more than an hour.\n\nMichael Gove, a senior member of the government, said that, \u201cfrom time to time, those of us on this side of the House may have bridled or chastened at some of the judgments that you have made,\u201d but he added that he was \u201cnever in any doubt\u201d that Bercow had operated on the basis that the executive was accountable to Parliament.\n\n\u201cYour love of democracy is transparent in everything that you say and do,\u201d he said.\n\nGove also thanked Bercow for his \u201cenergetic efforts\u201d at discipline, which he said was appreciated \u201ceven by those of us who may not always be the best behaved in class.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said Bercow had been a \u201csuperb\u201d speaker who had totally changed the way in which the job has been done.\n\nBrexit is hardly lacking in drama, but for those who tuned into parliamentary television to hear Bercow\u2019s (often ignored) pleas for \u201cOrder!!!!,\u201d it won\u2019t be quite the same.\n\nBoris Johnson expected to lose motion for early election\n\nBoris Johnson has four options to escape his Brexit mess. One of them is to go to jail.\n\n\u2018The Trumpization of U.K. politics\u2019: Boris Johnson is busting political norms\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Bercow played an outsized role in the clash between the executive and legislature over Brexit.", "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LKRKE7GTHEI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
