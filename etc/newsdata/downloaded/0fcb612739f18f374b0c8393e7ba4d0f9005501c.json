A spokesman with the local prefecture said 21 people had been arrested.\n\nTelevision footage showed groups of black-clad protesters trying to break into shops, while police trucks carrying water cannon were seen arriving on scene.\n\nThe Gilets Jaunes (yellow vest) protests, named after motorists\u2019 high-visibility jackets, began over fuel tax increases but morphed into a sometimes violent revolt against Macron and a government they see as out of touch.\n\nThe president has sought to ease tensions with 17 billion euros (\u00a315.05 billion) of countermeasures to boost the monthly minimum wage, remove some taxes, and offer relief to poor retirees. But he faces a new round of anger with a long-awaited reform that seeks to merge France\u2019s 42 different pension systems into a single points-based system.\n\nParisian commuters faced travel misery on Friday as metro workers went on strike over plans to reduce their retirement privileges.
