California\n\nWhat time is the press conference today?\n\nIn the UK, the stream will begin from around 9pm, which is 4pm Eastern and 1pm Western in the US.\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nIt will be on both KSI and Logan\u2019s respective YouTube channels.\n\nWhen will the rematch happen?\n\nThe bout is set to take place on 9th November, 2019. We\u2019re not too far off then.\n\nWhere will the rematch take place?\n\nThe fight between the two YouTube sensations will take place at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles, California.

You can buy them right here.\n\nWhere will I be able to watch the fight?\n\nIf you\u2019re not going to the fight itself, you can watch it on DAZN in the United States and from around the world and if you\u2019re in the UK, you\u2019ll have to stay tuned \u2013 no announcement has been made on broadcasting rights just yet.", "description": "KSI\u00a0and\u00a0Logan Paul\u00a0will\u00a0come face to face today for the first time since they fought in front of 18,000 at the Manchester Arena last year.
