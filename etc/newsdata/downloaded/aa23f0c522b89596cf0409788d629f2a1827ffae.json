Amy O\u2019Rourke, who has previously shied away from the press, will make her solo campaign trail debut in a three-day stop in New Hampshire later this week, the beginning of what's planned to be an aggressive campaign swing.\n\nAccording to the O\u2019Rourke campaign, two recent deadly mass shootings in Texas was the latest of several factors motivating her to step out of her comfort zone and embrace the role head-on, pushing for schedules as packed as her husband\u2019s. While in New Hampshire, Amy O\u2019Rourke is set to join a roundtable discussion on gun violence with self-described \u201cpeaceful and nonviolent grassroots\u201d organization Kent Street Coalition on Sept. 5 to discuss gun reform.\n\nO\u2019Rourke adds that she\u2019s particularly eager to discuss gun violence prevention: \u201cI want to hear about the efforts of local activists across the state including parents in New Hampshire, help lift their voices, and do my part in pushing for common sense gun reform.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo News, Amy O\u2019Rourke said she was \u201cexcited\u201d to hit the campaign trail. \u201cI am going to New Hampshire to listen and learn about issues on the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be visiting with small-business owners, supporting a down-ballot race, and visiting [the University of New Hampshire] to speak with student journalists who, like so many young people, are leading the charge on climate change, equality and college affordability.\u201d\n\n\n\nLater that same day, she will make a play to college-age voters as a guest on WUNH-FM, the student radio station, and then move on to door knocking for Naomi Andrews, a Democrat running for state representative in the state\u2019s special election \u2014 mirroring her husband\u2019s push to make down-ballot initiatives central to his campaign\u2019s dogma. Last week Beto O\u2019Rourke canvassed for Amy Laufer and Dan Helmer, who are both running in local elections in Virginia.\n\nOn Friday, Amy O\u2019Rourke will tour a local small business in Londonderry, then link up with her husband for joint events, concluding with the state\u2019s Democratic Party State Convention on Sept. 7.\n\nBack in early June, the couple traveled to Iowa for their first joint campaign event, and while Amy O\u2019Rourke made appearances at several stops, including a Cedar Rapids office opening and an immigration roundtable, she shied away from press rope lines, instead choosing to chat with supporters and event participants while her husband spoke with reporters. Later, however, she launched a new Instagram account and appeared on the notoriously combative morning show \u201cThe View.\u201d Her New Hampshire campaign swing \u2014 at least according to the campaign \u2014 will show O\u2019Rourke\u2019s more assertive side.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke faces an uphill battle when it comes to polling in New Hampshire; averages compiled by RealClearPolitics put the former Texas lawmaker polling around 1.3 percent. When his numbers dipped to similar levels in Iowa, O\u2019Rourke told Yahoo News that if he were elected president, \u201cno poll will guide the decisions that I make.\u201d\n\nAt a discussion at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, back in June, Beto O\u2019Rourke told Yahoo News that his wife\u2019s presence was a boon to his ground game. \u201cThe only risk is that someone wishes she were the candidate instead of me,\u201d he jokes, \u201cbut it\u2019s too late for that.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Amy O\u2019Rourke, wife of presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, will step out on the campaign trail solo after previously avoiding the spotlight.", "authors": ["Brittany Shepherd", "National Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XnLffrainbOC3K_.R8g9LA--~B/aD00NTk2O3c9Njg5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/c83223f0-cdd8-11e9-ae1f-f1376243b984"}
