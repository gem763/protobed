It\u2019s a who\u2019s who of rugby greats, with a total of five World Cup medals between them \u2013 and countless other trinkets and accolades, for that matter.\n\nIn this leafy corner of Tokyo, away from the neon shimmer of the city\u2019s pulsing centre, with its scrambled intersections and endless flow of people, it\u2019s quite a sight to see so many icons clustered in one area. Whereas in past years these men will have traded blows on the pitch, this time there\u2019s no hostiles or animosities. Those days are behind them.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Tackling, passing, kicking. It\u2019s rudimentary stuff \u2013 but while days like this will often blur into one for the leading stars, the smiles on the kids\u2019 faces suggest many will be walking away from such a session with memories to cherish.\n\nBecause as we gear up for Saturday\u2019s showdown between England and South Africa, it\u2019s worth remembering that this World Cup was always about more than just the attainment of glory. With the tournament making its debut in Asia, it has presented a golden opportunity to spread the game, to usher in new fans and followers. While the public imagination was left in awe after the exploits of the Brave Blossoms, the next step is maintaining that newfound interest among the Japanese population.\n\nIt may have been just one afternoon of rugby, but the effect of these sort of initiatives can endure long after the tournament has passed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the national team, it\u2019s about the grassroots of the game as well,\u201d says Dallaglio towards the end of the session. \u201cThe next generation hopefully will have been inspired by their heroes that they\u2019ve witnessed out on the field.\u201d\n\nYours,\n\nSam Lovett\n\nSports reporter", "description": "The whole gang is there.
