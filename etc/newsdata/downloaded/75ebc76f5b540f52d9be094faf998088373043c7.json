She liked the neighborhood feel there and had a backyard, so when she looked for another place she wanted outdoor space as well as parking and storage.\n\n\u201cThe Sage has everything I need, beautiful open space inside and outside,\u201d Kurtz said. \u201cI can sit on my balcony at night and watch the planes come in. I can see the skyline all the way to the left and even Meridian Hill Park, a bit to the right. When I walked in, the first thing that grabbed me was the light. I didn\u2019t even notice the [Washington] monument right away.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBalconies and glass walls: Unit 3 West spans the building, front to back, and has a balcony on both ends. One overlooks a green canopy of treetops with the Washington Monument in the far distance.\n\nThe MacGillis unit also has two outdoor spaces. \u201cWhen I walked in, the view was wonderful. I could see the Washington Monument. I was taken aback and knew I wanted to live here,\u201d MacGillis said.\n\nUnit 4 East, a corner penthouse unit, also spans the building, front to back, and has a glass back wall. An interior den was turned into a master bedroom suite that has a bed with a custom-built headboard-and-shelving structure. The shelving structure, with cubbyholes for little sculptures and other ornaments, rises to the ceiling.\n\nAD\n\nThe bedroom has a glass wall and glass door that face the living room, and behind the bed there is a walk-in closet and dressing room with built-in drawers. On the other end of the closet, a spacious master bathroom has a double shower, double-sink vanity and a toilet compartment.\n\nAD\n\nUp a flight of stairs, the unit has a small lounge and private roof deck with sweeping views.\n\nNearby: The popular Meridian Hill Park has lawns, a formal garden, a cascading fountain, statuary and lots of trees. Kurtz said she loves the drum circle on Sunday afternoons. \u201cPeople from the neighborhood come and jam for hours. Sometimes I go over there to watch, but I can also sit on my balcony and listen to the music,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be so close.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Former Residence of the Ambassadors of Spain and the Mexican Cultural Institute, both in the 2800 block of 16th Street NW, present cultural programming of the two countries. Films, exhibits, performances and other programs are free to the public. The buildings are also noteworthy for their architecture.\n\nThe neighborhood has a variety of restaurants, shops, bars, cafes, galleries and stores.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverything is within walking distance \u2014 from one of the best restaurants in the country, Maydan, to grocery shopping [and] cool shops,\u201d MacGillis said.\n\nSchools: Marie Reed Elementary, Columbia Heights Education Campus, Cardozo Education Campus.\n\nTransit: Columbia Heights, on the Green line, is the closest Metro station.\n\nAD\n\nSage\n\n1468 Belmont St. NW, Washington\n\nThe building has eight condominium units.
