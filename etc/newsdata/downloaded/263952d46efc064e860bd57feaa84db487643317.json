Analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast a range of $544 million to $557 million.\n\nThe Calgary-based company added 90,700 wireless customers during the quarter after analysts had expected fewer than the 85,000 new users added in the same period a year ago. Shaw\u2019s total of 1.7 million subscribers in three provinces makes it the largest regional wireless provider in Canada.\n\n\u201cWe have firmly established Freedom Mobile as the industry innovator and recognized champion of wireless affordability for Canadians,\u201d CEO Brad Shaw said in a statement Friday. \u201cThrough years of thoughtful and strategic capital investing, we have built a high quality, facilities-based wireless network that is capable of meeting the evolving needs of our customers and continuing to fuel Freedom\u2019s momentum.\u201d\n\nThe wireless unit, although small when compared to its main business as one of Western Canada\u2019s biggest internet and TV cable networks, began in 2016 when Shaw bought Wind Mobile. Over fiscal 2019, Shaw\u2019s Freedom launched in 19 new markets in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, bringing in 1.4 million new customers, it said.\n\nThe company forecasts 2020 free cash flow of $700 million compared with analysts estimating $577.6 million, Bloomberg said. Next year\u2019s capital spending prediction is $1.1 billion, slightly less than a range of $1.16 billion to $1.26 billion suggested by analysts, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe jump in expected free cash flow is \u201ca testament that the significant transformation undertaken in the past few years is yielding meaningful results that are flowing to the bottom line,\u201d CEO Shaw said.\n\nFourth quarter revenue rose 1.2 per cent to $1.35 billion though estimates had been in the range of $1.34 billion to $1.38 billion, Bloomberg said.\n\nNet income during the quarter was $167 million compared with $196 million in the year earlier period, primarily because of lower equity income associated with an investment in Corus, Shaw said.\n\nThe company stock was up 1.57 per cent to $25.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.", "description": "Freedom Mobile launched in 19 new markets in 2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/shaw-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
