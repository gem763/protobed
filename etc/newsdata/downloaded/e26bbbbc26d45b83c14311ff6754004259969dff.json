'Cause I heard it was coconut.\"\n\nNext, we see Grande, still dressed as a cheerleader, saying, \"Honestly, I'm not the biggest Ariana Grande fan, but I do hear the new fragrance is... somewhat promising.\"\n\n\"I heard she put part of her ponytail in it!\" says a student. We then see Grande do just that, cutting off a chunk of her iconic pony and putting it into a perfume distiller.\n\nWe then see blonde Grande in her bedroom with her Burn Book, in which she writes, \"THAT fragrance got the other girls shaking.\"\n\nCheck out the full video here.", "description": "Ariana Grande's single", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/ariana-grande-thank-you-next-fragrance-ad-ht-jc-190920_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
