He described his \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d as a successful effort to push the \u201cterrorists\u201d of the Kurdish YPG militia back until they could no longer support the PKK, the Kurdish separatist organization.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defense Ministry cited assurances from Russia that YPG units have been cleared from the border region, including the key cities of Manbij and Tal Rifat, and all heavy weapons have been removed.\n\n\u201cTurkey will never allow the formation of a terror corridor in the south of its borders, and our fight against the terrorist organizations, particularly Daesh and PKK/YPG, will continue with determination,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cDaesh\u201d is another name for the Islamic State.\n\nThe statement said that \u201cTurkish and Russian military delegations discussed tactical and technical aspects\u201d of beginning joint patrols of the Turkish-Syrian border \u2013 a curiously protracted series of discussions given the seemingly simple objective of ensuring there are no YPG military forces deployed in a fairly narrow stretch of land.\n\nThe Turks vaguely indicated the latest round of discussions with the Russian military were \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d and said, \u201cthe coordination will continue.\u201d Russian military police have begun patrolling in the safe zone, but there is no firm indication of when Turkish troops will join them.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Tuesday that discussions are underway with Russia and Iran to arrange the return of some two million refugees currently living in Turkey to \u201cterritories liberated from terrorists.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe aim at returning refugees, and this return should be safe, it should be carried out in accordance with international law, as well as in coordination with U.N. agencies,\u201d Cavusoglu said.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces (SDF) on Tuesday castigated Turkey and its Syrian allies for \u201clooting and theft\u201d in the region Turkey invaded and repeated its charges that Turkish forces continue to violate the ceasefire agreement.\n\nThe SDF characterized the Syrian fighters allied with Turkey as \u201cterrorist factions\u201d and \u201cmercenaries\u201d and claimed their attacks on SDF positions were \u201crepelled.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish news service Rudaw reported on Tuesday that a Russian military police patrol near Darbasiya was nearly hit by suspected Turkish artillery fire.\n\nThe Russians said reports of the near-miss have \u201cnothing to do with reality\u201d and there were \u201cno casualties among the Russian personnel.\u201d According to a Russian spokesman, the explosion Rudaw reported was caused by \u201can unidentified caseless explosive device\u201d detonating near an armored vehicle.", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declares victory as Kurdish forces withdraw from the \"safe zone\" along the Turkey-Syria border.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178977580-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
