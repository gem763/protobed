State and local government austerity since the recession has contributed to a significant shortfall in education employment. There are still 60,000 fewer public education jobs than there were before the recession began in 2007. If we include the number of jobs that should have been created just to keep up with growing student enrollment, we are currently experiencing a 307,000 job shortfall in public education.\n\nThe

My colleagues Sylvia Allegretto and Larry Mishel find that average weekly wages of public school teachers have fallen over the last two decades and the teacher wage penalty continues to grow, reaching a record 21.4% in 2018. My colleagues Emma Garc\u00eda and Elaine Weiss have further documented shortcomings and teacher shortages and recently how much teachers have to pay out of their own pockets for school supplies for their classrooms. Low pay makes it harder to attract and retain teachers who have the qualifications associated with teacher effectiveness in the classroom.\n\nThe costs of a significant teacher employment gap are high, and consequences measurable: larger class sizes, fewer teacher aides, fewer extracurricular activities, and changes to curricula. To solve this problem, state and local governments need to fund more teaching positions and raise pay to close the teacher pay gap and attract and retain the qualified teachers our children deserve.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.epi.org/wp-content/themes/epi/img/logos/epi-acronym-square-red-400.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
