How will they fare against sneaky Russian bots?\n\nCarried out in the summer of 2018 by a team of NATO experts, the cyber experiment involved using a bogus website and a fake Tinder profile to glean sensitive information from unsuspecting troops.\n\nNATO troops used the phony site, marketed as a portal for people serving in the military, to chat about the army and life in general, according to German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. A few even ordered clothing on a fake e-shop, handing over their home addresses for delivery.\n\nSoldiers looking for some Latvian love while stationed abroad were similarly swindled. On Tinder, the popular dating app, numerous soldiers exchanged flirtatious messages with a fictitious woman, the cruel creation of the NATO cyber experts. Two infantrymen even reportedly agreed to meet with the imaginary lady.\n\nWhile the story might seem humorous at first glance, there\u2019s nothing funny about being catfished by your own defensive alliance, or so we\u2019re told. In fact, according to NATO\u2019s Center for Strategic Communication, located in Riga, Latvia, the test revealed that the alliance must do more to protect its naive troops from\u2026 Russia.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Russia has invaded Estonia, NATO is on the way\u2019: German TV plumbs depths with fake war broadcast\n\nNATO has repeatedly accused Moscow of spreading fake news and disinformation across the globe.
