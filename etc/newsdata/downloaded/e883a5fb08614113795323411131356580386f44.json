It uses a submarine to covertly approach the target and launch an attack. It's dangerous. So by firing this missile, North Korea seems to be resorting to shock tactics to convey that the regime is fully capable of deploying such destructive weapon,\u201d Moon Sung-muk, Researcher at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, told ABC News.\n\nThe U.S. State Department in a statement called on North Korea \"to refrain from provocations, abide by their obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions, and remain engaged in substantive and sustained negotiations to do their part to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and achieve denuclearization.\"\n\nAnalysts in Seoul say there may be multiple reasons why North Korean leader Kim Jong Un continues provocative actions while suggesting working-level talks with the United States to discuss denulearization this Saturday.\n\n\u201cNorth's position stipulates that the negotiations with the U.S. are not \"unilateral negotiations regarding denuclearization\" but \"negotiations on arms reduction with the U.S.\" By demonstrating such a missile capability system, North Korea aims to lead the U.S.-North Korea negotiations in the direction to reduce mutual arms instead of a one-sided negotiation,\u201d Woo Jung-yeop, Head of the Center for American Studies at Seoul-based Sejong Institute, told ABC News.\n\nThis is North Korea\u2019s 11th missile launch this year alone.\n\nABC News\u2019 Hakyung Kate Lee, Hansol Park and Kapkoo Kwon contributed to this report.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
