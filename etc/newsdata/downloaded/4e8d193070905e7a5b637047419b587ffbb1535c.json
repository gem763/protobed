He now lives in Surrey with wife Rosie Ries, 61.\n\nIn the frame: John Virgo says taxes must go up for high earners\n\nWhat did your parents teach you about money?\n\nTo respect it, because we didn\u2019t have a lot of it. I grew up on a street that\u2019s similar to the ones you used to see in Coronation Street on TV.\n\nWe had an outside toilet at the bottom of the yard and I had to share a bedroom until my older sisters left home. When you are brought up like that, you realise that money\u2019s tight.\n\nMy mother was a housewife and my father was a train driver on the Salford docks earning \u00a39 and ten shillings [\u00a39.50] a week. He had a family of seven to keep on that. If they handed out medals for looking out for your family, he would have got one.\n\nWhat was your first job?\n\nWorking in the invoice department of a steelworks company in Manchester for \u00a33.50 a week. I would run up and down the stairs delivering invoices. I gave \u00a33 to my mother and kept 50p for myself. I never sat any exams at school. Our family situation meant that as soon as I was able to go out and get a job, I got one.\n\nBut I used to play in the snooker clubs for half a crown and supplement my income that way. I started playing when I was 12. Within a year of leaving school, I was the boys\u2019 champion of Great Britain in the under-16 category.\n\nHave you ever struggled to make ends meet?\n\nYes, on many occasions. The worst time was in 1985 when house prices crashed and interest rates went up to 14 per cent. I was not winning on the snooker table and I had this big image to keep up \u2013 and a lifestyle where I lived beyond my means. It\u2019s easy to do that.\n\nI got into a terrible state financially. I remortgaged and remortgaged, but eventually my home \u2013 a three-bedroom detached house in Surrey \u2013 was repossessed and I handed the keys back to the mortgage lender. If I had hung on to it, that house would now probably be worth three-quarters of a million pounds. It was stressful and my wife at the time and I split up.\n\nJohn Virgo Playing in 1990\n\nDid you ever get a \u2018big break\u2019?\n\nYes. About a year after my house was repossessed, just when I felt I was getting towards the end of my career. I signed up with a new management team. I then got a phone call from the BBC asking me to get involved with a television series starring Jim Davidson. It was just sheer luck. Then again people say you have got to take advantage of luck when you get it \u2013 and that\u2019s true.\n\nWe were commissioned to do six programmes and we finished up doing nearly 200. At one point, nearly 14 million people would watch Big Break on a Saturday night. It was unbelievable and great fun to do.\n\nHave you ever been paid silly money?\n\nYes. In the 1990s, a haulage company once paid me and Jim Davidson \u00a36,000 to drive around a truck festival in a wagon for a couple of hours.\n\nWhat was the best year of your financial life?\n\nI can't recall which particular year, but it would have been in the late 1990s or early 2000s. I was doing 30-odd shows a year of Big Break, plus Jim and I started doing pantomime.\n\nUnfortunately, I was also going through a messy divorce, so a lot of the money I was making was coming in one end and going out the other.\n\nBut I stopped struggling for the first time in my life. I was not a multi-millionaire by any means, but I did not have to worry about the pennies.\n\nWhat is the most expensive object you have been given?\n\nIt was a Cartier Tank watch worth about \u00a310,000. Jim Davidson gave it to me as a gift after the second series of Big Break.\n\nIt was something I always wanted to buy and Jim knew that. When he gave it to me, he said thanks for resurrecting his career. He knew nothing about snooker when he started the show.\n\nThe best money decision you have made?\n\nBuying my two-bedroom maisonette in Shepperton, Surrey, in the late 1970s. I eventually sold it for double what I paid for it.\n\nDo you save into a pension and invest in the stock market?\n\nI used to save into a pension. I started saving when I was nearly in my 40s. I wasn\u2019t in a position to do so before. I have never invested directly in stocks and shares. That\u2019s never been my type of speculation.\n\nDo you own any property?\n\nYes, my home. It\u2019s a beautiful four-bedroom detached house in Surrey. It belonged to my wife when we got together ten years ago and we both own it now.\n\n'I would increase taxes on the highest earners to help pay for the police, the NHS and the education system', says Virgo\n\nWhat little luxury do you treat yourself to?\n\nOccasionally, a nice lunch somewhere in Surrey. We typically spend at least \u00a350 each. In my opinion, you can\u2019t get away without spending that much when you eat out. I don\u2019t know how young people survive today.\n\nIf you were Chancellor what would you do?\n\nI would increase taxes on the highest earners to help pay for the police, the NHS and the education system. I\u2019m not in favour of increasing taxes for people who are just struggling to earn a living, just people at the top end.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t the Government make more effort to get big companies to pay more tax? It\u2019s scary at the moment when you read about crime figures, food banks and poverty. The NHS is just being driven into the ground.\n\nIf increasing taxes on the highest earners is the only way to provide the services people are entitled to have, they should do that, without a doubt.\n\nDo you donate money to charity?\n\nYes, I support the Alexander Devine Children\u2019s Hospice, based in Maidenhead, Berkshire. I think children who are terminally ill deserve a bit of dignity at the end of their short lives.\n\nWhat is your number one financial priority?\n\nTo keep my head above water and live within my means, as my parents taught me to.", "description": "Former snooker champion John Virgo would put up taxes for higher earners if he was made Chancellor of the Exchequer.", "authors": ["Donna Ferguson For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
