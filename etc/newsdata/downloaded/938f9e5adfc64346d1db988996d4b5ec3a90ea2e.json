(Dennis Demcheck/U.S. Geological Survey)\n\nSome people can\u2019t sleep if they know there\u2019s a spider in their house. Imagine being in Beaumont, Tex., and thinking that the largest alligator ever caught in the United States was on the loose there.\n\nFortunately, after a nerve-racking few days, that gator has been found.\n\nIt was a tense week for neighbors of Gator Country, the \u201clargest alligator adventure park/sanctuary in Southeast Texas.\u201d The Beaumont facility, hard hit by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, found itself inundated by floodwaters again as the remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda dumped 43 inches of rain in the area.\n\n[Climate change more than doubled the odds of Houston\u2019s most recent deluge, study finds]\n\nWhen the water finally started to recede Wednesday into Thursday, Big Tex \u2014 a 14-foot, 1,000-pound behemoth \u2014 was missing, along with roughly three dozen other gators. Adjacent neighborhoods went to sleep at night knowing the nation\u2019s largest alligator in captivity could be lurking nearby.\n\nWhen there\u2019s an alligator on the loose, whom do you call? Jon Warner.\n\nWarner runs the alligator program for Texas Parks and Wildlife. A Midwest native, Warner holds a PhD he earned for studying in Africa about how alligators can serve as indicators of an ecosystem\u2019s health. For the past several days, he has been keeping tabs on Big Tex.\n\n\u201cWe were unsure he had even escaped,\u201d Warner said. \u201cBut when the water level went down, Big Tex wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Warner said that if the gator had left the premises, \u201che\u2019d probably stay in the immediate vicinity.\u201d On Friday afternoon, Big Tex was found near a pond on the 15-acre sanctuary\u2019s property.\n\nGator Country confirmed he had been located early Friday afternoon and was \u201cbeing moved back.\u201d\n\nA number of small alligators are still missing, but those are \u201cmostly just three-, four- and five-footers,\u201d Warner said. \u201cThey probably just swam over the fence.\u201d\n\nWarner said Gator Country is at \u201c80 percent capacity\u201d in locating the reptiles that were initially reported missing after Imelda\u2019s drenching.\n\nIn the wake of major storms, it\u2019s not unusual for animals to wind up in places they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be. When Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in 2017, about 50 gators were captured after springing loose from Gator Country, the Beaumont Enterprise reported. Flooding had caused the water to rise above the four-foot fences.\n\nIn a separate incident, deputies had to wrangle one gator out of a house. A photo showed the animal lounging on a rug.\n\nImelda drew plenty of comparisons to Harvey as it walloped some of the same areas with severe flooding that stranded residents and triggered thousands of calls for help. The storm is blamed for at least five deaths, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIt was hard on the animals, too: The Texas A&M Veterinary Emergency Team spent days rescuing cattle and horses, according to the Houston Chronicle. Meanwhile, Houston\u2019s Fox 26 reported, officials at the Harris County Animal Shelter are urging the public to consider taking in animals to make room for others that were affected by the storm.\n\n[Hurricane Lorenzo packs Category 4 winds \u2014 and presents an ominous climate signal]\n\nThe search for Big Tex came during the height of Texas\u2019s alligator-hunting season, which runs from Sept. 10 through Sept. 30. \u201cEveryone has to have special permits to hunt them,\u201d Warner said. Texas harvests the third-highest number of alligators in the nation, behind only Florida and Louisiana. \u201cIt helps with population management,\u201d he added.\n\nWarner has been in his job since 2017. He says his office gets about 1,000 calls for \u201cnuisance alligators\u201d every year. The office works with about 70 specially licensed professionals across the Lone Star State who are trained to capture and, if necessary, relocate wandering alligators. \u201cA number of the staff\u201d at Gator Country are among those trained, he said.\n\nGator Country opened to the public in 2005. Owner Gary Saurage told weather.com the water was waist-high late last week. Saurage, who has a home on the property, appeared in a video posted on Facebook on Sept. 21 and told the park\u2019s followers he didn\u2019t yet know how the animals were faring.\n\nYou\u2019ve been waiting...Gator Country update Posted by Shannon Saurage on Saturday, September 21, 2019\n\n\u201cThe water just won\u2019t leave,\u201d Saurage, an alligator trapper for the state of Texas, said, then added: \u201cSoutheast Texas, we love you. Stay strong; we\u2019re fighting a battle here. This is the hardest battle I\u2019ve ever fought in my life.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 23, Saurage returned to Facebook to report Big Al, a gator who previously held Big Tex\u2019s record, was safe and sound in his enclosure at the park. Now Big Tex\u2019s story has a happy ending, as well.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe creator of the labradoodle says he made \u2018Frankenstein\u2019s monster\u2019\n\nNorth America has lost 3 billion birds in 50 years\n\nWild horses have long kicked up controversy.
