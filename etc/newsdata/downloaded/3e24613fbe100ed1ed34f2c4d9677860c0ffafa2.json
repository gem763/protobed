No military combat, anything. Anything. That\u2019s why he cannot produce a picture of himself in uniform in Afghanistan. There\u2019s one picture of him in full military garb, but I checked into it. It\u2019s taken at the airport in South Bend so it\u2019s fake military experience.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg subsequently responded to the attack on Twitter later Wednesday.\n\n\u201cEverything about my experience in the military was abundantly real, from the boredom to the danger,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg tweeted. \u201cNow shall we talk about Donald Trump\u2019s experiences with military service?\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg, 37, enlisted in the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2009. He started his first term as mayor in 2012, and he took a seven-month leave in 2014 to deploy to Afghanistan, where he served on a counterterrorism unit. He was reelected to a second term in 2015 launched his presidential campaign this past January.\n\nMr. Trump has not served in the military.\n\nThe results of several recent polls have placed Mr. Buttigieg among the top five candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Mr. Trump in 2020, including an Iowa State University poll released Thursday that listed him in second place, trailing Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, and leading former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nMr. Buttigieg is not the only current presidential candidate with military experiences overseas. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii Democrat and fellow White House hopeful, has served in the U.S. Army, including during the second Iraq War, and remains a member of the Hawaii Army National Guard.\n\nMr. Simone\u2019s remarks were first reported by Media Matters for America.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
