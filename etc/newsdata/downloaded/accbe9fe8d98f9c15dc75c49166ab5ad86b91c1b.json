IOOF has said the case, which is ongoing, is without foundation.\n\nIOOF recently won a separate case brought by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to disqualify five top IOOF executives for failing to act in customers\u2019 interests by breaching pension laws.\n\nChief Executive Christopher Kelaher left the company by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d in July amid the restructure.", "description": "Australia's financial regulator said on Monday it has imposed additional license conditions on the investment services unit of wealth manager IOOF Holdings Ltd .", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
