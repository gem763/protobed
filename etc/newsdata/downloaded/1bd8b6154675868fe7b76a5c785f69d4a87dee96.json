Add Interest\n\nJohnson plans to kick things off by asking for a \"straight up-and-down vote\" on the EU divorce agreement on Monday, two days after lawmakers voted to delay approving the deal, according to his office.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow could refuse to allow such a vote because parliamentary rules generally bar the same measure from being considered a second time during the same session of Parliament unless something has changed.\n\nJohnson's Conservative government will also introduce the legislation necessary to implement the Brexit agreement, opening the door to potentially lengthy debates or amendments that could scuttle the deal.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
