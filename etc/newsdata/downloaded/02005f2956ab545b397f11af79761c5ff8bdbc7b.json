The vehicle maker has already been active in putting autonomous technology to work in these industries, with self-driving projects including at a few quarries and mines, and in the busy port located at Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nThe company sees demand for this kind of autonomous technology use growing, and decided to establish an entire business unit to address it. The newly-formed group will be called Volvo Autonomous Solutions, and its official mission is to \u201caccelerate the development, commercialization and sales of autonomous transport solutions,\u201d focused on the kind of transportation \u201cwhere there is a need to move large volumes of goods and material on pre-defeined routes, in receptive flows.\u201d\n\nTheir anticipation of the growth of this sector comes in part from direct customer feedback, the automaker notes. It\u2019s seen \u201csignificant increase in inquires from customers,\u201d according to a statement from Martin Lundstedt, Volvo Group\u2019s President and CEO.\n\nOfficially, Volvo Autonomous Solutions won\u2019t be a formal new business area under its parent company until January 2020, but the company is looking for a new head of the unit already, and it\u2019s clear they see a lot of potential in this bourgeoning market.\n\nUnlike autonomous driving for consumer automobiles, this kind of self-driving for fixed route goods transportation is a nice match to the capabilities of technology as they exist today. These industrial applications eliminate a lot of the chaos and complexity of driving in, say, urban environments and with a lot of other human-driven vehicles on the road, and their routes are predictable and repeatable.", "description": "Volvo Group has established a new dedicated business group focused on autonomous transportation, with a mandate that covers industry segments like mining, ports and moving goods between logistics hubs of all kinds.
