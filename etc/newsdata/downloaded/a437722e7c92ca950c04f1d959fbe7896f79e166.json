This time around, though, the rope was gone, likely having been swept away by the mighty waters \u2013 leaving the Whitsons and Ramirez, 34, marooned without \u201ca single soul\u201d in sight, Hunter said in a recent interview with the Post.\n\nGEORGIA DAD, DAUGHTER CATCH 14-FOOT, 700-POUND 'MONSTER' ALLIGATOR: 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT'\n\nCurtis had packed a rope for the trip, but he believed that the water was \u201ctoo swift and high\u201d to try to attach it and rappel down.\n\nThough friends knew that the Morro Bay family was adventuring in the Arroyo Seco, the campers had no cell service and no easy way out.\n\nBy a stroke of inspiration, working with what he had, the dad carved \u201cHELP!\u201d twice onto his lime-green Nalgene bottle, tucked a dated SOS note inside, and tossed the vessel down the powerful waterfall in hopes that it would be found.\n\n\u201cIt was a little scary,\u201d recalled Hunter, a high school freshman. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen a single soul the entire trip.\u201d\n\nHiking upstream and creating an SOS sign with rocks, the campers went to bed in their sleeping bags, knowing that they could do nothing but wait, said the Post.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nTo their shock, around midnight, they awoke to a loud message from a speaker overhead:\n\n\u201cThis is search and rescue \u2014 you have been found! Stay put and we\u2019ll be back to get you tomorrow morning,\u201d a message from a California Highway Patrol (CHP) helicopter piloted by Todd Brethour thundered.\n\nBefore the end of their shift, Brethour and his crew did a flyover in the area and, using their night-vision goggles and infrared technology to spot their campfire, found the stranded campers.\n\nThough it was too dark to make the rescue, a second CHP helicopter came back at 10 a.m. the next morning to lift the Whitsons and Ramirez to safety.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine, they were very happy to see us,\u201d pilot Joe Kingman remembered. \u201cA lot of pieces fell into place just right for these folks.\u201d\n\nLater on, the campers learned that two hikers found the bottle about a quarter-mile downstream and notified the management of the Arroyo Seco Campground to send a rescue team straightaway.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKingman added that in his 23 years of rescue missions, he had never heard of people being saved through a message in a bottle.\n\n\u201cIt blows me away how it all came perfectly together,\u201d Curtis mused to the Post. \u201cWhat are the odds?\u201d\n\nMoving forward, the family hopes to connect with the two hikers who found the lime green bottle and properly thank them, a spokesperson on behalf of Nalgene told Fox News.\n\nCHP officials were not immediately available to offer further comment.", "description": "The California trio is feeling thankful to be home safe.", "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.
