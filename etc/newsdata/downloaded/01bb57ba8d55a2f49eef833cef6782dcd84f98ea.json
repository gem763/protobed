It basically replicated the function of the home button on the iPhone or iPad, where pressing it brings you immediately back home instead of needing to press a \"back\" button repeatedly.\n\nYesterday, though, I noticed that pressing the TV button once wouldn't bring me to the home screen; it would bring me to Apple's TV app, where the new TV Plus service will live starting in November.\n\nRead more: Apple used helicopters and drones to film stunning 4K screensavers for the Apple TV \u2014 here's how to get them on your computer\n\nWe reached out to Apple to get some more details and clarification on this change, but didn't immediately hear back.\n\nThankfully, there is a simple solution. Just go to the Settings app, click Remotes and Devices, and click the Home Button. It will toggle the remote's home button back to its original setting.", "description": "Apple tweaked one of the most important buttons on the Apple TV remote control, seemingly overnight, but there's a way to revert your settings.", "authors": ["Dave Smith"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8a24882e22af395f16d323-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
