A film passes the Bechdel Test if: 1. The film has at least two female characters 2. Those characters talk to each other 3. Their conversation is not related to the male characters\n\nThey were also pictured with furniture and inside the home 28 per cent more of the time.\n\nProfessor Lee said, 'Our research confirmed that many commercial films depict women from a stereotypical perspective.\n\n'I hope this result promotes public awareness of the importance of taking prudence when filmmakers create characters in films.'\n\nEngineer Byungjoo Lee of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and colleagues believe they have created a method more effective at measuring equality in films than the traditional Bechdel Test.\n\nUsing facial recognition software the researchers analysed 40 Hollywood films\n\nUsing the new system, the team computed eight quantitative indicators that describe the representation of a particular gender in the films.\n\nThey are: emotional diversity, how much they move, how much of the screen they take up, how long they stay on screen, mean age, intellectual image, emphasis on appearance, and type and frequency of surrounding objects.\n\nEngineer Byungjoo Lee found the system they created to more accurately and practically evaluate the degree to which female and male characters are discriminatingly depicted in a film in quantitative terms.\n\nThe team believe the Bechdel Test has fundamental limitations regarding the accuracy and practicality of the evaluation.\n\nFirstly, the Bechdel Test requires considerable human resources, as it is performed subjectively by a person who must watch the entire film.\n\nMore importantly, the Bechdel Test analyses only a single aspect of the film, the dialogues between characters in the script.\n\nThe research team believe it does not 'fully represent today\u2019s various discourse on gender bias, which is much more diverse than in 1985 when the Bechdel Test was first presented'.\n\nThe full findings of the study will be presented at the 22nd Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, which will be held in Austin, Texas from November 9\u201313.", "description": "A research team from\u00a0KAIST University in South Korea found that\u00a0female characters appeared less frequently than males at the rate of 56%.
