But Johnson says he's not afraid to prorogue Parliament all over again.\n\nDoughty spoke to As it Happens host Carol Off about the court ruling and what comes next. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nJust how extraordinary is this ruling from your Supreme Court?\n\nIt is a truly momentous decision. And the clarity by which it was given, the fact it was unanimous, and the absolutely devastating verdict for the prime minister is something certainly that hasn't been seen, I think, in the last 100 years.\n\nWhat people were looking for in the Supreme Court ruling was whether or not they would say what others had \u2014 that Boris Johnson had lied to the Queen. They didn't say that. So what do you make of that?\n\nHe clearly did, because ... they upheld the judgment of the Scottish court, which was very clear about that.\n\nThe fact is that, you know, he has dragged the monarch into one of the greatest constitutional crises in British history.\n\nBoris Johnson wants to make this all about Brexit. But by gagging Parliament \u2014 as it would be with Parliament in Canada \u2014 you are preventing Parliament from doing its job on so many other issues.\n\nWe were due to debate a bill on domestic violence. We were supposed to be talking about climate change, health care, education, pensions \u2014 so many issues. And those were prevented from taking place.\n\nDoughty says Johnson should resign. (Submitted by Stephen Doughty )\n\nBut that's what Prime Minister Johnson said that he was preparing for \u2014 he was proroguing in order to get his ducks in order for a Queen's Speech. And now he says that's what he is going to do, right? Is that what's going to happen next?\n\nWhat's going to happen next is that Parliament will return [Wednesday] because essentially the justices made very clear that the decision was null and void. The session of Parliament has not ended. We are still in session, and therefore we're going to carry on with our business as normal.\n\nWe will all be wanting to ask what on Earth has Boris Johnson been doing with these so-called negotiations? We've seen very little evidence of anything yet. And my fear is he still intends to push us out with a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThis is a man who simply thinks one rule applies for him and one rule applies for everybody else. And he's got a history \u2014 and I don't use these words very often \u2014 of lying.\n\nHe was fired from a job at a newspaper for making up stories, and he's got a history of this.\n\nHe needs to resign. He clearly is not a fit and proper person to be holding the office of prime minister.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party, wants Brits to vote in a new Brexit referendum. (Kirsty Wigglesworth/The Associated Press)\n\nIs Parliament frustrating his agenda? I mean, are you looking toward the possibility of entering an election? Is Labour doing that?\n\nWell, an election may well come, and [Labour Leader] Jeremy Corbyn has just been making a speech to the Labour Convention about this, that we obviously want to have an election to get this Conservative government out of office.\n\nBut of course, you know, there are many, many things which need to happen over the days and weeks to come. And, you know, if Boris Johnson does come back with a deal, or Parliament decides to put a deal on the table, I think there's a better way of resolving this \u2014 which is putting a deal back to the public in a referendum, and actually taking the issue of Brexit away from an election.\n\nWill your party try to force a vote of no confidence?\n\nThat would normally be what you'd expect to happen. But there is a trap here that has been laid by Boris Johnson \u2014 which is that if we were to have an election before, we'll be in an election process before the extension to the Brexit process had been secured and granted by the European Union. Then he ... could crash us out during that process with no deal.\n\n\n\nMost MPs see right through this, from all the parties, including many in his own, or at least the ones he's thrown out. And people are not going to fall for a trick by which we end in a situation of a no-deal Brexit, which would be a disaster for the U.K.\n\nAnd I think all of us in Parliament \u2014 whatever our views on how you resolve Brexit; fundamentally, I would like to stay in the European Union \u2014 want to see a situation where it's the British people who have a final say on a deal to leave.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday. (Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\n\nYou've just declared yourself as a Remainer. Don't you think it's incumbent on Jeremy Corbyn to declare what he thinks of Brexit, how he would vote, how he would campaign in a referendum, if he wants to actually be the prime minister?\n\nHe's been very, very clear about absolutely ruling out a no-deal Brexit, absolutely ruling out a deal that's brought by Boris Johnson, and absolutely ruling in having a final say opportunity for the public to vote on this in a second referendum. And I think that's absolutely right.\n\nBut as I said, we may find ourselves in situations in the days to come where that is a moot point because we have a deal on the table, or we need to decide what to do about that and whether it should proceed.\n\nBut your party has succeeded in passing a law that would supposedly prevent the United Kingdom from crashing out without a deal. Boris Johnson says that you're going to leave the EU on Oct. 31, with or without. So is there something Boris Johnson knows that you don't?\n\n[Former prime minister] Theresa May claimed we were going to leave in March and April. And Boris Johnson has claimed all sorts of things in his life which are proven not to be true \u2014 because, as I said, the man is a categorical liar.\n\nHe can carry on with all the bluff and bluster he wants. The fact is the law of the land is that unless he secures a deal through Parliament, he must request an extension. And therefore, Brexit will not take place on the 31st of October.\n\nIf he wants to have another run in with the Supreme Court, he's very welcome to try. But given his behaviour over the last few weeks, and given the judgment \u2014 the unanimous judgment \u2014 of the judges today, I think that would be a very unwise course for him to take.\n\nWe are all united that we want to stop a disastrous no-deal, and that's why that legislation was passed. And the prime minister needs to stop attacking the judges, stop attacking Parliament, and actually realize that he's not above the law and that he needs to comply with it.\n\nInterview produced by Jeanne Armstrong.
