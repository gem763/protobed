He was, after all, \u00advice-captain at the time.\n\nAnd to hear him question whether he had fallen short at the time of the moral \u00adcourage to have said, \u2018I\u2019m not wearing that,\u2019 was an \u00adinteresting \u00adinsight into the problem and the man himself.\n\nIt was Evra\u2019s old team-mate Rio Ferdinand who then called for \u00adLiverpool to act upon Carragher\u2019s lead, and make the gesture of a formal apology.\n\nIt is a good idea.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Sky Sports)\n\nLiverpool were in the wrong.\n\nAfter a lengthy hearing, an independent body had found Suarez guilty. The Reds\u2019 team then wore, en masse, T-shirts in support of their team-mate.\n\nSolidarity with a man found guilty of \u00adracism? What part of that is right?\n\nNone of it. It wasn\u2019t right then and the passing of time hasn\u2019t altered that.\n\nSo, what would the club apologise for, exactly? Those T-shirts, \u00adpresumably. But how can you issue a press release over the wearing of those garments?\n\nYou can\u2019t \u2013 not really.\n\n(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBut Liverpool\u2019s chief executive Peter Moore could seek out Evra, apologise on behalf of the club, saying they made an error of judgement, and offer a sizable donation to a charity of the player\u2019s choice.\n\nA press release could be issued on that basis. Moral justice would be served and the club could move on.\n\nAs a symbolic gesture, it would have a huge impact. And that\u2019s important.\n\nFirstly, because as fellow Sunday People \u00adcolumnist Stan Collymore so \u00adeloquently pointed out last week, \u00adracism isn\u2019t going away.\n\nRace-hate crimes are on the \u00adincrease.\n\nIn the past couple of weeks there have been issues during England\u2019s match in Bulgaria and then, much closer to home, at the fixture \u00adinvolving Haringey Borough and Yeovil.\n\nSecondly, it is important \u00adbecause Liverpool clearly champion a zero-tolerance \u00adapproach towards racism, as was demonstrated this week.\n\nAn offensive Reds banner was hung from the stands at the Champions League tie against Genk. If you missed it, it was \u2018WhatsApp Guy\u2019 \u2013 an image of a naked bloke that\u2019s done the rounds on social media \u2013 but with Divock Origi\u2019s head super-\u00adimposed.\n\nI think it was supposed to be funny. But no laughing matter if you are \u00adtrying to tackle racist stereotypes.\n\nThe poster was condemned by \u00adLiverpool even before the end of the tie. The PR machine was in over-drive inside 80 minutes, not eight years.\n\nBut lastly, an apology to Evra would matter because Liverpool is one of the most successful and influential \u00adfootball clubs in the country.\n\nSorry is the hardest word. But big, successful, influential clubs play a huge role in writing the world\u2019s story. It\u2019s a word that should be said.", "description": "Liverpool backed Luis Suarez after he had been found guilty of racially abusing Man Utd defender Patrice Evra in 2011", "authors": ["Neil Moxley", "Image", "Craig Brough Action Images", "Afp Getty Images", "Sky Sports", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article5243622.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Liverpool-Suarez.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
