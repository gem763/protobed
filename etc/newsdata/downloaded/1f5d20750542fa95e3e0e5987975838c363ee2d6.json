Enjoy it now before the next round begins the following week and the pressure intensifies.\n\nFEW WORRIES INDEED\n\nDenny Hamlin is 56 points ahead of Alex Bowman, the first driver outside a transfer spot to the next round. It would take quite a series of circumstances for Hamlin not to advance to the next round.\n\nSEE YOU DOWN THE ROAD\n\nHamlin\u2019s Joe Gibbs Racing teammates, Martin Truex Jr. and Kyle Busch, also are in a good spot to advance to the Round of 8. Truex is 48 points ahead of Bowman and Busch is 41 points ahead of Bowman.\n\nDON\u2019T FORGET ABOUT ME\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Kevin Harvick didn\u2019t have a memorable Talladega \u2014 few playoff drivers did \u2014 his 17th-place finish left him 36 points ahead of Bowman. Harvick also should be in good shape to advance provided nothing catastrophic happens to his car at Kansas.\n\nJUST AVOID TROUBLE\n\nTeam Penske teammates Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano hold the final two transfer spots entering this weekend. Keselowski is 20 points ahead of Bowman. Logano is 18 points ahead of Bowman. Keselowski won at Kansas in May.\n\n\u201cBrad and I are l looking OK,\u201d Logano told NBC Sports after the race. \u201cIt\u2019s better than being 18 behind. We\u2019ve just got to be smart (at Kansas) \u2026 and no crashing.\u201d\n\nNO HOLDING BACK\n\nBowman, Chase Elliott, Clint Bowyer and William Byron are the four drivers outside a transfer spot heading to Kansas.\n\nBowman trails Logano, who holds the final transfer spot by 18 points. Elliott trails Logano by 22 points. Bowyer is 24 points behind Logano. Byron trails Logano by 27 points.\n\nAll can get in via points but realistically, it\u2019s going to take a win.\n\n\u201cI think we need to go and try to win,\u201d Elliott said after Monday\u2019s race at Talladega Superspeedway.\n\nPOINTS STANDINGS\n\n3114 \u2014 Denny Hamlin\n\n3106 \u2014 Martin Truex Jr.\n\n3099 \u2014 Kyle Busch\n\n3094 \u2014 Kevin Harvick\n\n3078 \u2014 Brad Keselowski\n\n3076 \u2014 Joey Logano\n\n3069 \u2014 Kyle Larson (Dover win moves him to next round)\n\n*3058 \u2014 Alex Bowman\n\n3056 \u2014 Ryan Blaney (Talladega win moves him to next round)\n\n*3054 \u2014 Chase Elliott\n\n*3052 \u2014 Clint Bowyer\n\n*3049 \u2014 William Byron\n\n* Outside a transfer spot to the Round of 8", "description": "Ryan Blaney's win dramatically altered the playoff picture entering this weekend's elimination race.", "authors": ["Dustin Long"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/U4h.D_RMxUfulWxQHaDiLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjAuMzI5MjE4MTA2OTk1OQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5YxFCcL5Ldod86cyy1r9cA--~B/aD01NDc7dz05NzI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/c8b4b148e9df5ed4615ed72f3fbed4b4", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
