Bolsonaro has been accused of allowing an increase in illegal occupation of Amazonian lands and deforestation.\n\nA representative of the Bolsonaro administration was at the Vatican for the summit and denied that there was an environmental crisis in the Amazon.\n\n\u201cThere is no justification for talking about an environmental crisis in Brazil,\u201d said F\u00e1bio Mendes Marzano, secretary of national sovereignty and citizenship affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in opposition to the assessment made at the synod.\n\nAs some observers have suggested, the 2019 Amazon synod involved \u201ca group of participants carefully selected to produce a certain result.\u201d\n\nAttending Monday\u2019s summit were 3 ministers and 30 governors of the Brazilian Amazon as well as from the Amazonian regions of Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Venezuela, Guyana, and Suriname, along with representatives of the Catholic Church, and the American biologist Thomas Lovejoy.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Regional leaders from the Amazon proposed at the Vatican that rich nations be compelled to indemnify them for environmental damage.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
