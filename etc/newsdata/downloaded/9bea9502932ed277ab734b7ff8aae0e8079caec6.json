They\u2019re stereotypically sullen, they talk back and they\u2019re embarrassed by our very existence. Not always, of course, but parents can find their relationship with their child strained during the teenage years. And it\u2019s not necessarily the kid\u2019s fault.\n\nChild and family psychologist Barbara Greenberg says it might actually be us, the parents, who are doing more damage to our relationship with our teenagers than they are. We\u2019re trying too hard in some areas and not hard enough in others.\n\nDon\u2019t act cool\n\nOne of the biggest cringe-worthy ways a parent can negatively impact their relationship with their teenage child is by trying to act too cool, Greenberg says. That includes, but is not limited to:\n\nDressing like your kids or in attire that is inappropriate\n\nUsing their vernacular (please don\u2019t study and then attempt to use their slang)\n\nAttempting to gossip with them about their friends or drama at school\n\nBlasting (and dancing to!) their favourite music when they have friends over\n\n\u201cParents want their kids to like them and they want their kid\u2019s friends to like them,\u201d Greenberg says. \u201cBut the way to get them to like you is not by acting cool. Kids do not want you to act like a friend; they\u2019re uncomfortable with that. They want you to act like a parent.\u201d\n\nKeep their secrets\n\nIf your teenage child confides something in you, you need to keep it to yourself. You might think it\u2019s so cute that Emma has a crush, but when you gush about it on the phone to your sister or your best friend, it will sound like you\u2019re making light of something that is sacred to her.\n\n\u201cIt really erodes the trust,\u201d Greenberg says. \u201cIt sort of makes them feel like they\u2019re not that important or that their secrets are a source of entertainment.\u201d\n\nOther examples might be a daughter confiding in her mother that she got her first period, something embarrassing that happened at school, or a conflict they are having with another friend. Take their trust in you seriously and, as long as no one is at risk for harm, keep it to yourself.\n\nDon\u2019t compare them to their friends\n\n\u201cParents do this constantly,\u201d Greenberg says. \u201c\u2018Why can\u2019t you be more like so-and-so; she\u2019s so nice to her mother, or she gets good grades.\u2019 It\u2019s usually about grades.\u201d\n\nAsking kids why they can\u2019t be more like a friend doesn\u2019t magically motivate them to study harder or change their attitude at home. All it does, Greenberg says, is make them 1. feel inadequate and 2. turn them against that friend, whom they now see as a competitor. Focus instead on celebrating your own kid\u2019s strengths.\n\nStop interrupting\n\nYou are full of sage advice! You, too, have been a teenager and you know what they are going through! Except no, you don\u2019t, because being a teenager now is much different than being a pre-smartphone-era teenager. And interrupting them doesn\u2019t make them listen to you more closely anyway; it makes them tune you out.\n\nIt\u2019s more important to listen to your kids than to be heard. They need to know that their words and feelings are important to you and interruption gives the opposite message \u2014 that what they\u2019re saying isn\u2019t important enough to listen to.\n\nAnd while you\u2019re busy listening, Greenberg says, be careful to keep your own mood in check. Showing that your mood is contingent upon how your teen is treating you can actually be damaging to the relationship.\n\n\u201cKids aren\u2019t going to open up to you if you act like you can\u2019t tolerate what they\u2019re going to tell you,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a tough one but it\u2019s an important one.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be critical about little things\n\nSure, you have to set some limits on what they can or cannot wear. But whenever possible, let go of stuff like wardrobe and hair style. You might think that outfit doesn\u2019t even remotely match or they look so much better with their hair pulled back, but keep it to yourself.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more important is the quality of the relationship,\u201d Greenberg says. \u201cAbove all else, preserve that. Before you say something like, \u2018Those pants are too tight,\u2019 ask yourself if it is really necessary and if it\u2019s going to help the relationship.\u201d", "description": "Whether fair or not, teenagers have somewhat of a bad rap.
