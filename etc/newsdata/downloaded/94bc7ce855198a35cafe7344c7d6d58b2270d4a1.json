Under the proposed plan, House committees would continue to pursue probes of those issues.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi offered the suggestion during a leadership meeting on Wednesday morning, according to two people who attended the meeting, adding that national security should be a key focus.\n\n\u201cThis has clarity and understanding in the eyes of the American people,\u201d Pelosi told her leadership team, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting. \u201cIf we do articles, then we can include other things.\u201d\n\nAlthough there is no explicit deadline to act and no decisions have been made, some Democrats said they were hopeful articles of impeachment could be considered by the end of the year or even sooner.\n\n\u201cI think focusing on this Ukrainian scandal singularly is important,\u201d said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) \u201cI think we have to act quickly. But not with haste.\u201d\n\nRep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said the caucus has unified around the latest set of allegations because they are \u201cfundamentally different.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, we are more able to speak with one voice on that subject than on some of the others,\u201d Kildee said of the House\u2019s slew of ongoing investigations. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the others go away, but I think this is clearly going to be the issue that\u2019s going to drive the bus.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders are continuing to discuss how to factor in the numerous other Trump-focused investigations that the House has launched, or set them aside in favor of more forcefully condemning Trump\u2019s July phone call with Zelensky.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer also privately discussed the possibility of focusing exclusively on Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelensky. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) echoed this strategy.\n\nThe intensifying impeachment fervor exploded Wednesday after the White House released a summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president that showed he explicitly sought a \u201cfavor\u201d: an investigation of Biden. By Wednesday afternoon, a majority of the House \u2014 217 Democrats plus independent Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan \u2014 was on record in support of formal impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe memo confirmed Democrats\u2019 strongest suspicions \u2014 that Trump pushed top Ukrainian officials to investigate his political rival while hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid was being held up. Trump also offered Zelensky Justice Department help in that investigation and emphasized his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was acting as his emissary on the matter.\n\n\u201cThe release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the president engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"The president has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad.\"\n\nThere remains no firm timeline for the process of whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House. But top Democrats are already sounding off about Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky, dubbing Wednesday\u2019s revelation a smoking gun.\n\n\u201cWhat those notes reflect is a classic mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said, accusing Trump of threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine for political purposes. \u201cThis is how a mafia boss talks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not concerned whether it is a quid pro quo or not,\u201d Schiff added. \u201cUkraine understood what this president wanted. He made it abundantly clear. He made it redundantly clear. He had his emissaries making it clear. And Ukraine knew what it needed to do if it wanted to get military assistance: and that is, help the president of the United States violate his oath of office.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "Lawmakers were outraged after seeing a White House readout of Trump's call, in which he urged the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney", "Andrew Desiderio", "Heather Caygle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xHDoau6VsE613gJxtt2Tdg--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/6971af4fb717d4887f84701ccbfc30be", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
