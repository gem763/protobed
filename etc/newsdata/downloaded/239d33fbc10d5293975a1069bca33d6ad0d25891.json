REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\n\nDUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland wants a deal on an orderly British exit from the European Union but Britain has so far failed to come up with a written plan, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe in the EU ...are open to a deal but it must achieve the aims of the backstop through a legally operable solution,\u201d Coveney told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe await written proposals from the UK side. We simply haven\u2019t seen any written proposals to date.\u201d\n\nAsked about plans to manage the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - and in particular the location of emergency checks in the event of no-deal - Coveney said he hoped to have clarity on the contentious issue weeks before Britain is due to leave the bloc on October 31.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t sign up to any (trade) agreement that requires checks with the UK,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cThe response will involve checks somewhere. I don\u2019t think they will be near the border.\u201d", "description": "Ireland wants a deal on an orderly British exit from the European Union but Britain has so far failed to come up with a written plan, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430880174&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G173", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
