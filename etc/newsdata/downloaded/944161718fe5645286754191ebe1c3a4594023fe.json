The sense of responsibility real ownership gives is the most motivational tool at our disposal.\"\n\nThe annual dividend payments and capital gains from Australian employee share schemes reached $2 billion in 2014-15 (the latest available figures), after more than doubling over the previous decade.\n\nShare plan limits\n\nWhile Lachlan McKnight, founder of law firm LegalVision, still arranges about 10 new equity share option plans for start-ups every month, he said regulations were preventing more people from enjoying their benefits.\n\nWhile the Coalition government was applauded by the start-up and scale-up sector for the reforms it made to share plans in 2015, offering exemptions to Labor laws that had made options taxable on issue rather than realisation, Mr McKnight said the exemptions did not go far enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, listed companies or those with annual revenues above $50 million don't qualify, and nor do companies incorporated more than seven years ago, or that are part of groups more than 10 years old.\n\n\"The whole venture capital-driven boom in Australian tech start-ups only really started seven years ago, so you've got a lot of companies still scaling up, who've got to find their way around landing top people with a massive tax bill,\" Mr McKnight said.\n\nMeanwhile, companies planning to issue options to more than 20 employees in any rolling 12-month period must prepare a product disclosure statement, a costly exercise that founders argue also forces them to spread sensitive strategic information.\n\nA disclosure statement is also mandatory for start-ups with more than 50 shareholders, even if most of those are part of a share plan.\n\nProtective measure\n\n\"It's crazy to count employees as shareholders in that context,\" said Alex McCauley, chief executive of start-up peak body StartupAUS.\n\n\"The 50 shareholder rule is there in broader corporate law to prevent companies raising heaps of money from people who aren't well enough informed \u2013 but employees have more information on their own company than anyone!\"\n\nMr McKnight said many founders were forced to enter complex, costly arrangements such as loan schemes to keep their share plans as a viable option for new hires.\n\n\"Or I'm seeing a lot of start-ups decide not to bother with an [employee share plan] at all, or just restrict it to a very small group of senior employees,\" he said.", "description": "After one of Robert Rowe's employees stole $1 million from him, the builder and Young Rich Lister knew he needed to give more back to his staff.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1935%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/61695e8756d6b59a8c7b9912594daeefd3c6c1cf", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
