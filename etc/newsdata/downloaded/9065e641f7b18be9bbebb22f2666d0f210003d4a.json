Though mortifying, the situation didn\u2019t exactly shock me \u2014 as a busty woman, I\u2019ve long known that button-downs weren\u2019t my friends. Whenever I wore them, my chest would strain at the fabric, leaving a persistent gaping hole at the largest part of my chest \u2014 and allowing co-workers and strangers on the train alike a little peep at my bra. The interview incident pushed me over the edge: I decided to swear off button-downs entirely.\n\nNearly a decade went by this way. Until 2016, when my fashion editor friend Lauren Chan designed a Lane Bryant and Glamour collaboration that focused on fashionable plus-size workwear \u2014 including a sleek black jumpsuit, a striped red-and-black shirtdress, and a white boyfriend shirt. In the photographs, the button-down looked stylish and professional and I found myself intrigued. I had my reservations (needless to say) but decided to order one. Much to my surprise, it fit perfectly \u2014 no gaping hole, no strained buttons. And after examining the garment, I realized why this was the case. The shirt has a clever mechanism \u2014 two tiny bonus buttons built on a placket (a small piece of extra fabric on the inside of your shirt) that holds the front together to prevent pulling, puckering, or gaping. And in case you move around a little too aggressively, and pulling or puckering or gaping does happen, the buttons-on-the-placket situation means that your skin won\u2019t show \u2014 only that little slip of fabric. It\u2019s thoroughly genius. And it single-handedly broke my shame-induced ban on button-down shirts.\n\nI should also mention that the shirt is just nice: the fabric is breathable, and even though it is a \u201cboyfriend\u201d cut, it isn\u2019t too boxy or too long. It has a classic collar and double-button cuffs that look really good rolled up to the elbow. It just feels good on. And it feels especially good to know that when I wear it, there\u2019s a zero percent chance I will accidentally expose myself.\n\nLane Bryant Button-Down Boyfriend Shirt $50 at Lane Bryant Buy\n\nOther Strategist-approved plus-size basics\n\nCoEdition Baby-Pleat Dress Writer Sarah Caldwell calls this, from CoEdition, \u201cthe perfect chic \u2018Oh, this old thing?\u2019 summer goth dress.\u201d It makes her butt good, hugs her waist, and has a tie that\u2019s superlong and hard to mess up. $99 at CoEdition Buy\n\nTorrid Black Cropped Premium Leggings Whitney is also a fan of these cropped, plus-size leggings. \u201cThe waistband is thick \u2014 about two inches \u2014 and supportive, meaning I never get that dreaded muffin top when standing or sitting. I wear a size 2, and they run from 00 (a women\u2019s medium, so not plus!) to 6 (size 30), making them truly accessible for women of all sizes, unlike brands that consider a 16 the supper end of plus-size.\u201d $23 at Torrid Buy\n\nNYDJ Women\u2019s Plus Size Ami Super Skinny Jeans The CurvyCon co-founder Chastity Garner Valentine loves these plus-size NYDJ Skinny Jeans for their tapered waist, small ankle opening, and amount of stretch \u2014 which, she says, is \u201cgreat for accentuating my kinds of curves \u2014 I have a butt.\u201d She owns somewhere between five to eight pairs of them, and none of them have worn out.
