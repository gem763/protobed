(that Hill) may have engaged in a sexual relationship with an individual on her congressional staff,\" and said it was investigating.\n\nHill, who is going through a divorce, apologized in her resignation letter for \"mistakes made along the way\" but also lamented a \"smear campaign\".\n\nHill blamed her husband and said she was pursuing legal options after media outlets published intimate photos that purported to be of the lawmaker.\n\n\"Having private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy,\" said Hill. \"It's also illegal.\"\n\nHill serves on the House Armed Services and Oversight and Reform Committees, where she is also vice chair.\n\nShe defeated incumbent Republican Steve Knight in a district north of Los Angeles, helping the Democrats win control of the House. Her district is seen by election analysts at the Cook Political Report as one of the most competitive in the country.\n\nAlthough Hill\u2019s departure could help Republicans win back her seat in November 2020, they still face an uphill climb in their effort to regain control of the House.", "description": "U.S. Representative Hill, facing ethics probe, resigns from Congress", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/international_newspapers_69x52._800x533_L_1419494241.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
