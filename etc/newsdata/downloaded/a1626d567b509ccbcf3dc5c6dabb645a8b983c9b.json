Mr. Rouda, Mr. Levin and Mr. Cisneros all said in separate interviews that the calls and emails that have come into their offices in the last week have been overwhelmingly in favor of pursuing impeachment.\n\nAnd Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who was the first freshman lawmaker to come out for the investigation last Monday, said that he received a number of calls from Republicans and independent voters who had pressed him to hold the president accountable.\n\nMr. Phillips\u2019s fellow Minnesotan, Representative Tom Emmer, a Republican who chairs the party\u2019s House campaign committee, said flatly that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment march \u201cwill cost them their majority in 2020.\u201d\n\nYet the most striking element of the CBS survey may have been the Republican movement on the matter: 23 percent of those surveyed said they supported an inquiry.\n\nWhile that is a relatively small number, it is likely higher in the more upscale G.O.P. districts, such as the one Mr. Phillips represents outside Minneapolis, and it suggests there is an appetite for at least an examination of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nThat was apparent at a panel held in Austin, Tex., Saturday in conjunction with the Texas Tribune\u2019s \u201cTribFest.\u201d While Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina, two of Mr. Trump\u2019s stoutest Republican allies in Congress, defended him, Representative Chip Roy of Texas said he wants \u201cto look at the facts.\u201d\n\nSome Republican strategists believe that the key for Mr. Trump is to make impeachment look like a partisan endeavor, with perceptions falling along the same lines of the country\u2019s existing political polarization. The danger for him, then, is that any cracks among Republican lawmakers on impeachment could muddy this red-and-blue divide that often influences voters to side with their preferred parties.", "description": "A tricky balancing act is underway for Democrats in battleground districts: protecting political gains from 2018 while selling voters on an inquiry into the president.", "authors": ["Jonathan Martin", "Catie Edmondson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/us/politics/29dc-backlash/29dc-backlash-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
