Pew surveyed more than 5,100 American adults who are members of its trends panel.\n\nBut while more people are getting news from social media, 62 percent said social media companies have too much control over the news people see, and 55 percent said the companies\u2019 efforts result in a worse mix of news for users, according to the report.\n\nPew found 82 percent of U.S. adults said social media companies treat some news organizations differently than others, with more than three in four saying that the companies favor news organizations that produce attention-grabbing articles, have a lot of social media followers and whose coverage \u201chas a certain political stance.\u201d\n\nFewer people said they believe social media companies favor news organizations that are well-established, have high reporting standards or whose coverage is politically neutral, according to the poll.\n\nFacebook is by far the most popular social media news source. Some 71 percent of Americans said they use the site, and 52 percent said they get news from on. YouTube was the next most possible social media site for news, with 28 percent of U.S. adults saying they get news there.\n\nTwitter was next with 17 percent of American adults saying they get news there, following by Facebook-owned Instagram with 14 percent. Less than 10 percent of U.S. adults said they get news from social media platforms like LinkedIn, Reddit, Snapchat or others.\n\nFacebook also had the largest portion of users who get news on the site, followed by Twitter and Reddit. Facebook has been working on ways to present accurate news to users since discovering its platform was used for misinformation campaigns. A news section is scheduled to launch on the site next month, and a tool called \u201cToday In\u201d has been focusing on an increasing number of areas that don\u2019t have much local news coverage.\n\nBut still, most Americans believe one-sided and inaccurate news on social media are problems, according to Pew\u2019s poll. More than half described them as \u201cvery big\u201d problems and 30 percent called them \u201cmoderately big\u201d problems.\n\nMore than a third said they believed censorship of the news and uncivil discussions about the news were \u201cvery big\u201d problems on social media, and fewer people expressed concern about harassment of journalists, news organizations or personalities being banned or seeing violent or disturbing images and videos.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Facebook is the most popular social media platform for news.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/03/0/0/whatsapp.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
