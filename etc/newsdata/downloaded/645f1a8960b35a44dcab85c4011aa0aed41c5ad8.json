But the stress and anxiety they feel may be too much. Psychologists say that young people need more time for play and self-guided exploration, without scrutiny from adults.\n\n\"What we're doing to children in school is, in my mind, cruel,\" Gray said. \"People want to blame social media, they want to blame video games, they want to blame bullying by other kids \u2014 this is the elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about.\"\n\nShayanne Gal/Insider\n\nIt's a sentiment that mirrors what cycling coach Charlie Townsend told Business Insider after one of his former cyclists, 23-year-old Olympic silver medalist Kelly Catlin, died by suicide last spring, just months after sustaining a concussion during winter bike training.\n\n\"The suicide really has caused me to do a lot of thinking about what the right way to develop kids is, and what they really need to go forward \u2014 not just in cycling \u2014 but in the rest of their life,\" Townsend said at the time.\n\nRead More: The suicide death of a 23-year-old Olympic cyclist highlights a disturbing trend. Her former coach says we could be doing more.\n\nShortly before her death, Catlin wrote some harsh final thoughts to herself.\n\n\"Principle: If I am not an athlete, I am nothing,\" she wrote, as reported by the Washington Post. And then, \"If I am in therapy, I have failed.\"\n\nAn engineering graduate student at Stanford University, Catlin was not the first to die by suicide on that campus this year. ( Other colleges are also recording notable suicide upticks.) Suicide is now the second leading cause of death for people in her age bracket, after accidents. Suicide deaths in young people are now more common than homicides, something that wasn't true 19 years ago when Catlin was a kid.\n\nShayanne Gal/Insider\n\nDepression and anxiety are also on the rise\n\nThe rise in suicides and depression isn't limited to older teens and young adults. One study published in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology earlier this year found that rates of major depressive episodes have more than doubled since the mid-2000s, in kids as young as 12 and young adults up to 25. (Most teens and young adults who attempt suicide have mental health issues, and many suffer from depression.)\n\nResearchers who recently took a look at three urban emergency rooms across the US found that nearly a third of kids from ages 10 to 12 screened positive for suicide risk. Another larger study of suicidal thoughts and attempts recorded by children's hospitals across the US in 2018 revealed spikes in the spring and fall, when school begins and ends. An additional 2015 study of California kids showed similarly that children and teens \"are more likely to present with concerns for danger to self or others while attending school,\" suggesting there may be something particularly toxic about it.\n\nGray suggests the issue runs deeper than just the charged classroom environment, and into the competitive, testing-oriented, and always-scheduled way that many kids' lives are run today.\n\n\"We are creating young people who are relatively emotionally fragile,\" he said. \"In school they have no freedom. They're told exactly what to do more so than ever in the past, and when they're home, they're kind of under home confinement, you know, it's like locked down. They're not allowed to go out and play with friends and just be kids. They have to be home, they have to be where parents can watch them.\"\n\nUnstructured play and unconditional love are cornerstones of healthy human development\n\nThe problem with this kind of daily schedule is that unstructured play time is an integral part of human development that helps kids develop courage, creativity, problem-solving, and social skills.\n\n\"That's how they develop the ability to deal with stress and fear, so when a real emergency comes in life, they're more prepared for it,\" Gray said.\n\nA small body of research suggests that kids from more affluent families may be more at risk of missing out on this unstructured social time, and it's making them more anxious and depressed, feeling isolated and pressured to achieve at all costs.\n\n\"No child should want for either food or affection,\" as developmental psychologist Suniya Luthar wrote in a 2003 study on the \"psychological costs of material wealth.\"\n\nPsychologist Jean Twenge, who wrote the book \"iGen\" has also noticed a change in young adults, but she's not so sure that technology isn't playing a role. She authored a study earlier this year in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology based on eight years of data from more than 600,000 people across the US, and found that more young people \u2014 particularly those in their early 20s \u2014 are going through sustained periods in which they're losing interest in life and leisure activities, at rates much higher than that same age group did just a decade ago.\n\nShe's not sure why this is happening, but she has a hunch that more screens aren't helping.\n\n\"Face-to-face social interaction among teens has declined during the digital age, and that has mental-health implications,\" Twenge told Business Insider earlier this year. \"Face-to-face social interaction tends to protect against depression in a way that digital interaction does not.\"\n\nScreens can relieve stress and improve problem-solving, too\n\n\"What makes kids happy is freedom and play,\" Gray said. \"There's no question about that, this is what children are designed to do.\"\n\nPlay can be digital. Research has shown that video games can relieve stress, improve problem-solving, and hand-eye coordination, too. Some therapists are now endorsing apps that allow people to text a therapist when they're having a rough time.\n\n\"[Screens] are a part of our lives so it becomes about teaching kids how to live with them in a healthy and ethical way,\" Jordan Shapiro, a research psychologist and author of \"The New Childhood,\" previously told Insider. \"We've moved into a phase of humanity where we mediate through technology so its about figuring out how to do that compassionately.\"\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics suggests similarly that \"problems begin when media use displaces physical activity, hands-on exploration and face-to-face social interaction in the real world, which is critical to learning.\"\n\nWhat to do if you're worried someone might be suicidal\n\nOnly a medical professional can diagnose someone as suicidal, but asking the question, \"Are you thinking about killing yourself?\" and providing a safe space for someone to talk about their feelings without judgment or shame can be extremely helpful. (Even a text can help.)\n\nThere are several warning signs to keep an eye out for if you're worried that someone close to you may be suicidal.\n\nThese include:\n\nThreatening to hurt or kill themselves\n\nLooking for ways to complete suicide, like getting access to pills or a gun\n\nTalking about death, dying, or suicide out loud or on social media\n\nRage and revenge-seeking\n\nBeing reckless or doing uncharacteristically risky things\n\nFeeling trapped and withdrawing from social activities\n\nAnxiety or trouble sleeping\n\nDramatic shifts in mood\n\nTell the person that you care, and let them do most of the talking about how they're feeling. Remember that thoughts of suicide are common and often associated with a treatable mental disorder.", "description": "Suicide has risen dramatically among young Americans from ages 10 to 24.
