According to United Nations data, by 2050, one in six people in the world will be over age 65, up from one in 11 right now. Meanwhile, in Europe and North America, by 2050, one in four people could be 65 or over.\n\nUnsurprisingly, startups increasingly recognize opportunities to cater to this aging population. Some are developing products to sell to individuals and their family members directly; others are coming up with ways to empower those who work directly with older Americans.\n\nBrainCheck, a 20-person, Houston-based startup whose cognitive healthcare product aims to help physicians assess and track the mental health of their patients, is among the latter. Investors like what it has put together, too. Today, the startup is announcing $8 million in Series A funding round co-led by S3 Ventures and Tensility Venture Partners.\n\nWe talked earlier today with BrainCheck cofounder and CEO Yael Katz to better understand what her company has created and why it might be of interest to doctors who don\u2019t know about it. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTC: You\u2019re a neuroscientist. You started BrianCheck with David Eagleman, another neuroscientist and the CEO of NeoSensory, a company that develops devices for sensory substitution. Why? What\u2019s the opportunity here?\n\nYK: We looked across the landscape, and we realized that most cognitive assessment is [handled by] a subspecialty of clinical psychology called neuropsychology, where patients are given a series a tests and each is designed to probe a different type of brain function \u2014 memory, visual attention, reasoning, executive function. They measure speed and accuracy, and based on that, determine whether there\u2019s a deficit in that domain. But the tests were classically done on paper and it was a lengthy process. We digitized them and gamified them and made them accessible to everyone who is upstream of neuropsychology, including neurologists and primary care doctors.\n\nWe created a tech solution that provides clinical decision support to physicians so they can manage patients\u2019 cognitive health. There are 250,000 primary care physicians in the U.S. and 12,000 neurologists and [they\u2019re confronting] what\u2019s been called a silver tsunami. With so many becoming elderly, it\u2019s not possible for them to address the need of the aging population without tech to help them.\n\nTC: How does your product work, and how is it administered?\n\nYK: An assessment is all done on an iPad and takes about 10 minutes. They\u2019re typically administered in a doctor\u2019s office by medical technicians, though they can be administered remotely through telemedicine, too.\n\nTC: These are online quizzes?\n\nYK: Not quizzes and not subjective questions like, \u2018How do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019 but rather objective tasks, like connect the dots, and which way is the center arrow pointing \u2014 all while measuring speed and accuracy.\n\nTC: How much does it cost these doctors\u2019 offices, and how are you getting word out?\n\nYZ: We sell a monthly subscription to doctors and it\u2019s a tiered pricing model as measured by volume. We meet doctors at conferences and we publish blog posts and white papers and through that process, we meet them and sell products to them, beginning with a free trial for 30 days, during which time we also give them a web demo.\n\n[What we\u2019re selling] is reimbursable by insurance because it helps them report on and optimize metrics like patient satisfaction. Medicare created a new code to compensate doctors for cognitive care planning though it was rarely used because the requirements and knowledge involved was so complicated. When we came along, we said, let us help you do what you\u2019re trying to do, and it\u2019s been very rewarding.\n\nTC: Say one of these assessments enables a non specialist to determine that someone is losing memory or can\u2019t think as sharply. What then?\n\nYZ: There\u2019s phrase: \u201cDiagnose and adios.\u201d Unfortunately, a lot of doctors used to see their jobs as being done once an assessment was made. It wasn\u2019t appreciated that impairment and dementia are things you can address. But about one third of dementia is preventable, and once you have the disease, it can be slowed. It\u2019s hard because it requires a lot of one-on-one work, so we created a tech solution that uses the output of tests to provide clinical support to physicians so they can manage patients\u2019 cognitive health. We provide personalized recommendations in a way that\u2019s scalable.\n\nTC: Meaning you suggest an action plan for the doctors to pass along to their patients based on these assessments?\n\nYZ: There are nine modifiable risk factors found to account for a third of [dementia cases], including certain medications that can exacerbate cognitive impairment, including poorly controlled cardiovascular health, hearing impairment, and depression. People can have issues for many reasons \u2014 multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s \u2014 but health conditions like major depression and physical conditions like cancer and treatments like chemotherapy can cause brain fog. We suggest a care plan that goes to the doctor who then uses that information and modifies it. A lot of it has to do with medication management.\n\nA lot of the time, a doctor \u2014 and family members \u2014 don\u2019t know how impaired a patient is. You can have a whole conversation with someone during a doctor\u2019s visit who is regaling you with great conversation, then you realize they have massive cognitive deficits. These assessments kind of put everyone on the same page.\n\nTC: You\u2019ve raised capital, how will you use it to move your product forward?\n\nYK: We\u2019ll be combining our assessments with digital biomarkers like changing voice patterns and a test of eye movements, and we have developed an eye-tracking technology and voice algorithms, but those are still in clinical development; we\u2019re trying to get FDA approval for them now.\n\nTC: Interesting that changing voice patterns can help you diagnose cognitive decline.\n\nYK: We aren\u2019t diagnosing disease. Think of us as a thermometer that [can highlight] how much impairment is there and in what areas and how it\u2019s progressive over time.\n\nTC: What can you tell readers who might worry about their privacy as it relates to your product?\n\nYK: Our software is HIPAA compliant. We make sure our engineers are trained and up to date. The FDA requires that we we put a lot of standards in place and we ensure that our database is built in accordance with best practices. I think we\u2019re doing as good a job as anyone can.\n\nPrivacy is a concern in general. Unfortunately, companies big and small have to be ever vigilant about a data breach.", "description": "All over the globe, the population of people who are aged 65 and older is growing faster than every other age group.
