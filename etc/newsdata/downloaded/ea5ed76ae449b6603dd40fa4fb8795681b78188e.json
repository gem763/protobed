For some, a denial could even lead to their deportation. Jason Boyd, policy counsel at American Immigration Lawyers Association, told Axios that the rule would \"endanger the well-being of families throughout the nation while placing all too many of them at risk of separation.\" New immigrants: Immigrants applying for U.S. visas would face tougher tests determining whether they are considered a \"public charge.\" Under current policy, only immigrants who would be primarily dependent on government assistance are considered a public charge, but the proposed rule would greatly broaden that definition. The chilling effect: Greenberg told Axios he expects the rule to discourage many immigrants from using public benefits they may need out of fear of losing their legal status.\n\nThe other side: The Trump administration sees the change as promoting self-sufficiency among immigrants, according to the proposed rule. Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen noted in announcing the proposal that under federal law, \"those seeking to immigrate to the United States must show they can support themselves financially.\u201d\n\nIt's impossible to know exactly how many immigrants could end up being denied a green card or visa due to the many factors that would determine who is considered a public charge. And immigration experts worry it could lead to inconsistent decision making.\n\n\u201cThe proposed rule would prove broadly destructive... It would also raise to new heights the Trump administration\u2019s invisible wall, further shutting out legal immigrants from the country.\"\n\n\u2014 Jason Boyd\n\nThe proposal was softened from earlier, leaked versions. At this point, it does not include CHIP, which provides health coverage for low-income children. The proposed rule asks for comments on whether CHIP should be included in the final version, however.\n\nThe exceptions:", "description": "If they use social safety net programs such as Medicaid, housing and food stamps.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/azyVIUP5IJyH_GFramihFeuhU6k=/0x0:2400x1350/1920x1080/2018/09/25/1537882421382.png", "published_at": "2018-09-26"}
