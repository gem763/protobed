His name is Samuel Little, and over the last year and a half he has confessed to 93 murders. That's more than were committed by Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer combined. No one would have known the scale of Little's crimes if not for a Texas Ranger who had a hunch. Little had never confessed to anyone about anything, but over the course of 700 hours of interviews, Ranger James Holland coaxed the 79-year-old into revealing his life's work. The confessions have enabled investigators across the country to solve dozens of cold cases, but Holland needs help to match up the rest. It's why the Texas Ranger is telling us the story of how he got America's deadliest serial killer to confess.\n\nWith a swagger that would make John Wayne envious, Texas Ranger James Holland arrived this summer at the California State Prison. He was escorted to the interview room for another round with Samuel Little, the killer who went undetected for nearly half a century.\n\nSamuel Little speaks with Texas Ranger James Holland\n\nDon't be fooled by his grandfatherly appearance...\n\nSamuel Little: I got away with numerous murders, of women, in my life over the span of 50 years\u2026\n\nNinety-three murders in 19 states, from 1970 to 2005. Now, near the end of his own life and out of appeals, Little has been spilling his secrets to Ranger Holland over the course of several interviews since May of last year.\n\nJames Holland: Where did you kill the most?\n\nSamuel Little: Oh that's easy, Florida and California.\n\nJames Holland: What city did you kill the most in?\n\nSamuel Little: Miami and Los Angeles.\n\nJames Holland: And how many did you kill in Los Angeles.\n\nSamuel Little: Los Angeles, approximately 20.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: So how did he skip by so long?\n\nJames Holland: He was so good at what he did. You know, 'How did you get away with it, Sammy?' Did the crime, left town.\n\nThe drifter from Ohio preyed upon the fringes of society. Prostitutes, drug addicts, women he believed the police wouldn't work too hard to find. The ranger says Little was a cunning killer who sized up his victims and his surroundings.\n\nJames Holland: The first thing I picked up on is how wicked smart he was.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Smart?\n\nJames Holland: Oh, like genius. Yes, absolutely.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why, why do you say that?\n\nJames Holland: Oh, well, number one, you know, the photographic memory, his memory for details. You know, like, Sammy, tell me what's around her? There's three tombstones over there. There's a caliche road. Drive down a quarter of a mile, there's a white Baptist church that needs to be whitewashed. Phenomenal.\n\nFor example, Little remembered unusual arches close to the spot where he killed a woman outside of Miami. Sure enough, when Miami detectives investigated, they saw the arches. Little had strangled Miriam Chapman near those arches in 1976.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You've never felt like he sent you on some wild goose chase?\n\nJames Holland: No. Nothing he's ever said has been proven to be wrong or false. We've been able to prove up almost everything he said.\n\nBecause of Little's confessions, judges and prosecutors nationwide have been able to close long-standing cases.\n\nJudge: What is your plea to the charge of murder?\n\nSamuel Little: Guilty.\n\nHere was Little via a video link from his prison in August, pleading guilty to two stranglings in Cincinnati. In just over a year, 50 cold cases that had been dormant for decades, have been solved due to the detailed confessions Little provided to the ranger.\n\nJames Holland: Tell me about North Little Rock. Tell me what that girl looked like\u2026\n\nSamuel Little: Had buck teeth. Had a gap between her teeth, that's what it was.\n\nLittle grows disturbingly animated as he describes how he strangled his victims.\n\nSamuel Little: She was fighting for her life, and I'm fighting for my pleasure\u2026\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: So how do you reach a serial killer? How do you get 'em to talk?\n\nJames Holland: You avoid the things that normally work for investigators.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What do you mean by that?\n\nJames Holland: You avoid things like remorse and closure for the family.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Cause they don't have remorse, and they don't care about closure?\n\nJames Holland: No. It doesn't appeal to them at all. I mean, you're asking them to open up their soul to the things that are more intimate to them than anything in life. Why should they do that with you? And that's what you're workin' for.\n\nSamuel Little: A little skinny black girl. Real friendly. She was laughing while I was killing her.\n\nJames Holland: With Sammy, there's indications of visualization, of when he's thinking about a crime scene. He'll start stroking his face. And as he's starting to picture a victim, you'll see him look out and up. And you can tell he has this revolving carousel of victims, and it's just spinning, and he's waiting for it to stop at the one that he wants to talk about.\n\nTexas Ranger James Holland\n\nInvestigators had discovered that Little liked to sketch. Ranger Holland gave him art supplies, wondering if he might be able to use his remarkable memory to draw his victims. And he has\u2026\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Wow. These are all of his drawings.\n\nJames Holland: These are all his.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: They're pretty detailed.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Is there one that you looked at and you knew right away, oh, that's\u2026\n\nJames Holland: There's a lot of them.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Really? Yeah\u2026\n\nJames Holland: Yeah, as soon as we matched it up.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How many has he sketched?\n\nJames Holland: I think there's somewhere around 50.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: The note on this one is super creepy.\n\nJames Holland: 'Sam killed me but I love him.' He writes notes on some of the drawings.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Tall girl by the highway. Girl in a strip joint. Left in the woods.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: 1972? And it's so\u2026\n\nJames Holland: Right, yes, and we've matched that one up.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You have\u2026\n\nJames Holland: Yes, that's a New Orleans murder.\n\nTexas Ranger James Holand shows correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi the sketches Samuel Littler has drawn of some of his victims\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: I can't remember the person who checked me out of the hotel this morning. If someone gave me a million dollars to draw her face I couldn't do it. The fact that he can still do this.\n\nJames Holland: Right. He basically takes a photograph in his mind of exactly what he sees as he leaves them.\n\nA year and a half ago, Ranger Holland had never heard of Samuel Little. Little was rotting away in this prison at the edge of California's Mojave Desert, sentenced to three life terms in 2014 for strangling three women. In court, prosecutors had labeled Little a sexual predator. He denied everything and was defiant to the end.\n\nBut the FBI noted that Little had somehow skirted charges for violent crimes year after year in state after state in places where women disappeared, including Texas. That drew the interest of Ranger James Holland, a skilled interviewer who says he's convinced dozens of killers to confess during his career.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Typically when people want you involved in a case, they want you there because why?\n\nJames Holland: Virtually every single case that I ever deal with, there's no DNA evidence, there's no forensics, there's no nothing.\n\nAnd there was nothing linking Samuel Little to additional murders. Just suspicions. The ranger was intrigued by a cold case in Odessa, Texas. Denise Brothers was a prostitute working on the wrong side of town. Then she went missing in 1994\u2026\n\nDamien: We looked everywhere\u2026\n\nHer son Damien remembers driving around Odessa with his grandparents looking for her. A month later, Denise Brothers' body was found at the back of an abandoned parking lot, dumped in brush.\n\nDamien: We were asked to come down and look at the body.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You had to do that?\n\nDamien: Yeah.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How old were you?\n\nDamien: 14.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: That sticks with you\u2026\n\nDamien: Yeah.\n\nFor 24 years, Damien didn't know who killed his mother or why. Ranger Holland learned Denise Brothers had been strangled and that Samuel Little was in West Texas at the time.\n\n\n\nJames Holland: Did Sammy do it? I don't know, but I felt like there was a, you know a reasonable probability that he did it.\n\nTo find out if his instinct was right, the ranger went to California last year to interview Little, who had always been hostile to law enforcement.\n\nJames Holland: Did I believe he was going to confess? (laughs) Complete arrogance on my part. Absolutely.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And for the first couple of minutes, it really was going quite poorly. He's\u2026\n\nJames Holland: Oh, horrible.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: ...he's raging.\n\nJames Holland: Oh, yes.\n\nLittle vented in the interview room for 30 minutes that he had been wrongly depicted as a rapist\u2026\n\nJames Holland: There was no doubt in my mind that Samuel Little was not a rapist. But I told him he knew it, and I knew it that he was a killer. And he stops and he kinda looks at me for a second. And he didn't seem to mind it. And then you could see in his eyes as he's lookin' away, and he follows back as I say the word, 'killer.' And that appealed to him. That's how he defines himself.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: As a killer?\n\nJames Holland: Yes.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Was there a moment where you said, 'I've got him?'\n\nJames Holland: Yeah, when he talked about there may be three victims in Texas\u2026\n\nThree victims and one of them was in Odessa, Texas\u2026\n\nChristie Palazzolo: All of a sudden, we turned to each other. 'Oh my gosh, he's talkin' about Odessa.' And we grab our files and start goin' through and checking what he's talkin' about and verifying.\n\nChristie Palazzolo of the FBI and Angela Williamson of the Department of Justice analyze violent crimes. They were listening to the interview across the hall and had access to the FBI database and the Denise Brothers file\u2026\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You've got the photos of the crime scene in front of you. Did it match up right away?\n\nAngela Williamson: Oh yes (laugh).\n\nChristie Palazzolo: Yeah.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And he had details\u2026\n\nChristie Palazzolo: Yes.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: ...that hadn't been reported?\n\nChristie Palazzolo: Extreme details, yes\u2026\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Like what?\n\nAngela Williamson: In Denise's case, he remembered that she wore a denture.\n\n\n\nThe autopsy confirmed Brothers did wear a denture. All the details matched. Samuel Little had killed Denise Brothers. Ranger Holland knew he was on to something big. He schemed to have Little extradited to Texas for a few months so he could talk to him around the clock and extract more confessions\u2026\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: I would think Texas with the death penalty is the last place a killer like Sammy Little wants to go.\n\nJames Holland: Basically, what I told him was, I can go to the district attorney and I can ask him to take the death penalty off the table. And, and I believe that he will do that.\n\nWhich was especially brazen since Ranger Holland had never met the district attorney in Odessa, Bobby Bland.\n\nBobby Bland: And he said, 'I'd like a letter from you on your letterhead, saying that you would waive the death penalty.' And I said, 'Well, (chuckle) you know, that's a pretty tall order just to do blindly.'\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: So why? Why did you do it?\n\nBobby Bland: There's a greater good. This strange (chuckle) ranger that was callin' me from California, telling me he had a serial killer. I put my faith in him.\n\nThe next morning, the letter waiving the death penalty was in Samuel Little's hands. Last September, the rangers sent a plane to whisk Little to Texas, where he was housed in the Wise County Jail. For 48 straight days, for hours on end, the two men sat in a small room. During that time, Little confessed to 65 of his murders. The ranger plied Little with pizza and Dr. Pepper to keep the stories flowing.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: People will hear this and go, why were you treating a serial killer so well?\n\nJames Holland: What do I say to that? I say that we can have one case or we can have 93 cases.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: It was in your best interest for him to be comfortable.\n\nJames Holland: Oh absolutely, yes, yes.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: So why you? Why did he finally confess to you?\n\nJames Holland: At the end of the day (sigh) maybe Sammy just liked me.\n\nToday, Little is back at the California State Prison. We wanted to interview him on camera, but state law won't allow it. So we asked him to call us.\n\nHe did, answering our questions for nearly an hour. We wondered why he decided to confess now.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Are you worried that there might be innocent people in jail for some of your crimes?\n\nSamuel Little: Probably be numerous people who are-- been convicted and sent to penitentiary on my behalf. I say, 'If I can help get somebody out of jail, you know, God might smile a little bit more on me.'\n\nFor most of our call, Little spoke of his victims.\n\nSamuel Little: They was broke and homeless and they walked right into my spider web.\n\nIt was uncomfortable to listen to his graphic stories. Towards the end of the interview we asked him to reflect on the depths of his crimes.\n\nSamuel Little: I don't think there was another person that did what I liked to do. I think I'm the only one in the world. That's not an honor. That's a curse.\n\nWith Little's old age, failing health and a fear that his memory could slip, there is urgency to figure out who and where the rest of his victims are.\n\nJames Holland: It's kind of like never ending.You have to continue. You have to finish it.\n\nRanger Holland's been encouraging Little to keep drawing. Three new sketches arrived at the ranger's office just last week. Three new faces last seen in the mind of the most prolific serial killer in American history.\n\nProduced by Draggan Mihailovich, Jacqueline Williams and Claire St. Amant", "description": "Texas Ranger James Holland tells \"60 Minutes\" how he got serial killer Samuel Little to confess to his crimes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/06/350dd307-e030-4738-9edd-0d8cf0b70185/thumbnail/1200x630/875c02a42df994ffcb177b417a91b34a/serialkillergrabs01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
