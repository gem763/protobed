But what if you\u2019re the kind of person who prefers to stay out of the spotlight?\n\nFor introverts, social media poses all sorts of challenges. For one, introverts often find interactions difficult and draining, and they would largely prefer to do their work undisturbed, without self-promotion. What\u2019s more, introverts may not have a huge list of real-life contacts to jump-start their online experience. And because they often wait to be asked for input, the constant self-expression and self-disclosure of social media may feel far from instinctive.\n\nBut social media is just as important for introverts as for extroverts\u2014or even more so, since it offers a way to build a professional network and reputation for those who usually shy away from face-to-face networking. Indeed, recent research suggests that it is introverts who benefit most from using social media.\n\nA survey of college students showed that Facebook usage is associated with an increase in face-to-face interaction\u2014but only for introverts. Another study showed that social-media usage increases the likelihood of introverts getting involved in their communities and interacting with a wider range of people.\n\nTo tap into these benefits, introverts need an approach to social media that suits their particular strengths and temperament. Here\u2019s what I recommend:\n\nDon\u2019t think of it as a \u201cpersonal brand\u201d: Much of the conventional wisdom about using social media as a professional tool revolves around promoting your particular skills and expertise as a coherent, distinctive package.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to think of that as \u201cbranding\u201d: After all, you\u2019re a person, not a product. Rather than thinking of this kind of activity as self-promotion\u2014which may be anathema to introverts\u2014think of it as providing an actual service to all the people who can benefit from your curation and insight.\n\nThat will take away the pressure to see social networks as a stage where you have to perform, and instead allow you to create a social-media experience that actually suits your own pace and temperament.\n\nManage your exposure: Creating or updating a social-media profile needn\u2019t involve sharing everything with everyone. Extroverts might delight in seeing their follower counts balloon or their networks expand with all kinds of people they don\u2019t actually know, but not everybody loves the prospect of being scrutinized by strangers.\n\nInstead, use your social-network settings to adjust who can see your profile or your individual posts. For example, you can set your Twitter or Instagram profile to \u201cprivate,\u201d in which case your posts will be visible only to people you specifically accept as friends; on Facebook or LinkedIn, you can adjust the privacy settings on your profile (or on individual posts) to control what different people get to see.\n\nAnd remember: There is nothing wrong with using social media to connect with a small number of valued colleagues and deepen those relationships rather than aim for the largest possible audience.\n\nStick to your comfort zone: Likewise, you can tailor your social-media presence to the types of content you feel comfortable sharing. Some people feel awkward about putting their thoughts into words but enjoy sharing their ideas visually: It\u2019s completely legitimate to post photos (on Instagram or Twitter or LinkedIn) to give your perspective on your area of expertise. For example, a marketing expert might post photos of brilliant billboards, or a designer could offer shots of workspaces that foster collaboration.\n\nSchedule your shares: The real-time frenzy of social media can be exhausting for those who need to pace their social interactions. But you can have a consistent social-media presence even if you prefer to spend hours or days on your own. The easiest way to do that is by taking a half-hour once or twice a week to schedule updates that can automatically be sent out over the next few days, using a tool like Buffer or Hootsuite. If you do that work during the windows when you\u2019re feeling more sociable, you get the benefits of regular updates without having to force yourself to interact when you\u2019re not up for it.\n\nLimit your disclosures: You also don\u2019t have to post anything too personal. If you don\u2019t like to talk about yourself, don\u2019t\u2014your lack of narcissism will make you a refreshing change for your followers (and reduce the heartache that extroverts face when they disclose too much and face the fact that nothing ever truly disappears from the internet).\n\nListen and learn: In fact, you don\u2019t have to post anything to get value from social media: Just \u201clurking\u201d (i.e., watching or reading without posting yourself) on social media can be a useful source of information and insight. Use Twitter\u2019s \u201cLists\u201d feature to build and follow a list of experts or professionals who regularly share useful insights and resources, or follow a handful of top experts on LinkedIn and let them lead you to the most important conversations.\n\nGive yourself a hidey-hole: Both introverts and extroverts can get more out of social media by picking one social network where they allow themselves to create a purely personal presence, and limit their connections to people they know well. Even if you\u2019re mostly using social media for professional purposes, you can build your comfort with the whole experience of social networking by picking one platform where you won\u2019t worry about the strategic impact of your posts (other than avoiding anything that could embarrass you, your employer or your clients). Keep that profile relatively private, and use it to exchange news and updates with the people you care about most. By creating a single social-media presence that is just for your own personal enjoyment, you may discover a new level of comfort with engaging online professionally, too.\n\nDr. Samuel is a technology researcher and the author of \u201cWork Smarter With Social Media.\u201d Email her at reports@wsj.com.", "description": "How professionals who prefer to stay out of the spotlight can build a personal presence.", "authors": ["Alexandra Samuel", "Agam Shah", "Alina Dizik", "Christina Binkley", "Brianna Abbott"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-ER662_introv_SOC_20190807142631.jpg"}
