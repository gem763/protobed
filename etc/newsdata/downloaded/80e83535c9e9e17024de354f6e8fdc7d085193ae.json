Since a temporary bottom was found at the start of September, altcoins have steadily gained value in their BTC pairings. Take the following, for example: ETH/BTC is up +32%, XRP/BTC +27% and XLM/BTC has gained +29% during this time.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the altcoin market to investigate what is happening.\n\nAltcoins total market capitalization chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe altcoins market cap has been in a prolonged downturn since the beginning of July when the market reached a $126 billion cap. This same level served as a support in 2018. A harsh rejection was followed by a bearish downtrend which knocked the market cap all the way back towards the support near $60\u201366 billion.\n\nCurrently, the market is resting on an important order block, which was previously found to be a support and trading range back in September through November of 2017.\n\nBased on this view, it\u2019s clear that the market has to break upwards to become bullish again, as otherwise the downwards trend will continue.\n\nReferencing historical data of the altcoins market price action, one can conclude that altcoins perform best when there is a slow upward move from Bitcoin. In some scenarios, altcoins even outperform Bitcoin when it\u2019s price is slowly ascending.\n\nClearly, in order for altcoins to rally, Bitcoin first has to find support. That\u2019s the key marker that is needed for altcoins to start moving alongside BTC.\n\nBearish retest or accumulation?\n\nTotal altcoins market capitalization 6-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf we zoom in, the chart above shows a bearish retest of the $66 billion level. In order for this scenario to turn bullish, the altcoins market capitalization has to break above the $66 billion level and reclaim is as a support.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the altcoins market cap will continue in this range and $57\u201359 billion has to remain a support in order to have some upwards perspectives. Lose this zone and the $35\u2013$40 billion range is the next area to look for.\n\nHowever, as long as the $57\u2013$59 billion area holds as a support and the market cap moves inside the developing falling wedge structure, we could see a few slight signs of a short term reversal.\n\nSome signs to look for in this potential bottoming scenario are bullish divergences or accumulation movements (marked by sideways patterns in a tight range).\n\nConfirmation of these movements should follow later this month as the pattern and trend lines are coming together in preparation for a decisive move.\n\nEthereum 2.0 FOMO to come?\n\nHistorical data shows that Ethereum is often the main indicator for altcoins movement. This is partially because of its market cap size and the fact that the majority of the smaller coins are ERC-20 tokens built on the Ethereum platform.\n\nAlongside this key indicator, Ethereum is working toward the release of Ethereum 2.0 which is expected to launch in Q4 of 2019. This could be a gamechanger for altcoins and a possible trigger for the market to move upwards. Price typically runs up prior to the event, so it\u2019s possible that traders will buy the rumor and sell the news.\n\nA bullish breakout awaits Ether\n\nETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice that the ETH/USD chart shares some similarities with the total altcoins market capitalization chart.\n\nEther is also hovering inside a falling wedge structure that has been in a downtrend since peaking at $368 toward the end of June. The price bounced on an important support at $155\u2013$160 which was previously a resistance in early 2019.\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nOn the shorter time frame, a bearish retest of $183 occurred, which led the price to range a little bit more. As long as the Ether price holds the $155\u2013$160 area as support, a major support/resistance flip could occur and some upwards price movements are ready to take place.\n\nWill Ether follow previous market cycles?\n\nETH/BTC Chart. Source: TradingView\n\nMarket cycles occasionally copy each other as they are essentially based on investors\u2019 psychological behavior. Ethereum is a beautiful example and there are similarities between the 2017\u20132019 pattern and the 2016\u20132017 pattern.\n\nThe floor at 0.0245 Satoshis (sats) was broken and the next support was reached before a reversal took place. This was confirmed through bullish divergences. Every time the market makes a trend reversal, these bullish divergences can be spotted. In fact, during the summer of 2019 the same happened with the Ether/Bitcoin pair on the longer-term time frames.\n\nCombining the study of these market cycles with the other bullish factors mentioned above (ETH 2.0 event, potential falling wedge on the ETH/USD pair), an upside breakout is likely to occur during Q4 2019. Especially given that the descending trendline will be tested during the same quarter of this year.\n\nHowever, how does this line up with the altcoin dominance rate in general? Can bullish arguments be found in that chart?\n\nAltcoin dominance slowly flips green\n\nAltcoin dominance chart. Source: Cointrader.pro\n\nInterestingly enough, the altcoin dominance chart is still holding up to the trendline, but it should be noted that the trendline can\u2019t hold up forever as the dominance chart can\u2019t go above 100%.\n\nIf we compare the altcoin dominance chart to previous cycles, several confluences can be found in previous periods. In every period a bullish divergence showed up before a bullish break on altcoins.\n\nSomething similar is structured in the current markets and similar bullish divergences can be observed. These divergences can also be found on important pairs like ETH/BTC, DOGE/BTC and other altcoins. This adds strength to the argument that a trend reversal could be in the making.\n\nBitcoin needs to break upwards\n\nAs stated previously, Bitcoin first needs to break upwards before altcoins can start outperforming it. So far, altcoins have failed to show bullish indicators during sharp downside movements from Bitcoin.\n\nIn that regard, both Bitcoin and Ethereum need to break out of their falling wedge to the upside and then a significant bullish period for altcoins might occur in Q4 2019. Confluent with the signals (bullish divergences on multiple altcoin pairs), a bullish breakout is not off the table.\n\nFrom a macro perspective things are still looking fine, but some essential movements need to occur for confirmation of the market. Given that the majority of investors are expecting further downside movement on Bitcoin and crypto, something different is likely to happen.\n\nIf there is one thing that the crypto sector has shown us, it is that the majority is almost never right when it comes to calling the moves of the market.", "description": "Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped and consolidated, but the altseason failed to come back.
