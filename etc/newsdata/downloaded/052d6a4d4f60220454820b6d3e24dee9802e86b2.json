The last batch of cars comprised of 420 Saab 9-3Aeros.\n\nThe car now being auctioned out is a Saab 9-3 MY14 Silver 2.0T Automatic with only approximately 66km on the odometer. It was set aside from the production line to undergo a development test that was never carried out. Subsequently, it was used as a reference vehicle during the limited production run.\n\nWhen production stopped in May 2014 the car was parked in the Nevs factory in the event petrol car production might resume. So, while all other Saab 9-3 were sold to customers in different installments, this reference car remained untouched for almost five years.\n\nImage: Bilweb Auctions\n\nFacts: The last new Saab Production year: 2013 Model: Saab 9-3 MY14 Condition: Unused Number of seats: Five, beige leather, dark details Exterior color: \"Diamond Silver\u201d Motor: 2.0 Turbo4, 164kW Transmission: Automatic Fuel type: Petrol Mileage: Approxmately 70 km CO2: 200 g/km Chassis number: YTNFD4AZXE1100257\n\nImage: Bilweb Auctions", "description": "The final Saab, an ultra-rare 9-3 Y14 silver 2.0T Automatic with only 66km on the odometer, will go under the hammer in late October.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9258/45deda2cacba4cf9b8da1eb13c77af4f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
