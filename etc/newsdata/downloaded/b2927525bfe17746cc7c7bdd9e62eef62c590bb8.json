In the upcoming book, Nevils alleges that Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nIn the letter, Lauer, who was fired in November 2017 due to Nevils\u2019 complaint, said he stayed mostly silent for the past two years to protect his family. He now calls his silence \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault. It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense,\u201d he said. \u201cI had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts. We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex. Each act was mutual and completely consensual.\u201d\n\nPEOPLE is out to Nevils for comment.\n\nLauer continued: \u201cThe story Brooke tells is filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter. Nothing could be further from the truth. There was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object. She certainly did not cry. She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner. At no time did she behave in a way that made it appear she was incapable of consent. She seemed to know exactly what she wanted to do. The only concern she expressed was that someone might see her leaving my room. She embraced me at the door as she left.\u201d\n\nLauer, who recently finalized his divorce from longtime wife Annette Roque, acknowledged that the encounter was the beginning of his affair with Nevils and \u201cthe first of many sexual encounters between us over the next several months.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt no time, during or after her multiple visits to my apartment, did she express in words or actions any discomfort with being there, or with our affair,\u201d he said. \u201cShe also went out of her way to see me several times in my dressing room at work, and on one of those occasions we had a sexual encounter. It showed terrible judgment on my part, but it was completely mutual and consensual.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrooke now says that she was terrified about the control I had over her career and felt pressure to agree to our encounters after Sochi. But at no time during our relationship did Brooke work for me, the Today Show, or NBC News,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe worked for Meredith Vieira (who had not worked for the Today Show in several years) in a completely different part of the network, and I had no role in reviewing Brooke\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Matt Lauer Admitted to \u2018Engaging in Sexual Activity\u2019 with the Woman Who Reported Him, NBC Says\n\nLauer admitted he ended the affair \u201cpoorly\u201d and \u201csimply stopped communicating\u201d with Nevils.\n\n\u201cShe admitted to NBC at the time she filed her complaint that she called me late at night while I was home with my family in an effort to rekindle the affair,\u201d he alleged. \u201cBut I attempted to go back to my life and pretend as if nothing had happened. I understand how that must have made her feel. However, being upset or having second thoughts does not give anyone the right to make false accusations years later about an affair in which they fully and willingly participated.\u201d\n\nLauer said that when he was first made aware of Nevils\u2019 complaint, he was not told that she had claimed their encounter in Sochi was non-consensual, adding, \u201cHad I been, I would have defended myself immediately.\u201d\n\nLauer, who pointed out what he claims are \u201ccontradictions\u201d in Nevils\u2019 story, concluded by stating that he has \u201cnever assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex. Period.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe details I have written about here open deep wounds for my family. But they also lead to the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cFor two years, the women with whom I had extramarital relationships have abandoned shared responsibility, and instead, shielded themselves from blame behind false allegations. They have avoided having to look a boyfriend, husband, or a child in the eye and say, \u2018I cheated.\u2019 They have done enormous damage in the process. And I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.\u201d", "description": "Matt Lauer Denies Rape Allegation in Lengthy Letter", "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oePgnwaoPxiexBWoFK.1SQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/bafeb1566ed27aa1dacb6db744a6dbc7", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
