He appealed to journalists to help the government prevent public alarm that could hurt the local hog industry.\n\nMore than 7,400 pigs have been culled in farms in villages in Rizal and Bulacan provinces that were feared to have been hit by the viral infection in recent months. The Department of Agriculture is verifying reports of infections in other areas, Dar said, but he refused to identify the areas.\n\nDespite confirmation of the infections, Philippine authorities are in control of the problem and will further tighten quarantine checks, including in airports and seaports, and crack down on smuggling of imported meat to prevent largescale outbreaks, officials said. They assured that pork supply and prices will remain normal.\n\n\u201cThe hog industry is one of the more critical industries in the country. Let us not allow it to be affected in a big way,\u201d Dar said. \u201cEverything that has to be done by government with the help of the private sector is being done.\u201d\n\nThe Philippines is the latest country to be hit by the disease, which has ravaged pig herds in Asia, with hard-hit China and Vietnam culling millions of pigs and scrambling to find a vaccine to contain infections that have ravaged their bustling swine industries.\n\nChina is home to half the world\u2019s pig population. In Vietnam alone, the virus has caused the deaths of more than 4 million pigs.\n\nAfrican swine fever is harmless to people but fatal and highly contagious for pigs, with no known cure, causing severe losses in the swine industry. The disease has been reported in China, Vietnam, Mongolia, Cambodia, Laos and North Korea.\n\nSome experts have said the current spread of swine fever is the largest known animal disease outbreak in history.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Lab tests have confirmed that African swine fever caused the deaths of pig herds in at least seven villages near Manila and a multi-agency body will be set up to ensure the highly contagious disease does not spread further, Philippine officials said Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/asia_swine_fever_57534_c0-233-3000-1982_s1770x1032.jpg?8b1f45f7234d5ef8affcc4a0fe8a1562fff9f028", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
