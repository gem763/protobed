He'd get a game for any team.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I'm not always sure he's a player who's consistent and makes the difference all the time. For the profile he's got, you're hoping he makes the difference. He doesn't always make the difference, but do I think he should stay at Manchester United ? Yes, I do.\"\n\nThere is still no word on when Pogba will make his return for United, and he was seen hobbling and using a crutch in the crowd for United's game against Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nMoyes is of the opinion that his former side need the 26-year-old back sooner rather than later if they are to turn around their poor recent form.\n\nHe added: \"I don't think he wins games like Messi does for Barceona or Ronaldo does for Juventus , but I still think hes a really talented player. He's got a lot to give.\n\n(Image: paulpogba/Instagram)\n\n\"Watching him at his best when he was at Juventus, he played a little it further forward, he got nearer the box more often.\n\n\"If you were picking the Manchester United team, Pogba would be in their midfield at the moment, that's for sure.\"", "description": "The French midfielder has long been linked with a move away from Old Trafford and hasn't played since October 30 against Arsenal", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Paulpogba Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20656904.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Arsenal-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
