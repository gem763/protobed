CANADA STOCKS-TSX climbs on U.S.-China trade truce hopes\n\nOct 10 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index gained ground on Thursday, with energy stocks leading gains, as a clutch of positive headlines on trade lifted sentiment with high-level trade negotiations between United States and China starting in Washington.\n\n* The index shrugged off a muted start and inched higher after President Donald Trump confirmed he would meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday for further trade talks, adding to optimism following a report that China was willing to reach a deal. Also helping sentiment, a U.S. Chamber of Commerce official said there is possibility of a currency agreement in u.s.-china trade talks in exchange for delay in tariff hikes.\n\n* Minister level bilateral talks resumed for the first time since July as both sides attempt to end the 15-month long trade war that has hampered global growth.\n\n* At 10:09 a.m. ET (14:09 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was up 27.58 points, or 0.17%, at 16,407.45.\n\n* The energy sector climbed 0.6%, the most among the index's 11 major sectors, on the back of oil prices which rose about 1%. O/R\n\n* A weak spot in markets was Hexo Corp , which plummeted 18.4%, as the cannabis producer withdrew its 2020 forecast, blaming an uncertain environment and slow store rollouts. That pushed the healthcare sector down 1.6%, and pressured other pot companies including Aphria Inc Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth Co down between 2.5% and 3.2%.\n\n* On the TSX, 83 issues were higher, while 137 issues declined for a 1.65-to-1 ratio to the downside, with 8.22 million shares traded.\n\n* The largest percentage gainers on the TSX were TFI International Inc , which jumped 2.9%, and Teck Resources Ltd , which rose 2.9%.\n\n* The most heavily traded shares by volume were Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd , Toronto-Dominion Bank , and Hexo Corp.\n\n* The TSX posted two new 52-week highs and one new low.\n\n* Across all Canadian issues there were eight new 52-week highs and six new lows, with total volume of 14.92 million shares.", "description": "TSX climbs on U.S.-China trade truce hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECAG0T8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
