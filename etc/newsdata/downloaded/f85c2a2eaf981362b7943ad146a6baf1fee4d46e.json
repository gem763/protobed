Bernie Sanders leading the field in this first-in-the-nation primary state.\n\nSanders, a self-described Democratic socialist who's making his second bid for the presidency, has the support of 29 percent of likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State, according to a Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald Poll released Wednesday.\n\nSANDERS, WARREN, AVOID DIRECT ATTACKS DURING DUELING EVENTS IN NH\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, long the frontrunner in most national and early-state polls, stands at 21 percent in this poll. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of neighboring Massachusetts, who, like Sanders, is a progressive standard-bearer in the field of White House hopefuls, registered at 17 percent in the poll.\n\nIn a conference call with Fox News and other national news organizations last week, the Biden campaign seemed to downplay the former vice president\u2019s expectations in New Hampshire as well as Iowa, the state that kicks off the nominating calendar. Biden senior advisers pointed to the geographic advantages both Sanders and Warren enjoy in New Hampshire.\n\nBIDEN ADVISERS DOWNPLAY EXPECTATIONS IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nThe latest poll puts Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 6 percent support, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang both at 5 percent, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 3 percent, and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas at 2 percent. Every other candidate mentioned in the survey registered at 1 percent or less.\n\nThe poll was conducted Sept. 4-10, both before and after the New Hampshire Democratic Party\u2019s annual convention. The confab, held on Saturday in Manchester, attracted 19 of the 20 remaining candidates in the nomination race. The survey\u2019s release also came on the eve of Thursday\u2019s third-round Democratic nomination debate, which is being held in Houston.\n\nThe poll sampled 425 likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State. The survey\u2019s sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.\n\nTHE LATEST POLLS FROM FOX NEWS\n\nThose questioned were also asked if they prefer the leadership of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or desire the \u2018more progressive\u2019 brand of politics exhibited by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a freshman lawmaker from New York who\u2019s become a favorite of many far-left Democrats.\n\nThirty-four percent said Ocasio-Cortez, with 30 percent choosing Pelosi, 19 percent saying neither and 17 percent unsure.", "description": "A new poll of New Hampshire Democratic\u00a0voters shows Vermont\u00a0Sen.
