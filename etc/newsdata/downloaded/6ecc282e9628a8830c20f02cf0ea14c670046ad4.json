Sidelined by an injured flexor near his right elbow, Hicks pinch hit for starting left fielder Cameron Maybin and grounded out leading off the 10th inning, then moved to center.\n\nBrett Gardner moved from center and replaced Stanton in left.\n\nLimited by injuries to 18 games during the regular season, Stanton homered in the opener and missed Game 2 because of a strained right quadriceps. Manager Aaron Boone says Stanton is available to pinch hit.\n\nFirst baseman DJ LeMahieu was leading off Wednesday's game, followed by right fielder Aaron Judge, Gardner in left, designated hitter Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n, second baseman Gleyber Torres, shortstop Didi Gregorius, catcher Gary S\u00e1nchez, third baseman Gio Urshela and Hicks in center. Luis Severino is on the mound.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
