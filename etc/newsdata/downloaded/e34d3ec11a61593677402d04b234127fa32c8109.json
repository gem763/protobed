They typically have higher poverty rates, lower Social Security benefits, and less saved in 401(k)s. But women do have a leg up on one aspect of retirement: When buying an income annuity through a workplace retirement plan, they can expect higher benefits relative to their male counterparts.\n\nMore In Wealth Management Why Most Annuities Aren\u2019t Inflation-Adjusted (and Why That\u2019s a Problem)\n\nThe Tax Benefits of a Partial Roth Conversion\n\nWhy I Kicked My College Graduate Out of the House\n\nThe Problem With Bonds in a Retirement Portfolio\n\nGot a Raise? Here's How Much of It You Need to Save for Retirement\n\nThe benefit\u2019s origins trace back to a 1983 Supreme Court case regarding employers offering male and female workers different pension benefits based on their life expectancies. The Supreme Court ruled that, as a form of sex discrimination, differential pension payments by gender violated the Civil Rights Act\u2014meaning that companies had to offer men and women identical pension benefits. By extension, annuities purchased within employer plans were also subject to the same gender-neutral pricing.\n\nIn practice, this unisex-pricing standard is a boost for women due to substantially longer life expectancy: A 65-year old woman can expect to live, on average, about three years longer than a man of the same age. And since more years of life mean extra annuity payments, women can expect to get a lot more from their annuity over a lifetime.\n\nTo get the pricing benefit, women must buy an annuity within a workplace retirement account\u2014such as a 401(k). Women who can\u2019t buy an annuity through a workplace will have to go to the individual market\u2014a term for annuities purchased outside of an employer plan\u2014where insurers can generally charge different prices to men and women. (Currently, only Massachusetts and Montana require unisex annuity pricing outside of workplace plans; all other states allow annuity prices to vary by gender.)\n\nHow much is this unisex pricing requirement worth?\n\nTo get a sense, it\u2019s helpful to compare annuity quotes in the individual market. Quotes from immediateannuities.com, for instance, show that, on average, a $100,000 policy for a 65-year-old women yields $505 a month in income, compared to $532 for a man of the same age\u2014a difference of about $325 a year. It\u2019s not nearly enough to equalize discrepancies between men\u2019s and women\u2019s retirement prospects, but the extra amount\u2014nearly $7,000 across retirement for a 65-year old woman living an average lifespan\u2014can certainly help.\n\nUnfortunately, opportunities to buy an annuity within a 401(k)-type account are still rare. A 2017 survey Deloitte found that just 6% of 401(k)-type accounts offered an income annuity.\n\nThis could rise in the near future, though, as pending legislation in Congress may increase the prevalence of annuity offerings in retirement plans. And more opportunities to buy income annuities within 401(k) plans mean more opportunities for women to cash in on this price advantage.\n\nThis benefit is far from a panacea; modestly higher annuity benefits won\u2019t cure the struggles many women face in retirement. But at least it\u2019s a start.\n\nWrite to Benjamin Harris at reports@wsj.com.\n\nRead the latest Wealth Management report.", "description": "Annuities purchased within employer plans are subject to gender-neutral pricing, says WSJ Wealth Management Expert Benjamin Harris.", "authors": ["Benjamin Harris"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FG894_annuit_P_20191022141946.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
