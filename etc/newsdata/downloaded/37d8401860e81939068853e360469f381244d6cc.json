A stark reminder that most pet toys aren\u2019t safe and should only be used supervised and with interaction,' one said.\n\n'Tennis balls are another common mistake with dogs toys.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Our staffy has destroyed endless puppy toys I thought were indestructible. Worth spending the money and getting better quality.'\n\nA third noted: 'Even rope toys can do a lot of damage, the fibres come loose they can get lodge in throat and finally swallowed and can lead to a bowel and stomach blockage.'\n\nMs Mabey said her puppy is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nBut some rushed to Kmart's defence and said it was the owner's responsibility to keep an eye on their pets.\n\n'No toys without supervision sorry but no toy will last and this really isn't Kmart's fault. I believe they have warning labels that say don't leave them unsupervised,' one user wrote.\n\n'I believe she wasn't blaming Kmart, just giving a word of warning. If you can supervise a dog 24/7 without letting it out of your sight or sneaking something chewable props to you,' another wrote.\n\nOne added: 'It's not the toy's fault your dog ate it. Keep a closer eye on your dog.'\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Kmart for comment.", "description": "Leah Mabey, from Christchurch, New Zealand, said her 10-month-old Pomeranian swallowed part of the toy and needed bowel surgery.", "authors": ["Paula Ahillon For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/07/19979220-0-image-a-2_1571641010428.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
