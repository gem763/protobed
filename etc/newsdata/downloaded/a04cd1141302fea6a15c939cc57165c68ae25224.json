Get it? It\u2019s not really that complicated.\n\nJPMorgan strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas points out that since Monday, momentum stocks have sold off a startling 10%. But the rotation out of the usually volatile sector actually began earlier this month.\n\nSince September 1, some of the most surprising selloffs have come from high beta tech serve plays like Netflix (NFLX) (-2%), Crowdstrike (CRWD) (-14%), Okta (OKTA) (-15%) and Salesforce (CRM) (-2%). The iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF \u2014 which tracks the performance of U.S.-focused momentum stocks \u2014 has dropped 0.1% in September compared to 3%-plus gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500.\n\nDuring the rotation this week alone, value stocks \u2014 often seen as such due to their rich dividends, low price-to-earnings ratios and general stability versus the broad market \u2014have tacked on an impressive 7%.\n\n.

The thesis: Value became so unloved during a summer of escalating trade war headlines, there is more value to be found headed into year end.\n\n\u201cDespite significant rotation in the last few days, there is little sign of momentum capitulation so far. Positioning remains extreme compared to the last two years based on JPMorgan Prime data, and factor valuation spreads remain close to cycle highs. The correlation between Value and Momentum is near 30-year lows, signaling extremely oversold positioning for Value,\u201d notes Lakos-Bujas.\n\nGoldman Sachs is on board with a similar call.\n\n\u201cLooking forward, for Momentum to resume its outperformance, investors will need to either return quickly to the mindset of economic deceleration and recession risk, or wait until Momentum builds again in a form appropriate for an improved economic environment,\u201d says Goldman Sachs strategist Ben Snider.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
