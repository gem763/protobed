Following her break up from Travis Scott, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was forced to deny she had met up with ex-boyfriend Tyga.\n\nShe and Travis were then been spotted co-parenting their daughter Stormi, leading to reconciliation rumours, all around the same time as a clip of her singing \"Riiiiise and Shine\" was turned into a viral meme. Yeah, it's been a lot.\n\nAnd while Kylie has clearly seen the funny side of the song, fans were left wondering whether Tyga was being shady towards his ex-girlfriend with his latest Instagram caption. \"Rise n shine,\" he wrote to his 17million followers with a picture of his tiger print sports car.\n\n\"THE CAPTION THOUGH! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\" one person commented, while another added, \"You and Kylie are up to something 'cause this getting too real now \ud83d\ude02.\" A third said, \"Tyga you did NOT,\" while a fourth said, \"Rise and shine? \ud83d\ude02 Is he trying to get Kylie\u2019s attention?\"\n\nIt's unclear what Tyga's up to. Is he being shady? Are he and Kylie on good terms? Has he been listening to the 'Rise And Shine' remix too? Who even knows.\n\nThe \u201crise and shine\u201d video came about when Kylie was giving her camera crew a tour of her Kylie Cosmetics office and went to show them Stormi\u2019s room. As Kylie flipped the lights on, she sang \u201crise and shine\u201d to an already-awake Stormi and a cameraperson who was filming from the corner. It was truly brilliant.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "He's got 'Rise and Shine' opinions", "authors": ["Dusty Baxter-Wright"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.fa4IQxUA184UdnIh1AzDw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/3dcfe112d26c353593c8828cdfb797df", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
