He said \u201cwhile many correctly point to a minor slowdown over the last week, the ability of Advance/Decline to have pushed back to new all-time highs is thought to be a positive for stock indices.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, it creates a situation where many individual names are attractive buys even if broad measures of the stock market are set to bounce along in the coming months. Newton suggests the following five stocks based on recent price movement:\n\n1). Anheuser-Busch InBev S.A (TICKER:BUD)\n\n\u201cBUD has gotten increasingly more attractive in the las couple weeks after having formed a rounding bottom formation right near its intermediate uptrend from last December\u2019s lows,\u201d Newton wrote. \u201cThis should allow for a push back higher to test recent highs and over, and the stock looks like an attractive risk/reward given this setup, with stops on longs found near $92 and targets projected higher near $110.\u201d\n\nBloomberg, Mark Newton\n\n2). Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (TICKER:WBA)\n\n\u201cThis counter-trend play looks attractive given the degree of bounce off its lows followed by just mild consolidation before last Friday\u2019s gains to multi-day closing highs on 4 times the average volume,\u201d Newton wrote. \u201cWhile the intermediate-term decline from 2015 remains very much intact, it\u2019s thought that a tactical advance is possible to at least the low to mid-$60\u2019s. Thus, Walgreens looks like a good risk/reward with momentum having turned higher. One should play long with stops at $49.31.\u201d\n\nBloomberg, Mark Newton\n\n3). Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (TICKER:BMY)\n\n\u201cBMY has been gradually emerging since late last year, breaking out of a 10 month downtrend and now recouping former lows that were made in mid-May,\u201d Newton pointed out. \u201cPrices have been trending up nicely since late July as BMY looks to have bottomed at nearly an exact time when many other stocks were peaking\u2026This looks to be an appealing candidate in a sector that is just now coming to life at a time when Technology has begun to wane. So mean reversion here looks bullish and can carry BMY up to the mid- $50s.\u201d\n\nBloomberg, Mark Newton\n\n4). ConocoPhilips(TICKER:COP)\n\n\u201cConoco\u2019s break out last week likely bodes well for additional strength, particularly given the recent turmoil in Saudi Arabia, which doesn\u2019t appear as \u201cfixed\u201d as recent reports might suggest,\u201d Newton argued. \u201cAdditional gains look likely in COP technically, given this recent improvement. Prices have broken out above the downtrend from last year, and reports are surfacing that the damage to Saudi infrastructure on an interim term basis might prove far more damaging than the tune heard in the media these days.\u201d\n\nBloomberg, Mark Newton\n\nRead more: Costly repairs to Saudi Aramco oil facilities could take months, not weeks\n\n5). Entergy Corp. (TICKER:ETR)\n\n\u201cOngoing signs of strength make ETR one to continue to favor given signs of yields starting to pull back in the last week,\u201d Newton wrote. \u201cFor now, this remains one of the better positioned utilities technically and this recent consolidation should help momentum become less overbought and provide a decent risk/reward opportunity for a push back to new highs.\u201d", "description": "Steadily improving market internals, which show the share of public stocks appreciating at year-to-date highs, give investors plenty of opportunities to make...", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO120_ABBud_ZG_20190725091319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
