While not a comprehensive list, here\u2019s one concerned American\u2019s thoughts on their seven most glaring mistakes and omissions regarding the economy.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n1. No plan\n\nLet\u2019s start with a glaring omission: No one proposed a plan to grow the economy.\n\nNot one candidate said anything like, \u201cHere\u2019s how I\u2019ll encourage American entrepreneurs to grow their businesses, creating jobs and the competition for employees that drives wage growth for working Americans.\u201d\n\nInstead, every policy proposal boiled down to dividing our economic pie into smaller pieces. Rather than proposing to grow that pie, the candidates simply assumed economic growth would continue - as if it were a given. It\u2019s not.\n\nInstead, every policy proposal boiled down to dividing our economic pie into smaller pieces. Rather than proposing to grow that pie, the candidates simply assumed economic growth would continue - as if it were a given. It\u2019s not.\n\n2. Grow the government\n\nEvery proposed solution was based on empowering government, diminishing our freedom, increasing our taxes, regulating our businesses and creating massive \u2013 unprecedented - government dependence.\n\nNo matter how benevolent they might sound, we should all be suspicious of anyone who asks us to sacrifice our freedoms, expand and empower the government and then put them in charge. Do we really trust our politicians that much?\n\n3. Middle class to pay?\n\nFor example, Medicare-for-all. Even assuming we wanted to eliminate all private insurance, could we pay for it?\n\nThe Mercatus Center, a think tank at George Mason University, \u201cconservatively\u201d found that \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d would cost taxpayers $32.6 trillion over a 10-year period, even with associated cost savings, an average of about $3.26 trillion per year.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s total revenue for fiscal year 2018 was $3.3 trillion and even that was insufficient to cover the government\u2019s existing expenses -- which totaled $4.1 trillion.\n\nNo wonder Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., refused to answer any questions about increasing taxes for the middle class. As Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., admitted, they would \u2013 and a lot.\n\n4. $9 trillion per year\n\nIn addition to Medicare-for-all, we have the Green New Deal. In addition to severe restrictions on our freedoms and an unprecedented expansion of government power, a study by The American Action Forum, co-authored by the former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, found that the GND could cost as much as $93 trillion over a ten year period. The GND includes universal health care, so we\u2019re looking at an average of about $9 trillion per year.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAgain, that\u2019s with current government revenue of $3.3 trillion that is already insufficient to cover $4.1 trillion in spending. Seriously, where do these candidates think this money will come from?\n\n5. Back to taxing the middle class -- a lot\n\nOne proposal they all support is getting rid of those pesky Trump tax cuts to increase income taxes on the wealthy. Well, in 2016 (the most recent year for which the numbers are available), taxpayers making over about $500,000 had total income of $2 trillion. So, even a 100% tax on \u201cthe wealthy\u201d would be insufficient to fund just \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d let alone the whole GND package.\n\nAnd that\u2019s assuming wealthy people would continue generating income if they had to pay it all to the government. Just an FYI, they wouldn\u2019t. That puts us back to taxing the middle class \u2013 a lot.\n\n6. Wouldn\u2019t you move?\n\nHow about an additional wealth tax on assets, as both Warren and Sanders propose?\n\nWealth taxes don\u2019t work. In 1990, there were 12 countries in Europe that had a wealth tax. Today there are three. These taxes failed because, among other things, they push people - and their wealth \u2013 to other more tax-friendly countries. They are costly to enforce, and raise little revenue.\n\nThink about it. Over 25 years, the cumulative effect of even a 2% annual tax on wealth (as Warren proposes) would result in taxes equivalent to about 40% of that wealth. If you could move to a more tax-friendly nation and keep that 40%, wouldn\u2019t you move?\n\nWealthy people can - and do.\n\n7. Working Americans left out\n\nPerhaps the crowning mistake on the debate stage last night was the failure of any candidate to acknowledge that, under President Trump\u2019s free market policies \u2013 the very policies these Democrats would reverse - things are actually going better than they have in decades for working Americans.\n\nMore Americans are employed than at any time in our nation\u2019s history, the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and the competition for employees is driving wage growth. In September, workers\u2019 wages increased 3.5% year over year, the 14th consecutive month workers\u2019 wages have been at or above 3%. Prior to this streak, workers\u2019 wages hadn\u2019t hit 3% growth since May of 2009.\n\nGiven this wage growth, and despite what you heard on the debate stage, in September the Census Bureau reported that an analysis of household income -- that considered the actual size of each household -- showed a \u201csignificant\u201d decrease in income inequality last year. The Census Bureau describes the survey supporting this finding as the \u201cleading source\u201d for national data on income and poverty.\n\nDidn\u2019t hear anything about that last night, did we?\n\nThis election is increasingly about a choice between continued economic growth and improved financial circumstances for working Americans or policies that we cannot pay for, that cannot work, and that ignore one truly American principal: Free individuals pursuing their dreams, create wealth and prosperity.\n\nBig government does not.\n\nAndy Puzder was chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants for more than 16 years, following a career as an attorney.
