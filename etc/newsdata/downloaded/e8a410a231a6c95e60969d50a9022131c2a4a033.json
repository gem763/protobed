Before she had ever stepped foot on a WNBA court, Candace Parker was dubbed the player with the potential to transcend the sport as Michael Jordan did. She was on the cover of Sports Illustrated when she was still at university, attracted sponsors such as Adidas and Gatorade as soon as she graduated and was drafted as the 2008 first pick by the Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nThen, in her inaugural season, she fulfilled every weighty expectation hefted on her 6ft 4in frame when she became the first player to receive the Rookie of the Year gong and the league\u2019s ultimate individual prize, the Most Valuable Player award, in the same season. Six months later though, everything had changed. Parker\u2019s winning smile, deemed the most marketable in US sport at that time, still beamed into the camera as she starred on the cover of ESPN magazine, but now she was cradling a large baby bump. The headline read: \u201cHow big can she get?\u201d Seven months pregnant with daughter Lailaa, a question mark was attached to Parker for the first time in her sporting life.\n\n\u201cIt was a challenge for me, I won\u2019t say that she was exactly planned but she was one of the best surprises ever,\u201d Parker, now 33, tells Telegraph Women\u2019s Sport. \u201cI had come off a great season, [but] I had a lot of people telling me that I would never be the same. I wanted to get back.\u201d\n\nTo that end, 53 days post-partum she was back on court playing for the Sparks, the first of a lifetime of games with Lailaa. \u201cWith bumps and bruises, pains, nursing at half-time... But it\u2019s made me who I am,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause she\u2019s 10\u00bd now and I\u2019ve been playing 12 seasons, I don\u2019t know basketball any more without her.\u201d\n\nParker\u2019s life as a parent came before fully establishing herself in the league, but she proved her doubters wrong and came good on her potential \u2013 as had always been the plan. Her accolades include two Olympic gold medals with Team USA, another WNBA MVP award and winning the WNBA championship with the Sparks in 2016. That same year, she was honoured in the league\u2019s definitive list of their 20 all-time best players and this season guided her injury-plagued Sparks to the play-off semi-finals.", "description": "Eleven years ago, a 21-year-old basketball player was on the cusp of a career already predicted to be legendary.", "authors": ["Molly Mcelwee", "Ben Coles", "Paul Hayward", "Mick Cleary"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/basketball/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000212508575-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqz0FILhSVaz4BDNEYZVm_8xrPpXiooEhjS6wMbsBRP0U.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
