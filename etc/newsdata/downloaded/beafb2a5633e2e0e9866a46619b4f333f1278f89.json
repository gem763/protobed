They include her original script from the film, estimated at up to $4,000, the pink gown she wore to the \u201cGrease\u201d premiere in Los Angeles, estimated at $3,000-$5,000, and a custom Pink Ladies jacket given to her by the \u201cGrease\u201d cast and crew.\n\nAlthough it took a long time to sort through her career memorabilia for the auction, making the decision to sell was easy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve realized over the years, especially when you go through stuff, that stuff isn\u2019t what\u2019s important,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt took quite a few months to weed through boxes and storage containers. But it was a fun venture. It just took a lot of time and sorting and it started out really that I was just going to auction off the \u2018Grease\u2019 jacket and pants for my cancer wellness center in Australia. And then it kind of grew out of that,\u201d she said.\n\nNewton-John said earlier this year that she was battling breast cancer for a third time since after first being diagnosed in 1992.\n\nShe helped set up the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia, which aims to support the mind as well as the body.\n\nThe auction will take place at Julien\u2019s Auctions in Beverly Hills on Saturday and a portion of the proceeds will go to the Wellness and Research Centre.", "description": "Olivia Newton-John's black leather jacket and very tight pants from \"Grease\", complete with a broken zipper, go up for auction this week as the top item in a sale to help raise money for her cancer treatment center in Australia.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446012311&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S00Y", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
