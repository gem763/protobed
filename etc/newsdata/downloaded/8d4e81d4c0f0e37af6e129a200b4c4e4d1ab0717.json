Until recently, I still had that \u2018clothes chair\u2019 that everyone seems to have in their bedrooms: the place where clothes live that are in constant rotation or that have been worn but aren\u2019t ready to be washed. I didn\u2019t want to hang anything back in the closet because I wanted to have eyes on these garments, and also, it\u2019s always an ordeal to put them on hangers at the end of the day. The pile would get higher and more precarious, crisp shirts would get wrinkled, dresses scrunched, pants lost.\n\nOn Pinterest one day, I saw something: a ladder that doubled as a place to hang clothes. Once you\u2019ve been down the Pinterest K-hole of wall ladders, with extremely specific and minute detail differences between them (wood or metal? Blonde wood or dark pine? Six rungs or five?), it may be hard to choose. It helped that I had specific parameters: Get my stuff off the ground and don\u2019t take up a lot of space doing it and don\u2019t look hideous and don\u2019t cost too much. The Yamazaki home Tower Leaning Ladder Rack fit all these rules. It leans on the wall next to my dresser, and it holds shirts I wear a lot, the three black dresses I wear again and again to work (the tower is helpful for \u2018uniform dressing\u2019), and, well, bras. Everything gets its own rung. Stuff is off the ground, off the chair, and I can see it all. The bras aren\u2019t hanging on the bedroom doorknob like I\u2019m still in college. I rotate things in and out of my closet and onto the tower as the seasons change: shorts and Eileen Fisher tanks in the summer, sweaters and wool pants in the colder months. It\u2019s \u00a348, and it hasn\u2019t fallen on me yet. I have my bedroom chair back to actually sit on (or really, to stack books on: a problem for another day). I take this as a victory.", "description": "It\u2019s like having an extra closet \u2014 that only costs \u00a350.
