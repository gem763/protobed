That's more than any Ford in history, even the $450,000 GT.\n\nThe $73,995 coupe targets Ford superfans who have been waiting six years for a new GT500, which is traditionally the top of the line Mustang.

Ford says Shelby owners often have several of the brand's models in their garages, especially trucks that they use to tow their GT500s to the track.\n\nIn the past, that was likely to be a drag strip, where the new GT500 can cover a quarter-mile in under 11 seconds, but this one was designed to go around curves quickly, too.\n\nAlong with a set of wide high-performance tires and a computer-controlled suspension, the GT500 features a racing-inspired wing and bodywork that create over five hundred pounds of downforce at high speeds to help keep it stuck to the pavement on a curvy road course.\n\nThe highly anticipated GT500 arrives at dealers this fall and not a moment too soon.\n\nThe Mustang has been the best-selling American muscle car since 2015 but was outsold in the third quarter of this year by the Dodge Challenger, which is available in 717 to 797 horsepower Hellcat models that have brought it the sort of attention Ford is hoping the Mustang will get from the GT500.\n\nGary Gastelu is the FoxNews.com automotive editor.
