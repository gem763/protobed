Now, Dutch designer Floris Schoonderbeek developed the Groundfridge, a naturally cooled, underground cellar that can be buried in any garden or backyard.\n\nAfter presenting a prototype of the underground pod at the Dutch Design Week in Eindhoven in 2015, the refrigerator has since been improved and is now officially on the market.\n\nA basic version (without any shelves installed), costs around $12,700 (9,900 euros), but if you want wooden shelves included, you will have to spend $15,400 (12,000 euros). This might seem like a large amount, but it is still cheaper than digging a cellar under your home.\n\nThe Groundfridge can be installed easily and in any setting. Groundfridge\n\nThe idea behind the Groundfridge is simple. Because it's underground, it is naturally cool due to the insulation of the soil and the cooling effects of the groundwater.\n\nRead more: Survivalists are buying underground doomsday bunkers to prep for the apocalypse. Here's what they look like\n\nA polyester dome is buried in the garden, covered with a layer of polyurethane foam and then topped with excavated soil. What's even better, is that no permit is required for the installation of the Groundfridge.\n\nThe wooden shelving costs and additional $2,300. Groundfridge\n\nThe temperature in the cellar remains stable \u2014 between 50 and 54 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 and doesn't require any connection to electricity. However, there is a cooling system with a battery that allows cool air in at night. The ventilation tube for this is \u2014 very cleverly \u2014 already incorporated into the pod.\n\nInside the fridge, there are 660 gallons (3,000 liters) of storage. That is equivalent to about 20 refrigerators and enough space to store about 600 bottles of wine.\n\nRead more: The best food storage containers you can buy\n\nThe company has already received requests from people in California, where people want to use it as an air-raid shelter in case of forest fires. Groundfridge\n\nThe wooden shelves are designed specifically for the Groundfridge and cost an additional $2,300 (2,100 euros).\n\nWhile Groundfridge is ideal for those who have a vegetable garden or are avid collectors of wine, the company is also targeting a group of people who want the pod for very different reasons. It has already received requests from buyers in California, who want to use it as a shelter in case of forest fires.\n\nThe company has already received twelve orders, says an employee, with the most interest coming from the Netherlands.", "description": "Since the Groundfridge is underground, it is naturally cold due to the insulation of the soil and the cooling effects of the groundwater.", "authors": ["Herwin Thole", "Sophia Ankel", "Business Insider Nederland"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db06992cc4a0a7cf8004c77?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
