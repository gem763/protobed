In that instance PwC performed prohibited non-audit services for its audit client. The SEC also charged PwC partner Brandon Sprankle with causing the firm's independence violations. PwC and Sprankle have agreed to settle the charges and PwC will pay over $7.9 million in monetary relief. PwC and Sprankle neither admitted nor denied they violated the SEC's auditor independence rules by performing prohibited non-audit services during an audit engagement, including exercising decision-making authority in the design and implementation of software relating to an audit client's financial reporting, and engaging in management functions. In connection with performing non-audit services for 15 SEC-registered audit clients, the SEC alleged PwC violated Public Company Accounting Oversight Board rules that require an auditor to describe in writing to the audit committee the scope of work, discuss with the audit committee the potential effects of the work on independence, and document the substance of the independence discussion. PwC and Sprankle allegedly violated the auditor independence provisions of the federal securities laws and, as a result, caused one audit client to violate its obligation to have its financial statements audited by independent public accountants. Those actions resulted in the alleged improper professional conduct. Sprankle agreed to pay a civil money penalty of $25,000, and to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission, with a right to reapply for reinstatement after four years. PwC also agreed to review its current quality controls for complying with auditor independence requirements for non-audit services and for evaluating its provision of non-audit services.", "description": "The Securities and Exchange Commission settled charges with global accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on Monday for improper professional conduct in...", "authors": ["Francine Mckenna"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
