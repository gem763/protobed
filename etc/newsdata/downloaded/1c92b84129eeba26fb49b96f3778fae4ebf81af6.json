But prices have since pared most of those gains on assurances from the kingdom that it would restore lost production by the end of this month.\n\nPrices, however, have kept a risk premium as geopolitical tensions in the region have escalated with the United States and Saudi Arabia blaming the attack on Iran. Tehran denies any involvement.\n\nThe attack has intensified a years-long struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a sometimes violent contest for influence in several flashpoints around the Middle East.\n\nA Saudi-led coalition on Friday launched a military operation north of Yemen's port city of Hodeidah while the US worked with Middle East and European nations to build a coalition to deter Iranian threats.\n\nState-owned Saudi Aramco has switched crude grades and delayed crude and oil product deliveries to customers by days after the attack severely reduced its light oil production and led to output cuts at its refineries, market sources said.\n\nWhilst showing reporters the damaged the Khurais field and the Abqaiq oil processing facility, Aramco said it was shipping equipment from the United States and Europe to rebuild the damaged facilities. It also said that Abqaiq is expected to have full capacity restored by the end of the month.\n\n\"The question is can they convince the market that they can keep their oil fields safe,\" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, in a note.\n\nIn the United States, meanwhile, flooding from Tropical Storm Imelda forced a major refinery to cut production, while a key oil pipeline, terminals and a ship channel in Texas were shut, according to sources familiar with operations.\n\nExxon Mobil shut some units at its 369,024 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont refinery while Valero Energy reduced production at its 335,000 bpd Port Arthur refinery.\n\nUS energy firms this week reduced the number of oil rigs operating for a fifth week in a row to the lowest since May 2017. Drillers cut 14 oil rigs in the week to Sept 20, bringing the total count down to 719, General Electric's Baker Hughes energy services firm said.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [NEW YORK] Oil prices eased on Friday on renewed concern over the US-China trade war, but futures still posted weekly gains, with Brent marking its biggest weekly increase since January, after an attack on Saudi Arabia's energy industry last weekend. .
