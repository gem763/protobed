The two are not related.\n\nA victory by the Fernandez ticket would mark another political swing in South America, which has seen conservative governments elected in Brazil, Colombia and Chile in recent years. Cristina Fernandez was considered part of the \u201cpink tide\u201d of leftist governments that arose in the region in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It has also propelled the candidacy of Alberto Fernandez, whose surge has sent jitters in the financial markets over a possible return to interventionist polices of Cristina Fernandez's 2007-2015 administration.\n\nMr Macri's camp has tried to capitalise on that unease, portraying her as a puppet master waiting in the wings. But the presidential candidate has dismissed those fears and voters gave him a decisive victory over Mr Macri in August primaries, which are a barometer of support for candidates ahead of the presidential election.\n\n\u201cI don't see a conflict there,\u201d Alberto Fernandez said recently in an interview with the Associated Press. \u201cArgentina's problem is not Cristina. It's what Macri has left behind.\u201d\n\nMr Fernandez served as chief of staff from 2003 to 2007 for Cristina Fernandez's predecessor and late husband, Nestor Kirchner. He remained in the position during part of her term as president but left after a conflict with farmers in 2008.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But he failed to deliver on promises to jump start the economy of the recession-hit country.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Mr Macri has pleaded for more time to reverse fortunes and reminds voters of the corruption cases facing Cristina Fernandez, who has denied any wrongdoing and remains a powerful if divisive figure in Argentina.\n\nTo avoid a runoff on 24 November, a candidate needs to win 45% of the vote, or 40% support with a 10 percentage point lead over the nearest rival. Nearly all recent surveys give Mr Fernandez more than 50% support, which would guarantee his outright victory in a first round.\n\nNearly 34 million Argentines are eligible to vote in Sunday's election. Argentines will also pick 130 lower house seats and 24 senators in Congress, as well as regional mayors, governors for three provinces and the head of government for the Argentine capital.\n\nAssociated Press", "description": "Argentina could take another sharp political turn in Sunday's presidential elections, with centre-left Peronist candidate Alberto Fernandez favoured to oust conservative incumbent Mauricio Macri amid growing frustration over the country's economic crisis.", "authors": ["Almudena Calatrava"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/27/13/alberto-fernandez.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
