Initially slated for Friday, the talks are now expected to take place early next week due to scheduling constraints, diplomats said.\n\nThe European nations consider the test a violation of UN resolutions, and pressed the US delegation to have the council take it up, one diplomat said.\n\n\"The Americans do not want a formal meeting\" so the Europeans asked for a closed-door session, said another diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who says he has a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, has shied from criticizing North Korea over its missile tests as the two sides seek an agreement for the North to give up its nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned and we need to bring this back to the Security Council. This is another clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions,\" the first diplomat said.\n\n\"This test is not neutral, and the Security Council should be able to discuss it,\" the second one said.\n\nIn late August, Britain, France and Germany sought a meeting of the Security Council after North Korea tested a new \"super large\" multiple rocket launcher.\n\nBut in the end those three members of the council simply issued a statement calling for continued international sanctions against Pyongyang.\n\nNorth Korea is under three sets of UN sanctions adopted in 2017 in an effort to force it to give up its nuclear and ballistic weapons programs.\n\nThe sanctions limit North Korea's oil imports and impose bans linked to its exports of coal, fish and textiles.\n\nSince the US-North Korea talks began, Russia and China have been calling for the UN to start lifting sanctions so as to create momentum towards the North's denuclearization.
