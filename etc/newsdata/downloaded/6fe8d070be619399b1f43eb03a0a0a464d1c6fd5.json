Unfortunately the government hasn't shown a willingness to go down that path but we are.\"\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg is weighing up a request from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for a probe into the barriers to entry for new players competing with the big four banks.\n\nLast week it was revealed the ACCC had internal concerns about political sensitivities around a new probe in the wake of the Hayne royal commission.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg said he was giving due consideration to the request but implementing the royal commission's recommendations was the best action against the banks.\n\nMr Chalmers said Treasurer Josh Frydenberg should move on the plan.\n\n\"I think it's bizarre but unfortunately not especially surprising from this government that Josh Frydenberg has refused to sign off on that, once again running a protection racket for the big four banks.\"\n\nThe new review could include banking start-ups and foreign players trying to enter the market, as well as Westpac, NAB, ANZ and the Commonwealth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They should be given the green light to do all they can to improve the banking system and make it more competitive,\" Dr Chalmers said.\n\n\"If the ACCC thinks they can make some progress on that then the treasurer should sign off on that and let them get on with the work that they are tasked to do.\"\n\nThe government and Labor have lashed the banks for not passing on last week's full interest rate cuts, with the official cash rate now a record low of 0.75 per cent.\n\n\"I certainly think that the behaviour of the banks in this instance has been indefensible,\" Dr Chalmers said.\n\nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann said the big banks should reconsider their decision not to pass on the cuts.\n\n\"It's disappointing. We would like to see the banks pass on the cut in the official cash rate in full,\" he said\n\n\"That is a very clear position the government has articulated in recent days.\n\n\"The Reserve Bank has been very clear in it's assessment. The cost of funds has significantly reduced for the banks, but ultimately the banks are private businesses and they make their own judgements.\"", "description": "Labor has opened the door to targeting the big four banks over their refusal to pass on the latest cut to official interest rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2463%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_55/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e6908b322c4f125661c86a897580fcd76ab8689f", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
