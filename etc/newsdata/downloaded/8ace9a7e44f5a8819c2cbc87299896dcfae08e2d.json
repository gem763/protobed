They would also be banned from social media and have curfews, according to news.com.au.\n\nA group of ISIS brides have pledged they would willing be placed under strict restrictions by the government if they were able to return to Australia. Pictured: Women in Al-Hawl camp Syria\n\nWomen and children would also be forced to meet strict reporting measures and not allowed to visit specific places.\n\nThe women and children are not excluded from prosecution or charges by the Australian Federal Government for any crimes they may have committed under the offer.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison, Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton received the offer earlier this week.\n\nHowever, the government has not yet responded.\n\nSarah Condon, the group's lawyer from Stary Norton Halphen, told The Australian they had proposed the restrictions.\n\n'In our view, this significant offer would allay any security concerns raised by \u00adgovernment ministers as the prim\u00adary reason not to repatriate these Australians immediately,' she said.\n\nMariam Dabboussy, who was a childcare and migrant support worker in Sydney, went to the Middle East in mid-2015 with her husband and their 18-month-old child and is part of the women promising to obey control orders\n\n'Control orders have been used \u00adeffectively in the past, imposin\u00adg significant restrictions on a \u00adperson's rights and liberties without them being charged, prosecuted and found guilty of a criminal offence.'\n\nOne woman living in the Al-Hawl camp is Mariam, whose father Kamalle Dabboussy confirmed she was in there and was part of the women working with Ms Condon.\n\nThe majority of women are from Melbourne or Sydney, it has been reported.\n\nEarlier this week Zahra Ahmed - one of the women living on 'Australia Street' - said she is afraid of losing her life in the Middle East.\n\nWho is Mariam Dabboussy? Mariam Dabboussy was not a devout Muslim but her life changed at 22 when she married Kaled Zahab (pictured). The woman who had been a childcare and migrant support worker went to the Middle East in mid-2015 with her husband and their 18-month-old child Mariam Dabboussy was not a devout Muslim, but her life changed at age 22 when she married Kaled Zahab. The woman, who had been a childcare and migrant support worker in Sydney, went to the Middle East in mid-2015 with her husband and their 18-month-old child. Ms Dabboussy travelled to Lebanon with her husband only to be 'tricked' into going to Syria, she said. It started off as a normal holiday,' Ms Dabboussy said. 'My husband had never left the country at the time. So, it was the first time he had agreed to take me overseas. 'We had a really nice holiday planned. We went to Malaysia, took me to Dubai, we went to Lebanon.' Ms Dabboussy was initially taken from Lebanon to a house in southern Turkey near the Syria border. From there, she was driven to a dusty patch of land. 'There was other people there and there was... there was a man there,' she said. 'And he started telling us, ''Run before they shoot, Run before they start shooting.'' And we didn't know what was going on.' Kamalle Dabboussy warned it could be just days before it's too late to get Mariam (pictured) and the three minors - aged one, three and five - out of Syria's Al-Hawl camp 'I looked around, I'm thinking, ''What am I going to do?'' I'm in the middle of nowhere, I don't even know where I am. There's gunshots. Now I just started running.' She didn't get far, with men bundling her into a car and taking her to a house, which had a black Islamic State flag. 'When I entered that house and I saw a flag, I saw a flag and I sort of asked around,' Ms Dabboussy said. 'Some women, they spoke very broken Arabic, they didn't really speak. They were sort of surprised I didn't know what was going on. Some of them laughed at me. The man Ms Dabboussy married is now dead, after being killed by a coalition airstrike three months later. The mother-of-three has since been forced to remarry twice more and claims life has only gotten harder.\n\nShe has already lost one of her children to malnutrition while living in the Al-Hawl camp.\n\n'The children have already experienced way too much trauma; way too many bullets. Even in the camp just the other night they had a shoot-off and the kids woke up crying. And then a few nights later it was a thunderstorm and they all thought it was shooting and they all just woke up hysterical,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n'They're starting to tell us at the shops, ''Stock up on water, stock up on flour, you don't want to get hungry''. And just hearing that, can you imagine, it's really scary.'\n\nSarah Condon, the group's lawyer from Stary Norton Halphen, told The Australian they had proposed the restrictions\n\nDespite her desperate pleas, Mr Dutton has refused to allow ISIS brides to re-enter Australia due to a terrorism risk.\n\n'It is an incredibly dangerous situation and the government has been very clear that we aren't going to put defence personnel or DFAT personnel or home affairs personnel in harm's way to provide support to these people,' Mr Dutton told 3AW.\n\n'We don't know whether they are (Australian citizens). You would need DNA testing and you'd need other checks to be made.\n\n'Some people will face arrest if they do get back to Australia because we've been able to gather enough evidence in relation to them.'\n\nMr Dutton has refused to allow ISIS brides to re-enter Australia due to a terrorism risk\n\nAhmed claimed it was 'unfair' that the Australia wasn't making efforts to rescue them.\n\n'If the Australian army can't come out to save its own Australian citizens, then what's the Australian army there for?' she said.\n\nAnother woman in the camp - Kawsar Abbas - said she fears for the health of her ten children and grandchildren as winter sets in.\n\nThe government has already stripped three people dual citizens of their Australian citizenship.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted the Department of Home Affairs for comment.", "description": "The restrictions mean that Australian women and anyone over 14 in the Al-Hawl camp in Syria would be told who they can and can't associate with, banned from social media and meet curfews.", "authors": ["Claudia Poposki", "Sahar Mourad For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/08/20209868-0-image-a-25_1572075443976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
