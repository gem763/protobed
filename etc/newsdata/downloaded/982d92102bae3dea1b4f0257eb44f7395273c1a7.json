Yesterday the President, Scott Morrison and cardboard box billionaire Anthony Pratt opened a $500 million paper plant in Ohio that Mr Pratt said would not be there if the Trump administration had not cut business taxes from 35 per cent to 21 per cent in 2017. That made American business more sharply competitive at a stroke, and encouraged Mr Pratt to invest billions in the country. And it came as the Coalition government was losing the case to lessen the burden of Australia\u2019s uncompetitive 30 per company tax \u2013 only to fret now that a lack of business capex is undermining economic growth. The second-best fallback is likely to be some sort of investment allowance in the May 2020 budget.\n\nBack 2016, large numbers of American business people put their reservations about Mr Trump to one side and voted not just for tax cuts, but against the red tape and compliance that successive US administrations had unthinkingly loaded them up with. In his first major foreign speech in Warsaw, Mr Trump became one of the few world leaders to push back against the plague of process that stifles the modern economy. \u201cThe West became great not because of paperwork and regulation,\u201d he said.
