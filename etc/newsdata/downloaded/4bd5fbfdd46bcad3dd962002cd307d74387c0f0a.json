Unlike an open auction, in which the winner only has to bid slightly more than the second-highest bidder, sealed-bid auctions can pressure buyers to make offers closer to their own upper limits.\n\nThe foundations of Democracy.com\n\nDemocracy.com was registered in the mid-1990s by Intraactive, an online business in Washington, D.C., that claimed the name on behalf of the Democratic National Committee, according to a 1997 article in the magazine In These Times.\n\nBack then, Intraactive was struggling to get rid of the domain, which the D.N.C. had never used, according to the article. But the business eventually found a buyer in John Carrieri, who said in an interview that his personal records indicated he had bought the domain name from Intraactive and that he believed the sale likely took place in or around 1998.\n\nMr. Carrieri, now the chief executive of an energy management business in San Diego, was an early investor in domains and once owned Jokes.com, which is now in the hands of Comedy Central, and Jobs.com, now owned by Monster. But while he ran those domains as businesses, he had more idealistic goals for Democracy.com.\n\n\u201cI wanted to spread democracy,\u201d said Mr. Carrieri, who majored in history and political science in college and had planned to turn the domain into an educational resource.", "description": "The domain name can be yours, for a minimum bid of $300,000.", "authors": ["Niraj Chokshi"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/multimedia/07xp-democracy/07xp-democracy-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
