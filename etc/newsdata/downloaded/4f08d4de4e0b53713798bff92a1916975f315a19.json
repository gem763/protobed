The outer sleeve of the box doubles as a playmat to use with the animal figures. We think the chocolate is a bit of an acquired taste for kids but we\u2019re not complaining \u2013 we ate the chocolates while they played with the animals! And we love that the chocolate contains no refined sugar and comes wrapped in clear film that is 100 per cent plant-based and completely home compostable.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nCarluccio\u2019s chocolate advent calendar: \u00a39.95, Carluccio\u2019s\n\nEach window of this stylish advent calendar contains a foil-wrapped milk chocolate festive character with a delicious gianduja filling.

The box eventually folds flat to reveal a snowy, festive scene, and behind each door is a MagicPoint character or a related play accessory. We had to hold our four-year-old tester back from trying to open the whole thing in one go \u2013 be warned \u2013 and keeping track of all the pieces over the month was a challenge, but it brought our tester a lot of joy. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nAquabeads advent calendar: \u00a319.99, Amazon\n\nInside this you\u2019ll find all the beads and everything you need to create 15 festive Aquabeads designs, including Santa, a snowman, a Christmas pudding and a gingerbread man.

You know what you\u2019re getting, everyone loves the chocolate, and it\u2019s seriously affordable. Buying a few of these for big households is doable, which is not the case for some of the pricier options. We think the Lego city advent calendar deserves a special mention because it\u2019s the one our three testers squabbled over the most, which tells you how much they love it.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
