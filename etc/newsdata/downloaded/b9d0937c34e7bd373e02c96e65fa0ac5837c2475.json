(Picture: HBO)\n\nThey continued: \u2018Secondly, I still find it weird that Drogon just let Jon go instead of incinerating him on the spot. We know from the Dance of Dragons and other historical events that dragons are perfectly capable of killing Targaryens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Even if Drogon intended to screw off back to Essos instead of just burning random cities down in purposeless rage, there was no reason for him to not kill Jon when he had no problem killing complete innocents who at least didn\u2019t harm Daenerys at all.\u2019\n\nGod, those are some annoyingly good points, made all the more frustrating by the fact that we\u2019ll never know the answer.\n\nConversations around Game of Thrones\u2019 controversial final season have been non-stop ever since it began in April; so much so, that a petition demanding that the eighth instalment be remade with \u2018competent writers\u2019 has been signed more than 1.7 million times. Ouch\u2026\n\nLast week, Game of Thrones director Neil Marshall, who created the pivotal episodes Blackwater and The Watchers on the Wall, told Metro.co.uk that even he would\u2019ve liked to have seen the show end a little differently.\n\n\u2018I kind of agree with a lot of the criticism that it was really rushed,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Everyone ended up where they were meant to end up but they got there in a little bit of a rush in the end.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
