Her clear, full voice powers sweeping anthems, most of which seem perfectly suited for bringing energy to momentous occasions (remember her at the 2012 Olympic Games?), but just as good for motivating everyday people trying to make it through their every day.\n\n\u201cReal Life,\u201d her third full-length album, finds the acclaimed British singer-songwriter-pianist keeping her good thing - playing motivator - going. And that\u2019s good for fans.\n\nThat much seems clear from first single \u201cSparrow,\u201d a goosebump-inducing battle cry for the overlooked and undervalued. \u201cWe\u2019ve got magic in our bones, just like the stars we\u2019re going to shine bright and golden,\u201d Sand\u00e9 sings, her voice full of resolve.\n\nShe is great on the dreamy guitar and drum-led \u201cLove to Help\u201d; endearing on album gem \u201cFree as a Bird,\u201d with its strings and soulful choir; and completely in her groove on \u201cExtraordinary Being.\u201d On that song she sings, \u201cYou are what God imagined. You are a true perfection. Baby you\u2019re made of stars. Don\u2019t let nobody tell you different.\u201d\n\nIt would be difficult not to believe her.\n\nBut when Sand\u00e9 mixes her grandeur with the ordinary, the results sometimes feel mismatched. That\u2019s the case with the title track \u201cReal Life,\u201d which finds Sand\u00e9 grappling with the day-to-day challenges of maintaining a long-term relationship. The lyrics are relatable, but the addition of a church organ and gospel choir feels like overkill.\n\nStill, Sand\u00e9 rarely goes wrong, and overall \u201cReal Life\u201d is another solid album.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Emeli Sand\u00e9, \"Real Life\" (Capitol Records)", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Melanie J.
