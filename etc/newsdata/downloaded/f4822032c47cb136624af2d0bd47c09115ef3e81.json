I don\u2019t believe a word of what it says because in 2018, the network killed my #MeToo story that was being reported by MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid. Incredibly, a year after NBC botched Farrow\u2019s reporting on Harvey Weinstein, they had the audacity to do it again.\n\nIn November 2017, I told Joy about my experience of being raped by Russell Simmons in 1994. I also shared that in 2006, former Extra co-host A.J. Calloway sexually assaulted me in his car and was subsequently arrested for his crime. When Joy and I first spoke, Russell had already been accused of rape by Keri Claussen Khalighi. In fact, she appeared as a guest on the now-defunct NBC show, Megyn Kelly Today. However, I would be the first woman to allege they had been sexually assaulted by Calloway. When NBC chose to squash my story, it not only abdicated its obligation to report news, it provided cover for a man who would later be accused of serial rape and sexual assault when my story was eventually published by The Hollywood Reporter the following summer.\n\nWhen I approached Joy, I had no idea that NBC had a reputation for not breaking news about men accused of sexual assault. Therefore, I had no reason to believe my story would be derailed by the network. After going through a thorough vetting process, an on-camera interview with Joy was taped on Jan. 7, 2018. While she\u2019s a host on MSNBC, I was told that NBC was not taping it for the cable network but NBC itself, in order to get it a larger audience beyond Joy\u2019s weekend show; also, it was to be paired with a lengthy print piece written by Joy for New York magazine. I was told the TV portion was scheduled to air on Jan. 13, 2018, but I received an email the day before from Joy asking me to reach out to her.\n\nWhen we spoke a few hours later, she informed me that Russell Simmons\u2019 attorney had gone ballistic and NBC was not going to air the segment, and the New York magazine story was also on hold since they were paired. She assured me the story wasn\u2019t dead, but that NBC simply needed more vetting done in order to feel comfortable with moving forward.\n\nI was disappointed, but still hopeful. As I would come to learn, my optimism was profoundly naive.\n\nOver the next several months, NBC put me through an elaborate and bizarre vetting process. I provided legal documentation, hospital bills, and over a dozen corroborating witnesses. Still, they stonewalled. I asked Joy repeatedly if NBC was going to do to her what it did to Ronan, and she said that she didn\u2019t think so. We both agreed that it would reflect very poorly if word got out that the network had suppressed yet another story of alleged sexual assault.\n\nTo expedite the increasingly expansive vetting process, Joy\u2019s piece was assigned to an investigative unit that was supposed to help her clear the hurdles that NBC kept throwing in front of her about my story. In mid-February, she emailed me an explanation about why it was taking NBC so long to pull the trigger:\n\n\u201cSo basically the story got caught up in a couple of vices: the struggle to get comments from the principles (now mostly alleviated), threats from Russell\u2019s lawyer that spooked NBC,\u201d Joy told me via email. \u201cSo now NBC\u2026 is demanding that I do all of this additional reporting to meet a legal and standards review.\u201d\n\nJoy then said all that was left was for her to seek comment from people in Simmons\u2019 camp who were aware of the assault, and corroboration of Calloway\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u2018Women Are Furious\u2019: NBC Roiled by Farrow Book Accusations\n\nNBC News Chief Noah Oppenheim\u2019s Harvard Writings on Women and Sexual Assault Horrify Staffers\n\nI responded to her email by thanking her for the update. I added, \u201cStill not clear why NBC is demanding more corroboration regarding A.J. [arrest]... his lawyer already confirmed the case, but I know this isn\u2019t about you.\u201d\n\nAlmost two weeks went by before Joy contacted me with an update.\n\n\u201cMy team and I, my PA and senior producer helping me with the story met with the standards department rep today just to figure out what the heck\u2019s going on,\u201d she told me by phone. \u201cI just have to get my company to have the guts to do the story,\u201d she conceded. \u201cI\u2019ve never done a story that has this much evidence before. I have more evidence than the LA Times and The New York Times stories combined. So the whole thing is, if my company will trust the evidence that I\u2019ve shown them, which is substantial, they will do the story.\u201d (Reid declined to comment on this story.)", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos GettyIn the days leading up to the publication of Catch & Kill, Ronan Farrow\u2019s blockbuster account of his dealings with NBC News, I have been struck by the company\u2019s insistence that Ronan didn\u2019t have the Harvey Weinstein story in the bag.
