On the corner of Brewer and Wardour Street, Jonathan Anderson and his team stood, armed with a blue plastic bag full of cans of lager handing out keyrings outside what\u2019s soon to be the location of Jonathan\u2019s namesake brand\u2019s new store. Behind them, on what will become the storefront, was a technicolour homoerotic mural.\n\nThe artist responsible for it, Pol Anglada, has fond memories of the day. \u201cWe hung out around the building, getting together with everyone, and then people started taking pictures in front of the kissing image,\u201d he says. With sex shops, casinos and conglomerate coffee chains on every corner, Soho\u2019s footfall is diverse. \u201cKindness and respect is a universal message,\u201d he says. The campaign reached those familiar with queer art, and those who weren\u2019t.\n\nFashion is inherently queer. You just need to revisit the last Met Gala, themed Camp: Notes on Fashion, if you need further proof, or look at the defining fashion moments of the past half decade: Louis Vuitton dabbled in harnesses; Gucci put out leather jockstraps while Moschino made t-shirts emblazoned with the Playboy logo, transforming its instantly recognisable moniker into \u2018Gayboy\u2019 instead. Fashion is becoming increasingly progressive, and queer art history is finding a place in the industry\u2019s new ecosystem.\n\nDesigners like Jonathan are putting queer art into a hugely public sphere, and in his case, it feels genuine. \u201cSince I\u2019ve known Jonathan we\u2019ve shared a passion for queer imagery and documentation \u2013 from unknown self-published fanzines and anonymous authors, to the key figures in the history of queer art,\u201d Pol explains, citing Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant, Bruce LaBruce and Peter Hujar. Like many of his queer peers, Hujar\u2019s recognition accelerated posthumously. The good news is that fashion, with its global platform and reliance on references, can spotlight those who were ignored.\n\nThis was the case with Hujars\u2019 close friend, David Wojnarowicz, known for his scathing portrayal of homosexual life in the 80s and 90s. In 2018, Anderson oversaw a Loewe \u2014 where he is also Creative Director \u2014 collaboration with Wojnarowicz\u2019s estate, resurrecting his work through a new lens. Emblazoned on a T-shirt was a collage from 1990, known informally as \u2018Untitled (One Day This Kid..)\u2019. The collage depicts a young Wojnarowicz, wrapped in columns of text not dissimilar to those of tabloids decrying homosexuals during the AIDs crisis. Typewritten is the bleak future he faces as a homosexual: electric shock, conditioning therapies and violence.\n\nGiven that violence against LGBTQ people is still a living reality, this kind of imagery is undeniably relevant. The UK, where Jonathan Anderson is based, has no shortage of issues. In June, Anderson posted a graph on Instagram showing the rise in homophobic hate crimes across the capital. Add to this what\u2019s happening in Poland, where anti-LGBTQ rhetoric intensifies, and you can see why the fashion world might be an ally. \u201cLoewe is an international brand sold in countries where homophobia is prevalent,\u201d remarks Wendy Olsoff, who represents the artist\u2019s estate. And it\u2019s in this way that fashion can spearhead progress, where perhaps art, its exclusive counterpart, cannot. \u201cWe believe that this partnership increased awareness about David\u2019s work in a way that can\u2019t be replicated by museums and galleries,\u201d she adds.\n\nBut with a wider reach comes an increased risk of exposure to ignorant communities, as evidenced in the reaction to Supreme\u2019s collaboration with Nan Goldin. The spring/summer 2018 collaboration, which spawned some pieces portraying two opulent queens Misty and Jimmy Paulette, was met with a mixed response. The collection sold slower than most other drops; comment sections on Reddit and streetwear sites were littered with trans- and homophobic comments. \u201cNan mentioned it a year or so before but I didn\u2019t realise the magnitude. I thought just a [photo for a] skateboard or something,\u201d Jimmy, now a world renowned hair stylist tells us.\n\nStill, there is good news yet. Supreme\u2019s next foray into queer art has proved less divisive. The streetwear brand\u2019s firmly rooted status amongst New York creatives brought the Chinese-American queer artist Martin Wong to grail status amongst hypebeasts. The painter, known best for his skewed representations of social realism, was a major figure in the New York art scene, before he died of an AIDS related illness in 1999. At present, Supreme hoodies bearing his famous \u20188-Ball\u2019 painting -- which had an original RRP of \u00a3156 -- are listed on Grailed at prices ranging from \u00a3385 to \u00a3648 after US to UK conversion, largely thanks to a co-sign from KAWS. \u201cKAWS came into contact with PPOW Gallery and Wong in the early 90s when he would come into our Soho space to look at Wong\u2019s paintings,\u201d Wendy Olsoff, who represents the estate of Wong, recounts. \u201cMartin\u2019s work is extremely coded and speaks to a multiple of communities.\u201d Perhaps, in being less explicitly queer, this collaboration has been better received? A depressing thought, partially alleviated by the response of his OG fan base.\n\nWhen done properly, one T-shirt design can carry more meaning than a whole collection. The genderqueer intersex artist Vaginal Davis knows this. Before collaborating with Rick Owens on an illustration for a T-shirt for Participant (a non-profit arts space), Davis and Owens had cultivated memories and a mutual understanding of what the fashion world needed more of. \u201cI modelled Rick\u2019s first collection in Los Angeles when he was selling out of Charles Gallay.\u201d Vaginal recalls her past memories with Owens, including the first time she saw his wife and creative partner Michele Lamy. \u201cShe was barracuda femme and a total top.\"\n\nDavis, whose mother inspired her drag persona, sheds light on her drawing used in the 2017 collaboration. \u201cI come from a black Creole mother born in Louisiana, whose mother was a Choctaw Indian raised on a reservation. My father was born in Mexico and his parents were German immigrants to that country. Rick and I share this mixed background,\u201d she says. The drawing she donated to the collection, a bald head connected but also separated from a dotted wig, examines her intersex, mixed-race identity and in doing so, crystallised what Owens appreciates in her.\n\nThat\u2019s what the boundary-blurring London brand Art School did for the queer sculptor Richard Porter too. Their latest collection, an homage to the late Derek Jarman, featured Porter\u2019s exquisite clay accessories, reminiscent of the shingles found in Jarman\u2019s garden. \"We love the referencing behind Richard\u2019s work, so with this season being so about the sea and Derek Jarman, it felt the right time to start collaborating,\u201d says Eden Loweth, one half of the non-binary fashion label. Considering that Loweth and design partner Tom Barratt have looked to Jarman since their graduate collection, the homage was a long time coming, even though Art School has been a stronghold for the queer community since its inception.\n\nSometimes the prestige or niche world of high fashion wards off hatred. When Raf Simons sent Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s hyper-gay imagery down the catwalk, there was no kickback. With erect dicks and a groin-fondling Mapplethorpe descending on the runway, the spring/summer 17 collection was well received. But was he preaching to the already converted? Maybe so. Still, it\u2019s a testament to progress. Less than 30 years ago, the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center was taken to trial for displaying Mapplethorpe\u2019s work. If Simons can show it on luxury clothes then hopefully fashion\u2019s trickle-down effect will work its magic on the streets.\n\nThe fashion world is bringing the work of our queer forefathers back into our consciousness. Those works find new meaning in new contexts. As David Casavant, the go-to Raf Simons archivist, notes, \u201cwhen the artist isn\u2019t alive anymore to create new work, it's interesting to re-appropriate their work, to keep it alive.\u201d Even today, in a society shaped by anti-LGBTQ rhetoric everywhere from daytime television to the Oval Office, designers like Raf, Rick and Jonathan remain dedicated to pushing a more positive representation of queer art into the mainstream \u2013 regardless of how palatable it might be to those revellers pushing through throngs of people in central London on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "From Supreme to Coach, queer art is having a moment in fashion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da5da8cb4f1b8000961bc09/lede/1571150477746-queerfashion.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
