The central allegation: In a July 25 phone call, Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business dealings of Joe Biden\u2019s son, as he was holding up U.S. aid to the country. (Though Bloomberg cast doubt on the claim that the former vice-president interfered in Ukrainian politics to aid his son Hunter, Trump could still use the story against his potential 2020 rival.) The call came to light via a complaint from an intelligence-community whistle-blower, which Trump officials initially withheld from Congress. The 9-page complaint, which was made public this week, describes Trump administration efforts to cover up what the president told he Ukrainian counterpart, and Rudy Giuliani\u2019s key role in urging Ukraine open investigations that could influence the 2020 election.\n\nHere\u2019s everything we know about Trump\u2019s Ukrainian call, his administration\u2019s attempt to conceal it, and the Democrats\u2019 impeachment push.\n\nThe latest\n\n\u2022 The declassified version of the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint was released to the public on Thursday morning.\n\n\u2022Democrats anticipate that impeachment articles could be ready by around Thanksgiving.\n\nWhat Trump said during the phone call\n\nThe White House released a limited transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky on Wednesday morning. It shows Trump repeatedly urging the Ukrainian president to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General Bill Barr to open a corruption inquiry, which Trump links to Joe Biden.\n\nAfter they exchanged pleasantries about Zelensky\u2019s recent election win, the Ukrainian president thanked Trump for previous U.S. aid (he was not yet aware that Trump had blocked $391 million in aid to Ukraine days earlier). Trump immediately shifted the conversation to investigating Democrats.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump said, going on to reference CrowdStrike, the U.S.-based technology company that investigated the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016, and former special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nLater in the conversation, Trump asked Zelensky to work with Barr and Giuliani to \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of corruption claims against Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u201d\n\nThough the document is formatted to look like a transcript of the call, it isn\u2019t a verbatim record of the conversation. Democrats called the release a \u201chighly edited memo\u201d and were skeptical that a 30-minute conversation could be fully relayed in a five-page document.\n\nTrump administration efforts to conceal the call\n\nIn the declassified complaint, the whistle-blower described the call as Trump \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in the 2020 election, and said he spoke to \u201cmultiple U.S. government officials\u201d who raised concerns about the call.\n\nThe whistle-blower said that in the days following the phone call, he \u201clearned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced \u2014 as is customary \u2014 by the White House Situation room.\u201d He noted that this indicates officials immediately \u201cunderstood the gravity\u201d of what Trump had said.\n\nOfficials told the whistle-blower that they were \u201cdirected\u201d by White House attorneys to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system where it would usually be stored. Instead it was loaded into a separate system that is used to handle especially sensitive classified information. \u201cOne White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective,\u201d the whistle-blower wrote, adding that it\u2019s unclear if any additional steps were taken, like destroying handwritten notes.\n\nThe White House confirmed on Friday that officials were told to file the Ukraine call in a different electronic system, saying National Security Council attorneys \u201cdirected that the classified document be handled appropriately.\u201d\n\nOfficials told the New York Times on Thursday that they were also ordered not to distribute the transcript of the call electronically, as is customary. Instead, they were instructed to print out copies and hand deliver them to a select group of people.\n\nRudy Giuliani\u2019s role in pushing the Biden-Ukraine story\n\nThe whistle-blower stated that in mid-May, he began hearing from multiple U.S. officials who were \u201cdeeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s circumvention of national security decision-making processes,\u201d referring to Giuliani engaging with Ukrainian officials about investigating Democrats, and relaying messages back to Trump.\n\nThe Trump camp\u2019s central claim is that Biden behaved improperly as vice-president, using his influence to demand that Kiev fire its top prosecutor, who had investigated a Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden was a board member. But in May, Bloomberg found the timeline doesn\u2019t add up: The investigation into the energy company was long dead by the time Biden began calling for the prosecutor\u2019s ouster. Plus, as New York\u2019s Jonathan Chait notes, \u201cthe prosecutor was widely considered corrupt, his sacking was consistent with the administration\u2019s pro-democracy agenda, and the Obama administration supported the investigation into Hunter Biden anyway.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Giuliani ran with the allegations, making no secret of his effort to push Ukraine into opening an investigation into Biden ahead of the 2020 election. In May, Giuliani made plans to travel to Kiev to discuss the matter with Ukrainian officials. In an interview with the New York Times at the time, the former New York City mayor openly admitted that he was pressuring the Ukrainians because it would be \u201cvery, very helpful\u201d to Trump \u2014 though some might see that as \u201cimproper\u201d:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not meddling in an election, we\u2019re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said in an interview on Thursday when asked about the parallel to the special counsel\u2019s inquiry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody could say it\u2019s improper. And this isn\u2019t foreign policy \u2014 I\u2019m asking them to do an investigation that they\u2019re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I\u2019m going to give them reasons why they shouldn\u2019t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.\u201d\n\nGiuliani eventually abandoned the Kiev visit, but in August he met with a top Ukrainian official. As Giuliani told the Times, he \u201cstrongly urged\u201d him to \u201cjust investigate the darn things,\u201d referring to Hunter Biden and Ukrainian efforts to undermine Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nWhen the whistle-blower story broke last week, Giuliani performed his typical TV routine on CNN, clashing with host Chris Cuomo and contradicting himself, claiming that he did not ask Ukraine to investigate Biden, before changing his mind about 30 seconds later.\n\nCNN's @ChrisCuomo: \"Did you ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\"@RudyGiuliani: \"Of course I did\"\n\n\n\nPresident Trump's attorney says he had spoken with a Ukrainian official about Joe Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who investigated Biden's son. pic.twitter.com/hqmqtmx2VW \u2014 Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) September 20, 2019\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr\u2019s Role\n\nThe Justice Department said Barr was unaware that Trump told Zelensky he would contact him during their call, according to the New York Times. But Democrats quickly called out Barr for prioritizing his role as a partisan before that of attorney general, and for not recusing himself from the Department of Justice\u2019s role in the whistle-blower complaint:\n\nAnother issue no one has raised: How could Barr decide DOJ, and not a Special Counsel, decides this? This is the paradigmatic case for it-involves possible wrongdoing by POTUS +now Barr himself mentioned in the \"transcript.\" SC regs wouldnt say Barr can then take case&clear Pres https://t.co/Pf8C8X7zCG \u2014 Neal Katyal (@neal_katyal) September 25, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withhold aid from Ukraine\n\nThe timing of Trump\u2019s decision to withhold almost $400 million in aid just days before speaking to the Ukrainian president suggests the possibility of a quid pro quo.\n\nTrump\u2019s response to the scandal\n\nTrump initially admitted to discussing matters related to the Biden family in a call with the Ukrainian president, citing concerns about \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place,\u201d Trump told reporters on Sunday, September 22, before the transcript was released. \u201cIt was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice-President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d He added that the exchange was \u201cperfect\u201d and involved no improper behavior.\n\nA day later, Trump suggested it\u2019s totally appropriate to withhold aid from a country because it won\u2019t investigate your political rivals. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d\n\nTrump was reportedly in favor of releasing the transcript, as he felt it proved there was nothing problematic about the call. But after the fact, this move was widely viewed as a mistake, even among many GOP lawmakers.\n\nTrump has been reusing his old claims about a Democratic \u201cWitch Hunt!\u201d on Twitter all week. During a private event on Thursday Trump lashed out at the whistle-blower, calling him \u201calmost a spy\u201d and commenting \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart, right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d He also called members of the press \u201cscum\u201d and \u201canimals.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats announce impeachment inquiry\n\nThough a majority of House Democrats had previously said Trump should be impeached, after Mueller\u2019s testimony flopped, the effort appeared to be dead in the water. The Ukraine scandal changed that in a matter of days.\n\nAt first, the story appeared to be trickling out slowly; last week confusing reports emerged about the administration withholding a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint from Congress, but the subject of the memo was unclear. The pace intensified over the weekend, as it emerged that the complaint concerned a phone call in which Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden. Impeachment talk exploded on Monday night, with at least 14 House Democrats backing a probe for the first time this week.\n\nFinally, following a Tuesday afternoon meeting with her caucus, Pelosi announced in a televised address that the impeachment inquiry was on.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cTherefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe Republican response to the scandal\n\nRepublicans have been cautious; while no congressional Republicans seem close to backing impeachment, only a few loyalists seemed eager to defend Trump.\n\nSenator Mitt Romney was the most critical of the president, calling the allegations \u201ctroubling in the extreme.\u201d Trump responded with a tweet mocking Romney for losing the presidency in 2012.\n\nIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019\n\nA day later, Romney said of impeachment, \u201cit\u2019s early to be having those conversations. There\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans, including retiring Representative Will Hurd and Senator Ben Sasse, said more explicitly that they think Trump\u2019s actions warrant further investigation \u2013 just not an impeachment investigation.\n\nOn Thursday, Vermont\u2019s Phil Scott became the first Republican governor to back the impeachment probe. Scott, who has been critical of Trump in the past, cautioned that he wants to know more before further steps are taken.\n\nThe fight over the whistle-blower complaint\n\nThe battle over the complaint that brought the story to light began on August 12, when an unidentified member of the U.S. intelligence community submitted a complaint to (Trump-appointed) Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson.\n\nAtkinson reviewed the complaint, found it to be credible and of \u201curgent concern,\u201d and, on August 26, sent it to the recently appointed acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire. Per statute, Maguire was required to report the claim to the intelligence committees in the House and Senate within a week \u2014 but he said nothing. On September 9, Atkinson wrote the committees to make them aware of the existence of the whistle-blower complaint and Maguire\u2019s failure to report it.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff wrote Maguire the next day, subpoenaing the complaint and accusing him of breaking the law. On September 13, DNI general counsel Jason Klitenic responded to Schiff, saying that after consulting with the Justice Department, they had overruled the inspector general. In their determination, the complaint was not of \u201curgent concern,\u201d as it \u201cconcerns conduct by someone outside of the Intelligence Community\u201d (i.e., the president), and it \u201cinvolves confidential and potentially privileged communications.\u201d\n\nSchiff immediately rejected this explanation, insisting that the DNI lacks the authority to overrule the inspector general. After initially defying Schiff\u2019s subpoena to supply the complaint or appear before Congress, Maguire appeared before the House Intelligence Committee in a televised hearing on Thursday, September 26. Maguire insisted he is \u201cnot partisan,\u201d and said he resisted handing over the complaint because the White House counsel\u2019s office told him it was a matter of executive privilege. He said the whistle-blower \u201cdid the right thing,\u201d and that the president pressuring a foreign government for help with a U.S. election is \u201cbad for the nation.\u201d\n\nSchiff said the whistle-blower may testify before the House Intelligence Committee in the coming days.\n\nWe have been informed by the whistleblower\u2019s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so.\n\n\n\nWe\u2018re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as this week. \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 24, 2019\n\nOn September 30, following a theory published in the Federalist, Trump claimed that whistle-blower rules were changed just before the intelligence officer submitted his complaint. To get ahead of the false idea, the intelligence community inspector general issued a rare letter debunking the concern, informing the president that the form the whistle-blower filled out has been the same since May 2018. Dispelling the GOP conspiracy that the whistle-blower was operating on \u201chearsay\u201d information, the IG also stated that they possessed \u201cdirect knowledge of certain alleged conduct.\u201d\n\nWho is the whistle-blower?\n\nThe whistle-blower has yet to be publicly identified, but according to a controversial New York Times report, the person is \u201ca CIA officer who was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity.\u201d He has since returned to the CIA.\n\nThe whistle-blower\u2019s attorneys refused to confirm these details, and said publishing them is dangerous.\n\n\u201cAny decision to report any perceived identifying information of the whistle-blower is deeply concerning and reckless, as it can place the individual in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Andrew Bakaj, his lead counsel. \u201cThe whistle-blower has a right to anonymity.\u201d\n\nCould Trump\u2019s actions \u2014 or his administration\u2019s \u2014 be illegal?\n\nTrump pressuring a foreign leader to produce dirt on a political rival could be a campaign-finance-law violation. But as former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti argued in Politico prior to the transcript\u2019s release, \u201cit is a kind of corrupt conduct that the criminal system is not equipped to handle.\u201d\n\nA bribery charge wouldn\u2019t hold up in court, Mariotti explains, because offering military aid for a foreign investigation of a political opponent\u2019s son doesn\u2019t line up with the federal bribery statute, and extortion won\u2019t hold up either, because \u201ccourts won\u2019t send presidents to prison for cajoling foreign governments to do things, even if that involves horse trading an official act by our government in exchange for an official act by someone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nMariotti makes it clear that impeachment is the only recourse designed to address a transgression of this scale. As New York\u2019s Ed Kilgore notes, the president does not have to commit a crime to be impeached:\n\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution specifically mentions \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201cbribery\u201d as grounds for impeachment, but it also stipulates that \u201cother High Crimes and Misdemeanors\u201d are sufficient. It\u2019s important to understand that when the Constitution was adopted, the term \u201cmisdemeanors\u201d had not assumed its later meaning as a type of criminal offense. According to the most common interpretation of this language, impeachment does not require the allegation of a crime, but simply some grave act or pattern of misconduct deemed by Congress as necessitating this radical remedy.\n\nHow has Biden responded?\n\nLast week, the Democratic front-runner called for the release of the president\u2019s phone-call transcript, saying \u201cIf these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.\u201d Later that day, his campaign turned the issue into a fundraising opportunity, emailing supporters:\n\nEight. That\u2019s how many times Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate me and my family. It\u2019s more clear than ever: We\u2019re in a battle for the soul of this nation. And now, I need you \u2014 right now. Can I count on you to donate tonight?\n\nOn the campaign trail in Iowa on Sunday, September 22, Biden called for an investigation into Trump\u2019s conduct, adding that he has \u201cnever spoken to [his] son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden says Pres. Trump should \"be investigated\" over conversation with Ukrainian leader allegedly asking to investigate Biden:\n\n\n\n\"He is violating every basic norm of a president.\" https://t.co/qz8DyJyvjK pic.twitter.com/2uQezkh91l \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 22, 2019\n\nIs there a Russia connection?\n\nThough it does not appear that there is a direct link to the Kremlin, the president\u2019s alleged Ukrainian meddling certainly benefits Russian interests \u2014 particularly if the July phone call had anything to do with the August slow-walking of military aid to Ukraine. And as journalist Julia Davis notes, any news cycle that makes Ukraine and the U.S. look bad is a double win for Russia, as its two foes become mired in controversy.\n\nRussia's state TV is eating up Trump's mess like candy, arguing that the White House is not only indifferent towards Ukraine's plight, but believes that Ukraine is \"occupying Russia's territory,\" emphasizing that the only thing Trump wants from Ukraine is the Biden investigation. pic.twitter.com/pcd4jfl8wK \u2014 Julia Davis (@JuliaDavisNews) September 21, 2019\n\nThis post has been updated throughout.", "description": "Reports that President Trump pushed the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, then attempted to stifle a whistle-blower complaint, sparked a formal impeachment inquiry from House Democrats.", "authors": ["Chas Danner", "Margaret Hartmann", "Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/22/trump_ukraine.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
