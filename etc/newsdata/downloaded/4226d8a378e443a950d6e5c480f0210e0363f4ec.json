REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nThe fractious British parliament refused to vote on Johnson\u2019s new Brexit withdrawal deal on Saturday, a move that forced him to seek a third postponement of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc. It has so far been envisaged for Oct. 31.\n\nAt a rare Sunday meeting of ambassadors of the 27 states that will make up the EU after Brexit, the diplomats decided to forward Johnson\u2019s deal to the European Parliament for its required approval. The EU chamber sits in Strasbourg next week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for more clarity towards the end of the week, hoping that by that time we will also see how things develop in London,\u201d one senior EU diplomat said.\n\nAnother one added the meeting was very brief: \u201cNo questions, no discussion. We are waiting.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of European Union leaders, Donald Tusk, said on Saturday he had received the extension request and he would now be consulting with EU capitals on how to react.\n\nWhile weary of the tortuous Brexit process, EU leaders are keen to avoid a disorderly no-deal Brexit and are unlikely to reject the request. They hope the deal can eventually be approved in London.\n\nAfter the British parliament refused to endorse Johnson\u2019s deal at the first time of asking on Saturday, the prime minister sent a letter to the bloc requesting a delay, as required by a law passed earlier by parliament.\n\nJohnson, who has insisted that Britain will leave on Oct. 31 come what may, added another note, however, in which he explained that he personally did not want the \u201cdeeply corrosive\u201d postponement.\n\n\u2018THE BALL IS IN WESTMINSTER\u2019\n\nA third senior EU diplomat, noting that follow-up letter, said: \u201cEither way you slice it, there\u2019s a request for an extension there\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe political ball is in Westminster. In terms of the letters that\u2019s with Donald Tusk,\u201d the diplomat added. \u201cLet\u2019s see how things pan out over the next few days.\u201d\n\nThe EU 27 have already agreed twice to postpone Brexit from the original deadline of March 29 this year.\n\nHowever, frustration has mounted among them over the distraction of a process that has dragged on for 3-1/2 years since Britons voted in a referendum to leave the EU.\n\nAfter the second extension they said it would be the last one. French President Emmanuel Macron has been the most outspoken and impatient among the 27\u2019s leaders on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe should stop believing that it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to put everything on hold for six months and everything will be better after that,\u201d French Minister for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin told French weekly newspaper Journal du Dimanche.\n\n\u201cWe need a \u2018yes\u2019 or a \u2018no\u2019 answer from Britain on #Brexit agreement. Political uncertainty has negative consequences for millions of families and businesses,\u201d she added in a tweet.\n\nHer Italian counterpart, Vincenzo Amendola, said in a tweet that since 2016 the EU had done everything necessary for an accord, \u201cwith patience and respect\u201d towards the British people and Westminster. \u201cNow it\u2019s up to the UK to clarify how to proceed to avoid further problems,\u201d he added.\n\nJohnson was obliged to send a letter asking for an extension because of a law that sought to avoid an abrupt split on Oct. 31, with an Oct. 19 deadline for parliament to either approve a divorce deal or a no-deal exit. The law demanded the government seek a delay until the end of January 2020.\n\nHowever, the EU 27 might grant a \u201ctechnical extension\u201d of just a month until the end of November to keep pressure on Britain to approve the deal clinched between Johnson and the bloc last week.\n\n\u201cA good and orderly solution is still possible if Boris Johnson now reaches out to parliament to seek a non-partisan solution. Further wrangling for power within the UK would put jobs and prosperity at risk,\u201d the tabloid BILD cited German economy minister Peter Altmaier as saying on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIf a delay of a few weeks is necessary I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it,\u201d he said.", "description": "The European Union will play for time rather than rush to decide on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's reluctant request to delay Brexit again, diplomats with the bloc said after a 15-minute meeting on Sunday.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442995823&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J098", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
