Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nNo Emmys host? No problem! Let\u2019s just invite ten cast members from Game of Thrones to present Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series. But only ten \u2026 from a show \u2026 that notably has 8 million stars. Sophie Turner, Alfie Allen, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Gwendoline Christie, Emilia Clarke, Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey, Kit Harrington, Maisie Williams, and Carice van Houten meandered onstage after an \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d for the show that dominated the Emmys for years. Is this a consolation prize because they\u2019re going to give Outstanding Drama to Killing Eve? Probably not. But at least if they win, we\u2019ll get to see the entire cast of Game of Thrones onstage and not just catch a glimpse of Isaac Hempstead Wright (the literal king we spent eight seasons waiting to crown) from his seat in the audience. One by one, the GOT cast collectively presented one award to Patricia Arquette for her work in The Act. The internet is absolutely being petty about the weird presentation, partly because we all remember the Game of Thrones final season, and partly because Bran has rights!\n\nBran is the actual winner of the Game of Thrones and they literally did not put him on the stage???? \u2014 Kate Halliwell (@katehalliwell) September 23, 2019\n\nOkay credit where it's due, saying \"television has never been this damn good\" before cutting to a shot of the final Game of Thrones season is a solid joke \u2014 Caroline Darya Framke (@carolineframke) September 23, 2019\n\n1) why didn\u2019t they let bran stand on stage?\n\n2) why do they all look like someone is forcing them to do this at gunpoint \u2014 rachel syme (@rachsyme) September 23, 2019\n\ndid my ears deceive me or did i just hear game of thrones has won 57 emmys\n\n\n\nand none have been for lena headey pic.twitter.com/aFP1h6sffh \u2014 no (@miskeencore) September 23, 2019\n\nThis Game of Thrones moment is weird lmao \u2014 Ira thee Third (@ira) September 23, 2019", "description": "The \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 cast was tasked with presenting an award at the 2019 Emmys, but they were missing quite a few stars.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/22/22-got.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
