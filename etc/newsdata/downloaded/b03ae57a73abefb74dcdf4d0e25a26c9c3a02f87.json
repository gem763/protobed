Steve Doocy suggested that President Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t really need anybody to do the talking for him\u201d because he\u2019s such a \u201cgreat communicator.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s his own best spokesperson, it\u2019s true,\u201d Trump\u2019s official spokesperson replied, pointing to Trump\u2019s helicopter-side chats with the press as evidence that he\u2019s the \u201cmost accessible\u201d president in history.\n\n\u201cIs this the new press briefing?\u201d Ainsley Earhardt asked. \u201cBefore, we saw all of his press secretaries in front of the podium.\u201d Noting that Saturday Night Live \u201cmade fun of\u201d Sean Spicer for his briefing behavior, she told Grisham, \u201cYou\u2019ll never have that moment because no longer are we doing that, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot right now,\u201d Grisham said, adding, \u201c to be honest the briefings had become a lot of theater and I think that a lot of reporters were doing it to\u2026\u201d Doocy finished her sentence for her with, \u201cget famous!\u201d Without naming names, Grisham seemed to criticize White House reporters like CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta and ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl for writing books about their experiences.\n\nWhen Brian Kilmeade asked Grisham if Trump \u201ctook it personal\u201d when reporters demanded answers in briefings with Spicer or Sanders\u2014in other words, doing their jobs by holding the administration accountable\u2014she replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s so important that the spokesperson for the president can adequately speak to his policies and get his message out there. And I think the president saw that that\u2019s not what was happening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt had become, again, theater, and they weren\u2019t being good to his people. And he doesn\u2019t like that. He\u2019s very loyal to his people, and he put a stop to it.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cFox & Friends\u201d hosts joked that Stephanie Grisham will never be mocked on SNL because she doesn\u2019t hold press briefings.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1434,w_2549,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569257132/FF_nmbsn4", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
