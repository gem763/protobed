Both Walt Disney Co. \u2019s Disney+ and Apple Inc. \u2019s TV+, are set to launch in November. HBO Max from AT&T Inc. \u2019s WarnerMedia is expected to debut next spring.\n\nAll are looking to cut into Netflix Inc. \u2019s share of the streaming market. Netflix has 60 million subscribers in the U.S. and another 91.5 million abroad.\n\nBecause Comcast is the nation\u2019s largest cable operator, it needs to balance its desire to create a consumer-friendly streaming service without undercutting its core pay-TV business or alienating other pay-TV operators that carry its various networks including NBC, CNBC, MSNBC and USA.\n\nIn an effort to navigate these choppy waters, Peacock is expected to be available free to Comcast\u2019s more than 21 million cable subscribers in the U.S. In addition, Comcast and NBCUniversal are also looking to strike deals with other American pay-TV providers that would allow them to offer Peacock to their subscribers free as well, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nNetflix\u2019s Hollywood Rivals Are Spoiling for a Fight Disney, AT&T and Comcast have plans to enter the streaming-video ring, armed with well-known TV and movie brands. But can they hold their own against industry juggernaut Netflix?

Peacock will be supported by ads but will also offer a commercial-free version at a higher price.\n\nBonnie Hammer, the NBCUniversal executive in charge of Peacock, is confident that the service will stand out against the competition even if it is one of the last to launch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody else out there can do what we can do,\u201d Ms. Hammer said, adding \u201cwe expect to have great content and a great product.\u201d Ms. Hammer also promised a superior technical product that \u201cis really easy to use.\u201d Peacock will start out with 15,000 hours worth of content, she said.\n\nLike Disney+ and AT&T\u2019s HBO Max, Peacock will include original programming as well as classic shows from its television and movie libraries. Among those who will make fresh content for Peacock are NBC late-night stars Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d mastermind Lorne Michaels. Producer Mike Schur, whose credits include \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d has agreed to make a new comedy for the service.\n\nNBCUniversal has been spending heavily to reacquire streaming rights to its shows, striking a $500 million deal earlier this year for exclusive rights to \u201cThe Office\u201d when the show\u2019s pact with Netflix expires in 2021.\n\nPeacock will also have exclusive streaming rights to \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d which is currently on Netflix.\n\nThe influx of new services will sharply increase the amount of content fighting for viewers. In 2018, there were roughly 500 original scripted shows across broadcast, cable and streaming platforms, according to data from Disney\u2019s FX Network.\n\nComcast\u2019s \u2018Peacock\u2019 streaming service will debut in April with a slate of original programming featuring stars such as Alec Baldwin.

Demi Moore will star in \u201cBrave New World,\u201d based on the Aldous Huxley novel. Producer Sam Esmail, whose credits include \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d is making a new version of \u201cBattle Star Galactica.\u201d\n\nThere will also be new versions of the NBC teen and children classics \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d and \u201cPunky Brewster.\u201d\n\nMr. Schur\u2019s new comedy, \u201cRutherford Falls,\u201d stars Ed Helms, who was on \u201cThe Office.\u201d Mr. Helms is also a co-creator of the show. Mr. Schur said the new show is better suited to a streaming service where ratings and broad appeal aren\u2019t as important as they are on traditional television.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a show I think could live on a broadcast network,\u201d he said, adding that for producers like himself, \u201cthe more places there are that make stuff, the better off you are.\u201d\n\nNBCUniversal has also made nonexclusive deals for other vintage shows including \u201cCheers,\u201d \u201cFrasier\u201d and \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond.\u201d\n\nOriginal movies will also have a significant role on Peacock. Both Universal Studios and NBCUniversal-owned DreamWorks Animation are expected to create exclusive content for the new service.\n\nPeacock will eventually be made available to Comcast\u2019s European pay-TV unit Sky, which has about 24 million subscribers.\n\nMs. Hammer said Peacock will embrace live programming as well including content from NBC News and Sports.\n\n\u201cWe want to go beyond just having a lot of shows on the service, she said. By having fresh content from NBC News as well as sports content, Peacock can be more topical and relevant, Ms. Hammer said.\n\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "description": "Comcast\u2019s new streaming service, called \u201cPeacock,\u201d will debut in April with a slate of original programming featuring stars like Alec Baldwin and Demi Moore, in addition to exclusive streaming rights to popular NBC staples.", "authors": ["Joe Flint", "Joe.Flint Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107719/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
