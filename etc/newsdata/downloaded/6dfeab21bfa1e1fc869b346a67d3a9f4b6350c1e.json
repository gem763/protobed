Her latest appeal was dismissed by the Swiss Federal Tribunal in July.\n\nSemenya, who won gold at London 2012, lives as a woman but was born intersex - making her biologically both male and female.\n\nProfessor Hirschberg, of the Department of Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, said: \u2018Ten weeks of exposure to a moderate increase in circulating testosterone caused a significant increase in aerobic running time in comparison with placebo.\u2019\n\nWHAT IS TESTOSTERONE? Testosterone is the male sex hormone and is mostly made in the testicles, but also in adrenal glands, which are near the kidneys. It causes the voice to deepen, body hair to grow and the genitals to become larger during puberty. As well as affecting sex drive and sperm production, it also plays a role in developing strong bones and muscles, and how the body distributes fat. Women also create small amounts of the hormone in the ovaries and adrenal glands, and it affects their fertility and bones and muscles. Testosterone levels which are too high or too low can cause various problems. Low testosterone in men can cause erection problems, low sex drive, infertility, weakened muscles and bones, body fat gain and hair loss. Too much testosterone, however, can trigger puberty in boys under the age of nine, is linked to aggression, and can increase the risk of prostate problems, including cancer. Male testosterone levels tend to be highest when he is around 20 years old, and decline naturally with age.\n\nThere was no such improvement in anaerobic exercise like throwing that lasts only a few seconds - or jumping and muscle strength.\n\nProfessor Hirschberg said: \u2018But lean body mass increased significantly following testosterone exposure.\u2019 The impact of the hormone has prompted controversy over whether it\u2019s fair to allow female athletes with levels in the male range to compete against women with normal amounts.\n\nThe prevalence of elite female athletes with these rare inborn conditions is believed to be around 140 times higher than in the general population.\n\nThe IAAF has stipulated they must lower levels to below 5 nmol/l to be eligible to compete in middle distance races of 400 metres to 1 mile. This policy has been widely criticised and legally challenged.\n\nIn the study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine participants were randomly assigned to 10 mg of testosterone cream or an inactive placebo for ten weeks.\n\nThe hormone\u2019s effect on aerobic performance was measured by how long they could run on a treadmill before reaching the point of exhaustion.\n\nAnaerobic performance requiring short bursts of energy was assessed in leg power on cycling machines. Muscle strength was estimated through jumps and knee power.\n\nHormone levels and body composition - the percentage of body fat and lean muscle mass - were measured at the beginning and end of the trial.\n\nAverage circulating levels of testosterone rose from 0.9 nmol/litre of blood to 4.3 nmol/l among the women given the hormone cream. No increase occurred in the group given the inactive substance.\n\nAmong those given testosterone, running time to exhaustion increased by 21.17 seconds (8.5 per cent) compared with the others.\n\nThey also had much larger changes in lean muscle mass - 923g compared to 135g overall.\n\nProfessor Hirschberg said: \u2018In sports that rely on strength and endurance, male athletes have, in general, an advantage of 10-15 per cent in comparison with female athletes, which most likely is explained by men having, on average, more than 15 times higher circulating concentrations of testosterone than women.\n\n\u2018The study supports a causal effect of testosterone in the increase in aerobic running time as well as lean mass in young, physically active women.\u2019 Semenya was subjected to a sex test in 2009 when people claimed she was a man after testing found higher than usual levels of testosterone in her blood.\n\nA normal level for healthy women is up to 1.7nmol/L, while men\u2019s is between 7.7nmol/L and 29.4nmol/L.\n\nSo athletes with what the IAAF calls \u2018differences of sexual development\u2019 which make their testosterone extraordinarily high must take medication to keep their testosterone down.\n\nThe world of sport is wrestling with the debate over whether to allow transgender competitors born as men to compete as women as it is claimed they have an unfair advantage.\n\nIn some fields transgender women, who were born as men, are dominating the sport.\n\nExamples include the Canadian Rachel McKinnon, who was born a man, but is now the UCI Women\u2019s Masters Track World Championship for the 35-44 age bracket.\n\nIn cricket, Maxine Blythin, Kent\u2019s first trans woman player is causing controversy, while she had a batting average of 15 on the men\u2019s team, in the woman\u2019s team she averages 124.", "description": "Swedish researchers found women lasted 21 seconds longer on a treadmill after receiving a dose of testosterone.
