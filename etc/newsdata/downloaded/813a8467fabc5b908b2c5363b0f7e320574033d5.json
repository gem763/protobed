He has accused Tedder of sending takedown notices claiming the song committed copyright infringement, which in turn has prevented him from collecting songwriter royalties and other payments.\n\nBrown is suing for an unspecified amount in damages.", "description": "Zac Brown has filed a federal lawsuit against OneRepublic singer Ryan Tedder over the song rights to Nowhere Left To Go, which appears on his solo studio album, The Controversy.", "authors": ["Kevin Kayhart For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/01/19565644-0-image-a-32_1570753810257.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
