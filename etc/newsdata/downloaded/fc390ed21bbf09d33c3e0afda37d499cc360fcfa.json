But why should you care?\n\nBecause if you want the strongest possible retirement portfolio this late in a bull market, you should look deeper into these trends and consider blending stocks from around the world.\n\nMost people claim foreign stocks lag U.S. shares because of Europe\u2019s lousy economy and political drama, or because of tariffs. That's an alluring story, but wrong. U.S. leadership is all about tech.\n\nStrip out tech and techlike communications stocks and U.S. stock returns closely match Europe. Through late September, U.S. stocks were up 21% year-to-date, versus Continental Europe\u2019s 16%. Exclude tech and that gap narrows \u2014 18% for the U.S. and 16% for Europe.\n\nWill debt doom America? Will our obligations bring us down?\n\nCars have a problem: They last longer, and automakers are scrambling\n\nEurope simply doesn\u2019t have enough tech to lead when tech is winning globally. About 22% of the market value of the Standard & Poor's 500 index is Tech. Only 7.5% of the MSCI Europe index, excluding the U.K., is tech.\n\nEurope doesn't have many techlike, non-tech stocks, either.\n\nIn America, many techlike stocks live in the S&P 500's new Communication Services sector. Formed last year, it blends telecom, media and entertainment. When created, it took Facebook and Google and plopped them in a category called \u201cInteractive Media & Services.\u201d\n\nNow, Communication Services is 10.5% of U.S. market capitalization. Almost half of that is tech-like. European Communication Services is only 4.5% of MSCI Europe, excluding the U.K., and nearly all of that is telecom \u2014 not at all techlike.\n\nThat difference matters. Year-to-date, America\u2019s Communication Services sector is up 24%. Europe\u2019s? Just 2%.\n\nSo target American tech and techlike names. You\u2019ll find a smattering in Consumer Discretionary (like Amazon) as well as Communication Services.\n\nAdd some American non-tech names for diversity, but get much of that outside America. How?\n\nEmphasize stock types that usually shine late in a bull market\u2019s life. Skip small, cheap companies with high dividend yields. Instead, you want \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks \u2014 firms with rising revenue and profits, brand names everyone knows, diverse product lines and huge global presence. Big, high-quality stocks.\n\nRelative to sectors and industries, those that have led this year probably keep leading for the remainder of this bull. That\u2019s how it usually works. Those that have lagged lately probably keep lagging irregularly. Here, too, look within sectors to find the best stocks.\n\nTake health care. European health care stocks are overall beating the world over the past year. But not all health care was created equal. European health care equipment & supplies are actually down, not up. So are European health care providers. The real magic is happening in European pharmaceuticals. So go shopping there.\n\nTake the same approach to consumer discretionary stocks. Avoid European automakers. They\u2019re lagging badly due to last year\u2019s emissions standards overhaul and a global auto sales slowdown. Instead, own textiles, apparel and luxury goods companies. The latter is almost half of the sector\u2019s market value in Continental Europe and is up 20.6% over the past two years. It benefits from big spending in China, India and other areas with an ascending middle class. Case in point: the luxury legend LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy \u2013 Louis Vuitton, the creation of France\u2019s richest man, Bernard Arnault. You would think it was a tech stock from its strength.\n\nEnergy should also do well down the stretch. The broad sector lags, but Europe\u2019s oil and gas drillers are very strong, outperforming global stocks\u2019 return. And they should keep humming as oil bounces around.\n\nI\u2019m less optimistic on industrials, consumer staples and utilities, but don\u2019t avoid them. Always own small positions in sectors you disfavor \u2014 a saving grace if you\u2019re wrong.\n\nKen Fisher is founder and executive chairman of Fisher Investments, author of 11 books, four of which were New York Times bestsellers, and is No. 200 on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans.
