And the Chinese government has refused years of calls for fully free elections.\n\n\u2013 \u2018One city, two masters\u2019 \u2013\n\nChina runs Hong Kong under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model that grants the hub certain liberties but ensures the city\u2019s leadership ultimately answers to Beijing.\n\nIn comments leaked last month, Lam said she \u201cserves two masters\u201d \u2014 Beijing and the Hong Kong people \u2014 and admitted she had been given \u201cvery, very, very limited\u201d room to manoeuvre when it came to solving the crisis.\n\n\u201cLacking legitimacy and the political skills that come with competitive elections, Hong Kong\u2019s governing civil servants are clearly struggling,\u201d Bland told AFP.\n\nThere was a stark illustration last week of the political rancour faced by Lam, who currently has historic low approval ratings and has refused to step down, despite saying before her appointment she would do so if she ever lost popular support.\n\nOn both Wednesday and Thursday, she was heckled by pro-democracy lawmakers during the delivery and debate of a key policy address while her Facebook Live broadcast was inundated with angry emojis.\n\n\u201cCarrie Lam is now so widely hated that her every public utterance provokes irrational anger, regardless of the content,\u201d wrote Steve Vickers, from SVA risk consultancy, in a report released prior to the speech.\n\n\u2013 Beijing\u2019s proxy \u2013\n\nThe protests were sparked by huge public anger towards a now-scrapped bill allowing extraditions to mainland China, but have since morphed into a wider pro-democracy movement rooted in fears the city\u2019s unique freedoms are eroding under Beijing\u2019s tightening grip.\n\nChina agreed to keep the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model for 50 years under the terms of Hong Kong\u2019s handover to China at the end of British colonial rule in 1997.\n\nThe city was not a democracy under the British either. But concern over the democratic deficit has only increased under Chinese rule, especially since Chinese President Xi Jinping ushered in the most authoritarian central government in a generation.\n\n\u201cThe freezing of the political system in 1997 ensures there is no popular confidence that concerns and grievances will be addressed by an effective or responsible Hong Kong government, seen widely as a proxy for Beijing,\u201d Jeffrey A. Bader, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a recent commentary.\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong government lacks the capacity, will, or trust to respond effectively to the demonstrations.\u201d\n\nBeijing has ramped up its rhetorical condemnation of the protests, portraying them as a foreign funded plot and not a popular expression of rage.\n\nBut it has so far avoided direct intervention, a strategy that analysts say is based on trying to limit damage to its international image and hoping the protests will eventually peter out.\n\nLam and her ministers are thus left with few options beyond ordering the protests to be quelled by police, who are now facing unprecedented levels of public hostility and violence.\n\nAnd while Lam and Beijing have said some economic gripes have fanned public anger, they have dismissed the idea that Hong Kongers have any legitimate political grievances.\n\n\u201cThe real issues are political and cultural,\u201d Nigel Inkster from the International Institute for Strategic Studies said in a recent video commentary.\n\n\u201cWhat it boils down to is a fear by Hong Kong of coming under a Chinese system that seems ever more authoritarian, ever more repressive. That, of course, is a problem that Beijing does not know how to address.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Paralysed by seething protesters and intransigent bosses in Beijing, Hong Kong\u2019s government lacks the power and experience", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/c2c91e_hong-kong-has-riven-by-increasingly-violent-protests-months-hands-tied-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
