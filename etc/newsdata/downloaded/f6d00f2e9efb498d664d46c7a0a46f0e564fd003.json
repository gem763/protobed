(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nColumnist\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint that launched the current impeachment controversy has now been released. It offers little new information not already in the public domain. Furthermore, if it continues to be relied upon as evidence justifying impeachment, Democrats will have to make some hard choices about how to proceed.\n\nThe complaint is broken into four parts. The first describes the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The second alleges that White House officials improperly placed records of the call in an \u201celectronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.\u201d The third recounts a series of \u201congoing concerns\u201d that relate to meetings between Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and Zelensky aides and other meetings involving U.S. and Ukrainian diplomats to discuss how to proceed or \u201cnavigate\u201d the president\u2019s requests. The fourth recounts a series of news stories and tweets regarding the president\u2019s actions and thoughts regarding Ukraine.\n\nAside from the second allegation, there is nothing new we have learned from the complaint. A rough transcript of the July 25 phone call was released Wednesday for all to read. The information in the third section is either standard operating procedure in this White House (Trump\u2019s unpredictability regularly leads foreign governments to seek guidance from administration officials on how to proceed) or reflects what we already know, that Giuliani plays an unusual and disturbing role in this matter. The fourth is simply recitation of matter already in the public domain.\n\nAs a result, Democrats now have a difficult choice to make. The wisest course of action would probably be to drop the complaint as a significant piece of evidence, since it raises almost nothing new. That would be politically embarrassing since they have made so much of it, but they could claim that the whistleblower\u2019s job has been done since it unearthed the alleged wrongdoing and placed it in the public domain.\n\nThe alternative course sets the Democrats on a dangerous path. If the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is probative of impeachment, then the whistleblower must testify to find out who gave the person the information that is described. That cannot be done without Republicans present and likely means the whistleblower\u2019s identity must be disclosed. It is one thing to keep that person\u2019s identity secret when the matter is largely handled internally; it is quite another when it is being used to try to remove the democratically elected leader of our nation. The accused must have a chance to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, and that right applies as much to Trump as it does to anyone accused of wrongdoing.\n\nInvestigation of the whistleblower\u2019s allegations also inserts the House Democrats into the deepest workings of the administration, such as the alleged discussions among White House officials to \u201clock down\u201d records of the phone call. The president would be remiss if he did not assert executive privilege over these discussions. That will inevitably present Democrats with a Hobson\u2019s choice: Either delay the impeachment hearings to fight such assertions of privilege in court or drop the matter to proceed to a vote without having all the evidence before it. Neither will help them achieve their likely aim: the swift resolution to impeach the president before the election year starts in earnest.\n\nRepublicans will surely want to probe the whistleblower\u2019s connection to his or her lead attorney, Andrew Bakaj, if the complaint remains relevant. Bakaj has worked for three Democratic senators and, curiously, once served at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. The complaint is dated Aug. 12 and alleges that the whistleblower has received facts from \u201cmore than half a dozen U.S. officials\u201d relating to the president\u2019s purported misdeeds \u201cover the past four months,\u201d i.e., since sometime in April. Bakaj donated to Democratic campaigns through Act Blue on April 26; the Washington Free Beacon reports one donation was earmarked for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. These facts could be coincidental, but don\u2019t expect Republicans and the conservative media to let them go unnoticed.\n\nRepublicans would also be wise to read the complaint carefully. The author distinguished between \u201cWhite House officials\u201d and \u201cU.S. officials.\u201d The former group are clearly political appointees, but the latter group could include career government employees. The complainant only identifies \u201cWhite House officials\u201d as sources of his information in connection with the July 25 call and subsequent alleged use of the alternate storage system. All other information the person recounts, including the \u201cfacts\u201d that started the complainant\u2019s concerns, come from \u201cU.S. officials.\u201d Expect Republicans to try to uncover who these people are, and expect the president\u2019s media defenders to allege this is further proof of the \u201cdeep-state conspiracy\u201d against Trump.\n\nThe fire this whistleblower sparked is now raging throughout the capital. In fanning those flames, the Democrats might find they can neither control the conflagration\u2019s course nor prevent the whistleblower from getting burned.\n\nRead more:\n\nGreg Sargent: The big, alarming question about Trump hovering over today\u2019s hearing\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president\n\nMax Boot: The rough transcript is devastating.
