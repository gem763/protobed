A blip on the radar in the grand scheme of things. It cost him 40,000 paying subscribers. This seemed to issue a grim warning to other streamers: Take time off at your own peril.\n\nRecently, though, it\u2019s begun to feel like that tide is starting to turn \u2014 at least if you\u2019re a big streamer with plentiful brand deals. Over the last month, Darryle \u201cHamlinz\u201d Hamlin and Daequan \u201cDaequan\u201d Loco, two popular streamers both affiliated with the major esports organisation Team SoloMid, returned to regular streaming on Twitch after months-long hiatuses. Both are hugely popular Fortnite streamers, with 2,033,637 and 3,731,074 followers, respectively.\n\nHamlin made his grand reemergence earlier this week after a near-blackout on Twitch and Twitter that had fans asking where he had been since early August. Loco, on the other hand, had stayed active on Twitter while health issues prevented him from streaming for large portions of June, July, September and October.\n\nUpon their returns, both explained to fans what they\u2019d been dealing with in YouTube videos. Hamlin said he decided to take time off when he realised that the death of his grandfather had left some wounds that still hadn\u2019t closed.\n\n\u201cThis is a little sad, but if you don\u2019t know, my grandpa passed away around nine months ago, and my grandma recently had breast cancer,\u201d Hamlin said in a video uploaded earlier this week. \u201cOnce she got breast cancer, it really fucked me up, dude, because it made me realise that I wasn\u2019t really over my grandpa. I legit couldn\u2019t say his name or think about him without crying. It was that bad. So I needed some time by myself to rekindle, get my thoughts together, get myself together. Because me, I\u2019d never lost anybody close. That was the first time I lost somebody close.\u201d\n\nHamlin said that his grandmother is \u201cgood\u201d after surgery, and he\u2019s in a much more stable place emotionally. As a result, he felt comfortable with the idea of resuming his career as a streamer, a job where you\u2019re expected to be generally enthusiastic and upbeat whenever the camera is on, which is often. Sure, the odd emotional outburst might give viewers an additional window into their favourite entertainer\u2019s world, but sustained sadness or anger are often viewed as deal-breakers.\n\nLoco, meanwhile, ran into a spate of health troubles that he continually tried to return from, only to discover that while there was a will, there simply wasn\u2019t a way. He had back problems stemming from a mixture of risky manoeuvres undertaken during high school basketball games and a life of sitting for hours on end while gaming. He believes he exacerbated those issues at the start of his streaming and video-making career, when he pulled \u201cpretty much a 16-hour day every day for eight months.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made me realise that I wasn\u2019t really over my grandpa. I legit couldn\u2019t say his name or think about him without crying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess that, combined with the sitting all the time, kinda jacked up my back,\u201d he said in a YouTube video posted last month. \u201cI had six years of being sick. Stomach pain, nausea, blurry vision, fatigue, etc \u2014 from ages 19 to 25.\u201d\n\nThis year, figuring out what exactly was wrong with him became a \u201ctop priority,\u201d but all throughout, he was also struggling with loss and other difficulties. He was sick of Fortnite. His girlfriend and editor Exie fell ill. Both his grandmothers and an aunt died, as did friends. The latter, especially, forced things into perspective, he said.\n\n\u201cTwo more of my friends passed away from gun violence that we had all escaped before,\u201d Loco said. \u201cThat really hit home. I wasn\u2019t there this time, but last time, we were all in it together. I know how it feels to be in that type of situation.\u201d\n\nLoco went on to say that he \u201cblocked it out\u201d of his mind to focus on Fortnite pro play, but that eventually took a toll. \u201cIt\u2019s like I skipped the entire grieving phase altogether,\u201d he said. \u201cI never cried. I\u2019m the type of person where, if I hyper-focus on something, I don\u2019t stop until I get it \u2014 to the point where it could literally become unhealthy.\u201d\n\nAs of September, Loco believed he was \u201cfixed up for the most part,\u201d though he was still showing \u201csome symptoms.\u201d Then he largely avoided streaming for another month, until Fortnite Chapter 2 kicked off last week.\n\nHamlin and Loco are not the only top-tier streamers to take extended hiatuses recently. Early last month, Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney \u2014 regarded by many as the biggest streamer on Twitch, especially since Blevins moved to Mixer \u2014 announced that he\u2019d be taking some time off after a tumultuous year that included a very public contract dispute with esports organisation FaZe Clan, a falling out with Fortnite duos partner Dennis \u201cCloakzy\u201d Lepore, scrutiny over his use of a racial slur, and increasing frustration with the state of his game of choice.\n\nI\u2019m the type of person where, if I hyper-focus on something, I don\u2019t stop until I get it \u2014 to the point where it could literally become unhealthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking some time off streaming,\u201d he said on Twitter early last month. \u201cI have anything I could ask for in life, but for some reason I\u2019m not happy lately. I feel trapped in a negative crawl space in my mind.\u201d\n\nTenney returned early this month and has resumed regular streaming, also largely focused around Fortnite Chapter 2.\n\nThis year also saw Guy \u201cDr Disrespect\u201d Beahm, one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, take a nearly month-long break from Twitch after he got in trouble for streaming from a public bathroom at E3 in June. After posting an awkwardly-worded apology \u201con behalf of the Dr Disrespect brand,\u201d he returned to big viewer numbers and eye-popping donations from overjoyed fans.\n\nImage: Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney\n\nThat, for the most part, has been a recurring theme across these absences: Long-awaited returns tend to be profitable ventures. Fans flock from far and wide to see their beloved parasocial BFFs fire up the old stream again, most of them seemingly forgetting any grievances they had during streamers\u2019 breaks. This leads to deluges of positive comments, donations, and re-upped subscriptions by the boatload. Do those donations make up for weeks or months of lost regular income? Probably not. But they certainly help.\n\nThe other commonality here, of course, is that all of these streamers rank among the absolute biggest fish in Twitch\u2019s pond. Undoubtedly, they have at least some money in the bank to float them through an extended break. On top of that, these days, donations and subscriptions make up only a portion of their incomes. Brand deals are now a particularly large slice of the pie, meaning that if a chunk of a streamer\u2019s subscriber base takes a hike in their absence, all hope is not lost.\n\nDeals will still pay out for things like the number of viewers who tune in while the streamer plays a particular game, and live appearance fees. Loco, for example, streamed once during September, and it was a sponsored stream for Call of Duty. Loco and Hamlin are part of TSM, and esports organisations make increasingly large portions of their income by facilitating brand deals for top-flight streamers.\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn\u2019t mean much for mid-tier or smaller streamers who don\u2019t have easy access to these resources. Being \u201con\u201d for the better portion of every day and then making videos and interacting with a community in off-hours remains a deceptively gruelling gig, and smaller streamers can\u2019t just dip, for fear of losing out on precious donations and subscriptions. But this, as exemplified by cases like Loco\u2019s, is not a sustainable lifestyle.\n\nPeople need to be able to take breaks. It\u2019s good that some streamers are finally able to, though it\u2019s disheartening that even those at the top of the food chain only did so when they reached breaking points.", "description": "Last year during E3, streaming megastar Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins took two days off from his regular schedule.
