But to be honest what we're trying, we're trying to be the adults in the room.'\n\nMeanwhile Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey has said the party's position is to go for an election as soon as the Brexit extension is granted.\n\nThe Prime Minister will table his third bid to get an early election to break the Brexit deadlock on Monday under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA).\n\nHis success is dependent on how Labour votes because the legislation requires the support of a 'super majority' of two-thirds MPs to be approved.\n\nDespite Labour MPs having been whipped to abstain on Monday's vote, it was being made clear that advice could change.\n\nIf Mr Corbyn does not back the election, it will be the third time the Opposition leader has been presented with the chance to go to the polls but declined.\n\nThe Prime Minister called on MPs to back a vote by offering them the sweetener of more time to debate his Brexit deal.\n\nHe predicted it was 'likely' an extension would be granted until the end of January, which he was compelled to request under the Benn Act forced through Parliament by MPs opposed to a no-deal.\n\nBut Mr Johnson, in a letter to the Labour leader, said Brussels may offer a shorter extension to Article 50, which he said he preferred in a dropping of his 'do or die' commitment to leave by the current October 31 deadline.\n\nBoris Johnson has laid down the gauntlet to Mr Corbyn once again, saying he will call a vote for a December 12 general election on Monday\n\nSome Labour MPs are opposed to a snap election at a time when the party is trailing the Tories in the polls.\n\nBen Bradshaw, a senior Labour backbencher, said he was not prepared to back an election.\n\n'I am certainly not falling into this trap. I think the overwhelming view of Labour MPs and Labour supporters in the country is we need a referendum first before an election,' he said.\n\nThe SNP, Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru have roundly refused to give their backing to the PM's plan.", "description": "Labour MPs were ordered to abstain from Monday's vote on a December 12 general election, but in an interview Mr Corbyn suggested he would support Mr Johnson's challenge.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/23/20157612-0-image-a-24_1571957909316.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
