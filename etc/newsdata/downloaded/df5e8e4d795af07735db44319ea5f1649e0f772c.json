But with his next novel, Sixteenth Watch, he\u2019s switching things up a bit, swapping out the swords and sorcery for spacecraft in his first novel-length science fiction work.\n\nLike Cole\u2019s other books, his next draws on his personal military experience. But instead of putting the spotlight on the usual branches of the armed forces seen in military science fiction, like the Army or Marines (or even a Space Force), it focuses on the United States Coast Guard attempting to de-escalate a potential war on the Moon between the United States and China.\n\nThe Verge recently spoke with Cole about Sixteenth Watch and his thoughts on working in a shorter format. We also got an exclusive look at the cover art, below.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nCan you tell us a little about Sixteenth Watch?\n\nEvery story, every book, has both its conceit, and it has the heart of the character beneath it. And for this one, [the conceit] is that it\u2019s the US Coast Guard attempting to de-escalate and stop the first war between the United States and China on the surface of the Moon. But from the character, human level, it\u2019s about a woman, ostensibly at the end of her professional life in her 50s, who\u2019s having to, after the loss of her husband, reinvent herself and figure out who she is and what her place is in the world.\n\nWe\u2019ve written so much about young people, right? Science fiction, fantasy is a youth-loving tradition, the bildungsroman, the origin story of the young farm boy or farm girl who\u2019s finding their way. We really don\u2019t deal enough, I think, with the fact that life doesn\u2019t stop at 30. And I really wanted to look at how older people build meaning for themselves when they have major events in their lives.\n\nThis is a new genre for you. You\u2019ve done fantasy, both epic and urban. What\u2019s the shift been like to switch to sci-fi?\n\nSo it\u2019s not new for me in that regard. It is my first novel-length work on it, and the shift has been interesting. The thing, though, that I want to point out is that the basics or the core of what makes books great, or any story great, is always character. And it\u2019s always: \u201cAre the characters interesting? Are they identifiable? Are they flawed the way real people are?\u201d And that\u2019s universal, whether you\u2019re writing about elves or an officer in the United States Coast Guard in the future. So it was transitional, in the respect that the details had to be different, right? Because I\u2019m writing about not just the military, but a future military. But the core of what makes it a story is the same.\n\nAnd I have a huge advantage when I write military science fiction, especially military science fiction about Coast Guard, in that I was a serving Coast Guard officer for many years. So for me, really, the big challenge was how to make sure that I was bringing my reader along with me and not just using a bunch of acronyms \u2014 there\u2019s a massive glossary in the back of the book to help the reader, by the way \u2014 and not just losing the reader, but having to sort of explain my terms as I go or make sure those terms are implied with context. I tried to be as relentlessly authentic as I possibly could.\n\nWhy specifically the Coast Guard in space? Why not another branch of the military, like the Air Force or the planned Space Force?\n\nRight, yeah. But that\u2019s been done to death. Oh, God. The Space Force jokes. When I put down the idea for this book, I had no idea the Space Force was ever going to be a thing. So I fully am ready to be teased to death about the Space Force, and what can I do? But I promise anyone who teases me about the Space Force is guaranteed to get a tense smile. What are you going to do?\n\nThe other four branches of the military have been done to death. There\u2019s a genre, military science fiction, and that genre is all about the other four branches of the military and space. And no one, to the best of my knowledge, has focused on the Coast Guard or a search-and-rescue element. What does their mission look like in space? And the other thing I wanted to focus on is so much of the military science fiction is, I mean, frankly, glorifying war. Or sort of dramatically emphasizing the horrors of war a la films like Platoon, you know. It\u2019s sort of taking the war movie and putting it in a science fictional context. What I loved about the Coast Guard is not only has it never been done before, but I wanted to deal with the idea of de-escalation. The idea here is a branch of the military that is trying to avoid a fight. And that\u2019s their critical role: a military branch that\u2019s dedicated to not fighting, a military branch dedicated to saving lives instead of taking them. And I thought that really added a unique spin to the genre, which I want to shout out.\n\nHow \u201chard\u201d is the science fiction here?\n\nIt\u2019s so funny. When I first started this, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do this hard of a science fiction.\u201d So Katie Mack is this famous public astrophysicist who I know on Twitter. And I always imagined Katie, like, hovering over me, wagging her finger. I live in terror of Katie reading this book and what she\u2019s going to say.\n\nSo when I first started writing the book, I met with Jack Campbell, (also known as John Hemry), who is one of my most favorite military science fiction writers. He\u2019s probably most famous for his Lost Fleet and Genesis Fleet books, and he\u2019s also a former Navy intelligence officer. We served in the same commands, so we have a good relationship. One of the things he said he was, \u201cLook, Myke, the less you go into the science, the less vulnerable you are to criticisms of getting the science wrong. So just say \u2018thrusters.\u2019 Or when I was trying to come up with this technology to keep my Marines\u2019 boots stuck to the deck, I just called them \u2018gecko boots\u2019 and didn\u2019t explain how they work.\u201d And I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s great. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nBut then in the course of doing it, my brain wouldn\u2019t do that. My brain started looking up all of this stuff. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s in the middle. I have a couple of former astrophysicists friends that I had look at the manuscript, but I definitely did go into how weapons work in gravity and the pressurization, spin gravity versus acceleration, gravity and those kinds of things. I really tried to keep it soft science, but I\u2019ve got a feeling it\u2019s probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nWhat does the title mean? Is it a military term?\n\nThe title is completely made up. So the International Space Station sees 16 sunrises in a single orbit. So I decided that the military had a colloquial expression for all space service. Of course, you don\u2019t see 16 sunrises on the Moon. In fact, you see one every two weeks. It\u2019s very different. But the military based on the International Space Station came up with the expression of \u201cgoing on the sixteenth watch,\u201d meaning you\u2019re going to serve in space. So no matter whether you\u2019re on the Moon or on the International Space Station or low Earth orbit or wherever you are, if you pulled space duty, you\u2019re on the sixteenth watch. That\u2019s the meaning of the title.", "description": "Myke Cole is best known for his fantasy work, including his military-focused urban fantasy Shadow Ops series and his more traditionally epic fantasy Sacred Throne trilogy.
