Not only are they being forced to live under an oppressive police state led by a multidimensional empire known as the Combine, but for the past five years, an unfortunate bug has left every NPC in the game unable to blink.\n\nRockPaperShotgun reports that the issue first seems to have cropped up in 2014, when Valve moved its games into its new SteamPipe content distribution system. It\u2019s such a weird little bug that one user who reported it actually dug out an Xbox 360 copy of Half-Life 2: The Orange Box to verify that the NPCs actually did blink in the original game.\n\nReports of the blinking bug first surfaced in 2014\n\nThankfully, with a patch released yesterday, the issue has now been resolved. \u201cFixed NPCs not blinking\u201d the patch notes unceremoniously read, alongside a trio of other bugs about missing sounds and saved game hitches.\n\nFive years is a long time in the Half-Life universe. In 2014, we were still seriously entertaining the idea that the third entry in the series might actually get made, before the series\u2019 longtime writer Marc Laidlaw dumped his draft for the sequel\u2019s story onto his personal blog in 2017. Nowadays, the idea of Half-Life 3 feels like just a bad joke, and even the optimistic wiki page dedicated to tracking any mention of the game\u2019s development hasn\u2019t been updated in almost a year.\n\nAt least this latest patch means we can enjoy the existing games as they were meant to be played; without having to stare into the eyes of dozens upon dozens of unblinking bystanders.", "description": "The citizens of Half-Life 2 have it pretty rough.
