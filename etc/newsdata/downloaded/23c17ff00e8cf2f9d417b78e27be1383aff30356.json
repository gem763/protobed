In each episode of Forage, he teaches us how to source in-season ingredients from our own backyards and sustainably forage them, before turning them into a delicious dish we can make and devour in our own kitchens.\n\nYou may not have noticed it underneath your feet, but if you\u2019ve spent time trekking through Canada\u2019s lush forests, you\u2019ve probably encountered some wild ginger in your path. The root \u2014 which carries the same distinct smell as the ginger you\u2019d find at the grocery store, but is much smaller in size \u2014 is commonly found in North American hardwood forests and has been harvested by indigenous people for thousands of years. In the first episode of our new series Forage, chef Shawn Adler shows us how to find it, forage it and finesse it into the perfect syrup for a big stack of pancakes. Check out the video below to learn the essentials of ethical foraging and see how it\u2019s done, then scroll down for the full Wild Ginger Syrup recipe.\n\nAnishinaabe chef Shawn Adler shows us how to harvest and utilize this powerful ingredient. 4:47\n\nWild Ginger Syrup\n\nIngredients\n\n1 bunch wild ginger\n\n2 cups white sugar\n\n6 cups cold water\n\nPreparation\n\nRinse the wild ginger under cold running water to remove dirt and debris. Roughly chop the ginger, stems and leaves included. This helps release all the flavour into the syrup. Set aside.\n\nPour sugar and water into a medium saucepan and heat on medium until the sugar has fully dissolved and begins to boil. Reduce heat to low and add the chopped wild ginger. Let steep for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally until mixture is golden.\n\nStrain the syrup through a sieve removing and discarding any remaining pieces of wild ginger. Reserve the syrup in an airtight container and refrigerate.\n\nNote: Wild ginger can be mildly harmful if prepared or consumed incorrectly. Always use water to steep the ginger as oils or alcohol can leech unwanted chemicals.", "description": "Anishinaabe chef Shawn Adler shows us how to harvest and utilize this powerful ingredient.", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294491.1569270308!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/forage.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
