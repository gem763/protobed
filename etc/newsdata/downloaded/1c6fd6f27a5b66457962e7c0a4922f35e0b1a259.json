Stories of Russian interference have been exposed as baseless propaganda and scare stories used to shut down debate. As a party of free speech, we oppose shutting down debate.\u201d\n\nFacebook has previously said it intends to comply with EU laws on data protection. The company has been contacted for comment on the resolution.", "description": "Resolution seeking upgrade of EU counter-disinformation unit nevertheless passes easily", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin", "Rafael Behr", "Pw Singer", "Emerson Brooking"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a882dc606409198e10dc579ff4adaf454eda3fe/323_256_3177_1906/master/3177.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ecd9278ffc69c7ca354299348fa1a45e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
