It's little surprise that PiS, which prides itself on its traditionalist values, sees these gatherings as electoral gold.\n\nDuring a late August festival in Kolno, a town nestled in the countryside of northeast Poland, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki tirelessly shook hands, took selfies and tried local delicacies, as the temperature soared over 30 degrees. The event was decked out with balloons emblazoned with the slogan \"500+,\" a reference to PiS's flagship program of financial handouts for families with children.\n\nWhile PiS has often fared well in the countryside, it hasn't traditionally been the only show in town. In the past, many farmers aligned with the Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL) \u2014 a grouping whose rural roots are clear in its unofficial name, the Polish Peasants Party. But PiS is trying to muscle in and secure those conservative agricultural bastions.\n\nMorawiecki explained that he came to Kolno to not only \u201cshow gratitude to Polish farmers and this year's crops\u201d but also, most importantly, to meet his voters before the general election on October 13.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very moved. We took a picture with him \u2014 he\u2019s so young, handsome and good\u201d \u2014 Pensioner Jadwiga D\u0105browska on Mateusz Morawiecki\n\n\u201cThe end of the parliamentary term is similar to harvest festivals. We present you all our \u2018crops,\u2019\u201d he said in his speech. He and other party dignitaries have taken part in countless such events.\n\nAnd the charm offensive seems to be working \u2014 at least with Jadwiga D\u0105browska, a pensioner from Rypin, a town 200 kilometers away, who came to Kolno just to see Morawiecki.\n\n\u201cHe looks so much better than in the TV, so young,\u201d she said of the 51-year-old prime minister. \u201cWe\u2019re very moved. We took a picture with him \u2014 he\u2019s so young, handsome and good.\u201d\n\nHandouts and promises\n\nIn May's European election, data from exit polls showed that farmers were attracted by PiS's promises of cash handouts for children, pigs and cows. PiS won more than 70 percent of farmers' votes, almost 20 percentage points more than in the general election of 2015.\n\nIn the general election this coming weekend, PiS is taking matters a step further. Apart from the party's promises to raise the minimum wage and hand out extra pension money, it is also venturing into highly contentious territory by promising farmers that it can boost their direct EU payments to the levels received by French and German farmers.\n\nThe question of equalizing direct payments for farmers \u2014 so-called external convergence \u2014 has been a burning political issue in Brussels for more than a decade. Those EU countries that joined the EU in 2004, including Poland, receive lower subsidies per hectare because of their lower cost of living.\n\nBut it's one thing for PiS to promise voters that it will secure east-west convergence. It's quite another to succeed.\n\nThe current plan for the next Common Agriculture Policy foresees further balancing of payments but not equilibrium. The final decision on the issue depends on EU governments, and big western players don't want to give away too much of their privilege. Even Janusz Wojciechowski, PiS\u2019s nominee to become the next agriculture commissioner, didn\u2019t commit to balance the payments fully at his hearing last week. As a veteran of EU farm policy, he knew full well how difficult full convergence would be.\n\nPeasants on the ropes\n\nPiS think they can get the job done, however. At a press conference on Monday, Morawiecki and PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski pledged that they would set up a plan to achieve the full convergence during the first 100 days of a new government.\n\nPolish farmers might be lured by PiS\u2019s promises but they also have little alternative. PSL, the party with \"peasants\" in its slogan, has shifted away from its original rural focus.\n\n\u201c[PiS] is effective in getting to this [rural] community \u2014 it\u2019s true; the fact that we lost a lot of support there \u2014 it\u2019s also true\u201d \u2014 Jaros\u0142aw Kalinowski, PSL MEP\n\n\u201cWe have been conscious that we can\u2019t be a party that would be associated with rural issues and agriculture anymore, as it would be the end of us,\u201d Jaros\u0142aw Kalinowski, current PSL MEP and former minister of agriculture and ex-leader of the party, told POLITICO. \u201cWe can\u2019t be seen as a group linked to one profession,\u201d he added, stressing that in the European election two-thirds of the party's support came from urban voters.\n\n\u201c[PiS] is effective in getting to this [rural] community \u2014 it\u2019s true; the fact that we lost a lot of support there \u2014 it\u2019s also true,\u201d Kalinowski said.\n\nHe said that many of those \"honest, good-hearted, authentic, trustworthy\" communities are bombarded with news from PiS-dominated public TV, with no access to other sources of information. \"It\u2019s backed by 500+ cash-handout programs and everyday propaganda. Then it just works, and it\u2019s very effective.\u201d\n\nIn 2007-2015, PSL was a part of the ruling coalition formed with the centrist Civic Platform, led for most of the time by Donald Tusk, now president of the European Council. The joint government was often turbulent as PSL felt that its core electorate\u2019s needs were underrepresented.\n\nOne of the main reasons why the rural community turned its back on PSL was that the PSL-Civic Platform coalition raised the retirement age to 67. In fact, a PSL minister, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, the group\u2019s current leader, carried out the reform.\n\nThe government at the time argued the measure was needed because of Poland's demographics \u2014 the country has one of the lowest birth rates in the EU \u2014 but the policy was very unpopular and PiS's promise to undo the reform helped it win the election in 2015.\n\nThis year, in the European election, PSL ran in a bigger coalition with the Civic Platform and other opposition parties. But in this week's general election, the parties decided to field separate lists, in large part because PSL feared Civic Platform's leftward drift would alienate its more conservative voters.\n\nThis fall, the party teamed up with Kukiz\u201915, a group of anti-system populists led by a former rock musician without a clear political agenda.\n\nKalinowski says it would have been be \u201crisky\u201d for PSL to run on its own, as a big chunk of its voters have turned to PiS. According to POLITICO's poll of polls, PiS has 48 percent support, while the PSL and Kukiz'15 coalition have 6 percent \u2014 just above the 5 percent threshold needed to get into parliament.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Agriculture and Food.
