Now a new breed of chefs is trying to encourage a more adventurous approach\n\nSweetmeats. Tripe. Tongue. You may not have been eating them since 1994, when the chef Fergus Henderson brought us the gospel of eating animals \u201cnose to tail\u201d via his London restaurant St John, but many have. His mantra, and his menu of lamb brains and bone marrow, spawned not only a resurgence in offal, but \u2013 more recently \u2013 an equivalent philosophy for plants: \u201croot to fruit\u201d. Carrot peel, cauliflower leaves, broccoli stems and more have been elevated from compost to plate in a drive to cut food waste that makes Josh Niland\u2019s new The Whole Fish Cookbook almost inevitable. \u201cPeople keep asking me: \u2018Why fish? Why now?\u2019 \u2013 but it\u2019s just logical,\u201d says Niland. The time to eat \u201cfin to gill\u201d is long overdue.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Whole Fish Cookbook by Josh Niland\n\nThe statistics are staggering: of an 851,984 tonne haul of fish and shellfish, Seafish UK estimates that only 43% ends up on our tables. For cod and haddock, for example, fillets make up just 50% of their whole weight; the rest \u2013 head, organs, bones \u2013 is discarded or ground into fishmeal. Outside the UK, the US and Australia, Niland\u2019s homeland, however, such discards are delicacies, prized for their flavour and nutritional value. In Iceland, fish stomachs are stuffed with cod\u2019s liver, while in Japan, steamed monkfish livers are a speciality.\n\nSpain, Scandinavia and Asian and African countries with coastlines use \u201clivers, eyeballs and sperm all the time,\u201d says Niland, \u201cbut, for me, the question was: how can I get people like my mum to enjoy them?\u201d His answer, developed over a decade of working for Australia\u2019s Stephen Hodges, Heston Blumenthal in the UK and himself at his own Sydney restaurant, Saint Peter, was to put aside convention and reconsider fishmongering as a whole.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Asian countries with coastlines often use all the parts of fish in their cooking.

The chefs and home cooks I speak to who practise it are self-taught, or inspired by less squeamish cultures. An acclaimed chef of 40 years\u2019 standing, Jeremy Lee, of Quo Vadis in London, has vivid memories of his first trips to Spain. \u201cSmoked cod roe on hot buttered toast was something we adored, growing up [in Scotland], but it wasn\u2019t until I visited Catalonia and Basque country that I saw cod tripe, hake throat and curious bits and bobs baked with potato and salsa verde.\u201d A later trip around Norway\u2019s fjords introduced him to \u201cpoached pieces of cod\u2019s liver and roe with boiled potatoes\u201d \u2013 and he was struck by the simplicity of the dish, which required only basic equipment. This Scandi speciality demonstrated just how easy it is to create something \u201cfruity and delightful\u201d from fish offal, an ease Lee emulates in Quo Vadis\u2019s fish pate (which mixes the smoked livers and hearts of herring with the meat itself) and hearty, bones-and-bits-based velout\u00e9s.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bottarga \u2013 grey mullet roe \u2013 is a Mediterranean delicacy.

Garum, a fermented fish sauce that is \u201cbasically organs, water and salt\u201d, has been around since antiquity. For much of history it was unthinkable to chuck anything edible away. \u201cIf you think about a family in the hills of Campania rearing a pig, do you think they are just going to eat the loins and fillets?\u201d Niland asks. \u201cThey\u2019re going to use everything.\u201d Joe Bloggs is unlikely to make John Dory liver terrine, or dry-age their fish as per Saint Peter, but Niland\u2019s aim with his book is mainly to encourage us to use our fishmongers better, and more. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t buy fish at the supermarket. Go specifically to somebody who is passionate about working with fish. Take my book and ask: \u2018Can you keep the bones? Leave the head on?\u2019 And they\u2019ll say: \u2018Yes \u2013 I just never saw it as marketable.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThere needs to be more demand,\u201d Lee agrees. \u201cMy local fishmonger, Fin & Flounder, has always been very amenable. I just need to call them.\u201d Not only is this environmentally sound but, if your fishmonger is anything like the food writer Sue Quinn\u2019s, it\u2019s also pounds in your pocket: \u201cGenerally, the fishmonger throws the bones and trimmings away, but I take them off his hands because it\u2019s treasure, and it\u2019s free.\u201d\n\nNiland wrote his book around species that are seasonal and native to Australia, but the principles apply elsewhere (he provides suggestions). At Ikoyi, in hake or turbot season, two or three tables a night will be treated to fish heads, the cheeks roasted into sweet nuggety morsels, the bones sticky and finger-licking good. \u201cWe buy in whole fish and feed people accordingly,\u201d Chan says. It\u2019s more interesting for both chefs and customers. This isn\u2019t necessarily a restaurant thing, says Imogen Davis, chef and co-founder of Native in London. If you have done a fish filleting course or can follow YouTube tutorials, a whole fish is \u201ca good place to start for home cooks. Fish cheeks can be used in a fish chowder, scrap bits of trim can make fishcakes and, if you batter and deep fry the collars, you can make the meatiest, most juicy fish and chips.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fish-head terrine, one of the dishes in The Whole Fish Cookbook\n\nI like the sound of the \u201ctongue in cheek\u201d ravioli suggested by Adam Handling of the Frog restaurants, for the pun as much as the zero-waste mentality. \u201cFish tongue, throat and cheeks are delicious. You don\u2019t have to do much to make them taste good,\u201d he says, of an approach to fish that is as much about \u201ccommercial sense\u201d as it is \u201csaving the planet\u201d. \u201cMy staff value the ingredients, but they also value every penny going in and out of the kitchen.\u201d\n\nFor readers balking at Niland\u2019s eyeball crackers and puffed bladders, Quinn\u2019s advice is, don\u2019t panic. \u201cThe gills-to-fin approach can be tricky for home cooks \u2013 whipping up a weeknight supper using fish scales or eyeballs just isn\u2019t going to happen in most households \u2013 but there are little things everyone can do.\u201d Her suggestion of crumbing the cheeks and frying them up \u201clike goujons\u201d seems deliciously doable, as does transforming bones and heads into soups and risottos. The journey toward fish sustainability seems long and slippery, but it can start with a single stock.\n\nThe Whole Fish Cookbook by Josh Niland is published by Hardie Grant (\u00a325)", "description": "When it comes to fish, in Britain we rarely eat anything other than fillets and discard everything else.
