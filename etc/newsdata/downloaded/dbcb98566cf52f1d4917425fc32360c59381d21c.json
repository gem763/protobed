They also chafed at suggestions the effort was designed to stamp out a trio of primary challengers, saying declared foes barely deserve mention and that Mr. Trump\u2019s GOP support is historically strong.\n\nTrump campaign officials pointed to states from coast to coast that have passed \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d rules binding their delegates to the top vote-getter in primaries \u2014 or, at least, changes that more accurately reflect the share of votes received.\n\nThey said under 2016 rules, for instance, a candidate who received only 6% of the GOP vote in Massachusetts could have amassed nearly 25% \u2014 or 10 out of 41 \u2014 delegates.\n\nNow \u201cthat will no longer be the case,\u201d a campaign official said, because the state decided to dole out its delegates more proportionately.\n\nThe campaign said a properly executed convention is the single-most important thing the GOP can do to launch Mr. Trump\u2019s sprint to November.\n\nIt wants to have Mr. Trump sparring with Democrats from Jan. 1 of the 2020 election year, rather than from Labor Day. And it wants to stave off chicanery on the floor in Charlotte, when the GOP assembles for its convention this August.\n\n\u201cWe care about ensuring a pre-determined outcome,\u201d a campaign official said.\n\nMr. Trump gave the campaign a head start on the nitty-gritty of delegate organization by announcing his reelection bid right after inauguration. He hasn\u2019t stopped campaigning since then, really, and amassed a huge fundraising head start on his potential Democratic foes.\n\nThe president is facing an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, however, and three GOP candidates have launched long-shot primary challenges \u2014 former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois and former Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina.\n\nFour states moved to cancel their GOP primaries, prompting the trio to accuse the Trump campaign of \u201cweakness.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign said the canceled primaries have been overblown, and that tightening up the delegate process is \u201ccertainly more impactful than the cancelations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rules of the party now reflect adequately the will of the voters in the president\u2019s party,\u201d a campaign official said. \u201cThis is not being done from a position of weakness.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
