REUTERS/Thaier Al-Sudani/File Photo\n\nIn a report by its Human Rights Office published late on Monday, UNAMI said there was evidence that security forces had used excessive force against protesters and made mass arrests. There were also reports that security forces had denied protesters medical treatment, it said.\n\n\u201cUNAMI\u2019s interim findings indicate that serious human rights violations and abuses have been committed in the context of the demonstrations in Iraq,\u201d the report said in its conclusion.\n\n\u201cThe number of dead, the extent and scale of injuries inflicted on demonstrators, all suggest that Iraqi security forces have used excessive force against demonstrators in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq.\u201d\n\nProtests about high unemployment, poor public services and corruption erupted on Oct. 1, prompting a violent security crackdown. Protesters blame graft and infighting among political leaders for failing to improve their lives even in peacetime, two years after Islamic State was declared defeated in Iraq.\n\nUNAMI said it conducted 145 interviews between Oct 1-16 with human rights monitors, journalists, civil society activists, protesters, family members of killed demonstrators and others.\n\nJournalists who covered the protests told UNAMI said they were subjected to arrests, threats, intimidation and harassment. Human rights activists said they received warnings and death threats not to participate in demonstrations.\n\nAn Iraqi government committee investigating the wave of unrest found that 149 civilians were killed because security forces used excessive force and live fire to quell protests, according to its report, seen by Reuters.\n\nOver 70% of deaths were caused by shots to the head or chest, and there was evidence of sniper fire targeting protesters, the government report said.\n\n\u201cThe loss of life, serious injuries and harm resulting from the violence during the demonstrations was both tragic and preventable,\u201d said Danielle Bell, UNAMI\u2019s human rights chief.\n\n\u201cConcrete steps to enable peaceful assemblies and protect those participating should be a priority.\u201d\n\nLink to UNAMI report: here", "description": "Iraqi authorities committed serious human rights violations and abuses in their response to a wave of anti-government protests earlier this month that saw 149 civilians killed, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444060020&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0P5", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
