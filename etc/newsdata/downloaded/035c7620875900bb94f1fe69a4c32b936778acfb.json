USA TODAY\n\n\u201cCatch and Kill\u201d is finally out in the world, and with it, more potentially eyebrow-raising insight into popular figures from journalist Ronan Farrow.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize winner's new book has grabbed headlines in the week leading up to its release, stirring controversy with its accusations of an alleged cover-up of sexual misconduct by NBC. Farrow claims that the network was aware of former \u201cToday\u201d anchor Matt Lauer\u2019s alleged history of sexual harassment and assault years before his 2017 firing, including the alleged rape of an ex-NBC staffer during the 2014 Sochi Olympics in Russia.\n\nRonan Farrow: NBC\u2019s alleged cover-up of sexual misconduct is \u2018bigger\u2019 than Matt Lauer\n\nLauer denied the accusations in an open letter released last week, while NBC executives have repeatedly refuted Farrow\u2019s claims that they \u201ckilled\u201d his 2017 investigation of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, also accused of multiple allegations of sexual assault.\n\nUSA TODAY sat down with Farrow, 31, to discuss \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d and asked him about some of the most notable names referenced in the book.\n\nCelebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and partner, actress Asia Argento, pictured together in April 2018.

'But I pray you have the strength to run this story.\"\n\nFarrow tells USA TODAY that Bourdain, who died of suicide last year at 61, was \"an incredibly inspiring exception\" to many partners of sexual assault victims, who are often encouraged not to come forward with their allegations.\n\nBut Bourdain told Argento, \"'You could do this and I'll stand by you if you do,'\" Farrow says. \"I met Anthony during that reporting, and I was very inspired by the way in which he stood up for what was right and was a model of what a man should be when a woman in his life is going through a struggle with whether to speak.\"\n\nMegyn Kelly on her show \"Megyn Kelly Today\" on Oct. 22, 2018, the day before controversial remarks led to the show being canceled and negotiations for her departure from NBC News.

Farrow writes that the letter was met with skepticism from some members of the media, including NBC's own Megyn Kelly, who had then recently begun hosting the third hour of \"Today.\"\n\nMatt Lauer scandal: Megyn Kelly lauds 'forces of good' Meredith Vieira and Ann Curry\n\n\"On the network's own air, Megyn Kelly questioned NBC's self-reporting, joining the calls for independent oversight,\" Farrow writes in \"Catch.\" \"Soon she'd be gone, too \u2013 fired after conflagration over a racially insensitive remark. For the network, the firing had the added benefit of cutting off what several sources around Lack said were mounting tensions over Kelly's focus on Weinstein and Lauer.\"\n\nSo is it possible that NBC saw Kelly's controversial blackface comments as a convenient excuse to fire her for criticizing the network? Regarding Kelly's ousting, Farrow tells USA TODAY, \"I won't speculate on the state of mind of the executives who were making that decision, but certainly it seems possible that \u2013 given the reporting in this book \u2013 certain executives would be unhappy with a concerted focus on that kind of reporting.\"\n\nLongtime \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Tom Brokaw in 2014. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)\n\nTom Brokaw supported Weinstein expose\n\nIn \"Catch,\" Farrow alleges that NBC higher-ups distanced themselves from him as he closed in on Weinstein but recalls having one vocal champion at the network throughout his investigation: \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Tom Brokaw, who later called NBC's alleged squashing of the story a \"self-inflicted wound,\" according to the book.\n\nBut Farrow's own friendship with Brokaw grew more complicated in 2018, months after Lauer's firing, when Brokaw was accused of unwanted sexual advances by three women in the 1960s and '90s. Brokaw denied the allegations, and continues to work as a special correspondent for NBC News.\n\n\"As with every aspect of 'Catch and Kill,' things are complicated,\" Farrow tells USA TODAY. \"The book is frank about the allegations against Tom Brokaw and the exact nature of them, and it puts them in context of cultural problems in the media industry. At the same time, it is also frank about the fact that Tom Brokaw was one of the few men at NBC News who stood by the Weinstein story, called it a 'self-inflicted wound' that they were killing it, and said it was un-journalistic. So I'll let people form their own judgments about that, but both things are true.\"\n\nHarvey Weinstein leaves court after his arraignment over a new indictment for sexual assault in August in New York. (Photo: Yana Paskova, Getty Images)\n\nHarvey Weinstein brought up Farrow's sister in interview\n\nOf course, there is no shortage of mentions of Weinstein in \"Catch,\" pertaining to his accusers and the NBC executives that Farrow alleges were both intimidated by and friendly with the now-disgraced studio head.\n\nBut some of the most fascinating revelations about Weinstein come from Farrow's own interactions with him. Midway through the book, Farrow describes repeatedly calling Weinstein for comment for his story, saying his manner would turn on a dime from \"funny\" to \"combative.\"\n\nDuring one heated phone call, Weinstein allegedly brought up Farrow's sister, Dylan Farrow, who alleges she was molested by adoptive father Woody Allen in 1992 when she was 7. Investigators found \"no credible evidence\" of sexual assault in 1993 and dropped the case, although Dylan revived the allegations early last year in an emotional interview with CBS This Morning.\n\n\"Weinstein laughed,\" Farrow writes of their conversation. \" 'You couldn't save someone you love, and now you think you can save everyone.' He really said this.\"\n\n\"Harvey Weinstein was famous for a bullying, needling and sometimes flattering style that was designed to keep people off balance, and those tactics became apparent very rapidly when you talked to him,\" Farrow tells USA TODAY.\n\nIn response, Weinstein issued a statement to USA TODAY via his spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, suggesting Farrow's reporting was influenced by Weinstein's movie-making relationship with Allen.\n\n\"What Ronan Farrow insinuates as factual accounts and conversations are actually an amalgamation of unrelated pieces of information that he formed together to tell what is little more than a dramatic fictional tale,\" Weinstein's statement said. \"His information is flawed, his 'facts' are inaccurate and his intention was to sell a novel, not break any honest news.\n\n\"Weinstein worked with Woody Allen and made movies together, and that is all there was. Farrow may not have liked that Allen and Weinstein made films with one another and that, Weinstein believes, remains a source of Farrow's troubled reporting.\"\n\nFarrow acknowledges that many of his critics have tried to discredit his reporting of the Weinstein accusations, saying he has a \"conflict of interest\" because of Dylan's own public battle.\n\nBut ultimately, \"my sister's experience helped me understand how important this issue (of sexual assault) was and the stakes of it, and helped me elevate my level of sensitivity as I had some of those conversations with the sources whose stories are in 'Catch and Kill.' \"\n\nContributing: Maria Puente\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/15/catch-and-kill-ronan-farrow-anthony-bourdain-megyn-kelly-more/3972503002/", "description": "In his headline-making new book \"Catch and Kill,\" Ronan Farrow shares insight about Anthony Bourdain, Harvey Weinstein, Megyn Kelly and Tom Brokaw.", "authors": ["Patrick Ryan", "John Sandford", "Rachel Maddow", "Delia Owens", "Stephen King", "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "Published P.M.
