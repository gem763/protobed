It\u2019s more fun than it sounds. I particularly enjoy it when my team members unearth the approaching month\u2019s anniversaries, which are mostly met with gasps from those who \u201ccan\u2019t quite believe\u201d a certain film or album is turning 40.\n\nNext week sees the anniversaries of two wildly different, but no less influential, television shows, that are beloved by two different people on our desk: sitcom Friends and the cult drama Lost, which premiered on the same day in the US \u2013 22 September \u2013 10 years apart (in 1994 and 2004, respectively).\n\nHow does one go about commemorating such shows? In an age of digital journalism, the first answer is usually the right one: we rank the episodes. While lists may get a bad rap from some people who write them off as nothing but lazy, let me tell you this \u2013 even contemplating putting the episodes into some form of order has left me sleepless.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s here I should confess that I\u2019m a Lost obsessive. I\u2019m a firm believer that it changed the shape of television in ways I won\u2019t bother to go into now. I even co-host a podcast with a friend who is watching for the first time \u2013 and yes, we\u2019re called The LOST Boys. My point being, in a non-ironic way, this could be the most important feature I\u2019ve ever been commissioned to write; I feel it\u2019s my duty to the show\u2019s fanbase \u2013 still one of the most dedicated after all these years \u2013 to make it as comprehensive as I possibly can.\n\nHaving seen the whole thing in its entirety around seven times, I fortunately didn\u2019t need to re-watch every single episode to confirm the ones I love and the ones I don\u2019t. This luxury wasn\u2019t afford to my colleague who underwent a gigantic re-watch of all 10 seasons of Friends (that\u2019s 236 episodes) to compile her list. In comparison, Lost ran for 121 episodes over six seasons \u2013 but, in my defence, every episode was double that of a Friends episode. And while I\u2019m not purporting to be doing important or essential work here, I believe that even agreeing to attempt this gargantuan task is the true mark of the show\u2019s legacy.\n\nNext year will mark 10 years since the series aired its divisive finale. In preparation, I\u2019m interviewing numerous cast members about their time on the show \u2013 and I think the only people more in awe of this than myself are my family and schoolfriends who had to put up with my relentless Lost chatter when I was a teenager. And now it turns out, thanks to my job, it wasn\u2019t all for nothing.\n\nYours,\n\nJacob Stolworthy\n\nCulture reporter", "description": "Each month, the culture team gather and throw around all the feature ideas we\u2019ve had rattling around our heads.
