Even if it's your first win, you don't feel like you earned it. \u2014 CLG Marksman (@Marksman) August 15, 2019 Report\n\nSkip Twitter post by @HardXBL I miss the old Fortnite, straight out of Greasy Grove Fortnite, fun and simple Fortnite, I hate the new Fortnite, straight out the B.R.U.T.E Fortnite, the bad noobs Fortnite, I miss the good Fortnite, the double pump Fortnite, I gotta say at this time I'm kind of sick of Fortnite \u2014 Hard \ud83d\ude08 (@HardXBL) August 15, 2019 Report\n\nAnd while Epic Games didn't directly link the downgrade to the backlash - they did acknowledge that people weren't happy.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIf you're familiar with the gaming community, you won't be surprised to learn this latest announcement has made some people very happy and others very upset.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @Bruisr_ Joking aside, this is the kind of update that *might* get me to want to play again. Shadowkeep is going to play a huge role in my limited game time, BUT, knowing I won't get a lobby full of pro's each time will make me interested in playing again. \u2014 Bruisr (@Bruisr_) September 23, 2019 Report\n\nThe changes are due to be rolled out later this week.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "For the first time, computer-controlled characters are going to be added to the battle royale game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14FAC/production/_108923958_gettyimages-1053756114.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
