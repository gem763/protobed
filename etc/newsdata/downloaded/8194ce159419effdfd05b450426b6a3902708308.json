He proceeded to go 161-163 in his two seasons on the job.\n\nThe first-time manager immediately faced scrutiny for his strategical decisions during games. While a tumultuous start to his tenure had some calling for his job, he managed to survive the 2018 campaign as the team remained in contention late into the summer.\n\nHowever, an 8-20 September knocked the Phillies out of the playoff race.\n\nAn 80-82 record in Kapler's first year represented Philadelphia's best performance since an 81-win season in 2012. Expectations for his second season skyrocketed, though, following a busy winter.\n\nDuring the offseason, Philadelphia added 2015 National League MVP Bryce Harper, 2013 NL MVP Andrew McCutchen, 2018 All-Star catcher J.T. Realmuto, two-time All-Star shortstop Jean Segura and 2011 All-Star pitcher David Robertson. Not only that, but the team also acquired three-time All-Star right fielder Jay Bruce in June.\n\nDespite all of those high-profile transactions, the Phillies found themselves underperforming. Even through a seven-game losing streak in June, though, Kapler stressed teamwork:\n\nPhiladelphia's postseason hopes remained alive until late in the season, but it was eliminated from contention on Sept. 24. At that point, Kapler made his case to return for a third season, per Salisbury:\n\n\"We have games left to play. Like I said, there\u2019s going to be plenty of opportunity to reflect. I love this organization. I love this team specifically. I love working for this front office. I love working for this ownership group. And look, I\u2019m going to manage this club as long as I can. Because I think I give us a great chance to win and I think because I care deeply about the success of this franchise.\"\n\nUltimately, though, the higher-ups decided it was time for a change.", "description": "The  Philadelphia Phillies \u00a0fired skipper  Gabe Kapler  on Thursday after a disappointing second season with the club.
