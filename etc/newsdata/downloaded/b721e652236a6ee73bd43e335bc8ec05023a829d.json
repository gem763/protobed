It\u2019s hard to explain \u2013 and probably sounds a bit naff \u2013 but it just did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was on my own but I said to myself \u2018if this is my copy it will have some writing on the inside\u2019.\n\n\u2018I was thinking this as I turned the page to see my old handwriting, Hannah\u2019s name and a bunch of symbols which I recognised as being from my hieroglyphic obsession.\n\nZoe and her sister Hannah (Picture: Zoe Andrews/SWNS)\n\n\u2018I stood there dumbfounded. I text my mother immediately. I thought \u2018well, I have to buy it \u2013 it\u2019s meant to be.\u2019\n\nZoe couldn\u2019t help to think about the journey the book had been on since the last time she saw it and says she is very glad to have it back on her bookshelf.\n\nShe added: \u2018It\u2019s a very bizarre feeling to find something you loved as a child and to think of its journey.\n\n\u2018How many other children owned and read that book? Did they ever wonder who Hannah was?\n\nZoe said she just felt like the book was her copy the minute she saw it (Picture: Zoe Andrews / SWNS)\n\n\u2018Well, she\u2019s my little sister. I say little, she\u2019s 33 and I\u2019m 35 now.\n\n\u2018We read these books in the late 1980s and early 1990s but they brought great joy.\n\n\u2018I always loved the story and when I reflect on it now it really is a fantastic story about strength and well-being.\u2019\n\nThe museum snapped a picture of Zoe and posted it on social media and people loved it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZoe said: \u2018The reaction through the museum\u2019s Twitter page has been incredible.\n\n\u2018It has been so lovely to see the reaction of people and so many other stories where old books, possessions have turned up years later. I love the serendipity of it.\n\n\u2018After three weeks of feeling very under the weather, it was a perfect pick me up. And now it\u2019s back on my bookshelf, where it will stay.\u2019\n\nMORE: You could be paid \u00a34k a year to trial slippers for a footwear company\n\nMORE: Woman says a vegan diet has cured her severe psoriasis\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Zoe Andrews spotted a copy of The Secret Garden in the Museum of Rural Life bookshop and realised it was her copy from 25 years ago", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91172057_1571746948.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
