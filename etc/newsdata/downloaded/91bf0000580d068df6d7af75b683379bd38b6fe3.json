I\u2019m now 27 and people are shocked when I say have it.\n\nI get reactions like \u2018isn\u2019t that what old people have?\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019re far too young to have that\u2019.\n\nI find it really frustrating \u2013 there are 18 million people in the UK who have arthritis or a related condition and it shows there is still a huge lack of awareness of the condition in young people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalf of us experience pain every day, yet if you met me you probably wouldn\u2019t know it because I hide my pain out of fear of being judged or feeling like a burden.\n\nI have worried that I\u2019m always going to be a liability to others (Picture: Kaytie Hayward)\n\nThere have been times when I couldn\u2019t pick up a glass of water or open the door because I was in so much pain.\n\nThe simplest things become the hardest challenges \u2013 emptying the dish washer, making a cup of tea, doing my jeans up. Recently my ankles and hands have been bad and I\u2019ve had to get a taxi to work as I can\u2019t walk properly.\n\nIf I have something on I just pray I\u2019m going to have a good day but I\u2019m constantly on edge wondering what the day will bring. Relying on other people to do things for you is pretty tough and I feel like I\u2019m annoying everyone.\n\nMy friends and family are understanding and always there to help but it can be hard for people to understand. I have worried that I\u2019m always going to be a liability to others and I\u2019ve struggled to open up to anyone in fear of how they\u2019d react.\n\nI was on steroids for a period of time, which caused my face to swell up. On one of the days I was well enough to pop out for a drink, a boy from school commented on how different I looked. I pretty much cried for days afterwards I was so embarrassed, but they weren\u2019t aware of my medication and the impact it had.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the charity Versus Arthritis launched their awareness campaign last year, I thought \u2018finally, people are going to get what I\u2019m going through\u2019.\n\nSeeing other young people share their stories for something that depicted my reality so well has helped me massively, so I want to be as open as I can.\n\nI no longer have to dismiss or hide my pain, or let it define me (Picture: Kaytie Hayward)\n\nTaking something negative and using it in a positive way has only empowered me. I\u2019ve created a healthy mind-set for myself and one of my goals is to help other young people who have been diagnosed.\n\nI\u2019ve missed out on a lot of things through the years, including my dream to pursue a career in dance.\n\nA flare up might mean not being able to go into work but thankfully I\u2019ve found medication that works for me and I hope by being honest with my employers about my arthritis from the outset, things will be easier.\n\nKnowing that there is no cure for arthritis at the moment and that I\u2019m likely to have it forever is really difficult. I worry about how I\u2019ll look after children if I have them. I love to host and cook for people but when I can\u2019t even make a cup of tea, I feel very frustrated.\n\nI still get comments from people who don\u2019t believe I\u2019m old enough to have arthritis but I don\u2019t get upset anymore. Too many people with arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions hold back from discussing their experience in case they are dismissed because it\u2019s \u2018only arthritis\u2019 \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t have to be like this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe need to speak up about the reality of living with the long-term pain. There\u2019s a growing community of people standing together with the millions of people living with persistent pain \u2013 I\u2019m one of them.\n\nWe need to reach out, support each other and talk, because speaking out about my experiences has released a huge weight off my shoulders.\n\nI\u2019ve gone from being a really private person about my condition to feeling like I no longer have to dismiss or hide my pain, or let it define me. It\u2019s become a part of who I am, and I feel freer.\n\nVersus Arthritis\u2019 #PainNoFilter campaign is shining a light on the reality of living with arthritis.
