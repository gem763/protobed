They expected a suspension similar to the one that, the day before, put pro player Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai on the sidelines for a year. That punishment never came, but the players won\u2019t be competing.\n\nThe three players \u2014 Casey Chambers, Corwin Dark and a third player who simply goes by his online handle, TJammer \u2014 held up the sign on Thursday, following Hearthstone developer Blizzard suspending Blitzchung for making a statement in support of protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nAfter the incident, Blizzard and tournament organising partner Tespa booked American University into their next scheduled match, sans any sort of punitive measures. Today, the three players said they\u2019re going to forfeit the match and cease participating in tournaments.\n\n\u201cWe feel it\u2019s hypocritical for Blizzard to punish Blitzchung but not us,\u201d the players told USgamer. \u201cThe response from Blizzard shows that as soon as the messaging is out of the view of China, they don\u2019t care about \u2018political\u2019 messaging.\u201d\n\nDuring the now-infamous Hearthstone Asia-Pacific Grandmasters stream that kicked off this week\u2019s Blizzard controversy, Blitzchung wore a mask and said \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age!\u201d\n\nIn response, Blizzard suspended him for a year and put a hold on his prize money. The American University players purposefully echoed his message in a show of solidarity, but so far, Blizzard seems to be treating it like business as usual.\n\nThese players join a host of pros, commentators, and fans in protesting Blizzard\u2019s decision making. Blizzard, meanwhile, has now backed itself into an impossible corner.\n\nIf it suspended the American University players, fans would\u2019ve inevitably been even more furious than they already are. But in its silence, Blizzard has created an obvious double standard \u2014 one that is simply too egregious for some players to abide by.", "description": "Earlier this week, three collegiate Hearthstone players on the American University team held up a sign that read \u201cFree Hong Kong, Boycott Blizz\u201d during a stream broadcasted on Blizzard\u2019s official Hearthstone Twitch channel.
