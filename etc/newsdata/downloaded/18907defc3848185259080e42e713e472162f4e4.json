Can I refuse to investigate? In terms of the Executive Members Ethics Act, I must investigate any alleged breaches of the Executive Code of Ethics,\" Mkhwebane insisted.\n\nFactions\n\nShe said the office she occupied was apolitical, but that sometimes it enters the realm of politics.\n\n\"As a result, we do not even know who belongs to which faction of the ANC. We hear from the media that this one is with that faction and so forth\u2026 [but] as you will see, I have made adverse findings against even those the media tell us belong to the faction we are accused today of protecting.\"\n\nMkhwebane also used the opportunity to send condolences to the family of former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, who died aged 95 on Friday morning.\n\n\"His passing is a huge loss to the continent,\" she said.", "description": "Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says there is no truth in the belief that she is targeting President Cyril Ramaphosa and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9263/388235ad510c4aaaa6a8e00bad80a3cb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
