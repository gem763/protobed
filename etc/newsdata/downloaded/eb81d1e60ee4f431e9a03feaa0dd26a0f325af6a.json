And I couldn\u2019t have been happier.\n\nThis was all about climate change, an echo of the worldwide demonstrations led primarily by young people who are scared and wanted to cripple the District for a day to make their point.\n\nShut Down DC was created to coincide with the 2019 U.N. Climate Action Summit and to follow the demonstrations in New York led by teen Swede Greta Thunberg, who dropped the mic on Congress last week when she testified by dropping the science of climate change on them.\n\nI\u2019ve covered these kinds of protests for nearly three decades, and I\u2019m not always a fan.\n\nDuring the World Bank protests a decade ago, watching police officers on double overtime being jeered by college kids dancing with puppets left me more skeptical of the demonstrators than of capitalism.\n\n32 arrested as \u2018climate rebels\u2019 shut down intersections across the District\n\nToo often, these demonstrations are just an excuse to generate chaos, to ignore the complexity of important issues, to cartoon what should be nuanced, to punish and inconvenience those who are not guilty of the crimes they are chanting about.\n\nThe Monday protest had the usual theater. There were at least 32 arrests, including people chained to a pink-and-yellow sailboat at the intersection of greed and influence \u2014 I mean 16th and K streets NW. There were puppets and dancing and chanting.\n\nBut on Capitol Hill, I quietly cheered on the protesters creating a gridlock of steel, rubber and glass that stretched the entire length of a city block.\n\nBecause this time, the bad guys aren\u2019t all sitting in their high-rise offices, looking out the windows and laughing at protesters as they burn $100 bills for fun.\n\nSome of the huge offenders wrecking our environment are corporations, yes. And an administration that rejects science and enables polluters isn\u2019t helping either. But the guy sitting there, alone in traffic, drumming his steering wheel and sipping his to-go cup of 7-Eleven hazelnut with extra sugar is No. 1 on the list of villains.\n\nFor the first time in 40 years, it\u2019s not factories that are doing the most damage.\n\nU.S. greenhouse emissions spiked in 2018\n\nTransportation \u2014 our cars, buses, trucks and planes \u2014 is the No. 1 contributor to the toxic cloud of greenhouse gases that America emits, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThat\u2019s happening because of the relaxation or elimination of emissions standards. And even when states try to hold the line, the Trump administration still tries to give corporate America the upper hand \u2014 take a look at the regulatory war between California and the administration. No, I don\u2019t want to go back to a skyline the color of Trump\u2019s hair, which was the Los Angeles skyline of my youth.\n\nBut in this case, environmental stewardship is an issue that can be tackled by every single person on the planet.\n\nTake a look at the morning and evening commutes. Rivers and rivers of traffic are filled with cars each driven by one person. Some of that is personal preference and entitlement. But for a lot of folks, our ailing public transportation systems are too expensive, cumbersome and inefficient to be a viable option.\n\nAn efficient and smart public transportation system is one of the keys to a healthy society. And that comes only if people storm meetings, vote and demand that our leaders create the kind of sustainable and user-friendly systems already in use around the world.\n\nThat\u2019s the beginning. But each ride we take that we don\u2019t need to is a micro-contributor to the change in our climate, to the tropical storms battering our coasts, the floods in Iowa, the drought that\u2019s parching global farmlands and contributing to scarcity. All of it is sparking wars and prompting displacement and migrations.\n\nIt\u2019s one sky, one planet that we\u2019re all on; borders and walls and oceans don\u2019t change that.\n\nSo go ahead, marchers. Block the streets, make us late, make us think, make us act.\n\nTwitter: @petulad\n\nRead more Petula Dvorak:\n\nSave Sursum Corda\u2019s eight heritage trees?
