Even before his part in the opening goal, the runs of Maxime Colin along the right posing a real problem for Ryan Shotton. But for an astonishing point-blank save by Darren Randolph, the former Birmingham goalkeeper, Villalba would have scored after three minutes after a deflected Colin cross ran for him.\n\nOnly Randolph came between Birmingham and the goal twice more, preventing a Dael Fry own goal and clawing another Colin cross from under his bar. Lee Camp was drawn into the action at the other end, keeping out a fiercely struck free kick by Marcus Tavernier at his near post.\n\nStory continues\n\nVillalba\u2019s first Birmingham goal, emphatically finished by the 21-year-old Spaniard on a return pass from Colin, swelled the home side\u2019s confidence and the Middlesbrough defence was close to being breached again in a breathless finale to the half. Randolph just managed to keep a looping Harlee Dean header from crossing the line before another header, this time from Kristian Pedersen, hit the underside of the bar.\n\nMiddlesbrough, like their opponents, were three without a win coming into this game. There were few signs the run would not extend to four as Birmingham continued to hold the upper hand in the second half.\n\nJude Bellingham, the 16-year-old who has caught the eye of some major clubs at home and abroad, impressed in the Birmingham midfield. Yet his side needed another goal as two changes by Woodgate sparked the first spell of pressure from the visitors, culminating in Ayala forcing the ball in after Britt Assombalonga had stolen possession from Dean.\n\nBut at the other end, Ivan Sunjic kept his calm to find Dan Crowley in space on the right and his cross was headed in by Bailey, an 83rd-minute replacement, to the delight of the St Andrew\u2019s crowd.\n\nMatch details\n\nBirmingham City (4-4-2): Camp; Colin, Roberts, Dean, Pedersen; Crowley, Bellingham (G Gardner 74), Sunjic, Villalba (Maghoma 76); Jutkiewicz (Bailey 83), Giminez.
