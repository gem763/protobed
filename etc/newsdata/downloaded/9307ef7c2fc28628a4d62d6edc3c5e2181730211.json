Can Alexa understand your child? Can she be fun for the kids while honoring parents' rules? Amazon's Josh Sherman walks through these challenges and more.\n\nThose of you who want an Amazon Echo Dot will find it hard to ignore new bundle deals currently exclusive to Amazon. Tile is essentially offering combos of its newest trackers and giving a free Echo Dot to anyone who buys them.\n\nThe Echo Dot is Amazon's smallest Alexa-powered speaker. It costs $50 and is consistently the best-selling Echo device. Even if you already own one, you can pick up another and sync them together to get a multi-room audio experience. But if you'd like to save money and get one for free, consider picking up one of the following bundles:\n\nTo be clear, the Tile Sticker four-pack is normally $59.99, and the Tile Mate and Tile Slim four-pack is normally $74.99, so while you're not saving on the Tiles themselves, you are getting a free Amazon Echo Dot -- a $50 value.\n\nTechnically, there are other Tile bundles available on Amazon that come with a free Echo Dot. The Essentials Combo, for instance, includes one Mate, one Slim, two Stickers, and an Echo Dot for $69.99. You can also get a Mate four-pack with an Echo Dot for $69.99. Have a look around the site to see which bundle deal piques your interest the most.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot and Essentials Combo (one Mate, one Slim, two Sticker) for $69.99\n\n\n\nThe Tile Slim is the size of two credit cards and can fit in narrow spaces such as your wallet, while the Tile Mate offers a 200-ft range and attaches to keys. The Tile Sticker, on the other hand, has an adhesive back and offers a 150-ft range. All three can pair with the Tile app and allow you to leverage the entire Tile community to find your lost or misplaced items.\n\nThe best part is, with any of these bundles, you can ask Alexa to find your everyday necessities like keys and wallets and TV remotes and dog leashes. It's a heck of deal -- and it's available from now until Christmas Day, only on Amazon.\n\nFor more great deals on devices, gadgetry, and tech for your enterprise, business, or home office, see ZDNet's Business Bargain Hunter blog.
