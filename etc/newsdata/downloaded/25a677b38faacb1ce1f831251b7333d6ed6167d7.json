Photo: Kimberley French/Twentieth Century Fox\n\nJojo Rabbit should not work.\n\nThat\u2019s not a review because it\u2019s not an opinion, it\u2019s just a statement of fact. Jojo Rabbit, which just premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, is not just a film about a young member of the Hitler Youth who dreams of becoming the F\u00fchrer\u2019s personal bodyguard; it is a comedy about a young member of the Hitler Youth who dreams of becoming the F\u00fchrer\u2019s personal bodyguard. (Between this and Anthony Hopkins\u2019s critically acclaimed turn as Pope Benedict XVI in The Two Popes, it\u2019s a big festival for the Hitler Youth.) And it is not just a comedy in the Golden Globes sense. Jojo Rabbit happens to be an incredibly silly comedy \u2014 sample joke: \u201cYou know what I am.\u201d \u201cA Jew.\u201d \u201cGesundheit.\u201d \u2014 that features director Taika Waititi playing Hitler as a buffoonish imaginary friend, and opens with a montage where newsreel footage of real Nazi rallies plays over the Beatles\u2019 \u201cKomm, gib mir deine Hand.\u201d\n\nActually, that\u2019s not quite right. The movie really opens with the triumphant 20th Century Fox fanfare turning into a Third Reich theme song. Reports have suggested that executives at Disney, which finds itself releasing Jojo Rabbit after acquiring the film as part of Fox Searchlight\u2019s slate, have been somewhat flabbergasted by their new big fall movie. I believe it.\n\nSo yes, everyone in Toronto can agree that, on paper, Jojo Rabbit shouldn\u2019t work. What they have trouble agreeing on is everything else. Waititi is aiming for the same blend of tone and subject matter that turned Roberto Benigni into a laughingstock (an Oscar-winning laughingstock, but still), that even Jerry Lewis himself couldn\u2019t bring himself to release, and not everyone here is convinced he\u2019s pulled it off. Where you land will probably depend on how much you consider Waititi\u2019s sense of humor, honed on HBO\u2019s Flight of the Conchords and introduced to the masses on Thor: Ragnarok, an end in itself. The audience at my press-and-industry screening Monday morning seemed to eat it up, and at the premiere it received a lengthy standing ovation \u2014 though I suspect in both cases those who were less enthralled may have been keeping schtum, because the reviews have told a different story. Jojo Rabbit currently has a 49 on Metacritic and a 55 on Rotten Tomatoes, and in this case, that\u2019s not a wishy-washy 50. Slashfilm\u2019s Chris Evangelista calls it \u201cone of the year\u2019s best films.\u2019 Keith Uhlich at Slant gives it zero stars. Even a mixed review like Owen Gleiberman\u2019s in Variety ultimately dubs it a \u201cdefanged black comedy [that wants] to leave us feeling good about the fact that we\u2019re above a feel-good movie.\u201d Unlike many of the dutiful, middlebrow entries at TIFF, this is not a film that tends to inspire bland reactions.\n\nWhich side will you fall on with Jojo Rabbit? Here is a handy guide:\n\n\u2014 Does the phrase \u201cMoonrise Kingdom, but in the Third Reich\u201d sound to you like a compliment or an insult?\n\n\u2014 Do you enjoy puns?\n\n\u2014 Do you particularly enjoy stupid puns?\n\n\u2014 Does the idea of Adolf Hitler as a sassy, advice-giving pal make you chuckle or wince?\n\n\u2014 Do you have a soft spot for \u201cHelden,\u201d David Bowie\u2019s German-language version of \u201cHeroes,\u201d which you consider far superior to his French-language version \u201cH\u00e9ros\u201d?\n\n\u2014 Would you laugh if Wehrmacht soldiers were presented as figures of campy fun?\n\n\u2014 Do you agree that German accents are funnier when they are done poorly?\n\n\u2014 Are you not morally opposed to any story about the Holocaust that has a happy ending?\n\nIf you answered \u201cyes\u201d to most of these questions, then you are like me: a spiritually compromised philistine who loved Jojo Rabbit. If you answered no, well, you are going to have a lot to argue about this fall. In Toronto, at least, the pros seem to be outnumbering the antis. This is not a movie for everyone, but everyone it is for seems to be right here.", "description": "Unlike many of the dutiful, middlebrow entries at TIFF, \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d is not a film that tends to inspire bland reactions.", "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/oscar-curtain/jojo-rabbit-curtain-raiser.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
