(AP) - The number of visitors to Glacier National Park in Montana has risen after a busy August that followed seven months of decreased visitation.\n\nThe Flathead Beacon reports the park had 771,874 visitors in August, an increase of more than 15% from the same month last year when 667,688 people visited.\n\nOfficials say a likely reason for the August increase is the absence of a major wildfire for the first time in three years.\n\nRecords released this week indicate more than 2.45 million people have visited the park in 2019.\n\nThe figure is a nearly 2% increase over the number of visitors during the same period in 2018.\n\nThe park\u2019s year-to-date visitation figures were down more than 3% a month ago, with 1.6 million people visiting between January and July.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Flathead Beacon, http://www.flatheadbeacon.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The number of visitors to Glacier National Park in Montana has risen after a busy August that followed seven months of decreased visitation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
