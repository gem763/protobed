We can see it with the Shia militias in Iraq. They\u2019re scrambling for resources. We think the Iranian government will shrink, that their GDP will shrink by as much as 12 or 14 percent this year,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d speaking to the economic impact. \u201cThis will reduce their capacity to purchase the things they need, the equipment they need, the materials they need, to inflict terror around the world.\u201d\n\nThe impact has been so severe that of the 18 existing retirement funds in Iran, 17 are in the red, according to these documents. That includes the pension funds for all of Iran\u2019s armed forces.\n\nAs much as 80 percent of Iran\u2019s retirement funds rely on government subsidies, which the documents refer to as unsustainable for not just pensions but for food products, drugs and fuel.\n\nThere are also signs of a growing crisis in Iran\u2019s real estate market. The documents refer to the interconnected challenges as a \u201chouse of cards.\u201d\n\nTrump \u2013 who campaigned during the 2016 election calling the Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran \u201cthe worst deal ever\u201d \u2013 announced plans for the U.S. to withdraw from the deal in 2018.\n\nIRAN'S LATEST NUCLEAR DEAL BREACH\n\nHowever, American allies France, Britain and Germany are still in the Iran nuclear deal, trying to salvage it and allow Iran to sell its oil. Iranian officials have met with France and Japan, while China continues buying Iranian oil despite American sanctions.\n\n\u201cI noted the repeated statements by @SecPompeo that Iran must change its policies in order for Iranians to eat is pure #EconomicTerrorism,\u201d Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, recently tweeted. \u201cTying bread & medicine to politics is to kill & starve people into submission. Iranians will never capitulate.\u201d\n\nThe details from the pressure campaign come amid reports that Trump is now considering throwing support behind a plan crafted by French President Emmanuel Macron that would extend a $15 billion line of credit to the regime in Tehran if leaders agree to come back into compliance with terms of the 2015 nuclear agreement.\n\nIran has been taking steps away from those terms, most recently announcing it would take new measures to speed up uranium enrichment as part of its nuclear program.\n\nA State Department spokesperson called that announcement \u201canother transparent attempt to generate negotiating leverage and extort the international community,\u201d and added: \u201cWe have made clear that the regime\u2019s political and economic isolation will only deepen if it takes further steps that increase concerns about its nuclear program.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, questions remain over whether Trump could meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York later this month.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump has expressed a willingness to meet Rouhani, but the Iranian president has ruled it out, saying no meeting can take place until the United States drops sanctions.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Crippling sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran since President Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal last year have left pension funds throughout the country on the brink of collapse, according to documents reviewed by National Security Council officials and obtained by Fox News.", "authors": ["Nick Kalman"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/11/694940094001_6085459424001_6085461306001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
