She also regularly needs to give her children cash for school meals, stationery and trips.\n\nRosalind, 51, says: 'Life on a remote island is never easy but Barclays is taking away a system that works. The bank is making life so much harder for its customers.'\n\n'A real impact on villagers'\n\nBlogger Emma Drew is furious at the bank's decision. She has seen two branches she previously relied on close in the past few years, one of which was the only bank in her village.\n\nThe 31-year-old says she and the community now depend on the post office for cash withdrawals, especially as many of the ATMs in Littleport, Cambridgeshire, are often targeted by fraudsters.\n\nEmma and husband Tony, 32, have their sole accounts, joint account and business account with the bank. Emma typically visits the post office once a week to withdraw around \u00a350 a time.\n\nShe says: 'We were angry when we lost the bank \u2014 the only one in the village. And now Barclays is stopping us getting our money from the post office. All the other banks can do it so we don't understand why Barclays is refusing.\n\n'Lots of people in the village are concerned about the impact it will have on their elderly relatives who rely on the post office and are less able to travel to another branch.'\n\n'I am sick of the poor service'\n\nPensioner Shirley Livingstone has been forced to change her branch four times because they keep closing.\n\nWhen the branch in Otley, West Yorkshire, shut last year she wrote and complained.\n\nLifeline: Shirley Livingstone's post office in Pool-in-Wharfedale which she relies on regularly to withdraw cash because she does not like keeping money at home\n\nThe former charity fundraiser says she does not like using ATMs because she does not trust the security so uses her post office in Pool-in-Wharfedale regularly to withdraw cash because she does not like keeping money at home.\n\nShirley, who is in her 80s, has been a customer of Barclays for 56 years and says she was furious when she heard of the plan.\n\nShe says: 'I am sick of Barclays and this just adds to my dissatisfaction over the years.\n\nI do not think it is giving customers any service at all. I want it to reverse this decision and if it does not I am switching banks.'\n\n'The elderly are really angry'\n\nRecently widowed Margaret Booth never thought Barclays would go this far. She says: 'First the bank branches went and then the ATMs and now we are being told we cannot get our money from the post office. There are lots of elderly people in the village who are really angry about this.'\n\nMargaret, 70, visits the post office in Penkridge, Staffordshire, a number of times a week to get cash for herself and her parents, who are in their 90s.\n\nRecently widowed Margaret Booth visits the post office in Penkridge, Staffordshire, a number of times a week to get cash for herself and her parents, who are in their 90s\n\nThe only cash machine that residents trust is at Sainsbury's but she says it runs out of money at least twice a week. The nearest towns are more than ten miles away but parking is often an issue.\n\nShe adds: 'As a widow I do not have a lot of money and I like to use cash so I can keep an eye on my spending \u2014 Barclays has said it will not close any more branches in the next two years but that's just too late for us.\n\n'They have already shut our local one two years ago. I thought it might change its mind but if not I will be changing my bank.'\n\n'It has been such a lifeline for us'\n\nVillagers in Steeple Morden, Cambridgeshire, have already started closing their Barclays accounts, according to resident Alan Hudson.\n\nHe says: 'People in the village are very angry about Barclays' decision. The post office is a lifeline for many people, not just pensioners but also small businesses in the surrounding areas.'\n\nAlan and his wife, Jennifer, both 74, play bowls five or six times a week and pay \u00a33 a game in cash.\n\nThey use the post office to take out around \u00a360 at the start of the week. The nearest cash machine is around six miles away but this is often out of order.\n\nAn ATM at Tesco is a further three miles away.\n\nAlan, who used to work in sales, says: 'At the end of the day it is our money Barclays is playing with \u2014 don't they think it's right for us to have a say in how we access it?'\n\nVote with your feet and switch Barclays customers who are unhappy with the plan to cut off their Post Office cash access can hit the bank in the pocket by taking their business elsewhere. Most banks, including Barclays, have signed up to the Current Account Switch Service (Cass). This means they agree to transfer your account and payments, including all your direct debits and your salary, to another bank within seven working days. First, pick the bank to which you want to move. Every week, Money Mail publishes a table of the best accounts, which is a good place to start. Savings Champion and MoneySavingExpert also list top deals on their websites. Ask your new bank or building society to switch your account using Cass. You can do this online, over the telephone or at a branch. You will need to sign a \u2018Current Account Switch Agreement\u2019 and \u2018Current Account Closure Instruction\u2019 form, which will both be given to you by the new provider. Remember to have the details of your old account to hand \u2014 sort code, account number and debit card, plus details of any overdraft. You may also need to provide ID and proof of address. Your account should be opened within seven working days. You can choose the switch date as long as it is at least seven working days from your application date and does not fall on a weekend or bank holiday. If there are any problems, speak to your new bank. You will be covered by the Cass guarantee which means any charges incurred as a result of errors will be refunded. You cannot use Cass to switch savings accounts or Isas. Joint current accounts can be switched with permission from both customers. A number of banks also offer switching bonuses if you use Cass. HSBC pays \u00a3175 \u2014 the most generous incentive on the market \u2014 if you switch to its Advance or Premier account. You\u2019ll get \u00a375 to move to a basic account. NatWest offers \u00a3150 if you move by December 6. Lloyds pays \u00a3125 to switch to Club Lloyds or Club Lloyds Platinum by November 5. moneymail@dailymail.co.uk\n\n'We need cash around here'\n\nJohn and Jean Stephens have been Barclays customers for the best part of 60 years.\n\nSince moving to Llangurig in Wales 13 years ago, three bank branches have closed. John, 83, says the Barclays branch was the last to go around a year ago.\n\nThe couple use the post office in the village shop at the heart of the community to withdraw cash once a week \u2014 around \u00a3150 a time. Their nearest Barclays is 20 miles away.\n\nJohn, a former service manager, says: 'Everybody needs cash around here \u2014 to pay the milkman and to buy logs for the fire.\n\n'My wife and I are still driving but we would be really stuck if we did not. Barclays does not seem to care about its customers. It has made this decision without considering us.'\n\n'This decision is such a hassle'\n\nPensioners Guy and Sarah Norrie say they will have no choice but to drive 40 minutes to the nearest Barclays branch.\n\nGuy, 79, says he withdraws \u00a3250 at a time from the post office in Stockbridge, Hampshire, which is much more convenient than driving to Winchester or Salisbury.\n\nMPs have urged Barclays boss Jes Staley, who was paid \u00a33.4 million last year, to perform a 'rapid U-turn'\n\nGuy, who has been a Barclays customer since he was 18, says: 'The bank's decision will be a huge inconvenience to those of us living in the country with no access to Barclays branches other than by driving to city centres and having to pay for parking.'\n\n'This is monstrous'\n\nSheila Tolhurst, an 80-year-old widow, visits the post office once a week in Banham, Norfolk, to withdraw cash for shopping and paying for help in the garden.\n\nSheila, who used to work in local government, says after 50 years of being a Barclays customer she will now switch banks.\n\nShe says: 'Barclays offers hardly any interest on instant saver accounts, it's shut local branches and has now announced this monstrous idea of stopping cash withdrawals at post offices which affects mainly the elderly, the disabled and people in rural areas.'\n\nNatalie Ceeney, independent chairman of the Access To Cash Review, has backed our campaign.\n\nShe says: 'Money Mail readers affected by Barclays' decision come from groups we warned would be impacted. I hope Barclays comes to its senses once it reads their stories and reverses its decision.'\n\nGareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, says: 'Banks often cite nearby post offices as an alternative when they close branches, so Barclays' shocking decision to end cash withdrawals from the post office network will prove a real blow to countless customers. Many people have told us that they feel abandoned by the bank.\n\n'The Government must step in and introduce legislation that guarantees consumers can continue to access and pay with cash for as long as it is needed.'\n\nBetrayal: Barclays customers have been repeatedly reassured they can visit one of 11,500 post offices to deposit and withdraw cash, pay in cheques and check their balances\n\nA Post Office spokesman says: 'We would be delighted if Barclays reversed its decision so the bank's customers can withdraw cash after that point. Barclays customers who make deposits at our branches are unaffected.'\n\nBarclays insists no customers will be without access to cash. It says those that rely on the post office may be able to make cash withdrawals by cheque.\n\nIt is also introducing a cashback scheme with 200 businesses in locations where there is no branch or ATM within 1km.\n\nAdam Rowse, managing director of branch-based banking at Barclays, says: 'We are constantly exploring new ways to evolve the role of the branch.\n\nBy maintaining last-in-town or remote branches over the next two years, and working with the community, we hope to increase demand and keep these branches viable.\n\n'Our commitment means none of our customers will be without access to cash. We constantly review the services we offer through third parties and despite removing cash withdrawals, our financial contribution to the Post Office for the banking framework will increase in 2020.'\n\nBarclays Betrayal: Your letters Has the bank any idea what distress this causes elderly people in rural areas with no bus services, such as ours? We do not suppose [Barclays] cares very much. E. G. , Barnwell, Northamptonshire. I will have to travel 20 miles to get to a Barclays bank. I am 83 years of age. Once again, the elderly are having to pay the price for badly run companies. S. A. , email. I have been a Barclays customer for over 40 years and am absolutely disgusted at the latest announcement.

I intend to change banks after 60 years. J. G. , email. I feel completely let down by Barclays. I believe it has no thought whatsoever for what its customers want. L. B. , email. My mother is 82 and walks with a stick. The Post Office is the nearest place she can reach to withdraw cash, and speaking to someone there is a lifeline. J. P-M, email.

I am 80 and have been a customer since the late Fifties and this is a complete insult. S. C. , Harwich, Essex. My mother has been a lifelong Barclays customer of more than 70 years, her closest branch is now 18 miles away. Barclays should be ashamed. T. U. , email. Please ask Barclays to reverse its very odd decision to cancel this vital service. Further, I would be very interested to learn the age of the individual who was responsible for this decision. P. J. T, email. Learning that Barclays is stopping cash withdrawals at the Post Office is hugely disappointing. Post Offices are the only reliable access point for many as banks are closing and journeys to find a branch are becoming longer. S. C. , email.

We have been with the bank over 50 years and to treat customers like this is a disgrace. J. A. , email. I have banked with Barclays since I was 16 and its disgraceful decision should be reconsidered. Its statement that \u2018none of our customers will be without access to cash to cash\u2019 is a lie. K. S. , Camelford. I am 70 and have been with Barclays since age 17. Our nearest branch is a 32-mile round trip to Liskeard or a ferry ride to Plymouth. Please, Barclays, think of your loyal customers. S. D. , Millbrook, Cornwall. Our nearest Barclays is ten miles away. Our nearest ATM is nearly a mile away, if it does not get blown up like it did this year. We do have a Post Office, but now Barclays is to stop us withdrawing cash there. S. B. , Grassington, N. Yorks. I have been a Barclays customer for over 30 years but will dump it due to its pure arrogance. T. C. ,email. I was a Barclays employee many years ago when customers came first. I am disgusted by this action which will affect many older people. Perhaps those making the decision should realise they will grow older as the years go by. J. B. , email. I have been with this bank all my life and am tempted to leave it in disgust over our treatment. A. S. , email. I am a widow in my 80s and find it hard to get about. I have to travel to the nearest village with a Post Office to get cash. Please do not let Barclays do this to us seniors. C. B. , email. We have been Barclays customers for more than 30 years. In its arrogance, the bank thinks loyal customers won\u2019t move, but it is wrong. C. H. ,email.
