(Simon & Schuster) More\n\nTo prove it, Curry showed \"Good Morning America\" how to make two different recipes using only five ingredients for those lazy weeknights.\n\n5-ingredient rotisserie chicken fried rice\n\nPHOTO: Kevin Curry's 5-ingredient Rotisserie Chicken Fried Rice dish. (Kevin Marple) More\n\nIngredients for four hearty servings:\n\nSpray olive oil (or cooking spray)\n\n1lb skinless Rotisserie chicken meat, chopped\n\n3 cups cooked and cooled (Instant) brown rice\n\n2 eggs\n\n1 cup frozen peas and carrots\n\n3 tablespoons lite soy sauce (or more/less to taste)\n\nFresh green onion\n\nToasted sesame seeds\n\nInstructions:\n\nPlace the instant brown rice in the microwave and cook according to instructions given.\n\nRemove the skin from rotisserie chicken, pull the meat from the bone, then chop it into pieces, about 1/2-inch to 1-inch in size.\n\nSet a nonstick skillet on medium high heat. When it\u2019s hot, spray with a little olive oil, then toss in the chicken and cooked rice. Mix it around in the skillet for about two minutes (enough to get a very light sear on the chicken), then make a hole in the middle of the skillet.\n\nBeat two eggs together in a small bowl then pour them in the middle of the skillet.\n\nLet the eggs bubble for a brief second, then immediately begin chopping the eggs up with a spatula and fold them into the chicken and rice. There should be no large, visible chunks of egg.\n\nFold in frozen peas and carrots, then add the soy sauce. Continue stirring for about one minute.\n\nThe heat of the skillet and the food will quickly thaw the peas and carrots, so be careful not to overcook.\n\nRemove from the heat, and if desired, garnish with fresh chopped green onion and toasted sesame seeds.\n\nBonus tips:\n\nCaramelize garlic and chopped green onion in olive oil before adding the chicken and rice.\n\nAdd fresh ginger & red pepper for a spicy kick.\n\nDrizzle 2 teaspoons of sesame oil at the end to enhance flavors.\n\nReduce carbs by adding only half the brown rice and substitute the remaining with steamed cauliflower rice.\n\nFor leftovers, substitute chicken with leftover shrimp cocktail or leftover veggies such as mushrooms and zucchini, and swap leftover brown rice for leftover quinoa (or other grain).\n\n5-ingredient cheese steak and avocado quesadilla\n\nPHOTO: Kevin Curry's 5-ingredient Cheesesteak and Avocado Quesadilla dish.
