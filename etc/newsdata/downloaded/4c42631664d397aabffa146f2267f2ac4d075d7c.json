It details a systematic war on core principles of American democracy itself.\n\nThe complaint confirms what seemed fairly clear from the readout of Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released on Wednesday: that Trump was offering quid-pro-quo policy favors in exchange for Zelensky investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The complaint goes further than that, in revealing that the call was one of several actions taken by Trump and his allies to corral Ukraine into interfering in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\u201d the whistleblower writes, before describing a pattern of Trump-sponsored pressure on Ukraine dating back months.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the complaint says, the White House\u2019s lawyers knew what they were doing was wrong at the time \u2014 engaging in a significant cover-up effort to hide Trump\u2019s indecent proposal.\n\n\u201cIn the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple US officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records,\u201d the whistleblower writes. \u201cWhite House officials told me that they were \u2018directed\u2019 by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored.\u201d\n\nThe twisting of the tools of statecraft to advance the president\u2019s political interests violate private political ends, and the purging of government records to hide misconduct, the basic animating ideals of democratic government. These revelations illustrate the ways in which the Trump presidency threatens American democracy \u2014 and the need for an impeachment process to hold him accountable.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint shows how Trump threatens American democracy\n\nA common feature of modern democracies that have backslid into a form of autocracy \u2014 places like Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela \u2014 is that leaders cease drawing distinctions between their personal political interests and the national interest.\n\nThey begin using policy, ranging from relations with foreign states to tax policy, as a tool to enhance their own political position and weaken their opposition. This behavior often overlaps with corruption, exploiting political power for financial gain; it\u2019s all driven by a bone-deep belief that the leader is entitled to use whatever means necessary to hold on to their position and gain advantage from it.\n\nThis belief, the modern authoritarian\u2019s twist on Louis XIV\u2019s \u201cl\u2019etat, c\u2019est moi,\u201d is antithetical to democracy. Democratic governments depend on what Harvard political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt call \u201cforbearance,\u201d the idea that you need to tolerate the opposition rather than use every tool available to crush them completely. Absent this sense of forbearance, a willingness to restrain yourself from all-out institutional warfare, then even democratically elected leaders start undermining the central idea of democracy: that disagreement is legitimate, and the opposition has a right to take power if they can win a free and fair election.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s commitment to forbearance has been weakening for a while \u2014 see extreme partisan gerrymandering and the blockade of Merrick Garland\u2019s Supreme Court nomination.\n\nTrump, who has amply demonstrated his disinterest in democratic ideals, has taken this to new lows. The Ukraine scandal \u2014 actively trying to push a foreign power to undermine one of his chief political rivals through coercion \u2014 shows his would-be authoritarian attitude in action.\n\nIndeed, Trump doesn\u2019t even seem to think there was anything wrong with his conduct. The White House voluntarily chose to release a summary of the call between Trump and Zelensky on Wednesday, a baffling move given that it included several lines basically confirming that Trump offered Zelensky quid pro quo \u2014 policy favors in exchange for going after Biden.\n\nAfter its release, the president helped clarify some of the logic by tweeting that the summary vindicated him. \u201cWill the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call \u2014 got them by surprise,\u201d the president wrote, suggesting he literally did not understand why his words as relayed by the summary were so troubling and concerning.\n\nThe whistleblower shows us that this anti-democratic attitude has taken hold at the White House.\n\nThe White House lawyers who reviewed the July 25 call clearly understood that it showed presidential misbehavior, but their reaction wasn\u2019t to blow the whistle themselves \u2014 it was to cover it up.\n\nNot only cover it up, in fact, but deepen the level of anti-democratic abuse. In one of the most damning passages from the whistleblower complaint, its author details allegations that White House lawyers hid the records of the call on a system that\u2019s supposed to be for highly classified information \u2014 and that this isn\u2019t the first time they\u2019ve misused this procedure to hide politically damaging information:\n\nThe transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature. One White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective... According to White House officials I spoke with, this was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the president\u2019s own misbehavior that screams out as undemocratic. His staffers are taking a system for preserving national security secrets and using it to deliberately hide information from Congress and the public to protect their boss. The (unnamed) White House officials who did this not only accept the president\u2019s idea that the instruments of state are his to command, but are willing to act on it as well.\n\nAnd with a handful of exceptions, most of the institutional Republican Party appears to be backing up Trump and his staffers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who rivals Trump in his hostility to forbearance, seems entirely uninterested in taking the whistleblower allegations seriously. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) dismissed the whistleblower\u2019s memo as a \u201ca coordinated effort to take second-hand information to create a narrative damaging to the President,\u201d an absurd characterization that nonetheless reflects much of what you\u2019re hearing from elected Republicans and allied media. Partisanship overwhelms any commitment to democracy.\n\nPerhaps nothing demonstrates the authoritarianism at the heart of this episode more clearly than comments by Trump to staff shortly after the whistleblower report\u2019s release. In the remarks, reported by the New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman, Trump suggests the whistleblowers\u2019 sources are tantamount to foreign agents \u2014 and implies that he would like to execute them.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d the president said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nTrump seems to think that exposing his own troubling behavior to the public is the moral equivalent of providing classified information to a foreign power, that crossing Trump is committing treason. It\u2019s pure conflation of the state and the president, to say nothing of the longing for the ability to inflict violence.\n\nThe notion that someone with this sort of mindset could win the presidency preoccupied America\u2019s founders. It is the express reason why they included the impeachment power in the Constitution.\n\n\u201cHe might pervert his administration into a scheme of [embezzlement] or oppression,\u201d James Madison warned during the Constitutional Convention debate over the power. \u201cHe might betray his trust to foreign powers.\u201d\n\nListen to Today, Explained\n\nThe White House released a record of President Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky, then went on the defensive.\n\nLooking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle?
