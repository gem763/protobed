Does he take the kids out running and playing football?\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nImmediately fans took to Twitter about the veteran presenter's question.\n\nOne said: \"Is dad sporty? He's played football for every club in the football league.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Is Peter Crouch quite sporty? Oh no.\"\n\nA third commented: \"Did #Lorraine just ask if Peter Crouch is 'quite sporty'?\"\n\nHowever, Abbey's answer suggested that Lorraine's question was justified after all.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nShe said: \"You'd think so, wouldn't you, Lorraine? But no, he doesn't.\n\n\"It's funny because Pete's obviously a professional athlete and he's very, very determined when it comes to his job, and I'm not competitive at all, but when we go to watch Sophia, he says to her 'Sophia, it's okay, just enjoy it', and I'm like, 'Focus!'\"\n\nLorraine also couldn't believe the mum-of-four's confession that she doesn't enjoy football.\n\nAbbey said: \"I am a terrible WAG.\"\n\nYesterday Abbey and Sophia launched the new Lipsy line with Sophia modelling the new kids' clothing range.\n\n(Image: Lipsy / PR Handout)\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nThe pair were seen holding hands in sweet snaps taken inside a stunning stately home.\n\nOne of the shots shows the mum and daughter wearing very similar black dresses, while another features them in almost matching feathered frocks.\n\nAbbey and Peter are also parents to Liberty, four, Johnny, 20 months, and baby Jack, who was born in June.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
