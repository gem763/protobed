There's more than $17 trillion of negative-yielding debt circulating throughout the global economy. And with each passing day, those negative rates are becoming increasingly normal.\n\nBut to the CEOs of Bank of America and Blackstone, they're anything but normal \u2014 and the two are sounding the alarm on the economic alchemy they see taking place.\n\n\"I don't even know what a negative interest rate is,\" Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone, said at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum. \"This whole movement \u2014 particularly in Europe \u2014 to negative interest rates, I think, is some kind of warning sign, some kind of wake up call.\"\n\nFor the uninitiated, negative interest rates are supposed to stimulate demand by encouraging consumers and businesses to borrow and spend. After all, it will cost them to stash money in banks. It's the opposite of how lending in a positive-interest-rate environment should function.\n\nTo Schwarzman, negative rates don't make any sense. He said that instead of stimulating economies, they were having the opposite effect. What's more, their implementation is crushing banks.\n\n\"Most of those places that have those negative interest rates \u2014 it's not stimulative,\" he said. \"Banks have trouble earning money in that kind of environment, and if banks don't do well, then they don't grow their capital and they can't extend credit.\"\n\nHe added: \"Countries don't grow unless there's credit extension.\"\n\nRead more: 'The mother of all corrections': A prominent portfolio manager says the bond market's day of reckoning is nearing \u2014 and that the Fed's actions will be the cause\n\nSchwarzman isn't alone in his opinion. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan also expressed dismay over the rise of negative rates.\n\n\"We look at some of the countries where the rate structure has been negative for five years,\" Moynihan said. \"The banks still have to pay consumer depositors interest because \u2014 to Steve's point \u2014 they're not going to give us $100 and get $95 back. The reality is it's showing the weakness in economies.\"\n\nMoynihan's point is backed by data. Many of those countries that he mentioned are encompassed in the iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF (EUFN). On a five-year basis, the exchange-traded fund is down more 25%.\n\nMoreover, growth in the eurozone \u2014 a firm adopter of negative interest rates \u2014 has been anemic. It saw gross domestic product expand just 0.2% last quarter.\n\n\"I think Steve's point is right,\" Moynihan said.", "description": "Brian Moynihan and Stephen Schwarzman think negative rates are doing the exact opposite of what they're supposed to.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8cef5b2e22af63bf2a792b-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
