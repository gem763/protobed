His White House Is Pissed.", "language": "en", "text": "The formal launch of an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump has placed the president\u2019s reelection campaign and his staff at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue at diametrically different stations on the emotional spectrum.\n\nFor Trump\u2019s political and campaign team, efforts by congressional Democrats to drive the president from office are being treated internally with political euphoria. Within minutes of news that Speaker Nancy Pelosi would back impeachment proceedings, the Trump campaign was plumbing its base for money and Republican campaigns were tagging opponents who endorsed the effort as do-nothing radicals.\n\nInside the White House, an entirely different reality is now being confronted, one that involves actually dealing with the likelihood of a painful, cumbersome, intrusive battle that brings what remains of its legislative agenda to a standstill.\n\nThe president took his first official step towards dealing with the conundrum on Tuesday afternoon, when he announced that he would release the transcript of a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that has sparked the current rush towards impeachment. That apparent concession came after high-level discussions at the White House, where the prospect of impeachment-related proceedings had gone, in a matter of hours, from a remote possibility to an immediate likelihood.\n\nHours later, the White House took an even more dramatic step, agreeing to allow Congress to review a complaint filed by a whistleblower in the intelligence community who suspected some form of official wrongdoing pertaining to that phone call and other outreach by Trump allies to officials in Kyiv, as well as an inspector general report that reportedly found merit in the complaint. Politico first reported that expected release, and a White House source with knowledge of the president\u2019s thinking confirmed to The Daily Beast that the plan is to release that information to Congress this week.\n\nThe president has been loath to release any information to congressional investigators since Democrats took the majority in the House this year. But the White House official told The Daily Beast that the impending impeachment inquiry made it likely that the underlying conduct would emerge eventually. Releasing the information, the source said, positioned the president as being forthcoming and acquiescent.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say we didn\u2019t\u201d release it, the official said. \u201cWe\u2019d probably be compelled to under some select committee or some sort, so the question is how does it get out.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the White House thought the release of that call\u2019s transcript would mollify congressional Democrats, the White House official laughed.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere are some parts of the Democratic Party that have been calling for impeachment since before he was inaugurated, so the idea there will be some sort of magic bullet, I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s that naive.... So the question is how you deal with that mentality.\u201d\n\nThe source portrayed Trump\u2019s apparent concessions in allowing the release of pertinent information as a demonstration that the White House has nothing to hide. Trump, the official said, is \u201cconfident there\u2019s nothing there.\u201d\n\nThe release of the information nevertheless threatens to fuel Democratic antagonism towards the president right as Pelosi\u2019s caucus gets on board with impeachment proceedings. Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have all but admitted that they pressed Ukrainian leaders to reopen an investigation into an energy company that previously counted former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s youngest son as a board member.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the more serious allegation\u2014that Trump threatened to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine unless that investigation were reopened, a step that appears likely\u2014would constitute a crime under U.S. law. But the Constitution is vague about what constitutes the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d with which a president can be charged, and legal scholars have interpreted the term to implicate conduct beyond specific violations of federal law.\n\nPrivately, senior White House officials had long maintained that Democratic efforts to impeach Trump or aggressively probe the president, his family, his administration and his business empire would never lead to impeachment\u2014in large part because they believed Pelosi was firmly standing in the way of more aggressive members of her caucus. Those close to Trump have also watched as this year\u2019s myriad House investigations and document requests have been stonewalled or tied up in the courts by the president\u2019s legal team\u2014all without any major consequences for the president.\n\n\u201cWhat are they gonna do?\u201d a senior Trump administration official mockingly told The Daily Beast late last week. \u201cEvery investigation, everything\u2014it\u2019s been a joke.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, however, the same official took a far more dour tone, acknowledging that Trump\u2019s impeachment at the hands of the House Democratic majority was now far more likely and that this would be a colossal pain for the White House to deal with, in part because of how it will invariably affect the president\u2019s focus, actions, and mood.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, Trump posted nearly a dozen tweets complaining about Democrats\u2019 impeachment moves, including one griping about how liberals deliberately ruined and degraded his \u201cimportant day\u201d at the United Nations.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions seeking clarification on the administration\u2019s approach to an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSuch nuanced discussions of how best to approach the problem were largely absent from the president\u2019s reelection campaign, however. While some in the White House fretted over the prospect of an angered and annoyed president, the political team leapt into action in an effort to translate an impeachment inquiry into a galvanizing force for its supporters.\n\n\u201cThe misguided Democrat impeachment strategy is meant to appease their rabid, extreme, leftist base, but will only serve to embolden and energize President Trump\u2019s supporters and create a landslide victory for the President,\u201d declared Trump reelection campaign manager Brad Parscale in a statement on Tuesday evening.\n\nA joint fundraising committee for the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee sent out a fundraising solicitation midday asking for help supporting \u201cour Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.\u201d Less than two hours later, the committee sent out another, identical fundraising pitch. Ninety minutes after that, a third email was sent.\n\nAnd according to a senior RNC official, the committee\u2019s in-house research team is already compiling materials to counter-attack House Democrats, and a war room has been assembled already to respond if liberal lawmakers move ahead on Trump impeachment. In particular, the official noted, the RNC has already started targeting House Democrats\u2014in districts President Trump won\u2014for supporting impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt will be part of the [Trump reelection] campaign theme,\u201d former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA), a current Trump surrogate, said on Tuesday. \u201c\u2018Dems are about impeachment, investigations, and turning over the election, while Trump is fighting for you.\u2019\u201d", "description": "There are fears at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue about a now-dead legislative agenda and a president who may be moody.
