What the word on your wine label really means", "language": "en", "text": "These three terms are all the rage in the wine business \u2013 but they can be difficult to decipher at a glance. Here\u2019s a simple guide\n\nWine is such a simple a pleasure: the fragrance, the flavour, the mellow enjoyment of a glass over a good meal with friends. OK, some of that mellowness is chemically induced, but alcohol too is simple, as long as it\u2019s taken in moderation.\n\nSo, if drinking wine is straightforward, why must choosing it be quite so complicated? There are countries and regions and quality levels and grapes. Wine labels vary wildly: an Australian chardonnay will have the country and the grape somewhere on the label, but nothing on a typical chablis will tell you it is also made with chardonnay grapes.\n\nThere are two ways to look at this. The first is that learning is half the fun. Just as most of us wouldn\u2019t get the cultural references threaded through our language unless they were pointed out to us, so wine is a cultural artefact with a whole set of references attached. You don\u2019t need to know them, but to know them is to be part of a conversation \u2013 just as people who get Shakespeare references are participating in a 400-year discussion on the nature of Englishness.\n\nSecond, if I am going to put something in my body, and serve it to my guests, I would quite like to know what it is.\n\nThat brings us to the latest development designed to muddle the heads of the thirsty. Natural wine is all the rage: some bars are dedicated to it, while others focus on artisanal wines of all kinds, including organic or biodynamic. Which is marvellous, except that the differences between these designations are not immediately clear. If a wine is labelled biodynamic, what does that mean? And if it isn\u2019t so labelled, is it definitely not biodynamic? So here, for the terminally puzzled, is a quick guide to the new terminology.\n\nOrganic wine\n\nThis is the simplest of the new categories. Organic wine, like organic food, is made without the use of artificial pesticides, fungicides, herbicides etc, according to rules laid down by bodies such as the Soil Association. Vine-growers can promote growth and fight disease using naturally occurring products, such as sulphur dioxide, or they can introduce predators or induce sexual confusion, using pheromones to prevent moths mating and producing vine-destroying caterpillars. In the winery, they must also avoid prohibited additives.\n\nOrganic wine is relatively uncontroversial, since most winemakers and wine-drinkers who are interested in quality and sustainability agree that avoiding substances that might affect human or environmental health is a good idea. Terrible weather conditions \u2013 the droughts, frost, hail and downpours that are becoming more frequent and severe with the climate crisis \u2013 can ruin crops, tempting smaller winemakers to break the rules. Still, the thinking goes, many of the non-organic fixes will ultimately destroy the soil and the vineyard, not to mention affect the taste of the wine.\n\nTempted? Try Ch\u00e2teau Musar (Lebanon) or Domaine de la Mordor\u00e9e (France).\n\nBiodynamic wine\n\nBiodynamic winemaking follows the principles of the philosopher Rudolf Steiner and is based on the idea that, in order for it to reach its full potential, a vineyard needs to be well-balanced and harmonious. Organic is good, runs this thinking, but doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough. Some parts of the methodology are obvious; others are weird. So, crop rotation and the promotion of biodiversity make perfect sense; this is how peasants did things in feudal times, using rest and alternative crops to return nutrients to depleted soils. The spraying of infusions of natural substances including nettles, blossoms, minerals and manure on the vineyard also has an obvious logic to it: healthy soil will produce healthy grapes. However, burying cow horns packed with fermented dung in the vineyard tends to cause sniggers, as does pruning and harvesting in accordance with the phases of the moon. (Some winemakers play music to their vines at sunrise or sunset, which may or may not help the vines, but is certainly soothing for visitors.)\n\nDo biodynamics work? Many of these wines are beautiful, so their creators are clearly doing something right. If we accept that the tides are dictated by the moon\u2019s waxing and waning, why not the ripeness of grapes? The ancient Greeks and Romans harvested this way, and this wouldn\u2019t be the only example of practices discredited by contemptuous moderns who are then forced to eat, or rather drink, their words.\n\nMouth watering? Try Roederer champagne (France), Arianna Occhipinti (Italy)\n\nNatural wine\n\nThis is by far the most debated category, probably because, unlike with organic or biodynamic viticulture, there is no overseeing body that assigns certification to winemakers, and therefore very few generally accepted rules. The idea, however, is to intervene with the grape\u2019s own process as little as possible. So, in addition to avoiding synthetic chemical products, filtration (which removes particles that cloud the wine) is banned, as is the addition of industrial yeasts; only naturally occurring yeasts are permissible. Very little sulphur is added and most of the accepted tweaks are avoided. So, no sugar or enzymes are added; some wineries even refuse to regulate temperature.\n\nWhether you see this as the equivalent of athletes avoiding steroids or a senseless refusal of modern advances in winemaking is up to you: there are arguments on both sides. Sulphur dioxide, for example, is used to stabilise wines and keep them fresh, which is vital if they are travelling internationally. These days, the amount of sulphur is carefully regulated (dried fruit contains more of it than most wines, as does fruit squash).\n\nSome also struggle with the notion of no-intervention wine. Not messing around too much with a natural product is one thing, but wine is not naturally occurring \u2013 avoid intervention altogether and you get vinegar.\n\nThe result is that some natural wines are delightful, others far less so, and here you must trust your tastebuds. If some natural-wine evangelist informs you that all other wines are not just unnatural but \u201cdead\u201d, my advice is to run away.\n\nStill thirsty? Try Ochota Barrels (Australia), Terroir Al Limit (Spain)\n\nBear in mind that not all winemakers who adopt these practices choose to get certification, which is expensive and time-consuming to acquire and easy to forfeit (one spray, in a difficult season, and all the hard work and financial outlay is for nothing). If in doubt, ask. Nobody is using, or not using, these definitions with the aim of confusing consumers. On the contrary, winemakers and wine-sellers are proud to be offering the best wines they can, and they want you to know what they are doing. They just don\u2019t always find the clearest ways to tell you.", "description": "These three terms are all the rage in the wine business \u2013 but they can be difficult to decipher at a glance.
