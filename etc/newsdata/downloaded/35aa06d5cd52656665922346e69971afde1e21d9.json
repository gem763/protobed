Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!\"\n\n", "description": "Trump Cancels Plan to Hold G7 at His Miami Golf Club", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/21/2019102100381_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
