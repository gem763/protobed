Wendy had tried so hard to escape that she broke her fingers beating on the door, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.\n\nWilber reportedly escaped unhurt.\n\nHe told KGTV he awoke to find his bed on fire and tried yelling at his family to get them out of the burning home.\n\n\"My dogs were jumping on me, trying to wake me up.

I jumped out of bed and started screaming the house is on fire,\" Romero told the outlet.\n\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA OIL FACILITY FIRE CAUSES AUTHORITIES TO DECLARE HAZMAT EMERGENCY, ORDER RESIDENTS TO STAY INSIDE\n\nLater, in an interview with KFMB, Wilber continued to deny he had anything to do with the fire.\n\n\"You can lock me up, but you're not going to take me in for me to say this: 'I did it,'\" he said. \"I'm not going to say it because I didn't do it.\"\n\nWilber was questioned by police after the fire, but they let him go before his eventual arrest, KNSD added. Neighbors say they saw Wilber running down the street screaming when they recalled the heartbreaking scene.\n\n\"I thought it was like a scary movie. I thought it was a nightmare, honestly. I\u2019m just like, 'This is not real.
