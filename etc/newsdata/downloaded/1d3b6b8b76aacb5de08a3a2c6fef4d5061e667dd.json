But for many Californians, it is beginning to feel familiar: huddling in the dark because of pre-emptive power shut-offs, or getting ready to do so.\n\nHundreds of thousands of customers of California\u2019s three investor-owned utilities \u2014 Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric \u2014 endured blackouts on Thursday as the companies sought to prevent their equipment from igniting wildfires.\n\nAs PG&E prepared to inspect lines and restore power to 179,000 customers, mostly in Northern California, whose electricity had been shut off, Edison was beginning pre-emptive blackouts at the other end of the state that it said could affect almost 400,000 rate payers. The actual number of people losing power is generally much higher because each residential customer represents a household.\n\nAnd with high winds blowing through much of the state, the fire threat was far from hypothetical. More than 10,000 acres were ablaze in Sonoma County from a fire of undetermined origin, forcing an evacuation of Geyserville, a town of 1,000 residents 75 miles north of San Francisco.", "description": "With wildfire hazards high and one major blaze reported, utility companies continued to shut off power to keep their equipment from causing a disaster.", "authors": ["Ivan Penn", "Carol Pogash"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/business/24utility2/24utility2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
