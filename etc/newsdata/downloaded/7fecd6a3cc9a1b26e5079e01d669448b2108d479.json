China is set to have the most at 61.9million, followed by India at 27.4million. The US comes in third at 16.9million, while the UK is 36th with 1.3million\n\nEasy access to fast food, increasing screen time and 'more motorised transport' have been blamed for spiraling rates of obesity worldwide.\n\nExperts warn the pandemic will 'overwhelm' health services, with many countries being 'unable to cope' with the demand of diabetes drugs and weight-loss surgery.\n\nThe authors said: 'The increase shows a critical failure of government to respect and protect our children\u2019s rights to good health. We can do better, and we must.'\n\nMore than one in five children in the UK are overweight or obese when they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave, NHS statistics show.\n\nAnd in the US, nearly one in five (18.5 per cent) two-to-19 year olds are dangerously overweight, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nObese children are more at risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, breathing difficulties, bone and joint problems, and even type 2 diabetes.\n\nThey are also more likely to have weight problems as adults, which could shorten their life.\n\nTo uncover how the issue may affect generations to come, the WOF and NCD Risk Factor Collaboration created risk scores for 191 countries.\n\nThis was based on existing obesity statistics and known risk factors for the condition, like maternal smoking and breastfeeding rates.\n\nIn data shared with The Guardian, the team found 158million two-to-19 year olds will be obese across the world next year.\n\nThis is expected to rise to 206million in 2025 and 254million in 2030, according to the Atlas of Childhood Obesity report.\n\nChina is expected to be the worst hit, with 32 per cent of five-to-nine year olds and 21.8 per cent of 10-to-19 year olds expected to obese in just over a decade.\n\nThe report gives the country a zero per cent chance of hitting the World Health Organization's target of 'no increase in obesity prevalence by 2025'.\n\nIn the UK, 12.4 per cent of children aged five-to-nine are expected to be dangerously overweight in 11 years time, with the issue also affecting 10.3 per cent of 10-to-19 year olds.\n\nAnd in the US, more than a quarter (26.3 per cent) of five-to-nine and 24.2 per cent of 10-to-19 year olds are expected to be obese.\n\nThe countries were given a 39 per cent and 17 per cent chance of hitting the 2025 target, respectively.\n\nJust one in 10 of the countries featured were given a 50 per cent likelihood of meeting the target. And the odds of 156 of the nations were less than 10 per cent.\n\nCOUNTRIES EXPECTED TO HAVE THE BIGGEST OBESITY PROBLEM AMONG CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS IN 2030 Rank Country Obesity prevalence 1 China 61,987,920 2 India 27,481,141 3 US 16,986,603 4 Indonesia 9,076,416 5 Brazil 7,664,422 6 Egypt 6,818,532 7 Mexico 6,550,276 8 Nigeria 6,020,182 9 Pakistan 5,412,457 10 South Africa 4,146,329\n\nThe report suggests obesity will largely affect less developed countries.\n\nAfter China, India and the US, the top 10 is made up of Indonesia, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa.\n\nThe authors also gave the countries a risk score of having an obesity crisis in the next decade.\n\nThe Cook Islands, Kiribati, Micronesia, Niue, Palau, Puerto Rico, Swaziland and Tokelau all scored the maximum 11 points. New Zealand followed close behind at 10.5.\n\nBoth the UK and US were placed in the 'red zone', with 7.5 and 8.5 points, respectively.\n\nTim Lobstein, an author of the report, claims the 'rising tide' of obesity has not been efficiently addressed by policies that encourage healthy living and restrict junk food marketing to young people.\n\nHe likened the situation to 'global overheating', in the sense there is 'resistance to intervene' even for the greater good.\n\nWith the rising rates of obesity in young people comes an increasing need for related treatments.\n\n'In many countries, the health services won\u2019t cope,' Mr Lobstein said.\n\nHe blames global manufacturers of soft drinks and processed food for fueling the problem.\n\nLouise Baur, head of child and adolescent health at the University of Sydney, agreed, adding: 'We were seeing the rise of convenience foods, more motorised transport, fewer kids biking and walking, the rise of sedentary pursuits and the use of screens by children'.\n\nHIGHEST PREDICTED PREVALENCE OF OBESITY AMONG CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS IN 2030 Country % obese five-to-nine year olds % obese teenagers Cook Islands 45.9 41.6 Niue 44.8 40.9 Palau 44.7 40.1 Nauru 43.3 39.4 Tuvalu 42.8 38.2 Marshall Islands 41.1 35.4 Tonga 41 36.9 Tokelau 40.5 36.7 Kiribati 38.7 33.1 Micronesia 37.6 32.1", "description": "China is expected to be the worst affected, with an estimated 61.9million obese five-to-19 year olds in just over a decade.
