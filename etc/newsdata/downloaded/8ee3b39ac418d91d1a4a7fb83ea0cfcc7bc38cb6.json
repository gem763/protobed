NEW ZEALAND OUT.\n\nBy Yimou Lee\n\nTAIPEI (Reuters) - The Solomon Islands\u2019 government has cut official ties with Taiwan in a new blow to President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January amid rising tension with China.\n\nTaiwan now has formal relations with only 16 countries worldwide, but China claims Taiwan as its territory and says it has no right to formal ties with any nation.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, told reporters in Taipei late on Monday that it would immediately close down its embassy in the Solomon Islands and recall all of its diplomats.\n\nWu said China was aiming to meddle with Taiwan\u2019s presidential and legislative elections in January with \u201cdollar diplomacy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government attacked Taiwan purposely before our presidential and legislative elections, obviously aiming to meddle with the voting. The government strongly condemns this and urges people to hold on to its sovereignty and the value of freedom and democracy,\u201d Wu said.\n\n\u201cTaiwan has never bowed to pressure from one single setback, and it won\u2019t be defeated by this blow,\u201d Wu said, urging support from allies in the region to defend Taiwan\u2019s much-valued freedom and democracy.\n\nSolomon Islands is the sixth country Taiwan will lose as a diplomatic ally since Tsai came to office in 2016 \u2014 following Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama and El Salvador.\n\nTsai, who\u2019s facing an uphill battle in January\u2019s vote, has been criticised over her handling of Beijing, who suspects of her pushing for Taiwan\u2019s formal independence.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe move came after the Solomon Islands\u2019 months-long review of the pros and cons of a switch to Beijing, which was offering $8.5 million in development funds to replace support from Taiwan.\n\nThe Solomons Prime Minister\u2019s office did not immediately respond to questions.\n\nA switch in allegiance would be a prize for Beijing in its campaign to secure allies from Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan vowed to fight China\u2019s \u201cincreasingly out of control\u201d behaviour after El Salvador switched its allegiance to Beijing last year.", "description": "The Solomon Islands' government has cut official ties with Taiwan in a new blow to President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January amid rising tension with China.", "authors": ["Yimou Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430418021&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0P0", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
