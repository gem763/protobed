Thank you for welcoming me into you inbox yet again.\n\nLast week, I talked about the eternal dumbness of the smart home and how Google had a big chance to lay out their vision this past week. Guess what? They did not, instead we got a new more expensive Google Wifi that falls under the Nest brand as well as a Google Mini that can be wall-mounted\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox here, and follow my tweets here.\n\nThe big story\n\nZuckerberg had an interesting week, delivering a very rehearsed keynote that was neither in front of Congress or an audience of developers at F8. He spoke at Georgetown on the topic of free speech and Facebook\u2019s brand of capitalism.\n\nIt was an odd speech, but it was an opportunity for him to speak at length about what he saw as Facebook\u2019s mission in terms of free speech\n\n\u201cThese two simple ideas \u2014 voice and inclusion \u2014 go hand in hand. We\u2019ve seen this throughout history, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way today. More people being able to share their perspectives has always been necessary to build a more inclusive society. And our mutual commitment to each other \u2014 that we hold each others\u2019 right to express our views and be heard above our own desire to always get the outcomes we want \u2014 is how we make progress together. But this view is increasingly being challenged. Some people believe giving more people a voice is driving division rather than bringing us together. More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes they think matter is more important than every person having a voice. I think that\u2019s dangerous. Today I want to talk about why, and some important choices we face around free expression.\n\nThroughout history, we\u2019ve seen how being able to use your voice helps people come together. We\u2019ve seen this in the civil rights movement. Frederick Douglass once called free expression \u201cthe great moral renovator of society\u201d. He said \u201cslavery cannot tolerate free speech\u201d. Civil rights leaders argued time and again that their protests were protected free expression, and one noted: \u201cnearly all the cases involving the civil rights movement were decided on First Amendment grounds\u201d.\n\nFacebook is in an interesting position here, where they\u2019re tying a moral stance with an economic one. They seem to draw the line at paid ads and paid political speech whereas everything before it was so nuanced. I don\u2019t like that very much.\n\nUnrestricted speech on the internet has been an evolving topic. There\u2019s the very real argument that giving people a megaphone to harass and bully minimizes other people\u2019s ability to have unrestricted speech themselves. Facebook and most of the other major platforms have agreed with this and have put policies in place.\n\nThere\u2019s also the situation where someone is threatening or discussing violence or hate speech. Again, Facebook goes further than the law requires and has this firmly in their policies.\n\nIf you look at the company\u2019s existing policies that have been put in place over the past few years, you would find plenty of guidelines at odds with sections of Zuck\u2019s speech and yet he seemed to be drawing a big red line here and now, with the only reason being the criticism of Facebook\u2019s ad policy that allowed Donald Trump to pay for and target ads that were ostensibly untrue.\n\nI wrote about the situation in full here and it rings true again after Zuckerberg\u2019s speech. Timing is everything and it\u2019s hard to take this moral stance seriously right now especially.\n\nSend me feedback\n\non Twitter @lucasmtny or email\n\nlucas@techcrunch.com\n\nOn to the rest of the week\u2019s news.\n\nTrends of the week\n\nHere are a few big news items from big companies, with green links to all the sweet, sweet added context:\n\nSprint + T-Mobile = official best friends\n\nThe FCC has reportedly decided to let another massive merger go through (after some decent concessions), allowing T-Mobile and Sprint to proceed in their massive telecom merger.\n\nThe FCC has reportedly decided to let another massive merger go through (after some decent concessions), allowing T-Mobile and Sprint to proceed in their massive telecom merger.
