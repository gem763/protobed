Whale Wisdom has comprised what it calls the WhaleIndex, which is a portfolio of the 100 highest-conviction stocks held by leading hedge fund managers, as shown in quarterly 13-F filings. Since 2006, the WhaleIndex has returned about 370%, crushing the 200% S&P 500 return over that same time frame.\n\nClearly, following the smart money has been the smart move. No pun intended.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at seven stocks that Whale Wisdom says hedge funds love. That is, the seven highest-conviction stocks that hedge funds own the most of, as of second-quarter 13-F filings.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying: Microsoft (MSFT)\n\nBest Stocks That Hedge Funds Are Buying: Microsoft (MSFT) More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe most owned stock among hedge funds is technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with an aggregate second quarter 13-F holding value of $735 billion.\n\nThis seems like an obvious choice for smart money. Microsoft is a blue chip technology giant which has been around forever, has a huge ecosystem of products and services, and most importantly, has found its growth stride again through enterprise cloud services migration and expansion. The company consistently beats Street estimates, has a long track record of cloud-driven double-digit revenue growth, and is benefiting from upside margin drivers which are driving even bigger profit growth.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the fundamentals supporting MSFT stock. Perhaps the best thing to like is the valuation. Even with all these favorable attributes, MSFT stock still trades at just just 22.8-times forward earnings \u2014 a bargain for a mega-cap, big-growth cloud stock.\n\nAll in all, then, it makes sense that the smart money loves Microsoft stock. This is a big company with big growth drivers trading at a very reasonable valuation. That\u2019s a winning combination that has propelled the stock 100% higher over the past three years. It should propel similarly large gains going forward, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nBest Stocks That Hedge Funds Are Buying: Apple (AAPL) More\n\nSource: mama_mia / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe second-most owned stock among hedge funds is consumer technology giant Apple (NADSAQ:APPL), with an aggregate second quarter 13-F holding value of $550 billion.\n\nAnother obvious choice for smart money, Apple has many of the same winning characteristics as Microsoft. This is a blue-chip technology giant with a long track record of growth, and which has created an ecosystem of consumer technology hardware products that over a billion people around the world use every day. The first part of the Apple growth narrative was all about building out that hardware ecosystem. The second part \u2014 which the company is transitioning to now \u2014 is all about monetizing that ecosystem with software subscription services, like Apple TV+ and Apple Music.\n\nIn other words, this company has a history of a big growth, and a very smart game-plan to sustain that big growth for the foreseeable future. At the same time, software businesses carry higher margins than hardware businesses, so this pivot to software-focused growth is also additive to margins and should super-charge profit growth.\n\nStory continues", "description": "One of the most widely used phrases in the investment world is \"follow the smart money,\" and it broadly means that investors would be wise to follow the investments of hedge funds and institutional investors (the \"smart money\").As hedge fund tracking site Whale Wisdom shows us, following", "authors": ["Luke Lango"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a1aW0Twb5W8jd46GElxdKQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/investorplace_417/4368f5bfc5e71926b6ae829c7af9aa9d", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
