(Getty Images)\n\n2019 has been a hellish season for Tennessee fans. The Volunteers opened the season with a 38-30 loss to Georgia State, a team that was 2-10 in the Sun Belt in 2018.\n\nThe next week, the Tennessee defense had an epic blown coverage that let BYU get in position for a game-tying field goal. The Cougars then took their first lead of the game on the winning score in overtime.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWeek 3 was a reprieve with a win over FCS school Chattanooga. But Week 4 was a brutal 34-3 loss at Florida in the Vols first SEC game of the year. It\u2019s the first time Tennessee has started the season 1-3 since 2008. That was the final season of now-athletic director Phillip Fulmer\u2019s time as head coach.\n\nWith those details in mind, you\u2019ll probably be surprised to learn that Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt thinks the team is miles ahead of where it was through four weeks of the 2018 season when UT was 2-2 and coming off a 26-point loss to Florida.\n\n\u201cOur football team is a hundred times better than it was this time last year, OK? And our guys are working hard,\u201d Pruitt said Wednesday. We\u2019re stronger, we\u2019re more physical. But when it comes to having success winning a football game, you can\u2019t turn the ball over and you have to create turnovers.\u201d\n\nTennessee is plus-one in the turnover margin category so far in 2019 but that statistic is extremely misleading. The Vols forced five turnovers in the 45-0 win over Chattanooga and didn\u2019t turn the ball over once. Against FBS opponents, Tennessee has turned the ball over eight times and forced just four.\n\nOh, and three of those turnovers forced came against Florida on Saturday. They sure didn\u2019t help much when it came to the margin of victory.\n\nGuarantano briefly benched against Florida\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo of Tennessee\u2019s four turnovers against Florida came via interceptions thrown by QB Jarrett Guarantano.\n\nGuarantano entered the 2019 season as the team\u2019s undisputed starter but has failed to build on the flashes of promise he showed at the end of the 2018 season. He briefly sat out against Florida as freshman Brian Maurer got playing time. Maurer was the QB on the drive that led to Tennessee\u2019s only field goal of the game, though Guarantano re-entered after Maurer threw 11 passes.\n\nEntering its first off week, Pruitt said the coaching staff is dividing up first-team reps among Guarantano, Maurer and J.T. Shrout.\n\n\u201cJarrett has not been probably as good as he\u2019d like to be at certain times but he\u2019s also made some really good throws and made some really good decisions,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cNo different than maybe the defensive line, linebackers, secondary, whatever.\u201d \u201cEverybody in our program\u2019s got to raise their level. We\u2019ve got to be more consistent. And we\u2019ve got to create the right habits so it shows up on game day.\u201d\n\nPruitt also confirmed that three players had left the team, including LB Will Ignont. He had 16 tackles over the first three weeks of the season. Five players overall have left since the beginning of the year.\n\nThings don\u2019t get any easier in the next few weeks\n\nWhile the off week may be coming at a good time for Tennessee to get some things figured out on both sides of the ball, the schedule is pretty tough when it picks back up on Oct. 5. No. 3 Georgia comes to Knoxville in Week 5 and then Mississippi State is at Tennessee in Week 6 before the Volunteers travel to No. 2 Alabama in Week 7.\n\nThere\u2019s an extremely real possibility Tennessee will be 1-6 before facing South Carolina and UAB at home.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Tennessee is 1-3 for the first time since 2008, the final season of now-athletic director Phillip Fulmer's coaching tenure.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6T3TRAa3qAZ.2LE298I0FQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SbDifraABi3QuwlreBl4Yg--~B/aD0yOTU3O3c9NDQzNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/0565ec80-dff8-11e9-affb-5f449b61817e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
