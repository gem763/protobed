Elizabeth Warren is a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic primary race and, according to polling aggregation site RealClearPolitics, she and former vice president Joe Biden are virtually tied in national polls.\n\nAs her campaign has gained traction, a story that Warren often tells on the campaign trail \u2014 about getting fired from her first teaching job for being pregnant \u2014 has been put in the spotlight. The story has resonated, at least in part, because pregnancy discrimination is still common today.\n\nIn 1970, Warren, who studied at the University of Houston to become a public school teacher, got her first teaching job as a part-time speech pathologist for special-needs children in Riverdale, New Jersey. She said she was not offered the position the following year because she was visibly pregnant with her daughter, Amelia.\n\nConservative websites have accused Warren of lying, highlighting minutes from a Riverdale Board of Education meeting in April 1971 that states the board unanimously approved Warren to work two days per week, as well as minutes from a June 1971 meeting that state Warren's resignation was \"accepted with regret.\"\n\n(Warren gave birth to her daughter in September of 1971, so it is likely that she was not visibly pregnant when her contract was extended in April, but was visibly pregnant when she left the role in June.)\n\nThe senator has since stood by her story.\n\n\"When I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize. By June I was visibly pregnant \u2014 and the principal told me the job I'd already been promised for the next year would go to someone else,\" wrote Warren on Twitter.\n\n\"This was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination \u2014 but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours.\"", "description": "As Sen.
