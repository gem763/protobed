It feels like a natural extension of the city\u2019s energy, both practical and in-your-face.\n\nWhat would convince someone in Milan, or Tokyo, or Beijing, though, to put on a puffer coat in the morning when they\u2019re getting dressed? Someone whose style is more minimal? Or punk? Or preppy? The Italian heritage brand Moncler has been working for decades to bring luxury performance outerwear down from the mountain and onto the streets, and this was the challenge in-house designers Veronica Leoni and Sergio Zambon faced for the 2 Moncler 1952 collection, which debuted in New York on Wednesday.\n\nLeoni, who was dressed in a roomy beige dress, said she started with herself as muse. What kind of Moncler puffer coat would a woman who wears Phoebe Philo earrings, for example, want in her closet? The answer was a quilted tunic of the same shade of beige, with a drawstring waist. She also created a lovely white coat with a ginkgo leaf print, and reimagined the motorcycle jacket and the classic tweed Chanel coat, merging uptown and downtown aesthetics.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Moncler\n\nFor menswear, Zambon channeled the ease and flair of the 1970s with tie-dye and fringe. (Like Leoni, he may have been inspired by himself \u2014 he was wearing a pair of \u201970s-inspired, orange-tinted aviator glasses.) \u201cIn Italy, they used to call the hippies \u2018freaks,\u2019\u201d he said of a fleece jacket with the word printed in all caps across it. He meant it in the best possible way.\n\nWhat brought the two collections together was a new collaboration with the Italian handbag brand Valextra, which is also based in Milan and was founded in 1937. CEO Sara Ferrero said the pairing was natural. \u201cI see something I like and I\u2019m like, \u2018Ooh! I\u2019m going to see if we can do a collaboration.\u2019\u201d The collection includes quilted cross-body straps and weekend bags, perfect for travel. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal interest that becomes a real interest for the company, so it\u2019s honest,\u201d Ferrero added. \u201cI think it\u2019s that honesty that engages myself, the team, and then ultimately, the public.\u201d The collection sold out in three days in Japan and China, so mission accomplished.
