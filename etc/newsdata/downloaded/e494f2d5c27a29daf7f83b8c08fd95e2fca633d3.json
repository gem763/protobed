What\u2019s constantly evolving is how they consume information and how they shop. \u201d \u2014Chris Grainger-Herr\n\nAnother important aspect Grainger-Herr has been working on is to improve the brand\u2019s sustainability practices, \u201cbecause young luxury consumers are increasingly aware of corporate social responsibility and environmental impact, so are we,\u201d he says.\n\nPenta sat down with Grainger-Herr, 41, at IWC Schaffhausen\u2019s flagship store on Madison Avenue in Manhattan to talk about the watchmaker\u2019s sustainability practices.\n\nPenta : What were you involved in before you became CEO?\n\nGrainger-Herr: My background is in interior and architectural design. Over the years, I designed a lot of office spaces, exhibitions, and global trade shows. Then I served as Executive Brand Architect for IWC, spearheading the design of the new museum-style manufacturing site, which was completed last year.\n\nFrom there, I also did marketing, media, and sales. The announcement of promoting me to the CEO came in fall 2016. And I got officially appointed in April 2017.\n\nHow do you lead the heritage brand?\n\nThe company was founded in 1868 by American watchmaker Florentine Ariosto Jones to combine state-of-the-art American manufacturing technology back in the day with Swiss-quality craftsmanship. Although we are over 150 years old, sometimes it's interesting to see how you can be very modern with something that has a lot of heritage.\n\nOne of the most challenging tasks is to maneuver the constant interplay between the engineering and the storytelling\u2014or the technical side and the emotional side\u2014of luxury watches. The pieces have to be really beautiful, highly functional and able to evoke emotions. When math/science comes at the most simplest perfection, it is very close to art.\n\nWhat we make is quite unique, in terms of product sustainability. We design and make timeless products in the heart of Switzerland in a very responsible way, with responsibly-sourced materials, and making them last forever. Our perpetual watch needs first adjustment in 2499. After that, we'll be happy to service it for our clients for at least another thousand years.\n\nIn terms of marketing strategy, we do notice certain consumer trends and market our products accordingly. At tier-one cities in China now, there's been a sudden appetite for sports watches and large watches, which mainly wasn't the case years ago. So obviously we start to pivot our communication away from the classical heritage feel and towards a bit more to the sports side.\n\nThe two pilots on Silver Spitfire\u2014The Longest Flight are equipped with IWC\u2019s limited edition, The Timezoner Spitfire. IWC Schaffhausen\n\nTell us more about the company\u2019s sustainable practices?\n\nFirst of all, the new IWC manufacturing sites use 100% renewable electricity from grid and rooftop solar panels. We seek to reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions by 10% by 2020, compared to a 2018 baseline.\n\nIn terms of sourcing, we're working towards fully transparent and responsible practices, from the supply chain of raw materials all the way to the finished product.\n\nWe are also making some small changes that have big environmental impacts. For example, we have a brand-new packaging concept that not only is made from mostly recycled plastic, but also is about a quarter of the size of the original packaging. If you just calculate the amount of shipment, the weight and volume of the watches that we're sending around the planet, we already have massive improvements.\n\nAny philanthropic/social goods projects the company focuses on?\n\nIn addition to the importance IWC puts on sustainability, the brand has a proven history of partnerships that work toward a common goal of bettering the world. Many of IWC\u2019s watch collections are inspired by their partner organizations and contribute to a greater cause.\n\nOne of our partners is the Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry Youth Foundation, which is committed to helping children and young people in disadvantaged circumstances. IWC contributes to the financing of the foundation\u2019s social projects by auctioning off unique pieces and creating limited edition collections. This year, we offered a wristwatch worn by Bradley Cooper during the Oscars for auction at Sotheby\u2019s, which raised $75,000 for the foundation.\n\nIWC is also the main sponsor of Silver Spitfire\u2014The Longest Flight, in partnership with the Boultbee Flight Academy. Our brand has previously commemorated the Spitfire plane, a British single-seat fighter aircraft used by the Royal Air Force and other Allied countries before, during, and after World War II, with several special-edition watches.\n\nFor the \u201cThe Longest Flight,\u201d which took off from Goodwood, U.K. in August, two pilots are taking several months and visiting some 30 countries. The two pilots are equipped with IWC\u2019s limited edition, The Timezoner Spitfire.", "description": "The chief executive is finding new ways to meet consumers\u2019 changing habits", "authors": ["Fang Block", "Chris Grainger-Herr"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-103206/social"}
