In response to a question about Warren, Harris said at a closed-door fundraiser it was hypocritical for her rival to claim she wasn\u2019t taking money from large donors when Warren transferred around $10 million from her Senate funds before denouncing big money donations. Harris moved $1.2 million into her presidential fund. Harris lamented that she now needs to be in places like New York to keep the campaign financially afloat but prefers to spend time in early voting states.\n\nOn a later press call, Harris\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t name Warren directly but noted repeatedly that Harris came into the campaign with less than other candidates because \u201cwe spent 2018 raising for other candidates.\u201d\n\nBut Warren also bankrolled other Democrats: She raised and donated $11 million for downballot Democrats nationwide, and the New Hampshire party has credited her \u201csignificant support\u201d for helping them flip the state House and Senate in 2018.\n\nINSIDE MARK ZUCKERBERG\u2019S DINNER with senators: The Facebook CEO asked Sen. Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, to arrange a dinner with senators to discuss election security, consumer-data protection and social-media competition.\n\nThey kept the group small at eight people\u2014Zuckerberg and senators including Richard Blumenthal \u2014dining around the table for two hours at Ris, a New American bistro located by the Ritz-Carlton in Washington\u2019s West End. Their menu included mushroom-crusted Icelandic cod and bittersweet chocolate semifreddo.\n\nThe meal cost $100 a person. It\u2019s unclear who picked up the tab. Zuckerberg was in town to press senators on their plans for regulating internet giants.\n\nISRAELI ELECTIONS could yield wins for Democratic consultants and a loss for Trump\u2019s pollster. Joel Benenson, known for his work for Hillary Clinton, guides center-left Blue and White party to a neck-and-neck result with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2019s Likud party, pending coalition negotiations. Netanyahu accused Benenson of delivering a \u201cfalse leak\u201d in the campaign\u2019s final days about Israel spying on the White House, which Benenson denied.\n\nMark Mellman, known for his work for former Sen. Harry Reid and an informal adviser to Blue and White, told the Journal he has high hopes for Democrats\u2019 ties to Israel in a post-Netanyahu era: \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for Israel to reset its relationship with Democrats.\u201d But he said a new government wouldn\u2019t change the relationship with Israel\u2019s \u201cimplacable foes\u201d in Congress, such as Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib.\n\nJohn McLaughlin, a Trump pollster, appeared with Netanyahu in the campaign\u2019s final days to warn of low right-wing voter turnout.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign will continue to rise in the polls?

Ambassador Stavros Lambrinidis reminded the audience, including members of Congress and Kentucky politicians, that the EU was the biggest source of foreign investment in Kentucky and a growing importer of whiskey. Guests got a swag bag containing a \u201cRecipe for export growth.\u201d\n\nBIG CHALLENGES for Sen. Bernie Sanders appear in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll: He leads among young Democratic voters, but is the top choice of just 3% of voters over 50 and 5% of African-Americans, two crucial groups in party primaries.\n\nMARK YOUR CALENDARS: The papers of Justice John Paul Stevens, who died in July, will begin opening to the public in October 2020. They\u2019ll offer insights into the inner workings of the Supreme Court that decided epochal cases such as Bush v. Gore. The Library of Congress will open files extending through Sept. 30, 2005, starting next year, with papers covering the justice\u2019s final five years on the court set to open in 2030.\n\nMINOR MEMOS: Warren cheers\u2014but silently, because she is in the quiet car of Amtrak\u2019s Acela\u2014to celebrate Working Families Party endorsement. \u2026 Joe Biden jokes that where he grew up, \u201cyou either became a firefighter, a cop, a tradesman or a priest\u2014but I wasn\u2019t qualified for any of those.\u201d \u2026 Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski reproaches Rep.
