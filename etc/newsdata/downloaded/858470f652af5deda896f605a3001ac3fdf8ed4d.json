Gorsuch, like any other good angler, isn\u2019t about to talk about his best fishing spots. But he is willing to dish on his favorite fly.\n\nThe Copper John is what gets them snapping in Colorado, he tells reporters before revealing one of his prized possessions: a fly the Copper John creator tied just for him, dubbed the Copper Neil, kept in his chambers at the Supreme Court at 1 First St. in Washington, far from his fishing grounds.\n\nThe Colorado native became the first justice in nearly a decade to come from a flyover state, breaking the hold the coasts have had on the institution when he ascended from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Denver, to the high court in 2017 as President Trump\u2019s first pick, succeeding the late Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nAs he writes in his new book, \u201cA Republic, If You Can Keep It,\u201d he inherited more than Scalia\u2019s seat. He also got the late justice\u2019s massive elk head, bagged on a hunting trip and for years displayed in his office.\n\nJustice Gorsuch says in his book that the head, known as Leroy, is so massive that the court must have been looking for a gracious exit for the thing, when someone settled on the idea of gifting it to the new justice. Justice Gorsuch couldn\u2019t be happier because he and Leroy have much in common.\n\n\u201cWe are both native Coloradans. Neither of us will ever forget Justice Scalia. And we\u2019ve both been crated and jumbled across the country to serve out our remaining time on display at the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d he said in a lecture about his experience joining the high court \u2014 one of the compiled speeches and writings that make up his book.\n\nJustice Gorsuch said he and Scalia never went hunting, but they did fish together once.\n\nThey also gained some insights, realizing that they may approach the law and judge similarly \u2014 the reason Mr. Trump selected the Coloradan \u2014 but they had a different way of fishing.\n\n\u201cWhere I would suggest, say, gently unfurling a line in the direction of a rising trout, Justice Scalia preferred another approach: lashing the stream with the enthusiasm of a son of Queens. When I pointed to a spot likely to harbor trout, instead of stalking slowly in that direction he would storm over in his waders, look around, and then exclaim, \u2018But you said there would be fish here!\u2019 As indeed there had been.\u201d\n\nJustice Gorsuch shies away from suggesting that being from the Mountain West means he decides cases differently, but he does suggest it offers a judge a different perspective.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to explain to my colleagues on the 10th Circuit when I\u2019m telling an anecdote what a prairie dog is,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also made history by hiring the first American Indian Supreme Court clerk for the 2018 term, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nThe justice has won praise for his fluid writing on the high court, though he has kept observers guessing to some extent with his rulings, siding with the court\u2019s four Democrat-appointed members in cases finding a series of criminal and immigration laws too vague to stand.\n\nIt was Justice Gorsuch, though, who found himself surprised by one of the court\u2019s more playful moments in the last term when Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who sits next to him on the dais during oral arguments, was discussing the finer points of levels of force.\n\nTo illustrate her point, she reached over and pinched Justice Gorsuch, setting the courtroom atwitter. Reporters in their stories debated whether Justice Gorsuch was bemused or amused.\n\nHe waves away the speculation, saying he doesn\u2019t read that sort of coverage. He also wouldn\u2019t reveal whether he has any retaliation planned when the court convenes early next month for its next session. But he said he would welcome another from his seatmate.\n\n\u201cI adore Sonia Sotomayor, and if she wants to pinch me, that\u2019s just great,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
