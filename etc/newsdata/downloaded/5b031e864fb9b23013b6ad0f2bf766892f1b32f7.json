(Yasmine Mehdi/CBC)\n\nConcerns growing among riders\n\nIn all, there were nine hours of service disruptions last week on both rail lines. That has public transit advocate Anne-Marie Roy concerned people will end up taking their car instead of braving the network.\n\n\"Not everyone can get away with getting to work late and telling your boss, 'Sorry, it was the LRT.' I think it's really important we have a reliable transit system,\" she said.\n\nOC Transpo should discuss the issues with the Rideau Transit Group (RTG), the consortium that built the Confederation Line, Roy added.\n\n\"One of my big concerns is winter is coming,\" she said. \"If we're having all of these issues right now, what is this going to look like when we have our first snowfall?\"\n\n'Dreading winter'\n\nRoy isn't the only one worried, however.\n\n\"It's not reliable, it's not convenient, I bet you anything it's going to get stuck in the winter,\" said Jehanal Barakani, as she made her way out of Parliament station.\n\n\"I'm still dreading winter with the train,\" added Shari Scott, another rider.\n\nRideau-Vanier councillor Mathieu Fleury calls the LRT delays 'unacceptable' and is urging OC Transpo to be more transparent about what's causing them. (Yasmine Mehdi/CBC )\n\n'They have every right to be angry'\n\nOttawa Mayor Jim Watson said Saturday he's expressed his frustration with John Manconi, general manager of OC Transpo.\n\n\n\nWatson said that with \"every new system, there are obviously new challenges.\" And while the \"vast majority\" of riders have had a positive experience, some commuters have had a tougher time, he said.\n\n\n\n\"They're angry, and they have every right to be angry. And we've got to do better,\" said Watson.\n\nWe want them to give us the confidence ... that this investment was worthwhile. - Mathieu Fleury\n\n\n\n\n\nWatson said reprogramming work on the trains \u2014 which he expects will be complete by next Saturday \u2014 will make the doors less sensitive and should minimize delays.\n\n\n\nThe councillor for Rideau-Vanier, Mathieu Fleury, is also growing frustrated.\n\nFleury said OC Transpo should be more forthcoming about \"what they are going to do in the short term\" to increase reliability .\n\n\"We want them to give us the confidence ... that this investment was worthwhile,\" he said.\n\nOC Transpo should present its next LRT update on Nov. 6 at the city's transit commission meeting.", "description": "Immobilized trains, faulty\u00a0doors, computer failures and track switch issues: the list of problems with the city's train service seems to be getting longer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5316356.1570724971!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ottawa-light-rail-delay-lrt-confederation-line.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
