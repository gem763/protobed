He had initially said the murderer had displayed \u201cno behavioural problems\u201d or prompted any \u201calerts\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday lunchtime, Mickael Harpon, 45, a computer expert who had worked for 20 years in the Paris police\u2019s intelligence directorate, stabbed to death four colleagues - three officers and an administrative worker - before being shot dead by a police trainee.\n\nParis prosecutor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ricard said Harpon had been in contact with members of Salafism, an ultra-conservative branch of Sunni Islam, and defended \"atrocities committed in the name of that religion\u201d.\n\nYet he worked in a section of the police service dedicated to collecting information on jihadist radicalisation.\n\nHarpon held a high-level \"defence secrets\" security clearance, which authorised him to handle sensitive information of national defence importance and would have subjected him to regular, stringent security checks.\n\nHe had supported the Charlie Hebdo attacks in 2015 and had changed his attire in recent months, shunning \"all Western clothes in favour of traditional garments to visit the mosque\", said Mr Ricard in a press conference on Saturday.\n\nThe revelations prompted Edouard Philippe, the prime minister, to launch two internal inquiries. The first will probe the intelligence directorate, DRPP, where Harpon had worked since 2003.\n\n\u201cIt will determine, on the one hand, if detection and alert tools were in place at DRPP and whether they worked,\u201d he told Le Journal du Dimanche. Its findings are due by the end of the month.\n\nA second probe, completed by the end of the year, will sift through all of France\u2019s anti-terror intelligence services for such \u201cinternal threats\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe sieve will be very fine,\u201d said Mr Philippe.\n\nHarpon had worked in a section of the police service dedicated to collecting information on jihadist radicalisation Credit: AFP/Getty Images More\n\nIn June, a parliamentary report on radicalisation within the public services spoke of 30 suspected cases out of the 150,000 police officers and 130,000 gendarmes in France.\n\nThe revelations of Harpon\u2019s radicalism sparked opposition calls for the resignation of the interior minister. Mr Castaner was due to address these in an evening TV interview on Sunday, but earlier ruled out resigning while admitting that there were \u201cobviously security failures\u201d. He is to be grilled next week by France\u2019s parliamentary intelligence committee.\n\nHarpon converted to Islam about 10 years ago, the prosecutor said. He had no police record but was investigated for domestic violence in 2009.\n\nOn the morning of his \"extremely violent\" attack, he bought two knives - a 33-centimetre long kitchen knife and an oyster knife - which he kept hidden, Mr Ricard said.\n\nHe showed \"absolutely no signs of nervousness\" as he circled back to police headquarters, according to CCTV footage examined by police, the prosecutor said.\n\nThe attack, from his return to the office, the killings and his death by police bullets, lasted seven minutes.\n\nHe first killed a 50-year old police major and a 38-year old guard who worked in the same office as Harpon and were having lunch at their desks.", "description": "France is to probe \u201cinternal threats\u201d to all its intelligence services after prosecutors confirmed an IT worker with high-security clearance who killed four at Paris police headquarters had a \u201cradical vision of Islam\u201d.
