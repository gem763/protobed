One is pictured above in Wiltshire in 2016\n\nMr Taylor claimed he had wanted to hang the tributes from November 1 to November 10 and questioned why the lampposts needed to be \u2018stress tested\u2019 when the poppies weighed so little.\n\nDespite the refusal by the council, residents were seen hanging the plastic poppies on trees on October 26.\n\nThey were praised on Facebook with one user stating: \u2018Well done to all concerned, the Council need a lesson in humility and decency.\u2019\n\nThis is while Parish Councillor Neil Allsopp said it was a \u2018ludicrous decision\u2019.\n\n\u2018This is when we recognise the sacrifice men and women made for this country. I can\u2019t believe the mentality behind it.\n\n\u2018May they hang their heads in shame\u2019 he added.\n\nOne local woman said that to refuse permission was \u2018disgusting\u2019. Barbara Davenport also questioned how the poppies posed a health and safety risk.\n\nMailOnline contacted Tameside District Council.", "description": "Residents in Stalybridge, Manchester are furious with their local council after they were refused permission to fix the Remembrance Day poppies on lampposts.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/00/20261674-0-image-a-94_1572223252568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
