Or maybe you long for the day when you\u2019ve saved up enough money to quit a job you hate.\n\nSome of you might feel anxious because you\u2019re not prepared. Now, hear me out: It\u2019s never too late to start saving for retirement. And if you feel behind, don\u2019t panic! Getting ready for retirement will take planning and sacrifice, but you can do it.\n\nTo get you started, here are the two most important habits you can form as you plan for your dream retirement.\n\nDream in high definition\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, the first step is to schedule some time to dream. Yes, you heard me. I want you to daydream! And if you already have a vision for retirement, this is a great time to check in on those dreams.\n\nRetirement is about so much more than math\u2014it\u2019s about enjoying the things that make you come alive. Do you want to travel? Do you want to spend time with the love of your life, your children and grandchildren?\n\nOr do you finally want to start that nonprofit you\u2019ve had on your mind? Be specific!\n\nIn fact, I want you to know the exact dollar amount you\u2019ll need. I have a free tool on my website called the Retire Inspired Quotient (R:IQ) that will determine the amount of money you\u2019ll need for your dream retirement.\n\nMake a plan, and stick to it\n\nA dream without a plan is simply a wish. Your retirement depends 100 percent on what you do today. In my book Everyday Millionaires, we explore the research from the largest millionaire study ever conducted\u2014we interviewed over 10,000 of them!\n\nAnd we found that 79 percent of millionaires reached millionaire status by investing in their employer-sponsored retirement plans, building wealth over time.\n\nAnd we found that 79 percent of millionaires reached millionaire status by investing in their employer-sponsored retirement plans, building wealth over time.\n\nIf you want to be a millionaire by the time you retire, you have to maintain a millionaire mindset. Stay allergic to debt and live on less than you make.\n\nAlso, get help from a financial expert to simplify your investments and keep them on track. But remember: Never go on autopilot! Stay focused and engaged with the process.\n\nKeep in mind that your retirement is bigger than you. It\u2019s about the people you love and the purpose you have on this earth. It\u2019s about taking control of your future and leaving a legacy.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nI\u2019ll sum it up here in the wise words of Mama Hogan: \u201cIf it\u2019s meant to be, it\u2019s up to me.\u201d Remember, you can\u2019t delegate your dreams.
