These included a 32 percent payroll tax, a 25 percent surtax on income above the standard-deduction amount, a 42 percent value-added tax, mandatory premiums averaging $7,500 per capita, and more than doubling all individual and corporate tax rates.\n\nThe group estimated that Medicare for All could not be fully financed just by raising taxes on the wealthy.\n\nCRFB also estimated that Medicare for All could be financed by cutting all nonhealth spending by 80 percent, or by more than doubling the national debt, so that it increased to 205 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nThe group said that the financing options it listed could be combined, or that policymakers could reduce the cost of Medicare for All by making it less generous.\n\n\"Adopting smaller versions of several policies may prove more viable than adopting any one policy in full,\" CRFB wrote.\n\nCRFB said that most of the financing options it listed would on average be more progressive than current law, but most of the financing options would also shrink the economy.", "description": "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) on Monday\u00a0released a paper\u00a0providing its preliminary estimates for various ways to finance", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/doctor_patient.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
