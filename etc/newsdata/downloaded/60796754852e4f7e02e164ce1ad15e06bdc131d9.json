When I looked at it properly up close, I thought it looked like Jesus.\n\n\"I then saw a turban on the top, and realised who was staring up at me in the palm of my hand - Osama bin Laden.\"\n\nShe added: \"Funny that - as he was buried at sea too.\"\n\n(Image: Abdul Rehman / SWNS)\n\nAlthough most people believed the seashell resembled terrorist Bin Laden, others thought it looked like ex-Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nOsama bin Laden was the founder of the militant Islamist organisation al-Qaeda and mastermind of numerous terrorist attacks, including the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City.\n\nHe was killed in Pakistan on May 2, 2011.", "description": "Debra Oliver made the discovery while on a walk at Winchelsea Beach, East Sussex, with her husband Martin", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Natalie Oliver", "Swns", "Abdul Rehman"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542941.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_OSAMA_SHELL_01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
