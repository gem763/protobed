Hopefully it's a good lesson for other people as well,\" added Marsh, whose blunder could open the door for Marcus Stoinis in Brisbane.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's a game of cricket. Sometimes you get beaten, sometimes you get out, and you can't be punching walls.\"", "description": "All-rounder Mitchell Marsh is set to miss the opening Test against Pakistan after fracturing his right hand punching a wall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1605/1578c9957b004c5084515c536c82354f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
