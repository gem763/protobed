Honestly, we didn\u2019t exactly know what was wrong until now. Last week, I was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer that was caused by an abnormal pregnancy.\u201d\n\nSTRESSED-OUT PREGNANT WOMEN MAY BE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A BABY OF A CERTAIN SEX, STUDY FINDS\n\nA molar pregnancy is an abnormality of the placenta and is caused by an issue during fertilization, according to the American Pregnancy Association. It\u2019s also called gestational trophoblastic disease and occurs in about 1 out of every 1,000 pregnancies. The condition causes abnormal tissue to grow within the uterus and may cause malignant growths that require chemotherapy, as is the case for Velez.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely complicated so I\u2019ll try to make it as easy to understand as possible,\u201d Velez wrote to her followers. \u201cBefore I do \u2013 I want you to know that my kind of cancer is treatable. We have every reason to believe I will recover free and clear \u2013 just getting to that point is going to be tough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I had is called a molar pregnancy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a pregnancy that is not viable \u2013 meaning a fetus never formed \u2013 but instead of miscarrying, the pregnancy continued to grow and produced invasive placental tissue. Since the placenta is still there, the body mimics a pregnancy and spikes the pregnancy hormone (hCG) to astronomical levels. Essentially it was as if I was pregnant with 5 babies at once.\u201d\n\nVelez said the spike had made her extremely sick and caused heavy bleeding.\n\nBABY BORN WITH AMNIOTIC SAC STILL INTACT, PHOTOS SHOW\n\n\u201cNormally this can be treated with a surgical procedure to clear the tissue and then we just monitor the hCG levels until they reach zero. However\u2026 In some very rare cases that tissue can turn into cancer\u2026 and spread to other organs in the body,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is what happened to me. No good reason, just unfortunate dumb luck.\u201d\n\nVelez said that she has already started chemotherapy, and that she will likely lose her hair but that she already made it through two treatments. She said the plan is to continue receiving treatments until her body\u2019s hCG levels return to zero.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really put it into words what it is like to find out you have cancer\u2026 devastating\u2026 shocking and terrifying for starters \u2014 but there\u2019s so much more to this I never understood,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI plan to be as open and transparent about this journey as I can because it\u2019s the only way I know how to be.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOver the weekend, Velez shared a video from her hospital bed and explained that she needed a blood transfusion because her hemoglobin count was down and that she needed it to rise to continue with treatment. She said that while she hasn\u2019t had a chance to respond to every comment she has received, she is taking the time to read them, and appreciates the support.", "description": "Velez said she plans to be \"as transparent about this journey\" as she can be.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Michelle-Velez.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
