A bloody tissue is also stuck onto the back of the seat\n\n'I figure a diabetic would have a proper kit and wouldn't be carrying their s**** around in a newspaper, and I don't think it'd be easy/comfortable to light up some H and then get high on a public train,' one person said.\n\n'How about ice?' another person said.\n\n'Why would a steroid user inject on a train?' one person asked.\n\n'They would use a bigger gauge needle which would also be longer because they inject into muscle rather than into a vein or subcutaneously.'\n\nAnother said it could have been used for ice because of the size of the syringe\n\nThe poster said City Rail staff were quick to respond and thoroughly cleaned the seat.\n\n'You can't tell from the crappy photo, but the blood-spattered tissue had actually stuck to seat back,' the original poster said.\n\n'When the staff member came on board to clean it wasn't just a lift-it-bin-it exercise.\n\n'They dutifully cleaned and disinfected the seat as well with some outrageously-potent-smelling spray.'\n\nSydney Metro has been contacted for comment.", "description": "The image shows a used syringe, an alcohol disinfectant wipe used to clean the area of injection and a crumpled piece of paper.
