Shares of Uber, Lyft, and Peloton are trading below the prices of their initial public offerings. WeWork and Endeavor have postponed plans to go public.\n\nOf course, venture capital investors who bet early on these companies have made many times their initial investments. But later private investors haven\u2019t fared so well, and those who bought shares after the IPO have done worse. The cold response of the public market to what had been lauded as success stories raises questions about the health of both markets and the viability of many companies that survive the arduous culling from startups to public companies.\n\nThose questions should be asked, not just now but always. Is the market at peak and about to fall? Are Silicon Valley venture investors overestimating the value of their companies? If so, are both private and public markets out of whack because years of cheap capital allowed venture funds to slide into carelessness? The recent high-profile flops would seem a cautionary tale, but there are also reasons not to take these stories as a leading indicator.\n\nOf those stories, Uber and WeWork stand out. After a delay that saw its founder Travis Kalanick removed and a new management attempt to instill more professionalism, Uber did eventually go public in May, at a less than expected valuation. But the process was bruising, as institutional investors questioned the company\u2019s viability, which received even more scrutiny when the company announced a $5 billion second-quarter loss in August, much of that due to charges for employee stock compensation. Its shares have bounced around but are now more than 35 percent below the offering price.\n\nCompared with WeWork, however, Uber looks like a success. Like Uber, WeWork had a charismatic founder, Adam Neumann, who imbibed the Silicon Valley Kool-Aid of move fast and break things. Neumann presented WeWork as a disruptor par excellence, branding his office-sharing company a technology platform rather than a real estate company, just as Kalanick characterized Uber as a technology platform and not a ride sharing company. Like Kalanick, Neumann was forced out, but only after it became apparent that the company\u2019s private market valuation of nearly $50 billion was a mirage bolstered by an astonishingly misguided $10 billion investment by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son and Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund. The fund, with more than $100 billion in assets, bolstered by Son\u2019s early stake in Alibaba and a considerable chunk from the Saudis, has more than enough cash to withstand the loss, which may explain why Son was willing to take such a gamble.\n\nFollowing the sudden collapse of WeWork\u2019s IPO plans, Peloton\u2014an innovator in personal fitness that is bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars and does not see profitability for at least three years\u2014went public and promptly sank, while the Endeavor Group, which has been attempting to rebrand itself as a multiplatform media company, took the temperature of the markets and decided it was best to shelve its own IPO plans, long in the making. And then there is Palantir, which barreled into data mining and built a significant business in both the private and government sectors but whose attempts to justify a $25 billion or more valuation in public markets have not borne fruit.\n\nThis string of high-profile stumbles has raised questions about the health of the broader market, and the economy\u2014and given rise to clashing theories of impending doom. Some say the ability of money-losing companies to go public is a sign that the market is about to peak, on the theory that venture capital investors are trying to get what they can while they can. Others say the weak performance of these supposed giants is a sign that the market is about to crash, on the theory that if even the smart money can\u2019t make money, then it\u2019s clearly the end of the line. Both theories reach the same conclusion; like most theories about the market, neither has a great track record of predicting anything.", "description": "Opinion: Venture capitalists can be subject to the same bubbles and group think as ordinary investors.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Zachary Karabel", "Lauren Goode", "Christopher Ryan", "Emma Grey Ellis", "Rhett Allain", "Joan Westenberg", "Arielle Pardes", "Will Knight", "Paris Martineau"], "top_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/5d94ed24fa59c50009c4a0a8/master/w_2560,c_limit/Biz_IPOs_RTX6V7HS.jpg"}
