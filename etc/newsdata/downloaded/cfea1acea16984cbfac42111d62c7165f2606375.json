Every asset class faces risks \u2013 even cash is exposed to inflation and debasing. Expose your portfolio to shares \u2013 companies will continue to operate and earn profits, and by owning lots of quality companies across a range of industries you will spread your risk.\n\nLook at property \u2013 we can\u2019t build more land, and it has the additional benefit of commanding a rental income stream. Don\u2019t forget bonds \u2013 they are less volatile than shares and property, and they provide a highly predictable income stream. Additionally, bonds issued by credible governments and corporates tend to rise in value in times of crisis, when shares and property are falling in value. This inverse correlation can be hugely helpful in limiting your portfolio's downside in times of crisis.\n\nFinally, hold some cash (but not too much). Cash doesn't earn much, and comes with its own risks (fiat currency), but is still helpful in the portfolio context. Cash provides liquidity and flexibility. It is a pot of reserves that can fund expenses (and SMSF pension payments) for a period, and may also facilitate the topping up of cheap assets in times of dislocation.\n\nStanding still might no longer be the best option.\n\nIf you are feeling paralysed, and genuinely feel that a 100 per cent cash exposure for your SMSF is the best option, remember there is also a considerable opportunity cost of not being invested. The longer the predicted calamity takes to occur, the more costly the \"safe\" strategy becomes. If we assume a long-term rate of return of 7.5 per cent on, say, a balanced portfolio, and a worst-case return on a balanced portfolio of -15 per cent, the strategy is destined to fail if the predicted calamity takes more than two years to transpire. Mathematically this is a poor gamble.\n\nWhile term deposits have been a staple ingredient for most SMSFs, we are in uncharted territory in terms of returns. Your particular cash-flow requirements and personal circumstances should dictate your next move but standing still might no longer be the best option.\n\nBen Smythe is a partner and principal adviser of Minchin Moore Private Wealth.", "description": "With interest rates falling, standing still with cash could be just as risky as exposure to growth assets if the markets turn down.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d7d5bf0d88ee2de7823bd3c19a477f5805e0033e", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
