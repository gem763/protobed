I know it\u2019s been a while since the latter happened, but I\u2019m happy to come in and explain how it\u2019s done.\"\n\nOn Tuesday MP's backed the PM's Withdrawal Agreement Bill by 329 votes to 299 - setting up a clash on the amount of time MPs have to scrutinise it.\n\nIt is a significant threshold for Mr Johnson's deal - indicating that enough MPs are willing to support it in certain circumstances but it does not mean the legislation has passed.\n\nMPs were set to table amendments to the bill.\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nBut the Prime Minister \"paused\" his Brexit deal after the House of Commons refused to accept a bid to rush it through in three days.\n\nHumbled by MPs, the Tory chief finally dropped his hardline pledge to leave on October 31 - and accepted it is now up to EU leaders to decide whether to delay.", "description": "The now editor of the London Evening Standard hit back after CCHQ criticised his paper's coverage of the Brexit bill", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Bloomberg Via Getty Images", "Dan Kitwood"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715968.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EveningStandardEditor-George-Osborne-Portraits.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
