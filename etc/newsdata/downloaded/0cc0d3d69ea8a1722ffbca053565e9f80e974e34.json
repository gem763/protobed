I'm telling you the truth and I'm telling you this, and I don't know what to do. You still don't trust me' he said.\n\nIsabella told Rolling Stone that she had been inspired by a toxic relationship with her ex, who she dated for six months a year ago.\n\n'He tended to get angry and lash out sometimes at people. It wasn't super often, but after a while he started to act that way towards me. If I were to not answer him for a long time or was doing something else he'd get irritated' she said.\n\nTenley Earles, 18, from Virginia, posted an interpretive dance of herself moving to a audio of her ex-boyfriend, a pastor's son, berating her for wearing leggings to school. Sporting a white polo neck and black trousers, Tenley, clearly carefree, gestures her arms up and down while moving to her ex-boyfriend shouting down the phone\n\nShe broke up with him after he admitted to cheating on her, which led him to leave the grovelling voicemail Isabella dances to in the clip.\n\n'It had really bothered me [to hear the message] at the time, but at this point it was just funny' she added.\n\nThe video has since received more than 388,000 likes, and her follower count has jumped from 10,000 to 30,000.\n\nAnd it's spawned a wave of copycat videos, including one by Tenley Earles, 18, from Virginia, who posted an interpretive dance set to an audio of her ex-boyfriend, a pastor's son, berating her for wearing leggings to school.\n\nTenley was inspired by a viral post by Isabella (pictured), also 18, believed to be from the US. She said she found the clip 'hilarious' and 'really empowering'. In the clip, Isabella, wearing an oversized army print hoody dances to her ex, who sobs down the phone, apologising for cheating on her\n\nSporting a white polo neck and black trousers, a carefree Tenley waved her arms up and down while moving to her ex-boyfriend shouting down the phone.\n\n'Whenever the f*** you want to wear it and act like that s***'s not disrespectful at all,' he told her.\n\n'I'm not dating someone who's got every f****** dude at the school looking at her.\n\n'You wanna do that, don't f****** be with me' he shouts down the phone.\n\nShe later added more videos, warning other teens to look out for warning signs of abusive behaviour, explaining that she needed to get a restraining order against her ex.\n\n'S/O the the WORST and most manipulative relationship I've been in' she wrote. In the five days since she's posted the video, it's racked up 697.7k likes and 4.3k comments, and inspired dozens more girls to do the same.\n\nSpeaking to Rolling Stone, Tenley said: 'It was really hard listening to it the first few times, even now. [But this time] I was able to laugh at myself and at him.'\n\nAnother clip shows a girl using Siri to play out her boyfriend's text messages. As she dances, they say 'I'm truly sorry, I'm done with the bulls***;\n\nOnce the videos were also shared on Twitter, the girls have won praise from dozens of people.\n\n'The Tik Tok genre of teen girls doing interpretive dances to voicemails left by their abusive ex-boyfriends was a lot to discover this morning' one wrote, adding: 'Your sons are truly out of their f**king minds but your daughters are honestly funny as hell'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Tik Tok girls inspire me'\n\nA third said: 'Tik Tok: come for teens reaching you innovative ways to steal things, stay for teens teaching you how to better identify abusive relationships'.\n\nA fourth commented: 'I'm no being sarcastic, we better see this", "description": "The craze is believed to have been started by an American teenager called Isabella, 18, who shared a video of herself dancing to a grovelling apology from her cheating ex, begging her to trust him.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/12/20032310-0-image-a-20_1571743919562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
