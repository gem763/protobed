A youth product of hometown club Coventry City, he spent four formative months on loan at Kettering Town, then of the Conference. \u201cYou could smell burgers and chips when you\u2019re running up and down the line, 1,000 in non-League watching,\u201d he remembers.\n\n\u201cFor me it was about getting experienced and getting minutes under my belt. It toughened me up, playing men\u2019s football, getting a bollocking off the managers. When I was in the Conference you have people\u2019s livelihoods depending on results. Win bonuses to them make such a difference, so if you\u2019re making as mistake you\u2019re getting told about it.\u201d\n\nBut even then, as a teenager learning his game in a dressing room of grizzled professionals, he quietly believed that he would eventually represent his country. \u201cI said I will play for England one day,\u201d he insists. \u201cI never actually told any of the players. It\u2019s a bit disrespectful when a lot of them players were a bit older and never got that opportunity.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cThey would think: \u2018Young little whippersnapper coming in, saying he\u2019s going to play for England, get out of here\u2019. For me, I basically told family, friends. They all said yes, go for it. Some games you would be playing terrible and I\u2019d think: \u2018No, it\u2019s never going to happen\u2019. But you have to keep that belief there, and here I am.\u201d\n\nIt was this self-confidence which allowed Wilson to rise up the divisions, transitioning between them with ease, until the present day, St George\u2019s Park and a fourth successive England call-up. \u201cThat was always the aim, to play for the national team, to play in the Premier League,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I got there, I felt I had been there before because in my head I had been there.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He wants to establish himself as a regular in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squads and perhaps even a regular in his starting line-ups. One thing is for certain: the Bournemouth striker will need conviction in his own abilities and more of the same self-belief in order to dislodge Harry Kane.\n\nWilson, Kane and Chelsea youngster Tammy Abraham are all taking part in this England camp. They are all more traditional centre-forwards than the likes of Raheem Sterling, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford. While Southgate reserves two places in his starting line-up for those \u2018wide forwards\u2019, he tends to play with just one central striker.\n\nIt is currently Kane\u2019s place to lose, but Wilson has matched his Tottenham counterpart for goals in the opening weeks of the new Premier League season, with five in eight games. \u201cThose performances speak for themselves,\u201d he says of his club form. \u201cThey will get you into the squad, that\u2019s all I can do to get here. When I get here, train well, wait for my opportunity, be patient.\n\n\u201cHarry is a great player. I\u2019m not saying I want to kick him out of the team, but with injuries, things that happen along the way, you have to be ready to grasp the opportunity. Whether it is one minute, 20 minutes, the opening whistle. It\u2019s not just thinking \u2018Harry is going to play\u2019. Anything could happen and I have to be ready to come on and make a difference. I am fully focused.\u201d\n\nBut Wilson is also aware that if he and Kane are Southgate\u2019s strikers next summer, he will most likely be the understudy. That gives him an opportunity to observe and take inspiration, something he has already done during their camps together. \u201cIn training you watch how clinical he is, in the finishing sessions, training with him, doing those sessions. There is no laughing and joking, just pure concentration,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSometimes in club football, you\u2019ll be doing a finishing session but having a bit of banter with the lads, a competition, laughing and joking, people missing, but in a game that is not what happens, you have to be focused. Harry is in that frame of mind, and I have taken that into my own training back at Bournemouth.\n\n\u201cI like to think I can make an impact,\u201d he adds, accepting the likelihood that his role, for now, is one from the bench. \u201cIn cup games, I tend to come on for Bournemouth as a sub, and you get quite a few goals from that.\u201d And given his journey from the smell of burgers and chips in Kettering to a possible international tournament this summer, Wilson knows one thing well. \u201cThings change in football so quick that you have to be ready to take an opportunity when it comes.\u201d", "description": "Callum Wilson was once a long way from becoming an England\u00a0international.
