It is understood Equalities Minister Liz Truss is understood to want to consider the next steps carefully before taking any action - almost a year after a consultation closed.\n\nA source close to the Cabinet minister said earlier this month she was \"committed to following through with the consultation in due course\".", "description": "The PM - who once branded gay men 'tank-topped bumboys' - also vowed to make children feel safe at school following anti-LGBT protests in a video address to the PinkNews awards", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pool Afp Via Getty Images", "Barcroft Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580102.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT-HEALTH.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
