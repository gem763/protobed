The comment was apparently made in jest but he joins a long line of prominent Americans to float the idea of emigrating to New Zealand as a way to escape Trump\u2019s chaotic presidency.\n\nRyan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) Former FBI Director James Comey says he's moving to New Zealand if President Donald Trump wins re-election pic.twitter.com/fBMPaJHEPI\n\nRelocating to the nation has become something of an obsession for Silicon Valley billionaires and preppers who fear the apocalypse is looming. Immigration to the country hit a record high in mid-2017 with many seeing the politically stable country as a refuge from the likes of Brexit and a divided America.\n\nWhy Silicon Valley billionaires are prepping for the apocalypse in New Zealand \u2013 podcast Read more\n\nIn 2016 the supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the New York Times \u201cNow it\u2019s time for us to move to New Zealand\u201d if Trump was elected. One week after Trump\u2019s inauguration the New Yorker ran a piece that referred to New Zealand as a \u201cfavoured refuge in the event of a cataclysm\u201d for the super-rich.\n\nAfter the Trump election and Brexit referendum the Immigration New Zealand website experienced unprecedented traffic. Typically the site receives 3,000 registrations a month from British nationals interested in moving to, working or investing in New Zealand. On the day of the Brexit referendum the website received 998 registrations from Britons, compared with 109 at the same time the year before.\n\nHigh-profile Americans who have bought property and sometimes live in New Zealand include the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and the disgraced NBC host Matt Lauer.\n\nProfessor John Morgan, a British expat and academic at the University of Auckland, said there was an ingrained idea in the northern hemisphere that New Zealand was an undisturbed haven from the modern world. \u201cThere is this pervading idea that New Zealand is some sort of relic of 1950s Britain, a place to escape, a place to go back in time. That is not true, but it is generally true that New Zealand does avoid the worst trappings of modern, consumerist culture. There is a rush hour \u2013 but it is just an hour.\u201d", "description": "Former FBI boss joins long list of Americans who look to Aotearoa as a refuge", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb05dde012898b824ec5b5750a64097faedbe59e/0_151_3582_2148/master/3582.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc8a0133be7b868d3c4661c68dc5e4e7", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
