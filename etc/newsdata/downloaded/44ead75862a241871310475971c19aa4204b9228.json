The peak ahead is an October 31 Brexit that he has promised to deliver \"come what may\", \"do or die\", and \"no ifs or buts\".\n\nBut as of Friday, the summit was still shrouded in impenetrable fog. Or, to use his other metaphor, the Shawshank sewer still looks awfully murky.\n\nA special parliamentary session on Saturday - the first weekend sitting since the 1982 Falklands War - is supposed to ratify the deal.\n\nWill there be Brexit deliverance this weekend?\n\nWhips and pundits are crunching the numbers, and the only thing they agree on is that it's going to be incredibly tight. Nobody knows if Johnson has any justification at all for his statement on Friday (AEDT) that he's \"very confident\" the House of Commons will pass the deal that day.\n\nHis biggest problem is that he's lost the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - a diehard clutch of ardent Protestant UK patriots, and pretty much the only significant Northern Irish grouping that favours Brexit.\n\nThe numbers game\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe DUP boasts only 10 MPs, but every vote counts in a parliament on a knife-edge. The arithmetic is like this. Johnson needs 320 votes for a majority (there are 650 MPs, but Sinn Fein's seven MPs don't take their seats and the Speaker and his two deputies don't vote).\n\nHe has 285 of his own. There are 21 excommunicated Tory rebels, who \"lost the whip\" for voting against his government. There are about nine Labour rebels who have been consistently prepared to vote for a Tory deal.\n\nIt's optimistic to think that every single \"Spartan\" Brexiteer (they number about 30) and every \"rebel alliance\" ex-Tory will vote for Johnson's deal. But even if they do, without the DUP he's still roughly half a dozen votes short. How can he fatten his column?\n\nSo far, Johnson has lost every single parliamentary vote as Prime Minister bar one. So if he prevails on Saturday, he will be hailed a Brexit saviour and political genius.\n\nThat's not a crown the opposition parties will willingly put on his head. But his trump card is that from their perspective, there is something even worse than handing him victory: being the agents of an economically damaging no-deal Brexit.\n\nThat's why Johnson wants to frame the vote as a choice between his deal and no deal. He was hoping the Europeans would back him up on this at their summit, but they weren't prepared to - all they'd say was, in effect, \"let's see what happens and then we'll decide what to do\".\n\nBut it's hard to take Johnson's no-deal threat seriously. That's because a \"rebel alliance\" of opposition parties and the 21 anti-Brexit Tories last month passed a law saying that if Johnson's deal couldn't pass the House of Commons by October 19, he'd have to ask for a three-month delay to his \"do or die\" Halloween Brexit.\n\nSo his second line of attack is that if parliament knocks back the deal, he'll delay Brexit and call an election in which he has a viable Brexit plan and all the opposition parties have is promises of a second referendum, more infighting, more negotiation, more interminable delay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson is riding high in the polls: a YouGov survey this week had the Tories on 37 per cent, 15 points clear of the Labour Party. This is an election the opposition parties, with the exception of the Scottish National Party, should rightly fear.\n\nBut they may be able to prevent him calling an election, as they have before. Lacking a coherent collective strategy, they may simply play for time, demanding he seek the Brexit delay simply to allow parliament to keep going around in circles.\n\nJohnson could end up, by the narrowest of margins, as a reincarnation of May: returning triumphant from Brussels with a piece of paper in his hand, peace in our time, only to have MPs throw it into his weary face.\n\nBut Johnson's deal isn't May's deal. And there has definitely been a change in the dynamic since May's sorry run of 'meaningful vote' defeats. For one thing, Johnson has won back the platoon of Brexiteers who made May's life a misery.\n\nThe blockers\n\nBut some things haven't changed, particularly on Labour's frontbench. The Opposition Labour (245 MPs) doesn't like Johnson's withdrawal agreement because it's a Tory deal, and their mission is, and always has been, to continue resisting every Conservative Brexit initiative until the party wilts, and flops out of power in favour of the Jeremy Corbyn alternative.\n\nThe strategy isn't working. Corbyn is more unpopular than ever. The move to oppose any particular Brexit (to please Remain voters) while still promising to deliver Brexit (to please Leave voters) has alienated, rather than attracted, both sides. Not many people, even in the party's caucus and membership, are happy sitting on the fence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo they now want to push for a referendum on a deal, though it's unclear if they will do that on Saturday. And it's unclear if they want a referendum on Johnson's deal, or whether they instead want a referendum after an election, when they've had a chance (assuming they win office) to negotiate their own deal. With all those options, the easiest choice is simple, blanket negativity.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats (19 MPs) oppose Brexit. They want an election, because they fancy their chances of picking off Labour and Tory MPs in heavily Remain-voting areas. The Scottish National Party (35 MPs) are in the same boat, seeing the chaos as a chance to gain seats and press for a second independence referendum.\n\nUncomfortable position: Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn is trying to straddle both sides of Brexit. Getty\n\nThey would argue, plausibly, that Johnson's deal is economically more damaging than May's deal in the short and medium term, and worse than any 'soft Brexit' outcome. They'd also argue that last time around, voters had to choose between a fantasy Brexit and the status quo; now, they'd get to make a more informed choice, with the realities of Brexit laid before them.\n\nJohnson reckons his argument - that the people have had their say in 2016, and now want to see Brexit delivered - is simpler, and more potent. The Liberal Democrats may well find out that he's right on this.\n\nThe DUP have come a long way. Once upon a time, the idea of a customs border in the Irish Sea (separating Northern Ireland from Great Britain) instead of along the land frontier with Ireland, was \"a blood-red line\". They've now swallowed that.\n\nTheir chief objection is now that Northern Ireland has to follow EU rules - despite being formally still part of Britain's customs territory - but the unionist community has no way of opting out, or influencing those rules.\n\nUnder Johnson's original plan, the DUP could exercise a veto over EU alignment that the deal proposed. Now, the veto has to be exercised across the sectarian divide - and since the nationalists and unionists never agree on anything, and the regional assembly is in the deep freeze, that arrangement would favour the veto never being exercised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe DUP are the toughest nut to crack. The usual trick, of showering the province with millions, even billions, of public money, probably won't work this time.\n\nThey have only two vulnerabilities: they are defending a few marginal seats in the province, and being seen to block a deal may do them no favours; and they don't want a no-deal Brexit, because it will be an economic disaster that will also come back to bite them.\n\nThe end game\n\nDislike it as they do, this deal might be the best the DUP will ever get. Johnson just has to offer them a way to save face, but they will hold out until the bitter end.\n\nAt the moment, the bookies are offering identical odds for MPs backing the deal, and MPs rejecting it. Nobody has any idea.\n\nThe debate will be emotional and febrile - tempers will be lost, nerves will fray. Just looking at the hard numbers on the floor of parliament and the pronouncements of party leaders, it's marginally more likely he'll narrowly lose.\n\nWhat then? All Johnson will say is that he'll still deliver Brexit on October 31. But it's hard to see how. Will he break the law, plunging Britain into a new constitutional crisis? Will he ask for the Brexit delay - and if he does, will he get the election that he sees as the way out of the deadlock?\n\nBritain does feel a step closer to emerging from the Shawshank tunnel. But there's still a thick pool of effluent to wade through yet. Johnson, though, is an eternal optimist: like Robbins, he wants to \"crawl though a river of shit and come out clean on the other side\".\n\nStill, as one character says in The Shawshank Redemption: \"Hope is a dangerous thing, my friend. It can kill a man.\"", "description": "Having landed a deal, Boris Johnson has just done what, incredibly, was probably the easy part.
