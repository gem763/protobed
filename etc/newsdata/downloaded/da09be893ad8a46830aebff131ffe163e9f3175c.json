I point it out now to the driver, and he offers a wry smile as he takes me to the place where, for the next four days, I\u2019m to be immersed in an intensive period of \u201cme time\u201d. I\u2019ve never done this before, so have no idea what to expect.\n\nLong-term health conditions can be interesting in all sorts of unexpected ways. You learn about your levels of resilience, and the efforts you are prepared to take to get better. I\u2019ve been struggling with low physical energy for almost a decade, my mitochondrial cells malfunctioning after successive flu viruses never quite left my body. Doctors didn\u2019t know what to recommend \u2013 these cells aren\u2019t easily \u201cfixed\u201d \u2013 and so suggested what they suggest to anyone who presents mysteriously: eat better, sleep well. Do yoga, learn to meditate.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Retreat sessions include yoga, nostril breathing and meditation\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last five years dipping in and out of meditation \u2013 apps, YouTube, Ruby Wax\u2019s focus on mindfulness through books and interviews \u2013 but it was vedic meditation (a close cousin of transcendental, which uses a silent mantra or sound repeated over and over) I kept returning to. I liked it but always let it slip. I knew that to establish a habit I would need to immerse myself, under in-person instruction.\n\nAnd so here I am, near Arundel in West Sussex, at a large, rambling country house with lush gardens, on a weekend vedic retreat run by Beeja. Its strapline suggests: Meditation for Everyone and its founder, Will Williams, has been teaching vedic meditation for more than five years. After a stint in the music business, and falling ill, he recovered through meditation \u2013 and began to teach what he had learned. He runs introductory courses in London. Will is a convincing communicator: Hoxton-bearded and smiley, dressed not in robes but in Edwin jeans, conspicuously one of us.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Beeja Meditation retreat near Arundel\n\nThere are 15 in attendance, eight women, seven men, ranging from 24 to 70. We\u2019re a cosmopolitan bunch: there\u2019s a Saudi, a Lebanese, one from Guadalupe, another from South Korea. Two from Essex. Some, like me, have medical issues, others are struggling with anxiety, depression and such pronounced social media addiction that handing over phones upon arrival proves problematic. I\u2019m to share a dorm for four but \u2013 mercifully \u2013 there\u2019s just two of us this weekend.\n\nAfter an introductory dinner of nut loaf, Will\u2019s co-instructor, Niamh Keane, reminds us of the house rules: up at 6.45am, in bed by 10.30pm; respect one another\u2019s confidentiality. No sex and no \u201csolo sex\u201d, as Niamh puts it, just unbroken serenity and purity of mind. We\u2019re detoxing, so can have neither caffeine nor alcohol. No breakfast either, a fact that horrifies us all initially but becomes curiously unimportant by day two.\n\nOn a meditation retreat I find you meditate, and do precious little else. Beeja\u2019s version comprises a succession of \u201crounding\u201d exercises: 15 minutes of yoga, five minutes of alternate nostril breathing, 20 of meditation, and 10 of the flat-on-your-back yoga pose, shavasana. We\u2019re all given an individual secret mantra to repeat silently (though who\u2019s to say we don\u2019t have the same one?!). For three days.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Beeja Meditation retreat guest tries nostril breathing\n\nAt first, most of us choose to do our exercises communally, in the living room, but increasingly we drift off in pursuit of solitude. I thought I\u2019d struggle, because meditating at home is difficult, but here, with no distractions, I slide into it as if it were a hot bath. Hours pass, then hours more.\n\nRespite comes in the evenings, after simple vegetarian food (rice and dhal, Thai soup), when Will sits, Buddha-like, with us at his feet while he shares his vedic-derived wisdom. He\u2019s a practitioner of many years and is so convinced of his discipline\u2019s ability to heal the world that he can tend towards the over-prescriptive. He condemns most diets in favour of an ayurvedic-approved one, and proffers opinion on antidepressants, climate change, and Trump voters. He tells us that the introduction of 5G will kill off the insect world, that we should never cross our legs, and how we must avoid eating onions because the skin contains properties that promote selfishness. Much of what he says is fascinating, plenty else sails far above our heads.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vegetarian food is served during the four-day retreat\n\nHe asks how our sessions are going and when I tell him that during one of mine my hands began to levitate and my fingers grew like intertwining tree branches, as if I were morphing into a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale, he beams with pleasure and says: \u201cYou\u2019ve shifted some serious energy there, fella.\u201d\n\nThe more we meditate, the more our protective bubble expands. When we come to leave, Niamh implores we take care upon re-entering the world outside, as we will be newly hypersensitive to light, noise, other people. \u201cBe gentle with yourselves,\u201d she advises.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The retreat\u2019s pool\n\nThe trip back home is complicated by the usual travel chaos \u2013 delays, overcrowding \u2013 but we endure it without any obvious adverse effect on our hitherto delicate dispositions. But then meditation affects different people differently and any long-term benefits may only announce themselves over time. What I know right now is that I\u2019ve never had a weekend quite like it, never been so still, or rested, never spent so much time with myself, or by myself.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite bliss, but I did attain something conspicuously rare in a life otherwise filled with such perpetual distraction: peace.\n\n\u2022 Four-day, three-night weekend retreats cost from \u00a3594 for a twin room, \u00a3534 for a dorm room, and include food, drink and instruction; six-monthly payment options available, beejameditation.com\n\nNick Duerden\u2019s memoir, Get Well Soon: Adventures in Alternative Healthcare, is out now (Bloomsbury, \u00a312.99).
