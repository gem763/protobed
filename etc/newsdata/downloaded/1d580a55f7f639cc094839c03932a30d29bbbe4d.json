They apologised profusely for waking me up.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t help noticing they were staring at me. Perhaps they were starstruck, I thought, as I headed back to bed.\n\n\"Stopping off in the bathroom, I realised that the workmen weren\u2019t bedazzled by the sight of the legendary Elton John. They were bedazzled by the sight of the legendary Elton John with his wig on back to front.\"\n\nMe: Elton John Official Autobiography by Elton John is published by Macmillan on October 15th, \u00a325", "description": "Elton has lifted the lid on his failed attempts to stop himself from balding and the self-consciousness that forced him to put his wig on to greet intruders", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Michael Ochs Archives", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19023185.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Elton-John.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
