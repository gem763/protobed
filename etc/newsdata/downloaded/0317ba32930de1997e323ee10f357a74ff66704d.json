To secure the funds from the National Institutes of Health, the associate professor at Stony Brook\u2019s School of Medicine submitted fake invoices for research equipment from sham companies, according to prosecutors.\n\n\u201cProfessor Girnun\u2019s alleged theft of federal and state grant funds earmarked for cancer research can be explained in two words: pure greed,\u201d United States Attorney Richard Donoghue said in a press release announcing the charges.\n\nGirnun pleaded not guilty Thursday afternoon in Long Island federal court and was was released on a $250,000 bond. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors allege Girnun created two shell companies, Atlas Metabolomics and Empyrean Biosciences, in 2013 and claimed they were providing research materials and equipment for his cancer-related research projects.\n\n\u201cGirnun then submitted fraudulent electronic invoices to SBU for payment to the companies for equipment, goods and services that were never received or provided,\u201d the indictment filed in the U.S. Eastern District of New York states.\n\nThe school used more than $200,000 of internal grant funds and money it had received from the National Institutes of Health to pay his shell companies between 2013 and 2017, the indictment alleges.\n\nOnce the school made the payments, prosecutors allege, Girnun allegedly transferred the funds to his personal bank accounts to pay off several personal expenses. Some of those expenses included \u201cpayments toward the mortgage on his home,\u201d the indictment alleges.\n\n\u201cAs millions of Americans place their faith in programs established to fund cancer-related research, Geoffrey Girnun, a professor, allegedly siphoned money from grant funds established for this very purpose,\u201d William Sweeny, FBI assistant director-in-charge, said. \u201cWhile people continued to suffer from their illnesses, Girnun made payments toward his personal mortgage with the money he stole. His conduct is despicable, and it won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe National Institute of Health is the primary agency of the government \u201cresponsible for research grant funding and conducting biomedical and public research.\u201d According to the school, the medical institute \u201cconducts $90 million in funded research annually, with National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored research programs in neurological diseases, cancer\u201d and other topics.\n\nAccording to the university\u2019s website, Girnun started as an associate professor of pathology at Stony Brook in 2013 after working at the Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology at the University of Maryland. The 48-year-old\u2019s research focuses on the \u201cmetabolic control of hepatocellular carcinoma by PGC1 alpha, and he is also investigating PPAR gamma coactivation in obesity and colon cancer,\u201d according to the website.\n\nIn addition to his faculty position, Girnun served as the director of cancer metabolomics for the Cancer Center.\n\nFounded in 1957, Stony Brook University is one of only four campuses in the State University of New York (SUNY) system with more than 26,000 students and 2,600 faculty members. The school is among the top 62 research institutions in North America, and the Renaissance School of Medicine is the number one ranked public medical institute in New York state.\n\n\u201cThe University is outraged and appalled by the allegations that led to the arrest of Geoffrey Girnun today,\u201d a university spokesperson told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis alleged behavior is absolutely contrary to the ethical and professional standards expected of our faculty.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added Girnun has been placed on administrative leave.\n\nGirnun\u2019s lawyer did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s requests for comment.", "description": "The associate professor allegedly spent the stolen funds on personal expenses, including his mortgage payments.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_258/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568307511/GettyImages-1104049_rzkvhy"}
