REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe ongoing U.S.-China trade war loomed prominently in the U.S. central bank\u2019s latest Beige Book compendium of anecdotes from companies around the country, with several of its districts reporting the conflict was weighing on business.\n\nThe report, released ahead of the Fed\u2019s Sept. 17-18 policy meeting when central bankers are widely expected to cut interest rates to counter the economic slowdown, suggested that U.S. businesses do not expect a recession soon.\n\n\u201cAlthough concerns regarding tariffs and trade policy uncertainty continued, the majority of businesses remained optimistic about the near-term outlook,\u201d according to the Fed\u2019s report.\n\nThe central bank said growth in employment appeared to be \u201cmodest\u201d in recent weeks, a pace that was \u201con par with the previous reporting period.\u201d\n\nBut manufacturing activity was slightly weaker than during the previous period, the Fed said.\n\nThe report detailed a host of concerns by businesses about tariffs, including the prospect that uncertainty over the direction of trade policy could dampen investment.\n\nIn the Fed\u2019s Boston district, which includes much of New England, \u201ctariffs continued to be a minor but persistent pricing issue for manufacturers.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s trade conflicts are also compounding problems faced by farmers, the report said.\n\n\u201cAgricultural conditions remained weak as a result of unfavorable weather conditions, low commodity prices, and trade-related uncertainties,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s business contacts mostly reported ongoing growth in consumer spending, the main engine for U.S. economic growth, which has appeared strong in recent months despite the global slowdown.\n\nBut some parts of the country appeared to be less robust.\n\nIn the St. Louis district, which covers a swath of the Midwest and South, \u201creports from general retailers and auto dealers indicate consumer activity has been mixed since our previous report.\u201d The Minneapolis district reported that consumer spending was flat, while the Atlanta district noted that consumer loan growth declined.\n\nThe Beige Book was compiled by the Atlanta Fed from reports assembled from all 12 of the Fed\u2019s regional banks through Aug. 23.", "description": "The U.S. economy grew at a modest pace in recent weeks, with manufacturing buffeted by a global slowdown while consumer purchases gave mixed signals on the strength of household spending, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Jason Lange", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426249484&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831X9"}
