Both were released on bail.\n\nOutside the court, demonstrators queued to get in, some chanting slogans like \u201cWearing a face mask isn\u2019t a crime\u201d and \u201cThe law is unjust\u201d.\n\nMany said they feared the mask ban was just the first of more emergency orders to come.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an excuse to just introduce other totalitarian laws, next is martial law,\u201d one protester outside the court, who gave his surname Lo, told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Few concessions \u2013\n\nThe rallies were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions of criminal suspects to the mainland.\n\nThis fuelled fears of an erosion of liberties promised under the 50-year \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model China agreed to ahead of the 1997 handover by Britain.\n\nAfter Beijing and local leaders took a hard stance to the initial protests, the demonstrations snowballed into a wider movement calling for more democratic freedoms and police accountability.\n\nLam has refused major concessions, but struggled to come up with any political solution.\n\nThe past week has seen a particularly intense stretch of protests.\n\nThe worst clashes to date erupted on Tuesday as China celebrated 70 years of Communist Party rule, with a teenager shot and wounded by police as he attacked an officer.\n\nOver the weekend largely peaceful flash mob rallies and marches featured people wearing masks.\n\nBut more hardcore protesters also went on the rampage, trashing subway stations, ransacking government offices and vandalising businesses with mainland ties.\n\nLarge parts of the railway network closed over the weekend because of the vandalism, while many shops and malls closed. Some subways stations and shops remained closed on Monday, a public holiday in Hong Kong.\n\n\u2013 PLA warning \u2013\n\nSunday witnessed the largest protests, with police firing tear gas to disperse tens of thousands of people marching on the main island. Clashes broke out at multiple other locations throughout the day, with dozens injured.\n\nA warning flag was even raised on the roof of a People\u2019s Liberation Army barracks after protesters shone laser pens at the building, the first time Chinese troops in the city have made such a move.\n\nOn the mainland, Beijing flexed its muscles by pulling a top US basketball team\u2019s games from state broadcaster CCTV after its manager posted a tweet featuring the message \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nThe Houston Rockets tried to calm waters, issuing apologies from players and the manager.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s government may censor the internet in a bid to contain months of increasingly violent pro-democracy protests, a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/e2e342_hong-kong-has-left-reeling-weeknd-rallies-riots-hong-kong-cabinet-member-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
