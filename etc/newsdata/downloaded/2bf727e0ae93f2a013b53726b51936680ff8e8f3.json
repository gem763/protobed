Show Hide Dominic Cummings, the son of an oil rig project manager and a special needs teacher, was born in Durham in 1971. He attended a state primary school followed by the fee-paying Durham school and, in 1994, Oxford University, where he studied ancient and modern history. After three years living in Russia, where he attempted to set up an airline connecting Samara in the south with Vienna, the then 28-year-old became campaign director of Business for Sterling, which worked to prevent Britain from joining the euro. Although he has never, as far as anyone knows, been a member of a political party, Cummings was headhunted to be director of strategy for the then Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2002. While he was seen as a \u201cyoung, thrusting moderniser\u201d, Cummings quickly offended party traditionalists. He quit the job after only eight months, describing Duncan Smith as incompetent. Following the 2010 general election, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, appointed Cummings as his chief of staff. Many in Whitehall found Cummings as difficult as he found them. In 2013, civil servants in the Department for Education complained to the Independent of an \u201cus-and-them, aggressive, intimidating culture\u201d created by Cummings and Gove. He never hid his disdain for the workings of Whitehall and has derided Westminster figures in eye-catching media interviews and published rambling blogposts that are obsessed over by Westminster insiders. He described prime minister David Cameron as \u201ca sphinx without a riddle\u201d, and former Brexit minister David Davis as \u201cthick as mince, lazy as a toad, and vain as Narcissus\u201d. In 2015, Cummings and the political strategist Matthew Elliott founded Vote Leave, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official EU referendum leave campaign in April of the following year. Since the EU referendum, its tactics have been the subject of a series of high-profile scandals. Vote Leave\u2019s use of data analytics has been scrutinised after the Observer reported that the data-mining company Cambridge Analytica had links to the Canadian digital firm AggregateIQ, on which Vote Leave spent 40% of its campaign budget.\n\nIn July 2018, the Electoral Commission announced Vote Leave had been found guilty of breaking electoral law by overspending, following testimony from whistleblowers. The group was fined \u00a361,000 and referred to the police.\n\nCummings has used his blog to furiously defend himself and the Vote Leave campaign. In March 2019, he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear at a committee of MPs investigating fake news. Frances Perraudin\n\nTom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cThis centralised harvesting of citizen\u2019s data is very suspicious. Why would Dominic Cummings say this was a top priority for the government, given the national crisis we are in? We need immediate assurances about what this data is going to be used for.\u201d\n\nSilkie Carlo, the director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: \u201cThis data grab raises important questions as to the legitimacy, urgency and purpose of such personal information collection. The government must answer these questions urgently.\u201d\n\nThe claim that no personal data would be collected \u201cis at odds with its instruction that government websites should urgently gather \u2018targeted and personalised information\u2019,\u201d Carlo said.\n\n\u201cThis secret instruction and contradictory public statement is cause for concern and undermines public trust at an important time. People need to be able to access government information without worrying about how their data might be tracked, recorded and used.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dominic Cummings reportedly told officials the data collection was a \u2018top priority\u2019. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters\n\nPascal Crowe from Open Rights Group, which campaigns on digital privacy and freedoms, said: \u201cThis decision completely disregards the data rights of ordinary citizens. There is no suggestion of public consultation, seeking consent or promoting safeguards.\n\n\u201cThe public conversation around the use of data has shifted since the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Where is the public\u2019s consent for this? Dominic Cummings may claim to be a pioneering advocate of data science, but when it comes to its ethical use, he is woefully behind.\u201d\n\nOfficials have said the only difference will be that anonymised user data currently collected by individual departments will now be collated across the Gov.uk website, allowing better information on how the site is used as a whole.\n\nA government spokesman said: \u201cAcross the industry, it is normal for organisations to look at how their websites are used to make sure they provide the best possible service.\n\n\u201cIndividual government departments currently collect anonymised user data when people use Gov.uk. The government digital service is working on a project to bring this anonymous data together to make sure people can access all the services they need as easily as possible.\n\n\u201cNo personal data is collected at any point during the process, and all activity is fully compliant with our legal and ethical obligations.\u201d", "description": "Privacy campaigners question urgency of move and motives of PM and Dominic Cummings", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Tom Kibasi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eed5a3479b4e695163a6df408716521197bd53fb/8_57_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=585d2c86dcb823bafccc26fa6086f84a", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
