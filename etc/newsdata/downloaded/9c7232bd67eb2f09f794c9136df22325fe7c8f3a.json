A 2006 expos\u00e9 by an undercover journalist, which made public the vessel\u2019s inhumane living conditions and the widespread abuse of inmates on it, sparked a scandal and forced the closure of the facility.\n\n\u2018The Reno\u2019 was leased by Belgium in 2016 to house 250 asylum seekers as Europe was dealing with the aftermath of the immigration crisis a year earlier. The boat was placed in the port city of Ghent and operated by the British private prison behemoth G4S until April 2017, when a sharp decrease in the number of asylum-seekers rendered it surplus to requirements.\n\nBut, soon, the boat will be back in Ghent housing asylum seekers again. According to the Het Laatste Nieuws newspaper, the Belgian immigration agency Fedasil will soon reopen the facility as part of a larger effort to tackle an influx of refugees. This time the government will be directly responsible for its operation.\n\nThe city itself has allocated some \u20ac727,000 (about $805,000) for \u2018The Reno.\u2019 A public hearing to inform local residents about the plan will be held in early November, the report said.\n\nAlso on rt.com Europe on brink of new refugee crisis \u2018EVEN GREATER\u2019 than 2015 \u2013 German Interior Minister\n\nThe number of people applying for asylum in Belgium has been gradually rising in Belgium since 2016, while the number of people agreeing to voluntary repatriation has been decreasing, government data shows.\n\nIn September there were 2,607 new requests, compared to 2,185 in August and 2,262 in July. As of last month there were 9,172 pending cases involving 11,710 people \u2013 about twice as many as the government considers a normal workload.\n\nBelgium currently has 24,027 accommodation places for asylum-seekers, which are currently 96 percent occupied. Fedasil has recently reopened asylum centers in Lommel and Deurne and is considering asking the national parks service to provide some of their rooms as temporary shelters.\n\nLike this story?
