The heart rate speeds up to compensate. It causes symptoms including dizziness, feeling sick and frequent fainting spells.\n\nCFS is a condition that causes extreme and overwhelming fatigue that doesn\u2019t go away with rest or sleep.\n\nAmy was diagnosed with CFS first when she was 13 years old as she was suffering from extreme exhaustion.\n\nShe was diagnosed with PoTS after she started to get new symptoms in 2013, while she was studying at college.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmy explains: \u2018I noticed I started to feel a lot iller. My symptoms were different from CFS \u2013 I kept fainting and couldn\u2019t walk, I kept getting breathless and I couldn\u2019t cope with any heat.\n\n\u2018I was feeling sick all the time and had extremely severe dizziness. I was totally exhausted all the time. My vision kept going fuzzy or after standing or walking, it would my go black and I couldn\u2019t see.\u2019\n\nAmy at home (Picture: Chris Balcombe for Metro.co.uk)\n\nWhen Amy started having fainting episodes, her mum bought her a wheelchair as they realised that she would collapse when she was walking.\n\nAmy says: \u2018That was my biggest challenge as I was worried about what people would think of me being in a wheelchair.\n\n\u2018I also don\u2019t like the motion of them \u2013 it can make you feel like your on a merry-go-round, but I\u2019m learning to love that wheelchair and those crutches.\u2019\n\nAmy was eventually diagnosed with PoTS when her grandma read an article about the condition and they realised how many of her symptoms matched.\n\nShe was referred to a doctor specialising in the condition who carried out blood tests, tests on her heart and a tilt table test, where Amy was laid down, strapped to a table and moved up and down, while doctors monitored her heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nThe test showed that her heart rate was very high and her blood pressure kept dropping, which was what was causing her to faint, and she was told she did have the condition.\n\nAmy lying down with her cat (Picture: Amy Norris)\n\nShe says: \u2018I finally knew why I was feeling so horrible all the time, but hearing there was no cure for PoTS was something I couldn\u2019t bear to hear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There have been so many days where I have cried for hours about how ill I feel. My biggest worry is being ill for the rest of my life, but somehow I just take one day at a time and try not to worry about the future.\u2019\n\nAmy has been living with PoTS for six years and her parents are her full-time carers as most days she struggles to get out of bed.\n\nShe says: \u2018My life is certainly different from any other 23-year-old. It can be frustrating, infuriating, and incredibly emotional. It\u2019s one heck of a rollercoaster.\n\n\u2018Having PoTS makes me totally disabled. I totally rely on crutches around the house and a wheelchair when I have to go out. Sadly I can\u2019t get out much because of how rough I feel. I\u2019m at home 90% of the time and if I have to go out it will mainly just be for appointments.\n\nAfter a fainting attack in the bathroom (Picture: Amy Norris)\n\n\u2018It takes me all morning just to get out of bed. I have to force myself to get up every day. I use a shower stool when I wash as I am no longer able to stand in the shower because of the number of times I\u2019ve fainted. I\u2019ve honestly lost count the number of times I\u2019ve fainted.\u2019\n\nEvery day, Amy\u2019s heart is constantly racing and when she sits or stands up, it gets faster. Often her heart rate will be 176bpm when the average heart rate is between 60 and 100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have constantly got horrific dizziness and vertigo,\u2019 she says. \u2018All I can feel in my head is this spinning feeling. I constantly feel sick in my stomach and I feel faint all the time.\n\n\u2018Then there\u2019s the lightheadedness and wooziness, which affects my eyesight making my eyes blurry.\n\n\u2018Lying down is my most comfortable position. I can\u2019t stand any longer then five seconds, if I did it would make me even fainter, or I would pass out.\n\nAmy uses crutches around the house (Picture: Amy Norris)\n\n\u2018I have extreme exhaustion. I have to force myself to stay awake, so any little thing I do will completely wear me out even more.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m in constant pain. I get hundreds of migraines, stomach pain, muscular pain, back pain, leg pain, chest pain, nerve pain, joint pain, and the list goes on.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m constantly breathless and it feels like I can\u2019t breathe. I always have purple feet and purple hands. This is to do with bad circulation and blood pooling.\n\n\u2018I constantly feel boiling hot, like I have a really bad temperature. I can\u2019t handle any heat so I won\u2019t go anywhere near a hot bath. I hate hot radiators, and can\u2019t handle boiling hot weather.\n\n\u2018I also have constant gut problems and I have sensitive ears. I can\u2019t stand any loud noises, or someone shouting, thunderstorms, basically anything loud. My eyes are sensitive too. I don\u2019t like bright lights or flashing lights and I\u2019m constantly disorientated. I feel like I\u2019m in a dream land and feel like everything around me doesn\u2019t feel real. It\u2019s a very strange feeling.\n\nAmy checking her heart rate and blood pressure (Picture: Amy Norris)\n\n\u2018I would list all my symptoms but there are just too many. My everyday life is a constant battle but I will keep fighting till someone finds a cure.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmy was prescribed medication but suffered so badly from side effects, she stopped taking it and now her condition can only be managed by lying down as much as possible to prevent her heart rate getting higher.\n\nDealing with the condition has been very difficult but her parents, family and friends are a huge source of support for Amy.\n\nShe says: \u2018My parents have taken care of me day and night. They have helped me with my meals, washing, getting dressed, helping me off the floor when I\u2019ve passed out they help me with literally everything.\n\n\u2018I feel I can\u2019t ever repay my parents for everything they have done for me.\n\nAmy in her PoTS UK t-shirt (Picture: Amy Norris)\n\n\u2018Coping with PoTS and CFS is something I can\u2019t even put into words. I\u2019ve accepted it more now that I have a long term illness but I will never stop believing and praying for a cure.\u2019\n\nAmy has found comfort in reading about other people with the same illness, particularly through Instagram.\n\nShe adds: \u2018It made me feel less alone. For so long I thought I was the only person in the world who must feel this way but when I started reading other stories on people going through the same illness as me, I thought wow, people are going through the same thing.\u2019\n\nAlthough her illness means she spends most of her time at home, Amy still has interests and passions that help her get through each day.\n\nShe says: \u2018I\u2019ve been studying piano since I was 17 years old and I love photography, plant based diets, and story writing.\n\nAmy constantly monitors her heart rate. It sits around 176bpm (Picture: Amy Norris)\n\n\u2018When I became ill I started telling stories to myself and then I thought why not try and put those stories onto paper. It\u2019s my dream one day to have my stories published.\n\n\u2018I make it my goal each week just once a week to do a little something even if it\u2019s just for five minutes. I try no matter how rough it makes me feel.\n\n\u2018When you\u2019re poorly, it\u2019s so hard to do anything, but you\u2019re still making that big effort to try, and just from trying, that is an achievement.\u2019\n\nAmy also has a strong faith and takes comfort from her belief in God.\n\n\u2018I believe that God can take even the really bad things that happen to you and bring something amazing out of them,\u2019 she says.\n\nAmy gets tired quickly, even in her wheelchair (Picture: Amy Norris)\n\n\u2018I keep praying and believing that God will bring something wonderful out from all of this. Being ill has brought me so much closer to God and I will be forever grateful for having a real true friendship with him.\u2019\n\nAlthough the condition has a huge impact on her every day, Amy says most people don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to live like this.\n\nShe explains: \u2018The most frustrating thing I\u2019ve found is how you look well and healthy, but that is not how you feel at all.\n\n\u2018It can be so hard to get people to understand how I\u2019m feeling. People say things that make you think they just don\u2019t understand my illness.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had so many people say so many annoying things to me, like \u201cOh you look well,\u201d \u201cyou don\u2019t look sick,\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re looking better.\u201d\n\nAmy with her parents who are her full-time carers (Picture: Amy Norris)\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t stand it when people say these things. I have to bite my tongue because I never feel like that \u2013 I always feel horrible.\n\n\u2018I feel what people need to understand it\u2019s not how you look and it\u2019s not how you sound, it\u2019s how you feel.\u2019\n\nAmy posts about her conditions on Instagram and wants to raise awareness to help more people understand the reality of living with chronic illness.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very passionate about spreading the awareness of PoTS and finding a cure.\n\n\u2018PoTS UK has set up an awareness month this year for October. I\u2019m so happy that they\u2019re trying to get the awareness out there.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been taking part in the PoTS UK challenge this month, which is taking a photo every day on your social media throughout October and saying on each post how the condition affects your daily life.\n\n\u2018I think from doing this it will help people to truly understand what it\u2019s like to live with this every single day.\u2019\n\nHow to get involved with You Don't Look Sick You Don\u2019t Look Sick is Metro.co.uk\u2019s weekly series that discusses invisible illness and disabilities.
