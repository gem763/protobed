Teesside.\n\nMirror.co.uk can also reveal that while Ben was serving his sentence, his dad killed himself.\n\nSenior coroner for Teesside Clare Bailey recorded a verdict of suicide at the inquest into Craig's death in January 2017.\n\nThe inquest heard how depressed Craig sent suicidal messages to relatives before hanging himself in his bedroom.\n\nCraig sent the texts to his two brothers, Bob and Steven, before they found his body at his ground floor flat in Billingham on November 19, 2016.\n\n(Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)\n\nHe sent the messages in the early hours of the morning and his brothers did not read them until they awoke, the inquest at Teesside Coroner\u2019s Court heard.\n\nThe first message Bob received was at 2.30am and read: \"Goodbye kidda. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I love you. I can\u2019t take any more. My mind\u2019s in turmoil 24/7.\n\nOne sent to Steven at 03.25am read: \"Kidda, I\u2019m going to hang myself now. Sorry about that but send cops round in morn, don\u2019t want Bob finding.\"\n\nThree minutes later Craig sent another text joking: LOL don\u2019t say I\u2019ve lost my sense of humour.\"\n\nA final text received at 5.55am stated: \u2018Sorry for the mess, I would of hoovered up but was in a bit of a rush.x\"\n\n(Image: North News)\n\nThe brothers rushed over to Craig's flat and attempts were made to resuscitate him but it was too late.\n\nA post-mortem showed the 47-year-old was twice the drink-drive limit and there were low levels of cocaine in his system as well as therapeutic medication.\n\nThe inquest heard Mr Wilson had a problem with alcohol abuse and mental health issues including depression and self-harm and had been threatening to hang himself for the past six months.\n\nHe made a previous attempt on his own life about four years ago, his brother Stephen said in a statement read at the inquest, and he had spent some time in hospital, according to Teesside Live.\n\nMr Wilson had also recently separated from his new girlfriend and was \"not happy about the relationship breakdown\", according to Stephen.\n\nIn one of the texts sent to Robert on the day he died, Craig stated how his \u201cmind is in turmoil 24/7\u201d.\n\n(Image: Evening Gazette)\n\nStephen said: \"Craig has been suffering from mental health issues for two years.\n\n\"These issues consisted of self harm and thoughts of suicide. Craig has made previous attempts on his life with the last episode being four years ago when he tried to hang himself but was found in enough time to save him and he spent some time in hospital.\"\n\nAt Ben's trial at Teesside Crown Court in January, 2015, Craig was described as \u201cJekyll and Hyde\u201d character, who had frequently attacked Ben's mother and was jailed for a previous attack.\n\nAfter hearing crashing, shouting and commotion from his parent\u2019s bedroom, Ben raced upstairs after arming himself with a hammer.\n\nHe hit his father at least five times to the head and face with the weapon, leaving him with brain damage and holes in the head.\n\nMr Wilson then left the house, in Norton, before handing himself in at the police station where he told officers he thought he had killed his dad.\n\nParamedics who attended the scene found Mr Wilson Snr on his bed, conscious but not alert with \u201cmultiple holes in his head and face.\"\n\nHe had fractures to the jaw, cheekbone, eye sockets, forehead and nose, and a bleed on the brain and had to be put into an artificial coma and on a ventilator to undergo a tracheotomy.\n\n(Image: Evening Gazette)\n\nHe was in hospital for more than a month where he was fed through a tube. He lost six teeth and was left with permanent scarring and deformity.\n\nWilson, of Billingham, denied attempted murder but admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.\n\nSimon Bickler, QC, defending, said that on the night of the assault, his father mentioned getting knives and threatened to \u201cchop everybody up\u201d.\n\nHe said Wilson \u201cundoubtedly feared for his mother\u2019s safety\u201d when he heard smashing in the bedroom.\n\n\u201cThe use of that weapon was very much of the moment. The defendant ceased the attack of his own volition,\u201d said Mr Bickler.\n\nHe said the victim made a significant recovery from his injuries while his son felt remorse for the isolated incident, was vulnerable and did not pose a risk to the public.\n\nJudge Simon Bourne-Arton QC said Ben could have been locked up for 12 years or more for the assault, but he was given a reduced sentence because of his good character and the provocation he had faced.\n\nThe court heard that he had grown up in \"an atmosphere of violence, fear and intimidation\" and was subjected to violence himself.\n\nBut when Mr Wilson Snr was sober, the dad and son had a good relationship and worked alongside each other.\n\nBut he denigrated, humiliated and belittled his son when drunk, said the judge.\n\n(Image: Evening Gazette)\n\nMr Wilson Snr had sent a text to his estranged wife on the eve of his son's sentencing that said: \u201cHope all goes well tomorrow for Ben. Wish I could do more.\u201d\n\nBack in 2015 a a \"Free Ben Wilson\" e-petition gathered thousands of signatures from around the world, while a \"Help Free Ben Wilson\" Facebook page has hundreds of likes.\n\nThe petition, set up by Marie Taylor, says: \"Ben got 6 years for protecting his mother and himself from an abusive man under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\"Ben has recently become a father and is not going to be able to bring his child up and give him a better life than what he was brought up in.\n\n\"Save this boy from more years of [torture] he has suffered enough and his family.\"\n\nAnita Homer, who signed the petition, said: \"This is appalling!!! We have a wonky, unfair and non standardised jurisdiction.\n\n\"There are so many cases where a person has intentionally killed someone and only received very short sentences.\n\n\"This lad's behaviour was not intentional. He only wanted to protect his mom.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said they would never comment on individual cases.\n\nIf you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operates a free phoneline open 24/7.
