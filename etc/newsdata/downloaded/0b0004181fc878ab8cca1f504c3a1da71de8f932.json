Imagine for example \u2014 there is no evidence of this but is purely an illustration of why a searching inquiry is required \u2014 that the government \u201cwhistleblower\u201d in the Ukrainian matter is a close associate of a central figure in the Obama administration\u2019s national security apparatus, and perhaps one deeply connected to, say, the Iran nuclear deal or the Paris climate accords. Everyone knows motive matters. We need to know the motives of all involved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president\u2019s impeachment defense team should publish the list of witnesses they expect to call. That should include former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, former FBI director James B. Comey, former CIA director John Brennan, former national intelligence director James R. Clapper Jr. and former FBI personnel Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Add to the list everyone involved in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants for U.S. citizens connected to these matters, everyone who touched or forwarded the bogus \u201cSteele dossier\u201d about Trump, Russia and the 2016 election, and every member of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s team, which didn\u2019t sufficiently investigate the dossier. Testimony from all of them is needed to explore what happened and why, leading up to the Schiff sham.\n\nThe president\u2019s team should also make clear that his defense in this political trial will include examining the political equivalent of prosecutorial misconduct by Schiff, beginning with his alleged contact with the whistleblower before the complaint became public. The whistleblower will of course also have to testify, so that motives can be determined, as discussed above. Trump is entitled to every bit of evidence his accusers possess, just as he is to making the case that the impeachment is a rush to judgment and that those acting as prosecutors here are the corrupt actors, not the president.\n\nTrump needs a team that is wholly new and wholly independent of the staff that has been in his circle until now. To represent him in the Senate trial, he needs a former federal judge, preferably with federal prosecutor experience, from far outside the Beltway and unconcerned with the opinion of D.C. elites or invitations to the right parties \u2014 someone in the prime of his or her career and tough as nails.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president also needs a spokesperson for the impeachment trial with superb TV skills and a willingness to battle the daily drumbeat of biased coverage. The public needs to be reminded daily of the unrelenting effort to oust Trump by whatever means necessary; of the \u201cinsurance policy\u201d Strzok and Page sought in case Trump was elected; of the Mueller report that found no collusion with Russia but never dealt with the origins of the irregular investigation of the major party candidate by rogue operators. The spokesperson needs to be relentless on those subjects, committed to broadening the scope of the discussion, and able to speak forcefully about Schiff\u2019s circus and the stakes involved in unseating a president. I suggest former House member and now Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz, who would bring a Tony Snow-like confidence and demeanor to what will be a months-long trial.\n\nYes, months long. You read that right. Schiff and his media allies may expect a narrow, carefully limited show trial. But the Senate will set the rules for its trial, and the president\u2019s team should announce now that he demands the opportunity to fully clear his name. His base can be rallied to buttress that demand.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) may not want to see the Senate tied up for half a year in grinding proceedings, even though that is what\u2019s needed. If the Senate\u2019s majority prefers, it could appoint a special committee to hear the proceedings and report its findings to the main body, consistent with the 1993 U.S. Supreme Court case of Nixon v. United States involving the impeachment of federal judge Walter Nixon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump should demand the opportunity to use the Senate trial to turn the tables on his would-be Inspector Javert. McConnell should announce that the president will be given that chance. The left will call it a \u201cscorched earth\u201d approach. Trump supporters will call it just. Those in the middle will simply call it overdue.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Senate should plan for a months-long trial.
