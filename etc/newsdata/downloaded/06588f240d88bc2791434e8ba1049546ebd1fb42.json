To some, this will be a dream come true. Usually, some, if not all, will opt to celebrate this achievement with their families. They will tend to invite their kith and kin to be part of this important milestone in their lives. Participating in \"Strictly Come Dancing\" is a target for most professional and aspiring dancers.\n\nNow that it is heading to Blackpool, a lot of contestants will want to have some of the people who are dear to them to attend the show, reports Metro.\n\nWho will blink first?\n\nIn previous seasons, some participants have tended to invite their grandmothers to watch them perform. Unfortunately, the BBC has decided not to tolerate that anymore hence declaring any invitations before Blackpool null and void.\n\nHowever, it appears like not everyone is going to honor that order from the BBC. Already a couple of \"Strictly Come Dancing\" stars have gone against the directive, for instance, Kevin Fletcher and Saffron Barker, who choose to violate the set rule by visiting their grannies before Blackpool.\n\nIt is now becoming evident that nannies to some \"Strictly Come Dancing\" show will be present in future episodes.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most. We'll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn't miss. TV Shows\n\nIn the previous episodes, nannies to certain dancing stars have been in attendance. Jue Sugg\u2019s nan seemed to enjoy seeing his grandson alongside Dianne Buswell on stage last year.\n\nBad move by the BBC?\n\nBBC has its reasons for deciding not to allow any grannies to attend their show until Blackpool week. However, it raises some eyebrows on whether this is a good or bad move for the BBC. Honestly speaking, contestants have always wanted their family members and close friends to watch them during this stage of the show.\n\nContestants have always tried to showcase an amazing dance performance whenever their family members have been in attendance. Previously, Joe pulled off an exceptional Quickstep to Copacabana\u2019s Dancin\u2019 Fool.\n\nJoe and his partner Dianne Buswell received 10 points from Bruno Tonioli, Shirley Ballas, and Darcey Bussell. Craig Revel Horwood awarded them eight points, thus totaling 38 points.\n\nRumors have it that Joe was inspired by Phyllis, his nan who was in the audience watching him perform.\n\nJoe and Dianne were moved by the judges\u2019 verdict, which guaranteed them qualification to the next round.\n\nIt still seems like this directive by the BBC has not been taken seriously by \"Strictly Come Dancing|\" stars. The fans are looking forward to the next episodes of this show to confirm if the BBC will be enforcing their law. Furthermore, Strictly Come Dancing fans are also waiting for the Blackpool Week to witness some great dances from remaining contestants.", "description": "In previous seasons, some participants have tended to invite their grandmothers to watch them perform.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Ramon Sanchez", "Read More On The Same Topic Ramon Sanchez", "Day Fianc\u00e9'", "Larissa Comes To Farrah Abraham S Defense After Plastic Surgery Diss", "Angela Unlikely To Have Her Own Child", "Only One Egg Left In Ovary", "Day Fiance'S' Tim Malcolm On Transgender Rumors"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/17/os/b_1200x630/on-strictly-come-dancing-makers-warns-no-more-nans-till-blackpool-image-source-bbc-strictly-come-dancingyoutube_2340945.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
