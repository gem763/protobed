Investigations continue so we're gonna move to Washington. Where that testimony by former top a Russia advisor Fiona hill. Has put spotlight on president Trump's personal attorney. Rudy Giuliani and in that testimony Vienna Fiona saying that former national security advisor. John Bolton referred to Rudy Giuliani as a hand grenade. Who's going to blow everybody up so want to bring in Kathryn falters in our DC bureau I'm to discuss this. Catherine you know Fiona and this testimony also she described this tense. Altercation between. John Bolton and Gordon sound land so what was that about. We're and I quote that you read right there in which says she called the president's personal attorney a quote hand grenade he's going to blow everything up of course.

With Ukraine you know that she wasn't there during that July 25 phone call that kicked off this impeachment inquiry but. I will say that Giuliani is responding to John Bolton in a statement to ABC news he says he's disappointed in John. But he says I'm not sure he realized. I received all this evidence as part is my representation.

That Giuliani's relationship with those two leaders to business associates who were arrested last week is under investigation of course by the southern district of New York the same. District in which Giuliani grand but that Giuliani is telling us and repeatedly that he's received no indication that he's under investigation which isn't necessarily rare it's. If you are under investigation it's probably unlikely that they would tell Giuliani at this point you remember when the two were arrested his two associates were arrested last week.
