No-one wants to see anyone miss cricket through a head injury. But Test cricket is a brutal sport, it\u2019s a sport where countries go hell for leather against each other,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure when Steve comes in Jofra will be in Joe Root\u2019s ear wanting the ball, no doubt about that. Jofra will be excited to continue that battle.\n\n\u201cThere will be a period in this game where those two come together again and touch wood I\u2019m on the pitch to view it. That\u2019s the intensity Test cricket brings, that\u2019s the theatre.\n\n\u201cI might be stood at mid-on but I\u2019ll be excited when Jofra asks for that ball. It was a really tasty bit of cricket at Lord\u2019s, Smith was on 70 or 80, playing beautifully, and Jofra went from 84mph to 95mph. He was really charging in.\n\n\u201cThat sort of cricket is awesome to watch on the telly or from the stands but when you\u2019re stood at mid-on it\u2019s pretty special. Hopefully we can have a battle like that again.\u201d\n\nBroad and Archer will not be joined by local favourite James Anderson on his home turf, the 37-year-old great having admitted defeat in his bid to shake off a calf injury.\n\nEngland\u2019s record wicket-taker will have been stung by the frustrating end to what is surely his final Ashes contest but has yet to indicate any thoughts of retirement.\n\nAnd Broad, for one, expects his long-term partner to be back on the big stage again soon.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of cricket left in him,\u201d said Broad.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know for certain but, from the conversations I\u2019ve had, he\u2019s looking at the winter and getting fit and wanting to be on that trip (to New Zealand).\n\n\u201cI had in my mind the idea that it was almost written in the stars that he would be back, open the bowling at the James Anderson End and bowl us to victory, but that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d", "description": "Round two of the Ashes battle between Steve Smith and Jofra Archer promises to be \u201cbrutal\u201d but brilliant viewing, according to England\u2019s Stuart Broad.
