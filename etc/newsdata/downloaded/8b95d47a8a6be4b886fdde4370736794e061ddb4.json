Our own Shamin Chibba, who is in advertising and has written plays at the Market Theatre; a 22-year-old roboticist from Benin, Kelvin Adantchede; Priscillar Matara, who is a filmmaker from Botswana; Laurence Gnaro, a technician from Togo; an academic on Genocide and Neurolaw from Mauritius, Sabah Carrim; and Ghanaian banker Asiedu Benneh are some of the writers featuring in the anthology,\u201d she said.\n\nThe stories range from the fantastical of a re-imagined future Africa, to experiencing parental separation and questioning religion, sexuality, first loves to power relations between domestic workers and their employers as seen from the eyes of the domestic worker\u2019s child.\n\nThe common thread among the stories is that they are written by young adults who give a fresh new look at topics such as family, friendships and sexuality.\n\nThe anthology will be available at selected book stores for R200 and libraries across Africa from November 1.\n\nFor more information visit www.Goethe.de/AYA or contact Zukiswa Wanner at afroyoungadult@gmail.com.", "description": "A highly anticipated Afro young adult anthology, Water Birds on the Lake Shore: An Anthology of African Young-Adult Fiction, will finally be hitting stores this November.", "authors": ["Avantika Seeth"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9538/c81909a572d74e179d0fc999a863b8c9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
