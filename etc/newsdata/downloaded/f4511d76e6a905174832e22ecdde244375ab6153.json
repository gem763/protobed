Because the Olsen twins were bartending, and so many people wanted to see. Why were the Olsen twins bartending? Because Anna Wintour decided that people should get excited about shopping again, and that the first night of Fashion Week would be the perfect time for her initiative.\n\nIt was called Fashion\u2019s Night Out \u2014 and every store worth its Proenza PS1 bags was participating. The Olsen twins (the designers for The Row) tended bar at Bergdorf Goodman to help draw people into the store. On the same night, Wintour was at a Macy\u2019s in Queens doing an appearance with Michael Kors at the height of his Project Runway fame; Vogue editor Hamish Bowles was doing karaoke at Juicy Couture; and the designers for indie brand Vena Cava (now defunct) were in a dunk tank at Bird in Brooklyn. Employees at Barneys were running out to get more Champagne to serve the hundreds of guest flooding into the store.\n\nWhich was the goal. Fashion\u2019s Night Out was announced on May 20, 2009, at a press conference featuring Mayor Michael Bloomberg; Wintour; George Fertitta, the CEO of NYC & Company; and Steven Kolb, the executive director of the CFDA. Fashion\u2019s Night Out took place on September 10, 2009, 360 days after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. The world was changing. Macy\u2019s president Terry Lundgren said when the night was announced that it was \u201ca great program that will get New Yorkers and tourists excited about shopping again.\u201d Proceeds from the promotional $30 T-shirts went to the September 11 memorial, and shoppers were encouraged to donate clothes to benefit the New York City AIDS Fund. Anna Wintour called it \u201cour global fashion stimulus package,\u201d likely in reference to the Recovery Act, an actual stimulus package that President Obama signed in February 2009. The retail scene was bleak \u2014 2008 had the lowest retail-sales figures for 35 years. Brian Moylan, then writing for Gawker, remembered that the site kept track of the empty storefronts in Nolita and Soho. People were not shopping.\n\nFashion\u2019s Night Out was based on the premise that if you bring a horse to a Champagne fountain, they will eventually concede and drink. There were 800 events across New York City, open until 11 p.m., serving enough booze to make every loss-prevention specialist in New York nervous. Fashion\u2019s Night Out was the prototype of a kind of fashion event we\u2019re all familiar with now: splashy celebrity appearances and photo ops, free or cheap merch, booze, and little to no expectation of buying anything. It was also a shit show.\n\nAnna Wintour, the orchestrator and face of the night, started the events early at a Macy\u2019s in Queens. Moylan, who was on the unofficial Wintour beat for Gawker, took the V train to Queens and followed Wintour to Bloomingdale\u2019s. The September Issue had just come out; Wintour was a big draw. But Michael Kors at the peak of his Project Runway fame was bigger. A woman at Macy\u2019s told Moylan she was there because, \u201cI love Project Runway. I just want to see Michael Kors \u2026 Some Anna woman is going to be here too, but I don\u2019t know who she is. Some magazine woman. I know who Nina Garcia is, though.\u201d\n\nClockwise from left: Anna Wintour, Gwen Stefani Photo: Jerritt Clark/2009 Getty Images Victoria Beckham Photo: Patrick McMullan/Patrick McMullan via Getty Image Giuseppe Zanotti, Rihanna Photo: George Napolitano/2009 Getty Images Clockwise from left: Anna Wintour, Gwen Stefani Photo: Jerritt Clark/2009 Getty Images Giuseppe Zanotti, Rihanna Photo: George Napolitano/2009 Getty Im... more Clockwise from left: Anna Wintour, Gwen Stefani Photo: Jerritt Clark/2009 Getty Images Giuseppe Zanotti, Rihanna Photo: George Napolitano/2009 Getty Images Victoria Beckham Photo: Patrick McMullan/Patrick McMullan via Getty Image\n\nMadison and Fifth Avenues, as well as blocks of Soho, turned into fraternity rows \u2014 with patrons bouncing from party to party. When I asked James*, a manager at Barneys Madison Avenue at the time, what he remembered from the night, he said, \u201cCrowds, crowds, crowds, crowds.\u201d Barneys had some kind of event on each floor \u2014 an artist hand-painting T-shirts, hand massages, salsa lessons, and a meet-and-greet with Thom Browne. James said it \u201cturned into quite the party atmosphere.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t know the exact number of guests, but that it was in \u201cthe thousands, for sure,\u201d adding \u201cIt was like a bar crawl for stores.\u201d\n\nWhich became a problem. The fashion industry loves to give out free Champagne to sweeten the deal of a $1,000 price tag. But with that many people in the store, the biggest issue was who got served alcohol. \u201cWe ran out of Champagne and Prosecco and we had to run out by more, and then it was a problem of who was getting it, because it was just being handed out to everyone.\u201d This wasn\u2019t unique to Barneys by any means. When Fashion\u2019s Night Out was canceled in 2013, BuzzFeed wrote that one of the reasons it needed to end was because \u201cbooze was handed out recklessly, probably to a lot of underage people.\u201d\n\nHandling cocktails across the street on the seventh floor of Bergdorf Goodman were the Olsen twins. Mary Kate was tipped by a \u201cconfused patron,\u201d but they were a big draw. So big that the doors of the BG restaurant came off its hinges and the seventh floor had to be shut down briefly for crowd control.\n\nBergdorf had activities on each of its eight floors. In addition to the Olsen twins, Zac Posen was painting one-of-a-kind dresses modeled by Anna Cleveland in the windows facing Fifth Avenue. Padma Lakshmi, then on Top Chef, judged a cook-off between six designers at the restaurant. Victoria Beckham and other designers signed Fashion\u2019s Night Out T-shirts (the ones that benefited charity.) Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley \u2014 also fresh off of The September Issue \u2014 judged a life-size version of a fashion board game with Donna Karan, Linda Fargo, and Robert Verdi. Isaac Mizrahi performed in the restaurant, and Phyllis Posnick, a Vogue editor, curated a special photography exhibition on the third floor. \u201cAt Bergdorf Goodman we kept the store open late with a more the merrier mentality and in return more people than we ever imagined came,\u201d Casey Rodgers Fleming, the store\u2019s former director of PR and events, said. Another former Bergdorf employee, Emma*, said that there was a line wrapping around the building. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, Let\u2019s have a little corner with a swing in it so people can have a place to take an Instagram. It was like, Lets let\u2019s put a swing in the window, get someone to perform in the window and have that go live on Fifth Avenue.\u201d\n\nClockwise from top: Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen Photo: Paul Morigi/2009 Getty Images Hugh Jackman Photo: Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic Sarah Jessica Parker, Oscar de la Renta, Barbara Walters, and Bette Midler Photo: Kevin Mazur/2009 Kevin Mazur Clockwise from top: Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen Photo: Paul Morigi/2009 Getty Images Hugh Jackman Photo: Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic Sarah Jessica Parker, Osc... more Clockwise from top: Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen Photo: Paul Morigi/2009 Getty Images Hugh Jackman Photo: Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic Sarah Jessica Parker, Oscar de la Renta, Barbara Walters, and Bette Midler Photo: Kevin Mazur/2009 Kevin Mazur\n\nThe scene downtown in Soho was similarly chaotic. Sienna Miller and Rihanna were making appearances. Rihanna, dressed in a hoodie and opaque sunglasses, caused an excited fan to knock over a rack of clothing, which hit another patron in the head. A woman at Saks yelled at Justin Timberlake, \u201cI\u2019ll wait forever, Justin!\u201d Lauren Sherman, writing for Forbes, said that Sienna Miller\u2019s appearance at Intermix in Soho \u201cmade Prince Street unnavigable.\u201d\n\nAt Bird, a Brooklyn store that specializes in indie designers, it was a big party without the high-wattage celebrity. Jack Sachs, who was working at Bird at the time, said he hadn\u2019t been to anything like it before. The theme was \u201cDisco Carnival.\u201d There were food trucks and cotton-candy machines and designers in dunk tanks and a DJ from LCD Soundsystem. Like their compatriots in Manhattan, the Bird employees hadn\u2019t expected a crowd. \u201cWe were expecting a couple hundred people and it was maybe twice as much,\u201d Sachs said. \u201cFrom the retail perspective, that\u2019s too many people to have in a store to worry about cotton candy getting on the Proenza bags. But it felt like an across-town music festival, especially in the beginning.\u201d\n\nNot that there weren\u2019t growing pains. \u201cAny space is well-planned at capacity, but when you triple that, you realize you didn\u2019t think you should need to have a publicly accessible restroom, suddenly you\u2019ve got a line of 25 people in the Korean restaurant next door and a very unhappy restaurant owner. The fashion crowd is pretty well-behaved until they get that sixth or seventh drink. And then I think the entitlement can flip in and suddenly there\u2019s cocktails on the sidewalk.\u201d\n\nThe party officially ended at 11 p.m. James remembers walking out of Barneys toward the end of the night to go home and seeing the Upper East Side filled with people. \u201cI could not believe it. It definitely felt like New Year\u2019s Eve. I felt like everyone was celebrating for whatever reason, because there was nothing to celebrate. And that has always stuck with me, even ten years later.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, when they returned to the stores, most discovered they had made little to no money. Sherman wrote her article, \u201cFashion\u2019s Night Out Falls Short\u201d for Forbes. \u201cThere may have been 700 in-store events to choose from in New York City alone, but consumers kept their wallets snapped shut.\u201d She also reported that the item that did sell well was the $30 promotional T-shirt. Wintour herself, apparently, encouraged an unsuspecting Ralph Lauren customer to buy the T-shirt.\n\nBut retailers were famously not benefiting from that shirt. \u201cWe were like, okay, well, we made $0. If we\u2019re going to do this again, we\u2019ve got to do it differently because it really turned into people coming in just for anything that was free. But it definitely got excitement for the retailers,\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cIt felt like cleaning up your house after you had too many people over. Do you, are you happy they\u2019re gone? Yes. Was it fun to have them over? Sure,\u201d Sachs said. Once reality set in after the hangover from the night before, it became clear it wasn\u2019t the cash cow \u2014 or stimulus package, to quote Anna \u2014 that was promised. \u201cBy at the end of year one, everyone was ready to say, Great, that was fun. How can we monetize this? And of course that had been a theory all along.\u201d The celebrities, the gimmicks, and the free Champagne were not enough to get people in the throes of a recession to buy a Gucci jacket. But it was enough to make them party.\n\nBoth of the women who I spoke to who worked for Bergdorf, though, called the night a success in terms of getting exposure for the store. Emma remembers it now fondly, \u201cI don\u2019t think about the bottom line in sales loss because of all of the different levels of publicity and earned media it got us. For me, it was a win.\u201d\n\nWhen it was announced that Fashion\u2019s Night Out would no longer continue in New York in 2013, the response from the media was \u201cGood riddance.\u201d This may have something to do with the fact that in 2012, partygoers smashed a car\u2019s windshield in Soho. But its influence lingers. Sherman points out that the event debuted before the so-called \u201cretail apocalypse\u201d \u2014 before store owners regularly had to figure out how to drag people offline and into their shops. Now, retailers feel obligated to offer entertainment (food halls, ropes courses, indoor ski slopes), even though they know it won\u2019t translate into sales. And thanks to influencers, throwing a fashion party just for the brand awareness has become commonplace. FNO might not have been a stimulus package for the retail economy, but it became a playbook for the attention economy. Long after the event itself has ended, the free Champagne flows on.\n\n* Names have been changed.\n\nFrom left: Photo: Patrick McMullan/Patrick McMullan via Getty Image Photo: JB REED/Bloomberg via Getty Images From left: Photo: Patrick McMullan/Patrick McMullan via Getty Image Photo: JB REED/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nStay in touch.
