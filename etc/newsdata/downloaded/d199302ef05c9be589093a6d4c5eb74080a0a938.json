August Chinese showed exports posted a surprise drop, which suggests exporters are not front-loading sales. The data will start looking like a trainwreck when the 15% and 30% tariffs take effect. The trade war is at a critical juncture where Beijing will need to decide if they want to deliver more stimulus to accommodate a slowing economy or should they first focus on delivering enough concessions to the Trump administration to support a de-escalation of the recent round of tariff threats.\n\nBrexit\n\nThe British reversed earlier losses after UK PM Boris Johnson reportedly signaled to cabinet ministers the government would have to accept a further three-month delay to Brexit if the courts forced him. Johnson still may try to sabotage any extension, but for now, sterling is continue to stabilize here.\n\nKhalid al-Falih appears to have fallen out of place with the kingdom, perhaps its primarily with how low prices have been despite all the Saudi-led production cuts. Al-Falih will be replaced as the Saudi energy minister, a signal that we could see a possible shift in strategy at the Sept. 12 OPEC+ strategy meeting in Abu Dhabi. His replacement, industry veteran Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman is seen as very capable to maintaining all the relationships, especially the one Al-Falih brokered with Russian energy minister Novak. Last week Al-Falih was removed at Chariman of Saudi Aramco.\n\nThe new energy minister, Abdulaziz is half-brother to the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. We could see this move suggest will see more pressure from the Saudis for OPEC + to stabilize prices with further cuts.\n\nprices are slightly higher as demand for safe-havens have tentatively eased up. It seems gold will continue to rise with massive stimulus measures that will stem from bad news with the global economy. Gold could struggle this week if we don\u2019t see a clear path for lower rates and the expansion of bond purchases by the ECB. With many of the ECB hawks becoming vocal, a sign that could mean they are ready to concede on Thursday, we could see this rate decision deliver a strong dovish message that will include steps for QE2.\n\nGold\u2019s bullish trend has had many pullbacks and the current one might not be over with. Today\u2019s move higher is hardly a rally and could fizzle out. Key support for gold remains the $1,470 to $1,500 zone.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by MarketPulse (Ed Moya) covering: GBP/USD, XAU/USD, Gold Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
