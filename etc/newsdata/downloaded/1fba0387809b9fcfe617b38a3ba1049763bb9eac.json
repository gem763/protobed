There aren\u2019t any shoes or apparel for sale right now, but on his Mixer stream, Blevins said, \u201cI can\u2019t say specifically what is in the works with Adidas, but use your imagination.\u201d Adidas says that the partnership might lead to products \u201cin either the physical or virtual world.\u201d\n\nApparel companies signing deals with gaming stars is a relatively new phenomenon. Nike signed a deal earlier this year to make jerseys for the League of Legends Pro League in China, which are expected to debut at the 2019 League of Legends World Championship in Paris in October. Champion and K-Swiss have also signed apparel deals with individual teams and players.\n\nThe partnership with Adidas is far from Ninja\u2019s first with a brand. He\u2019s long partnered with Samsung and has appeared in the company\u2019s #TeamGalaxy ad campaign, promoted the Galaxy S10 exclusive K-Pop-themed Fortnite skin and emote, and opened a Samsung-made Fortnite \u201csupply drop\u201d with a Galaxy Note 9 inside. Ninja also makes money from a number of other deals, including a long-running Red Bull sponsorship, YouTube ads, and he gets paid to play certain games, including a reported $1 million for playing EA\u2019s Apex Legends at its launch earlier this year. He also just released a book.\n\nOn his Mixer stream, Ninja said more details on the collaboration will be out soon.\n\nUpdate August 27th, 7:45PM ET: Added information from Adidas about the length of the deal and that the partnership may lead to physical or virtual products.", "description": "Streamer Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins has announced a partnership with Adidas.
