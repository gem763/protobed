In so doing, he claimed that each AR-15 and AK-47 in private hands is a \u201cpotential instrument of terror.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper then asked O\u2019Rourke how he plans to get people to hand over their rifles.\n\nO\u2019Rourke responded by explaining that he expects complains with the mandatory buybacks. He said, \u201cI expect my fellow Americans to follow the law. The same way we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now, we don\u2019t go door to door to do anything to enforce the law. I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, non-gun owners alike, to follow the law.\u201d\n\nCooper then followed up by asking what O\u2019Rourke plans to do if Americans do not comply.\n\nO\u2019Rourke said, \u201cIf someone does not turn an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it, in an attempt to intimidate\u2026then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, there will be other consequences from law enforcement.\u201d", "description": "During the October 15, Democrat debate \"Beto\" O'Rourke made clear that he will take AR-15s away from owners who refuse to hand them over.", "authors": ["Awr Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181329067-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
