(Tinta Fresca Chiapas/Tinta Fresca Chiapas)\n\nResidents of a Mexican city, reportedly tired of waiting for the mayor to fix a local road, dragged him behind a truck through the streets Tuesday morning.\n\nEleven people have been arrested in Las Margaritas, a municipality in the state of Chiapas, for their role in the attack on Mayor Jorge Luis Escand\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez, according to El Universal.\n\nThis is the second time that farmers have attacked the mayor, who said he will press charges for abduction and attempted murder, according to the BBC. His office was trashed four months ago.\n\nDigital newspaper Tabasco Al Minuto tweeted a shaky video that shows a couple of men waiting at the back of a dark Toyota pickup as a gang of men pulled the mayor toward the vehicle.\n\n#Enterate Circula en redes video en el que pobladores del ejido Santa Rita en el municipio de #LasMargaritas, #Chiapas, suben en una camioneta al alcalde Jorge Luis Escand\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez.

Some people were hurt during a tussle between police and Escand\u00f3n\u2019s captors.\n\nThe mayor was reportedly unharmed, although he was being examined by medical professionals, according to the state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office, which says the National Guard and the secretary of security and citizen protection were called to patrol the streets.\n\nAttacks on political figures are not an anomaly in Mexico. Local politicians are frequently targeted by criminal organizations when they don\u2019t comply with gang demands, but it\u2019s less common for local officials to be assaulted because of empty campaign promises, according to the BBC.\n\nChiapas is the poorest state in Mexico, with nearly 77 percent of its population living in poverty, according to 2018 statistics from Coneval, the official Mexican institution that measures poverty in the country.\n\nIn April 2018, 200 Las Margaritas residents kidnapped 24 municipal, state and federal government employees to demand that a road be built by then-Mayor Jos\u00e9 Domingo V\u00e1zquez L\u00f3pez, according to Mexico News Daily.\n\nThe employees were taken hostage when the upset citizens went to request a meeting with the mayor. Because the mayor was absent, the group captured the employees and damaged the government building.\n\nMonths before the kidnapping, V\u00e1zquez was held captive for days because of his failure to follow through on an agreement to build a road, according to Vanguardia.\n\nEscand\u00f3n himself has been arrested for being part of a fracas with supporters of a rival political candidate, but he was later released based on a lack of evidence, the BBC reported.\n\nRead more:\n\nBaltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh resigns amid book scandal\n\nA mayor reportedly said her city isn\u2019t ready for a black leader.
