Opponents of the route are also challenging state regulators at the Texas Railroad Commission who gave Kinder Morgan the green light while accepting millions of dollars from the oil and gas industry.\n\nUnlike the Dakota Access Pipeline project that sparked massive protests in 2016 and 2017 over fears it would hurt the environment and sacred Native American sites, opposition to the Texas pipeline has largely played out of public view.\n\nKinder Morgan\u2019s pipeline project comes as an unprecedented boom in oil and natural gas production in the Permian Basin has catapulted the nation to the forefront of the global shale market. Last year, the U.S. surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world\u2019s largest crude oil producer, according to an assessment by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nNatural gas is a byproduct of oil drilling, and without the proper infrastructure to move it from the Permian Basin, companies end up burning off excess through a process known as flaring, Kinder Morgan spokesman Allen Fore said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the purpose of this project, to capture that natural gas and ship it to market,\u201d Fore said.\n\nIf completed, the pipeline will deliver up to 2 billion cubic feet (56.6 million cubic meters) of natural gas \u2014 enough to fuel 31,500 homes for one day \u2014as it passes through 16 Texas counties.\n\nTexas already has the most expansive pipeline network in the country with more than 460,000 miles (740,250 kilometers) of channels zigzagging through it.\n\nBut the project is at the center of a fight that has grounded an unlikely alliance assembled across the state\u2019s central region, where momentum has grown in calling for the company to reroute the pipeline and in urging for further industry regulation in oil-friendly Texas. Those strange bedfellows have held townhalls, formed grassroots community campaigns, and lodged lawsuits against Kinder Morgan.\n\nOpponents of the route have pointed to the potential contamination of the region\u2019s porous Edwards Aquifer, the impact it would have on an environmentally sensitive area, and the lack of public engagement and oversight in the routing process.\n\nKinder Morgan has repeatedly stated the pipeline won\u2019t pose any safety threat.\n\nThere is also concern that Kinder Morgan\u2019s success would set a precedent for other companies interested in building conduits through Hill Country, said Chuck Lesniak, who serves on an advisory committee for the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.\n\n\u201cI do know that the industry is paying attention to this project, and the legal issues, because from a legal standpoint, if this goes south on Kinder Morgan, it has enormous impacts on other pipeline projects proposed for Texas,\u201d Lesniak said.\n\nA judge has ruled in favor of the Houston-based company in one legal challenge attempting to block the project on grounds that the Texas Railroad Commission doesn\u2019t provide enough state oversight or regulation; that decision is being appealed.\n\nFore said the company has made 150 routing adjustments and is not considering changing the pipeline\u2019s set path. The company has started preliminary work, including marking the construction space and leveling the land, but no pipeline has been laid in the ground.\n\nClashes between rural landowners and companies seeking to seize property are not uncommon in Texas, where an estimated 95% of the land is privately owned. Although landowners are compensated for pipeline operators\u2019 use of easements, they often argue the money provided isn\u2019t enough.\n\nUnlike the Texas Public Utility Commission rules that electric, telephone and water utilities must follow, oil and gas companies do not need to seek the approval of the Texas Railroad Commission or affected municipalities for their proposed route. They also have no formal public process to hear from affected landowners.\n\nThe commission has said it does not approve of whether a pipeline is necessary.\n\n\u201cWe approve of whether they have met certain requirements and given us information that we need so we know this is a pipeline \u2026 about to be constructed so we can go out and inspect and put it on our inspection schedule,\u201d said Railroad Commission spokeswoman Ramona Nye.\n\nTexas\u2019 lack of oversight on the pipeline industry allows companies to make unilateral determinations about the best route, said Luke Ellis, an attorney representing roughly 40 landowners, including Frantzen, in their disputes with Kinder Morgan.\n\nFor Frantzen, it could be the end to his way of life at his 260-acre (105-hectare) ranch. He called it a sentimental moment when he picked up an array of deer antler sheds littering his ranch one day this summer.\n\n\u201cNo one has fought (Kinder Morgan) harder and no one has fought them longer than we have in the Hill Country,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Clarice Silber on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ClariceSilber", "description": "FREDERICKSBURG, Texas (AP) \u2014 One of the longest proposed new natural gas pipelines in the U.S. is set to run through Heath Frantzen's property in the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/84af82_pipeline-fight-texas-70554-andy-sansom-andy-sansom-walks-on-his-property-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
