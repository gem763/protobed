This year\u2019s chair, Ellen Weintraub, has attracted considerable attention thanks to the FEC\u2019s important role in regulating and enforcing federal campaign finance law, which is a hot topic right now. As chair, Weintraub has been rushing around giving interviews, tweeting and generally weighing in on a whole host of topics both within and outside of the FEC\u2019s area of expertise.\n\nUnfortunately, while Weintraub\u2019s tweets and interviews might make for good soundbites and clickbait, they are harming the legitimacy of the institution she purports to serve. Commissioners are meant to be independent and neutral arbiters of campaign finance law. Yet Weintraub\u2019s statements indicate that she has prematurely judged matters that could come before the FEC, and that she radically rejects any legal perspective other than her own. Not only that, she risks misleading the public about what the FEC does and what campaign finance law really says. Not surprisingly, Weintraub\u2019s activities are causing consternation and confusion in several quarters, including on Capitol Hill, and people are starting to ask questions, including about her possible misuse of government resources for ideological and political purposes.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWeintraub has used her position at the FEC to take on the president of the United States. She repeatedly challenged his allegations of voter fraud in 2016 in New Hampshire and, in the context of discussing the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, questioned the legitimacy of the Electoral College. The FEC has no authority over either of these issues. Weintraub nonetheless used her official title and Commission letterhead in her public attacks on the president, which made it look as if she was acting on the agency\u2019s behalf and with other commissioners\u2019 support, neither of which was true. By creating these false impressions, Weintraub risked both misleading the public about the FEC\u2019s role and undermining the public\u2019s confidence in the agency.\n\nMore recently, Weintraub has used her position as FEC chair to inject herself and the FEC into the national debate over President Donald Trump\u2019s telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and whether his recent actions violate campaign finance law prohibiting campaigns from soliciting or accepting contributions from foreign nationals. Without explicitly saying that the president violated the foreign national ban, the timing and tone of Weintraub\u2019s public statements unmistakably convey that impression. For example, within hours after ABC News reported that the president had said he would listen to information from foreign nationals about a political opponent, Weintraub tweeted a statement on Commission letterhead about the illegality of campaigns\u2019 accepting contributions from foreign nationals, along with the snarky comment, \u201cI would not have thought that I needed to say this.\u201d She retweeted her statement with a microphone emoji and an even snarkier \u201cIs this thing on?\u201d when the president said China should investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nWhen the U.S. Department of Justice announced it had determined that the president\u2019s call with Zelensky did not violate campaign finance law, Weintraub, acting unilaterally and without conferring with other commissioners, issued a draft interpretive rule arguably implying that Trump\u2019s actions would be illegal. She posted the draft on the FEC\u2019s website and added it to the agenda of an upcoming meeting, even though she knew the FEC, lacking the four members required for a quorum, could not do anything to act on or enforce it. All her actions did was generate publicity for herself and her view of the law. Weintraub also tweeted a link to the draft rule with a message emphasizing the foreign national prohibition\u2019s \u201cbroad scope,\u201d and retweeted it the next day with thick red lines underscoring the relevant language. Weintraub has also appeared on several cable news programs to discuss the foreign national ban.\n\nWhat makes these public statements so concerning is the possibility that this issue might come before Weintraub in an enforcement action. In enforcement actions, commissioners are like judges: We hear complaints alleging that someone violated the law, consider responses from the accused and make a judgement based on the facts presented. And, like judges, commissioners have to be fair and neutral in applying the law to the facts, and decide each case on its own merits. Yet, Weintraub\u2019s statements indicate that she has already made up her mind about the president and his administration\u2014before considering all the facts and deliberating with other commissioners. (For some context, imagine how improper it would be for a judge to go on TV and opine about a high-profile case that could come before him or her in court.) At least one news outlet has interpreted her comments to mean she thought Trump\u2019s actions were illegal. I doubt she demanded a correction to that reading, though she seems to be trying to backtrack from her earlier statements by claiming that she was just explaining the law and not expressing her opinion on how the law applies in this case.\n\nWeintraub\u2019s public statements also risk misleading the public about campaign finance law at a moment when the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Media reports indicate that questions about the foreign national ban might play a role in Congress\u2019s impeachment inquiry. There is no dispute that federal law prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions, donations, expenditures and disbursements in connection with U.S. elections, and prohibits any person from soliciting such contributions or donations from foreign nationals. The FEC has enforced these prohibitions in the civil context for decades, and I stand by my votes in favor of enforcement.\n\nBut Weintraub\u2019s statements create the false impression that the law in this area is clear in all cases when, in fact, it is not. Each case has to be considered on its own specific facts. For example, the FEC concluded in a prior enforcement action that Sir Elton John\u2014a foreign national\u2014could give a free concert to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign without violating the foreign national ban, even though the concert raised millions of dollars for Clinton\u2019s campaign. The FEC also approved political committees\u2019 proposals to accept free coding services and intellectual property rights from foreign nationals, and to allow a foreign national to make speeches at campaign rallies and to solicit candidate contributions. If the FEC ends up considering the legality of the president\u2019s actions, it would have to base its determination on the specific facts presented; to prejudge the result, as Weintraub seems to have done, is irresponsible.\n\nWeintraub\u2019s hostility to other ways of interpreting the law is so extreme that she took the unprecedented step of refusing to allow the FEC to defend itself in court. Recently, a former colleague and I voted to dismiss a complaint against Clinton\u2019s campaign committee and a pro-Clinton super PAC because, among other reasons, the record did not indicate that the two committees had \u201ccoordinated\u201d under applicable law. Weintraub disagreed and wanted to investigate. When her view did not prevail, she threw the entire Commission (and Clinton) under the bus by refusing to allow the FEC to defend our position in court. (At least four commissioners would have had to vote to allow the agency to defend itself. Since we had only four commissioners at the time, the vote had to be unanimous.) When the complainant filed suit against the FEC, the agency was forced to ignore the court\u2019s summons. But Weintraub was not satisfied with merely preventing the FEC from defending itself; she did not want anyone else to defend our position, either. When Clinton tried to intervene in the lawsuit to defend herself and the complainant fought to stop her, Weintraub seemed pleased, tweeting a link to the complainant\u2019s legal brief and calling it \u201cspellbinding reading.\u201d\n\nWeintraub has complained for years that the FEC was dysfunctional when her Republican colleagues disagreed with her legal positions and outvoted her. Now, she is dismissing her colleagues\u2019 views, boasting publicly about her plans to block the agency from defending itself in court whenever she disagrees with its legal position. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has stated that the FEC is \u201cunique among federal administrative agencies\u201d because our \u201csole purpose\u201d is to regulate \u201ccore constitutionally protected activity\u201d\u2014the First Amendment rights of free speech and association in politics. Weintraub\u2019s interpretation of the law doesn\u2019t properly consider the First Amendment\u2014and to make it worse, she\u2019s using radical measures to force her viewpoint.\n\nHer inflammatory public statements and inappropriate tactics risk delegitimizing the FEC by reducing the public\u2019s trust in it to act fairly. While Weintraub is free to speak about any issue she likes in her personal capacity, we commissioners must be circumspect when acting in our official capacities. Instead, Weintraub is using her official position to drag the FEC into political debates in which it does not belong, to promote herself and her personal views of what the law should be, and to mislead the public. In light of her activity, Congress and the president should take a hard look at replacing all three remaining members of the FEC, myself included, and starting fresh with a slate of six new commissioners. No one would blame them if they did.\n\nThis article tagged under: Opinion\n\nElections\n\nFEC", "description": "Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub\u2019s anti-Trump publicity tour is harming the legitimacy of the institution she purports to serve.", "authors": ["Caroline Hunter"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fe/f6/98458fde4aee8407b9b77c192491/191021-weintraub-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
