Veterinarian Charles Bruce says Mango should recover well after surgery for a broken leg.

We love him, but he was a busy boy,\" she said. \"He has destroyed our lawn. He loves to root [in the dirt]. He loves to play. He'll play with dog toys, he'll find treasures in the recycling bin, and he loves to eat \u2014 he's quite an active participant in our kitchen activities.\"\n\nHe's smart, too: da Costa said Mango was trained to go outside for bathroom breaks within about a week.\n\nNo one is sure how Mango the Pig ended up on Highway 417. But he was bloodied and terrified when motorist Julia Wykes scooped him up off the asphalt. And now, that day may have been the best thing to happen to Mango's life. 6:20\n\nMango moves Friday to the non-profit Penny Lane Farm Sanctuary east of Rockland, Ont., currently home to four other pigs and about 70 other rescued farm animals, where he's expected to grow to his adult weight of about 360 kilos.", "description": "Mango the lucky little pig on the mend and heading to his forever home, an animal sanctuary east of Ottawa.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322681.1571240068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mango-pig-ottawa-rescue.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
