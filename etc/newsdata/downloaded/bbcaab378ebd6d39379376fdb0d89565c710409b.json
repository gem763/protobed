Kamala Harris (D-CA) cited the Twitter blacklisting of actor James Woods in her letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Tuesday, in which she demanded that President Donald Trump be kicked off the social media platform.\n\nThe Democratic presidential hopeful fired off a letter to Dorsey in which she inaccurately accused Trump of violating Twitter\u2019s terms of service.\n\nIn the letter, Harris invoked Woods, a rare Hollywood conservative and Trump supporter who was blacklisted from Twitter in April. The actor claimed the platform removed a tweet he refused to take down and swore to no longer use the social media platform.\n\nHarris alleged that Woods used Twitter \u201cto harass and spread hateful messages,\u201d without citing evidence of harassment. Twitter\u2019s terms of service make no mention of \u201chateful\u201d content.\n\nThe presidential candidate also invoked Martin Shkreli, the convicted hedge fund manager who is was permanently kicked off Twitter in 2017.\n\nHarris\u2019 demand came after Trump tweeted that he believes impeachment efforts are actually \u201ca coup\u201d intended to nullify the power of the American people.\n\n\u201cHey @jack. Time to do something about this,\u201d Harris tweeted in response to the president.\n\nMany prominent media figures criticized Harris\u2019 letter as an attempt to crush the freedom of speech protected under the First Amendment. One such figure was Nate Silver, the founder the left-leaning news site FiveThirtyEight.\n\n\u201cHey, @jack. As a journalist I think Trump\u2019s tweets are extremely newsworthy and I\u2019m happy that you\u2019ve given the President of the United States a platform to communicate in a direct and unfiltered way with the public,\u201d Silver tweeted.\n\nHey, @jack.
