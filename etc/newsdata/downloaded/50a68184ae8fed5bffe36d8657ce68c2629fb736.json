Consulting my map, I write the following numbers on something approximating a waxed luggage tag: \u201c22-37-71-34-33-32-31-30-08-01-33\u201d. I put the map away, slip the tag around my bike\u2019s handlebars and I\u2019m set for the morning. I\u2019ve never been to this part of Flanders before \u2013 it\u2019s the lesser-known French part, on the northernmost tip of the country, bordering Belgium \u2013 but I\u2019m now confident I can cycle today from my table in the riverside town of Saint-Venant, through Haverskerque, across the Nieppe forest, down into Merville and finally into the town of Estaires.\n\nWelcome to French Flanders\u2019 ingenious new cycle network. Launched earlier this year, the catchily titled R\u00e9seau Points-N\u0153uds V\u00e9lo (literally Network Node-Points Bike) comprises 830km of minor roads and cycle paths covering the Vall\u00e9e de la Lys, the Monts de Flandre hills and a small slice of southern Belgium. The clever bit is its hundreds of numbered signposts \u2013 or \u201cnode-points\u201d \u2013 each directing cyclists to the next numbered signpost. All riders need to do is pick up the map (\u20ac8), note down the node-point numbers on their chosen route and pedal away. The map also highlights restaurants, breweries, museums, attractions, campsites and eco-lodges, and shows the distances between the node-points, which makes tailoring your own Tour de Flandre extremely simple. And once you\u2019ve set off, there\u2019s no need to consult the map again, or worry about your phone dying.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Node point north of Estaires\n\nLess than three hours after setting off from London, I picked up my hire bike (eeuwenhout.info) at Bailleul, one of the many small towns and villages within the network served by a railway station. On my three-day circular tour I would cover 180km, starting with a gentle climb into the low hills of the Monts de Flandre.\n\nIt was lunchtime when I rolled into Terdeghem, a village of neat brick cottages and the Het Kerk Hoek, holder of the much-prized Estaminets flamands marque, awarded to authentically Flemish restaurants and bars. I think it\u2019s fairly safe to say that, like the rest of Flanders \u2013 which loves its beef, chicken, mussels and cheeses \u2013 it has yet to receive the memo about veganism. However, it\u2019s wonderful how far cow eyes and a sad inflection in the voice will get you. In no time, I was tucking into a beautiful platter of locally grown crudit\u00e9s, complete with little pots of dressings, sauces and a comp\u00f4te, along with a 3 Monts beer. \u201cBrewed just 3km from here,\u201d according to the barman.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lots of bottle \u2026 Bellenaert brewery in Outtersteene\n\nIt was the first of many Flemish beers I sampled. At the Bellenaert eco-brewery in Outtersteene, where all the energy comes from renewables, I learned a little about the nuances of bitterness, density and colour. Flemish beers are usually fermented a second time in the bottle, which gives them a delicate crispness.\n\nI also discovered that the Flemish have a sceptical attitude to Mondays, and opening hours in general \u2013 my attempts to visit the museums dedicated to life on the French/Belgian border and bees were rebuffed by mus\u00e9e ferm\u00e9 signs. However, I had more luck when I breezed along the few kilometres (\u201c59-23-27-22-33\u201d) from Terdeghem to Cassel.\n\nPerched on the saddle between two hills, and sprinkled with gorgeous Flemish architecture, Cassel is said to be the inspiration for the nursery rhyme The Grand Old Duke of York, and was voted France\u2019s favourite village in a TV competition last year. On the beautiful old Grand\u2019Place I popped into the Mus\u00e9e de Flandre to unearth something of the region\u2019s history. It was rather bloody: the area was fought over by Burgundians, Dutch, Spanish, French and Germans (though not all at once). However, its people did inspire Pieter Bruegel the Elder, so there\u2019s that.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Where there\u2019s muck \u2026 the brass band competition in Cassel\n\nI was just about to leave when I heard Harpo\u2019s 1975 smash, Movie Star, being played outside by a marching band, striding over the cobbles. And then came another. And another. I had stumbled upon a competition \u2013 six brass bands from local villages taking turns to roam around Cassel\u2019s Grand\u2019Place blasting out three-minute renditions of popular classics, from Abba and Aha to the White Stripes and, well, AC/DC. Until you\u2019ve heard Highway to Hell played by 30 mild-mannered, uniformed village folk, you cannot truly claim to have lived.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The elegant gi\u0302te in Tilleul. Photograph: Dixe Wills\n\nMy days rolled away as I bowled languorously along quiet back roads. This is farming country: the path alongside the River Lys from Thiennes to Haverskerque made for a pleasant off-road stretch, while the track through the Nieppe forest provided a sylvan interlude.\n\nAccommodation in the region is plentiful: I spent my first night in a Cabane Rando, a rustic wooden pod the shape of an A-frame tent (\u20ac25 single occupancy, \u20ac46 double); my second in what looked like a charming folly converted into an elegant little g\u00eete (sleeps 4 from \u20ac110), where I listened to a pair of owls calling back and forth across the woodland garden; and my final night in Flandre Lys eco-lodge (sleeps 4, \u20ac36) at a fetching little pleasure boat marina on the Lys, where my thrillingly lofty bedroom was reached by a ladder.\n\nOver the next two years, the network will expand north to Dunkirk, and one would hope that it\u2019s only a matter of time before this brilliantly simple idea makes the leap across the Channel. For this surely is the future of cycle touring: the days of the old-school map are numbered.\n\n\u2022 The trip was provided by Nord Tourisme (jadorelenord.fr, in French only), which sells the R\u00e9seau Points-N\u0153uds V\u00e9lo map (\u20ac8); it\u2019s also available from tourist information centres. Rail tickets were supplied by Rail Europe: London-Lille from \u00a358 return; Lille-Bailleul \u20ac14.40 return. Bicycle hire at Bailleul was provided by Eeuwenhout (eeuwenhout.info, Dutch only), which can deliver to the station: electric bicycle \u20ac30 a day/ \u20ac175 a week\n\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?
