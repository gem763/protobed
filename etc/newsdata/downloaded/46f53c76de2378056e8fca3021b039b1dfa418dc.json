DBS\n\nWhen it comes to winning international accolades, Singapore\u2019s DBS seems to be on a roll.\n\nMost recently, the bank\u2019s CEO, Piyush Gupta, was on October 22 named one of the world\u2019s top 100 best-performing chief executive officers by the Harvard Business Review (HBR).\n\nRanked at 89th spot, Gupta was also the only CEO from South-east Asia to make the list, and ranked above Japanese conglomerate SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son.\n\nAccording to DBS chairman Peter Seah, Gupta is also the first Singapore CEO to be featured on HBR\u2019s annual list.\n\nGupta, who was born in India and became a Singaporean in 2009, has been DBS Bank\u2019s CEO for 10 years.\n\n\u201cIt is a honour to be included in HBR\u2019s CEO 100 list and I am humbled by the recognition,\u201d Gupta said in a statement.\n\nRead also: The 35 best CEOs in the world, according to Harvard Business Review\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very fortunate at DBS to be supported by a board with great faith in our ability to become the world\u2019s best, and to be the beneficiary of incredible teamwork and commitment from my colleagues,\u201d he said.\n\nHBR said in a statement that its CEO 100 list differs from other performance rankings as it measures performance for the entire length of a chief executive\u2019s tenure.\n\n\u201cThe leaders on our 2019 list have prospered by outperforming their peers over the long term \u2013 both financially and on increasingly important environmental, social, and governance measures,\u201d HBR\u2019s editor-in-chief Adi Ignatius said.\n\nOnly CEOs on the S&P Global 1200 who have been on the job for at least two years were considered. The list was then compiled based on overall shareholder return and increase in market capitalisation over the CEOs\u2019 entire tenure. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance ratings provided by CSRHub and Sustainalytics were also factored in.\n\nDue to heavier ESG weighting in the 2019 list, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos \u2013 who had been in first place since 2014 \u2013 fell off the list completely, HBR said.\n\nJensen Huang, CEO of American company NVIDIA, moved up to first place from second spot last year. Following at second and third place were Salesforce\u2019s Marc Benioff and Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault of Kering.\n\nGupta\u2019s ranking comes less than two weeks after DBS won the world\u2019s best SME bank award by Global Finance.\n\nIn September, HBR had also listed DBS on its list of the world\u2019s top 10 companies with the most successful strategic transformations in the last decade. That same month, it was also one of five Singapore companies recognised on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.\n\nDBS was also named the World\u2019s Best Bank by Euromoney earlier this year, after winning the same title from Global Finance and The Banker in 2018.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Gupta is also the first Singapore CEO to be featured on HBR's annual list, DBS said..
