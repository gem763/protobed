Raslan is being prosecuted in Germany, but not for any crimes committed in the country, nor against its nationals. Instead, he is being subject to a principle in international law known as universal jurisdiction. Germany and a small handful of other European countries have decided that when it comes to certain crimes, the notion of jurisdiction\u2014that a government or authority can prosecute only crimes committed within its own borders\u2014does not always apply.\n\nRead: How the idea of national sovereignty is\u2014and isn\u2019t\u2014changing\n\nIn effect, Berlin is saying its prosecutors can bring charges against anyone alleged to have committed crimes against humanity, genocide, or war crimes anywhere in the world, against any other nation\u2019s people.\n\n\u201cIt is a surprise for everyone,\u201d Anwar al-Bunni, a Syrian lawyer living in Berlin and a witness in the case against Raslan, said. Bunni, who recalls ending up at the same refugee center in Berlin as Raslan, continued: \u201cNobody could imagine that universal jurisdiction could work.\u201d\n\nThe Raslan case is one of several that German authorities\u2014led by a combination of the federal prosecutor\u2019s office, with 11 dedicated staff members, and a specialized police war-crimes unit, with 17 people\u2014are pursuing that extend beyond their borders. Because Germany doesn\u2019t normally announce whom it has warrants out for until an arrest is made, it is unclear precisely how many such efforts are under way. In a December 2018 report for a German trade journal, the federal prosecutor Christian Ritscher, who heads the office responsible for war crimes, said there were 80 open inquiries related to international criminal law, of which about half had to do with Iraq and Syria, with 10 arrest warrants outstanding. Ritscher said his office had also received hundreds more referrals for potential cases that year alone. (Both the federal prosecutor\u2019s office and the police war-crimes unit declined requests for comment.)\n\nPrevious attempts have foundered on political sensitivities, unwilling prosecutors, and a lack of evidence, witnesses, or resources. But that has been changing: The number of so-called named suspects in cases that rely on some facet of universal jurisdiction increased by 18 percent last year compared with 2017, according to Trial International, and cases similar to Raslan\u2019s are under way in Austria, France, and Sweden.\n\nThe overall impact of such efforts is significant\u2014what prosecutors are doing here in Europe may eventually change the way war criminals the world over are prosecuted. It is, according to the international criminal-law expert and Stanford professor Beth Van Schaack, \u201ca sign of the development of a new system of international justice that is more integrated and coordinated than ever before.\u201d", "description": "German officials are using the concept of universal jurisdiction to argue they can try anyone for war crimes committed anywhere, against any nation's people.", "authors": ["Cathrin Schaer"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/RTX3GYDG/facebook.jpg?1564572846", "published_at": "2019-07-31"}
