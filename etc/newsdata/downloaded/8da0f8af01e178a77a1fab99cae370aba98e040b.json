Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.\n\nTOM HOMAN SAYS HE WARNED FLORES AGREEMENT WOULD LEAD TO SURGE IN FAMILY UNITS AT BORDER\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to really make sure that the jingoistic, bigoted testimony of Mr. Homan is called out as nearly completely untrue, as being an outrage, and as a former official directing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, he should know better,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat did I say was inaccurate?\u201d Homan shot back, as Chairman Jamie Raskin, D-Md., intervened to restore order.\n\nCONDI RICE SHUTS DOWN NBC ANCHOR ON RUSSIAN ELECTION INTERFERENCE\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s important that it\u2019s not accepted as accurate testimony,\u201d she said. She went on to question other witnesses on the panel, but did not ask anything of Homan.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., told Homan he will be remembered as \"ruthless and inhumane\" toward asylum-seekers, while Homan also battled Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.N.Y., and called on lawmakers to instead change the laws they don't like that ICE and other agencies are enforcing.\n\nHost Katie Pavlich said Democrats seem to have \"forgotten conveniently\" that Homan served in the Obama administration, and many of the problems at the border date back to 2014.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Instead of coming back with some kind of argument, [Wasserman Schultz] just tried to move on and say his testimony should not be accepted,\" she said.\n\nHost Brian Kilmeade said Democrats are not used to someone pushing back with facts on their anti-Trump rhetoric about the border.\n\n\"Can you imagine someone sitting in front of you and saying 'your bigoted policies' and start ripping you apart and expect you to just turn your microphone off and move on? She called him a bigot!\" he said.\n\nFox News' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Acting ICE Director\u00a0Tom Homan\u00a0faced personal attacks from House Democrats at a congressional hearing and the hosts of \"Fox & Friends\" recapped the fiery clashes on Thursday morning.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/split.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
