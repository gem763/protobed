S. Attorney John Dominguez,made clear in his communications with Edmond that any request for a specific sentence reduction needed the agreement of Dominguez\u2019s supervisors. They said that never happened. One person said that at least one document suggested a final decision had been made.\n\nOne of those documents was sent in recent years. It was not clear when the others were sent.\n\nWhat prosecutors ultimately requested was a less significant reduction to Edmond\u2019s term of life without parole. This month, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office filed a motion asking a federal judge to change that punishment to 40 years.\n\nThe question of whether Edmond was told his help to prosecutors would result in a much-bigger benefit is likely to be a key issue during an October hearing in the case. The final say on whether Edmond gets a break belongs to U.S. District Judge Emmet G. \u00adSullivan.\n\nEdmond, 54, has been incarcerated for three decades. Authorities say he oversaw an operation that brought as much as 1,700 pounds of cocaine a month into the District in the mid-1980s. At one point, law enforcement officials estimated that he was taking in as much as $2 million a week.\n\n\n\nRayful Edmond III\n\nIn February, prosecutors shocked District residents when they said they would seek a reduction in Edmond\u2019s prison time because he had cooperated with authorities over two decades, helping them understand the workings of the drug trade and convict about 100 other dealers.\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office said last week that it had not previously made an official agreement with Edmond.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware of any promises that John Dominguez made,\u201d said Kadia Koroma, a spokeswoman for the office. \u201cThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office has never taken a position of time served.\u201d\n\nDominquez, a 35-year prosecutor with the office, did not return telephone calls.\n\nJason G. Downs, Edmond\u2019s attorney, also declined to comment. Downs has repeatedly argued that Edmond should be released because of his cooperation and the time he has spent in prison. During a May hearing in front of Sullivan, Downs said he planned to call Dominguez as a witness to testify on behalf of Edmond at the resentencing hearing scheduled to begin Oct. 16.\n\nJohn Crabb, the new lead prosecutor appointed to Edmond\u2019s case, objected to having Dominguez testify. Then, on Sept. 4, Downs filed a motion with the court informing the judge that he had subpoenaed Dominguez to appear at the hearing.\n\n[Rayful Edmond III appears at first hearing for early release from prison, via video conference]\n\nIf Dominguez testifies, details about the inner workings of the U.S. attorney\u2019s office and what he offered Edmond as part of his cooperation agreement could be revealed.\n\nAt the time of his arrest and trial, authorities said Edmond\u2019s drug ring helped fuel a crack cocaine epidemic that contributed to the city\u2019s rising homicide rate at the time, pushing Washington to be nicknamed the \u201cnation\u2019s murder capital.\u201d Authorities said Edmond\u2019s enforcers were linked to as many as 30 slayings, although Edmond was never convicted in any homicides.\n\nWhatever decision Sullivan makes will not directly affect a separate 30-year sentence Edmond has yet to serve for dealing drugs from a Pennsylvania prison.\n\nIn an interview with The Post, David J. Freed, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, said his office has not decided whether it, too, would grant Edmond a reduction. Instead, Freed said, his office was waiting to see how Sullivan rules.\n\nRead more:\n\nWith a letter of support from Kim Kardashian-West, D.C. man convicted of murder gets a second chance\n\nIn court, D.C. man disavows his white-nationalist views and \u2018darkest corners\u2019 of social media\n\nBefore he died in prison, prosecutors were trying to cut down his 40-year prison sentence\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The government instead recommended that the drug kingpin\u2019s life term be reduced to 40 years.", "authors": ["Keith L.
