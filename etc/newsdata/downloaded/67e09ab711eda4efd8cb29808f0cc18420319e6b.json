Now it just needs to get its water business back to tip-top health amid a barrage of new entrants.\n\n\u201cOur performance in the water category has not been as strong as we'd like. We're working on further plans to address this in the marketplace in the near future,\u201d Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey told analysts on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call this month.\n\nQuincey is right to call out the core water business \u2014 which is led by brands Dasani, Smartwater and Topo Chico \u2014 as in need of improvement.\n\nUnit case volume \u2014 a key performance measure for beverage companies \u2014 in Coke\u2019s North America water, enhanced water and sports drink business only rose 1% in the third quarter. The overall business, which Coke refers to as \u201chydration\u201d and also includes VitaminWater and Powerade, has seen volume relatively flat for the nine months ended Sept. 27.\n\nFor perspective, unit volume for trademark Coke products rose a solid 2% in the third quarter. Over at Coke rival PepsiCo (PEP), sales of bottled waters such as LIFEWTR and Propel surged by double-digits in the third quarter. PepsiCo executives added on its earnings call that its new bubly sparkling beverage continued to \u201cpost very strong growth and is gaining share in the flavored sparkling water category aided by packaging and flavor innovation.\u201d\n\nCoke\u2019s water business has lagged for most of the year, with the likes of Propel benefiting from aggressive marketing of new waters with flavors and electrolytes. Meanwhile, boxed waters from upstart beverage makers have finally started to take hold at retail. The supermarket aisles have also been overrun with water drinks offering various health promises and interesting flavors.\n\nFlat water business\n\nSales of Coke\u2019s water business have been flat this year, according to data from Nielsen. The total bottled water business in the U.S. (still and sparkling) is up about 5% to $12.8 billion, per Nielsen.\n\nNielsen data estimates Coke has about a 14% market share of the U.S. water business. Coke\u2019s water business sports the second highest gross profit margin in its beverage portfolio, behind sparkling beverages and ahead of coffee and tea, according to data from Coke. The business in North America is its third largest as a percentage of revenue behind sparkling beverages and juice, dairy and plant-based drinks.\n\nSo, it would behoove Coke to right the ship in water so to speak. A Coke spokesperson declined to share the company\u2019s plan of attack to alter the course of its water sales. But experts point to Coke moving more aggressively on two fronts that are already in motion.\n\nIn this Thursday, March 16, 2017, photo, bottles of Lifewtr and Smartwater are displayed in Philadelphia. As bottled water surges in popularity, Coke, Pepsi and other companies are using celebrity endorsements, stylish packaging and fancy filtration processes like \u201creverse osmosis\u201d to sell people on expanding variations of what comes out of the tap. They\u2019re also adding flourishes like bubbles, flavors or sweeteners that can blur the lines between what is water and what is soda. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) More\n\nThe first is to \u201cpremiumize\u201d its water portfolio, adding variations of core Smartwater that suit different consumer needs along with flavored sparkling beverages. For instance, Smartwater is currently hawking three new water formulas besides the original: waters with antioxidants, alkalines and sparkling. Dasani has introduced slim cans and bottles of flavored sparkling waters.\n\nThe other aspect will center on moving away from plastic bottles altogether and into aluminum cans to play to health minded, conservationists. The Dasani brand has a goal to remove about 1 billion of virgin PET plastic bottles from the supply chain over the next five years. Moving into recyclable, reusable packaging should also help the margins of the water business even with volume challenges.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how long before Coke\u2019s water business does turnaround even in the face of these efforts.\n\n\u201cThe algorithm will get better over time as SmartWater/Topo Chico and a new flavored sparkling [water] will come at a premium price but volume will still be challenged as they will not push as much Dasani (less profitable),\u201d veteran beverage analyst Laurent Grandet at Guggenheim Securities tells Yahoo Finance.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
