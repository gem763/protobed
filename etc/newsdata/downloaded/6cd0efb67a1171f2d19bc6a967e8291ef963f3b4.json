But the party toughened the qualifying criteria to winnow the field and give a bigger spotlight to the top candidates.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s a great opportunity to advance,\u201d Buttigieg told reporters in New Hampshire last weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s still 10 at a time, but now we at least know looking at that stage that the nominee will emerge from that group.\u201d\n\nThe first two rounds of debates have been contentious. Biden came under repeated attacks led by Harris and Booker for his record on race and criminal justice reform and his views on healthcare.\n\nWarren and Sanders, old allies who have promised not to criticize each other, teamed up during the second round of debates in Detroit to defend their progressive agenda when attacked by more moderate candidates.\n\nBut this time, Warren could be a bigger target for criticism - and have more incentive to criticize Biden. A steady rise in opinion polls over the past two months has moved her ahead of Sanders into second place nationally in the Real Clear Politics polling average.\n\nWarren and Biden have tangled before. She challenged him more than a decade ago when she was a law professor over his support for a bill to make it harder to declare bankruptcy for personal debts. Biden represented Delaware, home to several large credit card companies, in the U.S. Senate.\n\nBiden has held his front-runner status in opinion polls since he entered the Democratic nominating race in April, with Warren and Sanders battling for second behind him. None of the other contenders reaches double digits in most polls at this point.\n\nDemocratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks at the New Hampshire Democratic Party state convention in Manchester, New Hampshire, U.S. September 7, 2019.

It\u2019s simple math,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sharp bickering during the first two rounds of the debates dismayed some Democrats, who have urged the candidates to rein in their attacks and focus on laying out their own affirmative agendas.\n\n\u201cA lot of us have talked to the candidates directly, and I think you are going to see people really offering a vision,\u201d said Ray Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire state party. \u201cRight now, this country does not need to hear about Democrats squabbling.\u201d\n\nAlso participating in the debate in Houston will be U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former U.S. Housing Secretary Julian Castro, former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nCastro, also the former mayor of San Antonio, and O\u2019Rourke are both from Texas, which will vote on Super Tuesday early in the nominating schedule next year.\n\nThe Houston debate, to be televised by ABC News, is scheduled to last for up to three hours.\n\n\u201cThis is a great opportunity for me. We\u2019ll have more people watching because it\u2019s just one night,\u201d Klobuchar told reporters.\n\nDemocratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign town hall meeting in Laconia, New Hampshire, U.S., September 6, 2019.
