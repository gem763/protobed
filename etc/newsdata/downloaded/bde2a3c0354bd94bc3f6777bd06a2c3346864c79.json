The couple has requested that the judge either waive their financial liability or adjust it to the boat\u2019s post-fire value \u2015 in this case, $0.\n\nThe law was most famously used by the shipping company White Star Lines after the 1912 Titanic disaster during which more than 1,500 passengers were killed on the ship\u2019s maiden voyage. In that instance, the company\u2019s liability was evaluated at $92,000, which equaled the worth of the surviving lifeboats.\n\nIn the early hours of Monday morning, a Conception crew member made a mayday call announcing that the 75-foot vessel had caught fire near Santa Cruz Island. Five of the six crew members jumped ship and survived, but the remaining crew member and 33 passengers who died were trapped below deck with no way out.\n\nAs of Wednesday, all but one of the bodies had been found and recovered.\n\nLocal, state and federal authorities are still investigating what happened, though an early investigation uncovered safety lapses, law enforcement sources told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAccording to the AP, a non-jury trial will be held to determine whether Truth Aquatics can prove it wasn\u2019t to blame for the fire. If it is successful in doing so, claimants will not be entitled to any financial restitution.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article mistakenly stated the Conception caught fire near Santa Cruz, and that four out of five crew members made it off the boat. The accident occurred near Santa Cruz Island, and five out of the six-person crew escaped.", "description": "Glen and Dana Fritzler of Truth Aquatics are basing their case on the law used by the company that operated the Titanic.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7277f42300004e005125f5.jpeg?cache=qdqila35ok&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
