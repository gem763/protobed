This is a disgusting smear. Are there people who are using Hunter's past business dealings in bad faith to damage him? Sure! But branding anybody who dares question the holy Vice President's motives and that of his family as a Nazi is the lowest of low blows.\n\nWorse the media is covering for him. They are united in their total and complete belief that there is absolutely nothing to see here at all to see when it comes to Hunter's past business dealings and its intersection with Biden's own Vice Presidency. Just look at the words that The New York Times uses in its own story about Biden's speech.\n\n\"There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China, the other country Mr. Trump was alluding to in his tweet.\" That is an incredible statement, given that The New York Times own reporting confirms that Hunter was paid $50,000 a month by the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Furthermore, you all may remember my monologue from last week detailing the connections between Hunter and Joe Biden.\n\nWell guess where I got all that information? The New York Times people!\n\nTo recap that case Hunter accompanied his father on a 2013 trip to Beijing catching a ride on Air Force 2. Days later a private equity firm called BHR Equity Investments raised $1 billion, later raised to $1.5 billion, in funding from the Chinese government. The company's largest shareholder is literally the bank of China. Hunter at the time sat on the board of BHR Holdings.\n\nWhile in China, Joe Biden shook hands with the future CEO of BHR Holdings and he also met with Hunter Biden on a so called \"social call.\" Hunter by his own admission continues to own 10% of the company, even though he assures us all he's yet to make any money for it?\n\nWhat the hell is The New York Times talking about? There is evidence in their own paper I just laid out that Hunter Biden made untold sums profiting off his father's Vice Presidency. Is there any evidence that his father intervened solely for the purpose of saving his son's company from his investigation? No there isn't, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s called a conflict of interest and why ethical people avoid them. To spare even the question.\n\nEven worse, Biden's Democratic opponents are covering for him.

Why is the paper of so called record putting unfounded claims to borrow, from their language, of defense for Biden which are easily proven false by their own reporting. The answer is that Donald Trump will be the undoing of both the media and the Democrats if they continue down this path.\n\nAnd by the way? Thats what nazism actually looked like. Having a message pushed by powerful people with a lot to lose and the media gobbling it up in order to preserve their status with the powerful.\n\nThe media and the Democrats, they hate Trump so much that if he says something with a grain of truth, it becomes their job in life to gaslight the American public to believe he is lying. The thing is, though, is that Trump says things which aren't true all the time. They could stick to just those and have enough for a lifetime, but they just can't resist and it leads to gaslighting like this.", "description": "Opinion by: Saagar EnjetiFormer Vice President Joe Biden came out swinging yesterday, or I guess his version of it, in his strongest worded statement to date calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bidenjoe_100219getty_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
