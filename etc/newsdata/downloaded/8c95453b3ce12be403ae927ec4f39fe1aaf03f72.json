It has attracted contributions from individuals, philanthropies and automotive companies, including Gordy\u2019s long-ago employer Ford Motor Co. Gordy has long said the auto industry served as the inspiration for what would become an assembly line of record-making.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the future of Motown Museum and happy to support it,\u201d Gordy said in a release. \u201cNot only will the expanded museum entertain and tell the stories of talented and creative people who succeeded against all odds, but it will also inspire and create opportunity for people to explore their dreams the way I did mine. I couldn\u2019t be prouder to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nGordy launched Motown in 1959, moved the label to Los Angeles in 1972 and sold it in 1988. His late sister, Esther Gordy Edwards, founded the museum in the former \u201cHitsville U.S.A.\u201d headquarters on West Grand Boulevard in 1985. When Edwards died in 2011, Gordy - who has previously donated properties, artifacts and money to the museum - credited her with turning \u201cthe so-called trash left behind \u2026 into a phenomenal world-class monument at the spot where Hitsville started.\u201d\n\nMuseum expansion plans include interactive exhibits, a performance theater, recording studios, an expanded retail area and meeting spaces. Museum officials say they are not releasing fundraising totals.\n\nRobin Terry, Motown Museum CEO and Gordy\u2019s grand-niece, said in the release that his donation \u201cadvances our vision of making the expanded museum a world class entertainment and educational destination that will ensure the inspiration of Motown lives on for generations to come.\u201d\n\nMotown\u2019s roster of artists from the Detroit era included The Supremes, the Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, the Jackson 5, the Four Tops and Temptations.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jeff Karoub on Twitter: https://twitter.com/jeffkaroub\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Motown Records founder Berry Gordy Jr. is donating $4 million toward a project to expand a museum housed in the Detroit building where he built his music empire, officials announced Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jeff Karoub"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/motown_museum_berry_gordy_35538_c0-189-4518-2823_s1770x1032.jpg?d0b78c32db89f0d55196d138458e4badcf9e5a5b"}
