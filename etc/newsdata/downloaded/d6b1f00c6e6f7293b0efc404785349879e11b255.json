Shop Direct, which has been hit by \u00a3550m of misselling claims, said: 'We expect funding to be in place shortly. The business continues to trade well.'\n\nIt comes as Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay, 85, gear up to sell their empire, which includes the Ritz Hotel and the Telegraph newspaper. They made an \u00a38bn fortune after starting out in the 1970s converting London boarding houses to hotels.\n\nThey are said to be considering bids for Telegraph Media Group, courier service Yodel and the Ritz, which would have a price tag of \u00a3800m.\n\nAdvisers have not been hired for Shop Direct, it is understood, and the brothers are said to be 'keen to keep their stake' in the online retailer.", "description": "Deloitte said there was 'material uncertainty' as to whether it can continue operating after a cash injection to plug a gap caused by a massive PPI bill was delayed.", "authors": ["City", "Finance Reporter For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
