It\u2019s been made very clear that this is moving forward,\u201d said Toot Wolff, principal of world champions Mercedes.\n\n\u201cThere will be tweaks and changes in detail and interpretations but broadly I think this is moving forward.\u201d\n\nThe 2021 sporting and technical regulations are due to be published next week.\n\n\u201cI think with hindsight we would have been better bringing the cap in first for 2021 and then taking more time to develop these regulations and evolve them and bring them in for 2022, so that any development the big teams undertake would be under the umbrella of the cap,\u201d said Horner.\n\nWolff said there had been an argument to bring the cost cap forward to next year and implement the technical and sporting regulations in 2021, but that was not an option.\n\n\u201cThe single most important factor is the auditing and policing process and none of that is in place for 2020,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd obviously if you can\u2019t police it in the right way, it makes no sense to implement the rule.\u201d\n\nWolff said pushing the introduction of the rule changes back a year was more logical but the idea \u201cdidn\u2019t gain the traction and didn\u2019t trigger enough appetite with the ones that decide.\u201d\n\nFormula One\u2019s commercial rights holders Liberty Media and the governing FIA are keen to level the playing field and reduce costs to make the racing more competitive.\n\nSome teams, such as McLaren, are keen to stick to the proposed timetable.\n\n\u201cWe like what is on the table now, what we have seen last week also, in terms of what\u2019s coming in on the technical side, the sporting side and on the financial side,\u201d said team boss Andreas Seidl.", "description": "Leading teams wanted Formula One to delay a major revamp of the rules by a year until 2022 after introducing a cost cap in 2021 but see little chance of that happening now, bosses said on Friday.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445040519&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P01E", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
