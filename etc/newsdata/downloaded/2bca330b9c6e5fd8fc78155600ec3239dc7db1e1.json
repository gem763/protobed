Not according to The Situation.\n\n\u2018He would say \u201chi,\u201d but he wasn\u2019t in my group of friends,\u2019 Mike told his Jersey Shore co-star Snooki on the It\u2019s Happening With Snooki and Joey podcast, adding that he\u2019d \u2018played against him in basketball and softball maybe\u2019.\n\nHowever Billy is said to have found himself in trouble after sneaking in contraband items, getting himself thrown into solitary confinement, or the SHU (Solitary Housing Unit).\n\nBilly with rapper Ja Rule in Netflix\u2019s FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened (Picture: Netflix)\n\nIf we\u2019ve learnt anything from Orange Is The New Black, it\u2019s that that is not a place you want to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He supposedly smuggled in some sort of recording device, and he was caught with it,\u2019 The Situation speculated.\n\n\u2018They said he was trying to record high-profile inmates and they threw him in the SHU. They sent him to a worse prison, I think, recently. That\u2019s a bonehead move right there.\u2019\n\nYou\u2019re telling us.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t even know why you\u2019d be trying to record in there,\u2019 Mike said, theorising: \u2018Maybe he was trying to write a book.\u2019\n\nWell, given that Billy is currently 18 months into a six-year sentence for his role orchestrating the influencer festival car crash that was Fyre Festival, we suspect that we might have to wait a while for his memoirs to be released.\n\nStill, is it bad to admit that we would actually read it?\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
