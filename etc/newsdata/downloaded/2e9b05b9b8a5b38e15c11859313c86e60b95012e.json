I got a hammer and smashed it all around.\n\n\u2018I hoped I didn\u2019t hit his head obviously, but I knew I didn\u2019t have much choice as we didn\u2019t have long.\u2019\n\nCharlie was sedated and the vase released (Picture: Kennedy News)\n\nDebbie took him to Abbey Green Vets and once she knew he would be OK, she took a picture.\n\n\u2018Now I know he\u2019s alright I think it\u2019s quite funny but at the time it wasn\u2019t.\u2019\n\nDebbie said that the urn incident was not the first time that Charlie had caused havoc.\n\nShe said: \u2018I think he must have nine lives because he\u2019s also chewed the cable lamp while it was on. I call him \u201cCheeky Charlie\u201d.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s absolutely fine now. He was very quiet the next day but now he\u2019s back to normal.\u2019\n\nAbbey Green Vets said his arrival on Monday \u2018brightened their morning.\u2019", "description": "This mischievous puppy got more than he bargained for when he stuck his head in a giant urn.
