Let\u2019s see. Loving the view though...Allah always in control.'\n\n(Image: paulpogba/Instagram)\n\nThe post certainly seemed to draw a positive response online, with one user commenting: \"We need u (sic) badly.\"\n\nAnother, meanwhile, added: \"Comeback (sic) stronger brother.\"\n\nUnited could certainly do with Pogba coming back stronger to help lift Solskjaer's men after a poor start to the new season.\n\n(Image: paulpogba/Instagram)\n\nFollowing the defeat at Newcastle on Sunday, the Premier League giants sit just two points clear of the bottom four in 12th after eight games.\n\nAnd with a trip to fierce rivals Liverpool to come after the international break, things certainly won't get any easier for the Old Trafford.", "description": "The World Cup winner has missed United's last two games, but appears to be nearing a return and is stepping up his recovery", "authors": ["Ned Keating", "Image", "Paulpogba Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529378.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_LCP_CHP_071019PogbaWorkout_2634PogbaWorkoutJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
