Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, inked a similar bill this spring. Vermont Governor Phil Scott, a Republican, did so last year. And members of Congress from both parties support importation.\n\nThe United States has one of the safest drug markets in the world. Thanks to rigorous FDA oversight, American patients can trust the quality of their drugs. The FDA makes pharmaceutical companies prove the safety and efficacy of every drug in various tests, including multiple clinical trials. That's why it often takes up to 15 years to bring a single medicine from the lab to pharmacy shelves.\n\nMost foreign governments don't have such high standards. As a result, their drug markets are riddled with unsafe counterfeit products. Indeed, one in 10 drugs sold in developing nations is either fake or substandard. That makes the counterfeit drug trade a $30 billion business.\n\nThe majority of fake drugs contain few, if any, active ingredients. Counterfeiters take common household items like cornstarch and chalk and pass them off as everything from antibiotics to cancer drugs. Patients taking these knockoff drugs are initially none the wiser -- but they soon grow sicker as the medicines fail to work.\n\nOther counterfeit drugs are far more dangerous. FDA and World Health Organization investigations have found fake medicines to contain lethal substances including rat poison, paint thinner, and antifreeze. The WHO estimates that counterfeit drugs kill tens of thousands of people every year.\n\nSupporters of drug importation claim patients can trust the quality of drugs imported from a developed nation like Canada. They're mistaken.\n\nIn 2018, U.S. prosecutors fined an online pharmacy that advertised itself as Canada's \"largest\" -- CanadaDrugs.com -- $34 million for funneling counterfeit cancer drugs into the United States. The two medicines, Avastin and Altuzan, contained no active ingredient -- they were completely useless.\n\nTo make matters worse, the majority of drugs imported from pharmacies that bill themselves as Canadian aren't actually manufactured in Canada. One FDA anti-counterfeiting investigation revealed that 85 percent of illegally imported, supposedly \"Canadian\" drugs came from 27 other countries, including Turkey and India. Many of the drugs that originated in these markets turned out to be counterfeit.\n\nNone of this is surprising. Canadian authorities have made it clear that they are not responsible for guaranteeing the safety of drugs that cross their border. And under Republican and Democratic administrations alike, the FDA has repeatedly stated that it can't guarantee the quality of drugs American patients import from Canada or anywhere else.\n\nIn other words, there's no such thing as a safe importation scheme. No matter what politicians say, counterfeit drugs are too pervasive for regulators to protect American patients. No wonder Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar calls drug importation \"a gimmick.\"\n\nIt's important for lawmakers to find ways to lower patients' drug bills. But any plan that would endanger Americans' health is no solution at all.", "description": "Ron DeSantis, Florida's Republican governor, recently signed a bill that .10/08/2019 20:30:20PM EST.", "authors": ["Kenneth E.", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/288/1f6d0799-d3ed-433b-8316-a5c45875bce7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
