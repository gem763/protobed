Chris Murphy's endorsement of an impeachment inquiry sealed what many of his colleagues had long suspected: Gun negotiations have fallen apart. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Congress 'Lost opportunity': Guns talks cease amid impeachment push\n\nIt had been five days since Chris Murphy had heard from the Trump administration on negotiations over expanding background checks on gun sales. On the sixth day, the Connecticut Democrat endorsed an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nThe move sealed what many of Murphy\u2019s colleagues had long suspected: That gun negotiations have fallen apart and may be impossible to resurrect now that the vast majority of House Democrats and a growing minority of Democratic senators are now calling for the president\u2019s impeachment. The prospect of cutting a deal with the president that was at odds with the NRA was always a long-shot, but now it seems downright implausible for Trump to negotiate on guns with Democrats seeking to oust him from office.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLawmakers like to talk about walking and chewing gum at the same time, but Murphy acknowledges that the march toward impeachment \u201cmay temporarily be the end of the road for a lot of legislative initiatives,\u201d including his.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything since Wednesday and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s coincidental to this crisis,\u201d Murphy said in an interview, adding that administration officials told him they were trying to \u201cquickly\u201d release a proposal in that Wednesday meeting. \u201cI understand calling for impeachment proceedings to begin could chill the administration\u2019s interest in working with me on background checks. But this is about the future of the Republic.\u201d\n\nOne of Murphy\u2019s key negotiating partners, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), said he\u2019d last spoken to Trump about background checks last Thursday. That was the day reporting began to emerge on a whistleblower regarding Trump\u2019s conversation with the president of Ukraine.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

But I acknowledge that a lot of clamoring for impeachment is not helpful,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cIt makes it more difficult.\u201d\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), the third senator working to broker a gun deal, said he hadn\u2019t spoken to the White House since last week: \u201cThings have been quiet right now.\u201d\n\nSince that conversation with Toomey, Trump has largely confirmed press reports that he brought up former Vice President Joe Biden in a July 25 conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and that he\u2019d directed a delay in aid to Ukraine before it, admissions that created an impeachment snowball.\n\nTrump hit back at Democrats Tuesday afternoon, tweeting that \"the Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety.\"\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, speaking at The Atlantic\u2019s Ideas Summit in Washington, confirmed that Trump called her Tuesday morning to talk about gun violence and told her \u201cwe're getting close to a solution.\u201d But then the conversation \u201csegued into other things,\u201d she added.\n\nThe topic of guns also came up during the Senate lunch on Tuesday, according to White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland.\n\n\"We have continued to be engaged with the Hill, we're still working to try to explore whether or not there's a path forward and we remain hopeful that we can discover a path forward for the president's review,\" Ueland said.\n\nWhen asked whether discussion surrounding impeachment and the Ukraine call could complicate legislation on guns or other topics, Ueland responded that he is focused \"on the day job, which is delivering results up here on the Hill on behalf of the president.\"\n\nThe discussions between senators and the president were always an underdog to produce a breakthrough, but they showed unusual durability since a trio of mass shootings in August brought Trump to the table.\n\nBut the talks appear unable to survive a Democratic impeachment pile-on. Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who\u2019s shown some willingness to expand background checks and potentially buck the NRA, called it a \u201clost opportunity.\u201d He said it reminded him of when Trump blew up a May meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on infrastructure after the speaker suggested Trump was engaged in a \u201ccover-up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sets a negative tone and stage for doing a lot of other things,\u201d Braun said of the impeachment trajectory. \"It probably will eat up the lot of energy in the room to talk about other things that I think the public is interested in our addressing, which would be commonsense gun reforms and ... health care.\"\n\nMurphy said it was easier to come out for impeachment amid discussions with the White House, in part because \u201cit seems more likely than not that the president is going to side with the NRA once again.\u201d After Attorney General William Barr and White House legislative director Eric Ueland met with senators last week about background checks, a draft of one proposal leaked out and was quickly savaged by the NRA and abandoned by the White House.\n\nAfter that cool reception and the ensuing Ukraine drip of stories, it was evident Democrats weren\u2019t going to bide their time on impeachment just because Trump hadn\u2019t officially closed the door on guns. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) had also been discussing a firearms package with Republicans that would expand red flag laws, but he too came out for impeachment proceedings on Tuesday.\n\nBlumenthal was less bearish than Murphy, but he\u2019s also less intimately involved with Trump, who has repeatedly assailed Blumenthal on Twitter over the past three years.\n\n\u201cWhatever our stance on impeachment or the whistleblower complaint, we should be moving forward,\u201d Blumenthal said.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me Congress should be able to handle both issues,\u201d argued Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who had been talked to Ueland and other senators. \u201cI hope very much that we will turn to a package of responsible gun safety bills that can pass the Senate.\"\n\nBut though negotiators were unwilling to officially call it quits, the end was obvious to others.\n\n\"I'm afraid that that ship may have sailed. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any effort by the White House to try to find a reasonable bipartisan approach,\" said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). \"The president\u2019s word is not good.\"\n\nMelanie Zanona contributed to this report.", "description": "\"A lot of clamoring for impeachment is not helpful,\u201d said Pat Toomey.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett", "Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9f/47/d9937c9640c7a996b89be17c1811/20190924-chris-murphy-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
