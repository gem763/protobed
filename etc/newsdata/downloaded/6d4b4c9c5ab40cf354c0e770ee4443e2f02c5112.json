The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line makes a low in late June, but its rise does not look as strong as the price rise, which suggests that buyers of MU are not particularly aggressive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is crossing to the downside to a take-profits sell signal, and at a lower high than it made in July, also giving us a bearish divergence.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart below, the picture is more positive. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving-average line. The weekly OBV line is positive, as is the MACD oscillator. That's a stronger picture than the daily chart above.\n\nIn the Point and Figure chart of MU below, we see a potential upside price target of near $69. A trade at $51.53 will refresh the uptrend and a trade at $48.54 will weaken the chart.\n\nBottom line strategy: Leaning more on the daily time frame than the weekly chart, I would look for MU to trade sideways for a number of weeks. Look for prices to be bounded by $45 and $55.", "description": "Trading volume has been shrinking from late June and this is not the picture technical analysts like to see....WDC", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Micron Stock May Trade In A Range For Several Weeks Due To Mixed Indicators", "Trading Volume Has Been Shrinking Late June", "This Is Not The Picture Technical Analysts Like To See.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Alex Frew Mcmillan", "Stephen Guilfoyle"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/c789a333-4c0e-11e9-b5b3-9542bc0a9dee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
