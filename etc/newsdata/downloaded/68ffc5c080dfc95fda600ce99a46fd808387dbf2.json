It raised the top marginal tax rate to 13.3 percent for incomes of more than $1 million.\n\nThe new rates were retroactively applied to 2012 and scheduled to expire at the end of 2018. They have since been extended through 2030.\n\nThe study found a consequent \u201csharp uptick\u201d in wealthy taxpayer departures in 2013 when compared with previous years, particularly among those earning between $2 million to $5 million and more than $5 million.\n\nAbout 0.8 percent of wealthy residents who would have had to pay the top tax rate left the state \u2013 which was considered \u201cabnormally high\u201d when compared with years prior. And the wealthy individuals who stayed reported lower incomes.\n\n\u201cAmong top-bracket California taxpayers, outward migration and behavioral responses by stayers together eroded 45.2 percent of the windfall tax revenues from the reform in 2013,\u201d researchers Joshua Rauh and Ryan Shyu wrote.\n\nThe majority of those residents left for states with zero income tax, Rauh and Shyu said.\n\nResearchers noted it is important to understand how wealthy taxpayers respond to tax hikes, since they are implemented to raise revenue for the state.\n\nAn out-migration of residents from high-tax states \u2013 like New York, New Jersey and California \u2013 has been compounded throughout recent years thanks to changes made to the federal tax code by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in 2017. It implemented a $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions.\n\nDemocratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has already expressed concern an out-migration from the state could hurt its revenues. Cuomo has said he expects the cap on state and local tax deductions to have a negative impact on the state\u2019s population \u2013 and tax receipts. He blamed a $2.3 billion budget deficit on the new tax law, calling the state\u2019s financial situation \u201cas serious as a heart attack\u201d as wealthy residents leave.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe financial benefits of moving from a high-tax state to a low-tax state can be substantial.
