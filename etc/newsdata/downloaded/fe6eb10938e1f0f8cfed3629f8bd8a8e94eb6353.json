This one might\u2019ve had a bit more juice a week ago, but the Tigers\u2019 trip to the Carrier Dome still stacks up as the best game of a weekend in which four ACC teams face off against FCS schools. Syracuse (1-1) remains the last ACC team to beat Clemson (2-0), knocking off the Tigers two years ago in their last visit north after an injury to QB Kelly Bryant . The rematch might have been the nation\u2019s biggest game, had the Orange not been blown out by Maryland last week.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nNorth Carolina State\u2019s defense vs. West Virginia\u2019s offense. New N.C. State co-defensive coordinator Tony Gibson served two lengthy stints on the Mountaineers\u2019 staff and interviewed for the head coaching job that ultimately went to Neal Brown after Dana Holgorsen left for Houston. Now he\u2019s in charge of a Wolfpack defense that has yet to allow a touchdown and is giving up 24.5 yards rushing per game. That could mean trouble for a West Virginia ground game that ranks 129th nationally (32 ypg) and was at minus-7 yards rushing in the second half of a blowout loss at Missouri.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nOnly three teams in the Bowl Subdivision have two victories over Power 5 schools and two of them are in the ACC. Clemson opened with wins over Georgia Tech and Texas A&M;, and North Carolina owns victories over South Carolina and Miami. The third member of that club is Hawaii, which is 2-0 against the Pac-12 after beating Arizona and Oregon State.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nMaybe Pittsburgh can put a scare into an instate rival in their last scheduled meeting. The Panthers are 17-point underdogs at No. 13 Penn State in the finale of their four-game series. Pitt has once again gone into lockdown mode, with coach Pat Narduzzi declining to make any players available to the media this week. The Panthers will have to find a way to continue Penn State\u2019s struggles in the ground game after the Nittany Lions managed just 78 yards rushing against Buffalo.\n\nIMPACT PLAYER\n\nBryce Perkins could be in for a big game. The Virginia quarterback might be the conference\u2019s most exciting player - at least among those who don\u2019t play for Clemson - and he\u2019s going up against a Florida State defense that ranks last in the league overall (520 ypg) and in points allowed (40 ppg). Perkins, who set a school record with 3,603 total yards a year ago, is slightly off that pace with 485 through two games for the 25th-ranked Cavaliers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball , http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ap-top-25-college-football-podcast/id1138957862?mt=2\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Here are things to watch in the Atlantic Coast Conference in Week 3:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joedy Mccreary"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/texas_a_m_clemson_football_25115_c0-182-1928-1306_s1770x1032.jpg?a18edef162bbb13f1d2730cb27c1a5a410bc7213", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
