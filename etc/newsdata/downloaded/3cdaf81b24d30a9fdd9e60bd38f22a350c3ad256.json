Consumer Products for over five years, previously unveiling the Skylab Batman watch.\n\n\u201cAfter so many successful years of collaboration on exclusive Batman watches, they trusted us completely to design a watch that channels the essence of the Joker character,\u201d says Marco Tedeschi, 34, CEO of RJ Watches.\n\nThe Joker has been the nemesis of Gotham City\u2019s crimefighter since the very first edition of the DC comic in 1940.\n\nThe RJ Joker chronograph features a circular satin-brushed 45mm titanium case with four rubber bumpers and arrow-shaped hands, known as ARRAW. For the 100 limited editions, each Joker dial is individually hand-painted, meaning no Joker watches will have the exact same make-up.\n\nThe Dial Courtesy of RJ Watches\n\nThe ARRAW hands on the Joker watch are stylized with playing card \u2018Aces\u2019 at their tips. The same \u2018Aces\u2019 are used as dial markers while the chronograph\u2019s second hand is finished in purple with the letter \u201cJ\u201d at its base.\n\nThe reverse of the titanium case features a bold laser-engraved portrait of the Joker himself.\n\nAs part of the collectors\u2019 edition, each watch will be presented with an exclusive deck of Joker playing cards. It also comes with three interchangeable straps.\n\nThe watch is decorated with 57 jewels and has a water resistance up to 100 meters (330 feet).\n\nUnder Tedeschi\u2019s leadership, the watch company was rebranded RJ from Romain Jerome, and has been reinventing its distribution network in the United States. Watches of Switzerland Soho is its first official U.S. brick-and-mortar retail partner.", "description": "Limited editions of the timepiece inspired by the DC Comics villain will be available at Watches of Switzerland Soho in New York", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-114615/social", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
