Buyout firms also have large public market assets, which they are looking to sell off at a profit.\n\nBlackstone said its private equity portfolio appreciated 2.6% in the third quarter. Opportunistic and core real estate funds rose by 3.8% and 2.3% respectively.\n\nThe firm raised a record $26 billion for its flagship buyout fund during the quarter, as it benefited from a strong fundraising environment driven by institutional investors seeking higher returns amid low interest rates.\n\nTotal assets under management rose to a $554 billion in the three months to September, up 2% from $545.5 billion in the prior quarter.
