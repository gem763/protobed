The region is controlled by US-backed Kurdish groups which Ankara views as terrorists affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK). Ankara claims that its actions will allow Syrian refugees to return to their homes. The military operation, however, has been widely condemned by the international community, including many of Turkey\u2019s NATO allies in Europe. In response, President Erdogan threatened to allow millions of refugees currently living in Turkey to enter the EU.\n\nAlso on rt.com Turkey bombs Syria: Erdogan begins \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019\n\nLike this story?
