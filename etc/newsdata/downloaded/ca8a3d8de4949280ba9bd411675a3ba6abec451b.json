But while Bed Bath & Beyond stores might offer some good ones, its stock doesn\u2019t look like a bargain after soaring following the appointment of a new CEO.\n\nIt isn\u2019t that Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) made a poor choice. This past Thursday, it announced that Target\u2019s (TGT) chief merchandising officer, Mark Tritton, would take the helm. Hiring someone with Tritton\u2019s expertise to oversee a turnaround effort is very good news. If nothing else, he has the skills to fix one of the chain\u2019s biggest problems\u2014its lack of distinctive products. Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski calls its assortment \u201ccommoditized\u201d and suggests that Tritton\u2019s background in private-label goods could go a long way toward remedying that.\n\nIndeed, the stock soared 31%, to $12.98, in the two days after the Tritton announcement\u2014and is up 75% since its August low. That climb began seemingly out of nothing. It started before reports, perhaps spurred by an activist\u2019s involvement, that Goldman Sachs had been hired to lead an auction of some of its noncore units. And it began before a string of upgrades from analysts bullish about the possibilities if Bed Bath & Beyond finally hired a new CEO. That\u2019s a long way of saying that the news might actually be reflected in the stock price.\n\nNow comes the hard part.\n\nJefferies\u2019 Matuszewski left his rating on the stock at Neutral, citing the \u201crisk inherent in an early-stage transformation with no notable inflection in fundamentals yet.\u201d He\u2019s right about that. Same-store sales have dropped by more than 6% in the past two quarters, while revenue is expected to decline by 5.7%, to $11.35 billion, in fiscal 2020.\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of pricing. For Bed Bath & Beyond to compete online with the likes of Amazon.com (AMZN), it needs to lower its prices. And that is exactly what it has been doing, according to Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba. He compared prices on 50 goods and found that Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s were 8.6% higher than Amazon\u2019s, though they\u2019re cheaper if shoppers use one of the chain\u2019s 20%-off coupons. That makes Bed Bath & Beyond more competitive, but probably isn\u2019t good for its stock, Chukumba writes. \u201cWhile we typically view more competitive pricing as a positive...we believe this will place pressure on BBBY\u2019s gross margin,\u201d he explains.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nBut perhaps the biggest reason for caution is that Bed Bath & Beyond isn\u2019t Target. Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem argues that shoppers go to the two stores for different reasons, and that Target never had Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s store-traffic problems. Throw in the potential margin issues that could come with more competitive pricing and greater online sales, and the stock looks like it might have gotten ahead of itself.\n\n\u201cWith Bed Bath & Beyond shares up about 20% post-announcement, we see the market putting the cart before the horse,\u201d Fadem writes. Though he raised his price target to $10, from $9, after Tritton\u2019s appointment, Fadem reiterated his Underperform rating on the stock.\n\nSure, Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s shares are still cheap. They now trade at 6.8 times 12-month forward earnings, up from 3.9 times at their August low. We\u2019re just not sure that is cheap enough.\n\nWrite to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com", "description": "New CEO Mark Tritton has the skills to refresh Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s merchandise.
