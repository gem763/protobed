As far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019re dead,\u201d he said.\n\nHis remarks to White House reporters leave critical decisions about the 18-year-old war in Afghanistan in the air, including whether the U.S. will withdraw troops planned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to get out, but we\u2019ll get out at the right time,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump made headlines Saturday night by announcing that he\u2019d scrapped the proposed meeting north of Washington, after learning of the bombing Thursday in Kabul that killed Sgt. 1st Class Elis Barreto Ortiz, 34, from Puerto Rico, along with a Romanian soldier and at least 10 Afghan civilians.\n\nMr. Trump faced heat for even thinking about letting the Taliban step foot at Camp David ahead of the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, since they were accused of sheltering al Qaeda members who planned the attack.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters he did, however, refuse to hold the meeting at the White House, saying he thought \u201cthat would be a step too far.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, the president blasted the Taliban for publicly boasting that a series of deadly attacks, which have killed dozens of civilians and three other U.S. service members over the past two weeks in Afghanistan, were increasing the group\u2019s leverage at the negotiating table with Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that the administration recalled Mr. Khalilzad, who\u2019d been holding talks with Taliban representatives in Qatar for nearly a year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
