They had no idea they were even in the United States.\n\n\"They were just trying to get back to their hotel.\"\n\nAldea - a legal services provided - has complained to the US Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, and Mrs Cambria said that although no paperwork has been provided, it is likely the family will be deported back to the UK.", "description": "David and Eileen Connors' say their three-month-old baby was also put in prison and has reportedly developed an eye condition", "authors": ["Chris Flanagan", "Image", "Ice"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20582708.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Eileen-Connors.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
