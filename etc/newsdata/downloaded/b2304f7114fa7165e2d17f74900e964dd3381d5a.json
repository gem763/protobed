(Michael Spooneybarger/Reuters)\n\nIf we go by the attitudes of the American people, both the New York and Alabama laws are extreme.\n\n\u2018Democrats are aggressively pushing late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother\u2019s womb right up until the moment of birth,\u201d President Trump said at a Florida rally earlier this month. \u201cThe baby is born and you wrap the baby beautifully and you talk to the mother about the possible execution of the baby.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor cable news talking heads and leading Democrats, this is a demagogic lie. The fact-checkers mostly say it\u2019s a distortion and exaggeration \u2014 and it is. It\u2019s a distortion of something Virginia governor Ralph Northam said days before revelations that he dressed in blackface (or in a Klan outfit) during medical school eclipsed the Virginia abortion controversy.\n\nTrump has been referencing Northam\u2019s remarks since January, when Kathy Tran, a Democratic Virginia delegate, introduced legislation to liberalize abortion in her state. During a colloquy with a Republican lawmaker, Tran said her bill would legalize abortions through the 40th week of pregnancy, including during labor. (She later said she misspoke when it was pointed out that this would violate infanticide laws.)\n\nThe next day, Northam \u2014 a pediatric neurologist by training \u2014 appeared on a local radio station to support Tran and her bill. He explained how, in cases where a fetus was not viable, \u201cthe infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if this is what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Northam never said anything about \u201cexecuting\u201d babies. But Tran\u2019s legislation would have allowed late-term abortions of viable, non-deformed babies solely if the mother\u2019s mental or emotional health was threatened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTran\u2019s bill didn\u2019t pass, but it was part of a trend in liberal states to loosen abortion laws even further. Earlier in January, Democratic New York governor Andrew Cuomo had signed similar legislation.\n\nAll of this is worth keeping in mind amid the furor over Alabama\u2019s near-total abortion ban. If we go by the attitudes of the American people, both the New York and the Alabama laws are extreme. Polling on abortion is notoriously fraught. Wording matters enormously because many Americans are conflicted on the issue. But generally, most Americans support early-stage abortions, and opposition grows along with the fetus. According to Gallup, 60 percent of Americans support abortion rights in the first trimester, but only 13 percent do in the third trimester.\n\nThat the media yawned over New York\u2019s law but remain in a frenzy over Alabama\u2019s says a lot about where the press comes down on the issue. But it also speaks to the legal and political landscape. Even Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a strong defender of abortion rights, has called the court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision a \u201cheavy-handed judicial intervention\u201d and said she would have preferred that abortion rights were secured more gradually, with greater buy-in at the state level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder Roe v. Wade (and later Planned Parenthood v. Casey), the court not only imposed one of the most permissive abortion regimes in the world, it foreclosed state-level compromise, galvanizing the pro-life movement and causing both pro-choicers and pro-lifers to take more absolutist positions.\n\nAlabama\u2019s law is clearly unconstitutional under current precedent. But that\u2019s the point. Alabama\u2019s GOP legislators deliberately passed an unconstitutional law in the hope that the court\u2019s new conservative majority would overthrow Roe and Casey. New York\u2019s Democratic lawmakers weren\u2019t trying to test Roe or Casey, but to create a post-Roe abortion \u201csanctuary\u201d in case the court does reverse Roe. In other words, Roe is not a \u201cmoderate\u201d ruling. Purely in terms of public attitudes, it permits pro-choice extremism (abortions in the 40th week!) but not pro-life extremism (total bans).\n\nHence, Roe made it necessary for the pro-life movement to embrace an incremental strategy, working to change attitudes, chip away at Roe at the margins, and reduce the abortion rate (with considerable success). But now that some think the brass ring is in sight, the movement has split between incrementalists and those \u2014 like the sponsors of the Alabama bill \u2014 who think it\u2019s worth going for broke. (I think the go-for-broke crowd is miscalculating.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe underlying political reality is that most Americans want a compromise, but the parties are more responsive to the activists and donors. As a result, Democrats have abandoned their \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d rhetoric, while Republicans are downplaying a \u201cculture of life.\u201d Instead, each seeks to cast the other party as extreme. Republicans highlight rare late-term abortions, and Democrats focus on the also-rare cases of 12-year-olds impregnated by their rapist fathers.\n\nRoe created this polarized \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 dynamic in which the debate is dominated by the extremes. Overturning Roe and allowing states to pass laws that reflect majority opinion might not defuse the political passion, but at some point we are likely to find out.\n\n(C) 2019 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY, LLC", "description": "Republicans highlight rare late-term abortions, and Democrats focus on the also-rare cases of 12-year-olds impregnated by their rapist fathers.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
