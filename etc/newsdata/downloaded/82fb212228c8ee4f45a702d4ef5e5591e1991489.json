The right foods can help boost your mood in a more sustainable way.\n\nWhen we're feeling down or stressed, many of us immediately start thinking of how much better a bar of chocolate would make us feel. The reality, however, is that the lift the chocolate provides tends to be short-lived, leaving us feeling even worse than before.\n\nA \"quick fix\", usually in the form of sugar, is not the answer. We need the nutrients (and good health practices) to provide us with the brain chemicals that will give us a sustained \"lift\".\n\nAmp up the 'happy' brain messengers\n\nThe four main brain messengers or neurotransmitters that contribute to our feelings of well-being are endorphins, dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin. The neurotransmitter most often targeted by modern medicine is serotonin \u2013 for example SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).\n\nThere are, however, natural ways to activate these parts of the brain.\n\nLow levels of serotonin are associated with mood disorders such as depression. Foods can contribute to increase the natural production of serotonin in the following ways:\n\n1. Include more tryptophan\n\nAim for small doses of the amino acid tryptophan (1g), as this is converted to molecules which lead to increased serotonin levels. There is 1g of tryptophan in each of the following:\n\n200g soya beans\n\n200g lean protein\n\n200g ricotta cheese\n\n300g fish\n\nOther foods that contain natural serotonin include bananas, avocados and tomatoes.\n\n2. Give back to your gut\n\nAs 80\u201390% of our serotonin production occurs in our gut, improving gut health will contribute to an improvement in mood. You can improve your gut health by doing the following:\n\nDrink four to six glasses of water daily.\n\nEat foods high in fibre.\n\nEat fermented foods (yoghurt, mageu, kombucha, kefir), or regularly take a probiotic supplement.\n\n3. Manage your blood glucose levels\n\nWhen your blood sugar levels go on a roller coaster ride during the course of the day, it will affect your mood. You may feel irritable, moody, tired, struggle to concentrate and experience cravings for sweet foods. Maintain optimal blood sugar levels by:\n\nEating regular meals and avoiding skipping meals.\n\nAvoiding foods high in sugar and white flour.\n\nSubstituting unhealthy refined carbohydrates for healthier ones that are higher in fibre and unprocessed, such as fresh fruit and vegetables (but watch the number of fruits per day), barley, brown rice, quinoa, spelt, lentils, beans, chickpeas, oats, baby potatoes, sweet potatoes and corn. (A starch should have more than 6g of fibre per 100g to be considered \"high fibre\".)\n\nEating smaller portions.\n\n4. Ease up on the caffeine\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can increase anxiety in some poor metabolizers, and can negatively affect sleep and, therefore, mood.\n\nReduce caffeine in the diet to less than 300mg/day. Common drinks high in caffeine are fizzy cold-drinks (30\u201340mg), green tea (35mg), black tea (55mg), energy drinks (80mg), instant coffee (76\u2013106mg) and brewed coffee (100\u2013170mg) per 250ml cup. Decaffeinated coffee contains only 3\u201315mg per 250ml cup.\n\nDrink caffeine-free alternatives such as rooibos tea, herbal teas, or infused water in the afternoon and evenings.\n\n5. Get your omegas\n\nDiets high in healthy omega-3 polyunsaturated fats have been shown to reduce inflammation and therefore certain mood disorders like depression. Omega-3 fats will reduce neuroinflammation and improve the integrity and structural composition of cell membranes. You can increase your intake of these fatty acids by:\n\nEnjoying at least 3 x 90g portions of fatty fish a week, such as salmon, trout, sardines, pilchards and mackerel. Practical ideas to increase your intake are to add salmon to scrambled egg, enjoy trout with cottage cheese on whole grain crackers, eat pilchards on toast, top sardines on crackers with raw tomato and onion, enjoying a salmon salad as a light meal in a restaurant or choosing tinned salmon and mayo for a sandwich filling.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like fatty fish, aiming for a minimum of 1000mg per day of EPA and DHA combined, by taking an omega-3 supplement.\n\n5. Manage your magnesium\n\nHigher levels of magnesium can help support deep, restorative sleep by maintaining healthy levels of GABA. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep.\n\nHaving a good night\u2019s sleep has a positive effect on one\u2019s mood. Foods containing magnesium include whole grains such as barley or buckwheat, dried figs, nuts, pulses and green leafy vegetables.\n\nTo wrap up\n\nSo next time you are looking for a \"pick-me-up\", avoid a quick fix and go for something that will sustain you. For a mood that remains stable, eat foods that support serotonin, improve your gut health and optimise your blood sugar levels. In addition, slow down on caffeine and increase your omega-3 fats and magnesium intake.\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "If you find comfort in a chocolate bar from the canteen at work when you feel stressed, you might want to read on...
