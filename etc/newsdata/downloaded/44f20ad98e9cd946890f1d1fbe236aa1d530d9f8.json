Eric Swalwell, who tried to make a point using pro-2nd Amendment comments from Ben Shapiro:\n\nPlease tell me this lunatic does not own a gun. Reason 1,578 America needs red flag laws. https://t.co/NA9IPs0CDV \u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) October 12, 2019\n\nSwalwell in fact proved a point, but not the one he intended to make:\n\nReason 1,579,426 why any red flag law would surely be abused by the lunatics on the Left https://t.co/cKmwrbVgMw \u2014 Fusilli Spock (@awstar11) October 12, 2019\n\nAdd another one to the pile!\n\nIf this is your criteria for the necessity and efficacy of #RedFlagLaws, then we DEFINITELY do not need them. Then again, @benshapiro must be a violent extremist since words are violence to the new left. Next you'll call him an anti-Semitic Nazi fascist white supremacist. \u2014 JD Rucker (@JDRucker) October 12, 2019\n\nThis is a purposefully melodramatic and ridiculous take on someone using absurdity to highlight absurdity.

There is no recognition of who is truly threatening who here. https://t.co/HCy4hF26zy \u2014 Chief (@GloomAndDrewm) October 12, 2019\n\nActually, you're demonstrating the reasons we cannot have \"red flag laws.\" You are a DUMB PERSON. https://t.co/keryMDuryh \u2014 thebradfordfile\u2122 (@thebradfordfile) October 12, 2019\n\nYes, we need red flag laws so politicians can disarm American citizens. They will be so much easier to control when they can't fight back. Democrats are so naive they have no idea that they are reinforcing the reason why we have the 2A. https://t.co/3nd6oRqDCv \u2014 Ben Crazy (@ben_crazy76) October 12, 2019\n\nWhen they take away your first amendment right and you want to use your second amendment right to protect against the infringement of your first, they will take that away too. https://t.co/UJmnNftWbP \u2014 JohnEric (@overboard182) October 12, 2019\n\nDuke Nukem coming for your guns for political disagreement. \u2014 Underdog (@rdbrewer4) October 12, 2019\n\nYou can sign them into law when you are President.
