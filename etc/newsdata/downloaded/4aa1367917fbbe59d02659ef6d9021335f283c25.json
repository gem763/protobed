It threatens to swallow up everything you plan to do and be. I became Emily Doe,\u201d Miller says in a voice-over as animations drawn by her appear on screen. \u201cAssault teaches you to shrink, makes you afraid to exist. Shame, really, can kill you.\u201d\n\nMiller wrote, illustrated and narrates the short film, which is titled \u201cI Am With You\u201d and was released in conjunction with her memoir \u201cKnow My Name.\u201d Miller, known as \u201cEmily Doe\u201d throughout the trial, publicly revealed her identity earlier this month while announcing the release of her memoir.\n\n\u201cI Am With You\u201d explores the very painful trauma of living through such a public trial and sentencing, even as many people who knew her personally did not know she was \u201cEmily Doe.\u201d The short film reveals what she was going through during that time and how she has learned to cope with \u2015 and at points thrive in \u2015 her newfound identity as a survivor of sexual assault.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to be defined by the worst thing that\u2019s happened to them,\u201d Miller says in the film. \u201cNo one gets to define you. You do. You do. My name is Chanel, and I am with you.\u201d\n\nTurner was found guilty of sexually assaulting Miller behind a dumpster at Stanford University while she was unconscious.\n\nTurner faced up to 14 years in prison, but the judge overseeing the case, Aaron Persky, said a prison sentence would \u201chave a severe impact\u201d on Turner. He sentenced Turner to six months in jail. Turner was released early on good behavior, serving three months in jail after being convicted on three felony assault charges. Persky\u2019s controversial decision later got him recalled from the bench.\n\nWatch Miller\u2019s full animated short below.", "description": "\"I Am With You\" explores the trauma of living through such a public trial and sentencing.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a200023000059006d35c4.png?cache=jjhnv0mwin&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
