It will use recordings the stars provide as the basis for other computer-generated utterances.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Samuel L Jackson's voice will be offered in both a \"clean\" and an \"explicit\" mode for Alexa\n\nIn the case of Avengers actor Samuel L Jackson, consumers will be given the choice of whether they want a version that swears or not.\n\nThe firm said other famous stars - who will be paid for their services - will follow.\n\nAmazon recently announced it was upgrading its music streaming service to a \"high definition\" format to help its fortunes.\n\nIts new Studio speaker should provide users with a means to appreciate the extra detail it offers. Like Sonos' kit, it fine tunes its sound to suit the acoustics of the room it is placed in.\n\nAnd two of the $200 (\u00a3190 in the UK) speakers can be paired and connected to a Fire TV stick or television to create a home theatre experience.\n\n\"Amazon has never really had a smart speaker which was marketed specifically for its audio quality, in the manner of an Apple HomePod or a Google Home Max,\" commented Ben Stanton from the tech consultancy Canalys.\n\n\"Typically, third-parties like Harman and Sonos would be the ones to differentiate in this space on Amazon's behalf.\n\n\"If it [lives up to its promise], it will cannibalise these third-party products, and leave little room left for third-party smart speaker vendors to innovate.\"\n\nAmazon's stock closed the day 1.5% higher, while shares in Sonos sank 5% lower.\n\nPrivacy worries\n\nAmazon's devices chief Dave Limp addressed users' privacy concerns early on during the launch event at the firm's Seattle headquarters, even showing a tweet it had received complaining about one of its speakers activating without the trigger word \"Alexa\" being uttered.\n\n\"We care about this,\" he said.\n\n\"Privacy is absolutely foundational to everything we do in and around Alexa.\"\n\nImage copyright Amazon Image caption Mr Limp showed a tweet in which a British father-of-three had expressed concerns about Alexa\n\nHe highlighted the fact that users can now command a device to delete everything they have said that day. In addition, the firm recently added an option to its Alexa app to let users opt out of having their voices transcribed by humans to improve the service's accuracy.\n\nHowever, some of its rivals - including Apple and Google - have gone further by requiring their users to opt in to similar programmes.\n\n\"Privacy is a huge issue for all technology manufacturers and recent revelations show that Amazon is vulnerable,\" commented Adam Simon from the market intelligence firm Context.\n\n\"All our research shows that it is a major concern to consumers.\n\n\"Yet, ironically, it is not the most important barrier preventing people buying smart home products. Privacy is far outweighed by lack of understanding, lack of perception of value, and lack of good use cases.\"\n\nHe added that later this year, users will be able to ask Alexa \"why did you do that?\", to question it about unexpected behaviour.\n\nFurthermore, a new setting will allow them to set recordings to be auto-deleted after a set period of time ranging from three to 18 months.\n\nImage caption Amazon said it decided to launch a smart oven after its previous Alexa-enabled microwave became a bestseller\n\nOther announcements included a new 8in (20.3cm) Echo Show smart display, which can now show group video calls with several people on-screen at once.\n\nIt features the same \"high definition\" screen resolution as the 10in model, but only a one megapixel camera versus the 5MP sensor in the larger device.\n\nThat means it will likely never add the kind of auto-framing feature that Facebook's Portal and Google Nest Hub Max video chat devices offer, which is achieved by cropping into the image.\n\nImage copyright Amazon Image caption The Echo Show 8 has similar quality speakers but a lower resolution camera than the older Echo Show (2nd Gen)\n\nOther new kit included:\n\na small version of its smart speaker that plugs directly into the wall and features a port into which owners can plug accessories such as a motion sensor or a nightlight, called the Echo Flex\n\nan internet-connected lamp that can change colours in time with music, called the Echo Glow\n\na voice-controlled smart fan oven, which can also cook food via microwaves or an oil-based \"air-fryer\". It can be paired to a smartphone to allow users to scan packaged foods' barcodes to set the device to cook them at the appropriate temperatures for the recommended amount of times\n\na new wireless protocol called Sidewalk, which can connect devices up to 500m (0.3 miles) away - giving it an advantage over Bluetooth and wifi - but uses less power than a 4G or 5G data link\n\nSkip Twitter post by @PatrickMoorhead Alexa Flex very interesting. Most interesting announce so far. What Nvidia Spot was supposed to be. Small speaker, USB port on bottom and optional smart motion sensor and nighlight. Amazon will sell a ton of these #AskAlexa pic.twitter.com/qx84ZfM1g0 \u2014 Patrick Moorhead (@PatrickMoorhead) September 25, 2019 Report\n\nMr Limp also announced changes to its Ring-branded smart doorbells.\n\nThese will now gain use of Alexa, including a service that will allow visitors to record a message if the owner is out and unable to answer remotely via the device's app.\n\nHe also unveiled new Ring hardware including a security camera for inside the home - which will compete against Google's Nest Cam as well as similar products from Hive and Canary - and a \"retrofit\" kit that adds smart features to existing alarm systems.", "description": "The firm has also addressed privacy concerns about its smart assistant technology.", "authors": ["Leo Kelion", "Technology Desk Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/145E2/production/_108962438_679bea.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
