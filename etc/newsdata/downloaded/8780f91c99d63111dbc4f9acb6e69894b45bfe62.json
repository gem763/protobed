Ivanka has always been the president\u2019s favorite and superficially she has the most potential. She\u2019s smart, beautiful, perfectly comfortable on camera, and has a reputation as a moderate that might attract voters scared away by dad\u2019s rough edges. The problem is that she has no constituency. Democrats will loathe her forever for participating in her father\u2019s administration; some Trump administration veterans might be able to claw back respect from the opposition (Mattis, for one) but Ivanka and Jared definitely won\u2019t. Meanwhile, she and Kushner are viewed suspiciously by the populist right as Democrats in Republican clothing, obstacles to the nationalist agenda that true believers like Steve Bannon tried to implement. Trumpers like the president\u2019s rough edges, his willingness to be politically incorrect. Ivanka has none of that. She belongs at Davos, not at a MAGA rally with the working class.\n\nIf there\u2019s a Trump child with a constituency on the right it\u2019s Junior, who has embraced his father\u2019s populist base while Ivanka\u2019s kept her distance. It\u2019s Don who likes to mix it up on Twitter and talk trash about opponents occasionally on Fox News. And it\u2019s Don, not Ivanka, who\u2019s been outspoken in support of the Trump agenda, especially on the trail. If there\u2019s a political heir here, writes McKay Coppins, it\u2019ll be him, not her.\n\nDon discovered that he had a knack for campaigning. Bounding into county fairs and hunting expos in boots and blue jeans, he dazzled crowds with his knowledge of duck blinds and fly-fishing\u2014sounding more like a Trump voter than a Trump. He thrived in the shouty, testosterone-soaked realm of #MAGA Twitter, where his provocations routinely went viral. Don\u2019s habit of amplifying memes from the right-wing fever swamps generated controversy. (One infamous tweet compared Syrian refugees to poisonous Skittles; another featured the alt-right mascot Pepe the Frog.) But it also helped turn him into a kind of Breitbartian folk hero\u2026 To the surprise of many in elite GOP circles, he also excelled at schmoozing wealthy donors, raising millions of dollars for conservatives in closed-door fundraisers. \u201cHe\u2019s as good in a room of six people as he is in a room of 6,000,\u201d says Tommy Hicks Jr., a co-chair of the Republican National Committee and a friend of Don\u2019s\u2026 By November 2018, Don had appeared at more than 70 campaign events across 17 states\u2014and powerful Republicans were abuzz. \u201cI could very easily see him entering politics,\u201d Senator Kevin Cramer told me. \u201cI think his future is bright,\u201d said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Newsmax\u2019s CEO, Chris Ruddy, told me he\u2019d personally encouraged Don to run for office; Sean Hannity called him \u201ca born natural leader.\u201d Senator Rand Paul went so far as to say that Don was one of the best Republican campaigners in the country. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get the president,\u201d Paul told me, \u201che\u2019s a close second.\u201d\n\nWhile Don Jr was getting press like that, notes Coppins, Ivanka was getting press like this.\n\nSupposedly Junior has already had discussions about relocating to a sparsely populated western red state like Montana, establishing residence, and running for governor or Senate on the basis of his pedigree as a hunter, a MAGA bro, and, of course, a Trump. What comparable option does Ivanka have? The only way she\u2019d be viable in a Republican primary is if dad personally campaigned for her. And I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d have the same sway as an ex-president, to whom Republicans no longer feel they owe loyalty, as he would as an incumbent. Remember, he couldn\u2019t even get Luther Strange past Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate primary runoff a few years ago. Imagine him trying to get his glamorous centrist NYC-born-and-bred daughter elected in Wyoming or whatever.\n\nI think Don Jr could get elected to a statewide seat somewhere, but president? Listen: If a Trump apologist as hardcore as Lou Dobbs is reacting this way to \u201cdynasty\u201d talk, God only knows how mortified rank-and-file Republicans are at the idea.\n\nThis may be one of the dumbest things a campaign manager for a populist candidate ever said: Trump family building 'dynasty' for decades to come #MAGA #AmericaFirst #Dobbs https://t.co/7cvDLRUlje \u2014 Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) September 9, 2019\n\nPopulism and dynasty aren\u2019t as incompatible as they should be. The French went from revolution to the Bonaparte clan ruling much of Europe within 25 years. A cynic might even define populism as a movement among average people to secure for themselves the same pernicious privileges the elites enjoy, up to and including hereditary political power. Dobbs is kidding himself if he thinks MAGA Nation would reject a dynasty on principle.\n\nThe reason there won\u2019t be a Trump dynasty in practice is that Republicans will simply be too tired after Trump is gone to do this again. Not all of them: There\u2019ll always be voters who crave \u201cchaos incitement\u201d to soothe their feeling of disempowerment, but most GOPers just won\u2019t have the stomach for another four-year run of government Trump-style. The tweets; the endless personnel churn; the weird erratic \u201clet\u2019s invite the Taliban to Camp David\u201d nonsense; the impetuous policy shifts, like a trade war with China, that seem to follow no master plan \u2014 it\u2019s just too much. Righties will stick with Trump in 2020 because they\u2019re completely invested in him as the incumbent but they\u2019re not doing this again anytime soon with Don Jr, who, notwithstanding his stump skills, lacks dad\u2019s mystique as a celebrity and as some sort of master businessman. Who\u2019s to say that Don will even be the Trumpiest figure on the Republican landscape 10 years from now? You don\u2019t think Tucker Carlson could out-Trump him if he wanted to?\n\nDon\u2019s best shot as a national figure would be to MAGA his way into state office somewhere and then tone his Trumpiness way down. If he governed effectively in a relatively low-key way, he\u2019d have appeal to both the MAGA and potentially the non-MAGA wings of the party. (\u201cHe\u2019s like his dad, but coherent!\u201d) The problem there, though, is that dad\u2019s likely to be around for awhile sniping at people from the sidelines even if he doesn\u2019t get a second term. And if he doesn\u2019t, if he ends up losing his reelection bid after having lost the popular vote to Hillary three years ago, how valuable will the \u201cTrump\u201d political brand really be? George H.W. Bush won his term in a landslide and left office as a respected statesman. Trump will be reviled by the opposition forever when he goes and even many supporters on the right will have long since reached the point of fatigue from his antics.
