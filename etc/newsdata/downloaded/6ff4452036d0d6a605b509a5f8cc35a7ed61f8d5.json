That's why we want to send this message to everyone.\"\n\nOne man held a sign the read: \"Thank you Morey,\" with a red heart after Morey's name. Another sign read: \"No censorship in America\" and a third declared: \"Freedom is not FREE.\" Another man held a sign that said: \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,\" which are the exact words included in Morey's tweet.\n\nTram Ho helped organize the group and said the reason for putting it together was simple.\n\n\"We wanted to support the pro-Democracy movement in Hong Kong,\" she said. \"The NBA's Morey ... tweeted a benign tweet to support the (movement and) the Chinese government overreacted and tried to censor us and that's not right. So that brought me the idea that we would support ... the pro-democratic movement.\"\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly rebuked his GM after his tweet with a tweet saying that Morey does not speak for the team, but the damage was done. The Chinese Basketball Association, headed by former Rockets star Yao Ming, suspended its ties to the Rockets over the tweet. Events in China promoting a Lakers-Nets series were canceled, NBA media partner Tencent said it was evaluating its plans to cover the league and some Chinese corporations have suspended relationships with the NBA.", "description": "\"The NBA's Morey ... tweeted a benign tweet to support the (movement and) the Chinese government overreacted and tried to censor us and that's not right.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/rockets-2.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
