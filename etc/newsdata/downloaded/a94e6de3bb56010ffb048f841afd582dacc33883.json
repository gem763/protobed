This weekend, the European Tour will test various innovations at Wentworth as it seeks to rid golf of the curse of slow play.\n\nOnly Masters win could come close to Open triumph, says Shane Lowry Read more\n\n\u201cI think it [the plan] is a start,\u201d McIlroy said. On slow play, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not a great thing for our game. I don\u2019t want to single out particular people but I watched a lot of the Solheim Cup at the weekend and it was really slow.\n\n\u201cAs much as you want to sit there and watch and support the European girls, it\u2019s just hard not to get frustrated with it. I am a fan of golf and I want the best for the game, something has to be done.\u201d\n\nSolheim competitors were on track for six-hour rounds during the first two days of competition, a scenario skewed slightly because not many matches lasted 18 holes.\n\nMcIlroy said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard because there\u2019s different scenarios where you have to take your time. It was tough conditions up there. It was windy. But you know, something has to be done.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the US Open final, Rafa [Nadal] got a time clock violation on a really big serve. Like, at the end of the final of the US Open. So if they can do it then there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t. It\u2019s just a matter of enforcing it and being consistent with it.\u201d\n\nThere was a chance McIlroy would not have appeared at Wentworth this week had he stuck to a plan mooted at the end of last season not to rejoin the European Tour. The 30-year-old Northern Irishman relented in signing up before the May deadline after some advice was offered close to home.\n\n\u201cIt was my wife,\u201d McIlroy revealed. \u201cShe sort of said to me: \u2018What are you trying to do, or what sort of point are you trying to make?\u2019 My thing was, I knew I wasn\u2019t going to play in the Irish Open [this year] and the rule was that you have to play an extra two events if you don\u2019t play your home open. Keith Pelley [the European Tour chief executive] and I sat down and I said: \u2018Keith, I can\u2019t possibly do that.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just me. Henrik Stenson and Alex Noren and the guys from Sweden, the Swedish Open clashed with some of the FedEx Cup stuff. They were in a similar position, as well. Keith came back to me and said: \u2018OK, if we make a compromise where instead of playing two extra, you have to play three of these events, three of those Rolex Series Events a year.\u2019 I said: \u2018Done, 100% done.\u2019 Once we had that conversation, it was totally fine.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nAfter his most consistent career season on the PGA Tour, this is the first of five tournaments to close out McIlroy\u2019s 2019. This event is the first in respect of automatic qualifying for the European Ryder Cup team of 2020. Padraig Harrington, the captain, has now added Robert Karlsson as the first of what will become five assistants.\n\nHarrington will spend the first two rounds at Wentworth in the company of Viktor Hovland. The 22-year-old Norwegian has earned a formidable reputation when emerging in the US and now has a Ryder Cup debut in his sights. A draw alongside Harrington, needless to say, is no coincidence.\n\n\u201cThat would mean everything to be part of the team,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cI love college golf so much. Even though professional golf is really cool, I still think about the times that we had in college. There\u2019s nothing better than winning a tournament as a team, and hopefully one day I\u2019ll be part of a winning Ryder Cup team.\u201d", "description": "The golfer has called on his sport to follow the lead of tennis by implementing proper penalties for slow play", "authors": ["Ewan Murray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d55163fbbf5630c12675891c200ac5a175a4d79/0_230_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bdb7006963e61bad1e55c636b407a551", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
