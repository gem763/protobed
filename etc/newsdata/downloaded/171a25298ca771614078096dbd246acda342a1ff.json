NASA will live-stream the outing beginning at 6:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe astronauts will replace a \"battery charge/discharge unit\" that failed Oct. 11, after new lithium-ion batteries were installed during a previous spacewalk. The malfunction hasn't jeopardized the safety of the crew, the space station or any of the onboard experiments, according to NASA.\n\nSpace\n\nThe all-female spacewalk will be the second of what NASA has called a \"spacewalk bonanza,\" with 10 outings scheduled through December. Three other spacewalks that had been planned for this week and next week have been postponed, according to the agency.\n\nOriginally, NASA had planned an all-female spacewalk in March. But that outing \u2014 which was to have involved Koch and NASA astronaut Anne McClain \u2014 was scrapped because there weren't enough spacesuits of the right size available on the station.\n\nNASA caught flak for the circumstances surrounding that cancellation. \"Gotta love the irony that because women have never spacewalked together before there aren't enough suits so the spacewalk can't happen,\" one Twitter user said at the time. \"What a joke.\"\n\nThis will be Meir's first spacewalk and Koch's fourth.\n\nWant more stories about space?\n\nSign up for the MACH newsletter and follow NBC News MACH on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "Astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir will perform an urgent repair to the International Space Station's power system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4236198/1000x563_nbc-191015-jessica-meir-christina-koch-cs-203p_7a638a036b6ff5217bf09ba951dddee7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
