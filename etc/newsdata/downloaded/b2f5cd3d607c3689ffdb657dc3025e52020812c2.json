That's fascism,' he said, referring Daily Mail Australia to comments he had given to SBS.\n\nMr Vickers said he did not 'celebrate or condone' Nazism.\n\nVickers & Hoad's website lists a range of Nazi-era items, including a German Third Reich era Luftwaffe officer's dagger (pictured) - listed with a reserve price of $300 to $500\n\n'I'm definitely not a Nazi, my mother was a German Jew,' he said.\n\nVickers & Hoad's website lists a range of Nazi-era items, including a German Third Reich era Luftwaffe officer's dagger with scabbard - listed with a reserve price of $300 to $500.\n\nA fish serving fork and lifter, each marked with Nazi Swastika, were expected to fetch $20 to $30.\n\nA set of six soup spoons, each marked with SS runic symbol, were tipped to go for $50 to $60.\n\nAn embroided pink, Nazi-era banner on a stand was listed for $80 to $100.\n\nTwo German army Nazi-era canvas ration bags were expected to be sold for a similar price.\n\nA set of six soup spoons, each marked with SS runic symbol, are tipped to go for $50 to $60\n\nDvir Abramovich, the chairman of the Anti-Defamation Commission a Jewish group, called on Vickers & Hoad to cancel the auction, scheduled for next week.\n\n'Such auctions violate the memory of the victims, hurt the survivors and dishonour the enormous sacrifices made by the diggers who fought to defeat the Third Reich,' he said.\n\nDr Abramovich was concerned such an auction would glorify German dictator Adolf Hitler - who masterminded the death of six million Jews, including 1.5million children.\n\n'These satanic items, the embodiment of absolute inhumanity, could have been used by those who committed the barbaric slaughter of millions, and may end up in hands of Hitler worshippers who will proudly hang the banner it in their lounge or obscenely use the cutlery,' he said.\n\n'I wonder whether auctioneers ever pause to think about the 1.5 million children murdered, about the emaciated figures staring from barbed wire, the mothers clutching their infants as they were pushed into the gas chambers, the crematoriums in Auschwitz, the death marches and the mobile killing units.'", "description": "Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, whose mother was born in a Hungarian refugee camp in 1943, has condemned a Sydney auction house for selling Nazi-era memorabilia with Swastikas on them.", "authors": ["Stephen Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/06/20021664-0-image-a-38_1571723393092.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
