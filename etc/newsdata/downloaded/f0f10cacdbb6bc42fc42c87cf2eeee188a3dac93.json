This week, we\u2019re featuring instrumental electronic, hip-hop, and jazz duo Big Gigantic.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusually humid day in Chicago when The Verge meets saxophonist / producer Dom Lalli and drummer Jeremy Salken, otherwise known as Big Gigantic. This would normally be a boring detail, but we\u2019re backstage at a festival, the pair is about to go onstage, and this weather means Dom is being extra cautious about his saxophone\u2019s reed. The reed is a small strip of wood attached to the sax\u2019s mouthpiece, and, like all wooden things, it absorbs moisture. So if you\u2019re constantly touring, hopping from plane to plane and climate to climate, it can be a touchy thing. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst part about playing saxophone,\u201d Dom laughs as he inspects a fresh pack of reeds. Jeremy, meanwhile, appears to be in his own world, intently drumming on a nearby table at a brisk pace using practice sticks topped with rubber.\n\nThe Colorado-based duo is known for genre-less hits that blend funk, hip-hop, jazz, and various types of electronic music into woozy, psychedelic swirls of sound. Their large back catalog includes collaborations with names like Logic, Rozes, and Waka Flocka Flame. Live, this translates into a massive audio-sensory experience that blends their tracks along with covers while Jeremy helms drums and Dom is on sax. Big Gigantic travels the world performing this electronic / live hybrid, and, on occasion, they ramp things up even further with their annual \u201cRowdytown\u201d show. Last year\u2019s brought a 3D experience to Los Angeles with graphics that included everything from giant floating astronauts to an animated Cardi B head.\n\nThis week, they\u2019ve released a new single called \u201cYou\u2019re The One,\u201d featuring singer Nevve. It\u2019s a beautiful, chord-forward song about self-love and finding happiness that crests into an explosion of horn melodies. Along with the single, Big Gigantic also announced that their Rowdytown show is coming to New York for the first time ever on August 23rd at The Brooklyn Mirage \u2014 with the immersive 3D setup.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s a lot on the table for Big Gigantic, figuratively and literally, as we\u2019ve made them dump out their things for a look-see. Along with those reeds and drumsticks, there\u2019s a good amount of cabling and even more THC-related products. Get on their groove, below.\n\nWhy do you have a Tumi bag?\n\nDom: Because my wife\u2019s the best! She was like, \u201chappy birthday,\u201d and I was like, \u201cfuck yes!\u201d She gets me.\n\nI hear your wife is responsible for a good portion of your travel items.\n\nJeremy: Happy wife, happy life!\n\nAny story behind this water bottle?\n\nJeremy: That\u2019s a Big Gigantic water bottle we gave out at Red Rocks the other year. I drink a lot of water. Got to stay hydrated. I\u2019m also big on having a water bottle pocket on my backpack. I literally buy bags based on that. Some people don\u2019t care, but I\u2019m big on that. It\u2019s a deal-breaker.\n\nWho do the glasses belong to?\n\nJeremy: They\u2019re both mine. I have two sets of glasses because I always break or lose them on tour or at festivals. I always bring a second pair so I\u2019m not blind.\n\nYou don\u2019t have contacts?\n\nJeremy: No, I can\u2019t do contacts. They dry my eyes out.\n\nUm, what\u2019s this little canister?\n\nJeremy: The iRoller! I found it at a random gas station in Colorado. It flips open and has a sticky surface that cleans your laptop or your phone screen. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s better than a cloth.\n\nAnd here come the cables.\n\nDom: Those are my cables and my Apple Watch charger.\n\nDo you text and take calls on your Watch often?\n\nDom: Yeah. Yeah, I do.\n\nJeremy: You do? You\u2019ll be like, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up, dude?\u201d [Holds wrist up to face]\n\nDom: I use it when I go to the gym. I like that I don\u2019t have to take anything else. I\u2019ll use the automated responses if someone texts me. I\u2019ll write out responses on the Watch, too. It works really well! And it has Apple Pay and works with my Air Pods, so I don\u2019t need the phone.\n\nJeremy: Can you check into the gym with it, or do you have a gym card?\n\nDom: Yep, I can check into the gym with my Watch.\n\nJeremy: Wow. I have to have my phone. I got a Tesla, and your phone is the key. There is an actual key, like a fob, but to use that, you have to touch it to the car, and it\u2019s annoying. So I never take the key out. It\u2019s always in my wallet. But using my phone isn\u2019t always reliable for the Tesla because it uses Bluetooth. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t connect.\n\nWhat about phones? Who has what?\n\nDom: My phone is the iPhone 7 Plus.\n\nJeremy: I have the X.\n\nWhy did you not upgrade, Dom?\n\nDom: I don\u2019t know. I hate my phone.\n\nWhy?\n\nDom: Let me clarify. The phone is fine. It\u2019s that, in general, everything about the phone takes me to a weird place. I\u2019m old-school. I like to be in the moment with people. I like paying attention. So I haven\u2019t upgraded my phone because I don\u2019t care enough about it.\n\nAnd what in-ears do each of you have?\n\nJeremy: My in-ears are by Sensaphonics. These in-ears are great for playing drums because they have little baby microphones on the outside of them that I can control from a pack. So I can control the volume of ambient noise coming in and actually hear what\u2019s going on around me. I can mix my environment with what is in my ears. It\u2019s super helpful for drums, and a lot of vocalists use them. The bummer is that I have to wear the pack.\n\nDom: My in-ears are by 64 Audio. It\u2019s a newer brand. I got them because my monitor tech recommended them to me. I respect a tech\u2019s opinion.\n\nI see a vape pen here.\n\nJeremy: This is a PAX oil vape pen. It\u2019s CBD and THC. The ratio is 3 to 1 so it doesn\u2019t get you too high, which is nice because when I get too high, I get anxiety and it sucks. So that\u2019s the main reason I use this. The strain I have in here is by a company called Mary\u2019s Medicinals out of Colorado.\n\nAnd, of course, there are drumsticks!\n\nJeremy: Those are the Vic Firth Corpsmaster drumsticks. They\u2019re for practicing, so they\u2019re really thick and really heavy so it helps build endurance. And they have a bouncy rubber tip.\n\nI don\u2019t play drums. Why do you need a practice set like this versus what you would use on stage?\n\nJeremy: These are like weight training for drums. When you practice with something that\u2019s heavier, you get used to that weight, so then when you go use regular drumsticks, they feel super light. You feel like Superman all of a sudden. It\u2019s like walking around with ankle weights all day and then taking them off.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a piece of your sax, Dom.\n\nDom: That\u2019s a mouthpiece for the saxophone. And then I have reeds. A reed is a little piece of wood. You just get it wet, line it up, and boom. I can use one for two or three shows. It\u2019s wood, so it\u2019s finicky. If I change altitudes, that affects it a lot. It\u2019s humid here, but then when I go home to Colorado, the reed will dry out in half a day. It\u2019s the worst part about playing the saxophone. Everything else is great.\n\nHow many of these mouthpieces do you have to carry with you?\n\nDom: Just one usually, but lately I\u2019ve been playing between two different ones. It depends on the reed. I have one that\u2019s better if it\u2019s a little softer and one that\u2019s better if it\u2019s a little bit harder. That way, if one is playing better than another, I\u2019m always ready when we\u2019re traveling.\n\nWhat\u2019s this lip balm?\n\nDom: Oh, I don\u2019t know. My wife finds this stuff. She\u2019s all about skin products. But lip balm is super essential for saxophone playing. My lips get chapped like [snaps] that. I have tons of lip balm. The brand doesn\u2019t really matter. I just need to always have something.\n\nI\u2019m surprised because I feel like most people who are super into lip balm have a brand they\u2019re loyal to.\n\nDom: Well, there is one that I really like. It\u2019s dope, dope, dope. It\u2019s by Glossier and smells like mint chocolate chip. And if you have a little extra, you can use it on your elbows!\n\nWhat\u2019s this little packet?\n\nDom: Rolling papers.\n\nJeremy: For weed.\n\nDom: And actually, if you have sticky pads, you can stick one of these guys underneath the pad and then close the pad and then pull it out, and it un-sticks it.\n\nI\u2019m going to pretend like I know what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nDom: Oh, for my saxophone. The keys. So if one of the keys is sticky and won\u2019t open up and close, you can stick a rolling paper in between, close it, and then pull the rolling paper out.\n\nBecause it absorbs the oil?\n\nDom: Yeah, exactly.\n\nWhat strain of weed is in this little container?\n\nDom: This is called the Deadhead OG. It\u2019s from a shop called 14er in Boulder. I like to try a lot of different stuff. This one, in particular, I\u2019m not really partial to. I do like some indica on the road. It\u2019s nice for when you need to go to sleep or just relax.\n\nDoes TSA ever stop you?\n\nDom: No, but if they did, I might get in trouble. But they have never stopped me out of the hundreds of times I\u2019ve done it. They\u2019re not looking for it. But don\u2019t fly internationally with it. Wouldn\u2019t recommend that.", "description": "The Colorado-based duo is known for genre-less hits that blend funk, hip-hop, jazz, and various electronic genres into woozy, psychedelic swirls of sound.
