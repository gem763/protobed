Hilton called for pass interference while not doing anything against Chiefs", "language": "en", "text": "Indianapolis Colts wide receiver T.Y. Hilton was called for offensive pass interference on Sunday night in their 19-13 win against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium, though he didn\u2019t exactly do anything.\n\nHe was just standing there.\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Colts successfully converted a third down to start the fourth quarter after Jacoby Brissett found tight end Jack Doyle for a 12-yard gain. Hilton, who was lined up on the left side of the field, took a step inside to set a block on Colts safety Tyrann Mathieu for Doyle, who slipped outside and had plenty of room to grab the first down.\n\nHilton, though, was flagged for offensive pass interference despite being within just one yard of the line of scrimmage, not initiating contact with Mathieu whatsoever and having both hands in the air while standing straight up and down.\n\nHilton \u2014 who finished the night with four receptions for 37 yards \u2014 really couldn\u2019t have done less if he tried.\n\nNaturally, Colts coach Frank Reich tried to challenge the pass interference call \u2014 a new rule in the league this season.\n\nThe play, though, was upheld, sending the Colts back 10 yards to attempt the third-down conversion yet again.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Colts ended up converting the first down anyway, though they had to go for it on fourth down after the call was upheld. They were eventually stopped on third down nine plays and had to settle for a field goal, which put them up 16-10 midway through the fourth quarter. Had the penalty not been thrown in the first place, or been properly overturned, who knows how that drive would have ended up.\n\nRegardless, things worked out for Indianapolis in the end. Still, it\u2019s hard to pick up a flag when not doing anything on the field.\n\nFans slam the call on social media\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for fans to flock to social media to complain about the call, and yet another failed pass interference challenge, either.\n\n\u201cOffensive pass interference on 13\u201d pic.twitter.com/M1z2B6T3qd \u2014 Daurice Fountain (@Reece_JMM) October 7, 2019\n\nWill these coaches learn by Thanksgiving that they're going to lose every pass interference challenge? \u2014 Ryan Glasspiegel (@sportsrapport) October 7, 2019\n\nRaise your hand if you don't really understand what pass interference is these days. pic.twitter.com/gvadsGxNuN \u2014 Tyler Greever (@WIBWTyler) October 7, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t know what pass interference is.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what a catch is.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know. \u2014 Jack Korte (@JackMyNBC5) October 7, 2019\n\nIf that\u2019s offensive pass interference I have never seen a football game \u2014 Evan Longoria (@Evan3Longoria) October 7, 2019\n\nWhy aren\u2019t you overturning obvious mistakes on pass interference calls?\n\nNFL referees: pic.twitter.com/d6MOEKv9V7 \u2014 DL (@davelozo) October 7, 2019\n\n\"Remember when everyone was mad about not knowing what a catch is?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah that was awesome.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let's do it again but for pass interference.\" \u2014 Will Brinson (@WillBrinson) October 7, 2019\n\nOffensive pass interference where you never initiate any contact.
