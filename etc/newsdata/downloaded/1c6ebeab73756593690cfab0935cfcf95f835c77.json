EIA/S\n\nU.S. crude stocks fell 7.2 million barrels last week, more\n\nthan analysts' expectations for 2.7 million-barrel draw, data\n\nfrom industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed.\n\nOfficial figures will be released on Wednesday.\n\nTrump abruptly fired Bolton amid disagreements over how to\n\nhandle foreign policy challenges such as North Korea, Iran,\n\nAfghanistan and Russia. \"The market took that as a sign that the Trump\n\nadministration may become less hawkish on Iran, open the talks\n\nand the possibility of the return of Iranian oil,\" said Phil\n\nFlynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.\n\nIran's crude oil exports were slashed by more than 80% due\n\nto re-imposed sanctions by the United States after Trump exited\n\nlast year Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. In May,\n\nWashington ended sanction waivers given to importers of Iranian\n\noil, aiming to cut Tehran's exports to zero. The market was further pressured by the U.S. Energy\n\nInformation Administration's (EIA) lowering of its spot crude\n\noil price forecasts, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures\n\nat Mizuho.\n\nIn its latest monthly Short Term Energy Outlook, the EIA\n\nreduced its forecast for spot West Texas Intermediate crude\n\nprices for 2019 to an average of $56.31 per barrel from $57.87\n\nin its August report.\n\nThe EIA also reduced its forecast for spot Brent prices for\n\n2019 to an average of $63.39 per barrel from $65.15.\n\nOil prices were higher earlier in the session after Prince\n\nAbdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's new energy minister and a\n\nlongtime member of the Saudi delegation to OPEC and its allies,\n\nsaid the kingdom's policy would not change and a global deal to\n\ncut oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day would be\n\nmaintained. He added that the so-called OPEC+ alliance, which includes\n\nnon-OPEC producers such as Russia, would be in place for the\n\nlong term.\n\nThe OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee (JMMC),\n\nwhich reports on compliance with the cuts, is due to meet on\n\nThursday in Abu Dhabi.\n\nGoldman Sachs lowered its forecast on 2019 oil demand growth\n\nto 1 million bpd, down 100,000 bpd, but left its 2020 demand\n\ngrowth estimate broadly unchanged at 1.4 million bpd.\n\n\"Our oil supply-demand outlook for 2020 calls for additional\n\nOPEC production cuts to keep inventories near normal,\" Goldman\n\nanalysts wrote in a note.\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: U.S. crude inventories https://tmsnrt.rs/2y7mC9g\n\nCHART: U.S. oil may extend gains to $59.75 L3N2610NS\n\nCHART: Brent oil may rise to $64.57 L3N26104Q\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 9-Oil falls on possibility of Iran exports resuming after Trump fires hard-line adviser", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_4_800x533_L_1413112066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
