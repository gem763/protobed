He could go out and do various town halls, he could lead the caucus on his coattails,\" said Delacourt, national columnist and Ottawa bureau chief for the Toronto Star.\n\n\"That has flipped upside down now.\"\n\nThe Liberals won 157 seats in Monday's federal election, and are expected to form a minority government. The Conservatives won the popular vote, but finished with 121 seats. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois finished with 32; the NDP with 24, the Green with three.\n\nDelacourt told The Current's interim host Laura Lynch that Trudeau will need to learn about caucus management, and how to quietly make deals with people.\n\nNeither of those have been his strength in the past, she said.\n\nWatch results from our Canada Votes election night special. 23:46\n\n\"He has to like the House of Commons, or at least stay there more than he has,\" she added.\n\n\"He didn't like it in opposition, he doesn't like it in government \u2014 but the House of Commons is where his power lies.\"\n\nThe prime minister \"says that he is a learner,\" she told Lynch.\n\n\"He's going to be doing some on-the-job learning in the next weeks and months.\"\n\nTo discuss the challenges \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 facing the next government, Lynch spoke to:\n\nSusan Delacourt, national columnist and Ottawa bureau chief for the Toronto Star .\n\nMarie Vastel, parliamentary correspondent for Le Devoir.\n\nMurray Mandryk, political columnist for the Regina Leader Post.\n\nListen to the full conversation near the top of this page.\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
