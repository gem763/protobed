To verify a financial planner's credentials, consult the CFP Board directory.\n\nWhat does a financial planner do?\n\nA good financial planner should be able to offer guidance on every aspect of your financial situation, including setting up a retirement saving and investing strategy; planning for big expenses, like buying a house or having kids; everyday budgeting and spending; plus tax and estate planning.\n\nSome financial planners specialize in specific areas, like wealth management or retirement planning. Others may prefer to work with younger or older clients, or people in certain professions. Notably, a financial planner can be beneficial to you regardless of your income level.\n\nHow much does a financial planner cost?\n\nFinancial planners typically charge a flat fee, hourly fee, or if they're handling your investments, an asset under management fee equal to between 1% and 3% of your total assets.\n\nIf you're meeting once or twice to create a financial plan or get advice, you can expect to pay anywhere between $100 and $300 an hour. If you're looking for access to an adviser on a rolling basis \u2014 i.e. you want help implementing and maintaining your financial plan \u2014 you may pay a fixed fee, usually between $1,000 and $3,000.\n\nKeep in mind that prices vary and some financial planners offer customized packages that don't fall into any of the above categories. Many financial planners also offer introductory consultations for potential clients at no cost.\n\nWhat is the difference between fee-only and fee-based?\n\nFee-only only financial planners do not get paid commissions and they act as fiduciaries, meaning they are obligated to make decisions in their client's best interest. Their only objective is to provide sound financial advice to the client, who is paying them an hourly fee, flat retainer fee, or asset under management fee.\n\nImportantly, fee-only financial planners cannot accept kickbacks from insurance companies or brokerage firms if that's where their client chooses to put their money \u2014 that is a fee-based adviser.\n\nThis doesn't mean a fee-based financial adviser will necessarily work against your best interests. It only means that they may be more inclined to recommend products and services for which they get a commission, which may or may not be the best option for your financial planning needs.\n\nDo I need a financial planner?\n\nYou don't have to be earning six figures to meet with a financial planner, but you probably don't need one if you just want to know how to invest a few thousand dollars or which funds to choose in your retirement accounts.\n\nIf you want to examine your cash flow for ways to save more or implement better spending habits on a larger scale, a financial planner can help.\n\nYou may also consider hiring a financial planner if you're too overwhelmed or confused by your money to make big financial decisions, including how to balance multiple financial goals, manage a business, get out of crushing debt, or establish a retirement savings plan. If the alternative to meeting with a financial planner is decision paralysis, you're better off seeking outside advice.\n\nHow do I find a good financial planner?\n\nYou can search for financial planners in your area using resources like SmartAsset's free SmartAdvisor tool, the XY Planning Network, and The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors.\n\nOnce you've found a financial planner to meet with, there are a few important questions you can ask to find out if they're the right person to handle your money, including (but not limited to) the following:", "description": "Everything you need to know about financial planners: what to look for, how much they cost, what they can help with, and whether you need one.", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5f8decc4a0a756d544588?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
