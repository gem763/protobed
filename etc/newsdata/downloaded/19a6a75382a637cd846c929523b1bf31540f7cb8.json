There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries but a swarm of aftershocks were reported.\n\nThe 6.4 magnitude quake struck at 10:33 a.m. in the Mojave Desert, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, near the town of Ridgecrest, California. It is the strongest quake to hit the region in 20 years.\n\nThe United State Geological Survey initially said it measured at a 6.6 magnitude.\n\n\u201cIt almost gave me a heart attack,\u201d said Cora Burke, a waitress at Midway Cafe in Ridgecrest, a town of 28,000 people. \u201cIt\u2019s just a rolling feeling inside the building, inside the cafe and all of a sudden everything started falling off the shelf, glasses, the refrigerator and everything in the small refrigerator fell over.\u201d\n\nVideo posted online of a liquor store in Ridgecrest showed the aisles filled with broken wine and liquor bottles, knocked down boxes and other groceries strewn on the floor.\n\nRidgecrest, California, Mayor Peggy Breeden says firefighters are working to put out five fires in the area following an earthquake but that she didn\u2019t know if any injuries have been reported.\n\nBreeden tells CNN utility workers are assessing broken gas lines and turning off gas where necessary.\n\nBreeden says the local senior center was holding a Fourth of July event when the quake hit. She says everyone made it out shaken up but without injuries.\n\nVeteran seismologist Lucy Jones said the earthquake Thursday was the strongest to hit Southern California in 20 years.\n\nThe previous large quake was a 7.1 on that struck in the area on October 16, 1999, she said.\n\nJones told reporters at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, that the 6.4 quake centered in the Mojave Desert near the town of Ridgecrest was preceded by a magnitude 4.3 temblor about a half hour earlier.\n\nShe says it was vigorous aftershock sequence occurring and that she wouldn\u2019t be surprise if a magnitude 5 quake occurred during the aftershocks.\n\n\u201cWe should be expecting lots of aftershocks,\u201d she said.\n\nPeople from Las Vegas to the Pacific Coast reported feeling a rolling motion and took to social media to report it.\n\nLocal emergency agencies also took to social media to ask people to only call 911 for emergencies.\n\n\u201cWe are very much aware of the significant earthquake that just occurred in Southern California. Please DO NOT call 9-1-1 unless there are injuries or other dangerous conditions. Don\u2019t call for questions please,\u201d the LAPD said in a statement published on Twitter.\n\nAshleigh Chandler, a helicopter rescue EMT at Fort Irwin, California, said the quake happened as she was getting ready for a July 4th party.\n\n\u201cI was just in the living room getting everything ready, we start to feel the shaking, so then I look up and then the wine bottles start rattling and I thought, \u2018They\u2019re going to fall.\u2019\n\n\u201cMy stepson was in the house and my dog, so we just got everyone outside and then it ended. It was like 15, 20 seconds, maybe. It was pretty good shaking, so I\u2019m out of breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nRodriguez reported from San Francisco. Associated Press writer Rachel Lerman in San Francisco and AP Radio reporter Shelly Adler in Washington, D.C., contributed.\n\nThe quote in the story from Ashleigh Chandler has been corrected to say stepson, not sister.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A strong earthquake rattled a large swath of Southern California and parts of Nevada on Thursday morning, making hanging lamps sway and photo frames on walls shake.
