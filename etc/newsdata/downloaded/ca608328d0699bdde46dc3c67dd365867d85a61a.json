I expect these have never been seen since 1965.\"", "description": "A four-minute long film, worth \u00a310,000, was found during a house clearance in Wales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C92C/production/_109000515_gettyimages-73989136.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
