Fans at SunTrust Park raise the tomahawks and thrust them forward in a chopping motion, led by music and graphics on the video boards.\n\nThe Braves said they removed the tomahawks for the final game of their series with St. Louis after Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley said he finds the chant insulting. Helsley is a member of the Cherokee Nation. He\u2019s one of only a few Native Americans in the majors.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,\u201d Helsley told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch during the Braves-Cardinals series.\n\n\u201cJust depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren\u2019t intellectual,\u201d Helsley said. \u201cThey are a lot more than that. It\u2019s not me being offended by the whole mascot thing. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about the misconception of us, the Native Americans, and it devalues us and how we\u2019re perceived in that way, or used as mascots. The Redskins and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nThe National Football League\u2019s Washington Redskins have also faced continuing criticism for its nickname, which critics say denigrates Native Americans. Fans of the NFL\u2019s Kansas City Chiefs have also done the tomahawk chant in their stadium, drawing more criticism.\n\nThe chant has been a part of the Braves\u2019 tradition since it was borrowed from Florida State University in the early 1990s.\n\n\u201cIt reduces Native Americans to a caricature and minimizes the contributions of Native peoples as equal citizens and human beings,\u201d Muscogee (Creek) Nation Principal Chief James Floyd said in a statement to the Atlanta newspaper.\n\nThe leader of the North Carolina-based Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians expressed similar sentiments. Principal Chief Richard Sneed says he has no problem with the team\u2019s name, but that it\u2019s time to stop the tomahawk chop.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just so stereotypical, like old-school Hollywood,\u201d Chief Sneed said. \u201cLet\u2019s move on. Find something else.\u201d\n\nAsked about the long-term future of the chant, Braves spokeswoman Beth Marshall referred to the team\u2019s earlier statements.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to evaluate how we activate elements of our brand, as well as the overall in-game experience,\u201d said a statement issued on the day of the Braves\u2019 season-ending Game 5 defeat. \u201cWe look forward to a continued dialogue with those in the Native American community after the postseason concludes.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Atlanta Braves officials say they plan to have talks with Native Americans about the Tomahawk Chop chant that has drawn complaints and stoked controversy during the Major League Baseball post-season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
