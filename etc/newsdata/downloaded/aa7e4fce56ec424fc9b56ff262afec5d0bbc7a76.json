remains in the EU after 31 October it will have to name a candidate for the new European Commission due to take over on 1 December.\n\nBoris Johnson has continued to insist that it is still possible for the UK to leave by Halloween, if the EU reject a further extension.\n\nHowever the prime minister is now said to be preparing to force a snap general election before Christmas.\n\nIf his call for a 12 December election is voted down by MPs on Monday, Downing Street has indicated it is considering introducing a bill to trigger a poll on 9 December.\n\nThe idea was proposed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, who joined forces to write a letter to Mr Tusk asking for a three-month extension.\n\nIt led to accusations that Jo Swinson\u2019s party had \u201cgiven up\u201d on securing a Final Say referendum on Brexit.", "description": "The EU is planning to give the UK a Brexit extension until 31 January, with an option to leave earlier if a deal is passed by parliament, according to
