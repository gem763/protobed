She is pictured outside the court\n\nShe told depute fiscal Vish Kathuria: 'She was very quiet, in fact both of the children were quiet and seemed withdrawn which I thought was quite unusual.\n\n'One night she asked to speak to me and was quite nervous. She said she had a secret to tell me and she told me Samantha used to play with her flower.\n\n'I was really upset and we both started crying and later she told her dad about what had happened and he got quite angry and upset about it.'\n\nShe also told how the boy also told her he was a victim of abuse.\n\nShe said: 'He told me in 2017 and again he was really quiet and withdrawn. He told me what had happened earlier had also been happening to him.\n\n'He ran away after telling us about what had happened and the police got involved then.'\n\nSmith told defence advocate Kelly Duling she was innocent and was 'elated' to be in court to clear her name.\n\nHamilton Sheriff Court (above) heard Smith express she 'wasn't a monster' she also said she was horrified to have been accused of the abuse\n\nShe added: 'I have not done anything wrong.\n\n'The first I heard about this was when the police came to the house. I'm horrified to be accused of these things.\n\n'I'm actually elated at the thought of being in court to clear my name over this.\n\n'I didn't abuse them, I am not some horrible monster that I'm being made out to be here.'\n\nSheriff Douglas Brown deferred sentence on Smith until next month for reports and continued bail.\n\nShe was placed on the sex offenders' register.", "description": "Samantha Smith repeatedly preyed on a three-year-old girl and a five-year-old boy for two years at a property in East Kilbride, Scotland.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/12/19738278-0-image-a-71_1571139520221.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
