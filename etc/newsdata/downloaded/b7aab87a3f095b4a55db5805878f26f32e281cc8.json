(the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cTorex\u201d) (TSX: TXG) reports the Company\u2019s financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.\n\nFred Stanford, President & CEO of Torex, stated:\n\n\u201cFrom every perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Safety performance continued to be outstanding with zero lost time injuries in the quarter. Record gold production of 138,145 ounces was more than 20% higher than the previous record set earlier in the year. Plant throughput increased in each month of the quarter, both in terms of tonnes per hour and number of hours operated. Throughput averaged 12,380 tpd in the quarter, 6% higher than the previous quarter, including 13,561 tpd in September. The mines continued the strong performance demonstrated throughout the year, with an average of 15,391 tpd of ore mined in the quarter. Total cash costs in the quarter were $561 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs were $675 per ounce. As would be expected, the production and cost performance, aided by the rising gold price, resulted in excellent quarterly earnings of $0.32 per share ($0.36 per share adjusted) and excellent cash flow from operations of over $120 million ($82 million before changes in non-cash working capital). Q4 is well set up to bring in a strong finish to the year. With production and costs tracking to expectations, guidance is maintained.\n\n\u201cWith power to the SAG mill motor being the limiting factor, we are targeting average steady-state throughput of 13,000 tpd in the processing plant on a go forward basis. With the potential of Media Luna on the horizon as an 8,000 tpd operation, it does not make sense to invest capital for a higher capacity SAG mill motor to achieve the original design specification of 14,000 tpd. Continuous improvement initiatives to maximize plant throughput will be ongoing.\n\n\u201cOn the Muckahi front, a patent application has been submitted and acknowledged. The Muckahi Mining System now has \u2018patent pending\u2019 status. We are now ready to move beyond testing the components individually and will commence testing the components as an integrated system. The ELD deposit has been dedicated to this purpose. Blasting and slusher mucking of the first long hole open stope is scheduled to begin in November. Two steep ramps to access the lower reaches of the deposit have been laid out and excavation of those will also begin in November. In the corporate office, work is accelerating to develop the support systems required to commercially leverage what could potentially be an industry disruptive technology.\u201d\n\nThis release should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s September 30, 2019 Financial Statements and MD&A on the Company\u2019s website or on SEDAR.\n\nQ3 2019 HIGHLIGHTS\n\nOperational results\n\nRecord gold production of 138,145 ounces.\n\nof 138,145 ounces.

The Company\u2019s principal assets are the El Lim\u00f3n Guajes mining complex (\u201cELG\u201d or the \u201cELG Mine Complex\u201d), comprised of the El Lim\u00f3n, Guajes and El Lim\u00f3n Sur open pits, the El Lim\u00f3n Guajes underground mine including zones referred to as Sub-Sill and El Lim\u00f3n Deep (\u201cELD\u201d), and the processing plant and related infrastructure, which is in the commercial production stage as of April 1, 2016, and the Media Luna deposit, which is an early stage development project, and for which the Company issued an updated preliminary economic assessment in September 2018 (the \u201cTechnical Report\u201d). The property remains 75% unexplored.\n\nFor further information, please contact: TOREX GOLD RESOURCES INC.

It is important to note that Muckahi is experimental in nature and has not been tested in an operating mine. Many aspects of the system are conceptual, and proof of concept has not been demonstrated. Drill and blast fundamentals, standards and best practices for underground hard rock mining are applied in the Muckahi, where applicable. The proposed application of a monorail system for underground transportation for mine development and production mining is unique to underground hard rock mining. There are existing underground hard rock mines that use a monorail system for transportation of materials and equipment, however not in the capacity described in the Technical Report. Aspects of Muckahi mining equipment are currently in the design and test stage. The mine design, equipment performance and cost estimations are conceptual in nature, and do not demonstrate technical or economic viability. The Company expects to complete the development and test the concept by the end of 2019 for the mine development and production activities. Further studies would be required to verify the viability of Muckahi.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. Notwithstanding the Company's efforts, there can be no guarantee that the Company will not face unforeseen delays or disruptions of its operations including without limitation, delays caused by blockades limiting access to the ELG Mine Complex and the Media Luna Project or by blockades or trespassers impacting the Company\u2019s ability to operate. Forward-looking information also includes, but is not limited to, expectation that the Company performance in the fourth quarter will bring in a strong finish to 2019, production and cost tracking to expectations to achieve guidance, targeting average steady state throughput of 13,000 t/day in the processing plant on go forward basis, the potential of Media Luna to be brought into production and run at 8,000 t/day, plans to continue improvement initiatives to maximize plant throughput with the current SAG mill motor capacity, plans to move the new mining technology (Muckahi) to testing the system as an integrated mining method, including without limitation, the testing of the tramming conveyor, fragmentation and mucking with a slusher, plans to mine the El Lim\u00f3n Deep deposit using Muckahi, including without limitation, the excavation of two steep ramps to access the lower part of the deposit, plans to develop the support systems required to commercially leverage Muckahi, and the potential for Muckahi to be an industry disruptive technology.

Ore mined from the ELG Underground (defined in the MD&A) of 102 kt and 302 kt is included in ore tonnes mined and excluded from the strip ratio in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018, ore mined from the ELG Underground (defined in the MD&A) was 117 kt, 83 kt, 67 kt and 38 kt, respectively. Current liabilities at June 30, 2019 included a scheduled repayment of $75.0 million in June 2020 under the 2017 Revolving Facility (defined in the MD&A). As a result of the refinancing, the $75.0 million due under the 2017 Revolving Facility is no longer required. Included within ore in stockpile is 0.6 mt of long term, low grade inventory, with a carrying value of nil at September 30, 2019. As at June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018, the long term, low grade inventory was 0.5 mt, 0.2 mt, 0.1 mt and nil, respectively, with nil carrying value. As at September 30, 2019 the long term, low grade inventory has an average grade of 0.85 gpt. Sum of the quarters may not add to the year to date amounts due to rounding.\n\n\n\n", "description": "(All amounts expressed in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise stated)", "authors": ["Torex Gold Resources Inc."], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/507434?filename=507434.png&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
