US prosecutors watered down early allegations that she was an operative of Russia's intelligence agencies, and described her only as funded by senior politician Torshin.\n\nBut they maintained that she had a mission to infiltrate US political circles in an operation to \"spot and assess\" potential espionage targets.\n\nPart of that involved becoming the live-in girlfriend of a mid-level Republican operative who sponsored her as a graduate student at American University in Washington.\n\n\"There is no doubt that she was not simply a graduate student,\" Assistant US Attorney Erik Kenerson told the court.\n\nBut Butina maintained that, guided by Torshin, she genuinely sought to create people-to-people channels of cooperation and fell victim to a higher level of intrigue relating to Russian election interference.\n\nShe told NPR radio from jail that, while a graduate student in politics at American University, she had only sought to be involved in \"civil diplomacy.\"\n\n\"I never hide my love to my motherland neither to this country... I love both countries, and I was building peace.\"\n\n- Spy swap? -\n\nHer future in Russia remained unknown. There was some speculation that Moscow's arrest of an American, Paul Whelan, last December for alleged espionage was a tit for tat and that her release could lead to his.\n\nBut Whelan's brother David told AFP this week that it appeared Moscow could want much more in return for Paul Whelan's release, including a possible swap for other US-jailed spies and the reopening of two Russian-leased estates in New York and Maryland that were forced closed in 2017 in retaliation for Russian election meddling.\n\nNevertheless, Whelan tweeted on Friday: \"I wish the very best for Ms. Butina and much joy for her reunion with her family. We look forward to the same opportunity with Paul in the future.\"", "description": "Maria Butina, the Russian gun advocate who built a network of high-level Republican contacts before being arrested for spying, was freed from US prison Friday after serving nine months, the Bureau of Prisons said.
