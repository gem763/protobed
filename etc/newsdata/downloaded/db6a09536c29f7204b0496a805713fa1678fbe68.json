The last charge related to a cache of cash discovered at the farm.\n\nOn Tuesday, a 58-year-old man who paid the rent on the farmhouse was taken into custody on similar charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have called in specialized help,\" police spokesman Anthony Hogeveen said on Friday, adding that more than four days after the discovery of the family, investigators were still in the dark about how the family ended up in the room.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary situation.
