REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File Photo\n\nThe plan filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco includes payments capped at $8.4 billion for wildfire victims, payments capped at $8.5 billion for reimbursing insurers that had paid victims and a $1 billion settlement with local governments.\n\nThe plan also would pay PG&E\u2019s debts in full and honor the company\u2019s contracts, including ones for buying renewable energy to help California meet its goals for cutting greenhouse emissions.\n\n\u201cUnder the plan we filed today, we will meet our commitment to fairly compensate wildfire victims and we will emerge from Chapter 11 financially sound and able to continue meeting California\u2019s clean energy goals,\u201d PG&E Chief Executive and President Bill Johnson said in a statement.\n\nSan Francisco-based PG&E sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January. At the time, the company expected more than $30 billion in liabilities from wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018, including November\u2019s Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire of the state\u2019s modern history.\n\nLawyer Michael Kelly of Walkup, Melodia, Kelly & Schoenberger in San Francisco said wildfire victims like those he represents, including victims of the Camp Fire, will find what the plan offers them to be too little.\n\nThey also will be stunned that PG&E did not propose sacrifices from its bondholders or shareholders, Kelly said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in any way, shape or form satisfactory or fair,\u201d Kelly told Reuters.\n\nPG&E must file a detailed reorganization plan by Sept. 29, the day its so-called exclusive period for filing a Chapter 11 plan expires.\n\nIf PG&E resolves its bankruptcy by the end of June 2020, it will be able to participate in a recently enacted, $21 billion state fund to help California\u2019s investor-owned utilities pay for future wildfires liabilities.\n\nThe utilities would help support the fund with contributions. PG&E has said that taking part in the fund will enhance its finances over the long term.\n\nAccording to the outline of its reorganization plan, PG&E will make a required $4.8 billion initial contribution to the fund.\n\nPG&E said in a statement it expects its plans will include substantial equity financing, which may include a rights offering to existing shareholders, and that it aims to raise $14 billion to help pay wildfire victims and pay into the state fund.\n\nCorporate reorganization plans generally need widespread support of creditors, and debtors can spend months getting the necessary backing.\n\nPG&E will ultimately need to win approval for a reorganization plan from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali, who has indicated he is willing to consider viable plans from other parties.", "description": "California power provider PG&E Corp on Monday unveiled the outlines of a reorganization plan that will pay $17.9 billion for claims stemming from the wildfires that pushed it to seek bankruptcy protection.", "authors": ["Jim Christie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428128162&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8900I", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
