Susan Collins in 2020.\n\nMore than 3,700 Mainers donated to Gideon\u2019s campaign and nearly 97% of all contributions were less than $100, according to her campaign.\n\nCollins\u2019 campaign has not yet released her third-quarter 2019 fundraising totals. In the previous quarter, she raised $2 million in mostly out-of-state donations. Just 1.3% of her total haul came from people who gave $200 or less.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful to the supporters who joined our team in the first few months of this campaign,\u201d Gideon said in a statement.\n\nThough she has a record of accepting corporate PAC money in her state-level career, Gideon noted in Tuesday\u2019s statement that she has vowed not to accept those types of contributions for her Senate run.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for Senate because I believe that politicians in Washington are too responsive to special interests and their wealthy donors, and it\u2019s time for leadership that puts Maine first,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have such a strong grassroots team.\u201d\n\nGideon has received high-profile endorsements from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, NARAL and EMILY\u2019s List.\n\nWinning Maine is key for Democrats seeking to flip the Senate in 2020. Collins has faced intense backlash from Democrats and women\u2019s rights activists ever since she cast her pivotal vote last year to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite his anti-abortion views and the sexual misconduct allegations against him.\n\nAt least five Democrats have announced primary bids in Maine\u2019s Senate race, including Gideon; Betsy Sweet, a former Maine gubernatorial candidate and women\u2019s rights lobbyist; and attorney Bre Kidman. Two independent candidates \u2015 Tiffany Bond and Daniele VanHelsing \u2015 are also running.\n\nThe primary will take place on June 9, 2020.", "description": "Maine's House speaker is one of at least five Democrats aiming to run against the Republican senator in 2020.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da5e9fd210000510facf97c.jpeg?cache=afwmvqlryz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
