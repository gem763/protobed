That compared to an average price of only \u00a3132 for the same protection purchased directly from an insurer.\n\nEven the smallest disparity for Gap insurance was 102 per cent \u2013 for a Honda CR-V SUV that cost \u00a3415 from a dealership, but just \u00a3205 on average from an insurer directly.\n\nThe FCA reported earlier this year that it had found numerous examples of dealerships receiving high and potentially excessive levels of commission.\n\nThe average level of commission (after Insurance Premium Tax) taken by car dealerships when selling these policies was 71 per cent. It also found that car dealerships selling scratch and dent insurance were receiving an average commission of 54 per cent.\n\nThe FCA also found examples of Gap products being sold to ineligible customers who did not need the cover, prompting concerns about potential mis-selling.\n\nSome firms were found to be pushing the insurance through distributors where some or all of the vehicles being sold were second-hand, meaning the product was often unnecessary or of nearly no value.\n\nSince publishing its findings, the FCA has warned insurers not to allow dealerships to receive commission \u2018which bears no reasonable relationship to the costs or workload to distribute the product\u2019.\n\nAnd Which? found that disparities extended beyond Gap insurance.\n\nQuotes for cosmetic and dent insurance was almost 60 per cent lower from an insurer directly compared to a car dealership, while alloy wheel and tyre insurance was up to 26 per cent cheaper.\n\nJenny Ross, Editor of Which? Money, said: \u2018We\u2019re really concerned that car dealers are continuing to pocket huge commission fees from selling insurance products at rip-off prices, despite recent scrutiny from the financial regulator.\n\n'The FCA needs to keep a close eye on these practices and be ready to step in with strong action if consumers face mis-selling or unreasonable charges for these products.'", "description": "Anyone who has bought a new car in the last decade will know that salesmen will offer a range of additional cover products with the vehicle including Gap insurance and interior protection policies.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
