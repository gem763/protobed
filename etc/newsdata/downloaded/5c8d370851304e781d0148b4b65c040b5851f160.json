But the letter says the company put in \u00a320million in summer 2018 and is paying in \u00a340million-plus per year for the following four years.\n\nMy question is how can a layperson tell when to be worried about a final salary pension deficit? Do you need to be concerned at a 95 per cent funding level? What about 75 per cent? Or 55 per cent? Should you just relax unless a company is in financial trouble?\n\nPension concern: My old employer's final salary scheme has a deficit of several hundred million pounds - should I be worried? (Stock image)\n\nTanya Jefferies, of This is Money, replies: After high profile business collapses like BHS, Carillion and now Thomas Cook, it is understandable to wonder about the financial health of an old employer which is meant to provide a final salary pension in retirement.\n\nBut as we explained in the case of Thomas Cook, final salary pension schemes are safeguarded even if a firm goes bust.\n\nAt worst they get rescued by a lifeboat scheme, and any reductions to payouts are relatively low except for those due a very large pension.\n\nThat said, it makes sense to stay alert to any warning signs. We asked a final salary pensions expert at a specialist financial consultancy to explain what funding levels are typical, and whether to be concerned about the size of this deficit.\n\nPatrick Bloomfield, a partner at Hymans Robertson, replies: 'Is my final salary pension safe?' is a good question to ask, but it isn\u2019t something most people should lose any sleep over.\n\nPatrick Bloomfield: 'The average funding level for all pension schemes' valuations last year was 89 per cent'\n\nAs long as your old employer remains in business it is liable for your scheme paying your pension in full.\n\nIf the worst happens and your old employer goes out of business, your pension would normally be taken on by the Pension Protection Fund (the PPF).\n\nYou would get most of the pension you were expecting, but with some reductions.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s a 10 per cent reduction for people under their scheme\u2019s retirement age and the way pensions increase each year might be less generous than in your old scheme.\n\nThe PPF was set up in 2004 as a \u2018lifeboat\u2019 to protect final salary pension scheme members when a business becomes insolvent. This is paid for through the collection of a levy on companies with final salary pension schemes.\n\nBut, as I said at the start, this is the worst case scenario. Let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t happen and take a look at what you\u2019ve been told about your scheme\u2019s deficit.\n\nPension schemes hold assets in a trust, which is legally separate from the employer. This trust is run by trustees, who are also separate from your employer.\n\nEvery three years the trustees have to do a valuation, taking advice from a suitably qualified expert (an \u2018actuary\u2019). Trustees then have to tell members about the results of the valuation in an annual update. That\u2019s why you got your letter.\n\nThese three yearly valuations estimate how much money needs to be invested today to pay all future pensions due from the scheme.\n\nActuaries call this estimate the \u2018liabilities\u2019 (or \u2018Technical Provisions\u2019, which is the term used in pensions legislation). This estimate involves making assumptions about lots of things that could happen in future.\n\nIf the assets are less than the liabilities then there is a \u2018deficit\u2019. If a scheme has a deficit, the employer must pay extra contributions into the scheme, to get it back on track.\n\nA valuation is really a budgeting exercise to check if a scheme is broadly on track to pay out what it is due in pensions.\n\nOn track would be 100 per cent. Actuaries call this a \u2018funding level\u2019, but it\u2019s simply the value of a scheme\u2019s assets divided by its liabilities.\n\nNinety five per cent is quite close to being on track. The average funding level for all pension schemes' valuations last year was 89 per cent. It\u2019s reassuring that your old employer\u2019s scheme is doing a bit better than most other schemes.\n\nYour scheme\u2019s deficit needs to be paid off with extra contributions from your old employer. These contributions are usually paid over a few years, to help make them affordable.\n\nLooking at all of last year\u2019s valuations, the average number of years being taken to pay off deficits was six and a half years.\n\nThe size of a deficit needs to be looked at relative to the size of your old employer. Big pension schemes usually relate to big companies.\n\nSo, although the deficit may be several hundred million pounds, it should be in proportion to your old employer and should be affordable.\n\nAll of this is regulated by The Pensions Regulator. The Pensions Regulator checks that the assumptions trustees are using for valuations are ok and that employers are paying off deficits as quickly as they can.\n\nThe Pensions Regulator has been getting tougher in recent years. For example, they are pushing employers to put paying off deficits ahead of paying dividends.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to guarantee your pension will be paid in full. Odd cases about final salary pension schemes make the headlines, but these are rare.\n\nWhen they do happen, the PPF usually steps in to make sure people get most of the pension they were expecting.\n\nI hope that helps ease your mind on how safe your pension is.", "description": "How can a layperson tell when to be worried about a final salary pension deficit?
