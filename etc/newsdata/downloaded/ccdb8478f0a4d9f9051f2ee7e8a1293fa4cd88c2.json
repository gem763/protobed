What would I tell the friend about how people can change? It encourages me to apply what I just learned about personality and the brain. The total program takes me less than an hour to complete.\n\nSchleider admits that the production values are a little rudimentary; she\u2019s currently working on a slicker version. Still, last year, she and her colleague John Weisz found that a single session with a very similar program helped reduce depression and anxiety among 96 young people ages 12 to 15. Beyond digital programs such as Project Personality, Schleider\u2019s lab is about to test how well a single session of in-person psychotherapy can help teens and adults. The session will focus on \u201ctaking one step toward solving a problem that\u2019s very troublesome,\u201d she told me. \u201cPeople will leave with a concrete plan for how to cope.\u201d\n\nIf Schleider\u2019s work is successful, it may help upend the traditional, pricey model of American psychotherapy. She wants to see whether people can get the same benefit from just an hour of digital or in-person therapy as they can from paying $200 an hour every week for months.\n\nGranted, there are known risks to using well-meaning quick fixes as therapy. In one of her studies, Schleider points out that Scared Straight programs, in which teens visit with prisoners, are a type of single-session intervention, but they actually have been found to increase youth delinquency. There are also plenty of apps these days that allow people to access therapy-like programs without either an expensive psychologist or a primitive PowerPoint.\n\nBut Schleider argues that many wellness apps out there haven\u2019t been proved to work. Her lab\u2019s goal is to study the effectiveness of various programs, digital and in-person, to be sure that they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re supposed to. Effective solutions are crucial because Americans\u2014stressed out, lonely, and ghosted by Tinder dates\u2014are in desperate need of someone to talk to. The data suggest that most of the Americans who have a mental illness aren\u2019t receiving treatment. About 30 percent of psychotherapists don\u2019t take insurance. The wait list for the roster of therapists at Stony Brook\u2019s community clinic, who take insurance and charge relatively lower fees, is three to six months. As Schleider put it to me, her quick interventions offer \u201csomething, when the alternative is nothing.\u201d\n\nSingle-session interventions, like the kind Schleider studies, are typically five to 90 minutes long and, eventually, could be deployed in schools or pediatricians\u2019 offices, rather than in traditional therapists\u2019 offices. Schleider\u2019s lab is especially interested in targeting adolescents, since about half of all mental illnesses set in by age 14. Unlike traditional therapy, Schleider\u2019s program and others aim to get participants to become \u201chelpers\u201d for their peers after they\u2019ve learned information about personality change for themselves. The point is to increase intrinsic motivation: Kids might be more likely to want to sort out other kids\u2019 problems than to sit in their room and do therapy homework.", "description": "Just a few hours of therapy-like interventions can reduce some people\u2019s anxiety.", "authors": ["Olga Khazan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/AP_5604250109/facebook.jpg?1566398864", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
