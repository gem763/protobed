She spotted a parking lot and prepared to pull into it when, suddenly, she said she couldn\u2019t hear and started seeing in \u201ctunnel vision.\u201d As she drifted out of consciousness, she felt three big bumps. Moments later, a man pulled her from her wrecked car.\n\n\u201cI am so thankful for that stranger,\u201d Lugo, 32, told TODAY.\n\nAt the hospital, doctors who examined her worried that some underlying illness could have led to the incident.\n\n\u201cDoctors were like \u2018Why is a healthy 31-year-old athletic girl passing out while driving,\u2019\u201d Lugo recalled.\n\nAfter an MRI, they found a lump deep in the right side of her neck. A month later, a biopsy revealed that Lugo had stage 2 papillary thyroid cancer and she was told she needed to have her thyroid and 33 lymph nodes removed, plus radiation treatment.\n\nShe had just signed a lease for a new gym space in Dayton, Ohio, to grow her athletic training business. She was also a single mom. The news left her stunned.\n\n\u201cYou think that everything is over,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one could prepare you to hear you have stage 2 anything.\u201d\n\nIn January 2019, Lugo had the thyroid and lymph node removal surgery. Her doctors warned her that most people gain weight afterwards, but Lugo felt determined not to let that happen again.\n\nSix years ago, she weighed 322 pounds and had felt too exhausted to get off the couch to play with her son. That\u2019s when she began tracking her calories on an app and exercising four days a week and started losing weight.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started, I had no idea what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThe basics are what worked.\u201d\n\nAs she shed weight, losing 160 pounds from her 5 foot 11 inch frame, she learned that she loved exercise and decided to turn it into her career and started Erica Fit Love to help others.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

But, it hasn\u2019t always come naturally, the way it used to, since her cancer diagnosis.\n\n\u201cYou no longer have a major organ in your body that controls so much of your hormones and your mood and your metabolism,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a process of finding out what medication works for me, how my body reacts.\u201d\n\nDespite not having a thyroid, she has kept the weight off. But, she\u2019s had to make some modifications.\n\n\u201cThe high intensity interval training actually will just tank my immune system,\u201d Lugo explained. \u201cSo I can\u2019t do the HIIT I once loved to do all the time. I can only do it maybe two, max, three times a week.\u201d\n\nInstead, she walks on a treadmill at a high incline for about an hour. While it is frustrating at times, she thinks listening to her body helps her \u2014 and can help others.\n\n\u201cFitness is a lifestyle,\u201d Lugo said. \u201cIf you want to stay fit and lose weight for the long haul versus the short haul you really have to look at what workouts you\u2019re doing and is it sustainable.\u201d\n\nLugo said she uses the lessons she learned from her weight loss and experience with cancer in her role as one of the newest trainer on USA's Biggest Loser.\n\nWhen she first applied to the show, she worried she wasn't good enough to be selected.\n\n\u201cEvery day you have to work on that inner critic,\" she said. \"Reminding yourself that you are worthy, you are amazing, you are strong, you are capable of hard things.\"\n\nNow that she\u2019s there, Lugo is ecstatic about being able to help so many people.\n\n\"Every day I have to pinch myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is an insane experience being on the show knowing that five years ago I was 322 pounds and here I am \u2026 teaching people how to lose weight and become better versions of themselves.\"\n\nThese are her tips to help anyone maintain their weight loss.\n\n1. Learn about maintenance during weight loss\n\nWhile losing weight, she went out to eat or attended birthday parties and enjoyed all foods in moderation. Learning how to eat in social settings while losing weight made it easier for her not to splurge as she maintains.\n\n\u201cIf you restrict yourself all the time when you are losing weight, when you get to maintenance you have no idea how to do it,\u201d she said.\n\n2. Plan for the unexpected\n\nIf Lugo is stuck somewhere, she doesn't want to feel trapped into eating fast food. So she is always prepared.\n\n\u201cI have what I call an emergency kit in my car,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I am out all day long and shopping and may not be able to get home in get my meal I will always shave a quick energy snack in my glove box, which is something that won\u2019t melt.\u201d\n\nShe also knows which restaurants have the healthiest meals so she can always find something to eat.\n\n3. Create a structure\n\nHaving a routine that is consistent makes it easier for her to maintain her positive exercise and eating behaviors.\n\n\u201cI lack willpower, which is crazy to say\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the hardest things that I have to do.\u201d", "description": "\"Biggest Loser\" trainer Erica Lugo weighed 322 pounds, lost 160 pounds, then faced thyroid cancer.
