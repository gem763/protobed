Do you mean that game you play with your hands ... volleyball? Tell me the offside rule if you are a footballer.\u201d That was how one taxi driver reacted when Didem Karagen\u00e7 explained to him that she is a footballer. \u201cThis is what I have to put up with,\u201d she says with a laugh, thinking back to that moment.\n\nKaragen\u00e7 is the captain of Turkey\u2019s national team as well as of Be\u015fikta\u015f, playing a key role in the Black Eagles lifting last season\u2019s Super Lig title. She also wants to be a role model and inspiration for the next generation of female footballers.\n\nArsenal cruise past Fiorentina into last 16 thanks to Little and Miedema Read more\n\n\u201cYoung girls had nobody to look up to in the past,\u201d says Karagen\u00e7. \u201cI watched men\u2019s football and was a huge fan of Roberto Carlos. But there were no female players to emulate \u2013 I had to become my own role model.\u201d\n\nBe\u015fikta\u015f are one of the biggest clubs in Turkey, with millions of fans, a huge number of trophies and some of the highest-paid footballers in the country. But their women\u2019s team was only founded in 2014, 103 years after the men\u2019s.\n\nKaragen\u00e7, a 25-year-old left-back, joined Be\u015fikta\u015f a year after they were formed and played a part in them cruising through the 2015-16 campaign as undefeated champions of the Second Football League and thus ensuring promotion to the top-tier. After finishing the 2017-18 season as runners-up, they went onto lift the title last season and book a place in the Champions League.\n\nIt was a heady time yet for Karagen\u00e7 and her team-mates, as one of struggle given their lack of financial reward and support. \u201cTo be honest, I thought about quitting football,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was heartbreaking but I couldn\u2019t see a way I could continue supporting myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made me feel worthless. I have loved this game since I was a little girl. I am also a teacher and an analyst for the TFF [Turkish Football Federation] \u2013 I have to do two jobs to survive, and after work I train in the evening. Thankfully the manager, Mutlucan Zavot\u00e7u, understands the situation I and a lot of my teammates are in. And I am one of the fortunate ones in a much better position than most women in the game.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Didem Karagen\u00e7 in action for Turkey against the Netherlands this month.

Take boot deals. The sponsors give the guys boots but we have to get our own. A lot of the girls in the league struggle to even afford boots. It is great that women like [United States winger and equal pay-campaigner] Megan Rapinoe are speaking out. Rapinoe, Ellen White and the other big names have had such a big influence on changing people\u2019s perceptions of the sport. For the first time, the mainstream media is taking notice of the female stars.\u201d\n\nThe future felt bleak for Karagen\u00e7 just a few months ago. \u201cBut I refused to give up even though it felt like women were invisible in football,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to show that women are strong, that we can play football as well and that hopefully if I don\u2019t quit I could inspire young girls growing up today not to give up on their dreams. If someone loves football, why does it matter what gender they are? It shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt was around the same time that Karagen\u00e7 had a change in fortune. \u201cI got a call from someone in London who said they wanted me to be a part of Team Visa.\u201d Visa became the biggest global sponsor of women\u2019s football after signing a seven-year partnership with Uefa last year. In a sport where pay is low \u2013 some female footballers do not even earn a wage from the game \u2013 sponsors are of vital importance.\n\n\u201cTeam Visa told me they want me, I felt valued, that finally, someone out there noticed me,\u201d says Karagen\u00e7. \u201cThey picked me as one of several female players around the world as part of their new campaign. It was a game-changer. I have got to travel to different countries, meet other female footballers and learn what is happening around the world.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Didem Karagen\u00e7 says: \u2018I refused to give up even though it felt like women were invisible in football.\u2019 Photograph: Eren Sarigul and Emre Sarigul/Turkish Football\n\n\u201cI was invited to France for the [Women\u2019s] World Cup as part of the Team Visa program. To see the women\u2019s game reach this level was an emotional moment. I\u2019ve never seen so many people talk about football first and gender second when it comes to women\u2019s football,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wished Turkey had qualified. When I saw the national team anthem being read I imagined what it would feel like to be in that situation. It was overwhelming, I don\u2019t know if I would be able to hold the tears back.\u201d\n\nAs is the case in many other country\u2019s, football is seen as a man\u2019s game in Turkey. However, anybody attending a men\u2019s game in the country would more often than not spot many female faces in the crowd. Back in 2011, for instance, 41,000 women watched Fenerbah\u00e7e take on Manisaspor after men had been suspended from the fixture as punishment for crowd trouble.\n\nDespite this show of support, Fenerbahce do not have a women\u2019s team, as is also the case at Galatasaray. \u201cHopefully we will see that in Turkey,\u201d says Karagen\u00e7. \u201cI think it would be great for competition.\u201d\n\nBe\u015fikta\u015f deserve credit for taking the lead in the women\u2019s game and the fans have started getting behind their team. \u201cBe\u015fikta\u015f fans are so supportive, we get a few hundred that turn up at most games and they don\u2019t act differently because we are girls,\u201d says Karagen\u00e7. \u201cThe more fans that come the more coverage we will get. The fans are everything.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nFootball being more than a sport may sound like a cliche but in Turkey it\u2019s very much true \u2013 female players who represent the national team are also given the chance to gain a university education while those who play for clubs that have a Turkish Football Federation license can go onto gain the credits required for a scholarship from local businesses.\n\n\u201cI was lucky; my father is a teacher and always supported me,\u201d says Karagen\u00e7. \u201cIn fact, he helped me find my first team and encouraged me to play. And my mum has always been my biggest fan.\u201d Every sport needs a hero. Turkish women\u2019s football may just have found theirs.", "description": "Turkey\u2019s captain considered quitting football due to a lack of financial support but aims to show no girl should give up on a dream", "authors": ["Emre Sarigul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d65749b88d5b8dbe1483b84d141732446511e40e/0_49_1620_972/master/1620.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a1188948171f4da4b9f1ab3f6da6a9a", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
