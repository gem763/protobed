He was not looking towards Ndour when he bumped into her.\n\nFahy immediately ejected Ndour from the game despite the minimal and unintentional contact.\n\nAccording to WNBA rules, any contact between a player and referee should result in an ejection. However, due to the nature of the contact, many felt the ejection was uncalled for.\n\nSky head coach James Wade disputed the call, which was reviewed by three officials before Ndour was escorted off the court by security.\n\n\"I have always shown great respect for the referees and my career supports me,\" Ndour wrote on Twitter. \"I still don't understand very well what happened today and I don't agree, but I respect the decision. I will continue to work hard.
