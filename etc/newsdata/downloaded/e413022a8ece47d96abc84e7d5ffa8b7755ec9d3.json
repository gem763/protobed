Photo-Illustration: James Gallagher\n\nThis week, a woman who lives at home and tells her parents all about her very active sex life: straight, single, Long Island, 30.\n\nDAY ONE\n\n7:00 a.m. I wake up super-early every day even though I don\u2019t have to. I come from a family of early birds. Can\u2019t seem to escape my DNA \u2026.\n\n11:30 a.m. I\u2019m a pet groomer at a local pet shop. My shift starts at noon but I get in a little early to play with the animals. I love animals. They keep me sane. I smoke a cigarette outside the shop and try to get into work mode. My mood is so-so. I\u2019m not particularly sad or angry today, so that\u2019s good.\n\n2:30 p.m. Another cigarette break. I check my Facebook messages. I don\u2019t online date but I flirt with a lot of guys on Facebook. I guess you could say I\u2019m a sex addict. That\u2019s probably the clinical term but I\u2019m also okay with saying that I just love sex. It\u2019s been about 10 years of constant sex with inappropriate men. Usually they are much, much older. A few have been married. Today a guy from the town over is texting about hanging out tonight. We usually get high, fuck, and then I go home. It\u2019s both a completely empty and completely intoxicating experience. I tell him I\u2019ll go home, shower, and be there by 8pm.\n\n6:00 p.m. Dinner with my parents is always nice. They\u2019re super-supportive. My aunts and uncles say they\u2019re enablers but I think they\u2019re just loving. I haven\u2019t had an easy life. I\u2019ve always been overweight and was never popular. We\u2019re very open. They know about my active sex life and they let me talk about things. All they care about is that it\u2019s consensual and that I use protection.\n\n9:00 p.m. I\u2019m fucking this old guy at his house. By old, I mean maybe 50. I\u2019m 30. He actually has a nice big fat cock. I make him eat me out until I come. I never have sex without coming. Then we smoke a bowl. I wait til I\u2019m sober enough to drive home.\n\n11:00 p.m. In bed. What people don\u2019t understand is that a night like this is enough for me. Sometimes I get really lonely but sometimes a day of work, family time, and sex is all I need. Honestly I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m extra-simple or extra-complicated\u2026.\n\nDAY TWO\n\n8:00 a.m. Two days a week I volunteer at a local nursing home. I love old people. They\u2019re so warm and funny.\n\n11:30 a.m. I head to work. My boss is a real dick and he\u2019s been out on vacation, but he\u2019s back today. Great. He looks down on me because I\u2019m fat. Whatever. He\u2019s meaningless to me. I love the animals and I like the work, so I focus on that.\n\n3:30 p.m. I run to CVS to fill some prescriptions. I had back surgery last year, and I\u2019ve always lived with chronic pain. No one understands what that\u2019s like unless you\u2019ve been there.\n\n6:30 p.m. I\u2019m meeting a friend for dinner at the mall. I\u2019ve never had a lot of friends but I\u2019m extremely loyal to the friends I do have. This friend, Sarah, is a little hard to hang out with because her life is perfect compared to mine. Tonight I feel like she\u2019s sorta rubbing it in. She\u2019s engaged and they\u2019re buying a house; I\u2019m single and live with my parents. Sarah\u2019s a good person and I think she tries to be encouraging, but it just makes me feel like a loser. I don\u2019t tell her this.\n\n8:30 p.m. On the way home, I text Ryan to see if he\u2019s around. He\u2019s a recovering alcoholic I met through the nursing home (his grandma is there). He\u2019s sober now but still having a hard time. He doesn\u2019t have much money, and his house is filthy. But I like his company. He lets me be me. The sex is not good with Ryan, but I like trying, and I like being in his arms. He texts back that he\u2019s going to sleep early tonight. Oh well.\n\nDAY THREE\n\n11:30 a.m. Pre-work cigarette. I\u2019m starting a diet today. No carbs. It worked for me before: I once lost 60 pounds in four months. I felt great. But I fell off track and the weight came back fast. It\u2019s so hard to be on a diet\u2026.it\u2019s like, impossible for me. I have cousins who try to motivate me, and say they\u2019ll train me, or stay on me, or whatever it takes. But something is holding me back. I don\u2019t really know what it is. Maybe I\u2019m lazy. Maybe deep down I like who I am? I haven\u2019t been to therapy in a few years but it\u2019s probably time to go back.\n\n6:30 p.m. I go home to shower because I\u2019m meeting a guy, Bob, tonight. Bob is an old hippy who came into the pet shop recently. He\u2019s a widow, I think. I have a lot of empathy for him and he\u2019s kind of sexy in an old cowboy kind of way.\n\n9:00 p.m. Bob has a really cute house. It\u2019s clean, and he made us dinner, which is sweet. He drinks water and I drink wine. He\u2019s 30 years sober or something. It\u2019s like everyone I meet is either sober or an addict of some sort. After dinner he moves closer to me. It\u2019s not as creepy as it sounds. Turns out he doesn\u2019t want to fuck; he just wants to get me off. I\u2019m sure that has something to do with his age. I let him finger me on the couch and then he goes down on me until I come. It\u2019s all sort of sweet and embarrassing for both of us.\n\n10:30 p.m. I\u2019m home and telling my mom about Bob. She says it sounds horrible, but she also doesn\u2019t judge. I love my mom.\n\nDAY FOUR\n\n1:30 p.m. My boss at work \u2014 the dickhead \u2014 actually tells me I\u2019m getting a little raise! It\u2019s about time. I have to say, I\u2019m really good at what I do. The customers love me and the animals respond beautifully. I\u2019m feeling good about myself at the moment!\n\n4:30 p.m. One of my cousins swings by the pet shop to convince me to take a little run with her after work. It is a beautiful night. I tell her to pick me up around 7p.m.\n\n7:00 p.m. Okay, I hate running. It\u2019s pretty much impossible with my back and my weight, so we do a power-walk. I love my cousin. She\u2019s married and has her life together, but she also lets me tell her all my crazy sex stories. She doesn\u2019t seem to think my life is disgusting or embarrassing, like some of my other cousins do.\n\n9:00 p.m. I\u2019m watching Real Housewives of Orange County with my mom and dad. It\u2019s the best.\n\nDAY FIVE\n\n9:30 a.m. I masturbate in the shower with the shower head. I do this every morning. It\u2019s my favorite way to come! TGIF!!!\n\n2:30 p.m. Smoke break. I text with Randy. Randy lives near my parents\u2019 house. He\u2019s harmless but has a lot of dirtbag friends and they\u2019re having a big party tonight. That means I\u2019m getting fucked up \u2014 and fucked. I convince my friend Cammie to come, too. I\u2019ve known Cammie since high school. She\u2019s a really nice girl from a nice family \u2014 my parents love her. She loves sex too, by the way.\n\n9:00 p.m. Cammie picks me up and we head to Randy\u2019s. So far just a few guys are there. They\u2019re drinking beer and watching a comedy show. Everyone is nice. I look around and try to figure out who I\u2019m attracted to. There is one guy, Tyrell, who\u2019s really big but has a really nice face. No wedding ring, either. He\u2019s kind of quiet. He says he works for a football team but that\u2019s all he\u2019ll tell me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s professional or high school or what. We start drinking together, taking shots, smoking cigarettes, and I know what\u2019s next\u2026.\n\n10:00 p.m. Tyrell and I are fucking in Randy\u2019s bedroom. It\u2019s really good. I\u2019m on top of the world (and on top of Tyrell). When we leave the bedroom and I see that Cammie is making out with the cutest guy in the room, of course. The party is getting lit but I had my sex and kind of want to go home. I tell Tyrell I\u2019m tired and he offers to drive me home, which I think is sweet.\n\n10:45 p.m. Tyrell drops me off and asks for my number. I wonder if he\u2019ll actually call me. I think he\u2019s great. I go inside and tell my mom and dad about him and they say he sounds like someone I could actually date. Mind you, I haven\u2019t had a real boyfriend in maybe 7 years. My last boyfriend was in college and he ended up being a total dirtbag who I think is in jail now.\n\nDAY SIX\n\n7:00 a.m. I hate that even when I\u2019m hungover and even when I don\u2019t have to work, I wake up this early. I go to the couch and turn on the TV. My parents went camping for the weekend so I\u2019m home alone. I don\u2019t really like to be alone.\n\n12:30 p.m. I\u2019ve convinced one of my cousins to come by. I tell him about all my hook-ups for the week and he says I just like the attention. Maybe he\u2019s right. Who doesn\u2019t like attention though? Does that make me fucked up? I don\u2019t think so!\n\n9:30 p.m. I swear I\u2019ve watched every single movie on Netflix today and none of them were great. Going to call it a night. But first I masturbate super loudly because I\u2019m home alone and why not.\n\nDAY SEVEN\n\n7:00 a.m. Today is going to be a repeat of yesterday, I think. Weekends are a little hard for me because I don\u2019t have anywhere to be and it feels like my life is purposeless and meaningless. I miss my parents and I miss the animals from work.\n\n12:30 p.m. I get a text from Tyrell. He wants to know what I\u2019m up to. I tell him I\u2019m cleaning the house (kind of true) and relaxing. He asks if I want to grab a slice of pizza later and hang out. Of course I do! I make myself wait ten full minutes before writing back.\n\n5:30 p.m. We meet a local pizza place. He looks really handsome. We get food and beer and start talking. It\u2019s nice to learn about him. Our lives have had some similar obstacles: weight, depression, chronic pain\u2026 I think he\u2019s a nice guy. That\u2019s a rare find!\n\n7:00 p.m. I invite him back to my place since I know my parents are gone until tomorrow. And I did clean it up, after all. He comes in and very quickly we start having sex on the couch. The sex is faster than I would have liked but like I said, he has a great dick so I come when he comes. Pizza plus sex \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019d call a great Sunday afternoon.\n\n8:00 p.m. Tyrell says he has to head home so we don\u2019t cuddle much. Maybe next time. He says he\u2019d love to hang out again soon. Fingers crossed!\n\nGet Sex Diaries delivered every week.
