Now he may face one on his watch.", "language": "en", "text": "By suddenly pulling U.S. troops from northeast Syria, analysts say Trump has left the Kurdish population there \u2014 including many who fought as U.S. allies against the Islamic State terrorist group \u2014 vulnerable to invading Turkish forces. Trump didn\u2019t help his case when, in a nod to Turkey\u2019s view that many Kurds are terrorists, he said the Turks needed the area \u201ccleaned out.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s troop pullout, coming so soon after the launch of the atrocity prevention initiative, is the latest illustration of how the Republican president is often out of sync with his own administration\u2019s stated priorities. The pullout is likely to further confuse U.S. allies about America\u2019s reliability, while potentially emboldening would-be war criminals.\n\n\u201cThe first rule of atrocity prevention is do no harm,\u201d said the International Crisis Group\u2019s Stephen Pomper, who handled similar efforts under the Obama administration. Trump\u2019s actions in northeast Syria, he said, \u201cseemed to maximize chaos and put civilians in unnecessary risk.\u201d\n\nAs a 120-hour cease-fire expired Tuesday, U.S. lawmakers, rights activists and others feared that the worst is yet to come for the Kurds and other ethnic and religious minorities who had created a semi-safe haven in northeast Syria. The Turkish incursion already has displaced more than 100,000 people.\n\nTurkish aid workers cross the Turkish border as they enter the Syrian city of Tel Abyad on Oct. 19, 2019. | Burak Kara/Getty Images\n\nVideos posted by various media outlets showed Kurds pelting exiting U.S. military vehicles with rotten fruit and stones, accusing America of betraying them. And hours before the cease-fire ended, Russia and Turkey announced they\u2019d work together to remove Kurdish fighters from the area, a declaration that deeply alarmed rights activists.\n\nInside the Trump administration, officials are watching in a daze, unsure of what they can say even to each other. How to protect the Kurds and other groups in the affected territory has been a topic of discussion at a variety of levels in the administration.\n\n\u201cThe Syria thing is a great example of where the president does something, and everyone has to sit around a room and figure out how to make it happen, and no one wants to say it\u2019s stupid,\u201d an administration official said.\n\nAdministration staffers intend to monitor northeast Syria to catalog any atrocities in the coming days, the official said. But there\u2019s uncertainty as to whether Trump will support them if they call for holding accountable any possible perpetrators, such as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nIn theory, that could include demanding that accused perpetrators face international justice for offenses such as \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d But the U.S. president is so mercurial that Erdogan or others could convince him \u201cwell, this happens in war,\u201d the administration official said.\n\nA spokesman for the National Security Council declined to offer comment for this story.\n\nAs is often the case on human rights writ large, Trump has sent mixed signals about what he will tolerate in Syria.\n\nHe already has imposed sanctions on top aides to Erdogan and warned of additional economic penalties on other Turkish officials who \u201cmay be involved in serious human rights abuses.\u201d His administration also has announced millions of dollars in aid packages for people caught in the conflict in Syria.\n\nYet he\u2019s also expressed sympathy for the Turkish fears that the Kurdish fighters in Syria have a grander plan that aligns with those of Kurdish separatists in Turkey: to carve out their own homeland. Turkey views the separatists as terrorists and has fought them for years on its territory.\n\nTrump also has repeatedly dissed the Kurds, a population that has lost thousands of lives in the U.S.-backed battle against the Islamic State terrorists in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cWe never agreed to, you know, protect the Kurds,\u201d Trump said Monday. \u201cWe fought with them for three and a half to four years. We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\nMany observers believe that, through military operations, resettlement of Syrian refugees and other tactics, Erdogan wants to change the demographics of the Syrian land that borders Turkey to diminish Kurdish power. Such a goal seriously raises the risk of mass violence, analysts say.\n\n\u201cErdogan\u2019s intentions are clear: an ethnic cleansing mission in northeastern Syria at the expense of broader regional stability, including the fight against [the Islamic State], and of partnership and cooperation with the United States and other NATO allies,\u201d said New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, during a hearing Tuesday.\n\nPreventing mass atrocities has long been a U.S. priority dating to the Holocaust, although America\u2019s record on the issue \u2014 think Rwanda and Darfur, among other cases \u2014 is spotty at best.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. | Presidential Press Service via AP, Pool\n\nPresident Barack Obama declared the prevention of mass atrocities a \u201ccore national security interest.\u201d He established the Atrocities Prevention Board \u2014 a group of U.S. officials from various agencies tasked with watching for warning signs of potential mass killings to help divert them.\n\nThe board had mixed success : It\u2019s thought to have driven more attention and resources to under-scrutinized parts of the world, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi, where its efforts may have helped contain violence linked to election-related disputes.\n\nBut the half-million killed in Syria\u2019s civil war, as well as crackdowns in countries such as Myanmar, raised questions about the board\u2019s effectiveness. Obama\u2019s refusal to insert U.S. troops to fight against the brutal Syrian regime of Bashar Assad added to the complications.\n\nBy the time Trump took over, bipartisan legislative efforts were in the works to make preventing atrocities a legally codified priority for the U.S. government. Even on its own, though, the Trump administration nodded to the importance of the issue.\n\n\u201cWe will hold perpetrators of genocide and mass atrocities accountable,\u201d stated Trump\u2019s official National Security Strategy, dated December 2017 and signed by the president.\n\nRemnants of the Atrocities Prevention Board also sporadically met during Trump\u2019s first couple of years, though at relatively low levels, according to a former National Security Council official. It was highly unlikely Trump even knew the board existed, the official said. \u201cIt never would have bubbled up that high.\u201d\n\nStill, plenty of people inside the administration \u2014 including Trump political appointees, not just career staffers \u2014 supported the general idea animating the atrocities prevention effort.\n\nThey included Vice President Mike Pence and others who saw much of atrocity prevention through the lens of religious freedom, a key issue for the many evangelical Christians in Trump\u2019s electoral base. The Trump administration even made a point of reiterating an Obama-era declaration that Christians, Yazidis and other religious groups were the victims of genocide at the hands of Islamic State terrorists in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAt the same time, the administration was unable to prevent \u2014 and at some levels seemed surprised by \u2014 what it later labeled an \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar in 2017. That crackdown \u2014 the worst by far in several years of crackdowns, including under Obama \u2014 killed thousands and led more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional efforts to make atrocity prevention a priority moved ahead, according to people who monitored the issue. For human rights activists, it was important to get atrocity prevention codified so that its importance didn\u2019t rely on who happened to be president.\n\nIn January of this year, Trump signed the result of one such effort: the bipartisan \u201c Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act.\u201d\n\nThe act endorsed the idea of an entity like the Atrocities Prevention Board. Its many other elements included requiring that U.S. diplomats be trained on spotting warning signs of coming atrocities and that governing administration issue regular reports on its atrocity prevention efforts.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration has built on what the Obama team left in place, it\u2019s also made some changes. For one thing, it went with different branding. Instead of keeping the Atrocities Prevention Board, the Trump team decided to call their version the \u201cAtrocity Early Warning Task Force.\u201d\n\nMuch of the work in the atrocity prevention space is classified \u2014 including the use of intelligence reports about conditions in global hotspots \u2014 so U.S. officials are limited in what they can say.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

His admirers, however, say he\u2019s shown that he is willing to, at the very least, punish perpetrators.\n\nThey point out that he launched airstrikes against the Syrian regime after determining it had used chemical weapons. They also note that it was under Trump that the U.S. sanctioned military officials in Myanmar over the Rohingya crisis. Trump also has levied sanctions on a slew of alleged human rights violators worldwide using what\u2019s known as the Global Magnitsky Act.\n\nBut detractors say Trump\u2019s targeting of human rights violators has been exceptionally selective, often driven by political convenience. More than most modern presidents, Trump has made it clear he won\u2019t slap countries for human rights abuses if he views it as counter to U.S. interests.\n\nOne example: Trump has declined to sanction Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite the Saudi government\u2019s killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who had been living in the United States.\n\nWhile Trump has imposed sanctions on other Saudi officials over the killing, he excused not targeting bin Salman in part because the Saudi government is a major purchaser of U.S. arms.\n\nTurkey offers a similar dilemma. It is a fellow member of NATO. It is located in an area of geo-strategic importance. The United States is also believed to base some of its global nuclear architecture in Turkey.\n\nHuman rights activists, however, say there\u2019s already evidence that Turkey is ignoring international law in Syria, and that Trump can\u2019t afford to look away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve documented war crimes that have been committed already,\u201d said Philippe Nassif, a top official with Amnesty International USA. \u201cThis could be the beginning of a larger trend of ethnic cleansing in northeastern Syria.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9a/9e/ec8f4d4541689c2e3e5241ae12f9/191022-syria-us-army-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
