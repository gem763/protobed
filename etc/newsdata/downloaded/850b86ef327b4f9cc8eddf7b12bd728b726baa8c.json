Once a renowned political consultant who made a fortune lobbying for foreign dictators, Manafort's fall from grace was exacerbated by his chronic aversion to telling the truth. He lied to his accountants, his banks, his own lawyers and most importantly to the special counsel.\n\nUnlike the Virginia trial, Manafort's D.C. case \u2014 which resulted in more than 500 court filings and a final sentencing memo that totaled more than 800 pages \u2014 revealed several key insights about Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.\n\nSpecifically, prosecutors called attention to Manafort's lies about his contacts with suspected Russian intelligence operative Konstantin Kilimnik \u2014 a topic Mueller's team said at a hearing goes \"very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating.\"\n\nA poorly redacted court filing by Manafort's lawyers revealed that he lied about sharing 2016 internal campaign polling data with Kilimnik and about their discussions about a secret Ukrainian peace plan. Manafort's longtime deputy Rick Gates, who is cooperating with Mueller and has a status hearing on Friday, reportedly provided information about these episodes to investigators.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump and his defenders have consistently argued that Manafort's crimes have nothing to do with the president or collusion with Russia. But as Jackson said at the sentencing: \"Any conspiracy, collusion was not presented in this case, therefore it was not resolved by this case.\"\n\nManafort is now heading to prison in part, as Jackson noted in an earlier hearing, because he repeatedly lied in an effort to \"shield his Russian conspirator from liability.\"\n\nQuestions about why the former Trump campaign chairman was willing to risk the rest of his life in prison to hide his Russian contacts remain unanswered.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "He has been given an additional 43 months in his second case.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/-DABF29XceIjV69kZD6LQgY3Fy4=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/03/13/1552481626057.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-13"}
