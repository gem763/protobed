They put the turnout in Toulouse at \u201cseveral thousand\u201d and said two people had been slightly hurt \u2014 one demonstrator and one police officer.\n\nToulouse is a stronghold of the yellow vest movement, named by some as its \u201cnational capital\u201d, and has been the scene of clashes between police and protesters in previous weekends.\n\n\u201cThe police treat us like cockroaches and ban us from protesting,\u201d said Nathalie, a 60-year-old unemployed woman, as street medics treated her for a cut to her finger.\n\nOdile Maurin, a regular at the Toulouse protests and president of disabled rights association Handi-Social described the police action as \u201cinstitutional ill-treatment\u201d.\n\nShe went on trial Friday for insulting behaviour and violence against police officer, accused of having used her wheelchair as a weapon at a previous protest.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Resistance is a duty\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe yellow vest movement regularly contests police estimates of their protests as gross underestimates.\n\nThere were brief scuffles in the northeastern city of Metz when several dozen protesters, mostly youths dressed in black, broke out of the main procession and tried to go down pedestrian streets.\n\nThey threw stones and three Molotov cocktails at officers but did not cause any injuries, said police.\n\nAround 200 people marched in the capital, Paris, without incident.\n\nAnd about a hundred people marched in the northern city of Lille, an AFP journalist noted. \u201cWhen injustice becomes the law, resistance is a duty,\u201d said one placard.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was caught out by the yellow vest protests when they started last year, as protesters accused him of ignoring the day-to-day struggles of ordinary French people.\n\nThe numbers have dropped far below the initial protest in November last year, which brought out more than 280,000 people across France.\n\nBut a dedicated group of activists maintain the Saturday protests in cities around France, arguing that Macron is still ignoring the needs of marginalised groups such as the working poor.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Scuffles broke out at the start of the weekly \"yellow vest\" protest in the French southwestern city of Toulouse Saturday, as police used tear gas to disperse thousands of demonstrators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Paris-high-alert-yellow-vest-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
