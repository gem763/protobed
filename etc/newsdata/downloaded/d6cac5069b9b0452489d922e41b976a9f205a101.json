The Fake News Media was not!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow lovely,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cHe\u2019s comforting imaginary victims of a disaster that never happened.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Colbert imagined what it might be like when Trump visits real victims of the hurricane in parts of the east coast that were actually affected. \u201cSo sad to see the damage here in South Carolina,\u201d he said as the president. \u201cOr, as many call it, East Alabama.\u201d", "description": "\u2018I was with you all the way Alabama,\u2019 Trump tweeted on Thursday. \u2018The Fake News Media was not!\u2019", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_24/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567742839/SC_iib86g", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
