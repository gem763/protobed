We know we do, and apparently so does one of Hollywood\u2019s most glamorous A-listers.\u00c2 Eva Mendes just shared a photo of herself at Supercuts, proving once again that she\u2019s about as down-to-earth as celebrities come. Plus, her hair always looks amazing, so clearly being a bargain-hunter is working in her favor.\n\nMendes revealed in an Instagram post on Monday that she had popped into Supercuts, sharing a photo of herself sitting in a salon chair draped in the budget-friendly chain\u2019s signature apron. \u201cOk this is a terrible angle but I thought you guys would like to know that yea, I stop into @supercuts every once in awhile. Y que?!\u201d Mendes captioned the in-progress snapshot. Fans quickly weighed in by praising Mendes in the comment feed, giving her credit for \u201ckeeping it real\u201d and having a genuine \u201chumbleness\u201d about her.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nAnd although Mendes didn\u2019t specify in her caption what she had stopped into Supercuts to have done, she did reveal in a reply some of the services she enjoys there. When a fan noted, \u201cThey\u2019re great for a trim and a quick layer,\u201d Mendes responded, \u201cTotally! And great for a quick wash and dry!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Mendes\u2019 husband, Ryan Gosling, is also a fan of the affordable salon franchise. But the couple does seem refreshingly \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nIn September, Mendes admitted that she and Gosling have to work hard to pull off a date night as parents of two young children. \u201cIt takes a lot of prep,\u201d she told Access Daily. \u201cYou got to prep it ad make sure you have it all lined up. Luckily we have a lot of family support. My family lives here. His family comes in, they live in Canada but they come in all the time and stay for a very long time, and it\u2019s very welcomed.\u201d Of their everyday life with daughters Esmeralda, 5, and Amada, 3, she said, \u201cOh, gosh, it\u2019s so fun and beautiful and maddening. It\u2019s maddening.\u201d\n\nYep, Mendes is always one to keep it real \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and we dig her for it.\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
