(Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nWay back on January 10, 1987, evangelical television viewers witnessed a rather infamous request for money:\n\nOral Roberts needs about $4.5 million in \u201cquick money\u201d from followers or God won\u2019t let him live past March, the evangelist says. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to help me extend my life,\u201d Roberts told his television audience Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where God could call Oral Roberts home.\u201d Speaking from the clinical laboratory at his City of Faith Medical and Research Center, Roberts asked viewers to send $100 immediately and pledge additional amounts for February and March. The evangelist, who will be 69 on Jan. 24, said God told him that raising the possibility of his death was necessary to get the attention of his followers.\n\nOral Roberts did hit his fundraising mark, and \u2014 perhaps because God was pleased with his fundraising, or perhaps coincidentally \u2014 lived to age 91, passing away in 2009.\n\nEarlier this year, Cory Booker said that if his campaign didn\u2019t raise $2 million in ten days, he might not be in the race much longer. Booker hit the threshold. Now, Julian Castro is making a variation of the same pitch: donate now, or the God of Campaign Expenses will call Julian Castro home!\n\nThe fundraising tactic is a last-ditch effort for a candidate who has struggled to raise money for much of his campaign; he entered the fourth quarter of 2019 with less than $700,000 in the bank. In the email, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary writes that the donations are needed to help him qualify for November\u2019s Democratic debate, something he has failed to do so far. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to fight for me like never before,\u201d Castro says in the email. \u201cIf I don\u2019t meet this deadline, I won\u2019t have the resources to keep my campaign running. I\u2019m counting on your $5 in this critical moment.\u201d\n\nIn related news, National Review could really use your support, but as far as we know, God isn\u2019t threatening to off anyone if you don\u2019t give enough.", "description": "He really wants your help.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
