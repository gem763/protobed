Telstra has announced, in partnership with Ericsson, that it will be installing 5G at the stadium ahead of this weekend's Australian Football League (AFL) grand final.\n\n\"On match day last year, we saw a massive 3.8 terabytes of data sent over Telstra's mobile network at the MCG, which is equivalent to 1,200 hours of HD video content. We'll see this lift again next weekend with more data and more capability at the G,\" said Telstra Networks and IT group executive Nikos Katinakis.\n\nHe added the upgrade will also enhance the network to further support its 4G customers.\n\nAccording to Telstra, the upgrade is part of a wider initiative that has been going on since 2015 where the telco has been upgrading both its 3G and 4G networks at the MCG.\n\nHowever, this initial rollout is only the first stage of installation, the company said, noting Telstra and Ericsson will continue to evaluate 4G and 5G coverage at the MCG following the weekend event.\n\nSee also: 5G outlook: What's to come in 2019 and beyond (TechRepublic)\n\nTelstra has rolled out 5G in 10 cities across Australia, with plans to increase its 5G coverage almost five-fold and reach at least 35 Australian cities over the next 12 months.\n\nThe goal comes as Telstra CEO Andy Penn recently labelled 5G as a \"strong growth engine\" for the company's average per user (ARPU).\n\n\"ARPUs tend to increase, particularly in the early stages of a rollout,\" Penn said during the company's annual retail shareholder day earlier this month. \"So we see that happening in 5G as well as we look forward over the next couple of years.\"\n\nIn July, Telstra and Ericsson made the first end-to-end 5G standalone call in the southern hemisphere at Telstra's 5G Innovation Centre on the Gold Coast. The test was conducted with 3.6GHz spectrum, Ericsson Baseband equipment, and a 5G standalone device with a MediaTek chip.\n\nEricsson ANZ head Emilio Romeo said at the time the test was a \"vital step\".\n\n\"Together with Telstra -- one of the world's first operators to launch 5G commercially on 5G non-standalone -- we continue to lead and drive innovation to ensure Australia remains at the forefront of telecommunications technology,\" Romeo said.\n\nRelated coverage\n\nTelstra releases HTC 5G Hub online\n\nPricing to start from AU$70 a month for 10GB of base data.\n\nTelstra's 5G add-on for new mobile plans costs AU$15 a month\n\nCustomers signing up to yet-to-be-released mobile plans will receive free 5G connectivity for at least 12 months.\n\nTelstra finds 5G energy levels sitting well under safety limits\n\nAustralian telco says electromagnetic energy used in 5G are similar to 3G, 4G, and Wi-Fi.\n\nTelstra flicks on a tiny piece of 5G in Melbourne and Sydney\n\nSydney and Melbourne have very small patches of 5G available, with Telstra getting early access to 3.6GHz spectrum.\n\nTelstra has its first enterprise 5G customer\n\nTelstra has announced providing commercial 5G connectivity to FKG Group via the HTC 5G Hub, with the company testing the service across IoT applications in Toowoomba.", "description": "It comes just in time for this weekend's AFL grand final taking place at the MCG.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/26/9e1eb6fd-1015-4c75-bbf6-6b28bd8f7730/thumbnail/770x578/38bd7e742f637e7a2d287259ca39edcc/istock-5g.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
