The researchers created a map of used 93,658 different polling places across the US. They then used smartphone pings that came within nearly 200 feet of a selected polling place. At the end of the collection, there was a sample of more than 150,000 voters at 40,000 polling locations. In order to determine the race of these neighborhoods, the team looked to demographic data from the US Census.\n\n'This disparity holds when comparing predominantly white and black polling places within the same states and counties, and survives numerous robustness and placebo tests.'\n\n'Our results document large racial differences in voting wait times and demonstrates that geospatial data can be an effective tool to both measure and monitor these disparities.'\n\nTo get their results, researchers used 93,658 different polling places across the US and converted each location into latitude and longitude coordinates in order to create a map of voting spots using Google Maps API and use Microsoft-OpenStreetmaps, according to Scientific American.\n\nThen smartphone pings were collected from cellphone towers in the area, as this technology determines the owner's location 'with reasonable accuracy'.\n\nThe team gathered pings that came within nearly 200 feet of a selected polling place during the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nThen smartphone pings were collected from cellphone towers in the area, as this technology determines the owner's location 'with reasonable accuracy'. The team gathered pings that came within nearly 200 feet of a selected polling place during the 2016 US election\n\nHowever, data was combed through to determine who was and was not a voter.\n\nAt the end of the collection, there was a sample of more than 150,000 voters at 40,000 polling locations.\n\nIn order to determine the race of these neighborhoods, the team looked to demographic data from the US Census.\n\nRelative to entirely-white neighborhoods, residents of entirely-black neighborhoods waited 29% longer to vote and were 74% more likely to spend more than 30 minutes at their polling place\n\nAnd that is when the team found those in majority-black neighborhoods (as well as other non-white-majority neighborhoods) waited longer.\n\n'The median and average times spent at polling locations are 14 and 19 minutes, respectively, and 18% of individuals spent more than 30 minutes voting,' reads the study.\n\n'Average wait times vary from as low as \u223c 11 minutes in Massachusetts's sixth congressional district \u2014 primarily in Essex County \u2014 to as high as \u223c 41 minutes in Missouri's fifth congressional district, which contains Kansas City.'\n\nStill, the smartphone method does not answer a key question: 'What it doesn't tell us is why. What's going on here?' Robert Stein, a political scientist at Rice University, who did not participate in the new research, told Scientific America.\n\n'I would want to use it as a basis for doing further observational studies. You know, you just can't get that from the phone.'\n\nHowever, the researchers of the study believe their findings can be used for the greater good.\n\nSmartphone pings were collected from cellphone towers in the area. At the end of the collection, there was a sample of more than 150,000 voters at 40,000 polling locations\n\n'Exploiting the recent advent of large geospatial datasets, we provide new, nationwide estimates for the wait times of voters during the 2016 US presidential election,' according to the paper.\n\n'We find substantial and significant evidence of racial disparities in voter wait times, and detail that geospatial data can robustly estimate these disparities.'\n\n'This provides policymakers an easily available and repeatable tool to both diagnose and monitor progress towards reducing such disparities.'", "description": "Using smartphone pings and census data, experts have uncovered  racial differences in voting wait times.
