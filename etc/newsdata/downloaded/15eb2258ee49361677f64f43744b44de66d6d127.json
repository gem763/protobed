REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo\n\nAfter initial conversations in recent months between Saudi Arabia and governments in the Gulf and Asia, approaches to their sovereign wealth funds have started via the banks appointed to handle Aramco\u2019s initial public offering (IPO), the sources said.\n\nA meeting between Aramco\u2019s management and a team from Abu Dhabi\u2019s ADIA, the world\u2019s third-biggest sovereign wealth fund, was set up for October, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nA second source confirmed the approach to ADIA, while two other sources said GIC had been approached.\n\nAll the sources who spoke to Reuters asked to be anonymous as they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nAbu Dhabi\u2019s state investor Mubadala Investment Co, which has $229 billion under management, has also been approached by Aramco\u2019s advisers, two sources said.\n\nOne of the sources said the approaches were still at an early stage and some of the funds had yet to study the proposals before deciding whether to invest.\n\nAmong Gulf investors, Bahrain\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Mumtalakat was expected to consider investing in the IPO, another source said.\n\nADIA and Mubadala declined to comment, while Aramco and Mumtalakat did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe approaches to sovereign funds in countries on friendly terms with Saudi Arabia and wealthy Saudi families indicate bankers aimed to build an investor base to achieve the $2 trillion valuation targeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe listing is the centerpiece of the crown prince\u2019s plan to shake up the Saudi economy and diversify away from oil.\n\nThe talks show work on the IPO process is still proceeding despite uncertainty over the timeline following a Sept. 14 attack on Aramco\u2019s facilities.\n\nLOFTY TARGETS\n\nTo achieve the $2 trillion valuation, Aramco needs the initial listing of a 1% stake on the Saudi market to raise at least $20 billion. To beat the record for the world\u2019s biggest IPO, it needs to top Alibaba\u2019s sale of $25 billion of shares.\n\nBut bankers and company insiders have described the valuation as ambitious, due to a weak outlook for oil prices as deepening climate change activism could dampen investor interest, particularly in the Western world.\n\nA further risk to the $2 trillion target was raised by the Sept. 14 strikes that knocked out more than half the production of the world\u2019s top oil exporting nation. Saudi Arabia has been assuring investors it can quickly restore output.\n\nVarious sources said the kingdom has been busy looking for a more sympathetic investor base in the Middle East and Asia, while also seeking support from the wealthiest Saudi families.\n\n\u201cIt is a natural fit and many in the region would look at it favorably as they want a piece of the pie,\u201d a Gulf source said.\n\nPreparations for the IPO have gone through various stages since the 2016 announcement.\n\nIssues of governance and disclosure, the acquisition of a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp (2010.SE), disagreements among Saudi officials and advisers over the choice of an international listing venue, all contributed to a temporary halt last year.\n\nBankers from around 20 international and domestic financial institutions are now working on the company\u2019s plan to sell 1% in Riyadh before an international sale in 2020 or 2021.\n\nAfter securing support from sovereign funds, bankers would focus on Western institutional investors, another source said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no turning back now,\u201d one of the sources said, adding that Aramco was \u201cgoing ahead\u201d with the IPO.\n\nOne of the sources said Aramco could announce its intention to float on Oct. 20, with analysts\u2019 reports expected the same day. Analysts have been holding meetings at Aramco\u2019s headquarters in Dhahran this week.", "description": "State-owned Saudi Aramco has approached Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), Singapore's GIC and other sovereign wealth funds to invest in the domestic leg of the oil giant's listing at it seeks to achieve a $2 trillion valuation, sources said.", "authors": ["Clara Denina", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434120972&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0Z0", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
