That's when the \u201cModern Family\u201d actress shared a super throwback image of herself with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd from the trio\u2019s 1998 film, \u201cObject of My Affection.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn honor of @jenniferaniston getting an Instagram I\u2019m reposting this picture from almost 24 years ago,\u201d Hyland captioned the sweet photo. \u201cNeither she, Paul Rudd, nor myself have aged since 1996. I love ya fake mama! \u2764\ufe0f #objectofmyaffection.\u201d\n\nHyland, 28, posted her tribute to Aniston, now 50, after the \u201cFriends\u201d alum joined the social media platform and proceeded to break the algorithm that allowed people to follow her account. It wasn\u2019t long after Aniston shared her A-list-filled \u201cfriends\u201d selfie with the world that many users began seeing the message \u201cSorry, this page isn\u2019t available\u201d when attempting to follow her profile.\n\nAn Instagram representative told Page Six, \u201cWe are aware that some people are having issues following Jen's page -- the volume of interest is incredible! We are actively working on a solution and hope to have the page up and running smoothly again shortly.\u201d\n\nJENNIFER ANISTON SAYS A \u2018PAINFULLY WORDED\u2019 CRITICISM AT AGE 11 GAVE HER A VOICE\n\nHyland wasn\u2019t the only Aniston accomplice to honor the \u201cMurder Mystery\u201d actress on her social media christening. Aniston\u2019s on-screen friends, Courteney Cox and David Schwimmer, also created posts designed to welcome the actress to the platform.\n\nCox, who played Monica Geller, took to her own Instagram to share a photo of her and Aniston hugging.\n\n\u201cHi Jen!\u201d she captioned the image. \u201cWelcome to the social media world. \u2026 It sucks. You\u2019re gonna love it!\u201d\n\nJENNIFER ANISTON BASHES MARVEL: I'M NOT INTERESTED IN 'LIVING IN A GREEN SCREEN'\n\nWhile the line may sound like a jab at social media, it is actually a quote from the very first episode of \u201cFriends\u201d in which her character welcomes Aniston\u2019s Rachel Green to the \u201creal world.\u201d\n\nSchwimmer, who played Ross Geller, Cox's brother on the series, shared a photo of his own. It features what appears to be Lego versions of his and Aniston's characters at the famous, fictional Central Perk coffee shop that figured so prominently in the hugely popular sitcom.\n\n\u201cHi Jen! x,\u201d he captioned the snap.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAniston also managed to break a Guinness World Record, reaching a million followers on the platform faster than anyone. She got it done in five hours and 16 minutes, according to People.\n\nAccomplishing that feat placed her atop Prince Harry and Meghan Markle who held the title for all of six months when they opened their Instagram account on April.", "description": "Who\u2019s up for an early #ThrowbackThursday?", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Aniston-Hyland.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
