Come prepared with a sleeping bag, blanket or lawn chair.\n\nLie flat on your back with your feet facing southeast if you are in the Northern Hemisphere or northeast if you are in the Southern Hemisphere, and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible.\n\nIn less than 30 minutes in the dark, your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors.\n\nBe patient - the show will last until dawn, so you have plenty of time to catch a glimpse.\n\n(Image: Kev Lewis/Flickr Creative Commons)\n\nWhy is it called the Orionid meteor shower?\n\nMeteor showers are named after the region of the sky that they appear to come from (known as the radiant).\n\nIn the case of the Orionids, the radiant is the constellation Orion.\n\nHowever, you should not look only to the constellation of Orion to view the Orionids - they are visible throughout the night sky.\n\nIt is actually better to view the Orionids from 45 to 90 degrees away from the radiant, where they will appear longer and more spectacular.\n\nIf you do look directly at the radiant, you will find that the meteors will be short. This is an effect of perspective called foreshortening.", "description": "The spectacular meteor shower will peak later this month - here's how to watch it", "authors": ["Sophie Curtis", "Image", "Wales Online", "Nasa Jpl", "Kev Lewis Flickr Creative Commons"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article3807216.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Eta-Aquarid-Meteor-Shower-over-Mount-Bromo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
