The Premier League and TV companies repeatedly ignore the welfare of supporters.\n\n'A consequence of such a disdainful, zero-consideration change means LFC's following fixture, at home to Wolves, is also to be moved to Sunday 29 December, again with inconvenience and negative implications for fans and workers.'
