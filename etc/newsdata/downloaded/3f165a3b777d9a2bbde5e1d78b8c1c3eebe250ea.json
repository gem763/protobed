This time it\u2019s courtesy of Miranda Kerr, who already has a long history of dubious wellness practices that would put Goop to shame. The model-turned-entrepreneur has been open about her use of crystals and energy healing, and was rumored to have imbibed her freeze-dried placenta after giving birth. But a recently resurfaced interview, in which she describes her \u201cwellness musts,\u201d has unearthed a fresh spate of pseudoscientific health practices:\n\n\u201cWe have a lot. We have the air purifier. We have the stickers you put on the back of your phone for radiation. I have the EMF detector that picks up the waves in the air. I\u2019ve had the whole house checked by a professional who looks for things like EMF waves and things like that. I even have something installed in my Malibu house to turn out all the power while we sleep. It\u2019s basically a button that turns all the power off, except for the fridge and security cameras, in the nighttime. So when you go to sleep, you don\u2019t have any Wi-Fi or electricity in the house at all.\n\nIt\u2019s like going camping! I also have an alkaline water filter so I can pick the pH of our water. There\u2019s a lot of research on that \u2014 you don\u2019t want to be going too alkaline because you do need a little stomach acid to digest your food. I typically choose somewhere around the 7.5 to 7.9 mark for the water. Then I like using Palo Santo to clear the energy in the space, and I also have little diffusers around the house with essential oils, depending on what\u2019s going on. We even mop the floors with hot water and eucalyptus oil, which is what my mother used to do.\u201d\n\nYour move, Grimes.", "description": "Supermodel Miranda Kerr\u2019s \u201cwellness musts\u201d include radiation-detecting stickers and an EMF detector.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/24/24-miranda-kerr.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
