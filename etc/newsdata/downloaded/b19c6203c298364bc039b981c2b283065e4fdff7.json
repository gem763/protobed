The move comes after a prototype of its airborne shuttle achieved speeds of more than 62 mph (100 km/h) during tests in the firm's home town of Munich. The battery-powered craft has 36 motors built into an efficient fixed-wing design that is capable of taking-off vertically an expected to outperform the more drone-like offerings from Volocopter and Britain's Vertical Aerospace. 'We are taking tangible and concrete steps towards making our vision of regional air mobility a reality, and we are doing it on time,' said Lilium CEO Daniel Wiegand. The test flights come six months after the five-seater Lilium first staged a test 'hover' at an airfield in Munich. Lilium is currently testing its air taxi by remote control, but will bring in on-board pilots later to be certified airworthy. The Lilium is predicted as being able to complete a 186 mile (300 km) -long inter-city 'hop' in an hour \u2014 which would make it an affordable and emissions-free alternative to travelling by commercial airline, road or rail. The company already has a complete manufacturing facility in Munich, with a second under construction. These will enable the firm to make hundreds of craft every year by the middle of the next decade.
