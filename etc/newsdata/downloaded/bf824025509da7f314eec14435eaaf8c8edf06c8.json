It opens with the Robinson family marooned in a mysterious ocean world, months after the events of the first season's cliffhanger finale.\n\nThe Robinson family \u2013 mom Maureen Robinson (Molly Parker), dad John Robinson (Toby Stephens) and the kids, Judy (Taylor Russell), Penny (Mina Sundwall) and Will (Maxwell Jenkins) \u2013 along with outsiders Dr. Smith (Parker Posey) and Don West (Ignacio Serricchio) band together to make it back to the Resolute ship and the other colonists. JJ Feild (\"Captain America\") also joins the cast this season as Ben Adler, chief of advanced systems and artificial intelligence.\n\nAnd Will is determined to find \"his\" robot, as seen in a teaser released at Comic Con last weekend.\n\n\"Will in Season 1 is very different than Will in Season 2,\" says Jenkins, in an interview. \"We see him start to grow up in Season 1, and in Season 2, we see him become a completely different person.\"\n\nJenkins, 14, who grew up in a circus and says he does some of his own stunts, is changing right along with Will. He's grown about a foot in the past year, and Jenkins, 14, says he's been learning ways to keep his character interesting.\n\n\"It was about discovering how to keep the same heart of Will Robinson,\" Jenkins says, \"but also change who he is\" as he grows older.\n\nBut he's still in deep danger.\n\n\"Dr. Smith\" (Parker Posey) in a scene from \"Lost in Space\" season 2 on Netflix. (Photo: Courtesy of Netflix)\n\nMaureen and Dr. Smith have their own growing pains, dealing with consequences of their actions in the first season.\n\nThe series, geared to kids and families, is more epic adventure than non-stop action. The characters still struggle just to survive, but \"this season is more of a quest. It's more of a journey, and they have a plan,\" said writer and executive producer Burk Sharpless.\n\nFrom left, \"Lost in Space\" showrunner Zack Estrin, Taylor Russell who plays Judy Robinson, series writer Burk Sharpless, Molly Parker who plays Maureen Robison, Maxwell Jenkins who plays Will Robinson, JJ Feild who plays Ben Adler, Mina Sundwall who plays Penny Robinson, Ignacio Serricchio who plays Don West, Parker Posey who plays \"Dr. Smith\" and series writer Matt Sazama at New York Comic Con 2019.
