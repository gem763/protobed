One by one, hives stored in the branches of the trees are lowered to the ground and the honeycomb carefully removed.\n\nThe hives are then again restored high up in the canopy. The Steppe itself is massive, stretching from the Usambara to the Great Rift Valley across the borders of Kenya to Ethiopia.\n\nThis bee-keeping initiative is focused in the area outside the Tarangire National Park in Tanzania.\n\nMost of the people who live here are Maasai, many are are now semi-nomadic, raising cattle in the traditions which have lasted for centuries.\n\nThe women own and run their bee keeping operation as a business. Their initial funding in the form of micro grants and training comes from a non-profit organisation called African Wildlife and People (AWP).\n\nThe idea is that the women don't repay the organisation from the sale of their honey, but instead they agree to a commit their time and energies to conservation work.\n\nThis can be tree planting, village cleanups, or environmental education where the women go to schools and villages to talk about environmental problems and conservation.\n\nAccording to AWP attitudes towards conservation improves if local people are involved in these activities.\n\nSamson John Beah helps runs the beekeeping program for African People and Wildlife.\n\nHe says: \"Beekeeping is important for this Maasai community because they've demonstrated hard work and a long history of protecting the environment. Therefore, the beekeeping project is a venture that protects their environment while also securing some income for them, for their needs through selling honey and other beekeeping products.\n\nAccording to Beah: \"The objective of this project is both conservation and generating income from the environment.\"\n\nAWB believes rural women are the best to spread the message for sustainable development, that it argues is critical to long-term conservation success.\n\nIt says almost 1,200 women are involved with the schemes and there are now more than 1,300 hives being planted in the wild bush for harvesting.", "description": "This bee-keeping initiative inTanzania is giving 1,200 Maasai women financial independence, while turning them into conservationists of the land they live on.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/14/36/1000x563_cmsv2_4d4e81ec-5e0f-542b-acd6-12d41817cd19-4231436.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
