Australia came in third, with a B+ grade, and the top 10 was rounded out with Finland, Sweden, Norway, Singapore, New Zealand, Canada and Chile all on B.\n\nAustralia came in third, with a B+ grade. Bloomberg\n\nThe survey of 37 nations, which covers almost two-thirds of the world's population, uses 40 metrics to assess whether a system leads to improved financial outcomes for retirees, whether it is sustainable and whether it has the trust and confidence of the community.\n\nThe Netherlands again took the top spot in 2019 with most workers benefiting from defined benefit plans based on lifetime average earnings. The UK and the US both earned a C+ grade, coming in 14th and 16th place respectively. Both could boost their scores by raising the minimum pension for low-income pensioners, according to the report.\n\nJapan came in at No. 31 and was ranked with a D - a grade that reveals \"major weaknesses and/or omissions that need to be addressed\". A key recommendation included raising the state pension age as life expectancy continues to increase in the nation.
