However even with a reduced capacity and reasonable ticket prices starting at 60 Qatari rial (\u00a313), seats are still readily available.\n\nMake athletics great again: how does Coe ensure casual fans become converts? | Sean Ingle Read more\n\nSources have told the Guardian that only 50,000 tickets have been sold across the 10 days of action \u2013 and that migrant workers and children will be bused in to stop the stadium appearing more than half empty on TV. That is a far cry from the optimism displayed when tickets went on sale, with organisers promising that \u201cmomentum\u201d was building and that there had been \u201cregistrations of interest from literally all corners of the world\u201d.\n\nAn IAAF spokesperson accepted that ticket sales had been \u201cchallenging\u201d but said that nobody could have foreseen the boycott of Qatar by other gulf states, making it impossible for some fans in the region to watch the championships.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of free tickets being given away, the spokesperson added: \u201cSurely it is a good thing that communities across Qatar will be getting tickets? We believe it will inspire a whole new generation of fans into the sport.\u201d\n\nMore than 1,800 athletes from around 150 countries are expected to take part in the world championships, which will be held in the Middle East for the first time.\n\nHowever Doha is not one of the traditional hotbeds of the sport and the event takes place at a time of year when the season is usually over. Nonetheless the IAAF president, Seb Coe, has insisted that the championships will help track and field expand into new territories\n\nOrganisers have promised a raft of innovations for the event, including two miniature cameras in each starting block which will show the first pictures of athletes\u2019 faces in the 100m moments before they hear the starting pistol, and capture the explosion of energy as the athletes leave the blocks.", "description": "Ticket sales for the World Athletics Championships in Doha are far more sluggish than expected, making it highly likely that large numbers of free tickets will be given away", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc65764609bcdf316aaf35055ce9afcaac87feb6/0_117_5488_3294/master/5488.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b672cdaa70e6a4ee1efe7d196e38fcd0", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
