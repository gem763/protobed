The chickens these council members eat are raised a thousand times worse.'\n\nWHAT IS FOIE GRAS AND HOW IS IT MADE? Foie gras - literally meaning 'fat liver' in French - is a specialty food made from the fattened liver of a duck or goose. Foie gras is rich in flavor, and smooth and buttery in its consistency. The delicacy is produced by force-feeding geese or ducks in order to enlarge their livers. Force-feeding via a six inch tube inserted into the animal's mouth usually occurs 12- 18 days before the bird is slaughtered. The production method originated around 2500 BC, with ancient Egyptians deliberately fattening fowl before killing them. The practice has long been criticized by animal rights activists who say it is inhumane. A report from EU's Scientific Committee on Animal Health back in 1989 concluded that 'force feeding, as currently practised, is detrimental to the welfare of the birds'. Only five European countries still produce foie gras, including France, where the law states that the delicacy 'belongs to the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage' of the country.\n\nOringer says he serves about 100 pounds of foie gras at his Toro New York restaurant each and every week.\n\nMeanwhile, duck farmer Marcus Henley told the publication that animal rights activists 'are completely misrepresenting our farming practices'.\n\nHe claims he has invited city council members to his upstate New York farm so that they can see firsthand that his practices are humane.\n\nHenley says his ducks are fed a liquid mixture three times a day through a six inch tube that is five-eighths of an inch wide. Force feeding usually takes place 12 -18 days before slaughter.\n\nNew York City would be the second place in the United States to outlaw the sale of foie gras, after a ban on the production and import of the product went into full effect in California earlier this year.\n\nThe ban was first enacted in 2004, but was subject to two court challenges.\n\nMeanwhile, Chicago outlawed the sale of foie gras in 2006, before the law was overturned just two years later.\n\nIn 2014, India became the first country to issue a blanket ban on foie gras, causing dismay among the nation's top chefs.\n\nProduction of foie gras is banned in many other counties, although its import and sale is still legal.", "description": "Animal welfare advocates have long supported banning the sale of foie gras, claiming the practice of force-feeding a bird by sticking a tube down its throat is inhumane.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20386286-0-image-a-17_1572453453076.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
