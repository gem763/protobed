He moved within three homers for the most by a rookie, a mark set by Aaron Judge with 52 in 2017.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJeff McNeil also went deep for the Mets, who set a franchise record with 225 home runs this season.\n\nTrailing 4-3 going into the ninth, the Mets tied it on Brandon Nimmo's third hit, an RBI single off Jairo Diaz (5-4). After a walk to McNeil loaded the bases, Joe Harvey relieved and walked Alonso on four pitches to put New York ahead.\n\nAnother run scored on a double-play grounder and Seth Lugo (7-4) hit an RBI single in his first plate appearance of the season.\n\nRookie Sam Hilliard hit two home runs for the Rockies, connecting both times off Noah Syndergaard. Hilliard's first homer went an estimated 447 feet to right-center and his second drive gave the Rockies a 2-1 lead. Hilliard was recalled on Aug. 27 and homered in his debut that night.\n\nSyndergaard went 5 2/3 innings, giving up four runs on 10 hits and striking out six. Rene Rivera started at catcher - Syndergaard recently expressed his interest in pitching to someone other than regular starter Wilson Ramos.\n\nRamos pinch-hit for Rivera and drew a leadoff walk in the ninth to begin the Mets' rally.\n\nMcNeil hit his 22nd homer, tagging Jeff Hoffman in the first inning. Hoffman allowed two runs on five hits in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nStory continues\n\nMets: RHP Robert Gsellman (right triceps tightness) will throw off the mound again, manager Mickey Callaway said.
