HS2 is a high-speed rail line that will connect London with other UK cities.\n\nBradbrook, invoking the example women's suffrage activist Emmeline Pankhurst, then tried to smash a window with a hammer and screwdriver. She was later brought down by a police climber.\n\nAnother activist tried to lock herself to the transport ministry but was arrested.\n\nExtinction Rebellion, which uses civil disobedience to highlight the risks posed by climate change and the accelerating loss of plant and animal species, is midway through a new two-week wave of actions in cities around the world.\n\nPolice ordered a halt to all Extinction Rebellion protests in London on Monday (October 14) after a week of action, saying those who did not comply would be arrested. They have already made almost 1,500 arrests since the protests began.", "description": "Climate change activists, including one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, targeted Britain's transport ministry in central London on Tuesday (October 15) to protest against a proposed high-speed rail project known as HS2.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/41/42/1000x563_cmsv2_345df90e-9b6c-5ed1-b2ce-faa36d36aa54-4234142.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
