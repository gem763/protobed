As players we should try and get in his head as much as possible early to see how he wants the game to go to make sure we're not on his wrong side.\n\n'It's going to be a massive contest - we will let him do his thing. If we let him do his job the game should flow nicely.'\n\nFor his part, Garces thanked his colleagues as he accepted the honour of officiating the final on Tuesday morning. 'I am honoured and delighted to be appointed to referee the final,' he said.\n\nGarces was in charge for England's brilliant quarter-final victory over Australia in Oita\n\n'It is a dream as a referee, but this is a team sport, and as a team of four, we will be out there to do the best for the teams, the fans, the sport, but also the entire match officials team, selectors and support team, who have worked so hard over the last four years.'\n\nIt will be Garces' 11th World Cup match, and his 55th test match as a referee.\n\nSouth Africa have only won two of its last 11 test matches refereed by Garces, although one of them was the 19-16 semi-final victory.\n\nEngland's Wayne Barnes will take charge of the third-place play-off between New Zealand and Wales on Friday.\n\nSouth Africa's Jaco Peyper, who was not considered for the semi-finals after posing with Wales fans mocking his red card decision in their quarter-final win over France, will be one of his assistants, along with Pascal Gauzere of France, with Marius Jonker (South Africa) as TMO.", "description": "Jerome Garces will referee the Rugby World Cup final between England and South Africa\u00a0on Saturday- despite criticism of his role in Wales' semi-final exit on Sunday.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/04/20311190-0-image-a-7_1572324378417.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
