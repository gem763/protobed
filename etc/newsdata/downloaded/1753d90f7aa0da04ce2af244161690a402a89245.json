On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong, chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, officially proclaimed the new government in Tiananmen Square. \u201cWe have stood up,\u201d he told the world.\n\nBut his China was a wreck, ravaged by Japanese aggression and civil war. And Mao\u2019s policies exacerbated popular suffering. Cruelty to foes, intolerance toward criticism, ignorant certainty, dogmatic utopianism, and determination to rule or ruin characterized his reign. Although presented as the much beloved leader of the Chinese people, he lacked any empathy for them. To him, they were statistics, replaceable by future births.\n\nHis personal whims, dictates, and fantasies dominated the PRC. Barely a year after establishing the new communist state, he decided to intervene in the Korean War, making casualties out of hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers, including his son. A push for land reform resulted in the murder or exile of at least a million and probably many more landlords and better off peasants.\n\nShortly after the PRC\u2019s founding, he initiated a campaign against \u201ccounter-revolutionaries\u201d and other opponents, especially officials in the previous Nationalist government. He admitted 700,000 deaths, but the real toll reached as high as two million. He dismissed criticism of the human cost, contending that it was necessary to secure power. Subsequently he targeted supposed \u201ccapitalist\u201d elements, resulting in hundreds of thousands more deaths. He insisted that \u201cthe worst among them should be shot.\u201d Others were criticized and sent to labor camps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1956, he appeared to change course with the Hundred Flowers Campaign, inviting criticism of the government. Tired of the truth, he then targeted those who had attacked him. The Anti-Rightest Movement cost many lives, perhaps in the millions. The Great Leap Forward, begun in 1958, was an even greater catastrophe. An arbitrary shift of rural labor toward industrialization ultimately led to mass famine, with estimates of the number of dead ranging widely, 50 million at their top.\n\nFailure so vast could not be ignored and Mao found himself criticized by leading party figures the following year. Consequently he unleashed a purge in the guise of an offensive against \u201cright opportunism,\u201d in which many loyal party members were imprisoned and perhaps six million ultimately perished.\n\nHe eventually was pushed into a more ceremonial role, losing authority to more pragmatic colleagues. In 1966, he was nevertheless able to unleash the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Launched in the name of triggering \u201cpermanent revolution\u201d and reviving the CCP leadership, the campaign was a bloody mix of revenge and purge, civil strife and civil war. City dwellers were ordered to the countryside. Youthful \u201cRed Guards\u201d roamed the streets, destroying historical artifacts, torturing party officials, closing schools, and generating violent chaos.\n\nMao regained supreme power. Liu Shaoqi, China\u2019s president, was denounced as a \u201ccapitalist-roader,\u201d tortured, and put in prison, where he died. Defense Minister Lin Biao, Mao\u2019s expected successor, was killed in a plane crash, apparently while fleeing to the Soviet Union. Influential revolutionary Deng Xiaoping was purged\u2014twice. As many as 100 million people suffered in some way, and up to three million people died in the chaotic violence.\n\nMao had become the Red Emperor. His life after taking power, writes historian Daniel Leese, \u201creveals a certain temporal development from a down-to-earth leader, who was amicable when contested and occasionally reflected on the limits of his power, to an increasingly ruthless and self-indulgent dictator. Mao\u2019s preparedness to accept criticism decreased continuously.\u201d His almost whimsical decisions resulted in astonishing numbers of casualties\u2014estimates range from 35 million to 100 million\u2014making him likely the greatest mass killer in history.\n\nSome of his defenders contend that he did not intend many of those deaths. Others argue that his achievements were worth the price. Yet Mao exulted in his brutality. He compared himself to China\u2019s murderous first emperor Qin Shi Huang: \u201cWhat did he amount to? He only buried alive 460 scholars, while we buried 46,000.\u201d When musing about the possibility of nuclear war, he said, \u201cif the worst came to the worst and one-half dies, there will still be one-half left, but imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist.\u201d\n\nMichael Lynch observed in his 2004 biography of Mao: \u201cChina continues to benefit from a more favorable comparison with Cambodia or the Soviet Union. But as fresh and abundant archival evidence shows, coercion, terror and systematic violence were the foundation of the Great Leap, and between 1958 and 1962, by a rough approximation, some 6 to 8 percent of those who died were tortured to death or summarily killed\u2014amounting to at least 3 million victims.\u201d Li Rui, Mao\u2019s secretary, observed: \u201cMao\u2019s way of thinking and governing was terrifying. He put no value on human life. The deaths of others meant nothing to him.\u201d\n\nThe horror ended only with his death in September 1976. In the ensuing power struggle, Deng Xiaoping eventually gained control, earning the designation \u201cparamount leader.\u201d He abandoned Maoist economics and controls, opening the PRC to markets. His reforms began in 1979 and accelerated in the 1980s, triggering the nation\u2019s economic take-off and generating decades of rapid economic growth, which has moved an astonishing 800 million people out of poverty since 1978.\n\nChinese also began to enjoy personal autonomy, with the end of draconian controls over individuals\u2019 lives: they could marry freely, choose jobs, and accumulate wealth without Beijing\u2019s approval. There was also pressure for political liberalization, though Deng showed the limits of his commitment to reform with the murderous 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square.\n\nNor was Deng prepared to toss Mao into history\u2019s trash can. Deng judged Mao to be \u201c70 percent right and 30 percent wrong.\u201d The Red Emperor\u2019s body\u2014or wax double\u2014is preserved in a massive mausoleum in Tiananmen Square. His picture famously adorns the Gate of Heavenly Peace, on the square\u2019s north side. His image also graces China\u2019s currency. His family\u2019s home is preserved in Hunan Province, which is filled with Mao statues and images. And China\u2019s current leaders, including Xi Jinping, cite him frequently. Those who criticize the dead dictator risk retribution.\n\nDeng died in 1997. Despite his resistance to political reform, he attempted to prevent the rise of another Mao, placing term limits on the presidency, for instance. Deng\u2019s successors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, presided over a system of loose authoritarianism. The CCP could not be challenged, of course, but carefully calibrated criticism was tolerated.\n\nXi, who took over in 2013, is very different. He embarked upon a brutal campaign to strengthen the CCP\u2019s control of the state and through it oversight of the Chinese people. Internet censorship is tighter and broader. \u201cPatriotic\u201d education has been reintroduced in schools. Party cells have been imposed on joint ventures. Dissent has been suppressed. Human rights lawyers have been imprisoned. Churches have been closed. NGOs have been shuttered. Academic exchanges have been restricted. Economic oversight has been expanded. A system of \u201csocial credit\u201d has been created to punish those who defy norms set by the CCP.\n\nMoreover, Xi has dramatically enhanced his own authority. Gone are presidential term limits. Xi\u2019s thoughts have been incorporated into the country\u2019s constitution. His picture is widely displayed. He\u2019s even been mimicking Mao, with publications calling him \u201cthe people\u2019s leader,\u201d the Red Emperor\u2019s oft-used moniker.\n\nNevertheless, it is important not to overstate the supposed \u201cChina Threat.\u201d Policy and practice could change again, in a more liberal direction. The PRC faces substantial economic challenges that could exacerbate political divisions. The Chinese population is aging rapidly and suffers from a dearth of women, the result of the CCP\u2019s now-repealed \u201cone-child\u201d policy. Xi\u2019s authority is substantial, but he has accumulated an extraordinary number of enemies.\n\nChina is investing and trading around the world to its obvious economic benefit; the political consequences are more mixed, however, with the PRC suffering blowback from its perceived arrogance and abuse. The famed \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d is as likely to leave Beijing a pile of unpaid debts as a network of vital bases. Increased pressure on Hong Kong and Taiwan have only driven their populations further away while harming the PRC\u2019s international reputation.\n\nThe creation of the PRC was an epochal event. Seventy years on, Chinese communism has proved to be resilient, but only because it no longer is recognizable. Observed eminent Chinese economist Mao Yushi (no relation to the Red Emperor), \u201cThe idea of communism is a tragedy, a disaster.\u201d The key to the PRC\u2019s survival was casting off the stultifying controls on its own people.\n\nXi\u2019s race into his nation\u2019s totalitarian past is a dangerous detour. Washington should work with like-minded states to offer China a better path: empowering its people, limiting regime threats, and emphasizing cooperation over confrontation whenever possible. Because in celebrating the past, Beijing risks losing the future.\n\nDoug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.
