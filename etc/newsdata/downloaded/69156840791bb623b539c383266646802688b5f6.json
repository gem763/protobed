It was interesting Nigel Owen didn\u2019t rule it initially,\u2019 said Woodward on ITV during half-time.\n\n\u2018We get really quick ball. The key guy is [Tom] Curry, if he can just stay behind [Kyle] Sinckler it\u2019s not going to be a penalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If he goes in front of him and there\u2019s no contact with the All Blacks players it\u2019s all fine.\n\n\u2018When we scored our first try I leapt up but I didn\u2019t on this occasion. There was just too big a gap so something had happened.\n\n\u2018To be fair the referee didn\u2019t panic, got the right call from the TMO but it was so close. If he had just stayed behind the ball it\u2019s a try.\u2019\n\nTom Curry ran ahead of Sinckler to create the opening for Underhill (Picture: ITV)\n\nEngland did manage to add three more points just before half-time through the boot of George Ford but had another try ruled out at the start of the second half, with Owens explaining the decision to skipper Owen Farrell.\n\n\u2018The TMO has a clear view that he\u2019s in front of him. It is lost by your player, but the guy who gathers it is in front of him, so that\u2019s why we can\u2019t allow the try,\u2019 said the Welsh ref.\n\n\u2018Owen please listen to my explanation. The TMO has confirmed. The player behind loses control of it and it\u2019s taken by the player in front of him, therefore we cannot allow the try because he\u2019s in front. If he was behind, no issues.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Former England head coach Sir Clive Woodward has backed Nigel Owens\u2019 decision to disallow a try for England in the first half of their Rugby World Cup semi-final against New...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1183529794_1572081798.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
