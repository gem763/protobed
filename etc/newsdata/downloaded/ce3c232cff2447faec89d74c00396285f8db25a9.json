Chuck Schumer. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Congress Schumer urges McConnell to renegotiate spending proposal\n\nSenate Democratic leaders on Tuesday will urge Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) to renegotiate their proposals to fund the government and avoid a shutdown.\n\nIn a letter obtained by POLITICO, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Senate Appropriations Ranking Member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and other top Democrats, warned that Republicans \u201care pursuing the same path that led to last year\u2019s 35-day government shutdown\u2014funding the President\u2019s controversial, ineffective wall no matter the cost to the American people.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP\u2019s spending plans for fiscal year 2020 \u201csteal $5 billion\u201d from the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education bill for the border wall and that the proposal would allow the president to take an additional $7.2 billion from military construction projects.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have long made clear that we will not support appropriations bills that include these funding allocations,\u201d the Democrats wrote.\n\n\u201cWe ask that you immediately begin working with us to secure bipartisan bicameral 302(b) spending allocations that better reflect our shared commitments to, among many other things, the health of our veterans, funding critical science and technology initiatives, the education of our children, and the safety of our communities.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have bristled at the Democratic complaints, with McConnell saying earlier Tuesday that he saw \"troubling signals from the Democratic side.\"\n\n\u201cMy Democratic colleagues seem eager to bog down the funding process with all their outstanding disagreements with the president,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday morning. \"Whatever rationale my colleagues across the aisle may offer for these new disruptions, let\u2019s get one thing straight: holding defense funding hostage for political gain is a losing strategy.\"\n\nThe letter comes ahead of a test vote Wednesday set up by Mitch McConnell on a House-passed spending package that is expected to fail.\n\nShelby told reporters Tuesday that the upper chamber will then \u201ckeep trying to move bills that will be successful\u201d after Wednesday\u2019s ill-fated procedural vote.\n\nSumming up the GOP\u2019s strategy, Shelby said the procedural vote on Wednesday will put Democrats on record as voting against a motion to bring up funding for the military.\n\nIn addition to Schumer and Leahy, Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) also signed the letter.\n\nCaitlin Emma contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "Senate Democrats accused Republicans of \"pursuing the same path that led to last year\u2019s 35-day government shutdown.\"", "authors": ["Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d3/91/84aff8664eef92f893097191f374/190917-chuck-schumer-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
