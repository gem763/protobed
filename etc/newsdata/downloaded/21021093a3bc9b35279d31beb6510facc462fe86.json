I\u2019m excited to go out there and be cheering them on,\u201d said Delle Donne, the WNBA MVP. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of magic going on in the city right now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDelle Donne and her teammates, along with General Manager/Coach Mike Thibault, were honored on the field shortly before first pitch. They watched a video tribute, and Delle Donne received an ovation as she tossed the first pitch.\n\nThis is becoming a trend for D.C. champions. The Washington Capitals visited the ballpark three days after winning the Stanley Cup in June 2018 with captain Alex Ovechkin memorably needing two throws to reach home plate with his ceremonial first pitch. Delle Donne needed just one. She waved her arms and pumped up the crowd as she walked off the mound.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really cool doing our little victory tour,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has certainly sunk in. And it feels so good.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The newly christened WNBA champions continued their victory tour at Nationals Park.", "authors": ["Roman Stubbs", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OVRMcsdvjbxr4Ej0NdQIv8nAiXg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/22JVDGHPVAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
