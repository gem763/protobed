The water had risen so high there was no way to move on the ground.\n\n\u201cIt came and swept through and carried everything in its path,\u201d said his father, Pastor Pedyson Baillou, who relayed his son\u2019s account and waited out the storm in Freeport. \u201cThat\u2019s life in front of you.\u201d\n\nHurricane Dorian roared into the northwestern Bahamas as the strongest storm on modern record to hit the area. It hovered for days, unleashing winds up to 185 miles an hour and drenching communities. It killed at least 30 people, said Xavier Knowles, public-relations officer for the Ministry of Health, and officials have said they expect that number to increase as rescue and recovery efforts continue.\n\nOn Friday, residents of this island, among the hardest hit, were waiting to get out. Some were waiting for medical attention, and others were waiting for food and water.\n\nPedro Baillou and a family member inspecting the damage of their home in High Rock on Grand Bahama Island.\n\nA line of cars trying to get into Freeport Harbor stretched more than a mile, as residents waited to get on boats to Nassau and Miami, away from the devastation left by Dorian. Some cruise lines were offering free evacuations to the many people left homeless.\n\nResidents also waited in line at the port to retrieve incoming supplies, which are being delivered by cruise ships and international aid groups on chartered boats.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard crews, which had rescued 239 people in the Bahamas as of Friday afternoon, are continuing to help with search and rescue missions, area assessments and logistical support, the Coast Guard said.\n\nBefore Dorian, Freeport was the main city on this island, known as a port for luxury cruise lines, sandy beaches and shopping. Grand Bahama has a population of about 51,000 people. The Abacos, a chain of islands with a population of about 17,000, was also hit hard by the hurricane.\n\nHigh Rock, a community of roughly 600 people in central Grand Bahama, is almost entirely destroyed. Most homes have been all but erased from the landscape and the few left standing reveal mangled interiors.\n\nMost residents say they have heard some 20 of their neighbors are still unaccounted for. Many say they have run low on food and water and have little certainty of when more supplies will arrive. A pallet of fresh water bottles arrived Friday afternoon.\n\nHurricane damage in High Rock.\n\nRoyal Caribbean employees load aid supplies.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s alive, they\u2019re making the best of what they could make. And who\u2019s gone\u2026they\u2019re just gone,\u201d said Sean Roberts, who was riding in the back of a pickup truck to retrieve his parents and best friend from their hometown.\n\nWilliam Cooper had lived in the same home in High Rock since 1956. It is gone now. A carpenter by trade who turns 82 this weekend, Mr. Cooper sat quietly on one of the small stubs of foundation left Friday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just start over again. And thank god for my life,\u201d he said.\n\nA few people say they clung to trees for days before the storm waters receded. Joey Sands, a 61-year-old pastor, said he and his 25-year-old son were blown off the roof of their home by a massive wave and each held tight to the tops of pine trees.\n\n\u201cIf there hadn\u2019t been water there, those trees would have snapped. The water supported the trees,\u201d he said.\n\nEric Baillou, an industrial mechanic and local councilman living in High Rock, said he spent two nights during the hurricane on the bathroom floor with his daughter, his feet kept pressed against the door for most of two days so wind might not blow it over. The ceiling came down in other rooms, and a pillow and blankets line the bathtub where they have slept.\n\nThe storm came just as many residents were preparing for peak tourism season.\n\nHigh Rock residents survey damage.\n\nPastor Pedyson Baillou at the site of his house which was left to the foundation after Hurricane Dorian.\n\n\u201cOur season starts in about three weeks,\u201d said Jasmon Rolle, who was sitting on a bench near the main road, waiting for food. \u201cEverybody was hoping to get back to work.\u201d\n\nBut some residents weren\u2019t ready to return to work. Renee Cooper, who was rescued from her home by a cousin, said she wasn\u2019t mentally prepared to return to her work at an immigration consultancy. \u201cI\u2019m basically homeless now,\u201d she said.\n\nJavon Pinder said he was trying to set up a tent in his yard that could become a base for supplies and relief for the neighborhood. But, so far, not many supplies have come in, he said.\n\n\u201cI was a bit disappointed when I saw the bus come up full of people yesterday but with no food and water,\u201d he said. He said he understands the difficulties in reaching High Rock, given the condition of the roads. He was hopeful more supplies would arrive soon.\n\nWrite to Will Parker at will.parker@wsj.com", "description": "Hurricane Dorian roared into the northwestern Bahamas as the strongest storm on modern record to hit the area.
