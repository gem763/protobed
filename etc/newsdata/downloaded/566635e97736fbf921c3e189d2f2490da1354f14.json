The state is largely rural, and that tends to correspond to more conservative views. However, the state also elected a Democrat for governor.\n\nThen again, the state also sided with President Trump over Hillary Clinton to the tune of 56.4 percent to 35.7 percent. The Democrats got trounced in 2016.\n\nSo, it would sound like while the state voted for a Democrat, they probably voted for one who was fairly conservative, right?\n\nWell, you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nI am a hunter and a gun owner. No hunter needs a 30-round magazine, a bump stock, or an assault weapon. A large majority of Americans \u2013 Republican and Democrat \u2013 agree. https://t.co/kL48omojv6 \u2014 Steve Bullock (@GovernorBullock) October 21, 2019\n\nMore than a year ago, I asked Donald Trump what he's doing to end the gun violence epidemic in our country. His answer wasn't good enough then \u2014 and his leadership isn't good enough now.\n\npic.twitter.com/MINv4190QQ \u2014 Steve Bullock (@GovernorBullock) October 21, 2019\n\nAlright, so let\u2019s address these tweets one at a time. First, the idea that hunters don\u2019t need 30-round magazines.\n\nBullock is right on that. Hunters don\u2019t need 30-round mags.\n\nHowever, the Second Amendment is an insurance policy on liberty. It\u2019s a tool meant to make sure that the American people have the weapons necessary to defend their nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\n\nFor that purpose, people do need 30-round magazines and much larger ones too. We need anything and everything we can to make sure liberty is safe. That may mean safe from a foreign invader or a would-be tyrant duly elected by the American people. The Founding Fathers were quite adamant about that.\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about his mention of the \u201cgun violence epidemic\u201d in this country. Mostly, let\u2019s talk about how it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nNow, I get that Bullock\u2019s nephew was killed after being shot. That\u2019s awful, and I\u2019m not going to pretend otherwise. However, personal anecdotes do not make an epidemic. If so, there\u2019s an epidemic of people losing power in the middle of the night because that happened at my house on Monday morning in the wee hours.\n\nThe fact is that violent crime is down and has been trending down since the 1990s. At the same time, so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d became the most popular firearms in the country as well as the time when more people were carrying firearms concealed. If the anti-gun rhetoric Bullock seems inclined to embrace were to be believed, we should see more violence.\n\nHell, Bullock himself believes we\u2019re in the midst of a gun violence epidemic, despite violent crime dropping and continuing to drop.\n\nThen again, it\u2019s important to remember that Bullock is running for president.\n\nI know I was surprised to hear that too. So is most of the rest of the nation, apparently, since he\u2019s polling at 0.3 percent according to RealClearPolitics. To call that well within the margin of error is a bit of an understatement. When you look at Marianne Williamson and long for her numbers, you know you\u2019re in trouble as a candidate.\n\nSo, he thought he\u2019d throw around some gun control rhetoric, throw around his anecdote about his nephew, and pretend that he somehow matters in this discussion and campaign.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ll vehemently oppose any public figure calling for restrictions on the rights of ordinary Americans, especially when they\u2019re peddling BS that directly infringes on our right to self-defense.\n\nThe only saving grace is that all Bullock can do is talk. He\u2019ll never get the chance to follow through.", "description": "Montana Governor Steve Bullock is running for president, which is surprising to hear, but he's also calling for a magazine capacity limit.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
