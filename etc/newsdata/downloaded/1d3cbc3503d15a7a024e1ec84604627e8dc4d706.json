But some of the fish who live there may be able to see colors thanks to a newly discovered visual system that\u2019s never been seen in vertebrates before.\n\nThe find, reported in the journal Science, challenges long-held assumptions about how these animals perceive colors.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect this at all,\u201d said study co-leader Fabio Cortesi, a marine biologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Whoa, what\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d\n\nChristopher Kenaley, a biologist at Boston College who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said the report should prompt scientists to reconsider the conventional wisdom that deep-sea fish have very limited vision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some important questions in the deep sea about how animals communicate down there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis gives us insight about how they might be able to detect one another.\u201d\n\nVertebrate vision is made possible by photoreceptor cells in the back of the eye. These cells \u2014 called rods and cones \u2014 include pigment proteins that detect different types of light and relay that information to the brain.\n\nThe yellow light-filtering lens of a deep-sea oceanic basslet. Yellow filtering pigments and lenses are found in a number of deep-sea fish eyes and are thought to enhance contrast against the residual daylight. (Dr. Wen-Sung Chung, University of Queensland)\n\nA typical vertebrate eye has multiple types of cones that work in bright conditions \u2014 each capable of sensing a certain range of colors \u2014 and one type of rod that senses light when the environment is dim. The rods can\u2019t distinguish between colors because they all have the same pigment protein, which is why humans and most other animals are said to be colorblind at night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCortesi and his colleagues wondered if they could find some exceptions among fish who lived in perpetually dark environments. Their question was prompted by a 2015 study of mostly shallow-water fish that turned up several species with more genes for cone pigment proteins than scientists had expected.\n\n\u201cWe just thought if other fish are more variable in their visual system than previously thought, we should look at the deep-sea fishes,\u201d said Walter Salzburger, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland who oversaw both the 2015 study and the new one. After all, if any fish stood to benefit by having more ways to see in dark conditions, it would be fish that live in water so deep that light barely reaches them.\n\nVery little is known about fish that reside more than 1,000 meters below sea level. Some developed large pupils and very long rods help them catch whatever light is around. (At those depths, most of the light is produced by fish themselves through bioluminescence.)\n\nFor the new study, the researchers started by counting the number of genes for both rod and cone pigment proteins in the genomes of 101 species of fish living in a diverse array of habitats. Although they found a dozen species with up to seven cone pigment genes, what really struck them was the discovery of 13 species that had more than one rod pigment gene.\n\nFour of those species stood out with five or more of the genes: the tube-eye (Stylephorus chordatus), the glacier lanternfish (Benthosema glaciale), the longwing spinyfin (Diretmoides pauciradiatus) and the silver spinyfin (Diretmus argenteus).\n\nAn assortment of deep-sea fishes with enhanced vision: silver spinyfin (top), lanternfish (middle) and tube-eye (bottom). (Pavel Riha, University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice)\n\nAll four of these fish live 1,000 meters to 2,000 meters below sea level. Their most recent common ancestor dates to more than 100 million years ago, so the researchers think the additional genes evolved independently in each lineage.\n\n\u201cIs it to see prey species? Or to find mates in a completely dark, or almost dark, environment? Or to avoid predators?\u201d Salzburger said. \u201cThese are the three main evolutionary advantages we can think of.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut were these fish actually using their extra pigment proteins? To answer that question, the team examined specimens representing 36 different fish species. Some tissue samples were already preserved in laboratories, and others were acquired on fishing expeditions.\n\nCortesi and other researchers dragged a net through the ocean from Perth to Sri Lanka. They trawled at night so the fish wouldn\u2019t encounter sunlight that might damage their eyes. It could take six hours to fill just one little bucket of the thumb-size fish, Cortesi said.\n\nMost of the 36 species had only one active gene for producing rod pigment proteins. The species with at least five rod pigment genes had at least three that were active.\n\nThe star was the silver spinyfin. It had 38 genes for rod pigment proteins, and 14 of those proteins were actually at work inside the eye. (For the sake of comparison, most humans use only three types of cone pigment proteins to see the world in color.)\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the silver spinyfin uses all of these rod pigments, but the scientists suspect they may increase their sensitivity to light, Salzburger said.\n\nTo get an idea of what colors the silver spinyfin might see, the researchers enlisted bacteria to reproduce some of its rod pigment proteins in a petri dish. Then they shined a light on each of them to see what portion of the spectrum the pigment proteins were able to absorb. They found that they could detect light across the entire spectrum of bioluminescence \u2014 from different shades of blue and green to yellow.\n\nFinally, they used those results to predict the colors other deep-water fish with multiple rod pigment proteins could see. The shapes of those proteins were the key, since different shapes are sensitive to different wavelengths of light.\n\nTheir work suggested that the lantern fish, tube-eye and longwing spinyfin probably could detect blue light, as well as shades of green and yellow-green. But they would not have as wide a range as the silver spinyfish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout behavioral experiments, the scientists can\u2019t know for sure whether these fish really do use their rods to see color. The experiments would be difficult to pull off because the fish aren\u2019t just hard to get, they don\u2019t live long once they are brought to the surface, Salzburger said. (The water pressure at sea level is much lower than what they\u2019re used to in the deep ocean.)\n\nNevertheless, scientists who were not involved in the study agreed that identifying fish with multiple rod pigment proteins was a novelty in itself.\n\nBiologist David Hunt, a professor emeritus at the University of Western Australia who has specialized in the evolution of vertebrate vision, called its findings \u201cquite astounding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is something that is unknown and really totally unexpected,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to get my head around really what it means.\u201d", "description": "In the depths of the oceans, there are fish equipped with a previously unknown visual system that may allow them to see color in the inky blackness.", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Leila Miller Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times.
