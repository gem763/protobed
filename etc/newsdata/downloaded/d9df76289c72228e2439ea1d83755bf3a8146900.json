September\u2019s reading compared with a consensus forecast for 94.4.\n\n\u201cThe downturn is taking a breather,\u201d Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. But he added: \u201cIn manufacturing, the business climate has only one direction: downward.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s export-reliant economy is suffering from slower global growth and business uncertainty caused by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 trade policies and Britain\u2019s planned, but delayed, exit from the European Union.\n\nIfo\u2019s current conditions index rose to 98.5 from 97.4 in August but its expectations index fell to 90.8 from 91.3.\n\nIfo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said the German economy is likely to shrink again in the third quarter.\n\nThat would put it in recession - usually defined as a period of at least two consecutive quarters of contraction - after it shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThis is not the start of a change of trend,\u201d Wohlrabe said of Tuesday\u2019s firmer overall sentiment reading. \u201cThe slowdown is only taking a break,\u201d he told Reuters, adding that no signs of improvement were to be seen for German industry.\n\nEconomy Minister Peter Altmaier, speaking immediately after the release of the Ifo data, said Germany\u2019s growth dynamics have deteriorated but insisted: \u201cWe are not in a recession.\u201d\n\nMuch of the German economy\u2019s fortunes are tied up in factors beyond its control: mainly weaker global growth, developments in the U.S.-China trade conflict and the question of whether Britain can achieve an orderly exit from the European Union.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for trade talks in two weeks.\n\nOn Brexit, EU negotiator Michel Barnier struck a downbeat note on Tuesday, saying there was no reason to be optimistic that Britain and the bloc will find a solution to the thorny question of the Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d.\n\nRECESSION RISK RISING\n\nING economist Carsten Brzeski said the likelihood of a third quarter contraction in Germany was rising \u201calmost by the day\u201d.\n\nOn Monday, a purchasing managers\u2019 survey showed that German private sector activity shrank for the first time in 6-1/2 years in September as a manufacturing recession deepened unexpectedly and growth in the service sector lost momentum.\n\nHighlighting the weakness in the manufacturing sector, engineering lobby group VDMA also said on Monday production in Germany\u2019s engineering sector will decline by 2% both this year and in 2020. It cited trade conflicts and uncertainties linked to Britain\u2019s planned exit from the EU.\n\n\u201cWhile a \u2018light\u2019 technical recession is not the end of the world for an economy which has been growing for more than 10 years and has an unemployment rate at all-time lows, it is the lack of any signals of an imminent rebound which is more concerning,\u201d Brzeski said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The skyline with its financial district is photographed early evening in Frankfurt, Germany, October 8, 2018.
