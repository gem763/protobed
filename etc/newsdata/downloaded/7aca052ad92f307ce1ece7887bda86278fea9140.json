Even Hastings now admits that the launch of new, competing streaming services will hurt Netflix\u2019s growth.\n\nSentiment has shifted. There are currently 22 million shares sold short (5% of the float), a 60% increase since the beginning of 2019. While the \u201csell side\u201d remains bullish, with 70% of Wall Street analysts tracked by FactSet calling Netflix a buy, independent investors are increasingly skeptical of the company\u2019s growth story.\n\nRead: Goldman Sachs stays bullish on Netflix, but cuts price target below Street average\n\nWithout positive sentiment to prop it up, Netflix stock remains highly overvalued and a serious risk to shareholders. We warned three months ago that the stock was overvalued after it fell to $325 after disappointing second-quarter earnings. As growth slows due to new competition over the next two years, the stock could fall to $118 a share, a 57% downside to the current stock price.\n\nThere are four key elements to our argument.\n\nCompetitors are cheaper and offer more content than Netflix\n\nWhen Netflix first pushed into original content in 2013, it had a significant first-mover advantage. Traditional networks and studios either lacked the expertise to build their own streaming platforms, or they were unwilling to sacrifice the money they earned from licensing their content to Netflix.\n\nThat\u2019s all changed. Disney DIS, +0.53%, Warner Media T, +0.43% and NBCUniversal CMCSA, +2.36% are all pulling their content from Netflix to launch their own streaming services, Amazon AMZN, +0.68% is increasing its content budget, and Apple AAPL, +2.66% just announced the launch of its Apple TV+ service, which will be free for the first year for customers who buy an Apple device.\n\nMonthly Price for Streaming Services in the U.S.\n\nNetflix now operates in a crowded space where it is one of the most expensive options. For the same $12.99 monthly price as Netflix, consumers can get a bundle of Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+. For $10 a month, they can get Prime Video \u2014 along with all the other perks of Prime membership.\n\nThe steady loss of licensed content means Netflix no longer has a larger content library than its peers. Amazon has the largest content library, and the Disney bundle\u2019s collection of classic movies, family-friendly entertainment, prestige TV and live sports gives it a breadth of options Netflix can\u2019t match.\n\nSubscriber growth is already slowing\n\nNetflix is already struggling to maintain its growth before these new competitors launch. The company added just 2.7 million subscribers in the second quarter, its slowest growth rate in three years, as shown in Figure 2. Despite these poor results, Netflix continues to project it will add seven million subscribers in the third quarter.\n\nQuarterly subscriber growth: 2016-2019\n\nSources: Netflix investor relations\n\nFor the first time since the company began its original content push, net subscriber additions through the first half of 2019 (12.3 million) were less than the first half of the prior year (13.8 million in 2018). In the higher-margin U.S. business, the number of subscribers actually declined by 130,000 in the second quarter. This represents a decline of less than 1%, but the fact that the company\u2019s domestic subscriber base appears to have peaked is bad news for Netflix investors.\n\nThe pressure on the company\u2019s domestic subscriber base will only increase with the launch of new competitors. Disney+, which launches in November, received so much preorder interest that the website crashed.\n\nA recent report from Evercore ISI suggests the company\u2019s international growth has continued to struggle in the third quarter, with international downloads of its app up only 5% year-over-year in September. The company faces less competition internationally, so this slowing growth suggests its total addressable market may be lower than bulls believe. With competitors (like Hulu) preparing their own international rollouts, we expect Netflix\u2019s international business to start to plateau soon as well.\n\nMore: As Netflix earnings nears, here comes an onslaught of competition \u2014 and content\n\nCost increases will only get worse\n\nIncreased competition doesn\u2019t just hurt subscriber growth. It also increases the costs to produce, license, and market its content.\n\nNetflix has increased the amount of money it pays to content creators in order to secure them to long-term contracts. It recently paid a reported $300 million to secure the services of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. It also recently lost out to Amazon in its bid to sign recent Emmy winner Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\n\nNetflix also continues to invest a significant amount of money in its licensed content library, contrary to executives\u2019 claims that the company\u2019s original content is enough to satisfy its subscribers. It recently paid $500 million to license \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d This price is more than the amount paid for \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cFriends,\u201d two shows with a broader appeal.\n\nMoreover, the increased competition from rival media companies will make it harder for Netflix to advertise to consumers.\n\nThe company\u2019s marketing costs have already been increasing, from $824 million (12% of revenue) in 2015 to $2.4 billion (15% of revenue) in 2018. As other media companies restrict the potential supply of advertising space for Netflix, its marketing costs should grow even higher as it\u2019s forced to turn to less efficient forms of advertising.\n\nValuation remains irrational\n\nFinally, despite the stock\u2019s 30% decline over the past three months, Netflix remains significantly overvalued. Our reverse DCF model quantifies the growth expectations implied by its stock price.\n\nTo justify its current stock price of around $273 a share, Netflix must achieve a 12% after-tax operating profit (NOPAT) margin (up from 8% in the trailing 12 months) and grow NOPAT by 23% compounded annually for 15 years. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.\n\nBy comparison, Disney\u2019s $130-a-share valuation implies that it will grow NOPAT by just 4% compounded annually for the next 15 years. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.\n\nAs Figure 3 shows, their respective valuations imply that Netflix, which currently earns around $1.5 billion in NOPAT compared to around $10 billion for Disney, will earn around $9 billion more than Disney 15 years from now.\n\nHistorical vs. implied NOPAT growth: Netflix vs Disney\n\nSources: New Constructs and company filings\n\nThe stock price still implies that Netflix can grow at an exponential rate over the long term, even though subscriber growth is already plateauing. This slowing growth, along with mounting competition, makes it even harder to justify the overblown valuation.\n\nIf Netflix grows NOPAT by 17% compounded annually for the next 15 years, the stock is worth just $118 a share today, a 57% downside to the current stock price.This scenario assumes Netflix\u2019s revenue growth rate will taper from 28% in 2019 to below 10% over the long term. In effect, it assumes that growth will be linear, rather than exponential. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.\n\nNow read: Why no streaming company will be able to dethrone Netflix\n\nDavid Trainer is the CEO of New Constructs, an independent equity research firm that uses machine learning and natural language processing to parse corporate filings and model economic earnings.
