Here is what we know so far.\n\nThe status of the investigation\n\nOn Saturday, police charged the driver of the refrigerated truck, a 25-year-old from Northern Ireland, with manslaughter, people trafficking, immigration offenses and money laundering. Police initially arrested him on Wednesday and did not release his name, though some U.K. media have identified him citing local sources and social media.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, police also arrested three people: a 38-year-old man and woman from Warrington, England, and a 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland, the latter whom they stopped at England\u2019s Stansted Airport. They were held \u201con suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn the meantime, police are in contact with Chinese and Vietnamese authorities as they work to identify the victims and how they got there. They have appealed to the public to share any information.\n\n\u201cIn addition to determining the identities of the victims \u2014 eight women and 31 men \u2014 authorities are trying to figure out how they died and whether organized crime groups were involved. Postmortem examinations of 11 of the dead were due to start Friday afternoon,\u201d The Post reported.\n\nThe victims\n\nEssex police said Saturday that the bodies of all 39 victims have been removed from the truck container and are now in a mortuary awaiting autopsies, the Associated Press reported. The victims had few documents on them (as smugglers usually confiscate any identification) and none have been officially identified.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut some frantic families in Vietnam believe their loved ones are among the dead.\n\nU.K. police initially suspected the victims were Chinese nationals. Then, Vietnamese families began contacting authorities after being unable to reach relatives who they knew were traveling to Britain around the same time as the truck.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mom. My journey abroad hasn\u2019t succeeded,\u201d Pham Thi Tra My, 26, messaged her family back in Vietnam on Tuesday night. \u201cMom, I love you so much! I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nAround 70 percent of Vietnamese citizens trafficked into the U.K. between 2009 and 2016 were caught in labor exploitation, such as producing cannabis and working in bars, a British government report last year found. Women and girls from rural areas are at particular risk of trafficking, according to the report.\n\nMany of the victims may have come from Nghe An, one of Vietnam\u2019s poorest provinces and where many are trafficked to Europe, and Ha Tinh, where an environmental disaster at a steel mill last year destroyed much of the local economy, pushing more than 40,000 people to leave in the first eight months of 2019, according to Reuters, citing local media.\n\nHeartbroken relatives of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung in a village in Nghe An province told Reuters on Saturday that they think she is among the dead.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are waiting and hoping it\u2019s not her among the victims, but it\u2019s very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two people from my village traveling in that group,\u201d said Nhung\u2019s cousin, Hoang Thi Linh.\n\nNhung, who has relatives in the U.K., had posted a photo on Facebook on Monday and a friend had commented under it, asking how the trip was going.\n\n\u201cNot good,\u201d Nhung had written back. \u201cAlmost spring,\u201d she added, a Vietnamese phrase meaning that she was close to her destination.\n\nAnother Vietnamese family who suspects their relative, Nguyen Dinh Tu, is one of the victims told Reuters that he had incurred a large debt to be smuggled to Europe for work. Extended family in the U.K. was supposed to pick Tu up from a drop-off point \u2014 but he never arrived.\n\nThe route of the truck\n\nAmbulance services found the tractor-trailer early Wednesday morning in an industrial site about 25 miles east of central London, The Post reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was registered to an Irish citizen in Varna, Bulgaria \u2014 a Black Sea port city known to be on a smuggling route into Europe. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, told local news reporters that the truck was registered there in 2017, immediately left the country and has not returned since.\n\nEssex police so far believe that the truck traveled from a Belgian port city, Zeebrugge, to Purfleet, a small Essex town. Its transport docked a little after 12:30 a.m. The truck then left Purfleet at about 1:05 a.m. Thirty-five minutes later police said they received a call from local ambulances that bodies had been found in the container.\n\nAuthorities believe the truck took this route to bypass more stringent security at other crossing points into England, where sensors and other tracking measures would have been alerted to the human cargo.\n\nThe chief executive of Zeebrugge port, Joachim Coens, told local Belgian media that refrigerated containers in the port are kept completely sealed during inspection, the Guardian reported.\n\nConditions inside the truck\n\nRod McKenzie, managing director of policy and public affairs at the Road Haulage Association, a U.K. trade group, told The Post that conditions in the truck must have been \u201chellish.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt would be completely dark, probably completely airless, no sanitary facilities, possibly freezing temperatures, with the likelihood of death from freezing or suffocation enormous,\u201d McKenzie said.\n\nNonetheless, human trafficking and modern-day enslavement are on the rise, according to British authorities. As The Post previously reported, \u201cNational Crime Agency figures show that nearly 7,000 possible victims were reported last year \u2014 a 36 percent increase from 2017. Those people came from 130 countries, with Albanians and Vietnamese the most common foreign nationalities.\u201d\n\nThe questions that remain\n\nPolice still have much they don\u2019t know. How did the smugglers and victims connect? What human trafficking networks or other criminal gangs were the smugglers involved in? What were the last hours of the victims\u2019 lives like?\n\nIt also remains unclear who alerted the local ambulance about the truck\u2019s whereabouts and what the driver knew about the contents of the container.\n\nAnother issue investigators will face: identifying the victims, as smugglers typically take away passports and other identification to hide the identities of their passengers before giving them new documents once they have reached their destination.\n\nAD", "description": "Police have arrested four people in connection with the deaths as the investigation continues.
