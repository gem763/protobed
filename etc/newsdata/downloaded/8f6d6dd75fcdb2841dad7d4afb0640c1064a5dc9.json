He was also due to visit a hospital to see the work of a project spearheaded by the first lady, Ana Dias Lourenco.\n\nThe project focuses on preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS from mothers to their babies in a country where high fertility, a young population and lack of awareness are driving infection rates up.\n\nOn Sunday the prince will move on to Malawi, where he will visit projects, supported by UK aid and investment funds, centred on young women and girls\u2019 education. He will also meet President Peter Mutharika and visit a national park before rejoining Meghan and Archie in South Africa.", "description": "Meghan, the wife of Prince Harry, has tied a ribbon at the site in Cape Town where a student was murdered last month, in a gesture of solidarity with those who have taken a stand against gender-based violence.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434894903&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0GA", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
