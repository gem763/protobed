Those fears are real and it happens in many other stories. But fear for our lives, I think, was a bit more minimal in that story.\"\n\nWhile scammers still operate in Ghana, Anas believes that a country's willingness to hold fraudsters accountable is what matters most.\n\n\"Gold scammers will always be there. But the bigger question is how prepared is your nation to fight these. In most African countries we have willing police service who are; if you take the evidence to them, they will want to take those steps. So yes, it is horrible, we have scammers all around. But what is clear in this film is that there are people who are also willing to take down these scammers,\" he says.\n\nThe court cases against those he helped arrest are still pending, but he says \"they are likely to be jailed\".\n\nHe has faith in the justice system, explaining that people he exposed in the past now sit in jail, and that the courts work - even if they take some time.\n\n\"I do know that sometimes the system grinds slowly but I've seen results. And I don't have to get frustrated by that,\" he says.\n\n\"I think it should instil in me a sense of wanting to push the frontiers forever. And I think that people are beginning to see the realities, the hardcore evidence is there. And when you attempt, no matter how slow, it gets done.\"\n\nSource: Al Jazeera", "description": "We go undercover in Ghana to expose gold scammers tricking foreign investors out of huge sums of money.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/27/fa845d29407242f381b4074966f6f02b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
