It could have climbed to sixth with a win on Saturday.\n\nWatford remains in 20th as it bids to extend its five-year stay in the league. The Hornets have five draws, including all of their last three fixtures.\n\nWatford also took off Tom Cleverley after just 10 minutes when the midfielder was injured.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bournemouth drew 0-0 with bottom-placed English Premier League club Watford on Saturday, continuing its decline after strong early season form.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/26/britain_soccer_premier_league_39724_c0-129-3500-2170_s1200x700.jpg?cd686b8304a939d7912fcefd460aac818fd15a91", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
