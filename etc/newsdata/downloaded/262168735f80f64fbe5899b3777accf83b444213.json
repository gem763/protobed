For me, they brought up all those memories of having to explain throughout my life why I, a boy, did ballet.\n\nOver the years it became a lot easier to answer that question and most of the time now when people I meet ask me, with the same puzzlement, how I came to become a choreographer, they will be satisfied with the answer: \u201cI began to dance and then went to ballet school because I loved it.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Last year I made a ballet called \u201cEmbrace\u201d in which for the first time I challenged myself to address these experiences directly in my work.\n\nGrowing up, I heard many comments like the one Spencer made, implying that boys who did ballet are less male \u2013 and that this is a bad thing. They not only made me defend ballet\u2019s \u201cmanliness\u201d but also inadvertently made me feel the need to apologise for being gay.\n\nThe fact that I was actually a gay kid trying not to feel lesser made the struggle to shrug off comments like these that much harder. Loving ballet was one more reason to feel that who I was was wrong, that the things I cared about and the things that made me feel free and alive actually meant I was worthy of ridicule.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Lady Gaga - \u201cBorn This Way\u201d (2011) Lady Gaga\u2019s love of the LGBT community, and her status as \"Mother Monster\" for all outcasts, was brilliantly channelled into this mainstream dance hit.

Joe Biden once said the show \u201cprobably did more to educate the American public\u201d on gay issues than anything else. Powerful stuff. Rex Features\n\nWhenever these sort of controversies arise there is always a noble chorus of voices defending the fact that ballet is indeed \u201cmasculine\u201d, that male dancers are strong, jump high, embody the very athleticism and courage we praise in athletics and other sports.\n\nThe dance community united in a beautiful way to reject the prejudice inferred by the comments made, but the way in which so many chose to voice their concern perhaps belies a deeper prejudice.\n\nIt is certainly true that ballet can make men look strong and commanding and thus portray traditionally \u201cmasculine\u201d traits, but it can also allow men to be soft, fluid, romantic and free. In other words, it shows men to be generally more human than some may want us to accept.\n\nBallet, like almost everything, is itself firmly rooted in a heteronormative tradition. In part because of the physical differences between the male and female body, classical dance often reflects a traditional understanding of the relationship between men and women. While it is absolutely right to fight back against the sort of homophobia that colours comments like Spencer\u2019s, it is important not to allow that reaction to itself propagate the sort of gender stereotypes that cause so much harm to boys and girls alike.\n\nIt is not enough to constantly defend that ballet dancers are as \u201cmanly\u201d as anyone else. This argument misses a far more pressing point. We should all be aware of how we perceive one another based on outdated, unhelpful and very harmful ideals around gender.\n\nSpencer\u2019s comments highlight the pervasive menace of a deep misogyny that infects every section of our society. As a gay man, I am sensitive to the overlap with homophobia, how jokes about boys doing ballet or \u201cthrowing like girls\u201d land with all the more pain when you know they also mean to ridicule you for being queer.\n\nSpencer and those giggling beside her were suggesting ballet is just for girls and no boy would ever enjoy doing something that would make them look like a girl.\n\nOn the playground people used the word \u201cgay\" when someone did something they saw as feminine. That insult, though deeply harmful and distressing to children struggling to come to terms with their sexuality, is not about who we love.\n\nIt\u2019s really about whether we exhibit behaviours that are weak, laughable, silly\u2026 \u201cfemale\u201d. Boys who love ballet, or any other activities that we have learned to associated with women, are ripe for ridicule. The fact that they turn out to be straight or gay is beside the point. The humiliation is being compared to a girl. What could be worse? Boys, girls, all of us are taught the simple truth that to be a girl is to be inferior. The fact that straight men dance, that dancers are athletes, is not really the point.\n\nInstead of trying to persuade people that ballet dancers are strong, powerful and masculine, assuming that this makes the art form seem less inferior or frivolous, let\u2019s highlight ballet\u2019s ability to celebrate all it is to be human.\n\nBallet isn\u2019t about being \u201cfeminine\u201d or \u201cmasculine\u201d, whatever these words now mean. It isn\u2019t about being gay or straight. It is about all these things and more. It is, in fact, about reflecting the world around us in all its complexity and beauty.\n\nWe must all realise that shaming a man, or indeed a six-year-old boy, for doing something that girls or women like to do as well shows just how big a problem we face in challenging misogyny and other related forms of prejudice.\n\nThose boys, princes or not, who refuse to be cowered by people ridiculing them for dancing, for being \u201cgirls\u201d or \u201cgay\u201d or any other embodiment of \u201cother\u201d, are paving the way for everyone coming after them to not only change the face of ballet but, like all art, change the society it\u2019s built for.\n\nGeorge Williamson is a British choreographer working in classical and contemporary ballet", "description": "Last week\u2019s comments by ABC\u2019s Lara Spencer mocking Prince George for enjoying ballet class rightly provoked a great deal of outrage.
