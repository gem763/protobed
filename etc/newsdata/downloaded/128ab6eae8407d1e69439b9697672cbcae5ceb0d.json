But that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with The Last of Us Part II, which will no longer be released in February 21 but now on May 29.\n\n\u201cIt was during the last few weeks, as we were closing out sections of the game, that we realized we simply didn\u2019t have enough time to bring the entire game up to a level of polish we would call Naughty Dog quality,\u201d said director Neil Druckmann in a blog post announcing the delay this morning. \u201cAt this point we were faced with two options: compromise parts of the game or get more time. We went with the latter, and this new release date allows us to finish everything to our level of satisfaction while also reducing stress on the team.\u201d\n\nThe Last of Us Part II was also not the only game delayed today, weirdly.\n\nAs part of their earnings call, Ubisoft revealed Watch Dogs: Legion, previously scheduled for March, would move to their next fiscal year, between April 2020 and March 2021. Gods & Monsters, Ubisoft\u2019s riff on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, was also delayed from February into an ambiguous, to-be-determined slot. And Rainbow Six: Quarantine, a spin-off of the company\u2019s popular multiplayer shooter, will also be released within that long window.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Kotaku reporter Jason Schreier, the delay of Naughty Dog\u2019s The Last of Us Part II will impact the release of another high-profile PlayStation exclusive, the reclusive Ghosts of Tsushima from Sucker Punch. It\u2019ll still be released in 2020, according to Scherier, but will arrive \u201clater in 2020,\u201d to avoid bumping up against The Last of Us Part II.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter.
