Did Trump conceal the true nature of his phone call??? Did Zelensky also aid in the cover-up by repeatedly claiming he never felt pressured by Trump????\n\nBombshell time, amirite?\n\nExcept, no.\n\nAll Vindman could come up with, all Adam Schiff\u2019s star impeachment witness could do, was complain about petty and meaningless things the transcript might have missed, and because that was the best Vindman could come up with \u2014 a guy who hates Trump and who heard the original call \u2014 we now know the transcript of the call released by the White House correctly informed the public of what was said\u2026\n\nWhich means Trump did nothing impeachable.\n\nWhich means Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment jihad continues to get dumber by the day.\n\nAccording to far-left CNN, and the leaks from Schiff\u2019s Star Chamber, Vindman said \u201che would have edited the transcript to specifically show that Zelensky mentioned Burisma \u2014 the company that hired Hunter Biden \u2014 rather than just \u2018the company,\u2019 according to sources.\u201d\n\nNot that it matters, but let\u2019s just go ahead and highlight the fact it was Zelensky who mentioned Burisma, the Ukraine energy company that hired Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter for $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 even though Hunter knows nothing about Ukraine or energy.\n\nThe original transcript reads, \u201cHe or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.\u201d\n\nWe all knew which company he was talking about.\n\nCNN continued, saying. \u201cVindman testified that one example of his attempts to change the transcript was to include Trump telling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky there were tapes of Biden[.]\u201d\n\nSo?\n\nAnyone with a half a brain knows Trump was probably referring to the video we have of Biden bragging about his quid pro quo, about his successful extortion using U.S. military aid to force Ukraine to fire the prosecutor looking into the aforementioned Burisma.\n\nActually, the only troubling news in Vindman\u2019s testimony \u2014 at least the testimony leaked by Schiff \u2014 is that we learned Vindman has a twin brother who works in the National Security Council\u2019s ethics office.\n\nGreat, there\u2019s two of them.\n\nOkay, okay, I don\u2019t want to criticize Vindman too much, not now that the fake news media have labeled him a precious. You see, we\u2019re not supposed to question the loyalty of people who put on the uniform \u2014 unless of course their names are Oliver North, Michael Flynn, Tulsi Gabbard, or John McCain (at least, when McCain is out to rob Barry of his presidency).\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way about Vindman\u2019s \u201cnew details.\u201d So does a potentially important juror in this stupid impeachment.\n\n\u201cI appreciate [Vindman\u2019s] service but I\u2019ve read the transcript and if you add his corrections in it doesn\u2019t change anything for me,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said Wednesday. His additional notes \u201cdon\u2019t change the substance at all.\u201d\n\nNope.\n\nWhich means this impeachment is a total scam.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
