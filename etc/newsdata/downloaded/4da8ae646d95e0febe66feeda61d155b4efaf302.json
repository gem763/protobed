REUTERS/Simon Dawson/Files\n\nCompanies listed on the STOXX 600 regional index are now expected to report a drop of as much as 3.7% in third-quarter earnings, worse than the 3% fall expected a week ago, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv showed.\n\nEarnings that grew by 14.4% in the same quarter a year earlier are seen posting their worst EPS since Q3 2016 when earnings fell 5%.\n\nConsensus for revenue improved slightly with forecasts for flat growth, compared with a fall of 0.3% seen last week. Revenue rose 5.9% a year ago and grew by 3.3% in Q2.\n\nExcluding the energy sector, Q3 earnings are expected to fall just 0.3% with revenue increasing 3.1%, the data showed.\n\nAs the global economy falters, investors have braced for a tough earnings season, which kicks off in earnest next week and will test the stock market\u2019s stellar rally this year.\n\nThe pan European STOXX 600 index is up 16.6% this year.\n\nCompanies in the region have been in an earnings recession since the second quarter when earnings fell 2.1%, posting their second straight quarterly fall. About 80 companies are due to report next week.\n\nQ4 forecasts were reined in, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv showed, with EPS expected to grow 9.1%, down from 9.6% last week, and revenue seen growing by 3.2%, down from 3.4% last week.\n\n(Graphic: Europe vs U.S. earnings here)", "description": "Europe's corporate recession is expected to deepen, the latest forecasts show, as companies struggle with uncertainties from Brexit, the protracted U.S.-China trade spat and Germany's manufacturing recession.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441384425&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0BS", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
