Sen. John McCain, actress Hayden Panettiere, and French intellectual Bernard Henri-Levy roused massive crowds with paeans to freedom and national sovereignty, while offering moral support to the opposition forces led by former boxing champion Vitaly Klitschko.\n\nBut Hagberg, a square-jawed and baby-faced member of the Swedish armed forces, had a darker message.", "description": "A stream of European jihadists have traveled to Syria to wage holy war.
