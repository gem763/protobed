However, Balearia did not do that,\u201d Mr Silva said. \u201cWe asked them to co-ordinate ahead of time. They did not that do that.\u201d\n\nMr Trump claimed that parts of the US were themselves still recovering from the effects of the storm, though he admitted they were not as bad as had been anticipated.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Asked if he planned to discuss it with Mr Trump or other White House officials, he said: \u201cI think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the history shows that it\u2019s taken a lengthy time to get the Bahamas back to where these people can return to, I\u2019m sure that that will be a discussion that we\u2019d be having,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his comments to reporters, Mr Trump also claimed parts of the US were also recovering and that \u201clarge sections of the Bahamas were not hit.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Donald Trump has claimed \u2013 without evidence \u2013 the Bahamas is full of \u201cvery bad gang members\u201d, as he defended a decision not to let survivors of Hurricane Dorian enter the US.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/15/trump-bahamasbadpeople.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
