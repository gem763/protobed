USA TODAY\n\nClimate change will cause El Ni\u00f1os to be stronger, a new study suggests.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1os, which occur every few years, are a natural warming of sea water in the tropical Pacific Ocean that fuel weather extremes in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nLooking back at dozens of El Ni\u00f1os in the past century, scientists found that they have been forming farther to the west since the 1970s. Water is naturally warmer in the western Pacific Ocean, which translates to stronger El Ni\u00f1os.\n\nAnd in the future, continued warming over the western Pacific due to climate change promises conditions that will trigger more extreme El Ni\u00f1o events in the future, according to study lead author Bin Wang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Hawaii.\n\nThis is important because past El Ni\u00f1os \u2014 especially strong ones \u2014 have wreaked weather havoc around the world.\n\nFor example, globally, the 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o caused thousands of deaths from severe storms, heat waves, floods and drought, costing between $32 billion and $96 billion, according to a United Nations study.\n\nMore on this topic: What is an El Ni\u00f1o, and what effects will this climate pattern have on spring weather?\n\nMarilyn Lane attempts to close her doors to prevent a large wave from crashing into the living room of her home near Ventura, Calif., in this Jan. 30, 1998, file photo.

During each of those El Ni\u00f1os, the world also broke new average temperature records.\n\nThe study adds to growing evidence that \u201cEl Nino events are becoming stronger under continued climate change,\u201d said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb, who wasn\u2019t part of the research.\n\nThe study was published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nConsider this: Ozone hole shrinks to smallest size on record, and it's not related to global warming\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/22/climate-change-trigger-more-extreme-el-nino-weather-events/4057622002/", "description": "El Ni\u00f1os are\u00a0a natural warming of sea water in the tropical Pacific Ocean that fuel weather extremes\u00a0in the U.S. and around the world.", "authors": ["Doyle Rice", "Published A.M.
