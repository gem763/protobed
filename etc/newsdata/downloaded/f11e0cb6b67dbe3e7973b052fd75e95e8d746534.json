Yesterday, it closed at $51.43 for a total loss of 40.4% in nine months. Nine months in which the general stock market has been rallying.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is a pharmacy retailer with over 18 500 stores in 11 countries. Walgreens is considered a \u201cdefensive\u201d company, because people get sick and need medicine regardless of the economic conditions. Well, losing 40% of the investment in less than a year is not exactly our idea of \u201cdefensive\u201d.\n\nHowever, Walgreens\u2019 business remains solid and at some point the stock is going to stop falling and head north again. Is WBA ready to start recovering? Let\u2019s see if Elliott Wave analysis can help us find out.\n\nWalgreens Stock 4 Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart of Walgreens stock reveals that the decline from over $86 to $49 is impulsive. According to the theory, a three-wave correction in the other direction follows every impulse.\n\nIf this count is correct, WBA stock is already searching for a bottom. We can expect a notable recovery to roughly $65 a share for a total gain of nearly 30%. The MACD indicator also supports the positive outlook. It shows a strong bullish divergence between waves 1, 3 and 5.\n\nNo trend lasts forever and Walgreens\u2019 downtrend is not going to either.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by EWM Interactive  covering: Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.
