During the trial, Clark and Lucas testified against Cromartie.\n\nBoth men pleaded guilty to lesser charges, court papers showed.\n\nCromartie has filed unsuccessful appeals with state and federal courts on several grounds since his conviction.\n\nThe State Board of Pardons and Paroles in Georgia refused to stay his case and denied Cromartie clemency on Tuesday.\n\nCromartie requested the board to intervene so federal courts could rule on his request that DNA testing be done on evidence in his criminal case.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court rejected Cromartie's request for an appeal in his case in December 2018.\n\nCromartie would have been the 18th inmate in the United States and the third inmate in Georgia to be executed in 2019, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.", "description": "Ray Cromartie was due to be executed tonight in Georgia, US, for killing a shopkeeper", "authors": ["Brendan O'Brien", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Georgia Department Of Corrections", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20742852.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_eb7c08d2193396dc7750e6b3d15a61f3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
