A starlet of stage and Strictly like Kara Tointon. And a highly-rated director such as Sean Foley, who has previously staged Ealing comedies and who worked with Mangan on a hit production of Jeeves and Wooster in 2013.\n\nYou might also consider employing a designer such as Michael Taylor. His lavishly varied set here matches the 1951 film scene-for-scene in Lancashire locations down the pub, up the mill or on the open road.\n\nAnd to paper over any cracks that may appear in the translation from screen to stage, why not commission some skiffle music from Charlie Fink of the band Noah & The Whale?\n\nA comic actor like Stephen Mangan. A starlet of stage and Strictly like Kara Tointon. And a highly-rated director such as Sean Foley, who has previously staged Ealing comedies and who worked with Mangan on a hit production of Jeeves and Wooster in 2013\n\nYou would, I think, be fairly confident of having a hit on your hands. But impressive as this line-up is, I soon found myself wondering why I was liking their production more than loving it. Perhaps because the story is so last century.\n\nTrying to perfect the formula for an indestructible fabric, boffin Sidney (Mangan) is discovered repeatedly wrecking the lab of a Lancashire textile manufacturer (a magnificently brusque Richard Cordery).\n\nOnly the boss\u2019s fabulously stylish daughter (Tointon) understands Sidney\u2019s geekish mission and is prepared to help him. No one stages such capers better than Foley. He has our hero blowing up his lab coat, flying from the back of his beloved\u2019s shiny red Daimler and removing a misplaced prawn from the crotch of Tointon\u2019s fiance.\n\nIt\u2019s high farce, with doors banging, scenery unfolding and an amusing chase at the end through the pop-up houses of a giant Lowry-style landscape. Comedy, however, needs to move at the speed of thought, and with so much going on, even Fink\u2019s toe-tapping rockabilly music struggles to hide sluggish segues.\n\nEven so, Mangan\u2019s bashful Sidney is immaculately drilled as he shows us effortless timing, goofy teeth and disorderly hair. He\u2019ll be fitter than a butcher\u2019s dog by the end of the run, not least thanks to his dance medley with Tointon in her boudoir \u2014 a necessary nod to Strictly.\n\nAs the mill owner\u2019s daughter she is a likeable, but very bizarre, comic cross between Maggie Thatcher and Corrie\u2019s late Vera Duckworth. No wonder Sidney finds her terrifying.\n\nSue Johnston is absolutely herself as Sidney\u2019s washerwoman landlady, but Rina Fatania as factory worker Brenda is the show\u2019s most naturally funny flat-cap creation.\n\nNo one puts a foot wrong, yet sporadic laughter is more appreciative than festive. When a comedy has to work this hard, it\u2019s often because it\u2019s not working at all. Be warned: pedigree is no substitute for chemistry.\n\nIn Watford, new life has been breathed into Patrick Hamilton\u2019s ghoulish Victorian melodrama, written in 1938.\n\nIt ain\u2019t subtle, but Richard Beecham directs a sharply focused production in a crisis-centre fitted with Exit signs, health-and-safety notices and dimmer switches to simulate the eerie gaslight\n\nThe play gave us the term \u2018gaslighting\u2019 with its story of a woman being driven mad by her manipulative husband. Here it\u2019s re-set in a modern women\u2019s refuge where the play is acted out by the residents. It creates a new perspective on psychological abuse.\n\nThe actress Jasmine Jones gives a manspreading demonstration of \u2018toxic masculinity\u2019 as the original play\u2019s anti-hero Jack, rendering him as a nasty, snarling Ulsterman in the body of an evil sparrow.\n\nSally Tatum plays Jack\u2019s wife with a mix of fearful defiance and desperate hysteria, before Tricia Kelly comes to the rescue as a thoroughly maternal Inspector Rough.\n\nIt ain\u2019t subtle, but Richard Beecham directs a sharply focused production in a crisis-centre fitted with Exit signs, health-and-safety notices and dimmer switches to simulate the eerie gaslight.\n\nThere\u2019s a touch of sarcasm with Tammy Wynette\u2019s Stand By Your Man, and the rather too tidy ending could do with a modern twist. Otherwise, a fusty old yarn has been given an electric shock.\n\nA quirky Austen in need of a maestro, by MELANIE MCDONAGH\n\nThe Watsons (Menier Chocolate Factory)\n\nVerdict: Fleabag meets Jane Austen\n\nRating:\n\nWe can't leave well alone when it comes to Jane Austen \u2014 yes, I\u2019m thinking Sanditon. It was only a matter of time before someone finished off one of her abandoned novels, The Watsons. Laura Wade has made it into a play.\n\nAs it was left by the author, the whole thing is pleasurably reminiscent of Pride And Prejudice.\n\nWade does give us an actual dramatisation of the remnant we\u2019re left with, which I found rather captivating: heroine with a crush on the dishy cleric; the inarticulate lord with a crush on the heroine; the snobbish mother out to spoil the fun; and a Wickham-style bounder in the wings.\n\nWe can't leave well alone when it comes to Jane Austen \u2014 yes, I\u2019m thinking Sanditon. It was only a matter of time before someone finished off one of her abandoned novels, The Watsons. Laura Wade has made it into a play\n\nIt might have been rather good if Wade had just channelled Jane Austen with this terrific cast, not least Grace Molony as a divinely pretty Emma Watson (not that one) and Jane Booker as Lord Osborne\u2019s imperious mum.\n\nBut The Watsons becomes a vehicle for Wade\u2019s play on the concept of authorship. As soon as the plot runs out and Wade tries to take over, \u2018Laura\u2019 comes on stage to confront the heroine, Emma, to explain that she is, you know, a character. The entire cast then confronts the author before rebelling to make their own destinies.\n\nFreed from 19th-century conventions they become \u2014 surprise! \u2014 just like liberated us.\n\nSo Lady Osborne finds she is in love with Nanny, the Watsons\u2019 buxom housekeeper (Sally Bankes). Emma Watson beds a soldier. Miss Osborne (Cat White) decides she herself wants to be a soldier.\n\nAnd playwright Laura (Louise Ford) seems to mirror Phoebe Waller-Bridge because she is as near as damn it to Fleabag. Yes, it\u2019s very clever. Yes, the audience loved it. No, I didn\u2019t.\n\nNo kidding! Child's play is close to comic perfection, by LUKE JONES\n\nGroan Ups (Vaudeville Theatre, London)\n\nVerdict: Striking farce\n\nRating:\n\nThis critic is a child of the Nineties, so every sly gag at the expense of MSN messenger, Ronan Keating and WKD Blue had me howling.\n\nI wasn\u2019t alone. It\u2019s an almighty comfort to hear an auditorium of all ages nearly choke themselves to death laughing.\n\nThe flawless comedy troupe Mischief Theatre stormed Edinburgh, the West End, the UK and Broadway with The Play That Goes Wrong, branched out into Peter Pan, Christmas and a bank heist, and even ended up on TV.\n\nThey offer high-octane sitcom energy, sharp scripts and gently smutty humour. This time, their focus is school and growing up. We follow five \u2018children\u2019 up and out of the classes; from very young and frantic, to mid-30s and despondent.\n\nThey offer high-octane sitcom energy, sharp scripts and gently smutty humour. This time, their focus is school and growing up. We follow five \u2018children\u2019 up and out of the classes; from very young and frantic, to mid-30s and despondent\n\nHenry Lewis, Jonathan Sayer and Henry Shields write and star. It\u2019s madly funny and there is an outrageous farce sequence towards the end (doors are slammed, affairs are revealed, hamsters are \u2018killed\u2019), but the most delicious treat is seeing this band of grown men and women play a class of five-year-olds, standing next to 6ft chairs, flouncing around and descending into indignant screams.\n\nIt\u2019s a great mix of cheap and dirty, with smart execution. A child misunderstanding what she heard coming from her parents\u2019 bedroom as they argue over the mop (\u2018give it to me, give it to me, so dirty\u2019) nearly winded me.\n\nThe whole lot of them are near comedy perfection, but Nancy Zamit stands out in particular.\n\nHaving said all that, it\u2019s far too long. We\u2019re trained early, by Groan Ups, into expecting barely five seconds going by without another gag, trip, slam or breaking of wind. So when it slows for a while in the middle, and fumbles after a bit of emotional heft at the end, it\u2019s quite deflating.\n\nI didn\u2019t really buy the marriage breakdown or the \u2018coming out\u2019 that it twists into, but I was still left with a feast of jokes.", "description": "PATRICK MARMION: Should you ever wish to exhume an Ealing comedy for the stage, you might be tempted to assemble a team such as this.", "authors": ["Patrick Marmion For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/02/19565968-0-image-a-29_1570755908462.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
