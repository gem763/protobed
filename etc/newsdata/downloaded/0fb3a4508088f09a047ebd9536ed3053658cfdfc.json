They have proven a lot by being promoted and I've actually played under both managers and I know how they think, I know how they go about doing business.\n\nHarris recently left Millwall and Edwards thinks he would bring a lot to the table\n\nIan Holloway is currently out of a job and could also be interested in the position\n\n'It may not always be the right way but you live by those decisions and I would like to see any one of them getting the job.'\n\nSpeaking at a Goals Worth Talking About exhibition for World Mental Health Day, Edwards said he felt the decision to sack Ross was rushed.\n\n'I think it was a bit harsh to sack the manager this early,' he added.\n\n'A lot of pressure was on him, that's fair enough, they didn't get promoted last season, but saying that I think it was a bit of a rushed decision to get rid of him.\n\n'I'm hoping that comes the next time round, that whoever is in the line to get the job can get them promoted or at least give him time to progress.'\n\nHe added: 'I know for a fact he (Ross) did try and it's only going to be a matter of time. Whoever comes in, I do hope that they give him a lot of time.'", "description": "Former Sunderland defender Carlos Edwards has backed Neil Harris or Ian Holloway to land the vacant managerial role at the Stadium of Light.", "authors": ["Sonia Twigg", "Press Association Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/23/19561900-0-image-a-91_1570746019079.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
