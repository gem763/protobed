It is possibly also the most controversial of the lot.\n\nEver since the U.S. shale oil boom took off in 2014, before slumping spectacularly in 2016 as the crude price crash led to the bankruptcies of dozens of oil drillers, the weekly production published by the EIA has time and again been a source of dispute\u2014particularly with oil bulls, who feel the number is overinflated and lacks realistic correlation to drilling activity.\n\nIt must be stressed that this crude output number cited by the EIA each week is an estimate; nothing more, nothing less.\n\nSchaefer of Oil & Gas Investments noted that it is \u201ca fully-modeled estimate; which is a fancy way of saying it actually contains no new data from the previous week.\u201d\n\nYet, it\u2019s a number published by the custodian of the world\u2019s most transparent and researched data on oil production and storage. And there is no other competing or authoritative data of its kind. Therefore, the market accepts it as the truth.\n\nThat isn\u2019t a bad thing, only that the EIA production number now is flying in the face of another highly respected weekly report on drilling rigs issued by Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company with a sterling reputation as well.\n\nEIA\u2019s Record High Production Estimate Jars With Baker Hughes\u2019 Sliding Rig Count\n\nfrom last Friday shows there are just 696 actively-drilling oil rigs now, the lowest since April 2017. The EIA\u2019s estimated production, meanwhile, stands at a record high 12.6 million barrels per day\u2014unchanged for three weeks now.\n\nBased on Baker Hughes\u2019 historical rig count rates, there are 56.7% fewer drilling rigs now since October 2014. But these rigs are producing an additional 3,725,000 barrels per day of oil\u2014or 42% more\u2014than they did five years ago.\n\nIf the EIA and Baker Hughes are both right, then the efficiency for oil drilling in the U.S. has jumped by more than three-fold in just five years, with 18,103 bpd coming out of one rig now versus 5,515.85 bpd in October 2014. Some analysts have trouble believing that.\n\nPhil Flynn of the Price Futures Group in Chicago, who typically holds a bullish bias towards oil, is aghast that the EIA\u2019s crude production estimate has been stuck at a record 12.6 million bpd for three weeks in a row, when shale production activity as a whole has been plummeting.\n\nSaid Flynn:\n\n\u201cWe think that production will have to be adjusted downward. Lower rig counts and shale bankruptcies are taking their toll as many shale producers are figuring out that if you are losing money on every barrel, you can not make up for it in volume.\u201d\n\nIf the weekly production published by the EIA is in dispute, what\u2019s the next most authoritative number/source the market can turn to?\n\nThe answer, as you have it, is the Petroleum Supply Monthly report which, ironically, is also from the EIA.\n\nSchaefer of Oil & Gas Investments once again answered why this is so:\n\n\u201cThe monthly data has real data, and \u2026 is incredibly accurate. You can take those monthly numbers to the bank almost every month.\u201d\n\nIt All Adds Up, Whether You Believe It Or Not\n\nSchaefer conceded that over time, the EIA may overestimate, or even underestimate, weekly production given market dynamics. But the agency usually smoothes out the difference as each month concludes.\n\nTo make his point, Schaefer averaged out daily production from the monthly data published by the EIA across 2017.\n\nThe conclusion? He arrived at numbers that closely aligned with the weekly output estimated by the EIA.\n\nWe did the math at Investing.com too, just to be sure, taking the most recently available monthly production number\u2014July\u2019s 365,992,000 barrels\u2014and dividing it over 30 days. The rounded-up answer was 12.2 million bpd.\n\nThe EIA\u2019s weekly production estimate at end-July?\n\nAlso 12.2 million bpd.\n\nWe rest our case.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: Crude Oil WTI Futures.
