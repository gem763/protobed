We've had real big wars in the last 100 years, real geopolitical turmoil. We're not in that phase right now... it's not that bad right now.\"\n\nJosh Frydenberg (right) with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid.\n\nIn his interview, Mr Frydenberg pushed back at the gloomy interpretation some took in Australia to last week's IMF downgrade to GDP growth and reiterated that structural reform was the key to driving longer-term economic growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis remarks came a day after the IMF endorsed Australia's current mix of interest rate cuts, fiscal stimulus through income tax cuts and even its \"steady progress\" on infrastructure \u2013 effectively damping calls from some circles for more immediate stimulus spending.\n\nHowever, the IMF still cast a shadow over the Morrison government's approach, saying that while it backed Mr Frydenberg's budget for 2019-20, next year's document would present a more difficult choice.\n\nJosh Frydenberg (left) with the German Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann.\n\n\"We see that the current year's budget with the personal income tax cuts that it contains is providing welcome fiscal support,\" said Jonathan Ostry, the IMF's top analyst for the Asia-Pacific region in response to a question from the Financial Review at the IMF's annual meeting.\n\n\"It is a tougher call for what next fiscal year's budget should aim for,\" he said.\n\nThe current economic policy mix, driven by Mr Frydenberg and Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe, takes \"the view that there is a balance needed between longer-term debt goals for Australia and the need to provide some support\".\n\n\"We respect the way they have assessed that trade-off,\" said Dr Ostry, deputy director at the IMF's Asia Pacific unit and the fund's former lead analyst for Australia between 1998 and 2000.\n\n\"We would underscore, however, that in the event that there were further downward shocks to growth in the future, that fiscal policy would need to be part of the answer and to provide additional support, mainly on the spending side.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Frydenberg responded to Dr Ostry's remarks, saying; \"Fiscal policy already is front and centre to the government's thinking about economic settings and policy, and that explains the action we're taking\".\n\n\"As for future policy, we continue to monitor global and domestic events. We don't gloss over the real challenges we're facing, including the impact of the drought.\"\n\nHe rejected the common view that the budget question represents a binary choice.\n\n\"It's not an either/or proposition \u2013 strengthening the budget position and ensuring a strong economy with consistent economic growth,\" the Treasurer said.\n\n\"People recognise the limits to monetary policy, but what we\u2019ve tried to do in Australia \u2013 where we\u2019ve got tax cuts and infrastructure making its way through to the economy \u2013 but at the same time we\u2019re making our commitment to pay down debt which gives us more resilience and flexibility in the event of future economic shocks.\n\n\"Certainly the sense I got is that the global economy does face a synchronised slowdown and there\u2019s been a fall in business investment, global trade volumes and manufacturing. Also motor vehicle sales are down.\n\n\"But as we acclimatise to this new paradigm of low interest rates, low unemployment and low inflation, we need to not lose sight of the structural reform agenda, because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive longer-term growth.\u201d\n\nIMF pushes tax reform ... to property\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, Dr Ostry backed Dr Lowe's recent call for a renewed emphasis on structural reform.\n\nDr Ostry said he was \"very much in line\" with Dr Lowe's message to the IMF last week that \"structural reforms are also an appropriate part of the mix to stimulate the economy\".\n\nJosh Frydenberg with the new IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva.\n\nThe IMF economist listed tax reform, \"including levelling the playing field between real estate and other sectors so as to stimulate business investment\", the \"very great potential\" for boosting female labour force participation and gender equity, as well as \"something that is entrained in Australia, the steady progress at closing infrastructure gaps\".\n\nIMF officials at the Washington-based institution last week downgraded Australia's GDP forecasts, in Dr Ostry's words, by \"quite a bit\" to a sub-par 1.7 per cent in 2019 and 2.3 per cent in 2020.\n\nMr Frydenberg said the IMF's forecast for 2020 was still faster than all other G7 economies and above the 1.7 per cent average for advanced economies.\n\nDr Ostry also endorsed the Reserve Bank's three interest rate cuts since June, saying that Australia's macroeconomic policies \"have reacted appropriately, in our view\".\n\n\"There have been a series of policy rate cuts by the Reserve Bank, which are working their way through the system and providing welcome monetary policy stimulus, which under our baseline we believe will help get output back to trend and close the output gap and get inflation back toward the midpoint of the target.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe federal government had also \"provided welcome support\".\n\n\"We see that the current year's budget with the personal income tax cuts that it contains is providing welcome fiscal support.\"\n\nDr Lowe told a forum at the IMF on Friday that Australia's economy was set to return to \"trend growth\" next year, which would cut unemployment and boost wages, and signalled policymakers don't believe they have \"a lot more work to do\" to restore inflation to their 2-3 per cent target range.\n\nHis remarks were widely regarded as hosing down prospects of another interest rate cut next month. After his speech, financial markets priced in just a 16 per cent chance of a quarter-point rate cut in November, down from more than 40 per cent earlier in the week.\n\nMr Frydenberg's visit to Washington, his second as Treasurer, included a debate at an IMF-hosted meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs on digital taxation.\n\nHe said he urged the world's biggest economies to \"make sure that any consensus-based international solution encourages investment and doesn\u2019t have unintended consequences\".\n\n\"A lot of thinking needs to be done not just about where value is created but how value is created, and that involves the contribution of users, consumers, markets, and entrepreneurship,\" he told the Financial Review.\n\nDuring his visit to Washington, Mr Frydenberg also met new IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva, Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann, and OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria.", "description": "Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has left Washington upbeat about challenges facing the global and domestic economies even as the IMF warned Australia must tackle tax reform and possibly tap the surplus to stimulate growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.3638%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_113/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/786bc3f03a43240d003522408da941f9925c503b", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
