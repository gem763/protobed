The move was made after allegations of corruption and sexual harassment against CAF president Ahmad Ahmad, who remains in his post despite an investigation by FIFA\u2019s ethics committee.\n\n\u201cThere are obstacles that we faced that resulted in our request for assistance. That\u2019s why we also need you, the independent experts. Together we will move forward,\u201d Ahmad said in a statement on the CAF website.", "description": "FIFA have formed an independent task force to help reform the scandal-ridden Confederation of African Football having taken over the management of the continental organisation last month.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428681484&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0YJ-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
