There are plenty of retailers, networks and resale apps that will offer you cash or discounts for trading in your old device.\n\nWhether you are looking for an upgrade or have a stack of old phones gathering dust in a drawer, here are the some of the best and easiest ways to sell your old phone.\n\nHow to sell your old phone\n\nDo your research\n\nCheck you are getting the right price for your phone first. Some trade in programmes may not offer the best value and, while you may think that trying to sell the phone yourself might be the best option, if it is damaged it could be difficult to find a willing buyer.\n\nWipe your data\n\nBackup your iPhone then reset it to factory settings before you send it off. You don't want the new owner getting access to your data. You can usually do this in the settings tab on your smartphone.\n\nYou can get great deals on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 Credit: AP More\n\nPackaging and posting\n\nIf you are selling it yourself, you will want to ensure the item gets off in good time and is stored in a safe box with plenty of padding. If you are trading it in with a website, these may offer a free delivery service to send in your phone.\n\nChoose when and where to sell\n\nPicking a good place to sell your phone can get you a much better deal. It can also be a great idea to sell your phone just before or after the launch of the next major handset, when many people will be searching for the new phone. eBay, the auction site, says the day a new iPhone arrives in stores is the best time to sell your older version.\n\nTrade in deals\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get cash or discounts quickly for your old mobile phone is to trade it in. Several phone manufacturers offer incentives to upgrade in your old device.\n\nCarphone Warehouse\n\nCarphone Warehouse is currently offering a series of discounts for those wishing to get cash for their old iPhone models.\n\nCarphone Warehouse will pay \u00a3410 for an iPhone X, \u00a3240 for an iPhone 8 or \u00a3115 for an iPhone 7.\n\nIt will also pay you for trade-ins on plenty of other smartphones, from Samsung to Sony.\n\nTo get cash for your phone:\n\nGo to the trade in website and enter your mobile's details Get the free sales pack Post your device to Carphone Warehouse Receive your payout in three to five working days\n\nApple Store\n\nOn the Apple Store you can trade in for credit on your old iPhone. Its not as much as on Carphone Warehouse, although Apple's upgrade programme, where you pay monthly to upgrade annually to their latest phone, does offer a good discount.\n\nYou can get credit towards new phones, such as the iPhone X Credit: Apple More\n\nStory continues", "description": "Apple is set to unveil its latest products at its annual\u00a0event in Cupertino, California, with its new iPhone 11 (or iPhone XI) set to be one of three smartphones the company is expected to reveal on September 10.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yC81ECMeIL8f6eIspHwJQA--~B/aD00NzM7dz03NTc7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/fb99fb08043ea8f5d79f7d6350b306db", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
