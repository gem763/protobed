It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]\n\nOverall, the stock market continued its improvement throughout 2019, compared to where it ended in 2018; it has been a complete turnaround from last year\u2019s drop when stocks entered bear-market territory.\n\nBut even though many stocks have completely erased all of their losses and made it back into the green, not all stocks have done so well. What this means is that while there are still plenty of duds out there, there are also a few undervalued stocks to buy; it has just become a little trickier to find them amid all the flashy comeback stories.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo find the best stocks to buy now, disciplined investors might start with their own watch list, which should contain \u201cwish list\u201d stocks that are usually too expensive or have been put there to be on the back burner for later.\n\nAmong such stocks, companies that got left out of the rally are the most compelling. Even better, some of the best undervalued stocks to buy are those that dropped by double-digit percentages during the current rally.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nStocks that have already priced in current and possible negative news typically lower the risk for investors. Such companies may work to resolve the business problem at hand, which improves its prospects and leads to a higher share price in the long run. As long as the bad news reported is a temporary setback and the business model is not broken, the risks behind buying a stock on a dip are lower.\n\nWith all of that in mind, here are five undervalued stocks to buy that aren\u2019t as scary as they seem.\n\n\n\n\n\nSony (SNE)\n\n5 Undervalued Stocks to Buy More\n\nInvestors who held Sony (NYSE:SNE) stock through the Q2 2019 earnings report posted on July 30 enjoyed the rally that followed. The stock rose from $54.50 to nearly $60 recently and has been trading in the $58-$59 range ever since.\n\nThe company reported revenue falling just 1.4% year-over-year but operating income rose 18%, up 35.9 billion yen (US $332.2 million), but the Q3 report doesn\u2019t look as bright.\n\nNow that Sony is trading at yearly highs, investors need not sell the stock just yet.\n\nWhen Sony\u2019s Playstation 5 arrives, SNE will have more power than ever. Though the PS5 release will release no sooner than mid-2020, 8K support and game refreshes should give Sony another boost in revenue when the time comes.\n\nSony faced a few headwinds in the quarter. Contributions from first-party software titles fell. Sales of non-first party titles declined. But PS4 hardware sales rose, as did network service sales, including sales of PlayStation Plus.\n\n\n\n\n\nCelestica (CLS)\n\n5 Undervalued Stocks to Buy More\n\nIn July, Celestica (NYSE:CLS) reported respectable Q3/2019 results recently, but it didn\u2019t move the CLS stock out of its $6 trading range.\n\nThe company supplies equipment in ATS aerospace and defense, industrial, smart energy, health tech and capital equipment. Its enterprise unit consists of servers and storage. Why then, should investors believe the company will offset the weakness it faces in the eroding semiconductor market?\n\nCelestica is cutting costs in operations to align the business with the lower revenue. It will continue to build its capital equipment business. Management believes the fundamentals in this space will only improve in the long run. As next-generation adoption in display continues, its OLED business, for example, will add to its bottom line.", "description": "[Editor's note: \"5 Undervalued Stocks to Buy\" was previously published in September 2019.
