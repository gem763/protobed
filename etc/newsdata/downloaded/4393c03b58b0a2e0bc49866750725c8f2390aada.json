Buyers who enter the market, at best perhaps a handful of times in their lives, are invariably hopelessly outgunned by the professional sharks that swim through the opaque rules, fees and conventions of buying and selling. In the US, most deals are hammered out between selling and buyers\u2019 agents.\n\nEveryone takes a piece of the action, preying on vulnerable, emotional customers. There\u2019s so much to loathe about the process. It is a sprawling slab of the economy that is ripe for disruption.\n\nAllon and Reffkin want to turn that story on its head \u2013 to make buying and selling seamless; to chisel away the complexity and barriers between buyers and sellers. The way Allon sees it, there\u2019s more information to guide you on where to go to dinner \u2013 through Yelp and Google Maps \u2013 than there is to guide you on what your house is worth.\n\nCompass\u2019s algorithms, he says, provide fast and accurate estimates. \u201cI think when you back it up with data and you actually help people at scale, that\u2019s how you gain the trust of the users,\u201d he says. The company\u2019s so-called \u201cnorth star\u201d is \u201cto deploy all the technology that we can think of to really help people find their place in the world. That\u2019s a mission that a lot of people like and can relate to\u201d.\n\nAcross America, in the front yards of houses and apartment-block windows, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that the Compass approach is gaining traction. This correspondent has watched Compass-branded sales signs pop up like mushrooms throughout a Maryland suburb next to the District of Columbia border. A little over a year ago, such signs weren\u2019t there.\n\nAllon says the value of transactions Compass completes is set to double this year since 2018 to more than $US80 billion. It completed about 35,000 deals last year and is targeting 20 per cent market share across America\u2019s 20 biggest city markets by 2020. \u201cWe\u2019re moving faster than we anticipated, so I think we\u2019re going to hit this target,\u201d Allon says. In some places, like San Francisco, market share already above that goal.\n\nA funding round for Compass in July raised an extra $US370 million, taking its investors\u2019 total commitment to just over $US1.5 billion and producing an eye-watering valuation of $US6.4 billion as well as raising expectations for an eventual initial public offering.\n\nAll of this has helped boost 39-year-old Allon\u2019s personal wealth, which has leapt almost 40 per cent to $747 million in the past year, according to the Financial Review Young Rich List. Allon\u2019s stake in Compass accounts for about $600 million of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the beginning, his has been a remarkable story \u2013 a fortune built on being the right guy, doing the right thing at the right time, in the right place. And that \u201cright place\u201d happened to be an Australian university.\n\nAllon was born in Israel, his father is a journalist for the liberal Tel Aviv-based Haaretz newspaper, his mother a retired television station executive. While skirting questions about his personal life, it\u2019s clear Allon stays close to his roots. For a telephone interview several weeks after our first one in New York, Allon breaks away from his family\u2019s Rosh Hashanah celebrations while on a visit back to Israel.\n\nHis parents always encouraged him to \u201cgo for big things \u2013 not to settle. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d be where I am today without my parents, on many levels\u201d. As a kid, Allon says he did well at academic pursuits as well as sports like surfing and basketball. At 15, he posted the second-fastest Israeli 100-metre time for his age group, clocking 11.8 seconds. Computers, maths and physics were early passions. \u201cI knew from an early age that I\u2019m going to stay a student for a long time.\u201d\n\nLife in Australia\n\nAfter high school and compulsory military service, he moved to Melbourne in 2002 and completed bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in computer science at Monash University before moving to the University of NSW in Sydney to do a PhD backed by an Australian Research Council grant.\n\nDuring that time he became an Australian citizen \u2013 something he says he pursued \u201cright away\u201d after becoming convinced he would build his future there. \u201cI was like; \u2018oh my god, this place is amazing\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe guy searched for his wife\u2019s name and I got her university, I got her thesis work, I got everything. He was shocked. \u2014 Ori Allon\n\nHis big break came within weeks of starting his PhD at UNSW, as he began the requisite literature review that precedes all doctoral work. Allon spotted what looked like an unexploited gap in his chosen field of internet search.\n\nAt the time, the biggest internet search engines would rank websites according to how many other sites linked to them. The young PhD candidate began thinking about how banks had become adept at mining huge stores of data by \u201cclustering\u201d things like the age or income of customers to sell new products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy do we do it only on numbers and clients,\u201d he wondered. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we apply data mining techniques on the internet, the whole internet?\u201d\n\nBefore he could fully test his idea, Allon needed serious computing firepower. He credits his supervisor Dr Eric Martin and UNSW\u2019s then head of school Professor Paul Compton for securing all the resources he needed, filling his room in the School of Computer Science and Engineering with expensive servers. \u201cThey funded it and they had the foresight,\u201d he says.\n\nOnce armed with the sufficient hardware, he set to work. Rather than typing \"Australia\" into Google and getting a long list of websites that mention that word, his software pulled up pages with more useful information like important cities or historical events. (For an idea of how it works, type your name into a Google search bar and watch it throw up related words.) In September 2005, UNSW announced its PhD student\u2019s keyword-driven idea, now patented as Orion.\n\nAt a press conference in 2016 to announce Amar'e Stoudemire's signing with Allon's Hapoel Jerusalem basketball team.\n\nAnd then Silicon Valley came knocking. Google flew a team, led by a top engineering executive, across the Pacific to see a demonstration. \u201cThe guy searched for his wife\u2019s name and I got her university, I got her thesis work, I got everything. He was shocked,\u201d Allon said.\n\nA bidding war ensued, reportedly between Microsoft, Yahoo and Google, which won after UNSW and Allon accepted what he says was a \u201csignificant, life-changing\u201d sum of money. The figure is subject to a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nMoving to the US\n\nAfter the deal went through in 2006 Allon moved to the US where he led a team of engineers fusing Orion into Google\u2019s brain \u2013 a hugely complex task that took two years to complete. \u201cWe had to touch every system.\u201d\n\nThe day the tech went live in March 2009 \u2013 the same year UNSW awarded his PhD \u2013 was one of Allon\u2019s proudest days. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think when you sit there and you\u2019re like \u2018oh, I have this idea that one day you\u2019re going to turn the switch and it\u2019s part of the most important search company in the world\u2019. If you think about the whole journey, it kind of sounds crazy.\u201d\n\nAllon\u2019s success in the US means he hasn\u2019t been back to Australia in a decade. Yet he remains ever grateful to the universities that launched him. Monash and UNSW gave him an education as good, he says, as American Nobel laureate factories like MIT or Stanford.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can say that because I hire a lot of those guys and I know the kind of education I got ... I\u2019m a product of Australian colleges and universities. The fact is, the most important work that I\u2019ve ever done was in Australia.\u201d\n\nWhich throws up a perennial question: why couldn\u2019t the tech be commercialised here? While Telstra at one point looked at the technology, says Allon, Orion ultimately landed in the US because of the scale and depth of its tech industry.\n\n\u201cPeople here are ready to adapt and to use new technologies and they have the means to pay for them. In other places it\u2019s just harder and slower.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Australia. I obviously became a citizen \u2026 but in terms of the opportunities in today\u2019s world, I think America \u2026 is very hard to compete with.\u201d\n\nBuilding a legacy\n\nEither way, the move to Google instilled in him a drive to succeed. A Mountain View engineer gave him early advice, saying it was all good and well to come up with \u201ca clever business and then sell it to a big company\u201d but ultimately the goal should be to build something with a legacy. Allon has been chasing that idea ever since.\n\nHe left Google in 2010, moved to New York and created another start-up, which he called Julpan, an Indigenous Australian word for Orion: \u201cI stayed true to my Australian roots.\u201d\n\nAfter the success of Orion, Allon was able to pull in Microsoft as an early investor. The company\u2019s 20-strong team built another search engine, this time focused on analysing social media and helping users find relevant content.\n\nJust as Julpan was just about to launch its technology, Allon says the phone rang with an invitation to meet Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and its then CEO, Dick Costolo. Allon says he was torn between building an enduring company or selling yet again.\n\nBut having \u201csomeone offer you tens of millions of dollars\u201d after one year of work was hard to dismiss. Not just for him, but for his co-investors and staff. \u201cA lot of them are my friends and that\u2019s life-changing for them as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter bought Julpan in September 2011 for an undisclosed sum, although it was reported to be its largest-ever acquisition, eclipsing the $US40 million it outlaid for TweetDeck four months earlier. Julpan\u2019s tech is used to this day, helping users search for related tweets.\n\nThe trappings of wealth\n\nHaving scored two huge slam-dunks in a row, Allon began to enjoy some of the perks of great wealth.\n\nHis money has gone into a nightclub in Manhattan\u2019s Little Italy called Goldbar, which has walls embedded with gold skulls. Nearby is another investment, Sweetwater Social, a sports bar off Broadway where Allon likes to watch games.\n\nIn 2013 he bought his favourite childhood basketball team Hapoel Jerusalem. His face lights up when he describes the moment they clinched their first-ever Israeli championship win two years later.\n\nHe\u2019s since sold the team but there have been reports of his interest in buying the Boston Celtics. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he responds. But he has invested in his first feature film \u2013 and hints there may be a big movie name attached. Meanwhile his social media posts attest to other hobbies like jet skiing, private jet travel to exotic island locations and drone flying.\n\nBut for all the fun big money brings, Allon repeatedly brings up the quest for something bigger. \u201cI sold two companies very quickly and think I was at a point in my life where I was like; \u2018OK, I want to build a business. I want to build a real business\u2019.\u201d\n\nFounding Compass\n\nWhich is how he and his partner Reffkin decided to think hard about industries they felt had been ignored by big tech and therefore were ripe for innovation. The duo chose real estate and Compass was born in early 2013. Burgeoning global investor appetite for the next tech \u201cunicorn\u201d as well as Allon\u2019s track record in selling \u2013 one business to Google and another to Twitter \u2013 ensured they had no trouble raising money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestors include Goldman Sachs, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity, chairman and CEO of American Express Kenneth Chenault, as well as Salesforce founder Marc Benioff. In 2017, Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp bought a share.\n\nSoftBank is headed by legendary tech investor Masayoshi Son, who has said that Compass is \u201cgoing to be a great unicorn\u201d. SoftBank's other bets include Uber and Slack, although lately it's best known for being the biggest investor in the now deeply troubled WeWork office space leasing firm.\n\nCompass began with 20 people in a midtown office that was once the set for the TV drama Law and Order, complete with sludgy green-coloured walls. Allon is chairman and his chief executive is Reffkin, who comes across as the more polished suit-wearing salesman of the two.\n\nOri Allon's seven-year-old real estate portal, Compass, took on a ninth round of funding, valuing it at more than $9 billion \u2013 and increasing his personal wealth from $539 million to $747 million.\n\nThe company relentlessly hammers its upbeat \u201creal estate reimagined\u201d philosophy. A YouTube video of last November\u2019s annual showcase at a glamorous theatre in Los Angeles looks like something Steve Jobs or Elon Musk would stage. Reffkin and his top executives spool out their goals and new products for the coming year as about 3000 Compass agents scream like iPhone fanatics.\n\nYet for all its gloss and excitement, not everyone is buying the hype. In April The Wall Street Journal described Compass as \u201cstill trying to figure out the business\u201d and said its \u201cfree-spending ways are rattling rivals and shaking up the industry\u201d.\n\nCritics say that for all the technology the company deploys, the basic business model is pretty standard, with Compass providing back-office support to agents for a share of the 5 to 6 per cent per commission they get on a deal.\n\n\u201cIf you talk to Compass agents they love the company and the brand \u2013 they have a swanky office, Reffkin is charismatic \u2026 there\u2019s a true positive atmosphere,\u201d Mike DelPrete, a real estate tech strategist at the University of Colorado Boulder, tells AFR Magazine. \u201cBut if you look at the economics, you scratch your head.\u201d\n\nIn a 35-page analysis posted mid-year, DelPrete questions its \u201cmassive valuation\u201d and whether it should be measured as a tech company or a real estate business.\n\nHe points out that others are in the race to combine the two, including Zillow, Redfin, Opendoor, Purplebricks and \u2013 perhaps ominously \u2013 recent entrant Amazon. Lawsuits have been aimed at Compass. \u201cYou can have tremendous tech [but] what is that tech doing?\u201d DelPrete says. \u201cMy analysis is that they\u2019re no more efficient than industry standard.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA key criticism is that Compass began aggressively expanding its market share in late 2017 after a number of large funding rounds \u2013 including the money from SoftBank. That money has been deployed to buy entire brokerages and lure star agents with attractive offers that existing real estate agencies can\u2019t match.\n\n\u201cCompass comes in decimating those companies,\u201d says DelPrete. They \u201cthrow money around, they don\u2019t have to worry about being profitable, which the family businesses have to be, and the agents leave with sweetheart deals.\u201d\n\nOne big US east coast broker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, tells AFR Magazine he has been offered \u201ca good bit of money\u201d to join the company several times and believes success will depend on whether Compass can win huge market share.\n\n\u201cThese are Wall Street people, they\u2019re technology people. They have a great sales pitch and, to some degree, a supportive platform,\u201d he says. But the push to eventually IPO the company \u2013 something Allon reiterates should happen in coming years \u2013 may simply end up benefiting the few \u201cat the top\u201d, says the broker.\n\nAllon firmly pushes back against such attacks: the commissions Compass pays its agents are in line with market rates so the company\u2019s attractiveness instead reflects its tech tools. Retention rates, he adds, are at \u201c98, 99 per cent\u201d. \u201cThey love Compass and love our tools and love the company and they want to stay here.\u201d\n\nYet Wall Street\u2019s appetite for flashy tech-based mega IPOs has soured badly of late, as investors question whether valuations are simply pumped up by today\u2019s easy money in a low interest-rate world. High-profile stockmarket entrances by giants like Uber, Peloton and Lyft have suffered spectacular post-listing tumbles amid earnings reports filled with cash burn.\n\nThe scrutiny is one reason for the northern summer\u2019s biggest corporate takedown \u2013 the decision by Millennial office space provider WeWork to yank its much-hyped IPO in September after investors baulked at its $US47 billion price tag.\n\nUS business pages have been buzzing with tales of corporate excess, tequila-fuelled partying and the exit of its once god-like founder, Adam Neumann.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch stories aren\u2019t good news for Compass, given the crossover with SoftBank. In late September, Compass announced the departure of its chief operating officer, Maelle Gavet. It follows recent exits by others including its general counsel, head of product and chief people officer, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhen AFR Magazine speaks with Allon after the WeWork float is pulled, a note of caution has crept in. Compass is being \u201cvery responsible\u201d and where it does expand, it is doing so at a pace \u201cwe can support with organic growth\u201d, he says.\n\nCompass also doesn\u2019t \u201cneed to raise money in the foreseeable future\u201d and, as it grows, \u201cis spending less money and making more money. It\u2019s a very different business than some of the others that you\u2019ve heard about recently,\u201d he says.\n\nHe\u2019s also cautious when it comes to talking about geographical expansion. A couple of months ago, when we first asked Allon about plans to grow abroad, he seemed upbeat about tackling markets such as London and Sydney.\n\nOnly a few weeks later he\u2019s saying expansion outside the US is a long-term goal for Compass. \u201cI\u2019m actually excited to do it, but I think it\u2019s going to happen at the right time.\u201d\n\nIt was rapid evolution in the tech sector that led Allon into his extraordinary life and away from Australia. Now, in an almost ironic twist, the same phenomenon could be stopping him from coming back. Australia\u2019s real estate agencies, it seems, can rest easy. For now.\n\nThe November issue of AFR Magazine, including the Young Rich List, is out on Friday, October 25 inside The Australian Financial Review.
