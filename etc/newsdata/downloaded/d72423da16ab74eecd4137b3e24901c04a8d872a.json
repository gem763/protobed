Even more surprising, less then half the starting line-up from the opening game of the 2018 World Cup can expect to be picked on Friday night in Prague.\n\nThis is about more than just evolution. This is about bravery: Southgate\u2019s bravery.\n\nHe is choosing to work without the traditional alliances and loyalties common to international management. He offers no more to his players than the chance to be picked if they stay in form.\n\nGareth Southgate offers no more to his players than the chance to play if they are in form\n\nThis is truly radical. Much has been made of Southgate\u2019s team-building qualities, yet here is a colder regime than Fabio Capello ever envisaged.\n\nInternational football traditionally demands greater constancy than the club game, where players rationalise the challenges of sustained form and fitness \u2014 in one week, out the next.\n\nDarren Fletcher says he grew used to being axed from the Manchester United side by Sir Alex Ferguson and instructed to prepare for a specific fixture several weeks ahead.\n\nBy contrast, there will be a nucleus of international footballers who expect to play, certainly in competitive games. They have limited opportunities, long periods between matches and the faith of the manager is important.\n\nKevin Keegan thought, as England captain, that Sir Bobby Robson should have told him he was being dropped from the squad in 1982. Equally, Brian Clough always argued he would never have treated England players as capriciously as he did the squads at Nottingham Forest or Derby. He knew a gentler approach was needed if they were to turn up and perform to their best.\n\nJordan Henderson is Southgate\u2019s sole survivor from Malta three years ago. That Henderson, Jordan Pickford, Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Harry Maguire are the only members of the team who opened up against Tunisia likely to start against the Czech Republic reveals Southgate to be a manager who brooks no compromise.\n\nLast time he jettisoned Marcus Rashford for Jadon Sancho and was rewarded with another impressive win. Yet what did Rashford make of it? Southgate\u2019s refusal to be worried by the demands of ego, from young or old, does him enormous credit. Yet it is also a gamble. He may need friends one day. His strategies suggest he is utterly unconcerned about having any.\n\nJordan Henderson is the sole survivor from Southgate's first game in charge three years ago\n\nGood for him. It is probably why he is so popular with England\u2019s fanbase. For years, they have wanted a team who were picked on the harshest reading of current form. They want the old guard out, the new blood in. They don\u2019t want to hear that Jesse Lingard has rarely let England down, if he is playing poorly for Manchester United. Neither, by the looks of it, does Southgate.\n\nFrom the moment he dropped Wayne Rooney, he has treated players the same regardless of reputation, history or even personal sacrifice. Kyle Walker moved from right back to a more central defensive role for the World Cup and previous managers might have thought he warranted some indulgence. Southgate dropped him without warning for this campaign. Lingard could have put England into the UEFA Nations League final were it not for the precision of VAR. It counted for nothing when Southgate named his most recent squad.\n\nTerry Venables, a huge influence on Southgate\u2019s managerial style, felt differently.\n\n\u2018I want to make the England squad as hard to get out of as it was to get into,\u2019 he announced early in his tenure. He wanted to inspire loyalty from a group who had considered his predecessor, Graham Taylor, too fickle.\n\nSimilarly, Jermaine Jenas had a very good game deputising for David Beckham in Azerbaijan in 2004 and Sven Goran Eriksson picked him for every gathering thereafter. He started just two matches, both friendlies, but was named in 20 consecutive squads. That is what a decent 90 minutes does traditionally for a player at international level.\n\nTerry Venables, a huge influence on Southgate, felt differently about the national squad\n\nSouthgate, however, is a man apart. Either he thinks he has a deep talent pool \u2014 which, given the limited choice of English players in the Premier League, is unlikely \u2014 or he is deploying the boldest strategy, one that may well leave players feeling unloved or unappreciated.\n\nAnd yes, playing for England is an honour, not a right. Yet it is also another demand in a crowded season. Expectations are always high, the pressure intense.\n\nJames Milner, who retired from international football, will never now be told he let his country down. But it is a taunt that could follow Kane from ground to ground if he misses a penalty in a vital game, or turns in poor performances during a disappointing tournament for England. It is why Venables sought to build a club mentality, a tight-knit group who knew their manager had faith.\n\nThere are other ways to achieve this, of course. At first, England\u2019s players despised Capello\u2019s austere regime. After a 4-1 win in Croatia in his second World Cup qualifier, however, the mood soon changed.\n\nAnd while Southgate is taking his team deep into tournaments and progressing breezily \u2014 England are through to the European Championship finals at a canter if victorious on Friday night \u2014 he can afford to work without a safety net.\n\nIt means one thing, though: he has to keep winning.\n\nHow Villa hit the wrong note\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that the song about Aston Villa\u2019s Marvelous Nakamba is racist. It says his dad\u2019s a \u2018rasta\u2019, presumably because he\u2019s black. It says John McGinn is his \u2018master\u2019, and we don\u2019t need to explain what is wrong with that.\n\nFinally, it makes stereotypical presumptions about a certain part of his anatomy. And Villa fans may think that counts as praise. It doesn\u2019t. Those who believe all black men are well-endowed tend to believe other labels, too: that they are thick, or lazy, or carry Ebola, or are Rastafarians.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that the song about Aston Villa's Marvelous Nakamba is racist\n\nYet what is also true is that few had a clue what the racist chant said, or that it even existed, until Villa made their misgivings public. There is a clip of it on YouTube and the words are unintelligible. To find out what was being sung required detective work that would have made Coleen Rooney proud.\n\nIn this way, it is much like Louie, Louie by The Kingsmen which the FBI investigated on the grounds of obscenity for 31 months before concluding that, as absolutely no one had a clue what lead vocalist Jack Ely was singing about, obscenity couldn\u2019t be an issue.\n\nVilla were right to call out the racism of a minority. Yet, in doing so, they gave the stupid song a wider audience than it ever deserved, or would have achieved, given the singers had mangled the English language as thoroughly as they had indulged in shameful black stereotyping.\n\nGrab some popcorn, sit back and enjoy Rooney v Vardy\n\nThis column has zero interest in the private lives of footballers, or their wives.\n\nIt has, however, got a reclining chair and a large bucket of popcorn out for Coleen Rooney v Rebekah Vardy and would gladly watch that ahead of the World Athletics Championships, darts, The Hundred or anything Tyson Fury has done in years.\n\nColeen Rooney v Rebekah Vardy is better to watch than the World Athletics Championships\n\nIt's not all about money\n\nHad England\u2019s men lost the Ashes 5-0 to Australia, there would have been sweeping changes. It is unlikely Joe Root would have remained as captain and Chris Silverwood certainly would not be the coach replacing Trevor Bayliss. Senior figures in the team would have played their last Test, newcomers would have found their careers swiftly curtailed.\n\nEngland\u2019s women, meanwhile, were swept aside by Australia in their Ashes equivalent. They lost every one-day international, were outplayed in the Test, which was rain-affected and ended drawn, and only took the last of three Twenty20s when the series was over. Mark Robinson stepped down as coach after four years.\n\nSince then? A \u00a320m cash injection and 40 extra professional contracts have been announced to help close the gap between the countries. There is a new action plan focusing on \u2018participation, pathway, performance, profile and people\u2019. Presumably it was brought to you by the letter P, like some editions of Sesame Street.\n\nIt is unlikely Joe Root would have remained as captain had England lost The Ashes 5-0\n\nThe problem with these ECB objectives is they all seem to have been dreamt up in marketing, like The Hundred. If problems are always perceived to be systemic, it avoids focus on individual performance.\n\nAustralia may have forged ahead in their investment in the women\u2019s game, but might there also be issues with talent and application? Grand plans always tack towards the same solution: Send more money.\n\nWhy Corbyn got Ashley all wrong\n\nIf he was any good, Jeremy Corbyn would be where Jurgen Klopp is now. A whopping eight points clear, his followers feverishly imagining the triumph ahead.\n\nIn fact, Klopp has it a lot harder than Corbyn.He has to see off Manchester City, who are rather good. Corbyn, meanwhile, is up against politics\u2019 equivalent of Manchester United under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nThe Conservatives used to be winners, they regard the big prizes as theirs by right but they are a shambles. Senior players have quit, what is left is mediocre, and the leaders have failed to deliver a coherent, workable strategy on a problem entirely of their making.\n\nYet still Corbyn trails them in the polls. It\u2019s a two-horse race, the other jockey is facing backwards, and he\u2019s coming third.\n\nThat\u2019s why he travels the country trying out populist tropes. He hasn\u2019t managed to formulate an opinion on the most important political issue since appeasement, but he\u2019ll head to Newcastle and preach to the converted.\n\nIf he was any good, Jeremy Corbyn would be where Jurgen Klopp is now, eight points clear!\n\nHe\u2019ll meet a pressure group called Ashley Out and then have a pop at Mike Ashley. Not exactly taking chances, is he? And he\u2019s hardly smart enough to get that right. Corbyn\u2019s attack on Ashley showed only the shallowest intellect or economic understanding.\n\nHe targeted the Newcastle owner\u2019s point of greatest strength, his sole trump card. It would be like ignoring Brexit and meeting Boris Johnson on the battleground of classical philosophy.\n\nAfter the usual entry-level cliches about football and community that could have been sketched on the back of a fag packet by the lowest-grade policy wonk, Corbyn accused Ashley of putting Newcastle\u2019s financial security at risk. Actually, that\u2019s the one thing he hasn\u2019t done. Marginalised the fans, yes. Placed business interests first, certainly. Yet Newcastle are financially stable under Ashley\u2019s stewardship. He runs a tight ship.\n\nIt had been going so well, too. Corbyn had singled out Ashley as a bad owner before an appreciative audience. So far, so tame. But when it became necessary to know something of his subject, to have bothered with detail beyond populist banalities, his argument fell apart.\n\nCorbyn's attack on Mike Ashley showed only the shallowest intellect or economic knowledge\n\nFar from risking Newcastle\u2019s financial security, the club under Ashley has made a profit before tax in seven of the last eight financial years.\n\nIn 2017-18 total staff costs as a percentage of turnover were 52 per cent when the Premier League average is 60 per cent. At the end of 2017-18 Newcastle had net assets of \u00a38.3m and a \u00a334m surplus in the bank. Non-interest bearing loans owed to Ashley totalled \u00a3144m, mostly dating from the beginning of his ownership.\n\nAlthough \u00a333m was repaid in 2018-19 \u2014 making \u00a3111m the current balance \u2014 those loans mean Newcastle have rarely relied on external interest bearing debt, due to Ashley\u2019s cashflow. In other words, he might be unpopular, he might have Sports Direct branding everywhere, he might have lost good players and better managers, but Newcastle are financially secure.\n\nLabour\u2019s problem has always been convincing the public the budget is safe in their hands and by failing to understand simple facts \u2014 such as wage-to-turnover ratio being a key financial health indicator in the assessment of football clubs \u2014 Corbyn came across as something of an economic ignoramus. It\u2019s probably why he isn\u2019t where Klopp is now.\n\nGiven that he\u2019s trailing Jo Swinson, too, he might be even nearer the end than Solskjaer.\n\nFIFA\u2019s firm stance on admitting women to football matches in Iran is a sham.\n\nThe governing body is in its usual orgy of self-congratulation after it was revealed women were permitted to attend Thursday\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Cambodia in Tehran. Females could buy 3,500 tickets in a venue that holds 78,000, a 4.4 per cent share.f\n\nYet how many women, as a percentage, typically make up the crowd at football stadiums? Who knows, because tickets aren\u2019t sold as part of gender quotas in any free society. Women could be 50 per cent of a gate, or 100 for that matter. And this is the freedom FIFA should demand for Iranian women, under threat of excluding their oppressors from international competition.", "description": "MARTIN SAMUEL - CHIEF SPORTS WRITER:  Gareth Southgate offers no more to his England players than the chance to be picked to play for their country if they stay in form.", "authors": ["Martin Samuel - Sport For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19556362-0-image-a-43_1570738960393.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
