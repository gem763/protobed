The intense quiet in the room was broken only by Calleija\u2019s occasional murmurs of approval at the gems\u2019 cut and clarity.\n\nThe stones themselves are always breathtaking, but this year\u2019s tender also had a heightened sense of nostalgia. The Argyle mine is set to close at the end of next year, now that its supply of economically viable jewels has been exhausted.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s getting really close, it\u2019s a matter of months,\u201d Calleija said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a big increase in demand at the moment. It seems to be just within the beginning of this year \u2014 people are more and more getting it.\u201d\n\nSince it opened in 1983, the mine has produced more than 865 million carats of rough diamonds for both ends of the price spectrum. Now it\u2019s down to the last 150 carats of polished pink diamonds.\n\nAs the biggest diamond producer by volume, and with more than three-quarters of its output composed of lower-value brown diamonds, the Argyle mine is at the centre of a global oversupply of cheap diamonds, eroding profits for nearly everyone. De Beers trimmed its production plans earlier this year amid a flood of polished diamonds and stagnant consumer purchasing.\n\nRBC Capital Markets and Panmure Gordon have predicted the closure could kick-start prices that have waned since 2011.\n\nFor pink diamonds the effect could be massive, says Larry West, owner of LJ West Diamonds in New York. \u201cThese are the rarest diamonds in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is nothing like it, and the mine can never be duplicated.\u201d\n\nDemand for Diamonds\n\nAccording to Rebecca Foerster, president for North America at Alrosa PJSC, the prices for pink diamonds have risen 300 per cent in the past decade.\n\n\u201cSince there are no other equitable sources of pink diamonds, we can expect that after the closure of Argyle mine over the next year, the market will face some shortage of pink diamonds supply,\u201d she says.\n\nRio Tinto\u2019s own data show that the prices for their Argyle pink diamonds have risen 500 per cent since 2000, though it won\u2019t reveal the specific amount bidders have paid at any of its tenders.\n\nBut industry insiders know. Olya Linde, a partner at Bain & Co. in Moscow who studies metals and mining, says pink diamonds go for about US$1 million to US$3 million a carat.\n\nIt\u2019s easier than ever to know the true value because, as West says, \u201cwe\u2019re in the information age, and people find out what is really rare and what isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTheories about the reason for the spike in prices vary, but Linde thinks it has to do with a concerted marketing effort by Argyle to promote itself as the \u201cgold mine,\u201d if you will, of pink diamonds.\n\nJewellers prize the Argyle \u201cname-brand\u201d stones even more than similar-quality gems from mines in Russia or South Africa. Each Argyle pink diamond comes with a certificate of authenticity.\n\nRio Tinto\u2019s tenders are legendary as well, with stops in Perth, Singapore, London, and New York before bids close. They\u2019re shrouded in secrecy as interested buyers place a sealed bid, and the winner is notified at the tender deadline.\n\nThere\u2019s also the role of pop culture. Ben Affleck proposed to Jennifer Lopez in 2002 with a 6.10-carat fancy intense pink diamond from Harry Winston, setting off a trend in coloured diamonds.\n\nIn general, says Sotheby\u2019s jewelry specialist Quig Bruning, success begets more success in the diamond industry. \u201cYou have a couple of stones that sell for really big numbers who get a lot of attention,\u201d he says.\n\nThe CTF Pink Star, an oval 59.60-carat mixed-cut Fancy Vivid Pink diamond mined by De Beers, set the world auction record for any diamond or jewel when it sold for US$71.2 million at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong in April 2017.\n\nIn 2018 the 18.96 Pink Legacy sold for US$50 million at Christie\u2019s auction house, breaking the world record for price paid per carat for a pink diamond at auction.\n\nLinde notes that future price increases will depend, as always, on demand, but there\u2019s no reason to think the luxury industry would lose its appetite for the pink stones, either to wear in jewelry or as an investment piece.\n\nFuture Supply\n\nRio Tinto will continue to tender its pink diamonds until the mine closes in 2020, says Alan Chirgwin, the company\u2019s vice president for sales and marketing. But jewellers are already starting to look elsewhere. \u201cThe thing about Argyle is that it\u2019s the only consistent source of pink diamond supply,\u201d Chirgwin says. \u201cWe see pink diamonds arise from time to time from other operations, but none produce in a consistent way like Argyle.\u201d\n\nThere are lab-grown pink diamonds as well, but the synthetic ones cost about 50 per cent less in retail and about 80 per cent less in wholesale, Linde says.\n\nAs technology improves, it\u2019s possible to artificially develop increasingly larger pink diamonds. But West, the New York diamond dealer, says, \u201cIt\u2019s not about what it looks like. It\u2019s the rarity that gives it the value.\u201d\n\nAn Auction Item\n\nThe Argyle closing is expected to bring renewed attention to pink diamonds at auction as buyers snap up limited supply.\n\n\u201cThese are collectibles, and there is an investment value considered,\u201d West says. \u201cEspecially in Australia, they have pink diamonds in people\u2019s portfolios for their retirement funds.\u201d\n\nIn its Magnificent Jewels sale on Dec. 10 in New York, Sotheby\u2019s will include two pink diamond items. A Fancy Red 1.38-carat diamond mined at Argyle is expected to go for US$1.8 million to US$2.8 million, while a pair of earrings from Harry Winston with pear-shaped Fancy Light Brown-Pink diamonds weighing 12.41 and 11.15 carats is estimated at US$600,000 to US$800,000.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "The Argyle pink diamond mine is set to close at the end of next year, now that\u00a0its supply of economically viable jewels has been exhausted", "authors": ["Claire Ballentine", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/argyle-pink.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
