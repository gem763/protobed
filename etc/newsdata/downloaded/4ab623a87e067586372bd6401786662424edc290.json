The court also cited the younger Cho\u2019s health in explaining why they decided not to detain him.An official in the prosecution said Cho\u2019s brother keeps claiming he needs to undergo surgery on his back but is refusing to submit any documents to prosecutors that specifically explain the surgery\u2019s schedule.Prosecutors apparently doubted the younger Cho\u2019s alleged injury from early on.On Oct. 8, Cho\u2019s brother was supposed to appear at the Seoul Central District Court to attend his warrant hearing and offer an oral testimony of his self-defense but didn\u2019t show up, citing that he was unwell.Seoul prosecutors traveled to a Busan hospital to check on his health - only to discover CCTV footage from the hospital that showed him \u201croaming\u201d around the halls with no hint of an injury, sources who were informed about the visit said.Prosecutors were also said to have found hospital documents that read he was caught smoking inside his V.I.P. room and was warned about it.Both pieces of evidence were submitted to the Seoul court that day, yet the younger Cho\u2019s pretrial detention warrant was nonetheless struck down.Cho\u2019s brother faces allegations of receiving hundreds of millions of won in bribes in exchange for offering jobs to teachers at Ungdong Middle School in Changwon, South Gyeongsang, which is run by the Cho family. Prosecutors are considering summoning Cho\u2019s mother, who\u2019s head of the board of directors at the Ungdong School Foundation, soon.BY KIM MIN-SANG, JEONG JIN-HO [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
