According to Clinton, impeaching President Trump must take place because \"We are in a crisis,\" she told PEOPLE Magazine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in favor of impeachment. I did not come to that decision easily or quickly, but this is an emergency as I see it,\" Clinton explained. \"This latest behavior around Ukraine, trying to enlist the president of Ukraine in a plot to undermine former Vice President Biden or lose the military aide he needs to defend against Trump\u2019s friend, Vladimir Putin \u2014 if that\u2019s not an impeachable offense, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President of the United States is betraying our country on a daily basis. This man who is in the Oval Office right now is a clear and present danger to the future of the United States,\" she said.\n\nThe Democrats have wanted to impeach Trump since he won the election, before he was even sworn in. They decided they didn't like him or his policies before he even implemented them.\n\nThe thing that is most amazing about these calls for impeachment: this entire impeachment saga is based on a whistleblower's account of Trump allegedly having a conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the conversation, Trump allegedly told Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, for corruption. Hunter sat on the board of directors for a Ukrainian oil company and was paid a large some of money to lobby his dad.\n\nEven if Trump did want Zelensky to investigate this alleged corruption, how is that an impeachable offense? What Democrats are essentially saying is that it's okay for people like the Bidens to \"pay to play\" and abuse their power but if someone like Trump suggests it's wrong and shouldn't take place, suddenly he is in the wrong.
