Source: Stenn\n\nThe recent announcements of JMW Turner as the new face of the \u00a320 note, and Alan Turing being featured on the new \u00a350, have reignited the debate about gender representation on banknotes.\n\nResearch by trade finance provider Stenn found that of the 117 legal tender currencies around the world featuring people, 88% are men.\n\nWhen excluding Queen Elizabeth, this figure rises to 91%. Only three currencies have a gender balance of less than 50% male when excluding the Queen \u2013 the Danish krone, Swedish krona, and Australian dollar.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince William favourite with Brits to feature on banknotes\n\nIn fact, 69 of the 177 currencies are 100% male, including the US dollar, Chinese yuan, and Indian rupee.\n\nTo redress this imbalance, Stenn replaced men with women on some of the world\u2019s major banknotes. It chose women with the most Wikipedia page-views in the 18 months between January 2018 and June 2019, excluding living women and royalty.\n\nFor the UK, Conservative prime minister Winston Churchill is replaced on the \u00a35 note by anti-imperialist and rebel Boudicca.\n\nOn the \u00a320 note, the mother of computer programs Ada Lovelace \u2013 who was perhaps unlucky not to be chosen for the new \u00a350 \u2013 replaces Adam Smith, the father of economics.\n\nSource: Stenn More\n\nThe \u00a310 already shows a woman in Jane Austen, while it seemed unfair to remove Alan Turing from the \u00a350 so soon after his announcement.\n\nFor the US, founding father Alexander Hamilton is replaced on the $10 with celebrated aviator and first woman to make a solo transatlantic flight, Amelia Earhart.\n\nSource: Stenn More\n\nOn the $100, Rosa Parks, who became an important face of the civil rights movement in 1955, after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger, replaces Benjamin Franklin.\n\nSource: Stenn More\n\nWhile Euro banknotes depict historical European architecture, not people, heroine of France and Roman Catholic saint Joan of Arc graces the \u20ac5 bill.\n\nSource: Stenn More\n\nGerman-born actress Marlene Dietrich, who received the Medal of Freedom in 1947 for her humanitarian efforts during the second world war, is a good choice for the \u20ac10.\n\nSource: Stenn More\n\nFor Russia, Anna Pavlova, prima ballerina of the Imperial Russian Ballet graces the 100 ruble (\u20bd100) bill.\n\nSource: Stenn More", "description": "Of the 117 currencies in the world, nearly 90% feature men.
