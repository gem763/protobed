His former boss, Mueller, is slated to testify Wednesday before Congress.\n\nThe DOJ, Mueller\u2019s office and Weissmann did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment on Monday.\n\nAt first blush, one might ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d It\u2019s not unusual for federal prosecutors to steal a page from Monty Hall\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Make a Deal\u201d script during plea negotiations.\n\nBut Weissmann\u2019s overture was wrapped with complexity and intrigue far beyond the normal federal case, my sources indicate.\n\nAt the time, pressure was building inside the DOJ and the FBI to find smoking-gun evidence against Trump in the Russia case because the Steele dossier \u2014 upon which the early surveillance warrants were based \u2014 was turning out to be an uncorroborated mess. (\u201cThere\u2019s no big there there,\u201d lead FBI agent Pete Strzok texted a few days before Weissmann\u2019s overture.)\n\nLikewise, key evidence that the DOJ used to indict Firtash on corruption charges in 2014 was falling apart. Two central witnesses were in the process of recanting testimony, and a document the FBI portrayed as bribery evidence inside Firtash\u2019s company was exposed as a hypothetical slide from an American consultant\u2019s PowerPoint presentation, according to court records I reviewed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn other words, the DOJ faced potential embarrassment in two high-profile cases when Weissmann made an unsolicited approach on June 4, 2017, that surprised even Firtash\u2019s U.S. legal team.\n\nTo some, the offer smacked of being desperately premature. Mueller was appointed just two weeks earlier, did not even have a full staff selected, and was still getting up to speed on the details of the investigation. So why rush to make a deal when the prosecution team still was being selected, some wondered.\n\nSecond, Weissmann\u2019s approach was audaciously aggressive, even for a prosecutor with his reputation.\n\nAccording to a defense memo recounting Weissmann\u2019s contacts, the prosecutor claimed the Mueller team could \u201cresolve the Firtash case\u201d in Chicago and neither the DOJ nor the Chicago U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office \u201ccould interfere with or prevent a solution,\u201d including withdrawing all charges. \u201cThe complete dropping of the proceedings \u2026 was doubtless on the table,\u201d according to the defense memo.\n\nFirtash\u2019s team suspected Weissmann\u2019s claim was exaggerated. While Mueller had full authority to investigate the Russia case, he wasn\u2019t an independent counsel separate of the DOJ but, rather, a special counsel subject to the attorney general\u2019s oversight.\n\nThe third red flag came in how much Weissmann communicated to Firstash\u2019s lawyers about his hopes for the Ukrainian oligarch\u2019s testimony.\n\nProsecutors in plea deals typically ask a defendant for a written proffer of what they can provide in testimony and identify the general topics that might interest them. But Weissmann appeared to go much further in a July 7, 2017, meeting with Firtash\u2019s American lawyers and FBI agents, sharing certain private theories of the nascent special counsel\u2019s investigation into Trump, his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortJohnson discussed conspiracy theory with former Ukrainian diplomat before Trump call: report Quid pro quo in Ukraine? No, not yet Ex-Clinton lawyer predicts at least one count of obstruction of justice from Trump impeachment inquiry MORE and Russia, according to defense memos.\n\nFor example, Firtash\u2019s legal team wrote that Weissmann told them he believed a company called Bayrock, tied to former FBI informant Felix Sater, had \u201cmade substantial investments with Donald Trump\u2019s companies\u201d and that prosecutors were looking for dirt on Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner Jared Corey KushnerPalestinian negotiator hits Trump team's 'empty words' in peace talks GOP vows to take new steps to protect Trump The Hill's Morning Report \u2014 Presented by Better Medicare Alliance \u2014 Impeachment angst growing in GOP MORE.\n\nWeissmann told the Firtash team \u201che believes that Manafort and his people substantially coordinated their activities with Russians in order to win their work in Ukraine,\u201d according to the defense memos. And the Mueller deputy said he \u201cbelieved\u201d a Ukrainian group tied to Manafort \u201cwas merely a front for illegal criminal activities in Ukraine,\u201d and suggested a \u201cRussian secret service authority\u201d may have been involved in influencing the 2016 U.S. election, the defense memos show.\n\nWeissmann\u2019s private observations and sharing of prosecutor\u2019s theories went beyond what prosecutors normally do in proffer negotiations and risked planting ideas that could lead the witness to craft his testimony, according to legal experts I consulted.\n\nRemarkably, Firtash turned down Weissmann\u2019s plea overtures even though the oligarch has been trapped in Austria for five years, fighting extradition on U.S. charges in Chicago alleging that he engaged in bribery and corruption in India related to a U.S. aerospace deal. He denies the charges.\n\nThe oligarch\u2019s defense team told me that Firtash rejected the deal because he didn\u2019t have credible information or evidence on the topics Weissmann outlined.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut now, as Firtash escalates his fight to avoid extradition, the Weissmann overture is being offered to an Austrian court as potential defense evidence that the DOJ\u2019s prosecution is flawed by bogus evidence and political motivations.\n\nIn a sealed court filing in Austria earlier this month, Firtash\u2019s legal team compared the DOJ\u2019s 13-year investigation of Firtash to the medieval inquisitions. It cited Weissmann\u2019s overture as evidence of political motivation, saying the prosecutor dangled the \u201cpossible cessation of separate criminal proceedings against the applicant if he were prepared to exchange sufficiently incriminating statements for wide-ranging comprehensively political subject areas which included the U.S. President himself as well as the Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinTrump's unimpeachable foreign policy Russia calls increased US military presence in Syrian oil fields 'banditry' Senate Dems slam Trump for shifting funds meant to deter Russia to border wall MORE.\u201d\n\nAfter years of litigation, the U.S. Justice Department won a ruling in Austria to secure Firtash\u2019s extradition to Chicago. But then his legal team secretly filed new evidence that included the Weissmann overture, and Austrian officials suddenly reversed course last week and ordered a new, lengthy delay in extradition.\n\nThat new court filing asserts that two key witnesses, cited by the DOJ in its extradition request as affirming the bribery allegations against Firtash, since have recanted, claiming the FBI grossly misquoted them and pressured them to sign their statements. One witness claims his 2012 statement to the FBI was \u201cprewritten by the U.S. authorities\u201d and contains \u201crelevant inaccuracies in substance,\u201d including that he never used the terms \u201cbribery or bribe payments\u201d as DOJ claimed, according to the Austrian court filing.\n\nThat witness also claimed he only signed the 2012 statement because the FBI \u201cexercised undue pressure on him,\u201d including threats to seize his passport and keep him from returning home to India, the memo alleges. That witness recanted his statements the same summer as Weissmann\u2019s overture to Firtash\u2019s team.\n\nFirtash\u2019s lawyers also offered the Austrian court evidence of alleged prosecutorial wrongdoing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA key document submitted to Austrian authorities to support Firtash\u2019s extradition was portrayed by DOJ as having come from Firtash\u2019s corporate files and purported to show he sanctioned a bribery scheme in India. In fact, the document was created by the McKinsey consulting firm as part of a hypothetical ethics presentation for the Boeing Co. and had no connection to Firtash\u2019s firm.\n\nMoreover, McKinsey claims in an official statement that it had no knowledge of a bribery scheme by Firtash, and the PowerPoint\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cbribery payments\u201d never came from Firtash or his company and were, instead, hypothetical \u201cassumptions by McKinsey about standard business practices in India,\u201d according to the new Austrian court filing.\n\nFirtash\u2019s U.S. legal team told me it alerted Weissmann to DOJ\u2019s false portrayal of the McKinsey document in 2017, but he downplayed the concerns and refused to alert the Austrian court. The document was never withdrawn as evidence, even after the New York Times published a story last December questioning its validity.\n\n\u201cSubmitting a false and misleading document to a foreign sovereign and its courts for an extradition decision is not only unethical but also flouts the comity of trust necessary for that process where judicial systems rely only on documents to make that decision,\u201d Firtash\u2019s American legal team wrote in a statement to me. \u201cDOJ\u2019s refusal to rescind the document after being specifically told it is false and misleading is an egregious violation of U.S. and international law.\u201d\n\nWeissmann long has been a favorite target of conservatives, in part because his earlier work as a prosecutor in the Enron case was overturned unanimously by the U.S. Supreme Court because of overly aggressive prosecutorial tactics. Former DOJ official Sidney Powell strongly condemned Weissmann\u2019s past work as a prosecutor in \u201cLicensed to Lie,\u201d a book critical of DOJ\u2019s pressure tactics.\n\nIt is now clear that Weissmann\u2019s overture to a Ukrainian oligarch in the summer of 2017 is about to take on new significance in Washington, where Mueller is about to testify, and in Austria, where Firtash\u2019s extradition fight has taken a new twist.\n\nJohn Solomon is an award-winning investigative journalist whose work over the years has exposed U.S. and FBI intelligence failures before the Sept. 11 attacks, federal scientists\u2019 misuse of foster children and veterans in drug experiments, and numerous cases of political corruption.
