Join the conversation below.\n\nThe bill also bans schools from preventing athletes from getting compensation or retaining agents. It covers all athletes at public or private colleges and universities in the state, according to its co-author, Sen. Nancy Skinner, a Democrat whose district includes the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nNCAA athletes can forfeit their eligibility if they receive direct payment for participating in sports, in practice restricting their compensation to tuition, room, board and a handful of other expenses. On Wednesday, the NCAA Board of Governors told California Gov. Gavin Newsom it would ban California athletes from competition if he signed the bill.\n\n\u201cIf the bill becomes law and California\u2019s 58 NCAA schools are compelled to allow an unrestricted name, image and likeness scheme, it would erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletics and, because it gives those schools an unfair recruiting advantage, would result in them eventually being unable to compete in NCAA competitions,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThese outcomes are untenable.\u201d\n\nWhen the bill was being considered in committee earlier this year, NCAA President Mark Emmert suggested in a letter to state legislators that \u201cit likely would have a negative impact on the exact student-athletes it intends to assist.\u201d\n\nLawyers who have represented athletes challenging NCAA rules scoffed at that suggestion, and said it seemed more likely that California would force the NCAA to follow its lead. They said dramatic differences between college athletes already exist. For example, Ivy League athletes don\u2019t get sports scholarships, while military school athletes are salaried.\n\n\u201cOne, I think it\u2019s very unlikely that the NCAA would want to exclude some of its most prominent members from competing. Two, if it did, I am sure those conferences and schools would file an antitrust challenge\u2026based on the fact that the NCAA would be organizing a group boycott,\u201d said Jeffrey Kessler, counsel to a class of athletes suing the NCAA over compensation rules.\n\n\u201cIf I had to predict the future, I think that the California legislation will become a standard that probably all the Power Five conferences will be allowed to adopt before 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NCAA letter pushed back against that suggestion and alleged the bill was unconstitutional, hinting at the prospect of litigation from both sides.\n\nNCAA Chief Legal Officer Donald Remy said Wednesday that courts had frequently sided with the association in upholding a demarcation between college athletes and paid professionals, and that the U.S. Constitution generally bars states from enacting laws seeking to regulate interstate commerce.\n\nCalifornia State University, Stanford University, the University of California and the University of Southern California stated their opposition to the bill while it was being considered in committee, according to the legislature.\n\nStanford\u2019s statement said that its athletic programs, like others\u2019, had agreed to the NCAA bylaws, with which the bill directly conflicted. USC said the bill would \u201cencourage students to violate the NCAA bylaws, becoming athletically ineligible and putting athletic teams and athletic departments at risk.\u201d The school cited penalties levied against its athletic program in 2010 after an investigation into rules violations in football, men\u2019s basketball and women\u2019s tennis.\n\nCalifornia legislators have frequently sought to buck national policies, relying on the state\u2019s size to carve its own path on issues from immigration to tailpipe emissions and influence the rest of the country to follow.\n\nThat approach has a high-profile backer. \u201cCalifornia can change the game,\u201d tweeted LeBron James, a basketball player for the LA Lakers, in one of several messages backing the bill earlier this week.\n\nThe NCAA argues compensation limits are necessary to maintain a distinction between college and professional sports, and that as amateurs, college athletes are adequately compensated through athletic scholarships and the chance to earn a college degree.\n\nAdvocates of expanded athlete compensation say competitors are exploited in a multibillion-dollar industry that rests on their labor, which in turn often limits their ability to earn the degrees for which they are enrolled.\n\nBut the issue has been fraught, and somewhat fluid. A commission on college basketball chaired by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reported last year that players should effectively be limited to tuition, room and board payments for now, but held back on issues like name, image and likeness benefits because of ongoing lawsuits.\n\nThe NCAA\u2019s working group on \u201cname, image and likeness\u201d is due to report its recommendations next month.\n\nIn March, a federal judge in Oakland, Calif., ruled in an antitrust case brought by athletes including former UC Berkeley basketball player Justine Hartman that the NCAA could no longer limit compensation or benefits for college athletes to those strictly related to education. That decision is being appealed.\n\nAnother prominent lawyer who has sued the NCAA said California was giving athletes the victory they have sought in litigation. \u201cThis bill mirrors what we are aiming at in court,\u201d said class-action plaintiffs attorney Steve Berman, of the case involving Ms. Hartman.\n\nThe California state Assembly passed the bill Monday by a vote of 73-0.\n\nThe legislation now heads to the desk of Mr. Newsom, a Democrat who negotiated changes for University of California athletes while he was lieutenant governor. His office said that he would evaluate the bill, but Mr. Newsom hinted at his stance Tuesday.\n\n\u201cLeBron James supports it for a reason, let\u2019s leave it at that,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com and Alejandro Lazo at alejandro.lazo@wsj.com", "description": "Lawmakers voted to require schools in the state to allow their athletes to earn endorsement money, setting up a collision with the NCAA, which bans compensation for college athletes beyond a scholarship and modest stipend.", "authors": ["Louise Radnofsky In Washington", "D.C.", "Alejandro Lazo In Sacramento", "Louise Radnofsky", "Alejandro Lazo", "Louise.Radnofsky Wsj.Com", "Alejandro.Lazo Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105936/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
