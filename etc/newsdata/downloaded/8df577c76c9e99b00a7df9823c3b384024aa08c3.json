It measures both how good major college football teams are on the gridiron, and how disgraceful they are off of it.\n\nEach team\u2019s location on the grid is determined by advanced numerical calculations and verified by the Journal\u2019s resident sports nerds, who make sure a team\u2019s location also reflects intangible factors that don\u2019t come through in the data.\n\nThe Grid features only legitimate Football Bowl Subdivision contenders: each of the 64 schools in the five major conferences, plus a handful of other relevant programs. This season that included independent Notre Dame and the University of Central Florida, among others.\n\nThe horizontal axis is straightforward: the more dominant a team is expected to be on the field, the farther right they land. Each team\u2019s ranking is a composite of several pre-season polls, some ordered by the eye tests, others by multivariable mathematical equations.\n\nThings get interesting on the vertical axis, otherwise known as the shame meter. The lower a team falls the more ignominy it heaps upon its fanbase.\n\nShame is quantified using a weighted calculation of several football-related factors: academic performance, recent NCAA violations and probation, attendance figures, athletic-department subsidies and arrests of players and coaches.\n\nThere are some offenses so outside the lines, however, that they can\u2019t quite be captured by numbers alone. That\u2019s where the \u201cick factor\u201d comes into play.\n\nAny school involved in a scandal, regardless of whether it happened during the last calendar year or directly implicated the university\u2019s football program, takes a hit. And with the non-stop headlines about college-sports scandals over the past year, there has been, if anything, an uptick in the number of teams moving lower on the shame axis. Enable a sexual predator for 20-plus years? You\u2019re going down. Let students buy admission by posing as recruits? Take a trip south.\n\nIn the end, how you feel is dictated by where you sit on the Grid. The upper right quadrant means you\u2019re a strong team that has come by your success respectably, like Washington\u2014a perennial contender for the Pac-12 title with few violations or arrests. The upper left is home to the Boston Colleges of the world: teams that are indisputably bad, but their demerits come from losing games rather than breaking rules.\n\nThen there\u2019s the bottom half of the grid. The lower right contains two of the three top-ranked teams\u2014Alabama and Georgia\u2014because they self-reported minor NCAA infractions. The lower left is the least coveted real estate on the Grid of Shame. These teams take a lot of L\u2019s, both on the field and off. One of the few areas where these schools excel? Testing their fans\u2019 loyalty. Buckle up Kansas faithful: you may have Les Miles, but you\u2019re in for a long season.\n\nMichigan State\n\nWorst among the offending teams is Michigan State, which failed to stop the serial abuse of Larry Nassar, a former university physician and USA Gymnastics national team doctor now serving a 175-year prison sentence. Both the Spartans\u2019 president and athletic director stepped down in early 2018.\n\nAdditionally, an ESPN report found that the members of Michigan State\u2019s athletic department habitually mishandled complaints of sexual assault, violence and gender discrimination involving members of its football and basketball programs.\n\nLet\u2019s just say it\u2019s not a great time to be a Spartan.\n\nMissouri\n\nThe University of Missouri was slapped with dozens of sanctions in February after a very lenient former academic tutor turned herself in for improperly helping athletes across several sports, including football, baseball and softball. That \u201chelp\u201d included taking placement exams, and in one case an entire course, on behalf of the athletes.\n\nAs part of its punishment, the university was placed on probation for three years and the Tigers\u2019 football, baseball and softball teams will be banned from the post-season in 2019. Sorry Kelly Bryant, no matter how good you are on the field you won\u2019t be playing in a bowl game come December.\n\nOhio State\n\nOhio State fell to the bottom of the grid because of the brouhaha related to former assistant coach Zach Smith\u2019s dismissal for alleged domestic violence before the 2018 season. After firing Smith, the university placed head coach Urban Meyer on administrative leave while it looked into whether Smith\u2019s behavior was previously known.\n\nIn its investigation, Ohio State did not attempt to recover deleted text messages from the phones of Meyer and athletic director Gene Smith, and promptly reinstated the head coach after three games. Coincidentally, Meyer announced 2018 would be his last season with the Buckeyes.\n\nCollege Admissions Scandal\n\nThen there are the schools involved in the college admissions scandal, which came to light this spring in an FBI investigation dubbed \u201cOperation Varsity Blues.\u201d The scheme masterminded by William \u201cRick\u201d Singer touched several top tier universities, but none more profoundly than the University of Southern California.\n\nSeveral USC officials allegedly made introductions between Singer and key figures within the Trojans athletics department. And documents seized by the FBI indicate Singer tried to get a client admitted by suggesting he post as a \u201ckicker or punter.\u201d The scandal also dinged several more schools, including Stanford, Texas, UCLA and Wake Forest.\n\nMinor NCAA Violations\n\nSeveral premier programs, including each of the top-three ranked teams, self-reported minor NCAA violations in the off-season, a tactic teams commonly use to incur milder punishments from the NCAA than if the infractions had been discovered through other means.\n\nAlabama admitted that one of its assistant coaches impermissibly called a recruit twice in one week outside of the designated contact period. Southeastern Conference rival Georgia mistakenly printed out a nametag for a sophomore prospect. Not to be outdone, No. 1 ranked Clemson self-reported 13 minor offenses, including but not limited to the unauthorized use of confetti during a prospective player\u2019s official visit.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Where does your team fall on this year\u2019s edition of the Grid of Shame? Join the discussion.\n\nMethodology: Teams\u2019 on-field rating is an average of the 2019 projected finish by two media outlets and two predictive models. Teams\u2019 off-the-field rating is a somewhat subjective rating of elements including Academic Progress Rate, recent history of NCAA violations and probation, athletic department subsidies, player arrests, attendance at last season\u2019s games, and overall ick\u2019 factor.\n\n\u2014Erik Brynildsen contributed to the design and graphics in this article.\n\nWrite to Laine Higgins at laine.higgins@wsj.com", "description": "The Wall Street Journal evaluates the country\u2019s top teams and how much their fans need to be embarrassed\u2014or proud\u2014of their program\u2019s off-the-field behavior.", "authors": ["Laine Higgins", "Graphics Dan Spector", "Laine.Higgins Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102431/social"}
