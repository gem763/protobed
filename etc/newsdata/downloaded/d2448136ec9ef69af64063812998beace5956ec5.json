That\u2019s as far back as Maryland\u2019s statute of limitations allows them to reclaim money.\n\nAccording to the Liberty Justice Center, which is representing the workers, nearly 10,000 state employees could collect about $7 million from AFSCME if the court rules in their favor.\n\n\u201cFor years, thousands of employees for the state of Maryland faced an unconstitutional situation: Pay the union or lose your job. But in 2018, the Supreme Court was very clear that these mandatory union fees violated the U.S. Constitution,\u201d said Patrick Hughes, president of the Liberty Justice Center.\n\nThe high court ruled in 2018 mandatory union fees run afoul of the First Amendment\u2019s rights of free speech and association, since the fees were spent on advocating for things such as larger public workforces that are inherently political and with which some members might disagree.\n\nThe holding upset more than 40 years of precedent that had previously allowed the dues for public sector unions.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday is just one of several currently pending throughout the country, trying to win refunds from unions. Mr. Hughes\u2019 organization has similar lawsuits pending in Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York.\n\n\u201cWe expect the district courts to rule on all these cases within the next year,\u201d Brian Kelsey, an attorney also representing the Maryland workers, told The Washington Times.\n\nMark Janus, the man who spearheaded last year\u2019s lawsuit at the Supreme Court, has also sued as an individual trying to collect his backpay, which is about $3,000. A district court judge ruled against him, but he\u2019s appealed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court will hear oral arguments later this month.\n\nPatrick Moran, president of AFSCME Maryland Council 3, called the lawsuit \u201cfrivolous,\u201d saying it was an attempt to undermine public service workers\u2019 rights and freedoms.\n\n\u201cSince Janus was decided in 2018, the Liberty Justice Center and their ilk have filed hundreds of similar cases; all of them have failed. Meanwhile, public service workers remain committed to their union. And with support for unions at a near 50-year high and nearly half of nonunionized workers saying they would join a union if they could, it\u2019s clear that more Americans want the freedom to join unions, and these organizations are trying to rob us of that freedom,\u201d Mr. Moran said.\n\nThe employees involved in the Maryland lawsuit were forced to pay an average of $400 a year in the dues.\n\nCharles Craver, a law professor at George Washington University, said he thinks the state workers may be able to collect money back from dues paid after the high court ruled for Mr. Janus last summer.\n\n\u201cI am not as confident that they could obtain refunds for dues paid prior to that decision given the fact that such dues payments were completely lawful under prior Supreme Court decisions,\u201d he said.\n\nMarley Weiss, a law professor at the University of Maryland, said she predicts the court won\u2019t certify a class action, which means the case will only involve a limited number of employees.\n\n\u201cIf the case is not certified as a class action, it will have little impact and may well be settled,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
