In it, TikTok maintained that its focus is entertainment, not politics, and no foreign government has a hand in its moderation policies.\n\nAccording to TikTok\u2019s post, all U.S. user data is stored in America and backed-up on servers in Singapore. Since the company purportedly doesn\u2019t maintain any data centres on Chinese soil, it\u2019s not beholden to Chinese law.\n\n\u201cLet us be very clear: TikTok does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China. We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked. Period,\u201d the post reads, refuting reports that TikTok censors content that may run counter to Chinese government propaganda, such as news on the ongoing Hong Kong protest or anything pro-LGBT.\n\n\u201cTikTok does not operate in China, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future,\u201d the post continues, though how that remains true when TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, is based in Beijing isn\u2019t explained.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Commerce added 28 agencies to its growing \u201cblacklist\u201d of Chinese companies banned from U.S. business ventures, a move Cotton applauded as a strike against the \u201cCommunist Party\u2019s dystopian surveillance state.\u201d", "description": "TikTok aimed to \u201cset the record straight\u201d Friday in a company blog post detailing its practices after U.S. Congress raised national security concerns about the viral video app among other China-owned properties earlier this week.
