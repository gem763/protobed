The FTC, which does not generally comment on investigations (or the existence of investigations), declined to comment.\n\nHowever, an Amazon official directed Bloomberg to a statement from Amazon Consumer Business chief Jeff Wilke, who was asked in June about reports the FTC was looking into Amazon.\n\n\u201dWe believe that most substantial entities in the economy deserve scrutiny,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is to build the kind of company that passes that scrutiny with flying colors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe interviews suggest the federal agency is in the early stages of a sprawling probe into Amazon\u2019s business practices to determine whether the company is breaking the law, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIn June, U.S. regulators struck a deal that placed Amazon under closer watch by the FTC, The Washington Post reported. The country\u2019s leading antitrust enforcement agencies agreed to divvy up competition oversight of Google, placing it under the Justice Department\u2019s watch, and Amazon -- a move that generally precedes increased antitrust scrutiny.\n\nThe report comes amid separate antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google, as lawmakers across the political aisle question whether big tech needs to be broken up. In July, Facebook agreed to pay a $5 billion fine for privacy violations.\n\nThe DOJ, at the end of July, opened a sweeping investigation into big tech to determine whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise hurt consumers.\n\n\u201cWithout the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\u201d DOJ antitrust head Makan Delrahim said in a statement at the time. \u201cThe department\u2019s antitrust review will explore these important issues.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The report comes amid separate antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Amazon-grab-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
