At the time of the alleged incident, in the early 1980s, she was heavily intoxicated, and feared the GOP would use that to discredit her. She was also reluctant to speak out after witnessing the relentless personal attacks launched against Ford.\n\nIn mid-September of last year, The New Yorker published an investigation into the alleged incident, in which Ramirez shared her recollection of what happened and said she believed an FBI investigation was \u201cwarranted.\u201d (Kavanaugh adamantly denied the allegations in a statement to the magazine, calling them \u201ca smear, plain and simple.\u201d)\n\nAfter the article\u2019s publication, many of Ramirez\u2019s worst fears came true: She was inundated with vitriolic threats, and Kavanaugh\u2019s defenders used her inebriated state at the time of the alleged assault against her. And though the FBI did investigate her claims, it yielded nothing. But according to a damning new report from the New York Times, that may have been because agents declined to interview numerous people with evidence that may have corroborated Ramirez\u2019s account \u2014 some of whom went out of their way to reach out to the FBI.\n\nBelow, here\u2019s everything we\u2019ve learned about Deborah Ramirez and her allegation against Kavanaugh, as well as the rushed FBI investigation into them.\n\nWho is Deborah Ramirez?\n\nRamirez is a 54-year-old woman who attended Yale University in the early 1980s \u2014 the same time as Kavanaugh. Today, she lives in Boulder, Colorado, where she has worked for Boulder County\u2019s Housing and Human Services department since 2013. Before holding that position, she worked as a victim\u2019s-advocate coordinator for the nonprofit Safehouse Progressive Alliance for Nonviolence, which aids victims of domestic violence.\n\nIn September 2018, she accused Kavanaugh of thrusting his penis in her face during a dorm party.\n\nJust days before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Ramirez became the second woman to accuse Kavanaugh of misconduct. Her account, which she detailed to Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer at The New Yorker, dates back to the 1983\u201384 academic year, when she and Kavanaugh were both freshmen at Yale. Ramirez says that she and other students became heavily intoxicated at a dorm party while playing a drinking game with a small group of students \u2014 Kavanaugh included \u2014 and that male students were playing around with a \u201cgag penis.\u201d But at some point during the night, Kavanaugh thrust his real penis in her face, Ramirez claims. Per The New Yorker:\n\n\u201cI remember a penis being in front of my face,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that\u2019s not what I wanted, even in that state of mind.\u201d She recalled remarking, \u201cThat\u2019s not a real penis,\u201d and the other students laughing at her confusion and taunting her, one encouraging her to \u201ckiss it.\u201d She said that she pushed the person away, touching it in the process.\n\nThough Ramirez admits that her memory of the incident is fuzzy, she says she can \u201cstill see [Kavanaugh\u2019s] face, and his hips coming forward, like when you pull up your pants,\u201d she said. Ramirez also told The New Yorker that after the alleged incident, a male student \u201cyelled down the hall, \u2018Brett Kavanaugh just put his penis in Debbie\u2019s face.\u2019\u201d (While The New Yorker did not confirm that Kavanaugh was at the party, and some of Ramirez\u2019s former classmates disputed her allegation, one former classmate said that he\u2019s \u201cone-hundred-per-cent sure\u201d that another former classmate at the time told him that Kavanaugh exposed himself to Ramirez.)\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to touch a penis until I was married,\u201d Ramirez, who was raised a devout Catholic, said of the incident. \u201cI was embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated.\u201d\n\nThe GOP launched a concerted effort to discredit Ramirez\u2019s claims.\n\nIn the same New Yorker report, Kavanaugh denied the accusation, calling it a \u201csmear, plain and simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so \u2026 I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name \u2014 and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building \u2014 against these last-minute allegations.\u201d\n\n(According to text messages obtained by NBC News, members of Kavanaugh\u2019s legal team were quietly working behind the scenes to refute Ramirez\u2019s claim, reaching out to potential witnesses as early as July \u2014 a full two months before Ramirez decided to come forward. The texts also suggest that days before The New Yorker article was published, Kavanaugh himself was talking with former classmates about Ramirez\u2019s claims.)\n\nRamirez\u2019s accusation also elicited a response from Trump, who told reporters during a meeting at the U.N. General Assembly that Ramirez \u201chas nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe thinks maybe it could have been him, maybe not,\u201d he said. \u201cShe admits that she was drunk. She admits that there are time lapses.\u201d\n\nThose who knew Ramirez, though, stood alongside her.\n\nFollowing The New Yorker\u2019s report, a range of supporters, from Democratic politicians to Kavanaugh\u2019s former roommate, spoke out in solidarity with her, and many of her former classmates vouched for her integrity.\n\n\u201cAlthough Brett was normally reserved, he was a notably heavy drinker, even by the standards of the time, and \u2026 he became belligerent and aggressive when he was very drunk,\u201d Kavanaugh\u2019s former roommate James Roche said in a statement. \u201cBased on my time with Debbie, I believe her to be unusually honest and straightforward and I cannot imagine her making this up. Based on my time with Brett, I believe that he and his social circle were capable of the actions that Debbie described.\u201d\n\nRecent reporting calls into question how thorough the FBI\u2019s investigation was.\n\nIn October 2018, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the court after the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded that there was \u201cno corroboration of the allegations\u201d made by Ford and Ramirez. But after a ten-month investigation, New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly were able to find several people who could corroborate Ramirez\u2019s account.\u201d Per a New York Times report published on September 14, which adapted reporting from the Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s forthcoming book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, at least seven people \u2014 including Ramirez\u2019s mother \u2014 had heard about the allegation years before Kavanaugh became a federal judge. Additionally, Ramirez submitted a list of \u201cat least 25 individuals who may have had corroborating evidence\u201d to the FBI last year \u2014 but not a single person on it was interviewed, even though some had attempted to reach out to the agency on their own.\n\nThis is not the first time the adequacy of the FBI\u2019s investigation has been called into question. In an op-ed published in the Indianapolis Star in October 2018, William Scheuerman, one of Kavanaugh\u2019s former Yale classmates, says he attempted to contact the FBI and was \u201crebuffed,\u201d and called the investigation a \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promised a list of names of people who may have attended the party at which Ramirez claims to have been assaulted,\u201d wrote Scheuerman, who currently serves as a political-science professor at Indiana University. \u201cThe FBI never returned my call. Based on what has now been revealed about the FBI report, I do not believe that the FBI contacted people on that list.\u201d\n\nThe Times report has prompted renewed calls for impeachment.\n\nIn the days since the Times published its report, Democratic presidential candidates and politicians have called for a new investigation into the claims, as well as Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201cLast year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him,\u201d Elizabeth Warren tweeted. \u201cConfirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\u201d\n\nLast year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 15, 2019\n\nThe revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 15, 2019\n\nI sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice.\n\n\n\nHe must be impeached. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 15, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached.\n\n\n\nAnd Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter. https://t.co/Yg1eh0CkNl \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) September 15, 2019\n\nWe saw right through you then, we see right through you now. #ImpeachKavanaugh pic.twitter.com/81I80QR6tW \u2014 Ayanna Pressley (@AyannaPressley) September 16, 2019\n\nStay in touch.
