The document instead refers readers to the government\u2019s AusTender database for details of individual contracts and suppliers.\n\nBut an examination of the database shows the department entered into almost $1.6 billion worth of contracts categorised as some form of consulting service, but not tagged as consultancy.\n\nDefence maintains the published figures are correct. The department has more consultants, contractors and labour-hire staff than public sector workers.\n\nMr Hill said Australians deserved to know where taxpayer dollars were spent and called on the Coalition to be more forthcoming.\n\nThe previous inquiry, chaired by Liberal senator Dean Smith, received more than 100 submissions and held three days of public hearings but decided not to issue a report before the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If this government continues to limit the capability of the public service, at the very least Australians need to be assured that the work being done to support the business of government by external contractors is value for money and reported in line with community expectations,\" Mr Hill said.\n\nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann told Senate estimates hearings last week that the cost of government administration, including contractors and consultants, had decreased under the Coalition.\n\nThe data he cited was based on reports derived using the consultancy tag in AusTender.\n\nHe said as a proportion of total government spending, consulting costs had decreased from 8.5 per cent in 2007-08 to 7 per cent in 2018-19.\n\n\"I expect it to further decrease to 5.4 per cent by 2022-23,\" Senator Cormann told a Senate committee.", "description": "Labor wants a parliamentary inquiry into the government's $50 billion outsourcing bill reopened, after it lapsed without issuing a report before the May election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_37/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4e7dabac24b0a71b6812b14e61e69aa985270901", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
