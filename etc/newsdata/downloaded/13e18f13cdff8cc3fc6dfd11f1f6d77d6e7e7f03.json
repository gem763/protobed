That N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is an exceptional footballer is no revelation but there is still something remarkable about the fact that the best holding midfielder in the world has become a totemic Roy of the Rovers figure at Chelsea. There he is darting across his own box to stifle a Liverpool attack. There he is slipping a pass in to the edge of the box and looking for a return. And there he is, drifting in from the right and finding the top corner with an ungainly but nonetheless precise finish. He is their alpha and their omega, their beginning and their end. He is all things to all men and by that means he might save some games \u2013 but not this one.\n\nKant\u00e9 was exceptional against Liverpool, in the second half a blur, the force driving Chelsea forward. Only one Chelsea player made more tackles than him, only one more interceptions than him, only one had more shots than him and nobody completed more dribbles than him. He has, against expectations, transformed himself into a complete midfielder.\n\nRoberto Firmino rises above Chelsea to keep up Liverpool\u2019s perfect start Read more\n\nBut seeing him play like that it is impossible not to feel a certain ambivalence. Why is he having to do this? Ultimately, for all that it fits football\u2019s love of narrative and its continuing obsession with individuals, Roy of the Rovers football is for comics. Steven Gerrard pulled off more implausible feats than was reasonable and gave defining performances in the finals of the FA Cup and Champions League but, as his time at Liverpool showed, that is no way to mount a consistent challenge in the league.\n\nChelsea had a supremely gifted holding midfielder, somebody who had been instrumental to two title wins with two different sides and had then lifted the World Cup, but opted to bring in a very different player who operated in his position to satisfy the demands of Maurizio Sarri. The result has been Kant\u00e9 operating in a more advanced position that has forced him to learn new tricks.\n\nProfoundly gifted and diligent as he is, he has. He may have skewed one chance wide from the edge of the box on Sunday but he then scored with a little scuttle in-field and precise shot into the top corner. But, remarkable as that strike was, it was only his 15th league goal in a career now in its eighth season of regular senior football.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 drives past Liverpool\u2019s defence to score for Chelsea late in the second half.

And so the issue persists: Jorginho, frail and neat, playing his cerebral passes and looking a little bewildered by the tumult around him, Kant\u00e9 charging forward rather than controlling the area just in front of the defensive line as he used to.\n\nWith Kant\u00e9 in the side from the start for only the third time this season, Chelsea looked a little more secure than they have done, less vulnerable to attacks through that central area. But still, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that fielding him and Jorginho together creates needless complications.\n\nThat Liverpool\u2019s two goals here came from free-kicks, following the concession to a free-kick against Valencia last Tuesday makes defending from set-plays a specific and immediate concern. The first was a ferocious drive from Trent Alexander-Arnold but it was noticeable that Jorginho, whose job was to charge down the taker after it had been laid off, ended up making himself as small as possible. Defending, it is fair to say, does not come naturally to him.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nTo criticise Frank Lampard for that is perhaps a little unfair. The issues of personnel pre-date him and are a result of Chelsea\u2019s piecemeal approach to recruitment. But conceding 16 goals in eight games this season is a problem that requires urgent attention.\n\nKant\u00e9 is clearly a large part of the solution but he cannot be all the solution. An all-round performance such as he produced on Sunday, particularly in the second half, is a paradoxical kind of excellence. On the one hand a display as remorseless and intelligent as that must be admired; on the other the fact that it was necessary, perhaps even that it was possible, speaks of profound structural deficiencies.", "description": "Chelsea\u2019s signing of Jorginho means the midfielder N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is in a more advanced position, displaying new tricks on top of his excellence in a defensive role", "authors": ["Jonathan Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c4e8cfa842d87be15fc4d68002d454388fe2a4/0_657_7087_4253/master/7087.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d62158882dd84c1ebd57e9f1b508d087", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
