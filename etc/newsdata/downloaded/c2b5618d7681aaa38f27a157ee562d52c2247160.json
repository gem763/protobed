The detailed stories on Weinstein published by The New York Times and The New Yorker in 2017 shared a Pulitzer Prize and are credited with igniting the global #MeToo movement.\n\nFarrow\u2019s book also makes repeated references to former National Enquirer editor in chief Dylan Howard, whose lawyers sent letters to Australian booksellers threatening lawsuits.\n\nAmazon Australia and Booktopia declined to comment Thursday on their decisions not to sell Farrow\u2019s book.\n\nA number of smaller Australian book retailers received letters from Howard\u2019s law firm McLachlan Thorpe Partners, but most did not.\n\nLawyer Andrew Thorpe, who signed the letters, did not respond when asked by AP who had received them.\n\nOne letter shown to The Associated Press said Howard believes the book contains \u201cfalse and defamatory allegations.\u201d The letter warns that if the Australian publisher, Hachette Australia, is sued for defamation, \u201cour client will have no alternative but to join you as a party to those proceedings as a distributor.\u201d\n\nHachett Australia spokeswoman Anna Egelstaff declined to comment on the legal threat but said the book had been distributed as planned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been distributed widely across Australia. It\u2019s now available in bookshops and some online retailers,\u201d Egelstaff said.\n\nFarrow tweeted that some Australian book outlets had \u201ccaved and banned it due to frivolous legal threats.\u201d\n\nFarrow added that he hoped Australian readers \u201ccan import or buy from an independent bookseller, and avoid outlets that yield to these kinds of intimidation tactics.\u201d\n\nRobbie Egan, chief executive of the Australian Booksellers Association, said the two big online retailers were the only Australian outlets he knew of that had decided against stocking the book.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no legal threat: it\u2019s just the threat of the possibility of legal threat,\u201d Egan said. \u201cI can\u2019t recall anything like this and I\u2019ve been doing it (selling books) for 25 years.\u201d\n\nDavid Gaunt, owner of Gleebooks in Sydney, said he had not been notified by the publisher or anyone else of a legal threat. He had sold out of the book by Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way it would have got the publicity that it\u2019s got if it hadn\u2019t been for the attempt to ban it,\u201d Gaunt said. \u201cUnless people contacted the publisher to say: \u2018What should I do?\u2019, the publisher is being very relaxed about the whole thing.\u201d\n\nMark Rubbo, managing director of Melbourne retailer Readings, said he disregarded the legal letter he received because of the important issues the book raised.\n\n\u201cThe letter just said it may contain defamatory content - so it didn\u2019t say it did - and I didn\u2019t feel that was a strong enough reason not to sell it,\u201d Rubbo said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ronan Farrow's new book is being sold in Australia despite threats of defamation lawsuits that the Pulitzer-winning journalist believes led some Australian retailers to drop the bestseller.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rod Mcguirk"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/australia_farrow_book_56719_c0-133-3186-1991_s1200x700.jpg?bcea235583975bbc06a33d28daef7e259917fd3b", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
