Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) falsely claimed during CNN\u2019s Democrat debate in Westerville, Ohio, Tuesday night that the majority of Trump voters want gun control.\n\nKlobuchar dodged a question from CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper about supporting a mandatory buyback of guns before responding to Cooper, falsely claiming that the \u201cmajority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe public is with us on this in a big way. The majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks right now. The majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation,\u201d Klobuchar said on the debate stage.\n\nHer claim, however, is false. A Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted September 2-5 found that only 33 percent of Republicans supported a nationwide ban on assault weapons, and only 31 percent of Republicans supported a mandatory buyback program.\n\nMoreover, she failed to mention that 63 percent of gun owners buy their guns for self-defense while 40 percent of gun owners buy their guns for hunting, according to a Gallup poll taken between August 15-30.\n\nThe polls also failed to distinguish registered Republicans from Trump supporters, as the surveys fail to count Republicans who do not support President Donald Trump.\n\nBut despite her false claim, Klobuchar vowed to \u201cbring in an assault weapon ban\u201d if elected president and place a limit on magazines.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m president, I do want to bring in an assault weapon ban, and I do want to put a limitation on magazines so what happened in Dayton, Ohio, will never happen again,\u201d Klobuchar said.", "description": "Sen.
