And it came by way of a defense that\u2019s had trouble keeping up with UCF (4-2, 1-1).\n\nIn addition to Gardner\u2019s 16-yard interception return, the Bearcats picked off Gabriel\u2019s passes at the Cincinnati 2 and 6 as they took control and closed it out.\n\nUCF\u2019s Tre Nixon turned a short pass into a 45-yard touchdown that cut it to 27-24 with 3:11 to go, but the Bearcats ran out the clock, converting a fourth-and-1 at midfield in the closing seconds.\n\nGabriel came in leading the AAC in passing efficiency, but finished 25 of 46 for 297 yards with three decisive interceptions against a pressing defense that dared him to throw deep. The true freshman also botched a handoff at the UCF 19 that set up the first of Desmond Ridder\u2019s two touchdown passes and got the crowd chanting \u201cOverrated!\u201d\n\nThe Knights had scored at least 30 points in each of their last 31 games, the longest such FBS streak since 1936.\n\nRidder was 17 of 31 for 149 yards. He also threw an interception that set up Greg McCrae\u2019s 1-yard touchdown run with 58 seconds left in the half that put UCF ahead 16-10 lead.\n\nGardner changed the game by stepping in front of a sideline pass and returning an interception 16 yards untouched in the third quarter, and Gabriel couldn\u2019t rally the Knights. Michael Warren II had a 61-yard run that set up Ridder\u2019s second touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter for a 27-16 lead.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUCF: The Knights\u2019 lack of experience at quarterback cost them their long streaks of conference wins and 30-point games.\n\nCincinnati: After giving up 51 and 38 points in its last two losses to UCF, the Bearcats started preparing for their quick-snap offense during camp. After UCF opened the game with a field goal drive, the Bearcats\u2019 defense settled in and took control.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nUCF\u2019s second straight road loss leaves the Knights in a tenuous spot. They were ranked No. 15 when they lost at Pittsburgh 35-34 on Sept. 21.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUCF is off next week before hosting East Carolina on Oct. 19.\n\nCincinnati plays at Houston on Oct. 12.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ahmad Gardner returned an interception for a go-ahead touchdown and Cincinnati clamped down on freshman quarterback Dillon Gabriel and No. 18 UCF's high-scoring offense Friday night for a 27-24 victory that ended the Knights' streak of 19 conference wins.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Kay"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/ucf_cincinnati_football_76428_c0-104-2492-1556_s1770x1032.jpg?8ffbaf5e3f834ca5288df6467fe9160f67002e15", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
