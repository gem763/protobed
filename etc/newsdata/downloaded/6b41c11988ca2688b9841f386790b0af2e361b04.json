Bush, and Jack Kemp, and has also served as a media and political consultant for Russian and Ukrainian interests. Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, he has frequently appeared on TV news to defend the president and his agenda.\n\n\u201cPutin is the only winner in the Russia hoax because he\u2019s managed to turn our nation against itself,\u201d Caputo said in a brief statement. \u201cAs the only person dragged into the investigations who\u2019s worked with the White House and the Kremlin, I\u2019ve got a story to tell, and I\u2019m delighted to work with Bombardier Books to tell it.\u201d\n\nCaputo himself became a minor character in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s two-year investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and was interviewed by Mueller\u2019s team. As a result of the multiple Russia probes in which he was ensnared, Caputo says his family and his business suffered, with legal bills totaling in the hundreds of thousands, his company shedding roughly three-quarters of its clients, and half of his staffers getting laid off.\n\n\u201cWhy did my family, my children, myself, my company, my employees, my clients, why did they all get trashed?\u201d Caputo said earlier this year.\n\nShortly after the Mueller investigation concluded and the special counsel\u2019s report was sent to the Justice Department, President Trump welcomed his one-time adviser to the Oval Office for an informal conversation. It was the first time the president and his 2016 aide had talked for two years, ever since Caputo had become a fixture of the Trump-Russia investigations.\n\nAccording to Caputo, the president discussed exacting revenge on Democratic lawmakers who\u2019d crossed him on Russia and obstruction matters, and assured Caputo that\u2014with the Mueller probe in the rearview\u2014he\u2019d stay in touch.", "description": "The book is billed as \u201can inside narrative of the decades-long covert political war between Moscow and Washington\u201d up to and including the Trump era.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570683565/191009-Swin-Michael-Caputo-tease_mmf5wj", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
