His Test debut came in style with a brilliant century at Lord's in 1996. Having represented India in over 400 international games, Ganguly was one the best players in the world in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThis is a new innings for him and no doubt he will lead from the front, just like he did as skipper.\n\nWith Inputs From PTI.", "description": "Sourav Ganguly has taken over as the BCCI's 39th president.
