But some centrist Democrats remain skittish about any proposal that keeps firearms from law-abiding citizens \u2014 a frequent charge against Democrats by Republicans and gun rights groups \u2014 making any such ban politically risky for moderates in Trump-friendly districts. In the Senate, it draws less support\u2026\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the sponsor of the current assault weapons measure, who described himself as a \u201chuge proponent\u201d of the ban. \u201cEvery other bill that we\u2019ve done tries to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\u2019t have them. This is the one piece of legislation that keeps a particular weapon out of the hands of law-abiding citizens. A lot of people have enormous objections to that.\u201d\n\nInstead, as they wait for President Trump to make an announcement \u2014 possibly as early as Thursday \u2014 about what kind of gun legislation he would support, Democrats are single-mindedly focused on hammering on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to take up a House-passed bill expanding background checks to cover sales at gun shows and online.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Assault-Weapons-Ban-Democrats.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
