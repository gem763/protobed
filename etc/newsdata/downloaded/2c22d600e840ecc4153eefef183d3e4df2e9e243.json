Turkey regards the Kurds as terrorists and is thought to have as much or more interest in targeting them as it does in continuing the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany high-profile Republicans spoke out Monday, and while some didn\u2019t mention Trump directly, many rebuked him in no uncertain terms.\n\nRegular Trump critic Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) called it \u201ca betrayal\u201d of the Kurds.\n\nThe President\u2019s decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp \u2014 Senator Mitt Romney (@SenatorRomney) October 7, 2019\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said the decision would probably lead to a \u201cslaughter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the President sticks with this retreat, he needs to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children,\u201d Sasse said.\n\nBut while Romney, Sasse and others have criticized Trump on many occasions, some top allies spoke out, too.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3 House Republican, called it a \u201ccatastrophic mistake that puts our gains against ISIS at risk and threatens America\u2019s national security.\u201d Cheney referred to the Islamic State by its other name.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTerrorists thousands of miles away can and will launch attacks against America, as the United States learned on September 11, 2001,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cPulling out of northern Syria ignores that painful lesson, represents an abandonment of our Kurdish allies despite their vital contributions to the fight against ISIS, emboldens Iran, and serves as an undeserved gift to the [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan] regime, which has only continued its steady march toward Moscow.\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said it would \u201cbe DISGRACEFUL if we sat idly by while Turkey slaughters the Kurds, as public reports suggest that Turkish leader Erdogan explicitly told President Trump he intends to do.\u201d\n\nEven former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, who picks her spots carefully when criticizing Trump, said the decision was tantamount to \u201cleaving [the Kurds] to die.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend \u2014 Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) October 7, 2019\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said, \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s most striking critic, though, was one of his most loyal allies. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) unleashed an extensive tweetstorm featuring dire predictions, including the revitalization of the Islamic State. He called the whole thing \u201ca disaster in the making.\u201d\n\n* Ensures ISIS comeback.\n\n* Forces Kurds to align with Assad and Iran.\n\n* Destroys Turkey\u2019s relationship with U.S. Congress.\n\n* Will be a stain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nI feel very bad for the Americans and allies who have sacrificed to destroy the ISIS Caliphate because this decision virtually reassures the reemergence of ISIS. So sad. So dangerous.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump may be tired of fighting radical Islam. They are NOT tired of fighting us. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\n* Turkey does not have the capability to keep ISIS from re-emerging and their primary target is the Kurds \u2013 not ISIS.\n\n\n\n* It would be unwise to believe otherwise. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nThe situation recalls what happened a month ago, when Trump tweeted out of the blue that he had canceled a previously unknown summit with the Taliban at Camp David. While Republicans praised him for canceling it, they didn\u2019t seem to know what to do with the fact that he had scheduled it in the first place \u2014 given the almost unthinkable optics of it all.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTensions soon boiled to the surface, with some of Trump\u2019s more hawkish GOP supporters apparently worried that he was headed toward a policy of appeasement and non-interventionism. Graham began directly criticizing Trump for emboldening Iran with his nonresponse to a U.S. drone being shot down there. Cheney then found herself feuding with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) over whose noninterventionist foreign policy vision was more akin to Trump\u2019s \u2014 a remarkable metaphor for the GOP\u2019s foreign policy crossroads, with a Cheney scion arguing with a Paul scion.\n\nAnd if Sunday\u2019s developments were any indication, the Paul wing of the party appears to be gaining the upper hand. In some ways, we\u2019re now having the debate we could have had over the new year, when top Trump administration officials including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned over Trump\u2019s announced complete withdrawal from Syria. Trump eventually decided to keep some forces in the country, forestalling what we\u2019re seeing today.\n\nBut now, that trajectory appears to have taken hold. The question from there is what the other side of the party \u2014 which accounts for the vast majority of top GOP policymakers and is united in many ways with congressional Democrats \u2014 is going to do about it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo this point, they have passed resolutions of disapproval, such as when Trump declined to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the death of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi. But those resolutions weren\u2019t binding. They have also voted to end U.S. involvement in the Saudis\u2019 proxy war in Yemen, but there were limited GOP defections on that one, and Trump was able to veto it.\n\nGraham has floated legislation including a resolution opposing the Syria decision, and he said he\u2019s in talks with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) about bipartisan legislation to punish Turkey if it overreaches.\n\n\u201cWe will introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria and will call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the U.S. in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate,\u201d Graham said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRomney issued a joint statement with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), with whom he leads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s counterterrorism subcommittee, saying administration officials must come to Capitol Hill and explain themselves.\n\nFor now, they seem to be hoping for a quick reversal; McConnell said in his statement, \u201cI urge the President to exercise American leadership.\u201d Short of that, though, Trump\u2019s Senate critics on this have the option to show some of their own leadership, if they are willing to do so. One way to halt such an allegedly disastrous decision would be for Republicans to reclaim some of the powers they have handed to the presidency when it comes to the war on terrorism. Congress could mandate that the administration take steps to protect the Kurds, for instance, or it could pass a new Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) laying out exactly what decisions are the commander in chief\u2019s to make in Syria.\n\nThat would be a stunning step, but these Republicans are talking in no uncertain terms about this leading to a \u201cslaughter\u201d of U.S. allies and rekindling the most serious foreign terrorist threat the United States faces. If those are the stakes, how could you not go that far because of uneasy domestic intraparty politics? Negotiating with the Taliban or taking too soft of an approach to Iran is one thing; saying something endangers the U.S. homeland and then not really doing anything about it would be a remarkable capitulation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey also have to worry about the direction in which all of these data points are increasingly pointing. Republicans have treated Trump with kid gloves on these issues, and he seems only to have been emboldened to go in the opposite direction. What happens next is an important moment in the evolution of American foreign policy. Thus far, Republicans clearly haven\u2019t made much impact through tough words and nonbinding resolutions.\n\nAD", "description": "Few decisions have caused such massive and immediate alarm in the president's own party.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/i2t8YhmNK4i1ADIP2hzNrSjQLuM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EJKQT5SAJEI6TBNNO6PPAX6Z3A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
