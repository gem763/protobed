He told this newspaper it appears the government has engaged in a conscious policy of cooperating with torture since 9/11, saying it is \u201cimpossible\u201d the practice was not approved or at least tolerated by top officials.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Such grounds were established by evidence published by Parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) in 2018 which showed British intelligence agencies have been involved in torture and rendition cases since 9/11, the letter said.\n\n\u201cThe interesting question is not whether the UK was involved in torture because you already have the evidence.

The government must respond within 21 days.\n\nMaya Foa, the director of Reprieve, said: \u201cThe powerful must be held to account so that victims can move on with their lives, but just as importantly because if we do not fully investigate our past mistakes, we are doomed to repeat them.\u201d\n\nMr Davis, a veteran Conservative MP and former minister, accused the government of \u201cyears of dither and delay\u201d.\n\n\u201cTorture doesn\u2019t produce reliable intelligence, and involvement in it makes everyone in this country less safe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe must take a clear-eyed look at this dark period in our recent history, and give victims the redress and accountability they were promised, and face the future with a clear conscience and determination not to repeat the mistakes of the past.\u201d\n\nParliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee published two reports in June 2018 which revealed the UK\u2019s oversees intelligence service MI6 and the domestic spy agency MI5 were involved in hundreds of torture cases and scores of rendition cases since 9/11. Although they found no evidence of abuse directly carried out by UK personnel, a key passage in the reports said then foreign secretary Jack Straw authorised MI6 for the cost of funding a plane which was involved in an individual rendition case, raising questions about the involvement of senior officials.\n\nCommittee chair Dominic Grieve said it was forced to end its investigation early because then Prime Minister Theresa May denied it access to key intelligence officials and witnesses. The committee decided to publish their findings in 2018 and called for the government to establish an inquiry into the matter \u201cwithout further delay.\u201d\n\nThe same year the British government officially apologised to a Libyan man, Abdul Hakim Belhaj, for the role MI6 played in kidnapping and renditioning him and his pregnant wife to Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s Libya in 2004. The couple were taken from Malaysia to Thailand, tied to the floor of a military transport and flown to Libya, where they were imprisoned \u2013 and Mr Belhaj, who was a known enemy of Gaddafi, was tortured.\n\nLetters from MI6 counter-terrorism head at the time, Sir Mark Allen, were found by Human Rights Watch in 2011 after Gaddafi\u2019s downfall and revealed the agency was involved.\n\n\u201cThis was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over the years \u2026 The intelligence about\u2026 [Belhaj] was British. I know I did not pay for the air cargo. But I feel I have the right to deal with you direct on this,\u201d a fax from Mr Allen said.\n\nOn 18 July, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington announced the government would not hold a judge-led inquiry into torture and rendition telling the House of Commons it has \u201cno legal obligation\u201d or \u201cpolicy reason\u201d to launch one. He added that the guidance and training for UK personnel dealing with detainees who are held by others has been revised.\n\nMr Melzer said the decision to rule out the inquiry is both illegal and a threat to the separation of powers because the government is dominating the other two branches of the state, the judiciary and Parliament over the torture investigation, which sets a dangerous precedent if unchallenged.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating absolute power,\u201d Melzer told The Independent.\n\n\u201cWe know \u2026 from history, a government that has unchecked power will abuse that power \u2026 we\u2019re allowing people to abuse their power and this can escalate to the worst. So we\u2019re clearly not there yet \u2026 But once we\u2019re there it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nThe UK Foreign Office (FCO) referred The Independent to the statement by Mr Lidington on 18 July which said, \u201cThe Government do not participate in, solicit, encourage or condone the use of torture or of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment ... To do so \u2026 would also be a betrayal of everything that we stand for as a nation.\n\n\u201cThere is no policy reason to\u2026 [hold an inquiry], given the extensive work already undertaken to improve policies and practices in this area. The Government\u2019s position is also that there is no legal obligation.\u201d\n\nKenneth Clarke, MP and co-chair of the all party parliamentary group (APPG) on extraordinary rendition, told The Independent it\u2019s a \u201ccover-up\u201d and senior officials are hiding in the \u201clong grass\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to reveal who took the decisions, what authorisation they have, what was the policy that led to us abandoning our normal prohibitions on being involved with torture or being involved with forceful rendition,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Clarke took a leading role setting up the present ISC with more powers and believes the government \u201cground it to a halt,\u201d because \u201cit was getting too far \u2026 exposing too much\u201d and was looking in depth into things that were \u201creally worrying\u201d including authorisation and motive. He has spoken to members of MI6 and the government about the need for an inquiry. One MI6 official whom Mr Clarke declined to name reportedly argued: \u201cWell it\u2019s all so long ago. It\u2019s all so different now. That doesn\u2019t happen like that now. It\u2019s all changed. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nOthers in government reportedly told him there have been too many public inquires and they cannot spend millions of pounds on another. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I think that\u2019s a cover-up,\u201d Mr Clarke said.\n\nLord Robin Hodgson, who works on the APPG for extraordinary rendition alongside Mr Clarke, said public interest in the issue has been worn out, adding the security services are using their \u201cace of trumps\u201d which is the argument that \u201cthis is keeping the country safe minister.\u201d\n\nFormer MI5 officer and whistleblower Annie Machon told The Independent she agreed it bore the hallmarks of a cover-up, adding the intelligence agencies have been \u201ccaught with their pants down.\u201d She said in the nineties MI5 had an \u201colder tribal knowledge\u201d from experience in Ireland that torture was counter-productive, produced blowback and was an unethical recruiting drum for terrorists, so they avoided it.\n\nBut after 9/11 the US went \u201chelter-skelter\u201d down the path of extraordinary renditions and extrajudicial killings and the UK agencies with their close working relationship quickly followed.\n\nThere was also tension among the British agencies, with the head of MI5 Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller pushing back against the use of torture, extraordinary rendition and war with Iraq arguing it was dangerous for national security while MI6 head Richard Dearlove was more willing to do what the Blair government wanted, she added.\n\nSenior officials have been protected while MI6 officers who might have come forward about torture and rendition during the Chilcot inquiry were not given a chance, Ms Machon added.\n\nShe believes the Belhaj case contains some of the most damning and disturbing evidence of UK involvement in torture and rendition after 9/11.\n\n\u201cI think because they\u2019ve been caught out now particularly with the Belhaj case\u2026 That has caused massive embarrassment,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo I would assume that both agencies have pulled back\u2026 again from the idea of ever being involved in torture.\u201d\n\nThe UN special rapporteur hasn\u2019t yet had a reply to his 19 August letter, which he said is unusual when dealing with the UK and the other \u201cmature democracies.\u201d\n\nThe Foreign Office told The Independent they still have time to reply before the deadline, adding that through the FCO\u2019s Magna Carta Fund for Human Rights and Democracy they have supported \u201cover \u00a3500,000 of programmes aimed at preventing torture around the world\u201d.", "description": "The UN has formally warned the UK its refusal to launch a judicial inquiry into torture and rendition breaches international law, The Independent can reveal. UN special rapporteur for torture Nils Melzer accused the British government of covering up its involvement in the practices post-9/ 11, saying he suspects a cover-up organised to protect figures who are \u201cvery high up\u201d.", "authors": ["Michael Selby-Green"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/10/30/18/Belhaj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
