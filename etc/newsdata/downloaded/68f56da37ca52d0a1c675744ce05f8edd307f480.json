In 2016, Trump won just 46 percent against Hillary Clinton and has consistently scored below 50 percent in national polls.\n\nA source familiar with Stack\u2019s thinking said, \u201cMr. Stack enjoys running Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and has no plans to run for any elected office.\u201d\n\nThe message testing told a different story. Those in the group were shown several short videos of other candidates including Biden, Warren and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz \u2014 a fellow billionaire who explored a presidential bid as an independent before announcing in September that he would not run \u2014 but viewed eight or nine videos that included Stack messaging, according to a focus group participant.\n\nThe focus group member, who presented paperwork to verify participation, declined to be named.\n\nAmong the questions posed to the roughly two dozen participants: \u201cWould you be open to voting for a third party candidate?\u201d\n\nNot all the feedback was positive for Stack, who is 64.\n\n\u201c[Focus group members] mentioned that if Biden\u2019s getting the criticism that he looked old, Ed Stack didn\u2019t look young either,\u201d the participant said, adding that some felt Stack \u201cdidn\u2019t have the charisma it would take to attract a coalition that you\u2019d need to have a chance as a third-party candidate.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\n\nThe session concluded with participants asked to vote on sample ballots that matched up Stack, Biden and Donald Trump and then Stack, Elizabeth Warren or Trump.\n\nStack has taken on a higher media profile in recent weeks, coinciding with the release of a new book, titled \u201cIt\u2019s How We Play the Game.\u201d This week, Stack took aim at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for failing to make headway on gun reform.\n\n\u201cI wish he\u2019d have the guts to bring it to a vote,\u201d Stack said.\n\nJoe Hunter, an adviser to Gary Johnson\u2019s Libertarian Party presidential bids in 2012 and 2016 said he has heard Stack\u2019s \u201cname come up\u201d in discussions about a possible run for president.\n\nBut he cautioned about the uphill battle of landing on state ballots for any third party candidate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s massive; all the structural, institutional barriers are really, really difficult \u2026 Absent having extraordinary resources, it would be difficult to put it together.\u201d\n\nBut Stack would begin with some advantages, including his personal wealth and the national attention he captured last year after announcing Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods would destroy $5 million of assault-style weapons and alter its gun sales policies in the wake of the Parkland high school shooting. Stack won accolades for his decision but also faced a backlash, including from the NRA.\n\nWhile Stack is testing as an independent candidate, he has been a major Republican donor. In 2012, he gave $100,000 to Restore Our Future, the super PAC backing Mitt Romney. He\u2019s also given $10,000 to the Pennsylvania Republican Committee and donated to various GOP members of Congress, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\n\nIn 2016, he drew the ire of the National Republican Congressional Committee after donating $300,000 to a super PAC supporting House Democrats \u2014 a donation he said at the time was aimed to benefit his sister, Kim Myers, who was running for Congress as a Democrat in New York.\n\n\u201cEdward Stack is funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars into Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Super PAC to fund his kid sister\u2019s campaign for Congress,\u201d the NRCC said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see that Stack is using the money he\u2019s made off of his family shipping jobs out of Upstate New York overseas to China to try buying Kim Myers a seat in Congress.\u201d\n\nAt a recent event to promote his new book, Stack referenced a meeting with Parkland parents.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I asked the parents from Parkland as we were leaving was, \u2018What is it that you would like me to do?\u2019 They said, \u2018We would like you to keep the conversation going,\u2019\u201d he said in Binghamton, N.Y., where he grew up. \u201cThat was a big watershed moment and we need to keep this conversation going. Which is one of the reasons I wrote the book. It talks about all the things you did to build the business to be in a position to be able to make these kinds of differences. One of the reasons to write the book was the commitment to those families to keep it going.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
