Brands.\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t tell someone you are going to charge them $5 in big bold print and then take it away with a fine print disclaimer,\u2019 said Douglas Schwartz, the couple\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s against the law.\u2019\n\nThe Estrellas \u2018sustained an ascertainable loss, in the form of time wasted driving to the subject Taco Bell, the gasoline expended to drive their vehicle to the subject Taco Bell, and in the amount of $2.18, which is the difference between what they should have been charged ($10.00 before taxes) and what they were charged ($12.18 before taxes),\u2019 according to the lawsuit.\n\nAlthough the lawsuit was initially filed in Middlesex County Superior Court in August, it was recently moved to federal court.\n\nThe Taco Bell commercial cited in the lawsuit shows a woman in a school library teaching young kids who are behaving rowdily.\n\nExasperated and needing a break, the woman says her solution is to head on over to Taco Bell and pay a $5 Chalupa Cravings Box.\n\nWhile the commercial does promote the meal as costing $5, there is a legal disclaimer at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe commercial they saw clearly offers the Chalupa Cravings Box for $5 each, but the fine print below (highlighted in yellow) states: 'At participating locations for a limited time. Prices may vary'\n\nThe disclaimer, which is in much smaller print, says \u2018prices may vary.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a classic bait and switch,\u2019 Schwartz said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s consumer fraud being perpetrated upon not only citizens of New Jersey, but all over the country.\n\n\u2018Taco Bell has reaped huge profits from their false, misleading and deceptive advertising.\u2019\n\nA spokesperson for Taco Bell told NJ Advance Media: \u2018Taco Bell and its franchisees are proud to provide millions of guests with delicious, affordable food every day.\n\n\u2018Our advertisements are truthful and accurate, and we will defend this case vigorously.\u2019\n\nOn Twitter, there wasn\u2019t much sympathy for the couple that filed the lawsuit.\n\n\u2018They are suing Taco Bell, which seems like a really good use of the legal system over two bucks and change,\u2019 tweeted Carol Roth\n\nAnother Twitter user tweeted: \u2018This got me... \u201cA dispute over $2.18 at Taco Bell literally has become a federal case.\u201d\u2019\n\nTweeted another Twitter user: 'What ever happened to \"Oh wait, I thought this was $5? It's not? Ok, never mind\u201d.\u2019\n\n\u2018Taco Bell's isn't that small, and fairly clear,\u2019 tweeted Gary A. Kline. \u2018Nice try on their part, but the couple should really be going after those ads advertising for occupational cancer lawyers - now there's some tiny print.\u2019\n\nTom Schultz tweeted: \u2018But there are the damages for infliction of emotional distress *just kidding*.\u2019\n\nJennifer Beightel tweeted: \u2018What attorney would even consider taking this case? WTAF?\u2019\n\n\u2018They are suing Taco Bell, which seems like a really good use of the legal system over two bucks and change,\u2019 tweeted Carol Roth.\n\nAnother Twitter user tweeted: \u2018This got me... \u201cA dispute over $2.18 at Taco Bell literally has become a federal case.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018Taco Bell's isn't that small, and fairly clear,\u2019 tweeted Gary A.
