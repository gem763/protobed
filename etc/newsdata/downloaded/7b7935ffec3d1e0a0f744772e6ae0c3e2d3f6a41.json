And white. I\u2019m \u201cbiracial.\u201d So was Frederick Douglass, the famed abolitionist.\n\nI was conceived in rape. So was Frederick Douglass.\n\nAs an adoptee and adoptive father, I fight for human dignity and for our God-given equality. So did Frederick Douglass.\n\nTo many on the Left, I don\u2019t exist. Black pro-lifers, apparently, don\u2019t exist. In fact, they think I should have been aborted.\n\nImagine the same if the inimitable Frederick Douglass were so easily discarded. The sin of racism\u2014in the form of the brutal institution of slavery\u2014would probably have continued to dehumanize and destroy for many more years.\n\nMainstream media refused to tell the truth about slavery during Douglass\u2019s time. He had to start his own newspaper, called the North Star, to do the job that so-called \u201cjournalists\u201d refused to do. Today, I\u2019m passionate about providing truth in my creative content and thoroughly researched articles, that\u2014like Douglass\u2014are fearless, factual and freeing. My columns are my North Star.\n\nMainstream media was fake news then and largely remains fake news now.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Washington Post can publish tripe like Marissa Brostoff\u2019s deranged \u201cHow white nationalists aligned with the antiabortion movement.\u201d They make yellow journalism look legit.\n\nEvery ludicrous charge of racism aimed at the Pro-life movement, which fights to save the lives of humans of every hue and ability, is pathetic projection. My wife and I, through the Radiance Foundation, regularly work with phenomenal people who run our nation\u2019s thousands of pregnancy help centers (thank you Heartbeat, CareNet and NIFLA) and maternity homes. We collaborate with incredible groups like Students for Life of America, Live Action, CURE, Alliance Defending Freedom, And Then There Were None, Dr. Alveda King\u2019s Civil Rights for the Unborn, Prolife Action League, Created Equal, March for Life, SBA List, Issues for Life Foundation, Heritage Foundation, Priests for Life, the Douglass Leadership Institute, and so many more that fight the dehumanization of the most vulnerable, regardless of level of melanin.\n\nYou won\u2019t find truth like William McGurn\u2019s Wall Street Journal article, \u201cWhite Supremacy and Abortion\u201d, in the rest of the leftist media. Other than WSJ and Fox News, there are no other major news outlets that will dare to challenge the pro-abortion Left\u2019s desperate and dishonest narratives. Of course, this is because the news media is the pro-abortion Left.\n\nAbortion is the leading killer of black lives in America outnumbering the top 15 causes of death\u2014combined. But we\u2019re supposed to celebrate this as some perverse form of justice? In fact, they have a name for it\u2014reproductive justice. So, when more black babies are aborted in NYC (the home of Planned Parenthood) than born alive, it\u2019s not racism; it\u2019s feminism. We\u2019re supposed to pretend that the reportedly ubiquitous \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d that allegedly stains every facet of American life doesn\u2019t apply to an industry, birthed in eugenic racism, which disproportionately kills black and brown lives?\n\nFannie Lou Hamer considered abortion to be genocide in the black community. She had no love for Planned Parenthood. In her speech, America is Sick and Man is on the Critical List, she says unambiguously: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the next thing that I don\u2019t buy. I don\u2019t buy distributing birth control pills and legalizing abortion, because they\u2019re talking about us! If you want to abortionize somebody, do it to yourself because I\u2019m going to try to keep the children.\u201d\n\nBut minority-led pro-abortion groups use her name to further their \u201creproductive justice\u201d charade. How do you use a pro-life woman, who was an adoptive mama, as a voice for the violence of abortion?\n\nDenial.\n\nProgressives depend on reinventing history and language to contort and distort. No matter the issue for the Left, confusion is a virtue and clarity is a vice.\n\nFailed presidential candidate, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, absurdly tried to compare pro-lifers to \u201cracists and anti-Semites\u201d. Keep in mind, as a Democrat, she\u2019s part of the party of slavery, Jim Crow, the KKK, poll taxes, literacy tests, and limitless abortion. The party continues to work ferociously to separate us by this made up social construct of race.\n\nWe\u2019re told we need to purge the public sphere of statues of \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d, while an emblem that is responsible for killing 247 black lives every single day is praised by the rabidly pro-abortion Left. Planned Parenthood kills more black lives in two weeks than the KKK killed in an entire century.\n\nSo, who exactly are the racists?\n\nImagine this. President Trump tweets these words: \u201cIf you\u2019re a Black woman in America, it\u2019s statistically safer to have an abortion than to carry a pregnancy to term or give birth.\u201d What kind of outcry would we hear if the president told black women they\u2019re better off having an abortionist kill their child? We would be barraged with around-the-clock gnashing of teeth and cries of \u201cwhite supremacy!\u201d and \u201cwhite nationalism!\u201d\n\nBut this tweet was actually posted by Planned Parenthood, the same group that is suing\u2014along with the ACLU\u2014the state of Georgia to protect black genocide. Nearly 61% of all abortions in the state kill black babies. Planned Parenthood in Georgia doesn\u2019t offer prenatal care, parenting classes or material assistance for poor mothers, but they do offer plenty of fake health in the form of abortion.\n\nYet pro-abortion celebrities are banding together with the nation\u2019s largest abortion business because killing less black human beings is raaaaaaacist.\n\nHere\u2019s my definition of systemic racism: \u201cA government-funded entity that disproportionately kills black lives.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Planned Parenthood with its half-a-billion-a-year in taxpayer funding.\n\n\u201cI would guess that the abortionists have done more to get rid of generations and cripple others than all of the years of slavery and lynchings.\u201d Those words are from Dr. Mildred Jefferson, co-founder of the National Right to Life. Oh, and she was black.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll continue to fight alongside my red, yellow, black and brown pro-life brothers and sisters to end the violence against the most defenseless, most vulnerable, and most marginalized human beings on the planet\u2014the unborn. We are today\u2019s abolitionists.", "description": "I\u2019m black. And white.
