The white metal was on pace for a weekly gain of 3.8%, which would represent its sharpest such rise since the period ended Aug. 30.\n\nInvestors await the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decision at a two-day gathering on Oct. 29-30, with traders expecting the U.S. central bank to deliver its third quarter percentage point interest cut of the year. However, it isn\u2019t clear if the Fed will conform to high market hopes and ease policy further.\n\nAnother factor that has added some support for bullion and precious metals has been Brexit. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would seek a general election in Dec. 12 to break a Brexit deadlock, but it is uncertain if he can win Parliament\u2019s support for the vote, which could raise the chances of a disorderly exit from Europe\u2019s trade bloc.\n\nInvestors say those uncertainties in the market as well as other demand factors may help bullion mount a breakthrough after a lackluster stretch.\n\n\u201cThe recent rebound was also important from a technical point of view, as this recovery is breaking up the negative trendline of the past few weeks. The key level of $1,500 is now a support, while the first resistance level is placed at $1,520,\u201d wrote Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, in a Friday note.\n\nSeasonal factors also have been cited as a boost for gold, with commodity experts saying that the India holiday of Diwali, where gold buying tends to increase, could deliver a fillip to futures.\n\n\u201cGold recovered to $1,500 just in time for the long weekend of Diwali celebrations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRounding out trading in other Comex metals, December copper HGZ19, +0.64% added 0.2% to $2.6726 a pound, with prices up about 1.4% for the week.\n\nJanuary platinum PLF20, +0.76% traded at $938.30 an ounce, up 1.4% for the session, poised for a weekly rise of 4.6%. December palladium PAZ19, +0.01% fell by 0.3% to $1,743 an ounce, paring its weekly rise to around 1.5%.", "description": "Gold futures extend their gain above a key $1,500 price on Friday, and look poised to settle at a one-month high, as investors positioned for more easing...", "authors": ["Myra P.
