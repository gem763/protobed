Olivia died a few weeks later. The cause of death was attributed to intestinal failure.\n\nBut after the exhumation of Olivia's body last year, an autopsy revealed no evidence of the illness or the other symptoms claimed by Ms Turner. The cause of her death is now listed as undetermined.\n\nDoctors became suspicious last year when Ms Turner brought her older daughter in with complaints of \"bone pain\", prompting the investigation into Olivia's death.\n\nThe investigation revealed a pattern of doctors telling Ms Turner that Olivia did not have a terminal condition and that she should not end medical care.\n\nMs Turner is accused of soliciting donations, government aid and services from charitable organisations that helped grant dream wishes to her daughter - like becoming a firefighter for a day and throwing a costume party.", "description": "In the months before her death, her daughter completed items on her \"bucket list\" of dreams.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14D87/production/_109338358_kellyreneeturner.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
