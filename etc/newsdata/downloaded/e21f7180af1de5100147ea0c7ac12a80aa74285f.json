Sulzberger said that the paper would not be intimidated by those trying to undermine their reporting but urged employees to be more vigilant about what they say in public outside of written articles.\n\n\u201cIf anyone\u2014even those acting in bad faith\u2014brings legitimate problems to our attention, we\u2019ll look into them and respond appropriately,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is imperative that all of us remain thoughtful about how our words and actions reflect on the Times, particularly during this period of sustained pressure and scrutiny. We all play a part in upholding our commitment to give the news impartially without fear or favor.\u201d\n\nThe memo was a reaction to just the latest social-media controversy involving the newspaper of record: pro-Trump outlet Breitbart News resurfaced Times senior staff editor Tom Wright-Piersanti\u2019s decade-old tweets that included insensitive anti-Semitic comments. He apologized for the posts.\n\nSeveral days later, the Times published a story about an infamous group of pro-Trump GOP operatives who have worked behind-the-scenes to dig up old, offensive social-media posts of journalists at news outlets deemed the \u201copposition\u201d to President Trump.\n\nThe memo and article both alarmed Times staffers, spurring many to take precautions to protect themselves. \u201cI think people are being more cautious, I know people are locking down their accounts,\u201d one Times staffer told The Daily Beast.\n\nAnd while there is no official edict or documented strategy, many editors have urged staffers to be hyper-vigilant about their social-media behavior.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a full-on issue now that even management is grappling with,\u201d another Times employee said. \u201cEveryone senses a need to come up with a plan to handle journalists\u2019 social-media history, especially if this is going to be an ongoing problem.\u201d\n\nOver the past several weeks, the paper has been roiled by a number of embarrassing social-media headaches.\n\nNew York Times deputy Washington editor Jonathan Weisman was demoted after two Twitter incidents: In one tweet, he flippantly dismissed the notion that Democratic congresswomen of color Rashida Tlaib, of Detroit, and Ilhan Omar, of Minneapolis, accurately represent the Midwest, and that civil-rights icon Rep. John Lewis, of Atlanta, represents the Deep South; and in response to critical tweets on the matter from author Roxane Gay, Weisman emailed her, her assistant, and her publisher demanding an \u201cenormous apology.\u201d\n\nAnd then earlier this week, conservative opinion writer Bret Stephens threatened a George Washington University professor who jokingly called him a \u201cbedbug\u201d on Twitter by emailing him (along with the school\u2019s provost) and challenging him to \u201ccome to my home, meet my wife and kids, talk to us for a few minutes, and then call me a \u2018bedbug\u2019 to my face.\u201d The disproportionate response to an otherwise obscure tweet was broadly criticized online and the columnist ultimately quit Twitter as a result.\n\nBoth Twitter-based mishaps were widely mocked both inside and outside the Times building in a manner that echoed concerns of the paper\u2019s top editor.\n\nDuring a town-hall meeting with staff earlier this month, executive editor Dean Baquet expressed displeasure at the way social-media outrages had affected company morale, saying it was \u201cpainful\u201d and destabilizing to see staffers fight or subtweet each other on Twitter. He also suggested that he was open to instituting new rules in order to keep disputes between Times employees off the social-media platform.\n\n\u201cI think we should tighten the rules a little, which always upsets people a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were tweets that people at the New York Times retweeted or liked last week that were really painful for this newsroom and for me personally. So I\u2019m gonna keep saying that, and maybe we should talk about the rules, too.\u201d\n\nThe paper has operated under fairly strict but straightforward social-media guidelines, which it released publicly in 2017. The rules are primarily designed to \u201cavoid expressing partisan opinions or editorializing on issues that The Times is covering,\u201d and include restricting reporters from mocking readers or making \u201coffensive comments.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the barrage of recent incidents on social media have left many in the organization fatigued.\n\nMultiple staffers expressed ambivalence and frustration about the onslaught of outside interest in paper\u2019s internal affairs. When asked about the mood inside the newsroom following Stephens\u2019 recent blunder, one staffer quipped: \u201cI\u2019m so sick of talking about this shit.\u201d\n\n\u2014Lachlan Cartwright contributed reporting.", "description": "After a series of online missteps, the paper of record\u2019s publisher urged staffers to be more vigilant about their behavior on social media.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3642,w_6475,x_0,y_188/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567184561/GettyImages-986450122_lswwkf"}
