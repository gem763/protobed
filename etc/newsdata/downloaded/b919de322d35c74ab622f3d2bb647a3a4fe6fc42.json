China accuses foreign parties in the U.S. and elsewhere of encouraging the demonstrations.\n\nMorey\u2019s now-deleted tweet read: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHouston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta attempted to distance the team from Morey\u2019s tweet with a Twitter post of his own: \u201cListen.@darylmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s relationship with the Rockets has been especially close because Chinese hall of famer Yao Ming played his entire NBA career with the team.", "description": "China\u2019s official basketball association says it will suspend cooperation with the Houston Rockets following a tweet by the team\u2019s general manager in support...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS738_morey1_ZG_20191006181322.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
