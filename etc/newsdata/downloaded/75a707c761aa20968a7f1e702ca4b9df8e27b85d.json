Only four of the 13 recovered bodies have been identified by surviving family members, including that of a 12-year-old girl.\n\nAccording to an initial reconstruction of events, all the people on board moved to one end of the vessel as the rescue boat arrived, causing it to overturn. The boat, carrying mostly people from sub-Saharan African, had initially left Libya before sailing along the coast to reach the city of Sfax, in Tunisia, where another 15 people boarded before they continued their journey to Sicily, according to survivors.\n\nSicilian prosecutors from Agrigento who are investigating the shipwreck emphasise that, for some time now, the route from Tunisia has been increasingly favoured by refugees and migrants attempting to reach Europe.\n\n\u201cPeople are leaving from Libya less and less and as a result the vast majority of migrants come from Tunisia,\u201d the Agrigento prosecutor, Salvatore Vella, said.\n\nAbout 2,500 people have arrived in Italy by sea from north Africa in September, and almost all of them left from Tunisia, usually from the coastal city of Zarzis. The arrivals by sea to Italy in September represent a third of the 7,637 who landed since the start of the year, according to data from the Interior Ministry.\n\nThe Tunisia route, though shorter than from Libya, can however be more risky. \u201cThe goal for those departing from Tunisia is to reach the Sicilian coast directly and evade controls,\u201d said Vella. \u201cThis means that migrants do not launch an SOS as has happened from those leaving Libya. This, of course, makes the journey more dangerous.\u201d\n\nThey are called \u201cphantom landings\u201d and for some years now they have been an increasingly common way of travelling with boats, upon landing, often abandoned on Sicilian beaches.\n\nMeanwhile in Brussels, Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos urged member states to back a temporary plan to quickly get migrants off boats in the Mediterranean Sea and distribute them among willing countries. Germany, France, Italy and Malta are seeking approval from their EU partners for a \u201cfast-track\u201d process to screen migrants, relocate asylum-seekers and return people who do not qualify for asylum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a moment for all member states to show more solidarity and more responsibility,\u201d Avramopoulos told reporters in Luxembourg, \u201cWe cannot continue like this with what is happening in the Mediterranean. We need permanent mechanisms,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 27 ministers \u2013 minus the UK - were also confronted with a stark warning that the eastern Mediterranean shows signs of an \u201cemerging crisis\u201d, following a rise in people seeking asylum.\n\nGreece, Bulgaria and Cyprus - three countries facing increased numbers of asylum seekers arriving via sea and land from Turkey \u2013 issued a joint paper that said: \u201cAlthough the current situation is different from the crisis of 2015-early 2016, it contains alarming elements of an emerging crisis. Europe cannot be caught unprepared for a second time.\u201d\n\nThe three nations urge the EU to devote more funds to migration in its next seven-year budget to help them manage the flow of people.\n\nSeparately, a leaked document from the European commission revealed that Greece was seeing the highest number of weekly arrivals since spring 2016, when a controversial EU-Turkey deal took effect. In March 2016, the EU promised to pay \u20ac6bn to refugee charities in Turkey, if Ankara took action to prevent people getting on people smugglers\u2019 boats.\n\nNumbers fell dramatically, but have risen sharply in 2019: in August almost 8,000 asylum seekers arrived in Greece over the sea, compared with around 5,000 in July. Greece is also facing a sharp increase in asylum seekers travelling over its land border with Turkey, with arrivals more than doubling to 1,500 in August (compared with the previous month). Around three-quarters of people using the land route are Turkish nationals.\n\nOver 1 million migrants arrived in the EU in 2015, most of them from Syria or Iraq, sparking one of Europe\u2019s biggest political crises in recent times as nations bickered over who should take responsibility for them.\n\n\u201cA strong agreement will help save lives and demonstrate that EU countries are committed to working together to uphold basic values and international obligations,\u201d said Amnesty migration researcher, Matteo de Bellis.\n\nSince 2013, almost 20,000 migrants have died trying to reach Europe.", "description": "The vessel carrying people from sub-Saharan Africa met with rough seas near the island of Lampadusa", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/3072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ea780a649050930d9e9e1de81345f77c", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
