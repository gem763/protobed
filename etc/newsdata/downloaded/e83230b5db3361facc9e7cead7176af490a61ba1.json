Massie Introduces Bill to Abolish Federal Department of Education\n\n\u200b\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Today, Representative Thomas Massie introduced H.R. 899, a bill to abolish the federal Department of Education. The bill, which is one sentence long, states, \u201cThe Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2018.\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\nOn the day of Betsy DeVos\u2019 scheduled Senate confirmation for Secretary of Education, Massie said, \u201cNeither Congress nor the President, through his appointees, has the constitutional authority to dictate how and what our children must learn.\"\n\nMassie added, \"Unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. should not be in charge of our children\u2019s intellectual and moral development. States and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students. Schools should be accountable. Parents have the right to choose the most appropriate educational opportunity for their children, including home school, public school, or private school.\"\n\n\u201cFor years, I have advocated returning education policy to where it belongs - the state and local level,\u201d said Rep. Walter Jones, an original co-sponsor. \u201cD.C. bureaucrats cannot begin to understand the needs of schools and its students on an individual basis. It is time that we get the feds out of the classroom, and terminate the Department of Education.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a proponent of empowering parents, teachers and local school boards who best know our children and their needs,\" said Rep. Raul Labrador, another original co-sponsor. \"Eliminating the U.S. Department of Education is the most important step we in Congress can take in returning decision making to the local level.\u201d\n\n\"Education of our students should lie primarily with parents, teachers, and state and local officials who know how to meet their individual needs best,\" said freshman Rep. Andy Biggs. \"Since its inception, the Department of Education has grown into an unrecognizable federal beast, and its policies have helped foster Common Core across the country. It is time the one-size-fits-all approach by the federal government is ended and authority is returned to the local level.\"\n\nThe Department of Education began operating in 1980. On September 24, 1981 in his Address to the Nation on the Program for Economic Recovery, President Ronald Reagan said, \u201cAs a third step, we propose to dismantle two Cabinet Departments, Energy and Education. Both Secretaries are wholly in accord with this. Some of the activities in both of these departments will, of course, be continued either independently or in other areas of government. There's only one way to shrink the size and cost of big government, and that is by eliminating agencies that are not needed and are getting in the way of a solution. Now, we don't need an Energy Department to solve our basic energy problem. As long as we let the forces of the marketplace work without undue interference, the ingenuity of consumers, business, producers, and inventors will do that for us. Similarly, education is the principal responsibility of local school systems, teachers, parents, citizen boards, and State governments. By eliminating the Department of Education less than 2 years after it was created, we cannot only reduce the budget but ensure that local needs and preferences, rather than the wishes of Washington, determine the education of our children.\u201d\n\nOriginal co-sponsors include Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA), Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC), and Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID).\n\n###", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Today, Representative Thomas Massie introduced H.R. 899, a bill to abolish the federal Department of Education.
