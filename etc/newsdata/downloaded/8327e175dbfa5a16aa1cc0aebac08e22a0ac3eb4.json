They described Google searches for CBD as now reaching the numbers for yoga and e-cigarettes.\n\nBut what is CBD, and is the hype actually real? Let\u2019s have a look.\n\nWhat is a Cannabinoid?\n\nThere are three types of cannabinoids. Endocannabinoids, which are produced naturally in the body; man-made cannabinoids, which can be really dangerous; and the most popular, cannabinoids such as THC and CBD, which come from the marijuana plant.\n\n(MORE: Self-styled 'weed nuns' put faith in the healing powers, and profits, of cannabis)\n\nAll three kinds of cannabinoids bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body. CB1 receptors, located primarily in the brain, are believed to control mood, memory, sleep, appetite and pain. CB2 receptors are located in parts of the body that produce blood cells, such as the spleen, and are believed to affect inflammation.\n\nWhat is CBD?\n\nCBD is short for cannabidiol, and it\u2019s one chemical compound found in the Cannabis sativa plant \u2014 in both marijuana and hemp. CBD differs from THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) because it doesn\u2019t cause the intoxicating, euphoric \u201chigh\u201d associated with marijuana.\n\nWhat are the health benefits?\n\nThough there are claims of health benefits wherever you go, the science isn\u2019t quite there yet \u2014 most of the research that has found benefits was done on animals. That\u2019s because researching marijuana legally is difficult. Marijuana is a schedule I controlled substance, defined as having \u201cno accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s a lot of anecdotal evidence. One case: Charlotte Figi.\n\nA robust and active toddler, Charlotte began having seizures early in life \u2014 up to 50 per day. She was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome, a seizure disorder that can be uncontrollable with typical medications. After exhaustive research, Charlotte\u2019s mother found that the best treatment was a combination of CBD extract with Charlotte\u2019s normal antiepileptic drug regimen. This cut the seizures down to two to three per month, allowing her to live a normal childhood.\n\n(MORE: Marijuana company heads to New York Stock Exchange)\n\nIn June 2018, the FDA approved a CBD-containing seizure medication called Epidiolex, which can be used for the uncontrollable seizures caused by diseases such as Dravet Syndrome.\n\nCBD is also widely used to treat pain and anxiety. Scientists are quick to say they are still unsure of the way this works, but they believe it may be due to CBD altering some brain pathways linked to these symptoms.\n\nIn skin care, CBD has been reported to treat itchiness, acne and allergic dermatitis \u2014 a skin reaction to allergies. While the mechanisms here are also unknown, scientists think it may be due to cannabinoid receptors in the skin which, when activated, work to reduce inflammation.\n\nAs states move to legalize these compounds to the public, all of these claims will need to be studied.\n\nPHOTO: Oils containing CBD (Cannabidiol) are seen in a shop in Paris, June 14, 2018. (AFP/Getty Images) More\n\nHow do people use CBD?\n\nMany CBD products are sold as oils or balms, but they are also available in lotions, facial serums, lozenges or as part of cocktails. Although manufacturers claim there is an appropriate dose for the products they make, that is up for debate. The nutrition and supplement business, in general, is highly unregulated and this includes CBD products, even in states with legal marijuana.", "description": "The non-hallucinogenic marijuana plant extract is found in everything from skin creams to dog treats, all with claims of miracle-like results.
