Mr. Huff said it was an homage to the video game Mortal Kombat and the rope is supposed to represent Mr. Obama\u2019s spine.\n\nThe scarecrow was also featured stepping on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s head.\n\nThe display had been up for three weeks as part of the village\u2019s scarecrow decorating contest, but went viral after resident Kathy DeTroyer posted it on Facebook Thursday.\n\n\u201cHow is this ok? I am disgusted this is in my hometown. Way to display your ignorance. Democrat or Republican this is just wrong,\u201d she wrote.\n\nQuality Coatings has not publicly addressed the backlash, which has since led to 40 negative Facebook reviews. They have since replaced the display with a yellow tape sash that reads \u201cPC-POLICE.\u201d\n\nDespite the display, Mr. Huff said he didn\u2019t vote in 2016 and doesn\u2019t favor any candidate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t support anyone. I\u2019ve never voted for anyone other than myself,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
