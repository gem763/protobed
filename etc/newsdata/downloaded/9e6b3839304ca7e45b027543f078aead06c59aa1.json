This simplified version calls for chicken pieces and a standard grill. The original recipe is a trade secret, but you can find many slightly different variations on the internet, typically including ginger, garlic, soy sauce, something sweet (honey, brown sugar or maple syrup) and something acidic (vinegar, white wine, lime juice or pineapple juice). This recipe is adapted from \u201cAloha Kitchen: Recipes from Hawai\u2018i\u201d by Alana Kysar (Ten Speed, March 2019). It also works beautifully with boneless chicken thighs, but adjust your cooking time accordingly.\n\nLearn: How to Grill", "description": "In 1955, Ernest Morgado, a Honolulu businessman, served a group of farmers grilled chicken that had been marinated in his mother\u2019s teriyaki-style sauce It was such a hit that he decided to market it with the name \u201chuli huli.\u201d Huli means \u201cturn\u201d in Hawaiian and refers to how it\u2019s prepared: grilled between two racks and turned halfway through cooking This simplified version calls for chicken pieces and a standard grill", "authors": ["Margaux Laskey", "Samin Nosrat", "Ali Slagle", "Julia Moskin", "Melissa Clark", "Sam Sifton", "Claire Saffitz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/17/dining/ml-hulihuli-chicken/ml-hulihuli-chicken-articleLarge.jpg"}
