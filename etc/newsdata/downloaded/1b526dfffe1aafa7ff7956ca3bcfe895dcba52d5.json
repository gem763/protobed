For some women this saw their state pension age jump from 60 to 66 at relatively short notice.\n\nBut after a judicial review of the Government's decision, a case brought by Julie Delve and Karen Glynn with campaign group BackTo60 was dismissed.\n\nWe explain what has happened to women's state pension age (and how it is rising for men too), the issues raised by the case, and what happens now.\n\nState pension age: Campaigners outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, after they lost their High Court fight against the Government\n\nWhat changes are under way to women's and men's state pension age - and why is it controversial?\n\nBoth men and women's state pension ages are currently in the process of increasing to 66. And between 2026 and 2028, they will both rise again to 67.\n\nThe next rise to 68 will happen between 2037 and 2039, after the Government accepted the recommendation of ex-Confederation of British Industry boss John Cridland, who carried out an official review of future state pension age increases.\n\nThe changes to the state pension age are aimed at bringing women's state pension age into line with men's, and taking account of everyone living longer.\n\nBut the rise in women's state pension age became contentious because in 2011 Chancellor George Osborne brought forward the timing of changes, initially for women alone and then also for both genders.\n\nThis hit women particularly hard because their increases happen both sooner than expected and in quick succession. Some 2.6million women got just five years' notice of an extension to their pension age.\n\nThis left them forced to either work much longer than expected or to retire with no state pension for that period and with not enough time to build up savings that could bridge the gap.\n\nHow steep are state pension rises for women and men?\n\nAge increases: The graph illustrates how swiftly the age change kicked in for women (Source: LCP)\n\nWhat is the campaign about?\n\nThe Women Against State Pension Inequality - or WASPI - campaign says it agrees with equalising women's and men's pension ages, but not the 'unfair' way the changes are being implemented and the lack of communication to women about changes which would have a major - and in some cases devastating - impact on their future finances.\n\nThe judicial review was the result of efforts by a different women's campaign group, BackTo60.\n\nTwo claimants argued that raising their pension age discriminated against them on the grounds of their age and their sex, and that they were not properly informed of the changes in time to adjust.\n\nWhat did the judges say today?\n\nLord Justice Irwin and Mrs Justice Whipple dismissed the claim against the Government decision to raise women's state pension age, saying: 'The court was saddened by the stories contained in the claimants' evidence.\n\n'But the court's role was limited. There was no basis for concluding that the policy choices reflected in the legislation were not open to Government. In any event they were approved by Parliament.\n\n'The wider issues raised by the claimants about whether the choices were right or wrong or good or bad were not for the court. They were for members of the public and their elected representatives.'\n\nTwo claimants - Julie Delve, 61, and Karen Glynn, 63 - took the Department for Work and Pensions to court, arguing that raising their pension age 'unlawfully discriminated against them on the grounds of age, sex, and age and sex combined'.\n\nThe pair, supported by Backto60, also claimed they were not given adequate notice in order to be able to adjust to the changes.\n\nBut the judges said: 'There was no direct discrimination on grounds of sex, because this legislation does not treat women less favourably than men in law.\n\n'Rather it equalises a historic asymmetry between men and women and thereby corrects historic direct discrimination against men.'\n\nThe court also rejected the claimants' argument that the policy was discriminatory based on age, adding that even if it was 'it could be justified on the facts'.\n\nWhat will happen now to women?\n\nThousands of complaints about the Government's decision in 2011 to hasten the age hikes for women, and failures to notify them over the years, have been piling up at its door - but these were on hold until after the judicial review.\n\nWomen have lodged formal protests about maladministration in the way changes to the state pension age were made\n\nMaking a complaint is a convoluted process that involves writing first to the Department for Work and Pensions, then the Independent Case Examiner\u2019s Office, and finally to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.\n\nThe WASPI campaign has a guide to doing this here.\n\nThe group said the High Court could not make a judgement on maladministration because that is the role of the PHSO.\n\nIt expects that there will be a period of consideration from the DWP and the PHSO about how to proceed.\n\nDemonstration: Anne Taylor (left) and Patsy Franklin from the BackTo60 campaign outside the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, at the start of the legal case\n\nWhat does the Government say?\n\nA Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: 'We welcome the High Court\u2019s judgment. It has always been our view that the changes we made to women\u2019s state pension age were entirely lawful and did not discriminate on any grounds.\n\n'The court decided that arguments the claimants were not given adequate notice of changes to the state pension age could not be upheld.\n\n'This follows the extensive communications that DWP made to publicise these changes over many years.\n\n'The government decided in 1995 that it was going to make the state pension age the same for men and women as a long-overdue move towards gender equality. Raising state pension age in line with life expectancy changes has been the policy of successive administrations over many years.'\n\nHow did government communicate changes to women? Money Mail looked into how the Government advertised the state pension age rise to women in a recent investigation. The first official awareness campaign in 1998 was designed around the board game Monopoly, and warned readers not to leave their pension 'to chance', it found. But Money Mail said the strangest attempt at informing women was a \u00a310million 'Working Dogs' campaign launched in 2001. Former Pensions Minister Ros Altmann questioned how the Government expected women to have a clue that an advert where two dogs are talking to each other has anything to do with her, let alone her state pension David Alder, a lecturer in advertising at Bournemouth University, said: 'A ludicrously inappropriate and probably offensive central metaphor makes this ad an automatic page-turner.'\n\nWhen can I get my state pension?\n\nThe state pension age rises that are due to step up over the next decades mean that workers will be able to retire at different ages dependent upon when they were born. The closer they are to retirement, the less likely the current projections will change dramatically for them.\n\nSomeone who is 50 now should get their state pension at the age of 67, whereas someone who is 40 now should get it at the age of 68.\n\nAs it stands a 30-year-old and 20-year-old are also due to get their state pension at the age of 68, however, the level is still under review and it is highly likely this will change.\n\n> Guide: State pension age - when can you retire?\n\nHow much do you need to save into a pension? We are regularly told that we aren\u2019t saving enough into our pensions, but how much is enough? A recent report claimed that while auto enrolment has dragged more people into saving for retirement, it has also lulled them into a false sense of security. Currently, the system means 8 per cent of a worker\u2019s salary must be going into a pension \u2013 unless they opt out \u2013 but that includes their contribution, basic rate tax relief and what their employer puts in. Experts say that's not enough and that depending on when you start that number needs to be more like a minimum of 12 per cent or even 15 per cent. On this podcast Simon Lambert and Georgie Frost dive into the world of pension saving and the tricks you can use to get more going into your retirement pot.

Well, where will the Government go from here is the better question.\n\nRegarding Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge during the Tory leadership campaign to look at the state pension age issue with 'fresh vigour', she added: 'We will be holding you to that undertaking.'\n\nShe told supporters: There is no doubt whatsoever that this is discrimination.'\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott tweeted: 'Disappointed to hear about today's decision regarding the WASPI women. I will continue to support the @WASPI-Campaign in their fight against pension inequality.'\n\nFormer Green Party leader, and their only MP, Caroline Lucas, tweeted: 'Deeply disappointing that the courageous and unjustly treated WASPI women have lost their judicial review in the High Court. The gross pensions injustice for 1950s women remains - I will continue to support their fight.'\n\nUnison general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'This is a terrible blow for the millions of women who will have been hoping for a very different outcome today.\n\n'The decision to hike the state pension age with next to no notice didn't just throw their retirement plans up in the air, it also left many women on lower incomes really struggling to make ends meet.\n\n'It seems perverse that the Department for Work and Pensions had no obligation to inform these women of this significant change. But despite today's decision women born in the 1950s will not give up their campaign to get back what they are rightly owed.'\n\nWhat do pension experts say?\n\nDavid Everett, LCP partner and head of pensions research, says: 'Whatever the rights and wrongs of this case, there is little doubt that many 1950s-born women were unaware and unprepared for what for some is a substantial increase in the age at which they can draw their State Pension.\n\n'There are two hindsight lessons to draw from this. First, there could have been far better communication, targeted at those most affected, when the changes to the state pension were made \u2013 and any such communication should have been ongoing;\n\n'Second, the transition ought to have been gentler so that the shock was less for those caught unaware.\n\n'The state pension is a big thing. It is the bedrock of retirement income and for many is by far the biggest element of their retirement provision. So changes to it and particularly to when it starts have to be communicated carefully and effectively.\n\n'But when you \"join\" this pension scheme on turning 16, no-one informs you of this fact. As you build up your NI record, no-one tells you how you are doing.\n\n'In fact, you have absolutely no idea about your state pension entitlement until you get close to state pension age by which time it is too late.\n\n'This is in contrast with the disclosures that successive Governments have rightly required occupational pension schemes to make to their members.'\n\nSteven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said: 'If starting with a blank sheet of paper, very few people would argue that males and females should be treated differently, whether in terms of pay or in this case state pensions.\n\n'The problem is whenever changes are implemented to address an inequality, one party tends to be \"disadvantaged\" by the change, relative to the other.\n\n'The millions of women affected by the increase in state pension age have had to face a significant change to their lives and retirement aspirations.\n\n'For such a huge change, there needs to be very clear, timely and personalised communications and clearly there were failings here.\n\n'But had the state pension age for women not been brought into line with that for men and indeed the common age increased further as is now happening, at a time when we are on average living longer, it would have placed a massive and unsustainable extra burden on the working age population, whose National Insurance contributions pay today\u2019s state pensions.'\n\nTom McPhail, head of policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'The Government will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief at this judgement, as any financial remedy would have cost them many billions of pounds to deliver.\n\n'Given most of the women involved are now already past their revised state pension age, it is hard to see where the campaign will go from here.\n\n'It is axiomatic that retirement ages have to rise. It is simply not possible to offset the combination of longer life expectancy, stagnant wages and low interest rates, without working longer and retiring for less time.\n\n'The critical learning point from this court judgement is people need to prepare for retirement well in advance. It was this disconnect between these women\u2019s expectations and their impending reality check of a later state pension, which has resulted in the lawyers getting involved.'\n\nTom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell, said: 'This ruling will come as a bitter blow to the millions of women who had been hoping the courts would roll back the tide on state pension age increases.\n\n'The financial impact of having to wait up to six more years to receive the state pension is significant and for many just scraping by it has pushed them into serious financial hardship.\n\n'While some of these stories are heart-breaking, increases in the state pension age have been a long time coming and are deemed necessary to ensure the costs borne by younger taxpayers don\u2019t spiral out of control.'\n\nHelen Morrissey, pension specialist at Royal London, said: 'Today\u2019s judgement may well have gone in the Government\u2019s favour but there are lessons they must learn from this.\n\n'While the judges said the increases were not discriminatory and they were not in a position to conclude steps taken to inform these women were reasonable there is no question that women have experienced severe financial hardship as a result of this change.\n\n'Government must ensure such changes are communicated more effectively in future.'", "description": "After a judicial review, a case brought by campaign group BackTo60 was dismissed.
