Why You Should Care About the Difference", "language": "en", "text": "The United States is on recession watch as market signals flash red. Manufacturing is straining under President Trump\u2019s trade war, business investment is slowing and consumer confidence is showing cracks.\n\nBut many economists expect that growth will weaken slightly over the next couple of years \u2014 without actually contracting \u2014 and that distinction is crucial. The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, said last week that \u201cthe most likely outlook for our economy remains a favorable one with moderate growth,\u201d and \u201cour main expectation is not at all that there will be a recession.\u201d\n\nEconomic growth that dips substantially lower can hurt, especially for workers in hard-hit industries. But the aftermath of weak growth has historically differed pretty sharply from the fallout caused by an all-out recession. Here is a rundown of the differences, and why they could matter to your job and bank account.\n\nWhat is a recession, and who decides?\n\nWhile economic growth has moderated only slightly so far, forecasters think America is headed for a deeper pullback. The economy expanded by 2.9 percent in 2018, and economist s expect that pace to slow to 2.3 percent in 2019 before falling to 1.8 percent next year, based on the median in a survey by Bloomberg. Several particularly glum forecasters even expect the economy to shrink for one or two quarters in 2020.", "description": "The economy seems to be cooling off.
