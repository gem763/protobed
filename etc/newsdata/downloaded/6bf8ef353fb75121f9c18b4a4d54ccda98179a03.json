The iconic goalposts are then erected while staff paint the distances on the grass from one end to the other.\n\nThe NFL pitch at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is installed using state-of-the-art technology\n\nThe time-lapse video begins with the standard football pitch at the Tottenham Hotspur ground\n\nThe pitch then retracts sitting in three pitch-long steel sections which slide out simultaneously\n\nThe final product: the NFL pitch is ready for Sunday's match between the Bears and Raiders\n\nThe grass field used for Tottenham games is retractable, with an artificial turf used for NFL underneath.\n\nFrom start to finish, it takes 25 minutes to retract the pitch and there are 99 steel trays joined together to make up the sliding pitch.\n\nThe grass pitch sits in three pitch-long steel sections, weighing more than 3,000 tonnes each.\n\nSections slide out simultaneously, before moving laterally to create the seamless surface.\n\nThe scoring zones are then measured out with Oakland etched into the turf and coloured in with white paint, with the rest of the zone painted black. A practice run of the stadium's light show then takes place as the hours before kick off trickle away.\n\nThe end zones are then painted to read 'Oakland Raiders' with the background painted black\n\nFans slowly begin to fill the multi-purpose arena as the London Series opener was approaching\n\nThe floodlights turn on and the ground staff come out for the pre-match entertainment\n\nThe flags of the United States and Great Britain are displayed before the game begins\n\nThe transformation is almost complete!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd1c \ud83c\udfc8 coming to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium! #NFLUK pic.twitter.com/H9NVNIvdmn \u2014 NFL UK (@NFLUK) October 4, 2019\n\nGame day arrives and the timelapse shows the stadium begin to fill with fans ahead of the London Series opener. As the sun sets, the arena is at full capacity with the flags of the United States and Great Britain displayed on the turf moments before the game begins.\n\nThe flags are then whisked away off the field and the timelapse comes to an end as the game gets underway.\n\nIt's the first time the new stadium has hosted the NFL since it opened late last season, with the venue long planned to cater for the two sports.\n\nThe 60,000-capacity stadium hosted the opening game of the London Series between Oakland Raiders and the Chicago Bears, with the Raiders running out 24-21 winners after Josh Jacobs scored the crucial touchdown to separate the sides.\n\nDue to the innovative technology used to change the pitch, no lasting damage will be done and Spurs will be able to play Watford once the international break reaches its conclusion.", "description": "The timelapse begins at the finale of Spurs' humiliating loss to Bayern Munich and runs through the course of several days as the pitch is turned into one that complies with NFL regulations.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/16/19597290-0-image-a-13_1570809440071.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
