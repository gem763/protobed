Get ready for an awesome trip as you bounce between theme parks, beaches and Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nBeen before? LA won\u2019t disappoint, even if you\u2019ve ticked off Disney and spotted film stars. Dig deep into the City of Angels and you\u2019ll find hidden histories, stunning architecture and the perfect, one-day American road trip.\n\nHere\u2019s the top ten of our under-the-radar LA experiences...\n\nFLY WITH ANGELS\n\nThe Angels Flight, above, is a 118-year-old funicular that claims to be the world\u2019s shortest rail journey\n\nForget theme-park rollercoasters and take a sedate ride on Angels Flight (angelsflight.org), the 118-year-old funicular that claims to be the world\u2019s shortest rail journey. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling made the trip in La La Land and the polished-wood interiors of its two railway cars have been regulars in films and TV shows. Ongoing maintenance issues mean it can close at short notice, but it aims to run daily until 10pm. It costs just $1 a ride and takes 30 seconds per \u2018flight\u2019.\n\nIf you\u2019re hungry, the lower station is a few blocks from LA\u2019s Grand Central Market (grandcentralmarket.com), the 100-year-old foodie heaven with everything from craft beer to \u2018specially curated cheese\u2019.\n\nTHE BOOK TOUR\n\nTake a break from the movies and put your head in a book at the biggest used-book store in California. Last Bookstore LA (lastbookstorela.com) on South Spring Street has more than 250,000 titles in its dusty, cavernous interior (plus a lot of vinyl in its record department). Rising rents in downtown LA mean it\u2019s already been forced to move twice (its new slogan is: \u2018What are you waiting for? We won\u2019t be here forever\u2019) and there are fears that competition from Amazon may soon force it to close for good.\n\nFortunately it\u2019s easy to show support. Lots of books cost just $1 and there\u2019s a full programme of readings and events in the evenings.\n\nTHE DEAD CELEBRITIES\n\nA Day Of The Dead celebration at the Hollywood Forever cemetery off Santa Monica Boulevard\n\nGraveyards are a big draw in LA. The most famous is Hollywood Forever Cemetery off Santa Monica Boulevard, where movie legends from Judy Garland to Cecil B. DeMille are buried. Surprisingly, the cemetery also has plenty of live music events (Hozier played in June) as well as regular \u2018cemetery screenings\u2019 with films projected on to the side of Rudolph Valentino\u2019s mausoleum. Popular choices include Rebel Without A Cause or, if you are feeling brave, Bride Of Frankenstein or The Shining.\n\nFor Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemon, Dean Martin, Frank Zappa and Burt Lancaster, head to the Pierce Brothers Memorial Park in Westwood. It\u2019s a working cemetery, so visitors should be respectful.\n\nMonroe\u2019s grave is relatively simple, slightly discoloured by 50 years of lipstick-covered kisses from fans. Seeing-stars.com has more information under Where Stars Are Buried.\n\nTAKE A HIKE\n\nDramatic vista: Walking behind the world-famous Hollywood sign, which offers spectacular views\n\nVenice Beach and its outdoor gym is the obvious place to see the body beautiful in action. But a short drive inland to the canyons is where Angelinos (including famous faces) go to hike, jog or walk their dogs.\n\nTop spot is Runyon Canyon, a few blocks from Hollywood Boulevard. It has 130 acres of hills including a 90-acre \u2018off-leash area\u2019 for dogs which is a great place to see celebrities. You get three key hiking trails, from the easy Runyon Canyon route to the tough Hero Trail.\n\nThere are wonderful views of the Hollywood sign, the Sunset Strip and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nTHE HOLLYWOOD HOTEL\n\nDazzling destination: Step inside the original \u2018home of Hollywood glamour\u2019 (and the setting for many of the first Oscars ceremonies) at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown LA (stock image)\n\nStep inside the original \u2018home of Hollywood glamour\u2019 (and the setting for many of the first Oscars ceremonies) at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel (millenniumhotels.com) in downtown LA. For almost 100 years it\u2019s hosted everyone from Prince Charles and The Beatles to Howard Hughes and JFK.\n\nIt\u2019s featured in The West Wing, Mad Men, Chinatown, Ghostbusters \u2013 and last year Taylor Swift danced on the reception desk in the video for her song Delicate. Recent guests say they\u2019ve seen ghosts on the 2nd, 9th, 10th and 11th floors \u2013 as well as in several of the lifts.\n\nThere are two-hour guided history tours every Sunday (\u00a312, book at laconservancy.org) or just walk through the vast, gilt-laden \u2018beaux arts\u2019 lobby on your way to getting a pizza, Chinese food or fine dining in one of its restaurants.\n\nTHE PHOTO STOPS\n\nStarring role: The Bradbury Building, above, which appeared in Blade Runner\n\nArchitecture fans love LA \u2013 for mid-century homes to modern icons like the Getty Museum and the Disney Concert Hall.\n\nBut two smaller buildings are Instagram favourites. The first is the inside of the Bradbury Building, a gleaming, recently restored honeycomb of open-cage lifts, wrought-iron balustrades and interconnecting staircases. It\u2019s been in everything from Blade Runner to the video of Justin Timberlake\u2019s Say Something.\n\nThe next is the \u2018Binoculars Building\u2019 that Frank Gehry created in beachside Venice. Cars and people get in the building under the huge sculpture of binoculars that Gehry had built outside. Now rented by Google, 340 Main Street is repeatedly voted by locals as one of the city\u2019s favourite buildings.\n\nHungry by the beach? Turn away from the boardwalk and experience Eggslut, the LA original restaurant that\u2019s taking the world by storm. The deliciously dirty breakfast and burger firm opened its first London branch this summer. But it was born in LA. Join the line, gawp for celebs and try the Gaucho, a brioche bun with seared steak and, of course, an egg, at the Pacific Avenue branch in Venice.\n\nNEED A DRINK?\n\nMost California wines come from Napa Valley, north of San Francisco. But grapes are also grown on the outskirts of LA in sunny Malibu. Head to the Rosenthal Estate (rosenthalestatewines.com) just off the Pacific Coast Highway to combine wine-tasting with celebrity-spotting (it\u2019s mega-rich Malibu, after all). Tastings start at about \u00a315 and fans rave about the lines of food trucks that park up outside the vineyard in time for lunch.\n\nAfterwards head to \u2018Billionaire\u2019s Beach\u2019 (real name Carbon Beach), which looks private but isn\u2019t. The discreet entrance is near the Malibu Aquarium and you\u2019ll see gorgeous properties from the sand.\n\nSPORTING GREATS\n\nSport comes second to cinema in LA. But the city isn\u2019t short of iconic venues for world teams. The Staples Center is home of the LA Lakers basketball team, the LA Kings hockey players and more. Front row courtside is where you might get lucky and see the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 and the Beckhams at games. Find out what\u2019s on and get tickets at staplescenter.com \u2013 as well as a full sports programme, Disney on Ice is moving in for a week before Christmas.\n\nFurther across town, the iconic Dodger Stadium, one of the oldest in the US, is the local home of baseball. If you don\u2019t want to see a game you can get to the pitch and into the Dodger dug-out on a 90-minute stadium tour, offered daily for \u00a315 (mlb.com/dodgers). Or hang out in a local bar on game night (or any night) where sports fans can be more welcoming than at home. Local tips include The Gold Room, with its classic dive bar feel, and the trendier, exposed brick and mellow-light look at nearby bar The Semi-Tropic.\n\nTHE SPACE RACE\n\nEndeavour space shuttle inside its hanger at the California Science Center in Los Angeles\n\nFrom Venice, hop on to the sparkling new, cheap and well air-conditioned LA metro (metro.net, trips start at about \u00a31.30) and head to Expo Park at the University of Southern California, where you\u2019ll find Endeavour, the world\u2019s only intact Space Shuttle (californiasciencecenter.org). Endeavour completed 25 missions and orbited the Earth nearly 5,000 times. It\u2019s now set in \u2018ready-to-launch\u2019 position in the University Science Center.\n\nYour \u00a35 entry ticket includes an IMAX screening and access to the rest of the huge museum. Children should enjoy the \u2018SpacePotty\u2019 exhibit that reveals what the curators describe as \u2018the high-tech solution to one of space travel\u2019s most pressing concerns\u2019: how to use the loo in zero gravity.\n\nHowever old you are, a walk round the nearby USC campus will make you feel like an American teenager and remind you of every college movie you\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nYou can pick up a plastic tray and eat with the students in the main self-service restaurant area \u2013 and for dessert, walk past the campus store and look for the pink \u2018only-in-LA\u2019 cupcake dispenser ATM. Colourful, heavily iced creations are sold through an old cash machine (sprinkles.com).\n\nTHE ROAD TRIP\n\nMulholland Drive is one of LA\u2019s iconic roads \u2013 and makes for the perfect one-day road trip. The route is actually divided into two. If you begin out east and head west (the best way), you start on some 20 miles of Mulholland Drive itself before picking up the 50 miles of Mulholland Highway (the bit that connects them is a little complicated, so take your time).\n\nAlong the way there are plenty of \u2018pull-outs\u2019 where you can park for photo-stops, including a perfect view of the Hollywood sign. Check out the Harley-Davidsons with chilled-out riders (dubbed gearheads) who chow down at the classic Rock Store diner (rock-store.com) halfway through the day. Then keep driving west towards Malibu. The road will twist and the landscape will change fast as you pass cliffs, canyons and expensive movie-star homes on your way to journey\u2019s end at the Pacific Ocean.", "description": "Here's our pick of the best under-the-radar Los Angeles experiences.
