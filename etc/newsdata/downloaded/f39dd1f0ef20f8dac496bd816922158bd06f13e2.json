Anyway... 6-0 and we go back home, at least we did our job.

I don't think that we have this big problem like, for example, England do.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe added: \"What I meant was that in the Bulgarian championship we've not had such problems while there have been incidents in various levels of English football involving racism, which I consider something normal because it's a big country with a very diverse population.\n\n\"But we don't have this problem in Bulgaria, I can assure you of that.\"", "description": "Bulgaria manager Krasimir Balakov accused England of having a bigger racism problem than his own country", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581061.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bulgaria-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
