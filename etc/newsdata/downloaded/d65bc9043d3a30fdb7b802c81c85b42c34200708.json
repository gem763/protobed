Laurent Grandet [ Guggenheim ] likes MDLZ, GIS.\n\nPg M3, Trader: A down week. Market was affected by Saudi oil supply disruption; Fed rate cut [on 7-3 vote]; Fed intervention in m-mkts to control repo rates; resumption of US-China trade talks. The Fed Is split over future rate outlook.\n\nAccording to Duetsche Bank [DB], over the past 12 years, global stocks with positive climate-change news outperformed the MSCI World Index by +0.8% [annualized], those with negative climate-change news underperformed the Index by -0.3%, and those with improving climate-change news outperformed the Index by +1.4%. The effect was pronounced for tech, consumer-staples, healthcare, and muted for energy, materials, utilities. Money tied to ESG factors is growing.\n\nThe Fed intervened in the m-mkts for 4 days to keep the repo rates under control. Normally the repo rates track the fed fund policy rate but they skyrocketed briefly to above 9%. Banks had an excess of Treasuries [some blame this on Fed balance sheet shrinkage] but shortage of cash. However, the picture was much different from the m-mkt instability in the 2008 financial crisis. Suggested solutions now include a standing facility by the Fed to exchange cash for Treasuries [sort of a flexible QE-lite] or restarting the QE. Foreign investors pulled back from the repo market as their hedging costs went up with the repo rate instability. This reduced liquidity in the m-mkts has negative implications for leveraged and risk assets.\n\n[The CME FedWatch tool, based on current fed fund futures quotes, shows the following probabilities for 2019:\n\nFor 3rd hike [cut],\n\n0% for hike [43.8% for cut] at FOMC 10/30/19;\n\n0% for hike [62.9% for cut] at FOMC 12/11/19;\n\nhttp://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html ]\n\nFor the week [index changes only], DJIA -1.05%, SP500 -0.51%, Nasdaq Comp -0.72%, Russell 2000 -1.16%. DJ Transports -3.32%; DJ Utilities +1.88%. US$ +0.20%, oil/WTI +5.91%, gold +1.10%.\n\nYTD [index changes only], DJIA +15.47%, SP500 +19.36%, Nasdaq Comp +22.34%.\n\nPg M6, Europe: Undervalued UK plumbing and heating firm Ferguson [FERG.uk/FERGY; fwd P/E 14.7] will split into UK business [to be named Wolseley ; 10% of sales] and US business [to retain Ferguson name; 90% of sales]. Peltz/ Trian acquired 6% stake in June and pushed for restructuring.\n\nPg M6, Emerging Markets: Saudi Arabian stock market [ETF KSA] hardly reacted to attacks on the oil facilities; after an initial spike in yields, bonds also recovered due to strong foreign demand. The IPO of 5% of Aramco remains on track although some terms may have to be adjusted. Unclear how these developments will affect the Crown Prince MBS. Investors looking for opportunities may consider Egypt as an indirect play.\n\nPg M9, Commodities: Impact of oil supply disruption from attack on Saudi Arabian facilities was not as bad as expected. There is excess global production capacity and also the global oil reserves. But the risk of further attacks and disruptions remains. There is also the possibility of disruption in oil transportation.\n\nPg M7, Options: With consumer-spending and economy slowing, consider bullish options strategies for comfort/fast-food stocks [CBRL, CMG, MCD, YUM, WEN, QSR] \u2013 sell puts and/or buy calls.\n\n[SP500 VIX 15.32, SKEW 117.50] [10-Yr TYVIX 5.61] [Yahoo Finance data]\n\nPg M23, M28: A flat week in Europe [Greece +1.53%, Norway +0.90, Finland -0.85%] and a down week in Asia [S Korea +1.73%, HK -3.63%]. The equity CEF index [data to Thursday] underperformed the DJIA and its discount was -5%.\n\nTreasury rates 3-mo yield 1.91%, 2-yr 1.69%, 5-yr 1.61%, 10-yr 1.74%, 30-yr 2.17% [Treasury data*]. Dollar rose, DXY 98.46, +0.3% [M31]. Gold was flat at $1,502, UNCH [notable deviation again from pg M3]; the gold-miners rose [M34].

Here\u2019s How\u201d. Beware of opioid exposure of drug manufacturers [JNJ, TEVA, MNK, MYL, etc], distributors [CAH, MCK, ABC, etc], pharmacies [CVS, WBA], PBMs. While the opioids are legal potent painkillers, they are often prescribed excessively [and those patients sell them to others] or supplied illegally. Governments and private groups are suing companies for the health costs from opioid abuse. Private Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy; JNJ lost a case that it is appealing. Lawyers don\u2019t want bankruptcy outcome but settlements for \u201cglobal peace\u201d. Many generics manufacturers with opioid exposure have high debt and are quite vulnerable. Drug distribution is a triopoly in the US, and as they face scrutiny, AMZN is looking to move into this area as a disruptor.\n\nPENTA supplement with focus on mission/impact investing. Features include treatment of river blindness, scabies, etc with support from MDGH , UN-WHO , Gates Foundation ; AI-art; model Behati Prinsloo\u2019s efforts to save animals in Namibia; designer Reed Krakoff\u2019s efforts to refresh Tiffany/TIF brands/lines; fashion designers Mark Badgley and James Mischeka move from NY to LA; wine collection; sport watches; collectible cars; Guy Hands of private equity firm Terra Firma and his efforts on diversity, equality, philanthropy; flipping luxury homes [7.2% of house sales are by flippers]; irrevocable trusts for healthcare for beneficiaries; health savings accounts [HSAs]; private jet travel.\n\nPg 9, Up & Down Wall Street: The Fed patched the problem in the m-mkts by injecting liquidity in the repo market. Boston Fed President Rosengren took an indirect aim at the postponed IPO of WeWork/WeCo that couldn\u2019t takeoff even at a quarter of its private market value; WeCo junk bond fell to 96.57. The model of getting long leases and then leasing them out short is inherently risky and banks may be stuck with defaulted loans/mortgages. The Fed has the difficult task of balancing calls for zero/negative rates vs 50-yr low unemployment rate and stocks near all-time highs.\n\nWall Street is worried about the presidential candidacy of Elizabeth Warren; in polls for 20 Democratic nominees, #1-Biden, #2-Warren, #3-Sanders. In online betting market, Warren is ahead of Biden [who may be his own worst enemy]. Warren\u2019s agenda includes breaking up companies, hiking taxes, regulating financial/banking industry, Medicare for all, etc. These would be negative for equities in general, but especially for pharma, healthcare, financials, big tech, defense, energy. Economy and geopolitics will be key issues for the elections in 2020.\n\nPg 13, Streetwise: Streaming rights for shows are going for crazy prices. Show producers get 30-40% cut. These may be loss-leaders as there is tough competition among streaming subscription services [ Disney+ , HBO Max , Peacock , Viacom/CBS xyz , Apple TV+ , etc].\n\nMore later\u2026.\n\nYBB", "description": "[ Italics-bold within the brackets are my additions/elaborations ] [ New M* Discussions doesn\u2019t allow any colors for cut-and-paste from WORD ] MW - 23707", "authors": ["Contributor", "Explorer", "Follower"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
