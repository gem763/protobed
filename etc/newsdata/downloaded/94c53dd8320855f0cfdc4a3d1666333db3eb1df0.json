Results came back and in a few days we had to exterminate the rest of the pigs.\"\n\nWe found another three locals with the same story: their pig died, the local vet in each case told them that the pig was infected with swine flu and ordered the extermination of the rest of the stock. The owners were told to wait patiently for compensation.\n\n\"We confirm again that laboratory examinations did not find the virus in samples from domestic pigs in Hungary,\" said NEBIH in a statement. \"A number of other diseases might raise the suspicion of the African Swine Flu, like the Aujeszky-disease, salmonellosis, pasteurellosis, and so on.\n\n\"But we have to consider the possibility of swine flu infection in the case of any illness starting with a high fever that would not react to treatment. This is why the authority takes severe preventive measures based on bare suspicion.\u201d\n\nAround ten European Union countries are currently affected by African swine fever, with particularly bad outbreaks in Bulgaria and its neighbour Romania. Slovakia was affected by the disease in four backyard farms as of July.\n\nLate last month five cases of swine fever in wild boar were found near Budapest. By this time about a quarter of the area of Hungary was qualified \"infected\u201d or \"high risk\u201d by NEBIH. More than 5,000 domestic pigs were exterminated as a safety measure.", "description": "Has Hungary's swine flu epidemic infected its pig population?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/76/98/1000x563_cmsv2_cf3b44fb-6a96-5741-8e6c-0bd34bb4ff3d-4217698.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
