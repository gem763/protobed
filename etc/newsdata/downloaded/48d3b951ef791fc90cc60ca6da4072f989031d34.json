The FDA said Eonsmoke broke federal law by marketing tobacco products with flavors like mango, cotton candy, sour gummy worm and others without FDA permission.\n\nEonsmoke has been marketing its tobacco products as presenting a lower risk of tobacco-related diseases than other tobacco products, such as claiming that its e-cigs \u201cprovide you with a premium vaping experience without the thousands of harmful chemicals and additives often found in tobacco cigarettes,\u201d according to the FDA. Officials said they were citing the company for the marketing claims, which they said had not been reviewed by the agency.\n\nAlso, the company has advertised through social media influencers without including a required nicotine warning statement, according to the FDA.\n\nThis was the second time the FDA has warned Eonsmoke about its marketing, which acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless called \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking today\u2019s action because Eonsmoke has ignored the law by marketing dozens of unauthorized e-cigarette products,\u201d he said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 1,604 cases of lung injury related to e-cig or vape use had been reported, including 34 confirmed deaths.

Sharpless said preliminary data from the FDA\u2019s annual youth tobacco survey show a continued rise in youth e-cigarette use.\n\n\u201cThe marketing of illegal electronic nicotine delivery system products is particularly concerning given the epidemic of youth vaping that we\u2019re facing, which we know has resulted in part from irresponsible practices of manufacturers, importers and retailers who have targeted kids in their marketing and has been fueled by flavored products that we know are appealing to kids,\u201d Sharpless said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Officials said Eonsmoke broke federal law with its marketing.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Kids-vaping.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
