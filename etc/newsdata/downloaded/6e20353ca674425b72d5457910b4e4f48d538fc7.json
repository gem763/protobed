(iStock/iStock)\n\nThe House Oversight Committee is investigating why a financially struggling airport near a Trump-owned golf course in Scotland has seen an uptick in expenditures by the U.S. military since President Trump took office.\n\nChairman Elijah E. Cummings and Rep. Jamie Raskin, both Maryland Democrats, sent a letter to the Defense Department\u2019s acting secretary, Patrick M. Shanahan, in June asking for all travel information pertaining to Pentagon personnel through the Glasgow Prestwick Airport, as well as visits to the Trump Turnberry golf resort.\n\nIn the letter, Cummings and Raskin say that the airport \u201creportedly has provided \u2018cut-price rooms for select passengers and crew\u2019 and \u2018offered free rounds at Turnberry to visiting U.S. military and civilian air crews.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTrump purchased the cash-strapped golf course on the west coast of Scotland in 2014 and has never turned a profit on his investment. In the years after his purchase, Trump advocated bringing more flights through Prestwick Airport, which would benefit his property just 30 miles away.\n\nThe Oversight Committee members cite a February 2018 story in the Guardian stating that the Defense Logistics Agency has helped shore up the airport\u2019s income by stopping there for refueling during missions. Since October 2017, the Pentagon has spent $11 million on fuel at Prestwick.\n\nPolitico, which first reported the Oversight investigation, described one Air National Guard trip to Kuwait in which the crew stopped at Trump\u2019s Turnberry property on the way there and back. Typically, crews refuel in locations where there are U.S. military bases.\n\nThis investigation dovetails with the committee\u2019s larger review of potential conflicts of interest between Trump\u2019s role as president and his businesses, particularly when it relates to foreign governments and possible violations of the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says a U.S. president cannot take money or gifts from a foreign leader or government.\n\nNews of the letter comes after Vice President Pence\u2019s recent stay at a Trump property in Ireland, far from his meetings in Dublin, raised eyebrows. The Oversight panel is also investigating whether Trump benefited financially from Pence\u2019s choice of lodging on the taxpayer\u2019s dime.\n\nRachael Bade contributed to this report.", "description": "The Oversight Committee has sought information on Pentagon personnel\u2019s use of a Glasgow airport and visits to the nearby Trump Turnberry golf resort.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/f0MN4shzWPzCZBsc41eFEO8Xhbc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IVAXNDVOLUI6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
