This unusual development assumes significance as Hajela has been blamed for the outcome of the apex court monitored NRC exercise. About 1.9 million people failed to meet NRC requirements and now are in limbo. These results attracted criticism from members of BJP which is in government in Assam. The transfer order ends Hajela\u2019s association with NRC for all practical purposes but he had been given mission impossible in the first place. Instead of scapegoating him, it needs to be understood that NRC is fundamentally flawed.\n\nThe long-standing Assam cause to sift illegal migrants from citizens is unexceptionable but in practical terms, the exercise to detect illegal immigrants proved too painful and ineffective. In essence one had to prove one\u2019s citizenship based on documentation. Insisting on rigourous documentation in a country where records are scanty is problematic. It is precisely because of poor documentation in India that the Aadhaar application provides a pathway for people without documents. Even for people with documents, the NRC exercise was not easy. The true costs involved for the entire society may never be known.\n\nYet, BJP is pushing for NRC in other states. Home minister Amit Shah has even brought up a nationwide NRC, an idea RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi echoed last week. But the costs of having to prove citizenship in this way categorically outweigh the purported benefits. After all, despite the long court-monitored exercise in Assam no one seems happy with its outcome. The way forward should be to curb loopholes which allow illegal immigration to take place. This is a far more productive way to allocate resources than to disrupt entire states, causing widespread socio-economic damage.", "description": "Supreme Court last week ordered the transfer of IAS officer Prateek Hajela, coordinator of Assam\u2019s National Register of Citizens, to Madhya Pradesh.
