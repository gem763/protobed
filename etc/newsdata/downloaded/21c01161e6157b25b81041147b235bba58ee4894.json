The move will apply to all 10 districts of the Kashmir valley, he told a press briefing in Srinagar on Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government cut off telephone and internet lines in Jammu and Kashmir ahead of revoking the state's special rights on Aug. 5, striking down long-standing constitutional provisions for the Muslim-majority region that is also claimed by neighboring Pakistan.\n\nBefore that decision, Indian authorities also made mass arrests in Kashmir, including of political leaders and activists, evacuated tourists, and flooded the region with troops, citing possible militant attacks by Pakistan-backed groups - assertions that Islamabad has rejected.\n\nThe communication restrictions have hit people's access to healthcare and services and rights groups have been calling for them to be removed. In August, United Nations experts termed the curbs \"a form of collective punishment.\"\n\nThe restrictions have gradually been eased. Landlines were allowed to operate last month, and an advisory asking tourists to not travel to the region was lifted earlier this week.\n\nWhile internet remains blocked, Kansal said internet kiosks were being set up, some specifically for tourists.\n\nHe also said travel restrictions had been lifted from \"more than 99%\" of the state. But checkpoints remain in place and communication restrictions have made reporting from the region difficult.\n\nProtests have flared in Kashmir despite the curbs, and critics say India's move will alienate Kashmiris further and fuel armed resistance.\n\nLocals have resisted attempts by authorities to show things are back to normal, with many keeping their shops closed while students and teachers have largely stayed away from schools.\n\nIndia said the restrictions were aimed at preventing protests and unrest in Kashmir, where it has been fighting multiple insurgencies for decades.\n\n\"Credible inputs continue to be received of the likelihood of large scale terrorist attacks, sponsored by forces inimical to the nation and from outside its borders,\u201d Kansal said.", "description": "India set to partially restore mobile phone lines in Kashmir", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9B0CO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
