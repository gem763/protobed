Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nThey say that sharks are natural hunters, but Sunday\u2019s \u201cShark Tank\u201d had the sharks leaving the tank to chase after two entrepreneurs.\n\nMarc Lickfett and Mikael Soderlindh are the creator of Knife Aid, a mail service knife sharpening company. Drop your dull blades in the post, and in less than a week and for $10 a knife, the company will make them sharp enough to cut through a pineapple or rope (as sharks Kevin O\u2019Leary and Rohan Oza demonstrated).\n\nSoderlindh has experience building successful global brands, including Swedish clothing brand Happy Socks. But because of a past failure, the two came on the show seeking the help of a shark who better understands the U.S. market.\n\nMikael Soderlindh and Marc Lickfett, entrepreneurs from Malibu, California, have modernized an age-old craft by offering knife sharpening by mail. They brought their company to \"Shark Tank.\" (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\n\u201cWe had another brand going into the American market without having American people involved in the business,\u201d Soderlindh said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that mistake again.\u201d\n\nShark Lori Greiner liked their concept: \u201cYou\u2019re fresh. You\u2019re unique. You\u2019re different. You\u2019ve already got the packaging down. It\u2019s really quite good. I think you are smart in needing to know what the market is here.\u201d She offered them $200,000 and an additional $200,000 as a line of credit for a 20% stake.\n\nNot responding to the offer, the two entrepreneurs discussed their plans to put advertising for their service in retail stores. An exasperated Greiner raised her phone and mimed a scroll through her contact list: \u201cListen guys, I could be like, 'Pick a contact. Any contact.' Everything I offered you is what you\u2019re asking for.\u201d\n\nMore: 'Shark Tank' exclusive: The new list of the 20 best-selling products from the show\n\nThe sharks in the tank this week: Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, Kevin O'Leary, Lori Greiner, Rohan Oza (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nBut O\u2019Leary wanted them on Team Chef Wonderful. He offered them $400,000 for 20% of their company. \u201cI have all the same contacts, but I have something she doesn\u2019t have. I\u2019m Chef Wonderful. Chef Wonderful is huge in cakes, chocolates and meats. Google him, he\u2019s fantastic.\u201d\n\nMatching O\u2019Leary\u2019s offer, Greiner sweetened the deal by partnering with Oza. Soderlindh and Lickfett would get double the sharks for the same price. Oza said: \u201cWhen you get the Queen of Retail and put that together with the King of Branding, that\u2019s quite the pairing.\u201d\n\nBut Greiner wasn\u2019t the only one who could partner. O\u2019Leary teamed up with fellow shark Barbara Corcoran; they offered $500,000 for 20%.\n\nBut the creators of Knife Aid were reluctant to accept either offer. Greiner noticed they kept glancing at shark Mark Cuban, who was notably quiet: \u201cAre you waiting for Mark to give you an offer?\u201d\n\nFor his part, Cuban believed he could bolster Knife Aid\u2019s brand awareness, but he would wait to see what they decided with the deals they had been offered.\n\nBefore stepping into the hallway to discuss the deals with Lickfett, Soderlindh asked the sharks how passionate they were about his company and how much time they would invest. O\u2019Leary and Greiner each insisted they were the best shark for the job.\n\nCuban shook his head at his fellow sharks: \u201cDamn, you guys grovel enough? I don\u2019t beg or grovel. I\u2019m a (expletive) shark.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not above doing whatever it takes,\u201d Greiner replied, and to prove her point, she decided she had waited long enough. She left the tank to track down Soderlindh and Lickfett. \u201cYou want to know about passion. I\u2019m not sitting and waiting. I want this deal.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Leary was right behind her, followed by Oza and Corcoran. Soderlindh was interested in making a deal with Greiner and Oza, but wanted them to match the $500,000. The two sharks quickly agreed and struck the deal.\n\n\u201cHaving four sharks running after us into the hallways is something I would have never dreamed of,\u201d Soderlindh said.\n\nBack in the tank, Cuban agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s a new breed of shark that grovels.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/21/shark-tank-hungry-sharks-circle-around-knife-sharpening-business/4048496002/", "description": "Sunday\u2019s \u201cShark Tank\u201d had the sharks leaving the tank to chase after entrepreneurs who created Knife Aid, a mail service knife sharpening company.", "authors": ["Matthew Wilson", "Special To Usa Today", "Published P.M.
