They were the purest example to love that I have ever seen. They showed me that true love did exist in the world. The way they loved their mom @juleshough and the way she loved them back was the first time I knew that there was hope for me to have love in my life. And they accepted me into their little family, and helped me become a dad for the first time.\u201d\n\nHealing vibes go out to the Hough family during this tough time.\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
