However, Rivers said Leonard \u201chas never felt better.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers notified the NBA of their plans in advance and are in compliance with the league, according to Rachel Nichols of ESPN.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the point of the rule? This just opens the door selective enforcement and accusations of such.\n\nThe Clippers host the Spurs tomorrow, and that could factor. There\u2019s more intrigue with Leonard facing his former team (which he left on bad terms) than seeing Leonard play Utah. This looks like a scheduling error, putting the Clippers on national television in the first leg of a back-to-back with the second game more interesting (though San Antonio at L.A. is not nationally televised).\n\nBut there will never be perfect scheduling. The underlying issues remain. Both owners and players collectively want the revenue of an 82-game schedule. However, individual teams don\u2019t want to put their stars through the rigors of an 82-game schedule. The Clippers\u2019 best chance of winning a championship means resting Leonard during the regular season and saving him for the playoffs. In the long run, Leonard missing one nationally televised game is a drop in the bucket. But many other teams are making the same calculations with their star players. These absences will add up.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd other teams will wonder if they\u2019ll get the same leniency the Clippers received tonight.", "description": "A couple years ago, NBA commissioner Adam Silver received power to fine teams for resting players in nationally televised games.
