Not even for 500m euros.\n\n'Phil\u2019s going nowhere \u2014 Phil is City. We won\u2019t be signing anyone else for that position.\n\n'When David Silva leaves, we know exactly who our new magician will be.'\n\nSilva's contract at Manchester City will expire at the end of this season and plans to leave\n\nGuardiola also believes there is a special edge to Foden because the 19-year-old grew up through City's academy.\n\nOthers have, indeed, left before namely Jadon Sancho and Brahim Diaz but Guardiola is certain Foden sees his future at the Etihad. He also defended the way he has utilised the young midfielder in his side.\n\n'He\u2019s grown up with us. He\u2019s one of us and he\u2019s going to be brilliant \u2014 one of the Premier League\u2019s best.\n\n'One thing is clear, Foden has a place in City\u2019s first team.\n\n'I\u2019d be interested to see if a different manager would have given him his chance to develop, or loaned him out.\n\n'I don\u2019t like leaving him out of certain games but must think of the whole squad. Phil understands that.'", "description": "Pep Guardiola has again tipped Phil Foden for a big future and has admitted he wouldn't even sell the Manchester City youngster for '500 million euros'.
