GBTA research shows 515 million domestic business trips are taken in a year. Nearly 30 percent involve air travel \u2014 meaning business travelers take to the skies over 144 million trips a year.\n\nBusiness travel and air travel are vital for the U.S. and world economy. But climate activists and some \u201cgreen\u201d politicians have targeted commercial air travel to make it out to be the biggest offenders of the environment when that\u2019s just not correct. Airlines are responsible for 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMake no mistake: The travel industry is concerned with the environment and is taking responsible actions to address climate concerns on a global level. Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, or \u201cCORSIA,\u201d calls for carbon-neutral growth in international commercial aviation beginning in 2021. Over 75 percent of international aviation emissions growth after 2020 will be offset elsewhere through the U.N.-backed CORSIA. To date, 78 countries have signed up as part of an initial voluntary phase starting in 2021, with others joining in 2027. CORSIA will provide billions in funding for CO2 abatement efforts all over the world.\n\nHowever, some environmental activists don\u2019t support these global initiatives and are instead trying to shame people from flying (#flightshame). Politicians are looking to impose various taxes on air travel to make it more expensive in hopes of depressing air travel. Reducing flights will make a small impact on the environment but a large negative impact on the global economies.\n\nBusiness travel is an economic driver that is essential to a healthy and growing economy because it allows businesspeople to connect with one another, to meet face to face, make deals and conduct commerce that grow and create jobs throughout the world. GBTA research backs this by finding for every 1 percent change in business travel spending, the U.S. economy gains or loses 74,000 jobs, $5.5 billion in GDP, $3.3 billion in wages and $1.3 billion in taxes.\n\nThe business travel industry, like most other industries, is concerned about its effects on the environment. Working to address a global problem must be done from a global perspective.\n\nImposing a random patchwork of taxes will only create confusion and higher prices without addressing the environmental concerns. Working together, as we are, with initiatives mentioned above as well as others, will be how we positively impact environmental change for the benefit of all.\n\nScott Solombrino is Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director of the Global Business Travel Association.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
