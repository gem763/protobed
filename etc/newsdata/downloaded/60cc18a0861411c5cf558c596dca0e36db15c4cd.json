Now Bolton is turning his sights on the president.", "language": "en", "text": "John Bolton publicly rebuked President Trump\u2019s diplomatic outreach to North Korea on Monday, a signal that the former White House national security adviser could assume a role as an outspoken critic of a president with whom he was often at odds.\n\nTrump brought Bolton onboard in April 2018 after being impressed by his pugnacious foreign policy views, voiced during frequent appearances on Fox News. But the president now faces the prospect that his former adviser, who was ousted three weeks ago, could aim his unsparing, critical fire at the White House at a time when Trump faces political peril from the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats into his conduct with another foreign leader.\n\nBolton made no mention of the mounting scandal in his first public remarks since leaving the administration. But he delivered a forceful performance that left no ambiguity that he believes Trump is pursuing a losing strategy on North Korea.\n\nAt the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Bolton warned that leader Kim Jong Un has no intention of relinquishing his nuclear weapons, despite three meetings with Trump over the past 15 months. And he argued that U.S. economic sanctions are not being effectively enforced and suggested that he thinks the United States should consider pursuing regime change in Pyongyang or a military first strike against Kim\u2019s arsenal.\n\nNorth Korea \u201chas not made a strategic decision to give up their nuclear weapons. I think the contrary is true,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThe strategic decision Kim Jong Un has made is to do whatever he can to keep nuclear weapons capability and development.\u201d\n\nHis remarks came as the White House lashed out at the deepening House probe of Trump\u2019s call with Ukranian President Volodymr Zelensky in July, during which Trump asked him to conduct an investigation into presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden. It is unclear whether Bolton was aware of the details of the call during his time as national security adviser.\n\nWhite House officials declined to comment on Bolton\u2019s North Korea remarks, noting that he did not criticize Trump by name.\n\nFormer U.S. government officials had mixed reactions to Bolton\u2019s willingness to speak out so pointedly just weeks after leaving the administration. After Bolton was forced out in early September, Trump ripped his former aide, saying he did not blame Kim for wanting \u201cnothing to do\u201d with him. Bolton had consistently held a hard line on the talks with the North, demanding that the Kim regime relinquish its full nuclear weapons arsenal before any U.S. sanctions were lifted.\n\n[\u2018I don\u2019t blame Kim Jong Un\u2019: In dismissing Bolton, Trump sides with North Korean leader \u2014 again]\n\nChristopher R. Hill, who served as the lead U.S. negotiator during the six-party talks with North Korea during the George W. Bush administration, has criticized Trump\u2019s strategy. But he said Bolton, who had a stormy and short-lived tenure in the State Department during the Bush years, has a history of being \u201ctotally disrespectful\u201d after leaving public office.\n\n\u201cI think what we see from John Bolton today is what we\u2019ve seen from him in the past, and that is that he simply does not understand he is not working for himself,\u201d Hill said.\n\nHill said that Trump\u2019s personal summitry with Kim resembles a \u201cglobal reality TV show.\u201d But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think John Bolton should be the one sounding the alarm. He should show decent respect for people who took a chance on him and maybe give them some more time.\u201d\n\nOthers said Bolton was within his rights to warn the public about the inherent risks of negotiating with North Korea, given his proximity to Trump\u2019s diplomatic efforts.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear him say the word \u2018Trump,\u2019 \u201d said Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state in the Bush administration and participated in a different panel at the CSIS event. \u201cBy all accounts, he fought to have a more sensible policy [on North Korea]. John Bolton realizes \u2014 like everyone except Donald Trump and [South Korean President] Moon Jae-in \u2014 that Kim Jong Un has no intention of denuclearizing.\u201d\n\n[North Korea says it\u2019s willing to hold talks with the U.S. in September \u2014 then launches two more missiles]\n\nOrganizers of the CSIS event, which was co-sponsored by the JoongAng Il-bo, a South Korean newspaper, said they asked Bolton to participate shortly after he left the Trump administration.\n\nBolton was paid a fee \u2014 negotiated by his representatives at the Washington Speakers Bureau \u2014 that was in the tens of thousands of dollars, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private negotiations. Victor Cha, a former Bush administration official who runs the CSIS\u2019s Korea Chair, declined to comment, and a message left with the Washington Speakers Bureau was not returned.\n\nBolton had offered direct criticisms of Trump\u2019s policies on Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea during a private event at the Gatestone Institute two weeks ago, according to Politico. He has also participated in an interview for a magazine article that has yet to be published, according to a person familiar with the discussion.\n\nHowever, Bolton has told associates that he is saving his juiciest material for a book on his time in the Trump White House, two people familiar with his plans said.\n\nThough there was some trepidation within the State Department before Bolton\u2019s CSIS appearance, one U.S. official dismissed his performance as a recitation of well-known positions that are out of step with the public\u2019s desire to reduce tensions with North Korea.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows his position on the issue,\u201d the official said.\n\nTrump has touted the North\u2019s nearly two-year moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles as a sign of the Kim regime\u2019s good-faith negotiations. But Bolton made clear at the CSIS that he believes Pyongyang\u2019s multiple tests of short-range missiles over the summer violated long-standing U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n\nThe moratorium on nuclear testing \u201ctells us nothing about North Korea\u2019s intentions or strategy,\u201d he added.\n\nThe North will \u201cnever give up enough voluntarily, for me,\u201d Bolton said, noting that it would require Kim to agree to an \u201cinspection system so robust and thorough they may well think it threatens the viability of their regime.\u201d\n\n[John Bolton\u2019s turbulent tenure comes to a Trumpian end]\n\nThough Bolton had accompanied Trump to two summit meetings with Kim, including the second, in Hanoi in February, which collapsed without a deal, he was noticeably absent from Trump\u2019s handshake with Kim in the Korean demilitarized zone in June. That meeting was aimed at restarting nuclear talks, but no lower-level negotiations have taken place since then, despite Pyongyang stating it was open to restarting dialogue this month.\n\nIn his CSIS remarks, Bolton was careful not to stray into personal attacks on the president. But he excoriated Trump for not calling North Korea\u2019s short-range missile tests a direct violation of U.N. resolutions.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea today, as we speak, is violating resolutions,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cWhen the United States is the one having led the fight to get those resolutions, and you say you really don\u2019t care, other countries can draw the conclusion that they really don\u2019t care about the sanctions contained in those resolutions.\u201d\n\nSue Mi Terry, a former Korea analyst at the CIA during the Bush administration, said she was struck by how little Bolton\u2019s position on North Korea changed during his time in the White House.\n\n\u201cIt was surprising to me that after meeting with Kim and dealing with diplomacy, his views are exactly the same,\u201d she said.\n\nJohn Hudson contributed to this report.", "description": "The former national security adviser rebuked Trump\u2019s North Korea policy at a public forum, signaling he could become a prominent critic.", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/96lfLWE2u5754o6RSYd6tG6Ylb0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RU5NWAHDRUI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
