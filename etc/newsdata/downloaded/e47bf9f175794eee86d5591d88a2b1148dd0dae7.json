And b) because it confirmed what I\u2019ve long suspected: there\u2019s really nothing peaceful or \u2018nice\u2019 about these posturing, deluded, \u2018planet-saving\u2019 pests.\n\nI\u2019ve put the \u2018planet-saving\u2019 in inverted commas because the only place these soap-shunning losers are saving the planet is in their warped imaginations.\n\nSome of them are even honest enough to admit it. Here is one of the founding members of Extinction Rebellion (XR), telling it like it is on Medium:\n\nSo Extinction Rebellion isn\u2019t about the climate. It\u2019s not even about \u2018climate justice\u2019**, although that is also important. If we only talk about the climate, we\u2019re missing the deeper problems plaguing our culture. And if we don\u2019t excise the cause of the infection, we can never hope to heal from it. This article is calling to all of those who are involved in XR who sometimes slip into saying it\u2019s a climate movement. It\u2019s a call to the American rebels who made a banner saying \u201cCLIMATE extinction rebellion\u201d. It\u2019s a call to the XR Media & Messaging teams to never get sloppy with the messaging and \u2018reduce\u2019 it to climate issues. It\u2019s a call to the XR community to never say we\u2019re a climate movement. Because we\u2019re not.\n\nYes, I think the piece\u2019s author Stuart Basden, has made it pretty clear that Extinction Rebellion is not about the climate.\n\nSo what, then, is it about?\n\nBasden himself doesn\u2019t appear to have much of a clue.\n\nAt one point, he writes:\n\nWe\u2019re facing imminent societal collapse (whatever that means), both around the world and in the UK.\n\nThat parenthesis speaks volumes. \u2018Imminent societal collapse\u2019 is just another empty phrase to be brandished alongside all the other emotive catchphrases like \u2018future generations\u2019 and \u2018time is running out.\u2019\n\nBut what else would you expect from a movement whose spiritual leader is a 16-year old autistic school drop out who thinks she can see \u2018carbon\u2019 in the skies and who apparently gets her science facts from Ice Age 2?\n\nElsewhere in his article, Basden has a good old rant about some of his other obsessions:\n\nThe delusion of white-supremacy centres whiteness and the experience of white people, constructing and perpetuating the myth that white people and their lives are somehow inherently better and more valuable than people of colour.\n\ncentres whiteness and the experience of white people, constructing and perpetuating the myth that white people and their lives are somehow inherently better and more valuable than people of colour. The delusion of patriarchy centres the male experience, and excludes/hinders female assigned people from public life (reducing them to a possession or object for ownership or consumption). Patriarchy teaches dominating and competitive behaviours, and emphasises the idea that the world is a place of scarcity, separation and powerlessness.\n\ncentres the male experience, and excludes/hinders female assigned people from public life (reducing them to a possession or object for ownership or consumption). Patriarchy teaches dominating and competitive behaviours, and emphasises the idea that the world is a place of scarcity, separation and powerlessness. The delusions of Eurocentrism include the notion that Europeans know what is best for the world.\n\ninclude the notion that Europeans know what is best for the world. The delusions of hetero-sexism/heteronormativity propagate the idea that heterosexuality is \u2018normal\u2019 and that other expressions of sexuality are deviant.\n\npropagate the idea that heterosexuality is \u2018normal\u2019 and that other expressions of sexuality are deviant. The delusions of class hierarchy uphold the theory that the rich elite are better/smarter/nobler than the rest of us, and make therefore better decisions.\n\nIn other words, Extinction Rebellion is imbued with the kind of pseudo-academic, post-modernist, neo-Marxist intersectional guff that they teach at universities these days \u2013 and which bears a great deal of responsibility for the widespread madness afflicting our age and poisoning relationships between the young and old, between races and religions, between the two [nb] sexes, between social classes and so on.\n\nWhat also struck me as I wandered among the Extinction Rebellion crowds, feeling the loathing oozing from the ones that recognised me (I\u2019m quite the hate figure in greenie circles, for some odd reason) was just how blinkered, prejudiced and ill-informed these people are.\n\nDid they but know it \u2014 and I did try to explain this to some of them \u2014 I care at least as passionately about the environment as any of them do.\n\nIndeed, I\u2019d just come from a meeting with Mike Shellenberger, a green activist once named a \u2018Hero of the Environment\u2019 by Time magazine.\n\nShellenberger is a Democrat from the Peoples\u2019 Republic of California, founder and president of a think tank called Environmental Progress, and was an early campaigner for the renewables program later adopted by President Obama. Despite all this we got on like a house on fire because, though we disagree on some minor issues \u2013 he thinks \u2018climate change\u2019 is a problem; I don\u2019t \u2013 we agree on the fundamentals: the stuff being done to save the planet is actually killing it \u2013 and as nature lovers this drives both of us insane.\n\nWatch: Mike Shellenberger and James Delingpole talk Extinction Rebellion and why they\u2019re so wrong\n\n\n\nWe both agreed strongly that Extinction Rebellion\u2019s war on economic growth \u2014 among all the other things it would love to ban: air travel, cars, etc \u2014 is the very last thing either the planet or future generations need.\n\nIt\u2019s prosperity that enables us to have the money we need to care for our environment. Poverty just makes things worse. It\u2019s no coincidence that the world\u2019s worst environmental disasters of the last 100 years happened mostly either in the developing world or behind the Iron Curtain.\n\nBut when you try explaining this stuff to the Extinction Rebellion crowd they just don\u2019t want to know. They are so convinced of the rightness of their cause they don\u2019t want any pesky facts to get in the way of their belief system.\n\nI suppose they think just the same about people like me. Indeed, I know they do: the ones who confronted me, such as the chap you see on camera having a go at me, assume that everything I say about the environment I say in bad faith.\n\nThat is, they all think I\u2019m a wicked \u2018denier\u2019 who only says sceptical things about climate change and the environment because I am paid lavishly to do so either by Big Oil or by the rabid right-wing media.\n\nI can\u2019t say I blame them for thinking this way: it\u2019s all they\u2019ve been taught in schools; all they ever hear at college and university; all they ever read in the mainstream media or see on TV.\n\nThey have been brainwashed and propagandised into green groupthink.\n\nSo it\u2019s all very well mocking freaks like the guy dressed in the clown suit, and the weeping dad blubbing next to a photo of his children, and the idiots doing dances and yoga classes and saying: \u201cEnough is enough! This time we need to get serious about these idiots blocking our streets.\u201d We \u2014 by which I mean our culture, rather than you or me personally \u2014 have created this problem by allowing all this junk-science, greenie nonsense these loons are spouting to go largely uncriticised by anyone, anywhere.\n\nDissenting voices to the green fake news narrative are so rarely heard \u2014 on the BBC, they are more or less banned \u2014 that it\u2019s no wonder that kids are frightened the world is going to end in twelve years and that XR feel morally justified in causing such disruption and economic damage and human misery.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has dismissed the XR crowd as \u2018nose-ringed crusties in hemp smelling bivouacs\u2018. And he has a point.\n\nBut isn\u2019t this the same Boris Johnson whose government is committed to making the UK economy Net Zero of CO2 emissions by 2040 \u2013 an aim which is not only impossible without causing tremendous disruption, damage and expense to British industry and consumer freedom, but which also has no sound scientific justification whatsoever?\n\nI\u2019ll leave the last word on this to Matt Ridley, the Oxford-educated zoologist, now a member of the House of Lords, who is one of passing few politicians to talk sense on this issue.\n\nAuthor Lord Matt Ridley: \"A whole generation has been talked into this extreme apocalyptic rhetoric that is just not supported by the facts.\"@JuliaHB1 | @mattwridley | #ExtinctionRebellion pic.twitter.com/uue3cPrG4A \u2014 talkRADIO (@talkRADIO) October 8, 2019\n\nInterviewed by Julia Hartley-Brewer, he said:\n\n\u201cWhat worries me is that the Establishment \u2013 in terms of journalists, politicians and scientists too \u2013 have kind of talked a whole generation into this extreme apocalyptic rhetoric which is just not supported by the facts\u201d.\n\nPrecisely.
