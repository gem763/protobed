Despite many factories claiming to follow regulations and promising \u201cfancy certifications\u201d, he realised that it was a lot cheaper for factories to \u201cbuy\u201d certificates than to follow the sustainability measures necessary to be given them legitimately. he saw extreme exploitation and waste being dumped into rivers whilst consumers were being fed information about cleaner factories and better working conditions.\n\nThe tag can be scanned on your phone to get information about how your product was made PaperTale\n\nIn order to fight corruption, Bhatti created PaperTale, a platform that uses blockchain to allow consumers to confirm exactly where their product has come from and empower them to make informed decisions. \u201cThe technology can be implemented in basically all products,\u201d he says, \u201cgiving the consumers the power to make informed buying decisions about everything, which itself would push companies to act more sustainable instead of just saying they are with claims that can\u2019t be verified\u201d.\n\nPaperTale\u2019s proof of concept has a smart tag that, once scanned using your smartphone, provides you with an insight into the lives of the workers that made your product as well as a real-time environmental footprint all verified by blockchain technology.\n\nRead More | 5 of the best gadgets to create a fully equipped indoor garden\n\nBut what is blockchain?\n\nImagine there is a spreadsheet in which everyone writes down their part in the process of making a product. No one person is in charge and everyone involved has a complete copy of this spreadsheet to which they can add their own information but no one can change it. Information can only be added in chronological \u201cblocks\u201d and is considered essentially impossible to change once added thanks to complex cryptographic security. This is, in simple terms, how blockchain works.\n\nYou might have heard of the technology during the recent cryptocurrency boom where so far incorruptible currencies like bitcoin began to gain popularity across the world. Bhatti has found another innovative way to use this secure information system; to help you make responsible choices when you buy.\n\nFounder Bilal Bhatti PaperTale\n\n\u201cWe wanted to create a more or less \u2018in-corruptible\u2019 platform, where the data could actually be confirmed for consumers to see,\u201d he explains \u201c blockchain is the most secure way to confirm information and transactions.\u201d The founder hopes that, by making certification truly verifiable, the technology behind PaperTale will encourage businesses to stop thinking solely of their profit and start thinking about implementing real, sustainable changes.\n\nThis is about more than just catching out companies making false claims; Bhatti is optimistic that the platform can inspire people to seek out transparency. \u201cWe want to create a community of people who wants a better life for their grandkids, who realize that we are all able to make a difference as long as we come together,\u201d he says, \u201cPaperTale is our attempt to create such a community and the potential to further develop the technology is almost endless.\u201d\n\nPaperTale is launching a kickstarter on 13th November and you can find out more about this and the project on their website.", "description": "Bilal Bhatti, founder of PaperTale wants to be able to verify the claims companies make about sustainability.", "authors": ["Rosie Frost"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/27/02/18/1000x563_cmsv2_779b8205-f263-5398-b6d8-d18623eff84c-4270218.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
