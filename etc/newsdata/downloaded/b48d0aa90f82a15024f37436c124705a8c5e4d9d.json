His two messages about a mass shooting in Texas on Saturday, for example, quickly sank to the bottom of a murky Twitter morass clogged with presidential forecasts.\n\nWith his reality-show approach to the presidency, Mr Trump has a habit of weighing in on the day\u2019s most-covered news stories with his own running commentary.\n\nAs Dorian approached, Mr Trump switched into town-crier mode, updating the public on what he learned \u2014 or, what he thought he\u2019d learned \u2014 from government officials as Dorian threatened the coast of the state of Florida, where he has owned property for decades.\n\n\u201cIn addition to Florida \u2014 South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet shortly after departing Camp David for Washington on Sunday morning.\n\n\u201cLooking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nTrump attacks Will & Grace actress as hurricane sweeps in\n\nMr Trump\u2019s commentary on the hurricane was not wholly accurate. The National Weather Service quickly walked back one of his assertions: \u201cWe repeat, no impacts from Hurricane Dorian will be felt across Alabama,\u201d officials said on Twitter.\n\nAlways eager to have the last word, Mr Trump on Monday attacked an ABC reporter who said the president had wrongly inserted Alabama in the list of states.\n\n\u201cAlways good to be prepared!\u201d Mr Trump wrote by way of explanation.\n\nBut the president\u2019s concern for Florida, a state of political and personal importance to him, did not seem to waver going into the weekend. On Friday, he took questions from reporters about the ability of Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach estate, to withstand the winds.\n\n\u201cYeah, it would look like Mar-a-Lago is dead center,\u201d Mr Trump said. \u201cBut, look, Mar-a-Lago can handle itself. That\u2019s a very powerful place.\u201d\n\nAs Dorian grew in size and strength, Mr Trump appeared to marvel at the storm\u2019s sheer capacity for devastation: \u201cBeing hit like never before, Category 5. Almost 200 MPH winds,\u201d the president tweeted on Sunday.", "description": "Over the long weekend, President Donald Trump monitored Hurricane Dorian from a golf cart at his club in Virginia, calling for regular updates from an aide trailing him around the course.On Monday, as Dorian churned towards Florida and Trump\u2019s boarded-up Mar-a-Lago resort, the president had golfed twice", "authors": ["Katie Rogers"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/InraTOMusXpDwkm_g8ZJqg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/6bb21bf87cce06c4fa5e6e9cd6919ea3"}
