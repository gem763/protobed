The president maintained he had done nothing wrong.\n\nBiden referenced Trump\u2019s past claim that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York and get away with it.\n\nBiden said: \u201cIt\u2019s no joke. He\u2019s shooting holes in the constitution. And we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d\n\nNancy Pelosi, the House of Representatives speaker and the most powerful Democrat in Congress, announced an impeachment inquiry against Trump on 24 September after a whistleblower alleged the White House had attempted to cover up a July call between Trump and the Ukrainian president.\n\nAt issue is the question of whether Trump abused his office by using its power to his own political advantage, by pushing a Ukrainian investigation of Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claims that Biden exploited his influence as vice-president to aid his son or his business.\n\nBiden on Wednesday again condemned Trump\u2019s \u201clies and smears and distortion\u201d and said the president peddles them because he fears facing Biden in a general election.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to create a campaign where truth and facts are irrelevant,\u201d Biden said, adding that the spectacle covers the president\u2019s \u201cmanifest incompetence\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for president,\u201d Biden added. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let him get away with it. He\u2019s picked a fight with the wrong guy.\u201d\n\nWithout evidence, and contrary to the accounts of several Ukrainian officials, Trump has claimed Biden used his role as vice-president to protect his son from corruption investigations when he pressed for the firing of the top Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, during Obama\u2019s second term.\n\nUkrainian officials, including one Shokin successor, have disputed Trump\u2019s claims, and Biden has previously noted that the Obama administration\u2019s position was supported by many other western governments, who saw Shokin as incompetent or corrupt.\n\nMany of the other 19 Democratic 2020 candidates have long supported the opening of an impeachment inquiry into Trump, following the findings of Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference into the 2016 election and links between the Trump 2016 campaign and Moscow.\n\nBiden\u2019s speech on Wednesday came as his campaign continues internal deliberations over the best way to handle Trump\u2019s broadsides and an impeachment inquiry that could last months and potentially never result in the Republican-led Senate removing Trump from office \u2013 even if the Democratic-led House impeaches him.\n\n\u201cWhen I announced my candidacy,\u201d Biden recalled, \u201cI said I was running in order to restore the soul of America. That wasn\u2019t hyperbole.\u201d\n\nBut his advisers also point to the 2016 presidential campaign, when Trump dominated media narratives of the Republican primary and the general election against Hillary Clinton with a barrage of attacks on his opponents that forced them to campaign on his terms.\n\nBiden nodded at that reality, as well, and promised he won\u2019t let that get in his way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be distracted,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of these attacks are true, and I\u2019m going to stay focused on your lives. That\u2019s what this election is about,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Democratic 2020 contender says president is \u2018shooting holes in the constitution \u2013 we cannot let him get away with it\u2019", "authors": ["Joan E Greve", "Rebecca Solnit"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fc8fd399ad83bde5a8a24c4c5ae40ec11d24f60/0_161_4829_2897/master/4829.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=134228973fc6347fe9ced1390122f391", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
