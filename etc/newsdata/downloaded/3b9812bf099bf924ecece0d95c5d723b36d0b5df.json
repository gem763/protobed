REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nFlynn\u2019s lawyers lodged their objections to the government\u2019s conduct in a joint status report filed on Friday with the Washington, D.C., federal court.\n\nLawyers for the government countered that Flynn is ready for sentencing, perhaps as soon as Oct. 21. Both sides agreed that Flynn\u2019s cooperation with various government probes is finished.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations the prior December with Sergey Kislyak, who was Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, about U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow by President Barack Obama.\n\nThat plea came in connection with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s since-completed probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nFlynn\u2019s sentencing was originally scheduled for December 2018, and U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan will need to decide whether a further delay is warranted.\n\nCiting the status report, Sullivan scheduled a Sept. 10 conference to discuss the case.\n\nIn the report, Flynn\u2019s lawyer, Sidney Powell, said she has not had enough time to review the case, and accused the government of unfairly refusing to hand over information relevant to the defense.\n\nShe said this includes transcripts and recordings of phone calls supposedly underlying the charges against Flynn, and which the government has \u201csteadfastly refused to produce.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice countered that the government has \u201cexceeded\u201d its disclosure obligations, and was unaware of any classified information that Flynn needed to review.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed that Flynn be sentenced between Oct. 21 and 23 or between Nov. 1 and 15. Flynn\u2019s lawyers asked for 90 days before issuing of another status report.\n\nFlynn\u2019s discussions with Kislyak occurred in the run-up to Trump\u2019s January 2017 inauguration, after Flynn had worked on Trump\u2019s election campaign.\n\nIn connection with his plea, Flynn had been expected to testify at a trial last month against former business partner Bijan Rafiekian, who had been accused of secretly lobbying for Turkey.\n\nBut prosecutors called off Flynn\u2019s testimony on July 9, saying they instead planned to portray the retired U.S. Army lieutenant general as Rafiekian\u2019s co-conspirator. Rafiekian was convicted two weeks later.\n\nFlynn lasted three weeks as Trump\u2019s first national security adviser.", "description": "Lawyers for former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn accused the federal government of stalling their efforts to defend him, and said the former top aide to Donald Trump is not ready to be sentenced for lying about his discussions with a Russian ambassador.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424429164&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7T13M"}
