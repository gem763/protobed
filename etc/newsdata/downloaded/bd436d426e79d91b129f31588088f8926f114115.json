Infection can be prevented by vaccination.\n\nAn Indian child receives polio vaccine drops on National Immunisation Day in Guwahati in March\n\nA dramatic reduction in case numbers worldwide in recent decades has been largely due to intense national and regional immunisation campaigns in children.\n\nThe last case of polio type 3 was detected in northern Nigeria in 2012, and global health officials have since been conducting intense surveillance to ensure it has gone.\n\nThe Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) said in a statement today: 'With no wild poliovirus type 3 detected anywhere in the world since 2012, the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication is anticipated to officially declare this strain as globally eradicated.'\n\nThe success in ending type 3 means that only type 1 of the wild virus is still circulating and causing infections.\n\nPolio type 1 is endemic in two countries - Afghanistan and Pakistan - but efforts to wipe it out have faced setbacks in the past two years.\n\nAfter reaching a historic low of only 22 cases of wild polio infection in 2017, the virus has caused 72 cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan already this year.\n\nThe first target date for ending polio was set in 1988 by the GPEI, a partnership of the World Health Organization (WHO), the health charity Rotary International and others, which had aimed to eradicate it by 2000.\n\nGPEI said, however, that this week's declaration of the end of WPV3 was a 'significant milestone'.\n\nCarol Pandak, director of Rotary's PolioPlus program, said it proves that a polio-free world is achievable.\n\n'Even as the polio program addresses major challenges, we're making important headway in other areas,' she said.\n\nThe most recent outbreak of polio occurred in the Philippines in September, nearly two decades after it was declared free of the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease.\n\nHealth Secretary Francisco Duque III said today that authorities have confirmed at least one case of polio in a three-year-old girl in southern Lanao del Sur province.\n\nThey have also detected the polio virus in sewage in Manila and in waterways in the southern Davao region.\n\nThose findings are enough to declare an outbreak of the crippling disease in a previously polio-free country like the Philippines, he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund expressed deep concern over polio's reemergence in the country.", "description": "The fight to eradicate polio was given a major boost today as health officials announced wild polio virus type 3, also known as WPV3, had been wiped out.
