He offered condolences to the families of those who were killed and said the government was working to save people\u2019s lives and property.\n\n\u201cThe government will do everything in its power to cooperate with relevant agencies and operators working to restore services as soon as possible,\u201d Abe said. The government had also set up a task force to deal with the damage, NHK reported.\n\nSome 27,000 members of Japan\u2019s self-defense forces as well as firefighters, police and coast guard members were sent to rescue stranded people in central Japan\u2019s Nagano prefecture and elsewhere, the government said.\n\nNHK said the full extent of the widespread damage was only beginning to emerge because many areas remained under water.\n\nSome 425,000 homes were without power, the government said, reviving fears of a repeat of the weeks-long power outages suffered after another typhoon hit east of Tokyo last month.\n\nIn Fukushima, north of the capital, Tokyo Electric Power Co (9501.T) reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water in its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant overnight. The plant was crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nRelated Coverage Japan cancels maritime fleet review after typhoon: spokesman\n\nFLOODS, LANDSLIDES\n\nHagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu on Saturday evening and headed out to sea early on Sunday, leaving behind cloudless skies and high temperatures across the country.\n\nNHK showed fields and vast residential areas in parts of central and eastern Japan covered in brown water, with some of the worst damage caused by Chikuma river in Nagano prefecture.\n\nMilitary helicopters airlifted stranded people from homes near the river, some cradling their children, after they were trapped by water reaching the roofs of their houses.\n\nThe first floor of a large aged care home in Nagano city was shown under water.\n\nRescuers took residents from another flooded aged care facility by inflatable boats and carried them on their backs to safety. They also searched for survivors in homes destroyed in landslides near Tokyo\u2019s suburbs and in Fukushima prefecture, NHK showed.\n\nAuthorities at one point issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across Japan as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Close to 150 injuries have been reported so far, NHK said.\n\nThe storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm (37 inches) of rain over 24 hours.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency had issued the highest alert level for 12 prefectures, warning of the potential for once-in-decades rain totals, but lifted them early on Sunday.\n\nJust last month, another strong storm, Typhoon Faxai, destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses in Chiba, east of Tokyo, and caused extensive power outages.\n\nSlideshow (24 Images)\n\nThe Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada in Kamaishi on Sunday was canceled, although the crucial Japan-Scotland match was set to go ahead. Two matches were canceled on Saturday.\n\nFormula One Grand Prix organizers had also canceled all practice and qualifying sessions scheduled for Saturday.", "description": "Japan sent tens of thousands of troops and rescue workers on Sunday to save stranded residents and fight floods caused by one of the worst typhoons to hit the country in recent history, which killed 18 people and briefly paralyzed Tokyo.", "authors": ["Antoni Slodkowski", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440285918&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C05R", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
