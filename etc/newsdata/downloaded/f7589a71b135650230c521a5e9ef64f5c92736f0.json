Kanye West. Two of the biggest entertainers in popular culture have been drawing attention and sparking conversation about redemption and one\u2019s ability to evolve.\n\nComedy legend Murphy is in the midst of a comeback and, as he readies a highly-anticipated Netflix film (Dolemite Is My Name), a big-budget sequel to his most beloved classic (Coming 2 America), and a reported return to stand-up, he\u2019s looked back over his past as a comic and put it in contemporary perspective. During a sit-down with The New York Times, Murphy was critical of the hateful quotes he\u2019d spewed for yuks in his younger days\u2014most infamously his jokes about AIDS, the gay community, and women.\n\n\u201cI was a young guy processing a broken heart, you know, kind of an asshole,\u201d he said of his hit 1987 concert film Raw. \u201cI now have a whole lifetime of experiences to draw upon.\u201d\n\nEddie\u2019s stand-up classics are famously gut-wrenching and cringe-inducing in equal measure. For every quotable line about ice cream trucks and Mr. T, there\u2019s a hateful barb toward gays and women. The ickier parts of Raw and his 1983 HBO special Delirious have been pored over for decades. Murphy himself even admitted how wrong he\u2019d been back in 1996, when he first apologized for his cracks about AIDS.\n\n\u201cI deeply regret any pain all this has caused. Just like the rest of the world, I am more educated about AIDS in 1996 than I was in 1981,\u201d Murphy said in \u201896. \u201cI know how serious an issue AIDS is the world over. I know that AIDS isn\u2019t funny. It\u2019s 1996 and I\u2019m a lot smarter about AIDS now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not homophobic and I am not anti-gay,\u201d he continued. \u201cMy wife and I have donated both time and money to AIDS research. I\u2019ve had people close to me die from the disease as well. I don\u2019t know a person who hasn\u2019t been touched in some way by this disease. Everybody knows somebody who is sick. Black people have been hit harder by this disease than any other group of people on the planet.\u201d\n\nBut this week, when Murphy admitted that his old stuff is hard to watch, some people viewed it as a retreat. On the heels of heated debates surrounding comedians like Dave Chappelle and erstwhile Saturday Night Live newbie Shane Gillis, and criticism of \u201ccancel culture\u201d from Joker director Todd Phillips, Murphy\u2019s statements were treated as bending the knee for the sake of public opinion. The criticism suggests that what Murphy has said about his \u201880s material is cowardly, but what person in their fifties doesn\u2019t look back on their twenties and see how young and dumb they were?\n\nAnd what\u2019s more cowardly than not admitting when you were wrong?\n\nKanye West has been on a different kind of path. The entertainer has referenced a move to religiosity for a while (and his music has been peppered with religious references from \u201cJesus Walks\u201d to \u201cI Am a God\u201d), but this year is when he actually seemed to make the leap. In the spring, he began hosting his \u201cSunday Services,\u201d which featured the rapper performing gospel-fied versions of his hits for attendees every Sunday\u2014culminating in an Easter service at Coachella. He\u2019s promised a forthcoming duo of albums\u2014a project called Yandhi and the hotly anticipated Jesus Is King\u2014and an IMAX film event also called Jesus Is King due in late October that documents his much-publicized Sunday Services. Kanye\u2019s services have featured West performing with choirs at churches around the country and have been attended by everyone from Brad Pitt to DMX. The stated goal of the shows has been to \u201ccommunicate love effectively,\u201d but some commentators have been left cold, dismissive or skeptically intrigued by the ostentatious display and star power amongst attendees. Okayplayer called the shows \u201chim embarking in a religious aesthetic that, even in its sincerity, is just provocative and unsettling enough to fit West\u2019s subversive persona.\u201d\n\nAfter reports of walkouts at his Sunday Service in Queens, New York, the New York Post ran a piece that featured some Christians\u2019 criticisms of West\u2019s services. \u201cHe may be trying to understand Jesus in his own limited way and we cannot judge another\u2019s soul,\u201d said Kaleina, a 68-year-old commercial real estate professional. \u201cPeople who follow Christ sense something is not right with this scene.\u201d\n\n\u201c There is no apology or contrition, really. He just knows that his popularity is so massive that he can reshape his public image no matter how reckless his rhetoric. \u201d\n\nKanye\u2019s church services are the latest in the endless pomp and pretentiousness that has been his hallmark for more than a decade. He\u2019s become almost solely an architect of spectacle\u2014as evidenced by the fact that the services have drawn so much attention for an album he has yet to deliver\u2014with his music serving as an appendage to his ability to get all eyes on him. That facet of who he is makes this particular endeavor less about redemption and more about affirming the kind of sway he holds over the populace. There is no apology or contrition, really. He just knows that his popularity is so massive that he can reshape his public image no matter how reckless his rhetoric.\n\nWith Murphy, on the other hand, his current reflections on his past homophobia and misogyny convey a man looking back at who he was as a youth and acknowledging his mistakes, indicative of the past few decades of growth. Anyone who has been around long enough to have regrets can understand wanting to be better than you once were, and it\u2019s cynical to characterize his recent statements as simply a calculated ploy to engender favor during what is ostensibly a pop-culture comeback. In the case of Kanye West, his semi-rebranding as an evangelical comes with no such reflectiveness; it feels like the latest episode of a bizarre show that we\u2019ve been incapable of looking away from for the better part of his career.\n\nPeople have embraced Murphy\u2019s statements, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. Change for the better should be applauded and black men don\u2019t get very many shots at redemption in America. And many have pondered across social media why is there so much cynicism directed at Kanye West when he\u2019s embracing and promoting his faith. Throughout 2018, West was embracing and promoting Donald Trump, uttering woefully ignorant statements like \u201cslavery was a choice,\u201d and seemingly antagonistic to the black fan base that made him and the community from whence he\u2019d come. With so much talk of forgiveness, it\u2019s not hard to see why people may have been reluctant to offer clemency to West in the court of public opinion. It\u2019s hard to forgive Kanye West when ICE is still raiding homes. It\u2019s hard to forgive Kanye West when MAGA hats so often accompany hate. But, perhaps most significantly, it\u2019s hard to forgive Kanye West when he hasn\u2019t done anything to warrant it.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t even asked for forgiveness.", "description": "While Murphy has acknowledged his past mistakes and exhibited personal growth, West has gone a very different route toward currying public favor.", "authors": ["Stereo Williams"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570326022/191002-stereo-eddie-murphy-kanye-tease_sd4i0x", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
