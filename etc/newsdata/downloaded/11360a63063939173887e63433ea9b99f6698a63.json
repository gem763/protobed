It\u2019s that time of year where our minds turn from the fresh, sea-breeze scents of summer to the homely, hibernating fragrances of autumn.\n\nWe\u2019ve picked our favourite seasonal candles to make your space cosy and inviting, paying special attention to how well the scent diffused throughout the room, and how long it lingered after the candle had been extinguished.\n\nBurn your candle for two-four hours, until the wax has melted in an even pool the whole way across; this will help your candle last for longer and also burn down evenly, so you won\u2019t be left with wasted wax up the sides of the jar.\n\nIf you find the glass becomes sooty, try trimming the wick a little between each burn.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

It\u2019s a light, everyday kind of scent, with notes of tea, strawberry, mint and rose; there\u2019s not much better to burn while enjoying a cuppa. The scent is potent but not overpowering, and diffuses quickly around the room.\n\nBurn time: 50 hours\n\nBuy now\n\nPF Candle Co apple picking: \u00a322, The Little Deer\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get much more autumnal than apple picking. This has a spicy, warm, mulled cider-like fragrance \u2013 we get nutmeg and orange notes \u2013 that reminds us of damp leaves underfoot. We found we got more from the scent when we burned it in an enclosed space, such as a bedroom, rather than an open-plan living area.\n\nBurn time: 40-50 hours\n\nBuy now\n\nLaboratory Perfumes tonka scented candle: \u00a345, Laboratory Perfumes\n\nSweet vanilla-y tonka bean, mandarin and pink peppercorns make for an earthy, spicy scent that\u2019s properly cosy and gives us Christmas vibes without the usual OTT cinnamon and orange. It\u2019s also one of the longest lasting scents we tried, lingering for hours after the candle had been blown out.\n\nBurn time: 40 hours\n\nBuy now\n\nBoy Smells cedar stack: \u00a335, Selfridges\n\nThis is a proper woody, smoky scent, with tobacco, pepper and cedarwood notes, but elevated and accentuated by juniper and white musk. The result is a slightly more feminine, sweeter take on the log fire candle. The scent fills the room within 20 minutes of lighting.\n\nBurn time: 55 hours\n\nBuy now\n\nEym rest: \u00a339, Eym\n\nWe love Eym\u2019s gorgeous minimalist designs, which will suit any interior-loving candle fan. Rest is the most therapeutic-feeling candle we smelled, with sweet orange, chamomile and lavender oils creating a soothing, calming scent. It\u2019s perfect for bathtime. Eym candles are non-toxic and don\u2019t have a chemical booster, so burn for two-three hours for best effect.\n\nBurn time: 50 hours\n\nBuy now\n\nByredo chai: \u00a357, Byredo\n\nThis candle was inspired by brand founder Ben Gorham\u2019s childhood trips to India, and has the spiciness and the comforting creaminess that you'd expect from a scent called chai. Plus there\u2019s not much that\u2019s better than Byredo\u2019s chic black glass packaging.\n\nBurn time: 60 hours\n\nBuy now\n\nOverose valkiria: \u00a346, Cult Beauty\n\nThis isn\u2019t an obvious entry for an autumn candles roundup \u2013 Overose describes it as \u201csummer but better\u201d, after all \u2013 but it transports us back to hot days with its ripe, figgy, milky scent, and makes us feel warmer by association. Overose candles are some of the most potent we\u2019ve tried; we can smell them even when they\u2019re not burning.\n\nBurn time: 60 hours\n\nBuy now\n\n& Other Stories bryggeriet: \u00a317, & Other Stories\n\nWe were always going to love this one as it\u2019s named after a Swedish brewery \u2013 the Stockholm offices of the brand were formerly the premises where St Erik was brewed. Bryggeriet is a spicy, woody scent, with cardamom, sandalwood and suede, perfect for cosying up on autumnal nights.\n\nBurn time: 45 hours\n\nBuy now\n\nDiptyque ambre: \u00a362, Diptyque\n\nNever mind the scent, the rich reddy brown of this jar looks like autumn. Ambre is a rich, sophisticated blend of woods, balms and resins that somehow manages to be both earthy and outdoorsy and warm and comforting. It\u2019s the candle equivalent of a blanket. Of all the candles we tried, this was the one with the longest-lingering scent \u2013 it could even be smelled outside our flat.\n\nBurn time: 60 hours\n\nBuy now\n\nDS & Durga Rama won\u2019t you please come home: \u00a360, Osmology\n\nBrooklyn-based DS & Durga takes an experiential approach to scent, building its fragrances around evocative memories or images, such as \u201cportable fireplace\u201d and \u201c85 diesel\u201d. The new \u201cRama won\u2019t you please come home\u201d conjures north India, Diwali and the story of the titular Hindu god Rama. It is a floral, earthy and subtly exotic scent, with teak, gardenia, sandalwood, tree flowers and tuberose. It\u2019s a subtle scent but perceptible almost immediately after lighting, and lingers in a room long after the flame has been extinguished.\n\nBurn time: 60 hours\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Autumn candles\n\nBoy Smells' cedar stack is an unusual, slightly sweeter take on the classic smoky candle that brings the outside in, while Eym's rest is perfect for a relaxing, cosy evening.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
