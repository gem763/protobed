[Photo/IC]\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats in Congress, answering Republican complaints that their impeachment investigation of US President Donald Trump is being conducted in secret, plan a vote on Thursday on a format for going public with their inquiry.\n\nTrump and his fellow Republicans have for weeks branded as illegitimate the work of committees probing Trump's overtures to Ukraine, arguing the full Democratic-led House of Representatives had failed to authorize their investigations in a public vote.\n\nMeeting behind closed doors, the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees have been looking into the possibility that Trump violated federal law by seeking foreign help for his November 2020 re-election efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, House Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern said on Monday: \"I will be introducing a resolution to ensure transparency and provide a clear path forward.\"\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in a statement that the legislation would establish \"a format for open hearings.\" The US Constitution gives the House broad authority to set ground rules for an impeachment inquiry, and Democrats say they are following House rules on investigations.\n\nSeveral administration officials, including a former deputy national security adviser on Monday, have failed to testify to House committees engaged in the probe.\n\nIn a letter to her fellow House Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will vote this Thursday, according to a senior Democratic aide, on a resolution that spells out how future public hearings will be held.\n\nPelosi promised to provide legal protections for Trump.\n\nA source familiar with the probe said the public hearings will be held by the Intelligence Committee and that the transcripts from closed depositions with witnesses will be made public. A senior House Democratic aide said the hearings could begin within the next month.\n\nThe measure will set the stage for House investigating committees to forward evidence they have collected to the House Judiciary Committee, which then would decide whether to advance articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nEven if the House impeaches Trump, he would face a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, which for the moment seems unlikely to convict the president and force his ouster.\n\nImpeachment requires a simple majority in the 435-member House, but conviction demands the support of a two-thirds majority in the 100-member Senate.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to ousted national security adviser John Bolton, failed to appear before the three House panels conducting the Ukraine phase of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, lawmakers said.\n\nOther panels are probing separate issues, including Trump's finances and whether White House security clearances were abused.\n\nKupperman put off testifying while asking a court to rule on whether he should comply with a congressional subpoena or honor the Trump administration's order not to testify, his lawyers said last week.\n\nDemocrats in turn said they would not let further legal maneuverings delay their work.\n\nAt least nine others have testified despite being instructed by the White House not to do so, Schiff said.\n\nKupperman was expected to provide testimony about Trump's dealings with Ukraine brought to Congress' attention by a report from a whistleblower about a July 25 telephone call between the US president and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nTrump's request to Zelenskiy that he investigate former US vice-president Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, is the focus of the inquiry being conducted by the three panels.\n\nTrump made his request after withholding $391 million in security aid approved by the US Congress to help fight Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nTrump again dismissed the inquiry in comments to reporters.\n\n\"I had a great conversation with the Ukrainian president. I had another with him also, I think before that, which was the same thing, it was nothing. They tried to take that conversation and make it into a big scandal,\" Trump said on Monday.\n\nREUTERS", "description": "Democrats in Congress, answering Republican complaints that their impeachment investigation of US President Donald Trump is being conducted in secret, plan a vote on Thursday on a format for going public with their inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/29/5db85043a310cf3e97a3734f.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
