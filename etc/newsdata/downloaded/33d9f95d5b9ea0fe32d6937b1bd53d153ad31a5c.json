It is unlikely to happen soon\n\nWhen he made history in Austria on Saturday morning, Eliud Kipchoge, the first person to run a marathon in less than two hours, was quick to refer to another jaw-dropping athletic milestone reached more than 50 years ago.\n\nFaster, harder, stronger \u2026 is there no limit to what humans can do? Read more\n\nAmid jubilant scenes in Prater park, Vienna, the 34-year-old Kenyan declared: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. After Roger Bannister made history, it took me another 65 years. I\u2019ve tried but I\u2019ve done it.\u201d\n\nThroughout the attempt, he had stuck to a pace of 2min 50sec per kilometre \u2013 the equivalent, as many later pointed out on social media, to running 100m in 17.2 seconds, 422 times.\n\nHe hit the one-hour mark with 11 seconds to spare and, with 500m to go, burst clear of his support team to break the hallowed two-hour barrier, punching his chest twice in celebration.\n\nAs he sprinted towards the finish line, where his wife, Grace Sugutt, was waiting to greet him, Kipchoge waved to the crowds. Upon breaking the tape he grabbed a Kenyan flag and was mobbed by his support crew.\n\nEliud Kipchoge's sub two-hour marathon \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nIn characteristically modest style, he said afterwards: \u201cThis shows no one is limited. Now I\u2019ve done it, I am expecting more people to do it after me.\u201d\n\nBannister\u2019s record was broken just weeks after he ran his sub four-minute mile. But any expectation that Kipchoge\u2019s crown will be claimed imminently seems unlikely, at least in the short term.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a while before anybody else breaks two again,\u201d said Andrew Jones, a professor of sport and health sciences at the University of Exeter, pointing out that Kipchoge ran on a special course using pacemakers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely to be replicated in a major city marathon so you\u2019d need another specific situation to be created to make another attempt.\u201d\n\nKipchoge\u2019s extraordinary, superhuman feat seemed the stuff of fantasy only a few years ago. An article published in 2010 on the Science of Sport website suggested that the world would have \u201c80 years to wait for the two-hour marathon\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, Kipchoge had tried to dip under two hours at the Formula One track in Monza, Italy, as part of Nike\u2019s Breaking 2 project, but missed out then by just 26 seconds.\n\nHe had been joined by two other elite runners - Ethiopia\u2019s Lelisa Desisa and Zersenay Tadese, of Eritrea - who both finished well off the pace.\n\nThis time, for the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, Kipchoge was on his own, confirmation that few can rival him.\n\nJones, an adviser on the Breaking 2 project, said Kipchoge\u2019s achievement could \u201creset the psychological framework for everybody else\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think it will now be more common to see people running 2:02 or 2:01 and, more importantly, for the youngsters in Ethiopia and Kenya and elsewhere - it\u2019s reset what\u2019s possible. For them, 1:59 is the new status quo.\u201d\n\nThe man behind the attempt, the INneos chief, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, paid tribute to how Kipchoge finished: \u201cThat last kilometre where he actually accelerated was superhuman. He ran the first half marathon in under an hour and then he had to do it again.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:04 Eliud Kipchoge crosses the finish line in first-ever sub two-hour marathon \u2013 video\n\nThe conditions in Prater park were perfect. Almost pancake-flat, the 9.6km course, which Kipchoge completed more than four times, boasted long straights, protected from the wind by high trees.\n\nThe achievement will not be recognised as an official marathon world record as it was not run in open competition. Nevertheless, Kipchoge\u2019s place in the history books is assured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing, what he has achieved today,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly the outstanding endurance athlete of our generation, possibly any generation.\u201d\n\nSports stars from around the world were awestruck by the achievement.\n\nThe British sprinter Adam Gemili declared on Twitter: \u201cTruly inspirational. Sub 2 hour marathon. So blessed to have witnessed that. History!\u201d The England rugby star Maro Itoje described it as \u201cincredible\u201d.\n\nKipchoge, who has won 10 of his 11 marathons and holds the official world record marathon time of 2:01:39, appeared overwhelmed by the reaction.\n\nAn hour after forcing the world to reconsider what was humanly possible, the four-time London marathon winner posted on Twitter: \u201cToday we went to the Moon and came back to earth! I am at a loss for words for all the support I have received from all over the world. Thank you to all who gave me the opportunity. Asante.\u201d\n\nGame changers\n\nSir Roger Bannister is the first person to run a sub four-minute mile, in 3min 59.4sec (6 May 1954).\n\nBob Beamon breaks the long-jump record by 55cm (October 18 1968).\n\nNadia Com\u0103neci, 14, is the first gymnast awarded a perfect 10 (18 July 1976).\n\nJavier Sotomayor sets the high-jump record: 2.45m (27 July1993).", "description": "After redefining \u2018humanly possible\u2019, the runner said his time would be beaten.
