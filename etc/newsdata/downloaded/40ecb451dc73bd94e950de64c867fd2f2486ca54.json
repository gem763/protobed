Finds 38 People Committed Violations", "language": "en", "text": "The U.S. State Department concluded its investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email usage and determined nearly 40 people committed violations, the Associated Press reported Friday.\n\nThe department determined that those 38 people were \u201cculpable\u201d in 91 cases of sending classified information in messages that ended up in Clinton\u2019s personal email. The 38 are current and former State Department officials but were not identified in the report that was sent to Congress this week.\n\nThe investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified, but could not assign fault in 497 cases.\n\nThe development follows reports that the State Department had widened its inquiry into Clinton\u2019s private email server usage, with investigators questioning numerous aides of the Obama-era official in the past month.\n\nSome former Obama administration officials have attempted to discredit the investigation by accusing the Trump administration of targeting them. However, one current official retorted that \u201cthe process is set up in a manner to completely avoid any appearance of political bias.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with who is in the White House,\u201d another official affirmed to the Washington Post. \u201cThis is about the time it took to go through millions of emails, which is about three and a half years.\u201d\n\nA Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) review of Clinton\u2019s server found over 100 emails contained classified information, including 65 emails deemed \u201cSecret\u201d and 22 considered \u201cTop Secret.\u201d In addition, 2,093 emails, which were not labeled classified, were retroactively classified by the State Department.\n\nSeveral experts have argued Clinton broke multiple laws, including 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1924, which forbids \u201cunauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material.\u201d\n\nYet, the FBI ruled in July 2016 that Clinton did not commit any crimes, despite characterizing her private email usage as \u201creckless.\u201d Then-FBI Director James Comey infamously drafted a statement exonerating Clinton prior to the investigation\u2019s completion.\n\nDepartment of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz issued a stinging rebuke of the FBI\u2019s handling of the investigation in June 2018, writing that Comey\u2019s conduct during the probe as \u201cinsubordinate.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The State Department concluded an investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s private email usage.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/hillary-huma.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
