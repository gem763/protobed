These account for 3.2% of projects in the graveyard, with an average lifespan of 1.4 years.\n\nSource: Cointopsy via Longhash\n\nAs Longhash notes, quantifying the number of dead cryptocurrencies is a thorny matter, given that much of the data is crowdsourced and also the fact there is little consensus over how to define well and truly \u201cdead.\u201d\n\nCointopsy reportedly lists 705 deceased projects, DeadCoins lists 1,779, and CoinMarketCap includes over 1,000 projects with less than USD $1,000 per day in trading volume \u2014 arguably dying, if not absolutely lifeless.\n\nThis summer, Cointelegraph published an article devoted to cryptocurrencies presumed dead, finding the causes of death to include low liquidity, theft, lack of utility and management feuds.", "description": "Blockchain education platform Longhash has analyzed data from crowd-sourced sites to assess why certain cryptocurrency projects have wound up in the industry\u2019s...", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZTFkY2M1ZjVkOTMxNjAyYjMxZmJmMWFkOTlkOGVlNTkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
