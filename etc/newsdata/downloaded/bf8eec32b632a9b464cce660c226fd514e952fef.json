REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\n\nBanks, insurers and asset managers have spent the last three years moving operations to Dublin and other financial centers like Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Luxembourg to ensure they keep servicing clients in the EU\u2019s single market after Brexit.\n\nIreland\u2019s central bank had said at the end of January that it had processed more than half of its 100-plus applications, meaning a relatively small number are still outstanding before Britain\u2019s scheduled departure from the bloc next month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well over 100 authorizations or authorizations in principle where we\u2019ve said you\u2019re authorized subject to certain conditions, for instance putting capital in,\u201d Sibley told Reuters in an interview at the central bank\u2019s headquarters.\n\n\u201cWe still have a number of applications that are in train, many will be completed before Oct. 31, some won\u2019t... If they\u2019re not authorized, they\u2019re not authorized and we would expect them not to be taking authorized business.\u201d\n\nSibley said most larger entities \u2014 which include Barclays (BARC.L) and Bank of America (BAC.N) who have set up EU headquarters in the Irish capital \u2014 are pretty much all approved, with \u201cmaybe one or two exceptions\u201d.\n\nEven with the influx, Sibley said he was confident no-deal preparations were in place across Ireland\u2019s varied international financial services sector and that the system as a whole is robust enough to cope if Britain leaves without the cushion of a divorce agreement and a transition period.\n\nIreland is considered the remaining EU member most exposed to such an outcome, from the implications for its currently seamless border with British-run Northern Ireland to tightly intertwined trade with its nearest neighbor.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at it is, given the kind of macro, political, societal impacts of Brexit on Ireland, it\u2019s really important that the financial services system a) isn\u2019t adding to the woes and b) continues to be there to support the business and the people who will require support after Oct. 31,\u201d Sibley said.\n\n\u201cSo from a system wide level, the shock will be significant enough but manageable.\u201d\n\nHe said Ireland\u2019s retail banks \u2014 which required the euro zone\u2019s most expensive bailout after the 2008-09 financial crisis \u2014 were far more resilient a decade later from a funding governance, control and risk management perspective.\n\nRelated Coverage Interview with Irish Deputy Central Bank Governor Ed Sibley\n\nRegulators are pretty confident the banks will be ready operationally, he said, but an unruly Brexit will hurt a sector now almost wholly focused on the domestic market.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be concerned that we will have an overnight problem, it isn\u2019t going to cause a massive financial stability problem. But it will be difficult for them, it will be damaging for the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nSibley added that he has not seen any evidence to suggest changes were required in an upcoming annual review of the central bank\u2019s mortgage lending limits, one of the measures put in place in recent years to increase that resilience.", "description": "Well over 100 financial-services firms that applied to set up or extend operations in Ireland because of Britain's plans to quit the European Union have been authorized to do so by the Irish central bank, deputy governor Ed Sibley said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Padraic Halpin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425505444&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811K2"}
