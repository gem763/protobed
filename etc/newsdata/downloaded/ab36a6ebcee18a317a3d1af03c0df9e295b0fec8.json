REUTERS/Jorge Luis Plata\n\nThe suspects were nabbed by security forces in a central district of the capital on Tuesday after authorities seized two laboratories used to produce synthetic drugs, 50 kg (110 pounds) of chemical precursors, more than two tons of marijuana and 20 kg of cocaine, as well as an unspecified amount of money, rocket launchers and grenades.\n\nLopez Obrador, speaking at his regular morning press conference, said the unexpected release of the criminal suspects would be investigated but cautioned against a rush to judgment.\n\n\u201cHere the important thing is to see what the arguments were that were used to release these people,\u201d said the leftist leader, who took office in December. \u201cLet\u2019s not rush. If someone acted improperly, illegally, if there was corruption, we will condemn it,\u201d he said.\n\nWith homicides on track to hit an all-time high this year and following the bungled arrest last week of a notorious drug lord\u2019s son, Lopez Obrador\u2019s approach to security has come under increasing scrutiny.\n\nSinaloa Cartel gunmen on Oct. 17 overwhelmed security forces who had detained one of the sons of jailed drug kingpin Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman in the northwestern city of Culiacan, forcing the release of the son and prompting a public outcry.\n\nIn his comments Friday, Lopez Obrador said police were under-trained and had been ineffective in putting together case files, and gathering all the evidence needed to keep suspected criminals behind bars.\n\n\u201cThe case files are wrongly put together and this lets judges say \u2018This is wrong, there isn\u2019t enough evidence, there are contradictions\u2019 and then they go free,\u201d he said.\n\nHe did not elaborate, and the circumstances surrounding the release of the suspects believed to belong to the Tepito Union cartel, including the identity of the judge who handled their case and when they were allowed to walk free, were not immediately known.\n\nA judicial reform, approved by Congress in 2008 and implemented in 2016 under the administration of Lopez Obrador\u2019s predecessor, requires police to present more evidence for arrests.\n\nThe reform sought to modernize the judicial system by ending closed-doors trials and implementing public proceedings where prosecutors and defenders present evidence.\n\nLopez Obrador said security officials need to be \u201cbetter trained\u201d and that judges must be \u201chonest, incorruptible.\u201d", "description": "Twenty-seven of 31 suspected cartel members arrested this week in a Mexico City raid were freed by a judge, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday, marking his government's second high-profile failure to keep suspected criminals locked up in as many weeks.", "authors": ["Anthony Esposito", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1445014093&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1UD", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
