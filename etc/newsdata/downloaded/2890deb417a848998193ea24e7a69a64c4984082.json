Mandatory Credit: Raj Mehta-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDetroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford became the fastest player to reach 40,000 NFL career passing yards on Sunday.\n\nHe entered the game against the Minnesota Vikings needing 87 yards to hit the milestone and eclipsed it on a 36-yard completion to wideout Danny Amendola in the first quarter.\n\nThe previous record holder, Matt Ryan of the Atlanta Falcons, did it in his 151st game. Sunday\u2019s game was the 147th of Stafford\u2019s career.\n\nStafford, 31, also was the fastest to hit other milestones: 15,000, 20,000, 25,000 and 30,000. He entered the game No. 21 on the NFL\u2019s all-time passing list, trailing Johnny Unitas by 326 yards.\n\nTalking to reporters earlier in the week, Stafford seemed unfazed by the 40,000-yard mark.\n\n\u201cI hope 40,000 isn\u2019t the last number I hit,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep playing and play well. The biggest thing for me is I just want to get the bad taste out of my mouth of losing two in a row. I just want to win a game.\n\n\u201cIf I throw for 86 and we win, I\u2019ll be happy as hell.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford became the fastest player to reach 40,000 NFL career passing yards on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443096036&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0NJ-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
