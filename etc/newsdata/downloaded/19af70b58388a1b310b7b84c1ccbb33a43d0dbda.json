Only 45% of registered voters took part, compared to 63% in 2014, official figures showed.\n\nHowever, the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, a partner in recent coalition governments, said its count, to be announced at a news conference later, was different to that released in exit polls.\n\nA party official, speaking anonymously, said the race was between Karoui, Saied and the Ennahda candidate Abdelfatah Mourou.\n\nTunisia\u2019s prime minister, two former prime ministers, a former president and the defense minister were also among the 26 candidates on the ballot.\n\n\u201cThis is an impressive win that shows Tunisians want to cut the old system and want to see a leader who is like them... it is a lesson for the rulers,\u201d said Samira Chaouachi, an official in Karoui\u2019s party.\n\nA court on Friday ruled that he must stay in detention after his arrest last month on three-year-old charges brought by a transparency watchdog for tax evasion and money laundering.\n\nHe denies wrongdoing and his supporters say the timing of his arrest showed the establishment was trying to silence him. His critics accuse him of illicitly using his unlicensed television station and his charity as campaign tools.\n\nSaied, a conservative constitutional law professor, is also a political newcomer. In the televised debates shown over consecutive nights last week, he expressed support for the death penalty and opposition to equal inheritance rights between men and women.\n\nWith no real political machine or publicity campaign, Saied has appealed to Tunisians in television appearances speaking in a highly correct form of Arabic devoid of the colloquial expressions used by most of his compatriots.\n\nThe simplicity of his campaign may also have strengthened his credentials as a crusader against the corruption which many Tunisians believe has bedeviled their transition to democracy.\n\nPresidential candidate Kais Saied is pictured after unofficial results of the Tunisian presidential election in Tunis, Tunisia, September 15, 2019.

In the poor Ettadamen district, Mouaz Chneifiya, a 42-year-old unemployed man, was sitting in a cafe and said he would not vote.\n\n\u201cSince the election we\u2019ve been getting promises and nothing is done on the ground, so why vote? The elections will end and the promises will be dropped as soon as they get into office like in past elections,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the central Lafayette district of Tunis, dozens of people stood patiently queuing in the Rue de l\u2019Inde primary school in a whitewashed stucco courtyard under sky blue wooden shutters.\n\nKholoud Alwi, 27, said none of the candidates had convinced her. \u201cBut I have to vote. It\u2019s important for the country,\u201d she said.\n\nCROWDED FIELD\n\nThe election was brought forward after the death in July of the incumbent Beji Caid Essebsi.\n\nTunisia\u2019s president has direct control over foreign and defense policy while most other portfolios are handled by a prime minister chosen by parliament, for which an election will be held on October 6.\n\nWith that limited role, many candidates have emphasized their policies on security - an area in which Tunisia has improved since two jihadist attacks in 2015 killed scores of tourists, devastating the country\u2019s tourism sector.\n\nA pair of armed soldiers stood outside each polling station Reuters visited.\n\nDespite economic frustrations, many voters said they were proud of Tunisia\u2019s march to democracy.\n\nSlideshow (29 Images)\n\nOutside the capital, in the village of Sidi Thabet, six middle-aged men sat debating the merits of rival campaigns in a field under the shade of a gum tree, having pulled chairs over from the cafe opposite.\n\nThey each had the inky forefinger that showed they had voted, and were united in concern at the poor level of public services in a local economy based on growing olives, vegetables and fruit, though they supported different candidates.", "description": "Two political outsiders said they believed they had advanced to the second round of Tunisia's presidential election on Sunday, citing exit polls, though no official results have been announced.", "authors": ["Tarek Amara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430219492&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0QY", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
