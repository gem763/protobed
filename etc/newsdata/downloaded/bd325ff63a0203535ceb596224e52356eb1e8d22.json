The national legislature used its constitutional powers to appoint Guaid\u00f3 interim president in January in response to Maduro refusing to hand the presidency over.\n\nThe move was recognized by both the U.S. and the majority of Western nations, who accepted that the Maduro regime had rigged the 2018 presidential election and had no legitimate claim to power.\n\n\u201cThis Member of Congress is an imperial puppet. He does not exist in Venezuelan politics,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is a criminal element who has been introduced to breach the peace in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis self-proclamation was followed by recognition by a majority of governments of this unequal world; perhaps one of the worst mistakes in the diplomatic history of these countries,\u201d she argued.\n\nThe 50-year-old leftist, subject to multiple sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, also attacked \u201ca new kind of terrorism,\u201d which allegedly does not use force but, instead, \u201cthe dominance of the dollar\u201d and thus \u201cenforce[s] doctrines of regime change \u2026 to steal the resources of nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cEconomic terrorism against Venezuela has caused a nine-fold drop in its income,\u201d she declared. \u201cBetween 2015 and 2018, the total losses for the Venezuelan economy reached $130 billion because of the brutal blockade imposed by the United States, which is a shameless robbery of all our resources.\u201d\n\nRodr\u00edguez\u2019s tacit admission of the power of the U.S. dollar is surprising given of her past criticisms of the currency. Last year, she warned that the dollar \u201cdoes not exist\u201d and had become a ticking time bomb as it was built on financial speculation rather than real wealth.\n\n\u201cVenezuela has already entered the new international financial order, the dollar does not exist, it has no real financial basis, it is speculative, and it represents the financial crisis of world capitalism,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nRodr\u00edguez\u2019s comments are all the more extraordinary given Venezuela\u2019s current economic predicament in which hyperinflation and economic decline have rendered its bol\u00edvar currency practically worthless and led to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis that has led to at least four million people fleeing the country in recent years.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez denounced Juan Guaid\u00f3 as an \"imperial puppet\" who does not even \"exist in Venezuelan politics.\"", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Delcy-Rodriguez-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
