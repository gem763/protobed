In The Complete Guide to Bodyweight Training, the sports therapist Kesh Patel defines it as lifting weights in \u201csmaller, but frequent chunks, rather than one large one.\u201d On Instagram, people tag everything from yoga poses to 100-pound deadlifts with #greasethegroove. (The term is, helpfully, both sciencey and sexy sounding.)\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say for certain why it has gained popularity,\u201d said Christopher J. Lundstrom, a professor of exercise science at the University of Minnesota, in an email, \u201cbut I suspect it has to do with the simplicity of the idea, and the fact that it does not require a particularly hard effort (i.e., it doesn\u2019t hurt) and often requires little to no equipment.\u201d\n\nIn fact, greasing the groove has become something of a catchphrase for people who don\u2019t have the time or ability to do a full workout, but still want to squeeze in a little exercise. \u201cSome days your daily routine is better than others but the key is consistency and #greasingthegroove,\u201d one yogis\u2019s Instagram caption says. The practice appears to have taken on a Michael Pollan\u2013esque definition: Lift weight, not too much, most of the days. For busy people who just want to squeeze in fitness however they can, that might be just the right mantra.\n\nRead: The futility of the workout-sit cycle\n\nOne way to grease the groove is to just do the exercise whenever you think of it. Ben Greenfield, in Beyond Training, describes how he would do three to five pull-ups every time he walked under a pull-up bar installed in his office doorway. By the end of the day, he\u2019d have performed 30 to 50 pull-ups with minimal effort.\n\nMcKay opted for something similar: He set up a pull-up bar in his door frame, and every time he walked under it, he would do one. \u201cYou\u2019re allowing yourself to practice more without going to fatigue,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re constantly thrashing your body, doing max sets every time you do a pull-up, you\u2019re gonna have a bad time.\u201d Anyone who has tried to climb the stairs to their apartment on achy quads after an ambitious leg day knows the risks of overexertion. Within a month, McKay says, he went from being able to do about five pull-ups to about 15.\n\nKevin Weaver, a professor of physical therapy at New York University, told me that training by greasing the groove can help your body increase the number of muscle fibers it uses to perform a certain action. Brad Schoenfeld, an associate professor of exercise science at CUNY\u2019s Lehman College, also sees a potential benefit. Because of how the brain learns, he says, doing four sets of an exercise over five days rather than 20 sets in one day, for instance, might be a way to improve technique or form, which could result in getting stronger even if you don\u2019t add additional weight. This would be especially helpful for more complex exercises, like certain kettlebell moves.", "description": "Have you ever tried to grease the groove?", "authors": ["Olga Khazan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_1053278366/facebook.jpg?1569480020", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
