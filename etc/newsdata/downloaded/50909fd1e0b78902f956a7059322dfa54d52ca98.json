The decision is the result of a settlement agreement with a group of students who filed a class action lawsuit to reform allegedly discriminatory policies affecting student in mental health crises.\n\nThis development is timely as it directly addresses concerns over global suicide trends.\n\nSuicide rates continue to increase across all age groups in America, but the rising youth suicide epidemic, which has progressively increased since the 1950s, is particularly concerning among those who study it.\n\nSuicide is the 10th-leading cause of death across the U.S. population, but is second-most among college-aged students.\n\n\"We are facing a national mental health crisis, and college campuses are reflecting what\u2019s going on in society at large,\" Dr. Victor Schwartz, chief medical officer of the Jed Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to prevent suicides among young people, said in an interview with ABC News.\n\n(MORE: Data from medical offices, motels and animal shelters can help reduce suicides)\n\nDr. Doreen Marshall, vice president of programs at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, agreed: \"We hear from college and university counseling centers, they are seeing more students coming in reporting that they have some current or past suicidal ideation, which is a signal that this is a time that students are really struggling.\"\n\nAccording to the CDC, suicide rates across all ages increased in nearly every state between 1999 and 2016, and suicide rates went up more than 30% in half of states since 1999.\n\nIndependent of college, statistics reveal a spike in suicidality between the ages of 15 and 25. Until the age of 25, rational thinking and the ability to regulate emotions and impulses are still developing. The biological risk factors coupled with the inevitable challenges of acclimating to a new environment make college students more vulnerable to experiencing anxiety and mental health issues regardless of their mental health history.\n\n\"It\u2019s often their first time living independently and living away from their family, and a change in terms of access to their usual support networks from family and parents,\" said Marshall.\n\nDr. Stephanie Samar, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute, added that college students' lifestyle choices can aggravate depressive symptoms and stress.\n\n\"Many college students aren\u2019t taking care of their bodies. Many are experimenting with substances and not eating very well, or sleeping very well, in a way that would support them to meet all these new challenges,\" Samar said.\n\nCollege students today also face challenges that are particular to their generation, such as greater financial stress and an increasingly digital world that replaces face-to-face connection and may contribute to sensations of loneliness and isolation.\n\nSepp Panzer, a junior at Columbia University has experienced these anxieties first hand -- having struggled with depression throughout his childhood and attempting suicide in high school.\n\n\"My primary support was gone, and the pressure to succeed was such a strain and drove me back to depression,\" Panzer told ABC News, of going to college.\n\nPanzer recalled not wanting to get out of bed and said his suicidal thoughts resurfaced during his second year at Columbia.\n\n\"I felt suicidal and alone,\" he said. \"Going through the day depressed you always think everything in your life is your fault, you automatically resort to the fact that I\u2019m not good enough or I don\u2019t have what it takes.\"\n\nWorking to change his mindset and connect with those on campus, Panzer thinks that colleges need to promote quicker access to counseling services.\n\n\"In this state of crisis, students can\u2019t wait three weeks for an appointment. Changing that time frame will stop people from going over the edge,\" said Panzer.\n\n(MORE: Air Force to pause operations to address suicide)\n\nCollege counseling services face a particular challenge in developing protocols that can effectively triage and recognize students at higher risk.", "description": "Stanford University has agreed to change its involuntary leave of absence policy, mental health staffing and training to better accommodate students facing mental illness crises, including those who have been hospitalized following a suicide attempt.
