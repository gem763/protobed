Over the weekend, the probe was attempting to dig itself into the Martian soil when it popped out of the ground unexpectedly. Now, NASA engineers are trying to troubleshoot to see if they can get this instrument to burrow underneath Mars\u2019 surface as intended.\n\nThe probe belongs to NASA\u2019s InSight lander, a robot the size of a small car that landed on Mars in November of 2018. InSight\u2019s goal is to figure out what Mars\u2019 insides are made of, and the lander has two primary tools that it uses to \u201cpeer inside\u201d the planet. Its main instrument is a seismometer, tuned to listen for marsquakes or vibrations in the crust of Mars. These quakes act a bit like ultrasounds; the waves pass through the core of the planet, carrying details about what kinds of materials are trapped inside. So far, InSight\u2019s seismometer has detected about 100 vibration events, 21 of which are suspected to be quakes.\n\nInSight\u2019s second main instrument is the heat probe \u2014 nicknamed the mole. It\u2019s supposed to hammer down into the ground just next to InSight and take Mars\u2019 temperature. If it works as planned, it could give scientists more information about how much heat is leaving the planet\u2019s interior. But the mole hasn\u2019t had as much luck as the seismometer. In fact, it pretty much started having problems as soon as InSight got to the Red Planet. Since it started digging at the end of February, it hasn\u2019t been able to travel more than 14 inches (35 centimeters), even though it\u2019s designed to dig up to 16 feet (5 meters).\n\nThe InSight team thinks that the soil surrounding the mole may be to blame. While it digs, the mole needs the soil to fall around the probe uniformly, providing friction that allows the instrument to hammer farther underground. Otherwise, it\u2019d just bob up and down in one place, according to NASA. But testing has indicated that the soil in this particular spot is unlike soil encountered by previous landers on Mars. It\u2019s clumping around the probe and not providing any friction. That may explain the slow movement.\n\nMars continues to surprise us. While digging this weekend the mole backed about halfway out of the ground. Preliminary assessment points to unexpected soil properties as the main reason.

The idea was to pin the mole up against the side of the hole it created, providing the necessary friction it seems to be lacking. It seemed to be working for the last few weeks, but then this weekend, images from the InSight lander showed that the probe had partially backed out of its hole. Once again, NASA is blaming \u201cunusual soil conditions.\u201d\n\nNow the InSight team is trying to figure out what to do next. If it\u2019s safe, they may try to move the lander\u2019s robotic arm away from the mole to better figure out what\u2019s going on with the probe. If the worst-case scenario does become reality and the probe cannot dig underground, it\u2019s not the end of the world for the InSight mission. The lander\u2019s main goal is to learn more about the core of Mars by listening for marsquakes, which it\u2019s successfully doing. While getting a good temperature reading of the Martian interior would help characterize the planet\u2019s innards, it\u2019s not essential to the overall mission.", "description": "NASA\u2019s latest Mars lander is having problems with one of its main instruments \u2014 a self-hammering probe that just can\u2019t seem to hammer itself into the interplanetary dirt.
