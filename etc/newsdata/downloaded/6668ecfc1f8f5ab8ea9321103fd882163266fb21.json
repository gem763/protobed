Audra McDonald, who could provide the foundation of a house with all of her Tony Awards, will play Franklin\u2019s mother, Barbara. Marlon Wayans will play the legend\u2019s first husband, Ted White. Forest Whitaker will play Franklin\u2019s father and manager, the Reverend CL Franklin. Mary J. Blige will play fellow legend Dinah Washington. Tituss Burgess joins as \u201cKing of Gospel\u201d Reverend Dr. James Cleveland. Broadway performer Skye Dakota Turner will fill the key role of young Aretha. Hailey Kilgore, also a Tony nominee, will play the singer\u2019s sister, Carolyn, with yet another Tony nominee, Saycon Sengbloh, as the older sister, Erma. Tate Donovan and Marc Maron will play producers John Hammond and Jerry Wexler, respectively. So, that\u2019s all very impressive. Liesl Tommy is directing the film in which McDonald and Hudson will be daring Academy voters not to give them Oscars.", "description": "Audra McDonald, Titus Burgess, Marc Maron, Forest Whitaker, Marlon Wayans, and more join Jennifer Hudson in the Aretha Franklin biopic Respect.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/18-audra-mcdonald.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
