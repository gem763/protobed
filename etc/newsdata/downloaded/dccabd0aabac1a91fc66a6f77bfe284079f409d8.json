Or the seemingly watertight relationship between the administrations of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nBut the story of Trump, his closest advisers in the Middle East, and what is arguably the most dramatic change in direction of US policy towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in decades, is inextricably intertwined with Beit El, one of Israel\u2019s most radical settlements.\n\nIn the town, which overlooks the Palestinian administrative capital of Ramallah and is home to some 7,000 Israelis, David Friedman, Trump\u2019s chosen US ambassador to Israel, once headed an American fundraising organisation that has pumped millions of dollars into the settlement.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nJohn Bolton, Trump\u2019s recently dismissed national security adviser, has given a key-note speech at a fundraising event for it.\n\nThe parents of Jared Kushner, the US president\u2019s son-in-law, who is due to deliver his peace plan for the region in the coming months, have also donated many thousands to institutions that support the settlement.\n\nThe president himself, it was revealed in 2016, donated $10,000 Beit El in 2003, in honour of Friedman, his then bankruptcy lawyer.\n\nAnd it is the unique relationship Trump\u2019s cadres have with this settlement that is a keyhole to the overhaul in the US administration\u2019s attitudes towards Israel\u2019s policies in the Palestinian territories as a whole.\n\nSupporters and critics of Netanyahu alike, along with people in Washington, agree this change has emboldened the Israeli prime minister and allowed him to take, in some cases, unprecedented expansionist steps in the Palestinian territories.\n\nDays before the Israeli general election on Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu made an explosive announcement that he would annex the Jordan Valley and north Dead Sea area in the occupied West Bank immediately after being re-elected.\n\nWhile not the first time he has mentioned annexation, he set a time frame, provided a detailed map of what would be carved up and hinted that Mr Trump would support the move, despite it being illegal under international law and sure to fan the flames of conflict in the region.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Another Israeli rights group, B\u2019Tselem, meanwhile said that this year had seen the highest number of demolitions of Palestinian homes in Jerusalem for 15 years.\n\nCertainly, in the leafy streets of Beit El, where many buildings are emblazoned with plaques dedicated to Friedman, leading members of the settlement\u2019s community told The Independent they felt settlers were enjoying \u201cunprecedented\u201d support from a US administration.\n\n\u201cIt is clear David Friedman, Jared Kushner and [former Middle East envoy] Jason Greenblatt have a different ideological background to Barack Obama, which is refreshing to us,\u201d says Chaim Silberstein, who was born in South Africa and is now a member of the local council.\n\nHe cites moves by Trump including declaring the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, recognising Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in the 1960s, as well as closing the office of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation in Washington and slashing aid to the Palestinian territories.\n\n\u201cAll are unprecedented and important actions that show sincere fairness in my opinion and love for our country,\u201d he adds.\n\nFormer ambassadors to Israel, meanwhile, speak of how this shift has profoundly impacted the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Trump\u2019s Middle East team is due to deliver a peace plan, spearheaded by his son-in-law, after the Israeli elections.\n\n\u201cThis administration\u2019s policy is now to support everything Israel wants,\u201d says David C Kurtzer, who served as an ambassador under Bill Clinton. He said that was the \u201cfundamental change\u201d in bilateral relations between the two countries.\n\n\u201cThe real difference is where the US has effectively taken itself out of the game as a third-party mediator\u201d in the conflict, he adds.\n\nJames B Cunningham, who was US ambassador to Israel between 2008 and 2011, mostly agrees.\n\n\u201cIsraelis will dictate the terms of what peace looks like,\" he tells The Independent from Washington.\n\nMeanwhile he adds that the state of relations between the US and the Palestinians is \u201cthe worst in the modern age\u201d.\n\nBack in Beit El, the name of Trump\u2019s chosen ambassador is well known and loved, as are the Kushners.\n\nFriedman\u2019s name and that of his late father are enshrined on panels across a fitness centre, a centre for computer science and a girls\u2019 school building, which according to Israeli anti-settlement watchdogs is built on private Palestinian land without permission from its Palestinian landowners.\n\nThe residents gush with excitement when the conversation turns to the former attorney turned diplomat.\n\n\u201cDavid Friedman came to visit with his family before he was ambassador. They were very good, beautiful people, they care about others,\u201d says Nina Manne, who owns Beit El\u2019s sole vineyard, which produces 20,000 bottles of kosher wine a year that almost exclusively is sold to the US.\n\nShe says the reason that Friedman and other members of the Jewish community across the world are so drawn to Beit El is because of the religious significance of the place.\n\nIt is the alleged site where Biblical patriarch Jacob had a dream in which God promised him the land around him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same reason I came to live here 25 years ago,\u201d she adds.\n\nSilberstein says that part of its popularity has also been driven by the savvy fundraising of Yaakov Katz, the powerful founder of the settlement who in 2016 revealed to local media that Trump and the Kushners were among the star-studded donors to the settlement\u2019s educational programmes. Katz, a former member of parliament, also said he and Friedman go back decades and are \u201clike brothers\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is a combination of its authentic place in history and the unbelievable competence and success of Yaakov Katz that put Beit El on the world map,\u201d Silberstein adds.\n\n\u201cSuccessful lawyers like David Friedman like to back a winning horse.\u201d\n\nThe settlement was founded in 1977 on Palestinian land originally seized to build an Israeli military outpost.\n\nIt has gained major prominence over the years largely due to its yeshiva or religious school, which is run by Rabbi Zalman Melamed, who famously in 2005 urged Israeli soldiers to reject orders to evacuate Israeli settlements in Gaza.\n\nThe American fundraising organisation Friedman once headed supports institutions inside the settlement including the yeshiva, various secondary school educational programmes and an online news site Arutz Sheva, that Friedman has written for.\n\nOne of the yeshiva\u2019s programmes in the past trained Jewish students on American campuses in advocating against a two-state solution, which has been the accepted peace policy for US administrations for decades.\n\nFriedman himself funded the construction of a building which according to Israeli settlement researchers is not only illegal under international law but Israel\u2019s own legislation as it is built on private Palestinian land.\n\nDror Etkes, an Israeli expert on settlement construction, told The Independent that there is even a 2002 Israeli demolition order out against the building, known as the \u201cFriedman Faculty House\u201d.\n\nThe girls\u2019 school block, which has not been demolished, still has a placard on it commemorating Friedman\u2019s donation and his family.\n\nEtkes calls Beit El \u201cone of the most aggressive and problematic settlements in terms of position\u201d because it is built right next to Ramallah and Bireh, key administrative towns for the Palestinians.\n\n\u201cIt is the symbol of the Israeli attempt to dissect the West Bank with settlements\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cAnd so, it is an example of how the Trump administration is aligned with the most politically extreme groups in Israeli politics today,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe Trump administration is aligned with the most politically extreme groups in Israeli politics today Dror Etkes, Israeli researcher on settlements\n\nBeyond Beit El, it is clear that Trump\u2019s advisers, including Friedman and Kushner, have successfully altered the US\u2019s chosen position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and so the reality on the ground.\n\nBack in Washington, former ambassador Cunningham says it has changed so much there is \u201cno hope\u201d for the long-awaited plan due to drop after the Israeli elections on Tuesday.\n\nHe cites concerns such as the fact that \u201csettlement expansion is no longer an issue\u201d and that terms like a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d to the crisis have been all but dropped.\n\nKurtzer also speaks about the worrying erosion of terms.\n\n\u201cFriedman has been instrumental in the change of language. [The Trump administration] don\u2019t use the word \u2018occupation\u2019, they don\u2019t use the word \u2018two-state solution\u2019. Friedman has said he doesn\u2019t call them settlements, they are communities and neighbourhoods.\"\n\nKurtzer also said another indicator was the recent appointment of a 30-year-old law graduate with no experience in the region or foreign policy as the US\u2019s Middle East envoy to manage the upcoming peace plan.\n\nAvi Berkowitz, who was described in 2017 by Hope Hicks, the White House\u2019s then head of communications, as Kushner\u2019s coffee boy, is replacing Jason Greenblatt, who has resigned.\n\n\u201cI have compared this process to a magic show where the illusionist tells you, \u2018Keep your eye on your left hand while the action is actually going on with your right,\u2019\u201d Kurtzer concludes about the Trump administration\u2019s outlook.\n\n\u201cThey are telling us to keep our eyes on the plan, but the action is on the ground like moving the embassy to Jerusalem, cutting off communications with the Palestinians\u2026 that is the goal. The whole process is a farce.\u201d", "description": "At first glance, it is hard to see how a sleepy neighbourhood draped across the crest of a hill deep in the occupied West Bank could offer any insight into US policy on Israel.
