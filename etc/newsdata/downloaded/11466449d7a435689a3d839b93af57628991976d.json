Giacomo Costa, a communications official for the Amazon synod, said Wednesday a wooden figure of a nude pregnant woman, which has been present at events related to the synod, is not the Virgin Mary, but is instead a female figure representing life.\n\n\u201cIt is not the Virgin Mary, who said it is the Virgin Mary?\u201d Costa said Oct. 16 at a press conference for the Amazon synod, a meeting taking place in the Vatican Oct. 6-27 on the ministry of the Church in the region.\n\nCosta referred to a controversial image of a female figure which was part of a tree-planting ceremony in the Vatican Oct. 4. The same figure has been present in the vicinity of the Vatican at various events happening during the synod, under the \u201cCasa Comun\u201d initiative.\n\nThe wooden figure of a pregnant woman has been described as both a Marian image and as a traditional indigenous religious symbol of the goddess Pachamama, or Mother Earth.\n\nWhen told \u201cmany people have said\u201d the woman is a figure of the Virgin Mary, Costa added \u201c\u2018many have said,\u2019 okay, as you like, but I have never heard that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to know. It is an indigenous woman who represents life,\u201d he stated, adding that his information commission will look for more information about it, but \u201cit is a feminine figure\u201d and is \u201cneither pagan nor sacred.\u201d\n\nPaolo Ruffini, prefect of the Vatican communications dicastery, said Wednesday he sees the figure as \u201crepresenting life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFundamentally, it represents life. And enough. I believe to try and see pagan symbols or to see... evil, it is not,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit represents life through a woman.\u201d He equated the image to that of a tree, saying \u201ca tree is a sacred symbol.\u201d\n\nRuffini said that interpretation is his personal opinion, and he was not speaking as the head of Vatican communications or synod communications.\n\nHe added that \u201cWe know that some things in history have many interpretations\u201d and he would look for more information about the image and inform journalists about what he finds out.\n\nCristiane Murray, vice director of the Holy See press office, added that more information about the wooden figure should be sought from REPAM or the organizers of the events where the image has been present.\n\nMauricio Lopez, REPAM's executive secretary, told CNA after the press conference that he could not comment on the press conference, directing CNA to Costa's remarks, as the \"official spokesperson\" of the Synod.\n\nREPAM (the Pan-Amazonian Ecclesial Network), a group backed by the bishops\u2019 conferences in Latin America, describes itself as an advocacy organization for the rights and dignity of indigenous people in the Amazon. The network is involved in operations for the synod assembly and is one of 14 groups on the organizing committee of the Casa Comun initiative, which is promoting more than 115 events hosted by a loose network of groups, connected in varying degrees to the Catholic Church.", "description": "", "authors": ["Vatican City", "Oct", "Am"], "top_image": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Image_of_figures.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
