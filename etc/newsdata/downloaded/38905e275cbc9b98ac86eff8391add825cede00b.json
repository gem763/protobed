I keep waking up and wishing it was just a bad dream. It is better for me to think he is having an adventure and is enjoying it. It is heart-wrenching and I feel helpless.'\n\nMr Kettlewell was granted 50/50 access of his son in September 2018 after he and his mother split in 2013. He then obtained a court order to stop Myles from leaving the country.\n\nHe said: 'To prevent parental child abduction, and Myles leaving the UK without my permission, specific issue orders made by the court were put in place. One of which entitled me to hold both Myles' passport, as I posed no risk of abducting my own son.'\n\nCourts had denied Myles's mother permission to take him to Russia because he has Autism and does not speak the language\n\nA GoFundMe page has now been set up to help Mr Kettlewell raise the legal fees to fight for his son in Russia\n\nMyles' mother was denied another request to move to Russia with him in June, but granted permission to take him on holiday in July.\n\nMr Kettlewell added: 'Despite raising my natural concern regarding his safety, I was given little choice by the court but to agree to this. She therefore took Myles on holiday, and returned, albeit a day later than what had been agreed.\n\n'Since returning to the U.K. she retained Myles' passport and refused to hand it back to me. Once more, I had no choice but to apply to the court for an enforcement order to guarantee the safe return of his passport to me.\n\n'A date was then scheduled with the court on October 3 for this to be settled. Little did I know that this date would not be met and my son's passport would not be the only thing snatched from my life.'\n\nIn a bid to take his son's passport back, Mr Kettlewell went to his ex's home - but found someone else living there after she 'moved out under the cover of midnight' days earlier.\n\nHe added: 'I thought she must have moved house so I phoned the school to get their help delivering the papers and they rang back to say his mother had taken him out.\n\n'I didn't know what to do. I put my shoes on and ran out the door but I didn't know where I was going.\n\n'I knew he had been taken from school and she would be attempting to go to the airport but I thought there was a block on his passport so I was quite confident and hoping I would get a phone call from the police to say she had been stopped and was in custody, but that was when they told me he was on a flight the night before.\n\n'The toughest thing is that we almost stopped her.'\n\nMr Kettlewell said his 'worst fears became reality' when his son Myles was taken out of school by his mother who then fled to her native Russia with him\n\nIn a bid to take his son's passport back, Mr Kettlewell went to his ex's home - but found someone else living there after she 'moved out under the cover of midnight' days earlier. When he then went to his school, Myles was gone\n\nMr Kettlewell added: 'Myles was diagnosed in 2017 with autism and is lucky to be in a mainstream school that supports his needs brilliantly.\n\n'For Myles, stability is quite simply all about being at home where he is able to enjoy the simplest of pleasures.\n\n'Comfort for Myles is certainly not about flying to an unfamiliar country and being dumped in a land of strangers where he is unable to speak the language.\n\n'On the morning of September 30, I did not know that this would be the last time I would be dropping my son at school, or that this kiss goodbye would be our last. I did not know that I would not be collecting him from school because he would not be there.\n\n'It was only when I contacted the school to arrange a meeting at the end of the day between myself, Myles' mother and a member of staff that the real nightmare began.\n\n'My beautiful son was boarding his plane bound for Russia at 10.45pm and was being abducted.\n\n'My son is a not a possession; he is a human being with rights and feelings.. I miss him. I fear for him. And I desperately want him back home where he belongs and where he can be himself.'\n\nA spokesperson for Suffolk Police confirmed they were investigating a reported abduction.\n\nA GoFundMe page has now been set up to help Mr Kettlewell raise the legal fees to fight for his son in Russia.\n\nWaveney MP Peter Aldous confirmed he is liaising with the Foreign Office and has written to foreign secretary Dominic Raab to seek assistance in bringing Myles back to the country.", "description": "Ian Kettlewell, from Lowestoft in Suffolk, said his\u00a0'worst fears became reality' when his son Myles was taken out of school by his mother who then fled to her native Russia with him.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/10/19530936-0-image-a-20_1570698058678.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
