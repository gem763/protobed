People always think there\u2019s something wrong with me because I don\u2019t have that many girlfriends but I do love girls \u2014 I love their sensitivity and all the stuff like that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why I identify more as a gay man because I like guys but I also identify as a guy.\u2019\n\nTrisha will still use female pronouns\n\nHowever, it got confusing later on in the video when Trisha said that while she one thousand percent \u2018thinks\u2019 she is transgender,\n\nHowever, viewers were confused when Trisha later said that while she one thousand percent \u2018thinks\u2019 she is transgender, she also \u2018a thousand percent\u2019 identifies with her \u2018natural born gender\u2019.\n\nTrisha explained: \u2018In my head I feel like I\u2019m a female transgender to male but also like a drag queen\u2026 I don\u2019t like to be the center of attention, except for when I want to be the center of attention.\n\n\u2018Think of like a drag queen: they do their full glam and everything but in their day to day they\u2019re not, they\u2019re very low-key, whatever.\u2019\n\nTrisha concluded the video: \u2018I think that\u2019s where I\u2019m at and I feel really free and liberated.\u2019\n\nSharing their frustration with Trisha\u2019s comments, one Twitter user said: \u2018Trisha it\u2019s not about how you dress it\u2019s literally that you\u2019re 100% okay with your birth gender and you only feel like a guy bc you have guy friends and wanna date gay guys and have short hair you cannot just choose to be trans like that.\u2019\n\nA member of the LGBTQ community said: \u2018I feel worried about how my entire identity is seen because of this video. i feel like i\u2019m being made fun of, i feel im being treated as a joke.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne other weighed in: \u2018You literally said you CHOSE to identify as a boy. Being trans is *NOT* a choice. You cannot CHOOSE it. This stupid s**t is the whole reason trans and gnc people aren\u2019t taken seriously and we\u2019re struggling to make progress. The only ignorant one here is you.\u2019\n\nDefending herself against the backlash, Trisha tweeted: \u2018It\u2019s not meant to be funny. Because I don\u2019t look like a traditional male on the outside , I\u2019m a joke ? Men can wear dresses , heels and makeup u know. Close minded and ignorant.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
