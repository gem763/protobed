But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...\n\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) is a phenomenon.\n\nGoing public at a share price of just $25, the stock got close to becoming a 10-bagger by late July, topping out just short of $235. It's been all downhill since, however. With investors finally spooked at the sky-high valuation, Beyond Meat has shed a third of its value over just the past six weeks -- and the selling may not be over yet.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHamburger More\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nTime to sell Beyond Meat?\n\nThis morning, investment bank D.A. Davidson initiated coverage of Beyond Meat with an underperform rating (i.e., sell) and a $130 price target.\n\nNow, before I say anything more about this sell rating, it's important to point out: D.A. Davidson does not hate Beyond Meat stock. Far from it. In fact, the analyst praises the company, saying it \"has achieved a significant breakthrough which legitimizes a nascent segment (plant based meat)\" and suggests plant-based meat could eventually evolve into a large slice of the $1.4 trillion global meat market.\n\nDavidson likes the \"quality\" of Beyond Meat's portfolio, \"its ability to execute,\" and the business itself. About the only thing the analyst doesn't like, in fact, is the valuation -- because according to Davidson, it's based on a flawed assumption about how big this market can grow.\n\nMeat is sort of like milk\n\nIf you recall the early days of Beyond Meat (it shouldn't be hard -- the company only went public in May), the concept of \"total addressable market\" was key to analysts setting valuations on the stock.\n\nIn particular, analysts analogized the market for plant-based meat to that for plant-based milk and other \"alternative dairy\" products -- soy milk, almond milk, and the like. Currently, such not-really-milk products are worth about $2 billion a year in sales, or 13% of the overall dairy market.\n\nAssuming plant-based meat sales likewise grow to capture a similar proportion of the $1.4 trillion market for meat, therefore, then even if Beyond Meat doesn't capture the whole market (Davidson says a 31% market share isn't out of the question), its sales could one day measure in the tens of billions of dollars. UBS, for example, has predicted that by 2030, we could see as much as $85 billion in annual sales of plant-based meat.\n\nThat's as opposed to the $165 million in sales Beyond Meat has racked up over the last 12 months.\n\nBut meat isn't exactly like milk\n\nBut here's the thing: Consumers who buy plant-based meat may overlap with consumers who buy plant-based milk -- but the populations aren't identical. Some people buy plant-based milk because they want to, either for health reasons or out of environmental concerns. But as Davidson points out, a lot of people buy plant-based milk because they have to -- they're lactose intolerant, and simply can't digest regular milk.\n\nIn fact, Davidson asserts that \"roughly half\" of plant-based-milk buyers do so because they're lactose intolerant and have to buy, rather than because they're vegetarian and want to buy. And that means that the market for plant-based meat, when expressed as a percentage of total meat consumers, could be only half as big as the market for plant-based dairy.", "description": "One analyst finds a fatal flaw in the buy thesis.", "authors": ["Rich Smith", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/08Ia_zSwCBa_K383lXxBAg--~B/aD00NjY7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/81c1cc11fc014db18265206384bce716", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
