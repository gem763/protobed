As we learned during tonight\u2019s Dancing With the Stars, the NFL Hall of Famer was forced to quit because of a nagging foot injury. That was relatively good news for his fellow celebrities because it meant no elimination during week 3 (and no available Lewis Jr. to take over, either!). More on Lewis\u2019 sad story later.\n\nLet\u2019s get to the glitter, fringe, and Movie Night! (Cue: \u201cFame.\u201d) Oh and hi, Demi Lovato, Jonathan Scott, and Zooey Deschanel! Thanks for coming to the ballroom.\n\nRay Lewis and Cheryl Burke: Lewis tore a tendon during a 2010 football game, and because of \u201call this dancing, all of this on my toes, I\u2019m reliving a problem that I never thought I had to relive again,\u201d he said. In the rehearsal package, Lewis choked up when talking about the pain he felt at every practice and how his doctor implored him not to dance again. So long, Ray! But the show went on: Season 24 winner Rashad Jennings joined Burke in a performance of the cha-cha to \u201cTwist and Shout,\u201d from Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off.\n\nLamar Odom and Peta Murgatroyd: In his liveliest performance this season, the baller cha-cha\u2019ed to \u201cOld Time Rock and Roll,\u201d from Risky Business. It was going relatively well until Odom\u2019s roll tripped over his rock later in the number, prompting the judges to pan him yet again. \u201cI like to see you dance because you are so much fun, and I was optimistic about it because you were doing great,\u201d judge Len Goodman said. \u201cBut the wheels fell off.\u201d \u201cYou channeled the love you felt from the audience,\u201d said judge Carrie Ann Inaba. Score: 12 out of 30\n\nSean Spicer and Lindsay Arnold: The former White House press secretary got to perform the last dance the night \u2014 a disco cha-cha \u2014 to \u201cNight Fever.\u201d In a white suit. With lots of backup dancers. And arm extensions. \u201cI don\u2019t know about Saturday Night Fever; it\u2019s more about Monday Night Lukewarm,\u201d said Goodman. \u201cYou are so pigeon-toed.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d Bruno Tonioli added. \u201cYou turned Saturday Night Fever into a disaster blockbuster!\u201d At least Inaba threw him a bone. \u201cYou are living your best life\u2026 People seem to love you.\u201d Score: 15 out of 30\n\nKaramo Brown and Jenna Johnson: The Queer Eye star said \u201cI\u2019m Still Standing\u201d is his life story, so he used the Elton John tune to dance the jive with backup dancers and a video of support from Rocketman\u2019s Taron Egerton. Hey, the audience loved it! \u201cYou make us feel joy, but tonight you had a lot of mistakes,\u201d said Inaba. \u201cHopefully you don\u2019t go home because I want to see more of you.\u201d \u201cYou came straight onto the floor and you started dancing jive,\u201d added Goodman. \u201cThat was terrific.\u201d Score: 16 out of 30\n\nLauren Alaina and Gleb Savchenko: Finding inspiration from Pretty Woman, the country singer wore a slinky costume \u2014 complete with long black boots \u2014 that Julie Roberts made famous in the movie and danced the tango to the Roy Orbison song of the same name. She went first for the night \u2014 and for a good reason, it seems. \u201cThis was full of attack, drive, and purpose,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cA little stop and start here and there but the tango you did was excellent.\u201d Added Tonioli, \u201cYou\u2019re racy little thing. That was a racy tango, full throttle! Go for it, girl, you have an edge. Use it.\u201d Score: 20 out of 30\n\nKel Mitchell and Witney Carson: The \u201cbig Leonardo fan\u201d performed a splendid rumba to \u201cMy Heart Will Go On,\u201d from Titanic. He thought he nailed it, too. \u201cReally solid dancing,\u201d said Inaba. \u201cYou made every detail so specific, though you were a little tight. You are making your energy super-tight. Spread it out.\u201d \u201cIt was always a good, solid performance,\u201d said Goodman. Score: 20 out of 30\n\nHannah Brown and Alan Bersten: Still high off the news that Taylor Swift shared her performance from last week on Instagram, the Bachelorette star danced the rumba to the Wilson Phillips song \u201cHold On,\u201d which you may remember from Bridesmaids. But it needed more hips! \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful, wonderful lyrical dancer,\u201d said Tonioli. \u201cYou have to use the floor more and engage the lower half, push your feet through the floor.\u201d \u201cYour upper half is exquisite, but there was no hip action,\u201d added Inaba. Score: 21 out of 30\n\nJames Van Der Beek and Emma Slater: The actor dedicated his rumba \u2014 performed to \u201cShallow,\u201d from A Star Is Born \u2014 to his lucky wife, Kimberly. \u201cThe audience is obviously going gaga over James!\u201d said Tonioli. \u201cYou made your partner look fantastic. A real gentleman!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re juiced every little ounce of emotion,\u201d said Inaba. \u201cIt was stunning.\u201d Score: 23 out of 30", "description": "Dancing With the Stars recap: Season 28, Episode 3: Movie Night", "authors": ["Lynette Rice"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/D2RiD.jFfNRp_P7MwWN8IA--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/a2ed987fa78dd0609e4e24c29548b2c2", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
