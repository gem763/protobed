But the party claims that it will shrink the deficit by $10 billion the following year, and be running a $401 million surplus by 2023-24.\n\nThe document also provides budget details for 16 revenue changes, ranging from capital gains adjustments to a wealth tax, and 86 spending promises including universal pharmacare, free post-secondary tuition and the elimination of student debt, and the development of a national food waste strategy.\n\nHowever, a number of other major party promises \u2014 like phasing out oilsands production, increasing the federal carbon levy by $10 a year after 2022, and a guaranteed \"livable income\" for older and out-of-work Canadians \u2014 were not included in the estimates.\n\nTo date, the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) has released its own costing for 23 of the Green Party's platform promises \u2014 13 of the revenue changes and 10 of the spending proposals.\n\nMore Green promises have been vetted\n\nIn that regard, the Greens are way out in front. As of Thursday afternoon, the PBO has vetted 13 Conservatives promises, and four from the New Democratic Party. No Liberal Party pledges have been independently costed. Ditto for the Bloc Qu\u00e9be\u00e7ois, and the People's Party of Canada.\n\nWhat the PBO determined however, might make the Greens wish they never bothered. Ten of the party's price tags are rated as having \"moderate uncertainty,\" and the remaining 13 are rated as having \"high uncertainty.\"\n\nTake the party's pledge to create a new, 0.5 per cent tax on all financial transactions in Canada, for example. The Greens claim that it will raise $15.7 billion in new revenue in 2021-22 and $18.1 billion a year by 2024-25 \u2014 the single biggest tax increase they are counting on to finance their ambitious plans.\n\nBut according to the PBO, the response of the financial markets to such a tax is so unclear that the revenue estimates \"could be off by factors of 2 or 3 in either direction (higher or lower).\"\n\nBig windfall? Huge hole? Dead on? Who knows?\n\nOutside assessment gives failing grade\n\nOther outside assessments of the Green platform pricing are even harsher.\n\nThe Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy (IFSD) at the University of Ottawa has issued a \"Fiscal Credibility Assessment\" and gives the Green Party a failing grade when it comes to realistic economic assumption, responsible fiscal management, and transparency.\n\nKevin Page, the former parliamentary budget officer who heads the institute, says the Green Party costing is riddled with errors \u2014 for example the numbers in the detailed tables don't match the overview totals. And it all appears to be based on outdated, 2018 fiscal projections.\n\n\"To us, it looked like it was put together in a very hurried fashion,\" says Page. \"Somebody made a mistake.\"\n\nPage gives the party credit for asking the PBO to cost out many of its \"toughest measures.\" But he says that Elizabeth May's proposals on the move to a zero-carbon economy and rebalancing the tax system are so transformative that much more detail is required before they can be fairly assessed.\n\nThe Green Party has acknowledged the errors and omissions and says it is working to correct them.\n\nGreens say revisions coming\n\n\"We are currently undertaking a review and will present a revised version in due course,\" Rosie Emery, a party spokesperson, said in an emailed statement.\n\nBut the public shouldn't expect any more independent analysis. Emery says that the PBO has now released all of the Greens' requested costing estimates.\n\n(It also seems likely that the Greens have used up their allotted share of the resources and money that the Parliamentary Budget Officer dedicated to studying election promises. And with a little more than three weeks to go before ballots are cast, the PBO's \"absolute deadline\" for new requests \u2014 15 business days before the election \u2014 is looming.)\n\nGenevi\u00e8ve Tellier, a University of Ottawa political scientist who studies budgetary policies and public finances, says the PBO costing \u2014 a new wrinkle for a federal election campaign \u2014 is working better than she expected; providing a level of detail about party promises and their underlying assumptions that voters have never had before.\n\nSmall parties at a disadvantage\n\nBut the new system may not be working in the Greens' favour.\n\n\"A smaller party may be disadvantaged,\" says Tellier, noting their relative lack of in-house expertise and money. \"The bigger parties are better able to manipulate their numbers, or try to present them to their own advantage.\"\n\nIn other words, honesty may be the best \u2014 but not the most politically sophisticated \u2014 policy.\n\nThe Verdict: Partially true. The Greens have shared more information about their promises than any of the other federal parties, thus far. But errors in their math, and a number of big, unpriced pledges, make their claim of complete transparency a little cloudy.", "description": "The Greens have released more details and costed more promises than any other party.
