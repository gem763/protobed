The 16-year-old has been open about being diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, embracing it as her \u201csuperpower.\u201d\n\n[Greta Thunberg had one question at the U.N. climate summit: \u2018How dare you?\u2019]\n\nAmid the intense blowback over Knowles\u2019s remarks Monday night after a clip of the show went viral, Fox News apologized to Thunberg.\n\n\u201cThe comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful \u2014 we apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers,\u201d a spokesperson for the network told The Washington Post in a statement.\n\nFox News also said it has \u201cno plans\u201d to book Knowles.\n\nKnowles did not respond to a request for comment late Monday but defended himself on Twitter, writing: \u201cThere is nothing shameful about living with mental disorders. What is shameful is exploiting a child \u2014 particularly a child with mental disorders \u2014 to advance your political agenda.\u201d\n\nThunberg has called the condition a \u201cgift\u201d and credited it with sparking her activism.\n\n\u201cSome people mock me for my diagnosis. But Asperger is not a disease, it\u2019s a gift. People also say that since I have Asperger I couldn\u2019t possibly have put myself in this position. But that\u2019s exactly why I did this,\u201d she wrote on Facebook in February. \u201cBecause if I would have been \u2018normal\u2019 and social I would have organized myself in an organisation, or started an organisation by myself. But since I am not that good at socializing I did this instead. I was so frustrated that nothing was being done about the climate crisis and I felt like I had to do something, anything.\u201d\n\nThe network\u2019s apology comes as conservatives have ramped up their broadsides against Thunberg, who traveled to the United States earlier this month on a solar-powered sailboat and has since been chastising powerful politicians about their inaction on climate change. In a widely reviled tweet over the weekend, conservative commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza compared Thunberg to young people featured in Nazi propaganda, sharing a photo of the Swedish teen alongside an illustration of a Caucasian girl sporting braided hair and holding a Nazi flag. On Monday, Sebastian Gorka, the former Breitbart editor and White House aide, labeled Thunberg as an \u201cautist child.\u201d\n\nEven President Trump weighed in late Monday with a tweet that many took as sarcastic.\n\n\u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\u201d Trump tweeted shortly after 11:30 p.m., sharing a video of Thunberg delivering her fiery address at the U.N. climate summit. \u201cSo nice to see!\u201d\n\nShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nKnowles made his statements about Thunberg while appearing on the \u201cThe Story with Martha MacCallum,\u201d and his description of the teenager instantly sparked a rebuke from liberal radio host Christopher Hahn, who had also been invited on as a guest.\n\n\u201cHow dare you?\u201d Hahn could be heard interjecting.\n\nWhen Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner, who was filling in for MacCallum, gave Hahn the floor, he tore into Knowles.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a grown man and you\u2019re attacking a child,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cShame on you.\u201d\n\nThe pair then began talking over each other as Knowles insisted he wasn\u2019t going after Thunberg, but rather \u201cattacking the left for exploiting a mentally ill child.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, relax, skinny boy,\u201d Hahn barked, eliciting a noise of surprise from Faulkner and a chuckle from Knowles. \u201cHave some couth when you\u2019re on television. Maybe on your podcast you get away and say whatever you want because nobody\u2019s listening. You\u2019re on national television. Be a grown-up when you\u2019re talking about children.\u201d\n\nHahn later added: \u201cYou are despicable for talking about her like that. You should apologize on national television right now.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Knowles stuck to his talking point that Thunberg is \u201cmentally ill,\u201d pointing to a family memoir that recounted details from the teenager\u2019s childhood.\n\n\u201cShe has autism,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has obsessive compulsive disorder. She has selective mutism. She had depression. Her mother wrote about this in a book.\u201d\n\nIgnoring Hahn\u2019s barbs, Knowles told the radio host, \u201cYou can inveigh all you want, but unfortunately, you don\u2019t have many facts on your side.\u201d\n\nThe heated exchange, which lasted more than two minutes, quickly spread on social media Monday night. By early Tuesday, one video of the short segment had amassed more than 1.6 million views.\n\nCritics denounced Knowles\u2019s comments, which also drew swift backlash from autism advocacy organizations.\n\n\u201cTo intentionally demean any person, regardless of neuro-diversity, is both cruel and wrong,\u201d the Autism Society said in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cCertainly some might disagree with Ms. Thunberg on policy issues, but it is shameful to issue a derogatory statement to a youth advocate.\u201d\n\n[Analysis: Trump and his ilk clash with the global climate movement]\n\nJulia Bascom, executive director of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, told THR that it is \u201cabsolutely unconscionable to attack someone for their disability, especially when that person is a child.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory is full of autistic people and people with other cognitive disabilities who were and are compelling, credible activists and leaders,\u201d Bascom said. \u201cGreta is a part of that tradition, and our community is lucky to have her. Period.\u201d\n\nBut others supported Knowles, including fellow conservative pundit Ann Coulter.\n\n\u201cSPECTACULAR!!!!\u201d tweeted Coulter about Monday\u2019s segment.\n\nSomeone just called me to re-play @michaeljknowles tv segment over the phone for me. SPECTACULAR!!!! https://t.co/YIriOh8mPC \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) September 24, 2019\n\nDespite Fox News\u2019s apology, the segment featuring Knowles and Hahn wasn\u2019t the last time Monday night that Thunberg was mentioned on the network.\n\nHours later on her show, Fox News host Laura Ingraham played a clip of Thunberg speaking at the climate summit and compared the teen to characters in the 1984 horror film \u201cChildren of the Corn,\u201d based off a novel by Stephen King.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for Stephen King\u2019s sequel, \u2018Children of the Climate,\u2019\u201d Ingraham said.", "description": "The 16-year-old climate activist has been open about being diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, embracing it as her \u201csuperpower.\u201d", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team", "September At Am", "Allyson Chiu Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
