They will go back and forth on whether policies should be centrist or progressive and how much to talk about President Trump in an effort to balance appeals to primary voters now and a broader coalition later.\n\nBut the Ohio voters who are up for grabs aren\u2019t thinking about left or right. They\u2019re focused on solving the problems plaguing their families right now. Their lives are precarious, and most don\u2019t think anyone in politics has their back.\n\nAt Working America, the labor movement\u2019s field organizing arm, we have been reaching out to people who don\u2019t have a union on the job in Ohio since 2003. Last week , we completed 1,031 interviews of working-class voters in the state. We\u2019ve engaged these voters over the past four years through face-to-face conversations and online surveys so we can assess trends like what voters care about, why and what it means for 2020.\n\nAlmost one-third of these people are unsure about who they will vote for in 2020, including some voters who went for Donald Trump in 2016 but are now wavering.", "description": "Undecided voters in Ohio are focused on urgent bread-and-butter issues.", "authors": ["Karen Nussbaum"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/opinion/14nussbaumWeb/14nussbaumWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
