Black, gay, [the] '80s. We went straight to the front lines to fight for our lives,\u201d Porter began. \u201cThe 'T' in LGBTQ, for me, was unconsciously absent from my knowledge or understanding for real. This show and these ladies and these trans men on this show has taught me what true authenticity really looks like. And we get to teach the world what that looks like with our show. And it is the biggest gift and blessing that any artist could ever hope or dream for.\u201d\n\nPorter, who celebrated the big 5-0 just two days ago, opened up about the most difficult aspect of working on the trailblazing series and said the show\u2019s somber tone actually took a toll on him.\n\nBILLY PORTER DEFENDS OSCARS TUXEDO GOWN AFTER BACKLASH\n\n\u201cTwo difficult things that were hard for me. The subject matter \u2013 you know, the AIDS crisis part of it can be really dark. Sometimes that can be really dark. Sometimes that's hard to live inside of,\u201d said Porter, adding that Season 2 was easier to perform due in part to a more encouraging storyline.\n\n\u201cThe fun version of that is this past season. They wrote Pray Tell not being able to walk in heels. That was difficult to act,\u201d Porter explained with hysterical amusement. \u201cAnd then the sex scene \u2013 I had never had a love scene before and that was like, 'Ahhh! They're making me naked at 49!'\u201d\n\nAfter accepting his Emmy honor, the performer spoke to reporters backstage in the press room and praised \u201cQueer Eye\u201d star Jonathan Van Ness for revealing his HIV-positive status and shedding new light on the discussion to usher change.\n\nSEE ALL THE WINNERS OF THE 2019 EMMYS\n\n\u201cWe need to take the stigma away from it, influence people like Jonathan who allow for the stigma to be taken away,\u201d said Porter. \u201cIt's not HIV porn, you know. It's not all sadness, just like our show. You know, the point of our show is aspirational.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou're watching people in the depths of the worst of circumstances \u2013 the most dire of circumstances, choose life anyway. We all choose life anyway. That's what it's about. I'm happy for Jonathan and I'm happy for the world.\u201d", "description": "Billy Porter certainly had himself a night on Sunday while making Emmy history.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/billy-porter-emmys-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
