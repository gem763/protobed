Trump narrowly won these states in 2016 \u2014 and they will be crucial for his path to winning a second term.\n\n\u201cThe president does not believe California is in play, but there is surprisingly a decent pot of money in fundraising in the state,\u201d said one close White House adviser. \u201cThe same people who gave to his campaign have a list of problems they have with the state, and they\u2019re running up against a Democratic state legislature while looking for creative solutions.\u201d\n\nTrump is more than happy to listen to their concerns at roundtables and private dinners and lunches. Trump supporter and California attorney Harmeet Dhillon said the president\u2019s message to California-based donors this week behind closed doors included discussions of rising property crime, immigration and homelessness in San Francisco.\n\nThe four fundraisers Trump attended in Los Angeles, San Diego, Beverly Hills and the San Francisco area netted $15 million for Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee made up of the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, said one Republican official familiar with the events.\n\nCalifornia Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.

In 2016, between May and the November election, the Trump campaign and the RNC took in roughly $11.2 million in donations of at least $5,000 or more from California residents, according to data from the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThat included donations from Steven Mnuchin, who worked on the Trump campaign and later became Treasury Secretary, and Tom Barrack, Trump\u2019s longtime billionaire friend currently under investigation by federal prosecutors.\n\nIn late 2018 and 2019, Trump\u2019s support from California Republicans comes from real estate industry executives, players in California\u2019s huge agricultural sector \u2014 long a supporter of and geographic home to California Republicans \u2014 and technology executives who have broken with the industry\u2019s generally liberal bent.\n\nThis includes Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and an entrepreneur, as well as donors who are not household names, including: Geoffrey H. Palmer, a real estate developer; Barbara M. Grimm-Marshall, owner of Grimmway Farms; entrepreneur Jarrett Streebin; and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nTwo close advisers to the White House said the Trump campaign always raises the majority of its money from donors in California, New York, Texas, and Florida, given the wealth in the four states.\n\nTrump's attention to California-specific issues helps make donors feel heard, they added, especially since Trump has never been able to tap into establishment Republican money in any meaningful way in states like Connecticut, Massachusetts or New Jersey.\n\nThe Trump campaign also intends to continue to elevate the state as a cautionary example for what it considers an overly liberal government run amok, compared to the #MAGA worldview Trump has created. The campaign is casting California as socialism on steroids, with the state suddenly the president\u2019s favorite political foil.\n\nDemocrats control more than two-thirds of the California Legislature while Republicans have fallen to third in voter registration, trailing independents. Even longtime GOP bastions such as Orange County have turned blue, a major reason Republicans hold only seven of the state's 53 seats in Congress.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing sense that California is just out of control,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House and a longtime friend of Trump\u2019s who serves as an informal political adviser. \u201cThe president is ultimately going to run a campaign of contrasts. The party that cannot fix Baltimore also cannot fix San Francisco and cannot fix the homeless problem there. He is looking for opportunities to draw the contrast between the two Americas, and I think it is greatly to the left\u2019s disadvantage.\u201d\n\nTrump certainly played up that theme during his visit.\n\nOn Air Force One during the ride back to Washington D.C., he announced the Environmental Protection Agency would soon give San Francisco a notice of environmental violations related to its homelessness problem. The president said pollution was flowing into the ocean in California because of waste in storm sewers caused by objects like used needles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible situation \u2014 that\u2019s in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,\u201d he said on the plane. \u201cWe can\u2019t have our cities going to hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President is underlining the failure of liberal leadership in major cities, in California and elsewhere, to draw a contrast with the success of his own policies. And the success of his fundraising in California is evidence that there are millions of Golden State residents who enthusiastically support his re-election,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, director of communications for the president\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\n\u201cIt is also important for California Republicans to stay engaged, because there are a number of House seats we can regain with President Trump\u2019s help at the top of the ticket,\u201d Murtaugh added.\n\nAttorney Dhillon, who rode with Trump in his motorcade in California and had previously attended a White House social media summit enlisting conservative voices, rejected the notion that Trump was \u201cretaliating\u201d against California\u2019s Democratic leaders.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of interest here despite the one-party rule\u201d in what the president has to say, added Dhillon.\n\nThe president also always loves a good foil \u2014 from the New York Times to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to state political figures and business leaders in the nation\u2019s most populous and arguably bluest state.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of bogeyman who reside in California,\u201d joked one source close to the campaign about the president\u2019s most recent visit. \u201cYou have Big Tech and Hollywood,\u201d giving the president ammunition for Twitter, rallies, and his 2020 re-election bid.\n\nScott Bland contributed reporting.", "description": "Four fundraisers in the state netted a Trump fundraising committee $15 million.", "authors": ["Nancy Cook", "Jeremy B.
