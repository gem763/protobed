If Cory doesn\u2019t get $1.7 million by the end of the month, God\u2019s going to call his campaign home.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like that analogy, he offers another: It\u2019s the 2020 equivalent of National Lampoon\u2019s (in)famous \u201cBuy this magazine or we\u2019ll shoot this dog\u201d cover.\n\nDoes this mean that Booker\u2019s dropping out if he falls short of his target by October 1? There are three major Democratic gatherings in the first half of the month, Axios notes \u2014 an MSNBC town hall on the 2nd devoted to gun safety, a CNN town hall about LGBT issues on the 8th, and then the fourth Democratic debate on the 15th. Certainly Booker could afford to stick around for those and give \u2019em his best shot in hopes of making a splash. His campaign manager even acknowledged today that they could keep operating on their current scale if they had to, albeit stressing that that\u2019s not good enough to win anymore.\n\nNow that he\u2019s declared his campaign effectively hopeless if he misses his fundraising number, though, how would he justify his decision to continue if he misses it?\n\nWhile we invested early in building an outstanding organization in our Newark headquarters and the February early states, other campaigns have, in recent weeks, surpassed us in scale and begun spending on paid persuasion efforts online and on television. Between that and the likely increase in the DNC\u2019s debate-qualifying thresholds, which would require significant funds to meet, it is probable there are only four campaigns in this race with the money necessary to build and sustain the national organization needed to win the nomination\u2026 September is traditionally one of the strongest fundraising months for presidential campaigns. But after a surprisingly positive August, we simply have not witnessed the expected uptick in fundraising over the last three weeks. To put it bluntly, we need to scale our operation up in October and November to remain competitive and need a strong September to make that happen.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear: This isn\u2019t an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press,\u201d campaign manager Addisu Demissie added. I believe him. I don\u2019t think they would have frankly acknowledged that their fundraising thus far this month has been disappointing if this were a stunt. And certainly they wouldn\u2019t have staked the viability of the campaign on hitting a particular number knowing how the media will spin it now if Booker doesn\u2019t reach that number.\n\nThe most noteworthy line in the memo has to do with other campaigns. There are just four, Demissie claims, that have the financial wherewithal to compete nationally right now. That would be Biden, Bernie, Warren, and Pete Buttigieg, who led the field in fundraising in the second quarter. In other words, Demissie seems to think Kamala Harris is in a predicament not unlike Booker\u2019s, and even says elliptically at one point, \u201cCory Booker might not be in this race for much longer \u2014 the same is true for other important voices in the field.\u201d Is the Democratic Party of 2019 really on the brink of producing a final four in which all are white and three of the four are men? \u201cWe have the most diverse Democratic field in history and I think it would be a shame if that diversity was not reflected in the candidates who end up competing for the nomination once people actually start voting come next spring,\u201d said Demissie to the Daily Beast. Given the state of Harris\u2019s polling lately, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess right now whether she\u2019ll be in the race on January 1st.\n\nBooker dropping out would be a big deal because he\u2019s the only candidate outside the top tier who still has breakout potential, I think. Harris got her look from voters in late June and now seems to have been tossed away. Beto\u2019s tried everything he can think of to get noticed and continues to plod along at three or four percent. Castro seemed to have potential but then made everyone mad at him with his dig at Biden\u2019s forgetfulness at the last debate. Klobuchar is a total nonfactor and Yang is a gimmick candidate with his UBI pitch. Booker\u2019s the one person who seems like he might be broadly acceptable to different Democratic constituencies if he caught a few breaks \u2014 he\u2019s African-American, he\u2019s progressive-ish, he has charm on the stump. He\u2019s embraced some radical ideas, like O\u2019Rourke\u2019s mandatory buyback proposal, but has a knack for not seeming radical. If Biden suddenly imploded, Booker might find himself a destination for black voters currently supporting Grandpa Joe, which would instantly make him a top-tier candidate. But for whatever reason, he hasn\u2019t caught on. I checked RCP this afternoon and was surprised to find that Booker has never touched five percent in a national primary poll since April. Not once. He has reached four percent a few times but even that\u2019s infrequent.\n\nIf he has to quit because he can\u2019t raise enough dough and Harris continues to crawl along at four percent, it\u2019ll mean the two black candidates in the race \u2014 both well-known U.S. senators, both formidable when the race began \u2014 were sidelined months before voting began in Iowa. That would be genuinely shocking. And it would be a huge boon to Biden, who worried from the start about Booker and Harris potentially wooing away black voters from him. A final four of Joe, Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg, with the last three fighting over progressives and young adults and leaving Biden left to consolidate African-Americans and older voters, is about as favorable a battlefield as Biden could have hoped for when the race began.", "description": "\"This isn\u2019t an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/c-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
