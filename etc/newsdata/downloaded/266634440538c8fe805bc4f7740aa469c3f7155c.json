In my history class we are learning about the Renaissance (1300\u20131600), a period when da Vinci created this painting. I also painted my own version of the Mona Lisa when I was in Secondary One in my visual art class, but it wasn\u2019t so good. If I had the original in my bedroom, I could study it every day so that I could paint it better and improve my art skills.\n\nNicole Chow, 13, King Ling College\n\nI\u2019d choose a stone statue, like a gargoyle, to give my room an old, Gothic feel. I would be so proud to show people my room.\n\nHo Ka-yui, 11, Scientia Secondary School\n\nWhat celebrity wardrobe would you love to raid?\n\nI\u2019d plaster my wall with the pages of J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s book The Silmarillion. Literature is also art, right? Imagine opening your eyes every morning to a world of such beauty and fantasy, created entirely by words. That would be nothing short of a dream come true!\n\nYanni Chan Yan-ling, 14, Po Leung Kuk Choi Kai Yau School\n\nI\u2019d like to hang my favourite piece of artwork that I\u2019ve created. Having it on my wall would remind me that I can do anything if I believe in myself, and that you will get good results if you work hard. I think seeing that my work every day would make me feel proud of myself when I need a confidence boost.\n\nVanni Chan Wan-yan, 13, Methodist College\n\nI\u2019d choose something that I drew when I was younger. It would remind me of my childhood and give me a warm feeling every time I look at it. I could also compare it to my drawings now, to see how far my drawing skills have grown. It would surely inspire me to keep drawing.\n\nChloe Liu Kwan-yi, 13, Fung Kai Liu Man Shek Tong Secondary School\n\nWhich dinosaur would make the best pet?\n\nI\u2019d choose a sketch because I like how simple they are. I also prefer black and white art over things that are bright and colourful.\n\nJohnny Or Cheong-lim, 14, Scientia Secondary School\n\nI\u2019d pick an abstract art piece and I would like to try to understand what it means. I think abstract art is interesting because it doesn\u2019t try to represent something accurately, but instead uses colour and shapes to create a feeling or message. I think it\u2019s interesting to see how artists view the world differently.\n\nAndrey Tam, 18, STFA Seaward Woo College\n\nVincent van Gogh\u2019s The Starry Night. This painting makes me feel at peace. I find the way he painted the sky and stars so dazzling. I think it would also help me fall asleep at night.\n\nWong Pak-yiu, 17, STFA Seaward Woo College\n\nWhich video game character would be the best bodyguard?\n\nI\u2019d pick one of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings of water lilies. Water lilies are my favourite kind of flower and Monet painted them in the most beautiful way. I think the blue tones of his painting would calm and relax me, which is why I think it would be good to have it in my room where I do my homework.\n\nCarney Chang, 13, Sacred Heart Canossian College\n\nFor our next Top 10, tell us:\n\nWhich font best matches your personality and why?\n\nSend your answer, together with your name, age and school, to reporters.club@scmp.com with \u201cTop 10: Font\u201d in the subject field.
