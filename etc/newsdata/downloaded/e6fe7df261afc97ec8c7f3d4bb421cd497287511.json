Here\u2019s why that\u2019s misleading.]\n\nSo new, it seems, that in some ways, the unanswered questions have a way of feeling wildly outdated, conjuring up distant memories of the early 20th century, when automotive technology was brand new and America\u2019s fledgling driving culture was still being defined.\n\nAmong them: What sort of information should the station\u2019s signs communicate to the public? Better yet, does an EV charging station even need signage in the first place? EV owners can find charging stations anywhere in the world using a smartphone, after all. Perhaps most important: What exactly will people do with themselves during the 15- to 30-minute window when their vehicles are charging? Will they linger awkwardly? Grab a bite to eat nearby? Sit in their vehicles and work? Or relax in the station\u2019s new \u201cstate-of-the-art EV lounge\u201d?\n\nThe charging station is as much social experimentation as it is economic. If successful, Wade said, it could provide a model for replication elsewhere.\n\n\u201cNobody really knows what will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve entered new territory, and in some ways, that\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve been through a gas-powered version of this experiment before. The first drive-in service station opened in Pennsylvania in 1913, according to the Smithsonian. Before then, motorists frequented curbside pumps or purchased gasoline \u201cin cans from places like pharmacies and blacksmith shops and filled up themselves,\u201d the publication notes.\n\nNow, more than a century later, the front lines of a new EV revolution are unfolding not only among hypercompetitive engineers in Detroit and Silicon Valley but also in a quiet, free-spirited community known for its aging hippies in Teva sandals and its \u201cnuclear-free zone\u201d ordinance, a bastion of bike-friendly lanes with one of the state\u2019s highest walkability scores.\n\nFittingly, Depeswar Doley, a friendly Takoma Park fixture and RS Automotive\u2019s owner since 1997, said he doesn\u2019t know how much money the new charging stations will net his business \u2014 and doesn\u2019t particularly seem to care, so long as he can continue paying his staff a living wage while cutting ties with Big Oil.\n\n\u201cThe volume of our gasoline sales was very low, especially after 8 p.m.,\u201d Doley said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to get super rich from this, but it\u2019s good for the environment, and I\u2019m willing to take the risk.\u201d\n\nFortunately for Doley, the region is not without potential customers. In addition to an electric taxi service in nearby Washington, D.C., Maryland has nearly 21,000 registered EVs on its roads. Until now, Takoma Park\u2019s only two EV charging stations were being dominated by area taxis, Wade said.\n\nEven if taxis take advantage of the new pumps, Wade and Doley are expecting a public adjustment period. Gone are the pumps that American motorists have been using to pump their own gas at filling stations since 1905. They\u2019ve been replaced by handheld \u201cdispensers,\u201d which are attached to four flashy, nine-foot-tall charging stations with bright LED lights, touch-screens and credit card slots.\n\nThe machines gave Doley an excuse to replace the site\u2019s gargantuan, 20,000-gallon supply tanks, which were dug up and discarded this summer. Eventually, the plan is to outfit the station, as well as the garage and canopy that shields the charging stations, with solar panels.\n\nThe full renovation was funded by EVI as well as the Maryland Energy Administration, which provided a grant of $786,000.\n\n[\u2018People are freaking out.\u2019 Will electric vehicles doom your neighborhood auto mechanic?]\n\n\u201cMaryland is proud to be a national leader when it comes to clean and renewable energy, climate change and the promotion of electric infrastructure and vehicles,\u201d Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said in a news release. \u201cThis fully converted gas-to-electric charging station is a prime example of our administration\u2019s commitment to the environment and transportation.\u201d\n\nUnlike the rest of the state\u2019s service stations, RS Automotive won\u2019t have the familiar flip signs or LED displays that show varying fuel prices by grade.\n\nAn EV driver pulling up to a charging station likely will have been directed there \u2014 and made aware of the price \u2014 by an app on their smartphone like PlugShare, which maintains a database of EV charging stations around the world.\n\nAlso gone is some of the quick convenience drivers have come to expect when they pull up to the pump. Instead of filling up in less than five minutes, the 200-kilowatt charging stations will charge most EVs to 80 percent capacity in about 15 to 30 minutes. At that point, vehicles typically slow the charging rate to protect their batteries. The average cost for an 80 percent charge: about $5.10.\n\n\u201cThe final trickle of charging, the last 5 percent, can take an hour,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWe suggest you get to 80 percent to maximize the charging session.\u201d\n\nEV companies are already addressing this issue and will have larger battery packs and faster battery management systems, Wade added, but for now, most customers should allot the same amount of time toward a charging session that they would for, say, a thorough carwash.\n\nTo help them in this effort, RS Automotive has designed an EV lounge. Part waiting room and part living room, the lounge will offer complimentary coffee, water and restrooms, as well as several couches, chairs and televisions, including one screen displaying charging percentages at each station.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be different,\u201d Wade said. \u201cPeople are going to stay here a bit longer instead of just standing there holding the pump.\u201d\n\nOn a recent afternoon, a steady stream of Takoma Park residents strolled past the newly installed charging stations, some stopping to ask questions or snap photos. Not all of them have embraced the idea of longer wait times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the butt not to have gas here,\u201d said 86-year-old Andy Kelemen, wearing colorful suspenders and sandals, who has been coming to the gas station for more than three decades. \u201cYou better have that lounge well done, because I\u2019m not gonna stand here holding something for 20 minutes.\"\n\nBut down the block, the barbers at Roland\u2019s Unisex Barber Shop said they welcomed the idea of idling customers with time on their hands.\n\n\u201cI welcome anything that\u2019s going to add a pulse to the neighborhood,\u201d said 64-year-old barber Melvin Dawes, who said he remembers when the neighborhood was crisscrossed by dirt roads. \u201cIt\u2019s going to draw more people around here, and that enhances the rest of the businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty minutes is the perfect amount of time for a haircut,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen Doley was approached about converting to electric power, he said he was already looking for an excuse to sever his ties with oil and gasoline companies.\n\nHe was tired of lengthy contracts that included clauses that extended agreements when particular sales figures weren\u2019t met. If his electric experiment fails, he said, his new year-to-year lease means he can always reverse course. In the end, Doley said, embracing electric power wasn\u2019t so much about contracts or profit but the enthusiasm his 17-year-old daughter displayed when he initially floated the idea past her.\n\n\u201cMy daughter said, \u2018Dad, we gotta do it!' \u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s very passionate about Tesla and the environment, and we listened to her because she\u2019s the younger generation.\u201d\n\nMORE READING:\n\nThree years ago it could barely walk.
