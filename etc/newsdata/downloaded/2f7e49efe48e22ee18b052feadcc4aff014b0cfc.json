This compares with 2.0 percent for air transport, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization.\n\nThe IMO has in the meantime decided that from next year sulphur content in heavy fuel oil will be cut to 0.5 percent from 3.5 percent.\n\nThis is expected to be achieved by the use of \u201cscrubbers\u201d, or exhaust cleaning systems fitted to ships, that reduce the amount of sulphur emitted into the environment.\n\n\u2013 Reduce the speed \u2013\n\nMeanwhile, a large section of the French maritime sector recently voted to limit pollution by reducing ships\u2019 speed, a move supported by President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe ecological benefit is exponential: a tanker that lowers its speed from 12 to 11 knots (22.2 to 20.4 kilometres per hour) reduces its fuel consumption by 18 percent.\n\nThe reduction reaches 30 percent if it travels at only 10 knots, according to the French Ministry for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition.\n\n\u201cReducing vessel speed is one of the options on the table, but it\u2019s not the only one,\u201d said Hiroyuki Yamada, director of the marine division within the IMO.\n\n\u201cThis measure is pushed by some shipowners but not by all,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cOur role is to put in place effective measures that can provide more flexibility.\u201d\n\nShipowners are yet to be convinced, however.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s first and foremost a question of investment,\u201d said Philippe Renaud at CMA CGM Group.\n\n\u201cIf we reduce speed, we will need more ships.\u201d\n\nAnd to add \u201ca longer journey increases storage time and results in additional cost for customers\u201d, he noted.\n\nThe issue of reducing speeds will feature at the 75th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee between November 11-15.\n\nThe French maritime sector is hoping for a possible vote in favour of the measure in 2020, for implementation by 2023.\n\n\u201cThe shipping industry is going to change, because we have to address climate change,\u201d said Edmund Hughes, head of air pollution and energy efficiency at the IMO insisted last week.\n\n\u201cWe have to phase out CO2 emissions as soon as possible,\u201d he insisted.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Shipowners say they are trying to cut their heavy-polluting industry\u2019s impact on the environment by using cleaner energy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/0dc962_slower-ships-go-pollute-maritime-industry-seeks-solutions-limit-pollution-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
