Iran\u2019s continued maligned behavior, is part of its larger campaign to destabilize the Middle East and disrupt the global economy.\"\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels took responsibility for the strikes, but the Trump administration quickly blamed Iran for the attacks. Tehran has denied involvement.\n\nSaudi Arabia, as well as its neighbor the United Arab Emirates, requested international support to deter further attacks.\n\nThe U.S. military has about 70,000 personnel across the region, including naval deployments.\n\nUpdated: 2:04 p.m.", "description": "The Pentagon announced Friday that the U.S. will deploy additional personnel, aircraft and missile defense equipment to Saudi Arabia in response to Iranian aggression.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/saudiarabia_120618getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
