This year it's the sword. It's a new tradition,\" Drouin said.\n\nBrayden Schenn, Samuel Blais, and Vince Dunn scored for St. Louis, which absorbed its first regulation loss of the season.\n\n\"They played better, they played harder than us,\" Blues head coach Craig Berube said.\n\nMontreal goalie Carey Price made 26 saves. Jordan Binnington stopped 31 shots for the Blues.\n\nThe Canadiens earned their first regulation victory of the season.\n\nMontreal head coach Claude Julien gave his players the day off from skating Friday but had his players watch video to prepare for the Blues.\n\n\"We're fortunate enough that two (of our games) were at home,\" Julien said. \"These guys use a lot of energy night after night. They get on the plane, they get back home at one in the morning. They've got to play the next night. It's not easy, but you have to manage it,\"\n\nTatar tipped a bouncing puck past Binnington in the first-period to open the scoring. It was his second goal of the season.\n\nSchenn tied the game 1-1 with 2:03 left in the period, firing a shot that banked off the inside post past Price.\n\nLess than a minute later, Drouin responded with a goal of his own. He skated into the offensive zone and fired a shot past Binnington as two Blues defenders closed in. Drouin has at least a point in each game he's played this season.\n\nThe Blues tied the game in the second period when Blais scored a goal off a tight angle.\n\nDunn made it 3-2 by scoring a power-play goal 11 minutes later.\n\nSt. Louis' advantage lasted less than three minutes. Danault tied it at 15:35 of the second period.\n\nLehkonen scored the eventual winner for Montreal at 7:30 of the third period. He wrapped around Binnington and jammed the puck underneath the goalie's left pad, stabbing at it until it went in the net.\n\nGallagher and Domi added insurance goals in the third.\n\n\"We had it 3-3 going into the third,\" Schenn said. \"Didn't bring out our best effort in the third. We turned over pucks and they just wanted it more than us in the third period.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlues: At Nassau Coliseum to face the New York Islanders on Monday.\n\nCanadiens: Host the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
