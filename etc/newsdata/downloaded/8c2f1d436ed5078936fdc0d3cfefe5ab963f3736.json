Photo: Courtesy of Nickelodeon\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say pretty much everyone experiences dry skin, particularly in those months when summer begins to transition to fall. Rough, scaly patches typically pop up as temperatures drop and can be a pain to get rid of if you don\u2019t take steps to prevent them from happening in the first place. \u2018You want to avoid what we call alligator skin,\u2019 says dermatologist Dr. Sapna Palep, the founder of Spring Street Dermatology. \u2018Once it starts cracking like that, that\u2019s when eczema starts happening, that\u2019s when rashes start happening, and then just using moisturizer isn\u2019t going to cut it, so you\u2019ve got to take all the preventive measures.\u2019\n\nAccording to the dermatologists we spoke to, a big way to prevent dry skin is to make body lotion a staple in your daily routine year-round \u2014 not just in the fall and winter. But before we get into what lotions are best, there are some other best practices they told us that can help minimize scaly flare-ups. Some of them, according to dermatologist Dr. Shari Marchbein, are to avoid using stripping soaps (which typically include fragrances or SLS) and to take showers that last \u2018no longer than five minutes, with warm water only.\u2019 Cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Shereene Idriss agrees, saying that many people tend to overdo their body-care routines, thinking that extra cleansing will somehow benefit them in the long run. Another way to avoid stripping the skin of natural oils while showering, according to Idriss, is to \u2018limit the use of body wash and cleansers more or less to your private parts, your underarms, basically the places that really need it.\u2019 But if you\u2019re already taking these steps and your skin still feels rough, a body lotion can certainly go a long way to soothe it. Below, our six experts share their favorite body lotions for all types of dry skin, including ones suited for soothing eczema and keratosis pilaris, and even a clean option for the sustainability conscious.\n\nBest overall body lotion for dry skin\n\nCeraVe Moisturizing Cream This simple, fragrance-free cream came recommended by five of our six dermatologists as an effective, all-around hydrating treatment for dry skin. Marchbein generally says to \u2018look for moisturizers with ceramides to help replace those stripped away in dry skin, as well as humectants such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin,\u2019 and this formula has both ceramides and hyaluronic acid, she notes. Dermatologist Dr. Melissa K. Levin, the founder of Enti\u00e8re Dermatology, adds that \u2018hyaluronic acid is an incredibly effective humectant, which means it has the ability to attract hydration to the skin\u2019s surface but also retain that moisture as well.\u2019 The CeraVe cream\u2019s thick texture feels cool to the touch, immediately soothing irritated skin upon application, according to Levin. Palep adds: \u2018It\u2019s just a good staple; what\u2019s not to love?\u2019 To get the best results, Marchbein suggests applying a liberal amount (which seems reasonable at \u00a314 a bottle) within 60 seconds of getting out of the shower, because that\u2019s when your pores will be slightly open, allowing your skin to easily absorb the cream\u2019s moisture. \u00a314 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest body lotion for extremely dry skin\n\nAv\u00e8ne XeraCalm Lipid-Replenishing Cream For extremely dry skin, four dermatologists recommend using this exceptionally rich cream to prevent cracking and splitting (and to treat those conditions once they occur). The fragrance-free formula includes vitamin E and ceramides, making it \u2018extremely hydrating,\u2019 according to Idriss. Dermatologist Dr. Annie Chiu is also \u2018a big fan\u2019 of Av\u00e8ne\u2019s cream because of its density, telling us that \u2018severely dry skin typically calls for a thicker cream, balm, or ointment rather than a lotion because they can trap in moisture better.\u2019 Dr. Jennifer MacGregor, a dermatologist at Union Square Laser Dermatology, also recommends the Av\u00e8ne cream for extremely dry skin, noting that anyone with severe dryness should steer clear of \u2018lotions marketed for rough and bumpy skin, because they have peeling agents (lactic or glycolic alpha hydroxy acids) and these are not good.\u2019 \u00a330 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) body lotion for extremely dry skin\n\nEucerin Advanced Repair Dry Skin Lotion If you don\u2019t like the thought of a thick cream on your super-dry skin, Palep recommends this, which is thinner than a lot of other formulas for extreme dryness but promises to lock in moisture for up to 48 hours. (She\u2019s not the only derm who likes it; others previously told us this is a super-hydrating product for dry skin.) \u2018I\u2019ve seen it wipe out alligator skin, which is hard to do,\u2019 Palep says. MacGregor agrees, but cautions that because this formula contains lactic acid (in addition to ceramides and hyaluronic acid), it should really be used be used to prevent extremely dry skin from forming, rather than to treat cracks or splits that have already occurred. \u2018It has mild peeling agents to smooth rough follicles,\u2019 she explains regarding why it\u2019s better for preventative use. \u00a316 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest body lotion for dry sensitive skin\n\nVanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream Both Palep and Idriss give this cream their stamp of approval as a go-to for soothing dry sensitive skin. Idriss told us she always urges taking \u2018the time time to figure out\u2019 what skin may be reacting to instead of \u2018blindly saying \u201cI have sensitive skin,\u201d\u2019 but notes that this stuff generally works for most types of dry sensitive skin because \u2018it\u2019s free of almost everything.\u2019 She adds: \u2018If you\u2019re extremely sensitive, or don\u2019t have the time to figure it out, then this is probably a good go-to product.\u2019 \u00a320 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest body lotion for eczema\n\nAveeno Eczema Therapy Daily Moisturizing Cream for Sensitive Skin, Soothing Lotion With Colloidal Oatmeal Chiu describes eczema as a condition \u2018characterized by irritated, chronically itchy skin,\u2019 noting that it can be notoriously finicky and tough to treat. She (along with many of our pros) says that eczema patients should consult with their dermatologist about any prescription products they may use. But, short of a prescription, Chiu, Idriss, and Levin (who says she has eczema herself) all recommend using this on dry skin caused by eczema. \u2018It\u2019s fragrance-free, enriched with ceramides and oatmeal \u2014 and oatmeal is known to be really helpful for people with eczema because it helps calm inflammation, and it really is very long lasting,\u2019 explains Idriss. Levin also notes that this has glycerin, which \u2018not only is it a powerhouse ingredient because it really knows how to pull in water, but it\u2019s not greasy.\u2019 The latter detail may be especially appealing to the eczema-prone like herself, Levin adds, because they \u2018are so used to using greasy stuff, they actually tolerate and enjoy this one.\u2019 Plus, Aveeno made this lotion a tad liquidy, allowing it to blend quickly and smoothly into the skin without the incessant kneading that some thicker lotions require. \u00a313 at ebay Buy\n\nBest drugstore body lotion for dry skin\n\nSt. Ives Soothing Body Lotion, Oatmeal and Shea Butter All six dermatologists we talked to noted it\u2019s important to hydrate the skin year-round, not just in the months when most typically experience dryness. Marchbein suggests St. Ives. Meant for daily use, it includes ingredients like glycerin that help quickly repair dry, flaking skin, along with naturally hydrating and calming shea butter and oatmeal (which, as Idriss told us, can be very soothing). \u00a317 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) drugstore body lotion for dry skin\n\nJergens Extra Healing Dry Skin Moisturizer For a widely available, all-season body lotion that tackles normal to mildly dry skin and won\u2019t break the bank, Idriss recommends this body lotion from Jergens because \u2018it\u2019s affordable, light-feeling, and absorbs really quickly, so you don\u2019t feel tacky after using it. Plus, it works.\u2019 [Editor\u2019s note: Idriss and Jergens share a PR firm, but she does not work with the brand in any official or unofficial capacity.] For \u00a310, you can buy this jumbo 21-ounce bottle, which should last for a while \u2014 likely at least until it\u2019s time to switch to your heavier creams. \u00a310 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest exfoliating body lotions for dry skin\n\nCetaphil Moisturizing Cream Sometimes you might need a lotion with an exfoliant that helps scrub away rough patches as it moisturises. If that sounds like you, Levin suggests this cream from Cetaphil with lactic acid \u2014 \u2018a very nice, very gentle exfoliating ingredient.\u2019 She says this not only helps to moisturise but locks in that moisture using another \u2018bonus, almond oil,\u2019 which works like \u2018clingfilm, and basically locks moisture in.\u2019 Levin does caution that this also contains propylene glycol, a preservative many say is \u2018bad for you,\u2019 but actually isn\u2019t that bad, according to her. \u2018We need preservatives in skin-care products so that they don\u2019t go bad. For some patients, very rarely, it can cause allergic reactions. But it\u2019s super, super, super, super-rare and not an ingredient I think people need to fully stay away from.\u2019 \u00a319 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest clean body lotion for dry skin\n\nN\u00e9cessaire The Body Lotion Finding clean and natural beauty products can be tricky, according to Idriss, who notes that \u2018there\u2019s no universal definition for what natural means.\u2019 She adds that, typically, the term \u2018clean\u2019 indicates a brand has formulated a product without any toxic ingredients (like SLS, fragrances, or other synthetic materials), which is exactly how she describes this lotion from Necessaire. Idriss says her clients rave about it, and she recommends it to anyone practicing clean beauty who is also looking to soothe dry skin. \u2018It\u2019s fragrance-free, enriched with a bunch of omegas and vitamins, and formulated without controversial ingredients,\u2019 she explains, adding that the lotion is relatively light, sinking in quickly and providing quick relief. \u00a320 at eBay UK Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
