With the president delivering the keynote speech at the leading conference on American shale energy, the activists gathered to protest ... white nationalism!\n\n(Via the Daily Mail) Activists from the group Bend the Arc: Pittsburgh began arriving at Gateway T Station a 8.30am on Wednesday carrying signs and railing against what they called the president's message of hate. 'You can't comb over racism,' one hand-written sign read, seemingly poking fun at the president's hairstyle. 'Mister Rogers' neighborhood is no place for hate,' another declared, referring to the iconic children's show set in Pittsburgh. The demonstrators were confronted by a large number of police officers in riot gear, who ordered them to disperse or face arrest. When the activists failed to clear the street minutes later, police began taking them into custody one by one.\n\nAt least 14 people were arrested. Protestors also disrupted Trump's speech by chanting \"Trump endangers Jews.\"\n\nAt one point, the president stopped his speech to address the protestors. \"They don't know who they're dealing with. They just don't understand. Alright, go home to mom! Explain to mom that you tried to take on powerful people, and many of them physically as well as mentally. That's not a good thing to do. Not in this room.\" He then told the crowd, \"Make sure you don't hurt them. Please!\"\n\n\"Go back to mom\" - A protester tried to interrupt President Donald Trump during an event in Pittsburgh today. pic.twitter.com/mww77i9hEp \u2014 FOX61 (@FOX61News) October 23, 2019\n\nFour demonstrations were held in response to Trump's appearance, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nThe first of the demonstrations, organized by Bend the Arc and held at the Gateway Station, was called called the 'Solidarity Defeats White Nationalism' rally.
