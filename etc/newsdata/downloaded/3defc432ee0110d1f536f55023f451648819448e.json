There his work was designing and installing the gas chambers and ovens that were used to kill millions.\u201d\n\nKammler\u2019s helped \u201cmake evil efficient,\u201d said Marlow.\n\n\u201cThat was their goal,\u201d concurred Reuter. \u201cThey mechanized death, essentially, and they made it as efficient as possible, and Hans Kammler, as we show in Hidden Nazi \u2026 was terrific at it. That\u2019s probably the wrong word.\u201d\n\nReuter explained, \u201c[Hans Kammler] designed the standard concentration camp barracks, first of all. We have architectural drawings that bear his signature. He overruled an underling\u2019s design for brick barracks in favor of wooden barracks, which were obviously cheaper to make but not as warm. [Prisoners] suffered through the elements through wooden barracks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have an architectural drawing where the capacity of the barracks is noted in the margins as \u2018550 people,\u2019 and it\u2019s stricken through \u2014 and that would already be crammed full of people \u2014 that number is written over with \u2018774,\u2019 so with the stroke of a pencil, he increases the barracks\u2019 capacity, and the misery \u2014 by 30 percent for each barracks,\u201d noted Reuters.\n\nReuter remarked, \u201c[Hans Kammler] made ceaseless visits to these camps that we have documented through excruciating work by my researchers, daily sometimes, weekly changes. He was in charge of the metes and bounds of these camps, the design, layout, but not just the sort of geography of it, the barracks, and the concentration camp ovens and gas chambers, so he was really in it up to his neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir goal was to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible,\u201d said Reuter of the Nazis\u2019 intent to work their prisoners \u2014 who were de facto slave laborers \u2014 to death. \u201c[Their] overall goal \u2026 was to work those people and work them so ruthlessly [so as to] grind them to dust, really.\u201d\n\nReuter went on, \u201cBy the end of the war, [Hans Kammler] was in charge of all Germany\u2019s secret weapons, which included nuclear research, shaped charges, lasers, anti-tank guns, but also Germany\u2019s famous \u2018vengeance weapons,\u2019 the V-1 and V-2 rockets, and about a hundred other, lesser-known rockets that people haven\u2019t paid attention to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anybody in a wartime environment operate a weapon cradle-to-grave literally from the drawing board to firing it at the enemy,\u201d shared Reuter. \u201cThat\u2019s how pervasive [Hans Kammler\u2019s] power was.\u201d\n\nKammler revealed some new findings from his forthcoming book.\n\n\u201c[There] was a high-level meeting in 1944 among the highest-level German government officials, army officials, and industrial leaders,\u201d Reuter said. \u201cAt that meeting, everyone was told to offshore all their assets. This is as the war was already known to be lost. \u2018Take all your gold, all your technology, everything you have, preserve it for later, dump it into companies outside Germany, and preserve it for a Fourth Reich,\u2019 and that was a meeting that happened almost a year before the war ended.\u201d\n\nReuter added, \u201cWe also found what I thought as an astonishing CIA report. Eight years after the war, in 1953, the CIA was terrified of a Fourth Reich in South America. There were enclaves of Germans in South America. Again, this seems like science fiction, but there were thousands of visas issued [and] tens of thousands of Germans in South America.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis [CIA] report documents the scientists down [in South America], their technology, the weapons experts they had down there, a German chamber of commerce, a true German enclave that was funded and populated and ready to rise again,\u201d concluded Reuter. \u201cIt never did.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "description": "Nazi officials preserved assets, weapons research, and personnel for a Fourth Reich that never came to be, explained Dean Reuter.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/adolf-hitler.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
