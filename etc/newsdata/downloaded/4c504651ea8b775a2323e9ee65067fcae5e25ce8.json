In fact, he had already turned around and started back toward the dugout \u2013 it was confusing to both Odorizzi and fans in attendance alike (reports from the stadium say Puig was booed).\n\nClick here to watch the play.\n\nYasiel Puig apologizes to Terry Francona, Carlos Santana\n\nIn the clip, Indians manager Terry Francona and catcher Carlos Santana approach Puig when he sits down in the dugout. After the game, Puig revealed that he apologized to them for not running.\n\n\u201cSantana was giving me advice that I need to run out every play and I\u2019m 100 percent with him and said sorry to him and said sorry to Tito. I\u2019m supposed to run on that play. I don\u2019t know what happened in my mind,\u201d Puig said, according to MLB.com\u2019s Mandy Bell. \"I stayed at the plate not running. Tomorrow is a new day and I need to run every play. That\u2019s not going to happen again.\u201d\n\nFrancona did not pull Puig from the game \u2014 a response we\u2019ve seen before in cases regarding lack of hustle on the field. The move briefly paid off: Puig hit a game-tying double in his next at-bat and doubled again later on.\n\nWith Odorizzi taking the ball to first himself, Puig was effectively guaranteed to be out. Should he have run anyway? The unwritten rules say yes. But what say you?\n\nYasiel Puid apologized for remaining in the batter's box after hitting a ground ball back to Twins pitcher Jake Odorizzi.
