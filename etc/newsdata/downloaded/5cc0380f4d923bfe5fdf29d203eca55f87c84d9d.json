Ouch.\n\nThe rapper, real name Tyler Gregory Okonma, revealed what he thought about Eminem\u2019s music on Rick Rubin\u2019s Broken Record podcast, and it\u2019s safe to say he didn\u2019t mince his words\u2026\n\nWhen asked whether there were any rappers who he listened to specifically for the lyrics, he chose Eminem, but slammed the beats he raps over.\n\nHe explained: \u2018Some people who hear a smooth beat like, \u201cI\u2019ma going f**king yell on it! I\u2019mma do this\u201d. They\u2019re more thinking of saying cool s**t rather than making a good song\u2026\n\n\u2018Eminem picked some of the worst beats ever.

He felt pressured because people got offended for me. Don\u2019t get offended for me.\n\n\u2018We were playing Grand Theft Auto when we heard that. We rewound it and were like, \u201cOh.\u201d And then kept playing.\u2019\n\nEminem later admitted he regretted using the slur, explaining: \u2018In my quest to hurt him, I realise that I was hurting a lot of other people by saying it.\u2019\n\nTyler has since returned to the UK for the first time since he was banned from the country in 2015, and is currently in the middle of his international Igor tour.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
