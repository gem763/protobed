Invesco\u2019s popular tech giant, the QQQ Trust QQQ, -0.42% , which is the fifth-biggest fund, has also lost money this year.\n\nSee: Tired of market turbulence? These ETFs offer to define your financial outcomes\n\nMeanwhile, some of the smaller of the top 20 are seeing outsize interest relative to their stature. \u201cThe growth in assets has taken another twist and looks to be moving into smaller ETFs that cover very specific investment segments, like USMV for minimum volatility,\u201d the Jefferies analysts said.\n\nUSMV, which MarketWatch profiled over the summer, is the ticker for the iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF USMV, -0.59% . As markets keep churning, it\u2019s picked up a whopping $9.6 billion so far this year, increasing its assets by 28%.\n\nHere\u2019s a reminder on why all the funds profiled here are sponsored by ishares, Vanguard, or SPDR, the trade name for State Street Global Advisors:\n\nSee: 3 fund managers may soon control nearly half of all corporate voting power, researchers warn\n\nNone of the other top 20 funds has seen anything like that kind of move, according to Jefferies\u2019 calculations, but Vanguard\u2019s Dividend Appreciation ETF VIG, -0.24% has gained $2.1 billion assets or 5.5%, and its High Dividend Yield fund VYM, -0.10% has gained $1.1 billion, 4.3% of its size. That\u2019s a reminder that investors seeking income have to look to stocks, not bonds. As MarketWatch reported in August, the dividend yield for the S&P 500 briefly outstripped the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds.\n\nOn the topic of \u201cbond proxies,\u201d or stocks that mimic bonds by offering relatively safe business models and a stream of income, the Jefferies analysts also note that over 20% of shares outstanding are owned by investors in passively-managed instruments.\n\n\u201cHowever, real estate and utilities are really influenced by the passive crowd with 30% and 25% of shares owned by passive,\u201d the Jefferies team wrote. \u201cIn small caps, ETFs own 10+% of shares out alone. If we get a reversal or meltdown in ETFs/passive, these two sectors will come under significant pressure given how little trading volume occurs.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stock-market investors\u2019 appetite for \u2018bond proxies\u2019 is waning", "description": "The types of funds that investors are favoring and pulling money out of shows a desire to hedge against volatility and to pick up some income.", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GO674_cashmo_ZG_20180821131511.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
