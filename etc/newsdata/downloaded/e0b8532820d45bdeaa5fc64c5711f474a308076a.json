Her stints in hit musicals like \u201cWicked\u201d and the 2015 revival of \u201cOn the Twentieth Century\u201d have garnered her a diverse audience that extends far beyond the Manhattan theater scene.\n\nBut when Chenoweth hit the stage of New York\u2019s Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in November 2016 for her acclaimed solo concert, \u201cMy Love Letter to Broadway,\u201d she met an unusual challenge \u2015 that is, she had to unite viewers from both sides of the political spectrum following a contentious U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cHalf my audience was devastated and half of them were thrilled, which says a lot about where we are in our country,\u201d Chenoweth told HuffPost. Faced with that division, she began to approach the gig in a neo-vaudevillian fashion by vowing to deliver \u201ca night of fun for all viewers,\u201d regardless of their civic allegiance.\n\nRich Fury/Invision/AP Kristin Chenoweth (left) enlisted Ariana Grande for a new take on Lesley Gore\u2019s 1964 classic, \u201cYou Don\u2019t Own Me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018We have a new president today. Some of us didn\u2019t vote that way, [but] let us still enter this time with hope,\u2019\u201d said Chenoweth, a Tony Award winner for her performance as Sally in the 1999 revival of \u201cYou\u2019re a Good Man, Charlie Brown.\u201d The no-nonsense gesture turned out to be successful. \u201cAbout halfway through, I could see people letting go of the heaviness many of them brought into the theater,\u201d she said.\n\nNearly three years later, that experience continues to inform Chenoweth\u2019s work, including her new album, \u201cFor The Girls.\u201d The 12-song collection includes tunes written or made famous by Judy Garland, Dolly Parton and Carole King, among other artists, and it doesn\u2019t address politics in any overt way. Still, Chenoweth has come to see the album, which drops Friday, as her response to the current political climate, in that it puts the words and voices of strong, empowered women front and center.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t set out to make a female empowerment record. It just happened,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was all music I\u2019d grown up with, [but] with what\u2019s going on in our world right now ... it evolved into that. I just wanted to celebrate women, especially those who came before me, and tip my hat to them, say thank you.\u201d\n\nJeff Vespa via Getty Images Chenoweth (right) also teamed up with Dolly Parton for a duet version of \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d\n\nTrue to form, Chenoweth infuses fresh, if pleasantly retro, energy into songs like Garland\u2019s \u201cThe Man That Got Away\u201d and Barbra Streisand\u2019s \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d But \u201cFor The Girls\u201d also afforded her the chance to team up with a number of powerhouse performers from varying genres.\n\nShe teamed up with Parton for \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d reimagined here as a diva duet. Ariana Grande makes a guest appearance for a new take on Lesley Gore\u2019s 1964 classic, \u201cYou Don\u2019t Own Me,\u201d as do Jennifer Hudson and Reba McEntire on \u201cI\u2019m A Woman,\u201d first recorded in 1962. (Catch \u201cYou Don\u2019t Own Me\u201d in the video above.)\n\n\u201cAs the album evolved, I felt like I needed some songstresses, and I needed some of my favorites,\u201d Chenoweth said. Given that her vocal style have long been compared to Parton\u2019s, reaching out to the country legend was particularly emotional.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d say yes, but she did,\u201d Chenoweth said. \u201cWhen I found out, I cried. I always thought, \u2018One day, I want to sing that song.\u2019 Little did I know that I\u2019d be singing it with the queen herself, the woman who wrote it.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, Chenoweth\u2019s relationship with Grande is a maternal one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched her grow up,\u201d she said of the Grammy winner, with whom she co-starred in 2016\u2019s \u201cHairspray Live!\u201d on NBC. \u201cI know what kind of singer she is. More importantly, I know what kind of a person she is. I haven\u2019t had to deal with the level of fame that she\u2019s had, but I know she\u2019s an old soul, and I can relate to that.\u201d\n\nBruce Glikas via Getty Images In 2016, Chenoweth performed her acclaimed solo concert, \u201cMy Love Letter to Broadway,\u201d at New York\u2019s Lunt-Fontanne Theatre.\n\n\u201cFor The Girls\u201d marks the start of a busy fall for Chenoweth. In November, she will reunite with longtime director Richard Jay-Alexander for eight concerts at New York\u2019s Nederlander Theatre in support of the album. She returns to the small screen opposite Scott Wolf in Hallmark\u2019s \u201cA Christmas Love Story,\u201d a project she describes as \u201cvery close to my heart\u201d in terms of its subject matter. Though mum on specifics, she added, \u201cWhen people see it, they\u2019ll know.\u201d\n\nNo doubt a return to Broadway is in Chenoweth\u2019s future, as the singer-actor is hotly linked to a forthcoming bio-musical of televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker as well as a stage adaptation of the 1992 comedy \u201cDeath Becomes Her.\u201d\n\nAs far as \u201cFor The Girls\u201d is concerned, Chenoweth is hopeful that her fans will see the album as her testament to empowered, era-defining women who pushed the boundaries of music and self-expression through raw talent and ambition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still an old school artist who looks at an album from A to Z, telling a story,\u201d Chenoweth said. \u201cI want [audiences] to see that I love the women that came before me, and I also want singers like Dolly, Reba, Jennifer and Ariana to know the respect and love I have for them, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one\u2019s for the girls,\u201d she added.", "description": "The \"Wicked\" star enlists Ariana Grande and Dolly Parton for her new album, which honors artists who have influenced her journey.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8d31c721000034005efd5a.jpeg?cache=43gjbj75un&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
