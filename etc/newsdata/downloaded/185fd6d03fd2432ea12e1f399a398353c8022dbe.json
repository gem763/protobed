She is pictured outside the Taunton branch after it relocated to East Reach\n\nAsked why she hasn't considered retiring, Pauline said: 'KFC haven't done anything wrong for me and I think they are good to work for.\n\n'I haven't had any complaints. If I ever had a problem about certain things, I spoke to my manager.\n\n'I do like working with people here and I can't say I don't. We have a good little group here.\n\n'I love my job. Customers I have always spoken to and I have been friendly with and I have always tried to help as best I can and this job has always suited my life.'\n\n'I do want to say thank you to my customers that I have been friends with and I really appreciate it.'\n\nPauline began working for KFC in the 1970s to support her friend at the former branch on East Reach.\n\nShe explained: 'I started with a friend of mine called Roz who worked at East Reach in the old KFC.\n\n'She was a bit nervous of going into the old building because it was creepy.\n\nShe has worked in almost every role possible at the chain, starting as a cleaner and going on to be a cashier, supervisor and then team leader\n\nShe asked the general manager, Mr Walker, if it was OK for me to come into the store and work with her. He agreed.\n\n'I worked for a few months with Roz and when she decided to work on the front serving customers with her sister, Rose, I did the cleaning temporally.'\n\nAfter initially signing up as a cleaner, Pauline became a cashier and took hungry customer's orders before helping to cook the food.\n\nShe recalled how cooking methods were different nearly 40 years ago, remarking: 'We cooked the hot wings in the pots in those days and breaded them all up and put the BBQ sauce on.'\n\nDuring her employment, she worked her way up to becoming a manager for two-and-half years.\n\nWhen the East Reach branch closed, she moved to the current KFC on East Street and decided to take it a little easier and become a team member.\n\nPauline says a typical shift sees her serve customers, prepare orders, look after customers and clean the restaurant.\n\nShe claims she always aims to 'help them out to the best I can', adding: 'A lot of people say, 'don't ever leave'. They say you know what you're talking about, you help me out, and you're always friendly.\n\n'I always make sure I get peoples' orders right. I think that is a good thing for the customers.'\n\nShe added: 'When I go out for a break, children would shout over to me 'Hello Miss KFC' and call me 'Mum' and 'Nan'.\n\nThe 68-year-old (pictured with general manager Alice Yarde) boasts a celebrity status in Taunton, with locals referring to her as 'Miss KFC', 'Mum' and 'Nan'\n\n'Even on a Friday and Saturday night here, you get customers and some young boys start singing my name out and they are pleased to see me.\n\n'When I'm not in, they (the customers) are asking where I am. If I've been out, I get people asking why I'm not working tonight.'\n\nPauline said she would do 'anything' for customers and recalled a time where someone said she felt 'intimidated by some youngsters' and couldn't enter the store.\n\nTo help her, Pauline delivered the food to her outside so she wouldn't have to come in.\n\nThe customer's reaction touched Pauline, as she recalled: 'She thanked me very much. She sent a letter to say thank you.\n\n'The next time she came in, she gave me a box of chocolates which meant a lot for me.'\n\nThe 68-year-old also revealed her favourite food at KFC is either popcorn chicken or a chicken zinger burger.\n\nThe store's general manager, Alice Yarde, said she's known Pauline ever since she started working at KFC in 1992.\n\nShe said: 'I just think she's a treasure. I cannot imagine a day being here without her.\n\n'I know obviously I will be one day. But when I first started here, she was my second mum.\n\n'If I have any problems, Pauline is always someone I would be able to talk to.'\n\nCustomers say Pauline's smile and friendly banter are what keeps them coming back\n\nAlice praised Pauline for her customer service and how she always seems to know what the customer wants to order.\n\nShe said: 'You need to see her with the customers to see how good she is and how she is with customers.\n\n'Pauline knows (what they would order) and you think of how many people she serves, she will know.'\n\nAlice recalled: 'Before I went on a first date with my husband, I asked Pauline 'is that boy alright, what do you think?' because she knows everyone in Taunton. She said 'yeah he's alright'.'\n\nPauline interjected with: 'I was serving on the till and he said 'I fancy that woman and I want to take her out'.\n\n'I said 'don't talk to me, speak to the young lady there!'. She was so shy and they later got together and got married.'\n\nAlice called Pauline her 'second mum' and said their shifts together are always fun.\n\n'We just have a laugh', she said.\n\n'It's not the easiest job in the world and we don't work the greatest hours but if we're working with good people and having banter with the customers, time flies and it's just good fun.'\n\nAlice said her colleagues 'just adore her' and 'love working with Pauline' and everyone sees her as a 'second mum'.\n\n'Some young lads who normally would not be that responsive to the older generation, they would say 'Pauline what can I get for you' or 'let me make your tea' and they are just lovely. It's delightful to see.'\n\nWhen asked how she would describe Alice in one word, she said: 'The main thing would be 'loyal'.\n\n'She is loyal and fun.'", "description": "Pauline Richards started working at the East Street branch in Taunton, Somerset, in 1978.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/13/20130122-0-image-a-54_1571918650629.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
