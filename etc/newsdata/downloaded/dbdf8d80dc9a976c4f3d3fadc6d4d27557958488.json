Co-owners Diane and John MacPherson added a chef and expanded their hours to include Wednesday night in their beguiling, 20-seat dining room in Rappahannock County. Otherwise, those fortunate to have visited before can expect a scene similar to dinners past: five courses offered at a single seating by the same people who prepared the meal.\n\nFarmers let the restaurant know what they have on Sunday. The staff noodles ideas on Tuesday before writing a menu. The only constant from week to week: \u201cThe food has to be simple, honest, delicious and beautiful,\u201d says John, a chef. Hence a summertime ode to tomatoes served fresh, charred, in a consomm\u00e9 and as a roasted p\u00e2t\u00e9. And scarlet tenderloin rounded out with golden pommes Anna, charred cucumber relish and a pale yellow onion soubise.\n\nLovely nibbles and sublime desserts start and finish the dream, narrated in part by Diane, the gracious general manager. Coming soon: black walnut custard tart with compressed apples and smoked yogurt. And maybe goat from a local purveyor in Madison. Plenty of restaurants serve delicious food in attractive spaces. Three Blacksmiths suggests you\u2019re enjoying dinner in the home of friends \u2014 friends with superb taste.\n\n3 stars (Excellent)\n\nThree Blacksmiths: 20 Main St., Sperryville, Va. 540-987-5105. threeblacksmiths.com .\n\nOpen: Dinner Wednesday through Saturday.\n\nPrices: $128 per person.\n\nSound check: 70 decibels / Conversation is easy.\n\nThe Top 10 restaurants of 2019:\n\n10.

(Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)\n\nGet to Three Blacksmiths \u2014 if you can\n\n(Good/Excellent)\n\nThe lone complaint I\u2019ve ever heard about this Sperryville sensation concerns the challenge of securing a table. \u201cI just got in \u2014 in October,\u201d a grateful friend emailed recently. The hardest ticket around is open just three dinners a week, seats no more than 20 diners, and is cooked and served by a team of four, plus a dishwasher. (Co-owners John and Diane MacPherson are the hosts with the most.) Everyone eats the same five-course meal at the same time, although special requests are taken into consideration. Vegetarians, you\u2019re welcome. As March gave way to April, diners sat down to some lovely hors d\u2019oeuvres (French onion soup rethought as a crouton!) and a perfectly paced meal of trout set on a sauce of yogurt and leeks, a carrot flattered with bright coins of kumquat and a crumble of pistachio and chile, purse-like manti stuffed with goat cheese \u2026 well, you get my drift. The dreamy dinner feels of the moment (burnt onion syrup with the fish, spruce oil to enliven the pasta) and closes with hazelnut genoise and toasted buckwheat ice cream. Pro tip: Thursdays are slightly easier to reserve than Friday or Saturday, and wannabe diners can book out as far as 203 days (29 weeks). Worth the trip? Definitely \u2014 worth any hassle, too.\n\nThe Top 10 new restaurants of 2019:\n\n10. Gravitas\n\n9. Little Havana\n\n8. Sushi Nakazawa\n\n7. Estuary\n\n6. St. Anselm\n\n5.

(Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)\n\nNo. 9. Three Blacksmiths\n\n(Good/Excellent)\n\nSeveral freshly minted restaurants in Rappahannock County practically made me a commuter there this summer. In seasons going forward, I know I\u2019ll be checking back with the smallest and most endearing of them every chance I get. Former innkeepers John and Diane MacPherson traded house guests for thrice-weekly dinner patrons with Three Blacksmiths, whose tiny staff cooks not far from where you\u2019re sitting, then takes turns delivering the food. Your only decision once you prepay for the five-course menu is whether to lick your plate clean. It\u2019s hard not to in the face of red pepper soup with a float of absinthe cream; sorghum-glossed quail with rings of squash and streaks of husk cherry jus; and an Asian pear crisp set off with creme fraiche gelato. No two meals are alike. But the constants include pleasing combinations of ingredients \u2014 shaved local apples coaxed into a fetching tent with Appalachian cheese \u2014 and charming, unhurried service in the wood-bound dining room, thanks to a single, 7 p.m. seating for 16.\n\nThe Top 10 restaurants of 2018:\n\n10.

(Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)\n\nHouse-made pasta with mushrooms. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)\n\nAs much as John and Diane MacPherson enjoyed running the Foster Harris House in Washington, Va., after 13 years of hosting epicurean bike tours, feeding guests both breakfast and dinner, the couple decided they wanted more flexibility in their lives. Last year, they sold their business and spent two months in Europe, where they collected ideas for their true passion: a restaurant \u2014 hold the beds, the bikes and the lack of privacy.\n\nTheir ideal came to life in June, with the opening of Three Blacksmiths in Sperryville. The restaurant, warm in wood and illuminated with candles, serves a mere 16 guests at a single 7 p.m. seating Thursday through Saturday. The area\u2019s small talent pool explains the limited audience and dates. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be in the business of constantly hiring and training,\u201d says Diane MacPherson. But more than that, \u201cwe love being in touch with our customers.\u201d\n\n[A taste of the nation\u2019s most popular restaurants reveals the one ingredient they have in common]\n\nSure enough, John, the self-taught head chef, and his wife, the smile at the entrance, take turns delivering the five-course dinner along with sous-chefs Ethan Taylor and Connor Hartman, the owners\u2019 only employees. The reality that they don\u2019t have a second seating means diners get to do more than hear a quick food description. And the proximity of the open kitchen, distinguished with a wood hearth, to the handful of tables only increases the intimacy.\n\n\n\nSeating at the restaurant is capped at 16 with a single 7 p.m. seating. The restaurant, which sources its food locally, is only open three nights a week. (Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cEvery table is a chef\u2019s table,\u201d says my companion, scraping a sauce of saffron-colored coconut milk from a bowl containing a single buttery scallop and shards of rice cracker. The crisp garnish is made with the rice that sticks to the bottom of the pan, John MacPherson tells us. A second course, called Soup \u2019n Salad, gathers cherry tomatoes on a mound of lemon ricotta set in refreshing gazpacho. Thin slices of house-baked rye, veined with pecan and sunflower seeds, are presented atop a little dish of stones. \u201cThey\u2019re local, too,\u201d jokes the chef, nodding in the direction of the nearby Thornton River from which he retrieved (and washed) them. The regular butter is superb; even better is the fat infused with honey and basil.\n\nPasta follows: piegatelle folded over itself, surrounded by funghi both fleshy (maitake mushrooms) and aromatic (summer truffles) in a broth infused with porcinis. Brick House Gamay Noir from Oregon is Ginger Rogers to the pasta\u2019s Fred Astaire: a starry match, and part of the optional $70 wine pairing. There\u2019s no bar, per se, although the staff can make a martini or Manhattan if someone asks.\n\nThe portions are sensible. When a length of duck breast is set down, you have room to enjoy it. Seared to a crackle on the grill, the duck comes with escorts of toasted farro, chard braised in beer, snap peas for color and a blackberry sauce that veers from sweet to sour: as perfect a concert as I\u2019ve witnessed this summer. Tres leches cake, its texture reminiscent of angel food, is served as bite-size pieces with grill-kissed nectarines and ice cream that gets its smokiness from slivers of wood that have been singed and steeped in milk.\n\n\n\nChef-owner John MacPherson during dinner service at Three Blacksmiths. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)\n\nConsider all of this a tease, by the way: The chef says he changes the menu \u201ca lot every week,\u201d completely every three weeks. If there\u2019s a thread from meal to meal, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s plates that encourage regular drop-ins.\n\nLocals might remember the location as Rae\u2019s Place, which was decorated with faux palm trees and bamboo. John MacPherson and Taylor replaced all that with quiet sophistication in the form of maple walls, tables from reclaimed barn wood and floors in a veneer of mahogany. Without a big budget, the owners managed to create a dreamy environment inspired by bits and pieces of their travels to London, Slovenia, Switzerland, France and Italy. The reference to three blacksmiths comes from a book Diane MacPherson read, \u201cBeyond the Rim: From Slavery to Redemption in Rappahannock\u201d by James D. Russell. In it, the author describes a long-ago Sperryville, bustling enough to employ a trio of blacksmiths.\n\n[Scenic Lupo Marino opens on uneven footing at the Wharf]\n\nLittle touches \u2014 pools of space between tables, sheepskin stools for purses, miniature anvils with your party\u2019s name written on it \u2014 make big impressions. Because you\u2019ve paid in advance for the pleasure, there\u2019s no bill. Some guests linger over the wine in their glass, or make friends of people who only hours ago had been strangers. Ultimately, Three Blacksmiths feels like the dinner party you don\u2019t want to leave. Regretfully, you do, with an apt treat of charcoal meringue in a small pouch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be good for you,\u201d Diane says. She\u2019s referencing the parting gift, but she might just as well be talking about Three Blacksmiths.", "description": "The tiny Sperryville destination has become the hardest reservation around, for good reason.", "authors": ["Tom Sietsema", "Food Critic", "September At Am", "Tom Sietsema Has Been The Washington Post'S Food Critic Since He Previously Worked For The Microsoft Corp.", "Where He Launched Sidewalk.Com", "The Seattle Post-Intelligencer", "The San Francisco Chronicle", "The Milwaukee Journal.
