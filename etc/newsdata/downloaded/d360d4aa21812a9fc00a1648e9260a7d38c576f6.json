Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) has seen little evidence that fellow presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) is prepared to be commander in chief, she said Thursday on Hill.TV's Rising.\n\n\"I haven't seen much come from her in the way of what kind of leadership and decision-making that she would bring to that most important responsibility of the president has as commander in chief,\" Gabbard told Rising host Krystal Ball. \"And just as a soldier and an American that's very concerning for me.\"\n\nBall asked Gabbard if she thought Warren was prepared to be commander in chief on Thursday, just two days after Gabbard qualified for the October Democratic debate.\n\nGabbard added voters will ask all the presidential candidates about their preparedness and experience when it comes to foreign policy. She questioned Warren's readiness to handle such issues given the former Harvard law professor's focus on domestic issues.\n\nShe added that the president should have \"the kind of foresight and judgment that we've seen leaders from across both party lines have lacked for far too long.\"\n\nGabbard, who serves in the Hawaii Army National Guard, made a similar argument against Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) during a July interview.\n\n\"I think one of the things I'm most concerned with is Kamala Harris is not qualified to serve as commander in chief, and I can say this from a personal perspective as a soldier. She's got no background or experience in foreign policy and she lacks the temperament that is necessary for a commander in chief,\" Gabbard said.\n\nGabbard's long-shot bid for the 2020 nomination took on renewed energy after she criticized Harris's record on criminal justice in a July debate. Poll numbers for Harris plummeted afterward in Iowa. Warren, meanwhile, has surged in the polls as a progressive alternative to frontrunner Joe Biden.\n\nGabbard failed to qualify for the party's September debate, but cleared the donor and polling thresholds for October after reaching 2 percent in a New Hampshire poll on Tuesday.", "description": "Rep.
