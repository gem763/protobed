It\u2019s promised $1 billion from its redoubtable coffers \u2014 which sounds generous until you realize it\u2019s companies like Facebook that are both feeding the problem and feeling its effects.\n\nAccording to Facebook CFO David Wehner, the company has committed to the amount, broken down into specific projects to improve the state. $150 million, for example, will go towards building affordable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area. It also wants to build \u201cessential worker housing,\u201d intended to \u201cfund construction of housing on county-owned land for teachers and other essential workers, enabling them to live near the communities where they work.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not precisely a secret that the average person can\u2019t afford to live anywhere near the major tech campuses. The last reported median home price in San Francisco is $1,466,900, and rents run into high four-figures. It\u2019s simply not feasible for anyone who\u2019s not making the big bucks. According to advocacy group Up for Growth, California is short 3.4 million housing units (nearly half of the nation\u2019s total shortage of 7.3 million).\n\nAnd the expense of the city may, in part, be contributing to the rise of homelessness. The homeless population in San Francisco is going up steadily \u2014 17 percent in the last two years. A report from the New York Times suggests residents\u2019 capacity for empathy is stretched to breaking point by the amount of inconvenience their homeless neighbors give them. Governor Gavin Newsom, who\u2019s partnering with Facebook on its initiative, said in a statement, \u201cState government cannot solve housing affordability alone \u2014 we need others to join Facebook in stepping up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as though Facebook gets nothing out of this, too \u2014 I\u2019m sure they could use the good karma now that a major election is drawing near. According to the Wall Street Journal, CEO Mark Zuckerberg also told employees earlier this month that the company\u2019s Menlo Park growth was stalling because workers can\u2019t afford to live close to the office: \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re growing primarily outside of the Bay Area. The housing prices are way up. The traffic is bad. There\u2019s a lot that we are trying to do to help build more housing and alleviate some of the traffic constraints, but for the near term it\u2019s going to be building up those other hubs.\u201d\n\nGoogle and Microsoft made similar pledges earlier this year. It remains to be seen how much these pledges will actually do to alleviate the problem \u2014 $1 billion sounds like a lot, but not when the amount of homes that need to be built with it number in the millions.\n\nFacebook Commits $1 Billion and Partners with the State of California to Address Housing Affordability on Facebook Newsroom\n\nRead next: Chrome and Firefox will now alert you about data breaches involving your accounts", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FZuck-Georgtown.jpg&signature=fe5cdf181993df623bde623a1a5ffb05", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
