That's why Slack today introduces Slack 101, a free online classroom to teach total newbies the basics of its app. It's designed to go beyond the tutorials that already exist in the app, and demonstrate \u2014 with visual walkthroughs, tips and, videos \u2014 how to get the most from the app.\n\n\"When we show that we're here and we got their backs and we're here to make them successful at work,\" Ali Rayl, vice president of customer experience at Slack, told Business Insider. \"Our customer's work is our work. Ultimately we're here to make them successful.\"\n\nRayl says that the ideal audience for Slack 101 are those for whom the concept is totally new. While many people come to Slack having used other, sometimes-similar chat apps, there are those for whom the concept of chatting at work is completely new. Slack 101 is designed to get them comfortable and productive with the app.\n\n\"What we're aiming for is a different audience - an audience that's like, I don't quite know what I'm doing. Can you take me through the arc of doing it properly?\" Rayl said.\n\n'Aha' moments\n\nOn Slack 101, users can also learn how to upload profile pictures, set notifications to fit their needs, use emoji reactions, work in channels\u2014 the basic chat rooms that form the core of how Slack works - and other common tasks.\n\nAn example of a lesson in Slack 101 Slack\n\nBefore launching Slack 101, Slack conducted research to find out what new users have trouble with.\n\nFor example, Rayl says Slack discovered that new users often don't realize they can download Slack as a desktop app. Instead, they end up having to dig through their email to find the URL of the Slack channel they're in, and open it in the browser.\n\n\"Channels are the foundational, most important piece of Slack,\" Rayl said. \"What is a channel, how do I work in it, how can I be confident that I'm using this right? This is something people are generally worried about at work.\"\n\nSomething else that surprises users is that they can edit messages within a few minutes after they're sent, Rayl says.\n\n\"It's not an affordance you find in other products,\" Rayl said. \"In SMS and Twitter, you can't edit what you sent. It's okay to make a mistake. You can just edit it. The freedom that it affords people makes people so much more comfortable.\"\n\nFrom user research, Rayl says the six most common \"aha\" moments for users are learning to use mentions, reminders, stars, pins, search, and file sharing.\n\nRead more: Slack stock is down 12% after its first earnings as a public company, in which it posted a big loss \u2014 including $8 million in credits to customers after outages\n\nWith Slack 101, Rayl says she hopes it will help users feel more confident while they're working.\n\n\"I want people to just be more successful with our product,\" Rayl said. \"The more people we can touch, the better as long as they succeed. This is my entire job. How can I make the most people the most successful at Slack? If they're successful, then they can be more successful at work.\"", "description": "From pinning messages to creating reminders, Slack 101 is an online course for users who are new to Slack.
