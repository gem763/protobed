REUTERS/Ammar Awad\n\nCustomer services staff at some of China\u2019s major couriers, including STO Express (002468.SZ), ZTO Express (ZTO.N) and YTO Express (600233.SS), told Reuters that such restrictions were put in place around August.\n\nOne staff member from STO said that single pieces of black clothing could be sent, but shipments of more than five pieces would be stopped. They were also not allowed to ship masks, bulk orders of umbrellas or sticks.\n\n\u201cAny items that can be used by mobs,\u201d he said.\n\nZTO and YTO declined to comment, while STO Express said that it abided by China\u2019s laws and regulations.\n\nChina\u2019s General Administration of Customs, which manages the country\u2019s imports and exports of goods, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBlack clothing and masks have been regularly worn by participants in the past four months of anti-government and anti-China protests in Hong Kong, which have seen police arrest more than 2,300 people since June. Thousands have been wounded, including two shot with live rounds.\n\nThe protesters are angry at what they see as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on Hong Kong, which was guaranteed 50 years of freedoms not extended to the mainland under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula when Britain returned the city to China in 1997.\n\nBeijing rejects the charge and accuses Western countries, especially the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble. The unrest poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. He has warned that any attempt to divide China would be crushed.\n\nThe shipping restrictions appear to be having little impact on the ground in Hong Kong, however, sales representatives at retailers such as Uniqlo, H&M and Giordano Ladies at a local mall told Reuters.\n\nMost said they had not heard of a ban on black clothing, and all said they had not received any corporate directives related to the ban, but also that they had not noticed an increase in the sale of black clothing recently.\n\nOne manager at H&M told said she was surprised to hear of such a restriction. \u201cWe can sell black clothing. We can also wear it,\u201d she said whilst sporting a black dress.", "description": "China has banned the bulk shipment of black clothing and other items popularly used by Hong Kong protesters to the city, staff at Chinese courier firms said, as authorities grapple with often violent anti-government protests that have gripped the city.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442259059&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H10G", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
