She died five days later in hospital.\n\n'The verdict proves that nobody will get away with murder in Bangladesh. We have the rule of law,' prosecutor Hafez Ahmed said following the verdict.\n\nHer death triggered outrage and also highlighted an alarming rise in sexual harassment cases in the South Asian country of 165 million people.\n\nRafi went to police back in March to make her complaint, where she was forced to recount events tearfully on camera in footage that was later leaked to local press. In the video, police can be heard dismissing her trauma as 'no big deal'\n\nProtesters hold placards and gather to demand justice for the 19-year-old woman who was killed after she was set on fire for refusing to drop sexual harassment charges against her Islamic school's principal, in Dhaka, Bangladesh\n\nProtesters in the capital Dhaka staged days of demonstrations seeking 'exemplary punishment' for the killers.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina had promised to prosecute all those involved.\n\nRafi had gone to police in late March to report the sexual harassment, and a leaked video shows the local police station chief registering her complaint but dismissing it as 'not a big deal'.\n\nPrincipal Siraj-ud-Daula has been arrested and accused of ordering the killing\n\nAt the time police had said that one of the 18 people initially arrested had accused the school's principal of ordering the attack.\n\nThe teacher 'told them to put pressure on Rafi to withdraw the case or kill her if she refused', senior police superintendent Mohammad Iqbal, who led the investigation, had told AFP.\n\nIqbal had also said that some of those arrested were Rafi's classmates and that they had tied her up with a scarf before setting her on fire.\n\n'The plan was to pass the incident off as a suicide. But it fell through after Rafi managed to come downstairs while on fire because the scarf burnt and freed her hands and feet,' he said.\n\nActivists say the murder exposed a culture of impunity surrounding sex crimes against women and children, and that fact that those who report harassment often suffer a backlash.\n\nProsecutions are also rare in cases of rape and sexual assault.\n\nAfter the murder, Bangladesh ordered some 27,000 schools to set up committees to prevent sexual violence.\n\nDefence lawyers said they would appeal against Thursday's verdict in the high court.\n\nThe case was fast-tracked with the hearing taking only 62 days.", "description": "Sixteen people including three teachers and two politicians have been sentenced to death for the murder of Nusrat Jahan Rafi, 19, who was burned to death in Bangladesh back in April.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/29/17/14108330-0-image-a-64_1559147010442.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
