The company is considering selling the asset as the country\u2019s proposed new mining taxes would make it challenging to generate adequate returns.\n\nGold production totalled 1.31 million ounces, lower than the second quarter\u2019s 1.35 million ounces, while copper output rose 14.4 per cent to 111 million pounds, the company said.\n\nAnalysts on average estimated gold production of 1.35 million ounces, and copper output of 105 million pounds, according to Refinitiv IBES data.\n\nBarrick said third-quarter gold cost of sales per ounce is expected to be about 11-13 per cent higher than the second quarter, primarily due to higher depreciation resulting from purchase price adjustments at Nevada Gold Mines.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "Lower output at its North Mara mine in Tanzania offset gains from its Randgold buy and the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/barrick.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
