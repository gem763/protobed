Frank Pallone saying that Republicans were \"trying to rally their base by fabricating a problem that simply does not exist.\"\n\nPallone also questioned whether the platform is taking the right measures to make sure that celebrities and politicians, like Trump, face the same rules as other individuals.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle pushed Dorsey on what he's doing to get rid of harassment online. \"I understand there are algorithms, I understand that there have to be checks and balances, but really it shouldn\u2019t take hours for something that's that egregious to come down,\" said Republican Rep.
