Democrats might argue that even if Trump were removed, Vice President Mike Pence would remain and, thus, there would be a continuum.\n\nCNN LAUGHS OFF TRUMP\u2019S CLAIM THAT BOSS JEFF ZUCKER COULD WALK AWAY FROM NETWORK\n\nBut does anyone believe Democrats would be satisfied with that? The Post recently published a kooky article laying out how it could also take down Pence and make House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., president.\n\nPelosi placed House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff in charge of this impeachment attempt, and the whole thing is getting stranger and more secretive by the hour.\n\nFirst we were told that an allegedly patriotic whistleblower must testify to underline how Trump committed some kind of impeachable high crime on a phone call with the president of Ukraine. This whistleblower wasn't even present at the scene of the supposed crime.\n\nThere's an obvious reason why this alleged hero's identity has been obscured. It was reported that he worked with Joe Biden in the White House on Ukraine issues. A story worth explaining? The whole scheme began to look like a Democratic plot. And suddenly, the incessant pro-impeachment media went dark on their central figure.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s testimony was no longer the piece de Resistance. Pardon the pun.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSusan Ferrechio at the Washington Examiner noted that Republicans planned to ask this whistleblower all kinds of questions about when he met with Schiff's staff and how they coordinated. \"But it is appearing more likely Republicans will never have the chance to ask the whistleblower any questions at all about how closely he worked with Schiff's team,\" she said.\n\nEven some of the liberal \"fact-checkers\" felt pressed to admit Schiff lied when he claimed on national TV that he and his staff never met with this whistleblower. Clearly, he doesn't want any more questions about how coordinated this impeachment plot is.\n\nA GOP source told the Examiner: \"At some point, both Schiff and the whistleblower came to the conclusion that his personal testimony stands to do more harm than good to both of them.\"\n\nThe backpedaling has been furious. Schiff appeared on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" and said that \"given that we already have the call record, we don't need the whistleblower who wasn't on the call to tell us what took place during the call.\"\n\nBoth Schiff and Margaret Brennan of CBS agreed the most important priority of this probe is keeping the identity of the whistleblower a secret \u2013 without questioning for a moment how that could be considered fair to the president, who's the subject of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nImagine the Republicans had tried to impeach then-President Bill Clinton in 1998 for some phone call he made to a foreign leader, and that they'd said they had an anonymous whistleblower who never heard Clinton's phone call. The press would have mocked all of it as an enormous waste of time and money and a huge distraction from the legislative \"business of the people.\"\n\nThe media\u2019s completely different and partisan reaction to this only underlines how much collusion goes on between the journalists and the Democrats. They're hard to distinguish from one another. They use all the same talking points and catchphrases. They've had a shared goal of impeaching Trump since the day he was inaugurated. There is no balance or fairness in anything the media \"reports\" on this brazen attempt to overthrow this administration.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY L.
