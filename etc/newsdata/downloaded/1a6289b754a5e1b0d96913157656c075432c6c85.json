Emotionally they were spent and I think that's a great sign for rugby in Japan.\n\n\"People in Japan respect that they gave everything they had ... and they are a huge success story of the tournament.\"\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has fired a shot at the Six Nations countries to abandon their self interest and try to work with World Rugby to get a global calendar.
