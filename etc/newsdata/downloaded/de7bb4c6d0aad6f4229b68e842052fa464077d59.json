But it wants to create a buffer zone on hundreds more, stretching from the Euphrates River in the west to the Iraqi border in the east.\n\nThe deal struck by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Erdogan -- under which American troops would guide a YPG exit -- was vague on detail. But Turkey has made its interpretation clear.\n\nTurkish officials including Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu were quick to boast that they had been given pretty much all they desired.\n\nWith the ink on the agreement barely dry, Erdogan made it clear that the Kurds must leave a zone 444 km long and as deep as 32 km.\n\n\u201cIf their promise is not kept the minute when the 120th hour ends, then our operation will continue with even more determination from where it was left off,\u201d Erdogan said in Istanbul on Friday.\n\nTurkey, U.S. Agree to Brief Cease-Fire to Allow Kurdish Retreat\n\nBut the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, General Mazloum Abdi, sees it differently. He said Thursday night the cease-fire deal was limited to the 120-km stretch between Tal Abyad and Ras Al-Ayn.\n\nJim Jeffrey, the U.S. special envoy for the Syria conflict who was with Pence in Ankara, highlighted the potential obstacle to a lasting deal.\n\n\u201cThe Turks talk about an aspirational safe zone,\u201d he said, while the U.S. has only defined a central section of the northeast corridor, where Turkish forces have penetrated as deep as 30 kilometers. With Kurdish-led forces vowing not to accept a \u201cTurkish occupation of Syrian territory,\u201d the fighting might not be over yet.\n\nAmid differing views on the zone, there were reports of sporadic clashes, airstrikes and Turkish shelling in the area, resulting in the death of 14 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group.\n\nMost of the fighting in northeast Syria has stopped, a U.S. official said, asking not to be identified. It will take time for things to completely quiet down, which is usually the case in situations like this, the official said.\n\n(Updates on casualties, U.S. official view on truce.)\n\n--With assistance from Justin Sink.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Selcan Hacaoglu in Ankara at shacaoglu@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Onur Ant at oant@bloomberg.net;Lin Noueihed at lnoueihed@bloomberg.net;Kevin Whitelaw at kwhitelaw@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Kurdish fighters say they have no intention of withdrawing from Syria\u2019s entire northeastern border -- but that\u2019s exactly what Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expects to happen under the cease-fire accord brokered by the U.S. on Thursday.The conflicting interpretations point to the", "authors": ["Selcan Hacaoglu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GEhaaVu0AVOGfLt34Teezg--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/6000d04c6bbe194a459a426f8c6284f5", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
