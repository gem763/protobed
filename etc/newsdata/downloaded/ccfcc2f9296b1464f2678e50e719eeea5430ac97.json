It is an ancient evolutionary response that helped our ancestors to be alert at times of danger.\n\n'These days, thankfully, we\u2019re less likely to be in physical danger, but our bodies still respond to stress by keeping us awake. The stress hormone, cortisol, keeps us alert - and with that alertness we often experience a busy-ness of mind that attaches to whatever is going on for us: whether that\u2019s worry about work, or our kids, or the future.\n\n'Stress makes it harder for us to get to sleep and stay asleep, because sustained hyperarousal during the day \u2014 an overly active mind \u2014 is one of the main predictors of experiencing difficulty falling asleep.\n\n'Developing a meditation practice has been shown to reduce stress, pretty significantly, and that can often get to the root of a lot of sleep problems.\n\n'It\u2019s not always what we do at night that is important (or though it can make a big difference). Our attitude to life during the day can have a knock on effect on our sleep.'\n\nAndy Puddicombe (pictured) co-founder of meditation app Headspace, reveals that stress could be one of the things that is effecting our sleep - as the stress hormone, cortisol, keeps us alert\n\nOver stimulated mind\n\nIf we've got a lot going on in our heads or we've been glued to our phones, especially during the evening, our mind will be over stimulated.\n\n'We can\u2019t really be stimulating the mind late at night \u2014 running around doing last minute chores, scrolling social media, answering emails \u2014 and then expect to nod off as soon as our head hits the pillow,' Andy says.\n\n'I\u2019d encourage cutting down screen-time and to steer clear of caffeine or alcohol in the evening.\n\n'People often wonder why they experience more anxious thoughts once in bed, as if the mind\u2019s floodgates open as soon as we close our eyes.\n\n'The reality is that we\u2019re so busy throughout the day that these thoughts haven\u2019t had the chance to arise, so, once we\u2019re lying down and doing nothing, we get to experience everything that\u2019s been suppressed.\n\n'Meditation teaches us how to put distance between ourselves and those thoughts/feelings, allowing the spaciousness of mind for good, quality sleep.'\n\nTense muscles\n\nNo one tends to fall asleep when they're were tense,so how can we relax more before bed?\n\n'A warm bath or shower 30 minutes or so before bed has been shown to relax body and mind, and it\u2019s worth cultivating an environment conducive for sleep \u2014 a cool-not-too-warm, uncluttered room with dimmed lighting,' admits Andy.\n\nNo one ever feel asleep when they were tense, only a relaxed body and mind will help you gently nod off. Andy recommends cutting down on screen time and even having a warm bath to relax your body (stock picture)\n\n'Healthy sleep has more to do with quality of rest than quantity of hours, and quality of rest has a lot to do with our quality of mind. So it\u2019s more about how we approach sleep.\n\n'It\u2019s best to have no fixed ideas that say \u201cThis is how many hours I need tonight\u201d \u2014 that pressure often adds to the stress around getting to sleep. If we don\u2019t \u201ctry\u201d to sleep, it simply happens just like breathing.\n\n'Reading a book or journal-ling is another good way to unwind and bring us into the present moment. Obviously, Sleep by Headspace \u2014 in the app, offers a bunch of content designed to help you drift off and stay asleep, so that\u2019s a useful tool to help us disengage from a hectic day and unplug.'\n\nA mindful sleep\n\n'I know some people who sleep way longer than 8 or 10 hours, and they still wake up feeling exhausted, which shows that quality sleep has little to do with duration and more to do with what the mind is doing when we\u2019re sleeping.\n\n'A restful mind often results in restful sleep. So I\u2019d recommend a short 10 minute meditation before bed, to give the mind the opportunity to settle down. In addition, and this might sound surprising, having a consistent wake up time is the single best thing you can do for your sleep.\n\n'That\u2019s because your circadian rhythm, AKA your body clock, is actually set by your wake up time, rather than your bedtime. So if you sleep late over the weekend, and wake up early on Monday, then your body\u2019s circadian rhythm will be slightly out of sync - effectively you will have given yourself jetlag.\n\n'There are other causes of chronic daytime tiredness, like sleep apnea, so, of course, if you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s worth getting a referral to a sleep specialist from you GP.\n\nMeditation exercise to help you get BACK to sleep If you wake up in the middle of the night, or too early for your liking in the morning, Andy shares a simple exercise to help you get back to sleep... Eyes closed, take a couple of deep breaths, and, starting at the number 1,000, just slowly and gently count backwards...to zero (you won\u2019t get there).\n\nFocus on the counting, rather than trying to will yourself to sleep.\n\nFailing that, and because mindfulness helps us to be more aware of how we\u2019re feeling, it\u2019s worth checking in with the body to see if we\u2019re feeling genuinely sleepy.\n\nIf the body and mind are feeling energetic, then often the best thing to do is to get out of bed. It might sound a bit counterintuitive, but, that way, we\u2019re not creating a negative association with our bed.\n\nIf you do get up, it\u2019s best to engage in some kind of relaxing activity that isn\u2019t too stimulating.\n\nReading is great, or doing some cleaning (we even have a guided meditation for that).\n\nContinue to check in with the body and mind, and once you\u2019re truly sleepy, get back into bed. Bonus: Even if you can\u2019t sleep, you\u2019ve done the ironing\n\nPrep for sleep in the day\n\nMany of us think about sleep only when we are trying to drift off, but Andy says we should be more mindful of sleep throughout the day too.\n\n'The more distracted, busy, and stimulated we are throughout the day, the more sleep we\u2019re going to need. Conversely, the less distracted, busy, and stimulated we are, the less sleep we\u2019re going to need.\n\n'So our approach to sleep begins in the daytime, especially around how we think about sleep. If we tell ourselves \u201cI\u2019m a terrible sleeper\u201d or \u201cI always struggle to sleep\u201d, we are programming the mind to think only that way. If we can change that kind of internal dialogue, we can change how we sleep.\n\n'Training the mind \u2014 through meditation \u2014 facilities better quality sleep because we learn to become calmer, clearer, and less overwhelmed. Living more mindfully means having the ability to be more present and less distracted, so that involves things like using our devices more selectively (especially evenings), and being aware when we are caught up in all-consuming thoughts and storylines.\n\n'Mindfulness allows us to step back and observe our mind\u2019s behaviour a little more clearly, without getting caught up in every little thought and feeling that arises, which is what keeps us awake.\n\n'It also helps us to accept whatever each night brings us. Instead of reacting to not sleeping, and getting exasperated, we train ourselves to stay present without getting entangled in frustration, or worries about how the next day will turn out.\n\nHow to start meditating\n\nIf you've never tried it before Andy talks us through how to start.\n\n'Whether you use the Headspace app or not all you have to do to start meditating is find a quiet place to sit by yourself (on a chair, a cushion, or the floor), close the eyes, and focus on the normal rhythm of your breath. In through the nose; out through the mouth.\n\n'It\u2019s normal when we first start out for the mind to jump around and get easily distracted by thoughts, feelings, or sounds. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s one of the myths around meditation that we are trying to \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cempty\u201d the mind.\n\n'We can\u2019t \u2014 the mind\u2019s nature is to think, so it\u2019s going to think. But each time the thinking mind kicks in, all we have to do is focus on the breath. Noticing the distraction is awareness itself.\n\n'The more we practice coming back to the breath, the more stable our awareness becomes, and the more comfortable the mind is with sitting still and being present.\n\n'It\u2019s worth starting to meditate for five minutes, then ten minutes, building up the practice. Over time, the benefits of training the mind \u2014 to be less active and less reactive \u2014 will spill over into everyday life.'", "description": "Andy Puddicombe, co-founder of meditation app Headspace, reveals that stress could be one of the things that is effecting our sleep - as the stress hormone, cortisol, keeps us alert.", "authors": ["Sarah Finley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/13/19989456-0-image-a-25_1571659944117.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
