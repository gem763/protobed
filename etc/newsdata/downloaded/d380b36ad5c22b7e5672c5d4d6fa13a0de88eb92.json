Toshi Tsutsumi, 60, and his wife Masako, 62, along with friends and police officers handed out leaflets with drawings of the suspect\u2019s face and clothes on Friday to commuters and passersby outside Tanigami Station on Hokushinkyuko line.\n\nOn Oct 4, 2010, in Kobe\u2019s Kita Ward, Shota Tsutsumi was standing near a vending machine, drinking with a third grade junior high school girl at around 10:40 p.m. when a man sitting on the other side of the road approached the pair. Tsutsumi told the girl to run.\n\nTsutsumi was later found at a crossing 70 meters away by a passerby who called 119. He had sustained an 8-cm cut to his neck and died from loss of blood. A knife used to stab Tsutsumi was found in a drainage ditch near the scene of the crime and DNA tests revealed that blood found on the knife was that of the victim.\n\nTsutsumi\u2019s female companion told police she did not know the attacker.\n\nThe victim\u2019s father said he has not given up hope that his son\u2019s killer will be arrested and said he believes that someone must know who the suspect is.\n\nThere is a 3 million yen reward for anyone who provides information leading to the arrest of the killer.
