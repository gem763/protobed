Short answer: A lot of free nights. Here are five amazing hotels you can book with the IHG Rewards Club Premier Card's sign-up bonus.\n\nRead more: The best hotel credit cards in 2019\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nIHG Rewards Club Premier card details\n\nThe IHG Rewards Club Premier card offers tremendous value in exchange for reasonable annual fee ($89) and the ability to earn free nights faster. Cardholders receive an annual free night when they renew the card, plus accelerated earnings. The card offers 4 points per dollar spent on everything during the first 12 months. After that, the card will continue to earn 2 points at gas stations, grocery store and restaurants. All other purchases earn 1 point per dollar spent.\n\nYou'll also earn 25 points per dollar spent on IHG hotels in the first 12 months, then 10 points after. Additionally, you'll earn 15 points per dollar as a Platinum member (courtesy of the IHG credit card) of the IHG Rewards Club program. So you can really rake in a lot of points toward future award stays.\n\nInterContinental Le Moana Bora Bora (70,000 points per night)\n\nThe InterContinental Le Moana Bora Bora is one of the most luxurious resorts in the IHG portfolio. Even standard rooms at this resort are above the norm. For 70,000 points per night, you can book a beach bungalow overlooking a gorgeous lagoon. Relax on your own private 560-square-foot terrace and rinse off in the outdoor shower after a swim.\n\nThis room accommodates two adults and two children with a pull-out sofa and plenty of space for the family. Award space at this hotel can be sparse, but it's a great value when you can nab it. With 125,000 points from the IHG Rewards Club Premier card, you have about 90% of the points needed for two free nights.\n\nInterContinental Resort Mauritius (30,000 points per night)\n\nSet in the midst of a lush landscape facing Balaclava Bay, the InterContinental in Mauritius is a great place to redeem your IHG points, and it's pretty reasonable, too. For just 30,000 points per night, you can book a 6000-square-foot oceanfront room with a private balcony.\n\nWith the sign-up bonus from the IHG Premier card, you can cover up to five free nights at this resort. If you're doing the math and wondering how 125,000 points equals five nights at this resort, it's all thanks to a special credit card perk: Cardholders get the fourth award night free.\n\nInterContinental Paris Le Grand (70,000 points)\n\nOpened in 1862, this iconic hotel has hosted celebrities and royals alike. For 70,000 points per night, you can book a renovated Classic room. The hotel is just steps from the Paris Opera and perfect for sightseeing.\n\nRead more: IHG Rewards Club Premier card review\n\nInterContinental Singapore (50,000 points)\n\nSingapore is foodie heaven, and the InterContinental Singapore is the perfect place from which to explore all the city has to offer.

Of course, two nights in Singapore isn't enough, but you could save up your points and combine them with the card's annual free night award for a longer stay.\n\nInterContinental Chennai Mahabalipuram Resort (25,000 points)\n\nIf you're looking for a relaxing resort that provides a great base to explore Chennai's UNESCO World Heritage Site, look no further than the Intercontinental Chennai Mahabalipuram Resort.

Every month, IHG offers up a new batch of hotels that can be booked for as little as 5,000 points per night. In the past, this has included high-end resorts like the Intercontinental Tahiti, though it's usually light on premium hotels and heavier on Holiday Inns.\n\nThe 125,000 point sign-up bonus could be redeemed for up to 25 nights through the PointBreaks program.", "description": "The IHG Club Premier card is currently offering a sign-up bonus of 125,000 points.
