We\u2019ll always be brothers.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"We\u2019re certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and as I know he\u2019ll always be there for me.\n\n\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t see each other as much as we, as much as we used to because we\u2019re so busy.\n\n\"But, I love him dearly and, you know, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing.\n\n\"Just as I said, as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.\u201d\n\nHere, Judi gives he opinion on Harry's body language when discussing the rift with brother William:\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nIt was clear throughout this tour that Harry and Meghan appear to be a tighter family unit than ever, with baby Archie at their core. When Meghan spoke eloquently to camera we then saw Harry waiting patiently to one side, cradling his son in his arms for Meghan to bend over to kiss and stroke as soon as she was finished.\n\nTheir delight in their son and in one another was obvious as we saw them walk away with Harry beaming and Meghan stroking Harry\u2019s back in a mutually-protective-looking gesture of love.\n\nIt was when Harry was alone in Botswana that we saw clues of building emotions as he became the grieving son walking in the footsteps of his mother.\n\nHis splayed hand banging against his chest as he spoke about the environment suggested passion for his causes but when he answered questions about more personal issues we saw a different range of emotions.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHis laugh when asked about the rumoured rift with his brother William looked rueful and he paused to compose his words. His grin looked almost like a reflection of what he thought William\u2019s response would be if he were asked the same question and he shoved his hands into his pockets as he told Tom \u2018I love him dearly\u2019 but that they have good days and bad days as brothers.\n\nIt was clear from his grin that humour is still the tie that binds between them, plus the kind of unconditional love that he described even though they might have \u2018different paths at the moment\u2019.\n\nThe long \u2018Um\u2019 when Harry is asked about William and the way he gazes off to the right suggests he is measuring his words as his body rocks slightly, but the fact that his more spontaneous reaction is a smile as he is thinking of William suggests the links of humour and affection are still there between the brothers despite what he describes as \u2018good days and bad days as brothers\u2019.\n\nHe performs a one-shoulder shrug to brush off any suggestion of a real problem and his direct eye contact when he tells Tom \u2018I will always be there for him\u2019 etc suggests these are authentic sentiments.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Body language expert Judi James believes Prince Harry was being authentic when he brushed off any suggestion of a real problem between the brothers", "authors": ["Judi James", "Image", "Itv", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662631.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_201019Slug_2517JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
