In a bad way, actually,\u2019 he said on Jessie Ware\u2019s Table Manners podcast.\n\n\u2018And it was neither of our faults because we have both been through so many circumstances but all of that stuff puts so much pressure on a relationship.\n\n\u2018Say going out for a dinner or whatever it is, whereas now my whole new thing is that I don\u2019t give a s**t, it\u2019s not worth sacrificing my happiness and it\u2019s been far too long of different relationships that that\u2019s come between me [and them].\u2019\n\nThe pair share two-year-old baby son Bear (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe couple made a rare public appearance at February 2018\u2019s Brit Awards red carpet, but announced they were parting ways just five months later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018But that\u2019s a lot of pressure on whoever you\u2019re with, and I mean Cheryl\u2019s had that pressure for life.\n\n\u2018So for her, if you were going out somewhere, it would take so long to get out of the door because you\u2019re just so worried about what that shot\u2019s going to look like.\n\n\u2018Whereas now I\u2019m just like \u201cf**k it\u201d, just go out and have some fun.\u2019\n\n\u2018You\u2019re just so worried about what that shot\u2019s going to look like,\u2019 he said (Picture: Getty)\n\nLiam has since moved on from his relationship with the X Factor judge with Maya, and they couldn\u2019t appear any happier.\n\nHe recently gushed over his other half on Instagram, telling his followers: \u2018Sometimes I don\u2019t recognise this happy guy\u2026 sure glad you brought him back though.\u2019\n\nDuring an appearance on KISS Breakfast, he said: \u2018[Maya\u2019s] awesome \u2026 it\u2019s kind of got to the point with my life, where I\u2019m like, screw this. It\u2019s not worth my happiness. If someone is going to take a picture, someone is going to do something.\n\n\u2018The difference is with [Maya], she\u2019s so relaxed that it helps me relax in a situation. It\u2019s been quite nice just going out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve managed to explore a lot more of London than I ever have actually my life, which has been quite fun.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted reps for Cheryl for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
