At the group\u2019s headquarters in Woolloongabba, a busy training schedule is under way. It is hosting introductory sessions at local libraries planning two large-scale marches, with a litany of other \u201cnon-violent disruptive actions\u201d.\n\nSince the group conducted its first action in Australia in April, there have been more than 170 arrests, with penalties ranging from a warning to a $1,500 fine.\n\nWhen new laws designed to target the tactics used by Extinction Rebellion pass parliament, those penalties will escalate. The use of a purpose-designed \u201cdangerous attachment device to disrupt lawful activities\u201d, referring to the Extinction Rebellion tactic of locking on to railways and roads, will attract a $6,500 fine or two years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nNSW farm trespass bill criticised for turning into a crackdown on the right to protest Read more\n\nPeaceful protest, the Queensland government says, is only acceptable if it does not disrupt people going about their ordinary business.\n\nBut disruption is the point.\n\n\u201cWe are using civil disobedience to cause economic disruption and a disruption to business as usual,\u201d Extinction Rebellion south-east Queensland member Emma Dorge says. \u201cWithout disruption, our voices are not being heard.\u201d\n\nShe is not deterred by harsher penalties.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting against extinction,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are doing what\u2019s necessary in the face of complete inaction from governments on climate change.\u201d\n\nQueensland has proposed two new amendments this year designed to clamp down on protests: increased trespass penalties aimed at animal welfare protests, currently going through a parliamentary committee, and the lock-on laws. It has also introduced biosecurity regulations with on-the-spot fines for entering an agricultural premises.\n\nNew South Wales has also introduced new $1,000 on-the-spot penalties through biosecurity regulations and is considering draft laws with broad new trespass penalties.\n\nWhen the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, was opposition leader in 2016, he ceremonially ripped up anti-protest laws proposed by his predecessor, but his government has also said it will increase penalties for trespass. The reforms are aimed at animal welfare protesters described by the attorney general as \u201cmushy-headed vegans\u201d.\n\nWithout disruption, our voices are not being heard. Emma Dorge, Extinction Rebellion\n\nVictoria is holding a parliamentary inquiry to determine if it ought to strengthen trespass laws, following uproar about a $1 fine levied against an activist who stole a goat from a Gippsland cheese cafe. The Law Institute of Victoria has suggested the government instead introduce laws promoting greater transparency in the agriculture industry.\n\nTasmania, still bruised from a 2017 high court decision that struck down its anti-protest laws, is working on amended legislation to reintroduce the laws.\n\nThat high court ruling \u2013 that environmental protests are political and protected under the constitutional implied freedom of political communication \u2013 could potentially apply to Queensland and NSW laws as proposed.\n\n\u201cWhen we see the positioning that\u2019s been coming out of the government we tend to look at it through two filters,\u201d the Wilderness Society national director, Lyndon Schneiders, says. \u201cOne is: is what they are proposing actually legal? And secondly, what are they trying to achieve politically?\u201d\n\nThe NSW Nature Conservation Council chief executive, Chris Gambian, says the NSW legislation is framed as a narrow provision supporting farmers but could actually work against their interests by penalising almost all protest actions.\n\nFarmers have been heavily involved in environmental protests in Australia, particularly against coal seam gas. The Bentley Blockade, a seven-year protest in the Northern Rivers region which successfully halted gas exploration and is cited as inspiration by Dorge and other Extinction Rebellion members as an example of successful activism, was underpinned by farmers.\n\nAnd when more than 300,000 people join climate strikes around Australia, can protesting still be considered a fringe activity?\n\n\u201cThere is a culture war going on that is trying to pit those people that care about the environment against other people, and I think that\u2019s incredibly worrying,\u201d Gambian says.\n\nTake these comments from Peter Dutton.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, says disruptive protesters deserve to be shamed. Photograph: Glenn Hunt/AAP\n\n\u201cPeople should take these names, and the photos of these people, and distribute them as far and wide as we can so that we shame these people,\u201d said the home affairs minister in his regular spot on Sydney\u2019s 2GB radio. \u201cLet their families know what you think of their behaviour \u2026 We should push back on it because these people are a scourge, they are doing the wrong thing. If you want to protest, do it peacefully.\u201d\n\nIn this context, \u201cpeaceful\u201d can be taken to mean \u201cunobtrusive\u201d.\n\nDutton also suggested protesters should face mandatory minimum sentences and murmured support for host Ray Hadley\u2019s suggestion that the welfare payments of protesters be restricted. In the world of talkback radio, the Venn diagram of ordinary working Australians and people who protest are two circles that never meet. Reality has more overlap.\n\nGambian is a spokesperson for a loose coalition of environment groups, Unions NSW and legal groups that have banded together to oppose the proposed NSW anti-protest laws, which would result in protesters facing fines of up to $22,000.\n\nA similar coalition of 80 organisations, from unions to religious groups, staved off the most recent anti-protest laws in WA and is waiting to see the draft of the new proposed laws.\n\n\u201cIt was a matter that brought together a really broad cross-section of society,\u201d Perth-based public advocacy lawyer Kate Davis says. \u201cI don\u2019t think any laws that are targeted at restricting the right to protest have a place in our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nothing has changed\u2019: why Queensland\u2019s protest battle has raised Joh Bjelke-Petersen's ghost Read more\n\nThe proposed NSW laws, like new federal laws passed in August, are targeted at \u201cfarm invasion\u201d protests from animal activists who have targeted abattoirs, factory farming operations and family-run farms in the past 18-months.\n\nThey make use of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act and are \u201cbreathtakingly broad,\u201d says Gambian, and would capture protests on environmental grounds, including anti-mining protests.\n\nThat act was amended in 2016 to introduce a $5,500 penalty for aggravated unlawful entry to enclosed lands. It was up for review next month, but that review has now been superseded by the proposed Right to Farm Bill.\n\nThe proposed amendments would increase the penalty for aggravated trespass to $13,200 or 12 months\u2019 jail. If a person was accompanied by two or more other people, or taken to be interfering with the conduct of the business, they would face a $22,000 fine or three years\u2019 jail.\n\n\u201cEnclosed land is any land that has a fence around it,\u201d Gambian says. \u201cIncluding a temporary fence. Including a temporary fence erected while the protest is going on.\u201d\n\nIt includes public land, such as state parliament.\n\nEmily Howie, legal director for the Human Rights Law Centre, says the proposed laws could run afoul of the same constitutional provisions that allowed the former Greens leader Bob Brown to win his high court challenge against the Tasmanian anti-protest laws.\n\nIf the laws were found to be denying Australians their constitutional freedom to talk about things that are politically important, Howie says, they could be found to be invalid.\n\nMoves by governments to protect businesses from disruption are legitimate, Howie says, but they must be \u201creasonable and proportionate\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe last thing that we want is for laws that are meant to be protecting business to in fact be deterring people from engaging in peaceful and lawful protest and our concern about this bill in New South Wales is that is exactly what it does,\u201d she says.\n\n", "description": "Peter Dutton has described protesters as \u2018a scourge\u2019 with the threat of increased penalties and imprisonment in several states", "authors": ["Calla Wahlquist"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88118ff806f88d738b33a001205dd92fd056701c/0_255_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3a59fc22fa65136c1a15402d92481f9f", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
