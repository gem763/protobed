It can take ten years for the average first homebuyer to save a 20 per cent deposit.\u201d\n\nThe scheme is open to eligible applicants who have taxable incomes up to $125,000 a year for singles and up to $200,000 a year for couples.\n\n\u201cThe Scheme will apply to owner-occupied loans on a principal and interest basis, and will be subject to regional price caps.\u201d\n\nAs well as helping put FHBs into housing faster, the legislation created a new research body to \u201cexamine housing demand, supply and affordability in Australia\u201d.\n\nThe race to beat affordability concerns amid record prices rises in recent years has also seen the Federal Government create the First Home Super Saver Scheme where Aussies voluntarily boost their super contributions \u2014 taxed at lower levels \u2014 to allow them to build a deposit for a first him.\n\nOther measures in place include the allocation of $1 billion to the National Housing Infrastructure Facility \u201cto unlock new housing supply, in partnership with local councils\u201d and the release of Commonwealth land, including defence land, for housing development.\n\n\u201cThese incentives have helped thousands of first home buyers enter the market. In the past year, more than 110,000 Australians bought their first home \u2014 the highest level since 2009.\u201d the statement said.\n\nFOLLOW SOPHIE FOSTER ON FACEBOOK", "description": "A controversial scheme for the Federal Government go halfsies with 10,000 first home buyers on mortgage deposits has been given the green light.", "authors": ["Sophie Foster"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15181630/capi_5d06653a89bfd1a5b909f8dc007f88ee_d7bd68a18d24ef2a6d6d6671b0e825d1.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
