Since there is no cure for MBC, only ways to manage it, she\u2019ll be in treatment for as long as she\u2019s alive.\n\nIt\u2019s just one of the many ways that Walker and the estimated 155,000 women (and men) living with metastatic breast cancer in the U.S. can feel erased from the larger breast cancer narrative \u2014 something that\u2019s especially true in October, which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, when such positive, pink-ribbon stories of survivorship are everywhere, and mention of metastatic breast cancer is as rare as always.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re their worst nightmare,\u201d Stephanie Seban, 40, an influencer and self-dubbed \u201cstage-4 thriver,\u201d tells Yahoo Lifestyle about how women with early-stage breast cancer tend to view those who are metastatic. \u201cThere is such a divide in the breast cancer world.\u201d But Seban has made it her mission to give voice to the reality of MBC.\n\n\u201cPeople want to hear about success stories, survival stories,\u201d Katherine O\u2019Brien, 53, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. She\u2019s an advocate with the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network, founded for support and education in 2004, after a small group of women with MBC were asked to leave a general breast cancer conference. She\u2019s been living with \u201cmets,\u201d as many call it, since 2009. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear about \u2018well, yes, I\u2019m still alive, but each successive treatment brings its own challenges\u2026\u2019 That\u2019s not exactly a joyful story.\u201d\n\nBut not telling it has its own risks. \u201cThe danger there is that when nobody hears about metastatic disease [and has it], they think they\u2019re the only ones,\u201d says CJ (Dian) Corneliussen, who founded METAavivor, a research and support nonprofit. \u201cAnd that\u2019s true isolation.\u201d As Walker adds, \u201cKnowledge is power. You have to advocate for yourself.\u201d\n\nIn honor of National Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day, on Oct. 13, Yahoo Lifestyle is shining a spotlight on some of the realities of living with metastatic breast cancer \u2014 by hearing from women who have experienced isolation because of it, and have been actively engaged in trying to change that, for everyone.\n\nKatherine O\u2019Brien, 53, is an advocate with the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network , founded for support and education in 2004.

Komen, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cBecause the worst thing we can do is sweep metastatic breast cancer under the rug and pretend it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly is metastatic breast cancer?\n\nMBC is breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast to other parts of the body, such as the bones, lungs, liver or brain. It\u2019s the most advanced stage of breast cancer, also called stage-4, and is not curable, only treatable \u2014 through hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or other drugs, all of which focus on length and quality of life.\n\nWhen someone has breast cancer that remains in the breast, it can be treated, and, in the majority of cases, never reappear. But an estimated 20 to 30 percent of people initially diagnosed with early-stage disease will see the cancer recur, or become metastasized, sometimes up to 15 years later; only about five percent of people with MBC will be metastatic at initial diagnosis.\n\nWhile being diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer is not an instant death sentence, most will ultimately die of the disease; it accounts for approximately 40,000 deaths a year in the U.S. It can affect men and women, both old and young.", "description": "Many of the estimated 155,000 women (and men) living with metastatic breast cancer in the U.S. can feel erased from the larger breast cancer narrative, which is largely focused on survival.", "authors": ["Beth Greenfield", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tRFvbfLXR1x.YTyOsK9Yjg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/3b0171d0-eb8c-11e9-be5f-0d7e779a8630", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
