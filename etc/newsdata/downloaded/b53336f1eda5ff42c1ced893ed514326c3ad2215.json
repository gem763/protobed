But just one hour before opening statements were set to begin, a settlement was announced.\n\nA federal judge combined more than 2,500 claims from courts across the country. Summit and Cuyahoga counties were set to go first as a test of how the plaintiff arguments will fare, but Judge Dan Polster, a Clinton appointee, had been urging all parties to settle for months.\n\nAttorneys said last-ditch efforts at reaching a global settlement collapsed late Friday, and the focus switched over the weekend to just Cuyahoga and Summit counties.\n\nThe details: According to plaintiffs' attorneys, the \"Big Three\" distributors McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc., AmerisourceBergen Corp., will pay a combined $215 million immediately. Manufacturer Teva Pharmaceutical Industries will pay $20 million cash between the end of this year and 2021 and provide $25 million worth of the anti-overdose drug Suboxone.\n\nMore litigation likely: The counties said they are still prepared to go forward with a lawsuit against pharmacy chain Walgreens, which is being sued for its role as both a distributor and pharmacy and hinted that further litigation against pharmacies is on the table. The Walgreens trial was separated from the others that settled Monday and has been postponed.\n\nWhat's next: Legal experts think the settlement buys time for the companies to settle the other lawsuits brought by municipalities. There are also incentives for states too.\n\nRead more on the settlement here.\n\nFour states announce $48 billion settlement framework in opioid lawsuits\n\nJust hours after announcing a settlement with two Ohio counties, almost all the same companies announced a framework for a $48 billion settlement with four state attorneys general.\n\nThe settlement, which would involve Cardinal Health, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, Johnson & Johnson and Teva, would include $22 billion in cash and $26 billion worth of a generic opioid addiction treatment, product distribution and data tracking measures.\n\nThe framework is an \"agreement in principle\" and has not been finalized. The attorneys general said they hoped other states would sign on.\n\n\"The opioid epidemic has ripped through our communities and left a trail of death and destruction in its wake,\" said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein (D).\n\nThe details:\n\nEach state and its local governments will receive a share of the $22 billion in cash to provide addiction treatment, paramedic services and telehealth treatment.\n\nMcKesson, a drug distribution company, would pay $6.68 billion over 18 years, the highest amount of all the companies in the settlement.\n\nCardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen, also drug distributors, would pay about $5.6 billion each over 18 years.\n\nJohnson & Johnson, a drug manufacturer, would pay $4 billion over two to three years, while Teva would pay $250 million over 10 years.\n\nTeva would also supply $23 billion of its generic suboxone product over 10 years.\n\nRead more here.\n\nPrivate equity-funded doctors coalition spends $4 million lobbying on 'surprise' medical billing\n\nA coalition of doctors groups owned by private equity firms and investment groups spent more than $4 million lobbying Congress last quarter on legislation that would end surprise medical bills.\n\nPhysicians for Fair Coverage spent $4.1 million between July 1 and Sept. 30, when the debate over surprise medical bills was heating up in Congress, according to lobbying disclosure reports filed Monday.\n\nIt's a record-high amount for the relatively new coalition, which spent less than $5,000 on lobbying during the same time period last year. The group spent $120,000 between April 1 and June 30 and $25,000 from Jan. 1 to March 31.\n\nThe lobbying campaign comes as Congress seeks to pass legislation banning providers from billing patients for costs not covered by insurance companies.\n\nThe practice can result in patients receiving costly bills, even if they seek care at in-network facilities but are unknowingly treated by doctors who don't participate in insurance networks and are employed by staffing firms.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHouse panel to consider vaping tax this week\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to consider a bill on Wednesday that would impose a tax on the nicotine used in vaping, Chairman Richard Neal Richard Edmund NealOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Partnership for America's Health Care Future \u2014 Four companies reach 0M settlement in opioid lawsuit | Deal opens door to larger settlements | House panel to consider vaping tax | Drug pricing markup tomorrow House Democrats ask judge to dismiss Trump lawsuit over NY tax return law On The Money: Trump dismisses 'phony Emoluments Clause' after Doral criticism | Senate Dems signal support for domestic spending package | House panel to consider vaping tax MORE (D-Mass.) announced Monday.\n\nThe panel will mark up a bipartisan bill introduced by Reps.

Suozzi's office said that the revenue raised by the vaping bill would be used to offset the cost of other bills the Ways and Means Committee is considering Wednesday that would require certain high-deductible health plans to cover the cost of inhalers, and that would allow people to use tax-advantaged accounts to purchase over-the-counter medications and menstrual-care products.\n\nThe announcement of the markup comes as policymakers have expressed concerns about vaping products in light of the spike in teen vaping and the spread of a mysterious respiratory illness that has sickened more than 1,000 people and led to more than 30 deaths.\n\n\"I applaud Chairman Neal and my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee for acting swiftly and decisively to get vaping products out of the hands of young people,\" Suozzi said in a statement. \"We must address this public health crisis now rather than waiting years to do so, as we did with cigarettes.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nSponsored Content - Partnership for America's Health Care Future\n\nMedicare for All, Medicare buy-in, and the public option would all ultimately lead to the same harmful consequences of higher taxes and lower quality of care.
