Despite the length of the exchange, though, significant questions remained for the prime minister.\n\n1. Why did Johnson fail to declare an interest over Arcuri and her companies when he was mayor of London?\n\nDuring her interview, Arcuri refused nine times to answer direct questions about whether she had an intimate relationship with Johnson. But she also made it clear that she shared a \u201cvery close bond\u201d with the then mayor of London. Johnson told The Andrew Marr Show last week that he had no interest to declare over Arcuri. But her comments on Monday suggest otherwise. She confirmed he visited her flat (where she said her office was also based) a \u201chandful\u201d of times, that they joked about pole dancing, talked about Shakespeare and technology, and that he spoke for free at four of her events. Despite the closeness of the relationship, Johnson\u2019s register of interests as mayor makes no mention of Arcuri or her companies.\n\n2. Why did Johnson\u2019s office intervene to give Arcuri a place on trade missions to Tel Aviv and New York after she was initially told she did not meet the criteria?\n\nArcuri suggested the initial decision to refuse her place was due to an overly restrictive interpretation of the criteria. She was initially refused a place on a technology trade trade trip to Singapore and Malaysia in 2014 because her company, Innotech, was an events company not a technology company. To get round this requirement she was allowed on the trip as representative of her new video technology company, Playbox, even though it had been trading less than the required 12 months necessary to qualify for a place.\n\nLondon and Partners [L&P], the mayor\u2019s promotion agency, which ran the trip, said it was not unusual for the rules to be waived in this way. But this exception made for Arcuri on the Singapore trip does not explain why she was subsequently allowed on trade missions to Tel Aviv and New York. Despite not qualifying for these events, L&P said one of the mayor\u2019s advisers said she should be allowed a place.\n\nArcuri on Monday insisted she was vetted by an \u201cextremely fierce\u201d woman in charge of the trips. \u201cShe didn\u2019t let me pass because I was Boris\u2019s friend. She wanted to know that I was actually doing real business there and spent time learning about me.\u201d Her answer still does not explain why one of Johnson\u2019s advisers intervened on Arcuri\u2019s behalf for the trade trips to New York and Tel Aviv.\n\n3. Why did the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) approach Arcuri\u2019s company before awarding her new company, Hacker House, \u00a3100,000 earlier this year?\n\nLots of questions have already been asked about how much the DCMS did to verify whether Hacker House was genuinely a UK company before awarding it \u00a3100,000 from a scheme aimed at fostering digital skills in this country. Arcuri insisted the company was based in the UK and had eight UK staff when the money was awarded. But she also claimed the DCMS suggested she should apply for the funds in the first place.\n\nShe said: \u201cThey came to us and said, \u2018Hey, we have this pot of money.\u2019 And I said: \u2018Wow, you have a pot of money to do exactly as we are doing with the technology we were building.\u2019 Why wouldn\u2019t you fund us?\u201d She insisted Johnson had \u201cabsolutely nothing to do with my grant\u201d. She was not asked why the DCMS approached her to apply, but she suggested officials were worried that not enough companies were applying for the funds.\n\nShe said: \u201cMy company has developed an extremely effective hands on hacking course, that allows people to enter industry based on the skills they achieve in my course. This is a massive problem across the UK and the United States. DCMS were far more concerned with fulfilling that quota and that need, so they came to us.\u201d\n\n4. Why did Arcuri claim that Johnson wrote her a letter of recommendation to run a tech quango?\n\nArcuri told ITV that her then friend Milo Yiannopoulos, the rightwing commentator, suggested she apply for the job of chief executive of Tech City, an organisation set up by Downing Street to champion technology companies in London. She suggested to ITV that she went along with the idea to humour Yiannopoulos.\n\nBut the Sunday Times reported that Arcuri boasted of still having a letter of recommendation from Johnson. It quoted an email from her as saying \u201cI still have the letter of rec from Boris. Hahaha. To think that we asked him to write us a recommendation for the CEO of Tech City is just hysterical.\u201d On Monday she said: \u201cThat letter doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Asked to explain the email, she said she was \u201cjust playing along\u201d.\n\n5. Why did Johnson speak at four Innotech events for free when he rarely spoke at other tech events?\n\nOther companies organising tech conferences in London at the time were puzzled by why Johnson only seemed to talk at Arcuri\u2019s event. She claimed he chose to attend her events on merit, saying: \u201cIt made him look like a rock star within the tech community \u2026 I produce really good, very sexy, chic, on-point, thought-leading events. There was no other events series like Innotech, none.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI always made sure that Boris got a win out of my events \u2026 Every event that he came to had a strategic advantage for him.\u201d But it is still unclear what strategic advantage Johnson gained. When he spoke at the launch event of Innotech in 2012, Arcuri admitted \u201cjaws hit the floor when he showed up\u201d. She suggested Johnson was doing it to secure her participation in his 2012 reelection campaign as mayor, saying: \u201cWhen he left, he said, \u2018Jenn, see you on the Boris bus,\u2019because I told him if you come to this, I\u2019ll help with your campaign.\u201d", "description": "Questions remain about Boris Johnson\u2019s relationship with businesswoman after her ITV appearance", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2939288ab8a09eccd355852c4383f7dba460e634/191_413_1410_846/master/1410.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8bf34b71f90e5444a8b929d1a00588c9", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
