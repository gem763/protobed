Ilhan Omar, according to TMZ, has filed for divorce from Ahmed Hirsi, the father of her three children.\n\nAnd all in the rest of the country go: What\u2019s going on with this Muslim Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, anyway? Her personal life doesn\u2019t just seem a personal mess. It\u2019s also, legally speaking, a curious mix of question marks and asterisks and puzzling twists and turns.\n\nThis will be her second separation from Hirsi.\n\nIt comes after she denied separating from him a few weeks ago.\n\nIt comes after Washington, D.C.-area\u2019s Beth Jordan Mynett, in divorce papers, accused her husband, Tim, of leaving her for Omar, for whom he provided political consulting services.\n\n\u201cThe parties physically separated on or about April 7, 2019, when Defendant told Plaintiff that he was romantically involved with and in love with another woman, Ilhan Omar,\u201d court documents stated at the time.\n\nIt comes after many in the media and politics \u2014 and country \u2014 have been wondering about the true nature of Omar\u2019s romantic partnerships, for legal reasons, no less. As TMZ wrote: \u201cHer divorce adds another layer to her complicated history with her now estranged husband, Hirsi. They reportedly married in a religious ceremony in 2002 \u2014 but the union was not recognized legally. The couple [then] had two children together, but separated in 2008.\u201d\n\nOmar then married another guy, Ahmed Elmi, in 2009 in Minneapolis. In 2011, he returned to the United Kingdom, and in 2017, the two legally divorced.\n\nThen Omar married Hirsi \u2014 \u201clegally this time,\u201d as TMZ noted \u2014 the following year.\n\nAnd now, they\u2019re divorcing.\n\nOmar filed the paperwork in court on Friday.\n\nOne of her spokespeople told TMZ: \u201cAs will all marriages, this is intensely personal and a difficult time for their family. For years, Ilhan and Ahmed have been the object of speculation and innuendo from political opponents and the media.\u201d\n\nUmm, yes. That\u2019s \u2018cause Omar never did put completely to rest accusations like this, as reported by Business Insider in July: \u201cConservative bloggers have for years claimed that Omar\u2019s second husband, a British citizen named Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, is her brother and that she married him to help him fraudulently gain a US green card.\u201d\n\nThe accusation is still that: an accusation without proof.\n\nBut: \u201cOmar has still not explained some puzzling discrepancies and inconsistencies in her marriage history that raise questions about her marriages and have breathed life into allegations of fraud,\u201d Business Insider wrote.\n\nAnd now the Federal Election Commission might be doing some snooping into her background. For more fraud.\n\n\u201cFederal campaign finance records show that Omar\u2019s campaign has paid nearly $230,000 since 2018 to the E. Street Group, a political strategy firm of which the lawmaker\u2019s alleged married lover, Tim Mynett, is a partner of,\u201d Breitbart reported in late August.\n\nThe National Legal and Policy Center filed a complaint with the FEC, requesting an investigation into the payments.\n\nThat\u2019s still up in the air.\n\nBut Omar\u2019s personal hasn\u2019t just leaked into her political. It\u2019s flooded. And the fact is when you can\u2019t answer a simple yes or no question like, \u201cAre you married?\u201d \u2014 without raising up the red flags \u2014 well then, that becomes a red flag in itself.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
