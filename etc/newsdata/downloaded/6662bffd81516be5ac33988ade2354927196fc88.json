A dupe is a product that in some ways works as well as \u2014 or better than \u2014 a fancier, more famous thing, and we're sharing our favorites. Welcome to Dupes Week. Photo: Courtesy Retailers\n\nAll of my most ambitious cooking happens in my Le Creuset Dutch oven. I\u2019ve braised chicken thighs with adobo chiles and vinegar for hours on end, until the apartment smells warm, like garlic and spice, and the meat nearly drips off the bone \u2014 and let it sit for another two hours before serving at a dinner party, only to realize that the dish inside was still hot. I tried my hand at a version of Julia Child\u2019s coq au vin recipe this winter, and I can\u2019t imagine saut\u00e9ing the bacon and browning the three pounds of chicken and simmering the half-bottle of red wine down to a thick, spoonable sauce in anything but a Le Creuset. (Plus there\u2019s nothing that feels more fancy than serving Julia\u2019s coq au vin in a fancy French Dutch oven.) But most of my everyday cooking happens in the Le Creuset, too. Just the other day, I made Alison Roman\u2019s stew, and I cooked the notoriously hard-to-brown chickpeas until they had a little bit of a crisp, and I wilted down more kale than the recipe could\u2019ve ever called for. Best of all, the white enameled interior didn\u2019t stain from the turmeric.\n\nTheoretically, you could do all of this cooking in any Dutch oven, but conventional wisdom is that Le Creuset makes the best Dutch oven that money can buy. And after years of using one in my own kitchen, I have to admit I\u2019m something of a Le Creuset acolyte. It\u2019s made of high-quality cast-iron, so it\u2019s known for heating evenly and efficiently, and there aren\u2019t really any hot spots while you saut\u00e9e or brown. The cast-iron also means the Le Creuset can retain that heat for hours on end, so your precious braising meat or thickening stew is really cooking in there. And the glossy, enamel finish makes it durable and relatively easy to clean, with warm water, soap, and a scrubber brush.\n\nBut boy, is it a lot of money. A 5.5-quart Le Creuset enameled cast-iron Dutch oven \u2014 the size and shape most people imagine when they talk about a Le Creuset \u2014 will cost you $350. That kind of purchase feels particularly excessive when there are so many different brands of enameled cast-iron Dutch ovens on the market that claim to do everything the Le Creuset does, at just a fraction of the price. So what is the difference, exactly, between all of these different brands of enameled Dutch ovens, and how do they compare to the OG?\n\nTo find out, I put six different Dutch ovens \u2014 AmazonBasics, Cuisinart, Dansk, Great Jones, Lodge, and Milo \u2014 up against my Le Creuset. (I excluded Staub from this lineup because, in my mind, it is a very different type of Dutch oven, even if it does come in a rainbow of candy-colored exteriors like Le Creuset. That\u2019s because Staub Dutch ovens have uncoated, matte-black interior; Le Creuset Dutch ovens, and all of theses dupes, have smooth, enameled insides.)\n\nTo make sure my testing was as fair as possible, and to do it in a way that wouldn\u2019t require me to turn on my oven in the middle of a New York City heat wave for hours at a time, I crafted an experiment: I put a quart of cold tap water in each Dutch oven and timed how long it took to come to a boil on my gas stove as a way to gauge conductivity and heat distribution. Once the water was boiling, I turned off the heat, covered the pot, and let it sit for an hour. At the hour mark, I took the temperature of the water (using my Thermapen, which gave an excellent instant reading) in an attempt to gauge heat retention and how tightly the lid sealed in liquids.\n\nLong story short: You shouldn\u2019t feel like a chump if you\u2019ve shelled out over $350 on the Le Creuset because it more than held its own during this process. In my hourlong heat-retention test, the water in the Le Creuset only dropped to 128 degrees Fahrenheit, making it the best-performing Dutch oven in this category. (The AmazonBasics Dutch oven did the worst, dropping down to 116 degrees, but the average temperature decrease across all seven Dutch ovens was 89 degrees, from 212 to 123 degrees.) And though this temperature differential isn\u2019t that much in the scheme of things, it does speak to the fact that Le Creuset has fine-tuned these small details (and that the exceptional heat retention and efficient heating I\u2019ve experienced as a cook isn\u2019t all in my head).\n\nBut some of the other things that make the Le Creuset special aren\u2019t as easily quantified. One factor that I didn\u2019t really take into consideration until all of the Dutch ovens were lined up in my kitchen is just how pretty the Le Creuset is. Yes, you may have spent $350 on this object, but at least it feels like an objet, something you can proudly leave on your kitchen stove, and that attention to aesthetics was something that was missing from some of the less-expensive options. It also has the widest color range of any Dutch oven on this list, so you can really match it to any d\u00e9cor. Plus the Le Creuset brand has a long heritage. It\u2019s the kind of thing you can pass along to the next generation \u2014 and has been many times already. My co-worker, for instance, cooks in a 30-year-old Le Creuset Dutch oven and reports that it works great.\n\nSo the reason to spend $350 on a Le Creuset Dutch oven is because you want it all: a high-performing enameled cast-iron Dutch oven that has a long legacy and will still look great on your stove in basically any color that you want. But if you\u2019re willing to compromise on any one of these features (something that many, many home cooks are!), you can still get a very good Dutch oven that, technically, does everything the Le Creuset does, from braising large cuts of fancy meat to making your favorite chickpea stew, all for much, much less. The question now is: Which Le Creuset dupe is the right one for you? I broke down your options, depending on what you want from your Dutch oven.\n\nIf you want a functional Le Creuset dupe\n\nCuisinart Chef's Classic Enameled Cast Iron 5-Quart Round Covered Casserole We\u2019ve written about the Cuisinart cast-iron casserole as a Le Creuset Dutch-oven dupe before, especially since it\u2019s often on sale at Amazon. But I had never actually used one before, and I was happy to see that, of all the Dutch ovens I tested, it performed the closest to a Le Creuset. In that heat-retention test, the temperature of the water only went down to 127 degrees, the second-best result after Le Creuset. It was also surprisingly stylish. Instead of trying to re-create the gradient of the Le Creuset, this Cuisinart Dutch oven was just red, with a matching red porcelain knob, that gave the whole thing a modern, monochromatic look. However, unlike Le Creuset, there are limited color options. Also, this Le Creuset dupe is missing the pedigree of the original. After all, Cuisinart\u2019s only been around since the 1970s, and it\u2019s really better known for its food processors than its cookware. That means I can\u2019t speak to this pot\u2019s longevity (and I don\u2019t know anyone who has inherited a Cuisinart Dutch oven). But for a fifth of the price of the Le Creuset, this Dutch oven a solid, functional, and mostly good-looking dupe, and if your progeny aren\u2019t a concern, that\u2019s probably all you need. $71 at Amazon Buy $71 at Amazon Buy\n\nIf you want a Le Creuset dupe with history\n\nDansk Kobenstyle White Casserole Let\u2019s get this out of the way: The Dansk Kobenstyle is enameled carbon steel, not enameled cast-iron, so I\u2019m not sure if it really counts as a dupe for the Le Creuset. However, I think it is one of the best alternatives and, of all the Dutch ovens I tested, comes the closest to hitting all of the same marks as the Le Creuset. It\u2019s highly functional. The carbon steel is light, certainly lighter than a Le Creuset, meaning it\u2019s easy to carry around a kitchen, even when it\u2019s hot, and it retains heat well, dropping down to just 126 degrees in my testing, compared to Le Creuset\u2019s 128. It\u2019s aesthetically pleasing, with a unique mid-century design and spiderlike handles that don\u2019t look like they should work but feel sturdy. It\u2019s got a history, and they\u2019ve been proved to stand the test of time. In fact, Samrin Nosrat uses a vintage Kobenstyle in her Netflix show, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, and as I explained at the time, these Danish-designed pots were first introduced in the mid-1950s but faded into obscurity until 2012, when Lenox, the company that now owns Dansk, started manufacturing them again. The Kobenstyle also has some features that the Le Creuset lacks, like a lid that can be repurposed as a trivet, and, best of all, it\u2019s under $100. One big downside to the Kobenstyle, however, is that the handles are a little hard to grasp while cooking. (In fact, I accidentally singed a hand towel on my gas stove while trying to stir some curry I was making in the pot.) The carbon steel also means it doesn\u2019t have the heavy bottom of a cast-iron Dutch oven, and that means it might not be the best choice for searing meat at high heat. But for $100, I\u2019d say the Kobenstyle is the most similar in spirit to a Le Creuset than any other Dutch oven on this list. $80 at Amazon Buy $80 at Amazon Buy\n\nIf you want an aesthetic Le Creuset dupe\n\nMilo Classic Dutch Oven In terms of performance, the Milo was decidedly average, with the water temperature dropping to 124 degrees in my heat-retention test. (Again, the average was 123.) But even if it wasn\u2019t the best-performing Dutch oven, it was far from the worst, and what it may have lacked in function, it more than made up for in clean aesthetics. I was pleasantly surprised by how closely it resembled the look and feel of my white Le Creuset Dutch oven without trying to be a d\u00f6ppelganger. The silver knob on the lid, for instance, has a similar feel to that of the Le Creuset, but it\u2019s refreshingly free of branding. There aren\u2019t any ridges on the lid, a feature that\u2019s emblematic of Le Creuset and many of its knockoffs, but I found the smooth, logo-free lid to look wonderfully clean. Even the width and heft of the Milo cast-iron is closest to that of the Le Creuset. And though Milo is an L.A.-based direct-to-consumer start-up that\u2019s only been around since 2017, it\u2019s been making Dutch ovens from the very beginning, and each pot comes with a lifetime (albeit limited) warranty, so you feel like you perhaps have stumbled upon the start of something, even if it\u2019s not over 90 years of French manufacturing. The color options on the Milo are even more limited than those offered by Cuisinart, however, and if you want the gloss finish on the interior, you have to get white. (The black Dutch oven, with a gold handle, is coated with satin enamel, meaning it\u2019s more porous and a bit more like a Staub than a Le Creuset.) $95 at Milo Buy\n\nIf you want a status-y Le Creuset dupe\n\nGreat Jones The Dutchess I struggle to think of any other cookware brands that have generated as much buzz as Great Jones. Since it launched in 2018, Great Jones has raised $3.35 million from investors like David Chang. (Full disclosure: One of the company\u2019s co-founders, Sierra Tishgart, is a former Grub Street editor and has written for the Strategist before.) Their signature product is called the Dutchess, a cast-iron Dutch oven that really stands out from the crowd owing to its matte exterior, the gold U-shaped hardware on the lid, and wide oval shape. It\u2019s a status Dutch oven for the Instagram era, and fortunately, its appeal doesn\u2019t end with good looks. The oval shape means there\u2019s a lot of surface area to cook on, which would be great for big batches or stews. The gray interior is tastefully different, and I imagine it wouldn\u2019t stain as quickly as the white interior of my Le Creuset has. The matte finish is lovely, and the green I received is vibrant without looking tacky. The color range is also wide, with a bright yellow, and Yves Klein\u2013esque blue, and a limited-edition millennial pink all available, in addition to a white or black. One drawback, at least for my small New York City kitchen, is that signature oval shape. When the Dutchess was on my (admittedly smaller-than-average) four-burner stove, I could only really fit one other pot on it. And because the Dutch oven was essentially too big for my burner, it also took the longest time to boil a quart of water (almost 12 minutes). It must also be said that even though the Great Jones Dutch oven is less than half the price of a Le Creuset, it\u2019s still the most expensive pick on this list. But if you\u2019re looking for a slightly cooler pick for a wedding registry than a Le Creuset that\u2019s also less expensive, the Dutchess is it. $145 at Great Jones Buy\n\nIf you want the cheapest Le Creuset dupe\n\nLodge 6 Quart Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven We\u2019ve written glowingly about the Lodge cast-iron Dutch oven before, so I was expecting to be blown away by this enameled Dutch oven\u2019s performance. Unfortunately, my experience wasn\u2019t exceptional. It took over 11 minutes to get a quart of water to boil, about 20 seconds longer than it took the Le Creuset, and the temperature of the water dropped to 119 degrees over the course of an hour, well below the average heat retention (and the second-lowest result). It also, quite frankly, looked kind of bulbous and felt a little bulky. The red gradient \u2014 which is a clear take on Le Creuset\u2019s cerise, a tasteful red gradient that goes from a crimson to scarlet \u2014 looked a little clumsy as it raced from black to cherry Slurpee. But with all of that in mind, if you really are looking to spend the least amount of money possible for the best enameled Dutch oven you can, this is it (and really, given the results of the even-cheaper options, I wouldn\u2019t suggest you spend less than this). One feature that I especially liked about the Lodge, not available from any other Dutch oven on this list, was the rounded interior. That means your spoon won\u2019t get stuck on the edge, between the bottom and the side, while stirring. Plus, it\u2019s got a wide range of colors, even if they might be a bit brighter than those offered by Le Creuset, including some limited-edition colors, like this fun melodramatic purple or Gen-Z yellow. Lodge is also a company with history, founded in 1896 in Tennessee, and it\u2019s been making cast-iron cookware ever since. So even if it wasn\u2019t my all-time favorite pick, especially on the aesthetics front, it is a brand that\u2019s stood the test of time, and it does everything you\u2019d want a Dutch oven to do at the lowest price possible. $60 at Amazon Buy $60 at Amazon Buy\n\nLe Creuset Signature Stainless Steel Knob \u2013 Medium If you already own a Lodge Dutch oven and want to give it a little zhuzh, you can buy a single Le Creuset stainless steel knob and swap it on the lid. It\u2019s a little hack I learned from a friend, who did just that when the original handle on her Lodge Dutch oven got wobbly and eventually came off. She swears you can\u2019t tell the difference now. $19 at Amazon Buy $19 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
