The Australian constitution protects freedom of religion and state anti-discrimination laws in nearly all states and territories provide protection against discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs and activities.\"\n\nHe called for a statement of belief provisions to be removed from the draft, along with indirect discrimination provisions and a reverse onus of proof.\n\nThe Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has also called for a rethink of the laws, arguing the definition of \"religious belief or activity\" should be clarified.\n\nThe Law Council of Australia said \"new and unorthodox protections\" designed to prioritise freedom of religious expression may trump the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of race, sex, sexual orientation, disability and age.\n\nPresident Arthur Moses SC said significant and concerning departures from other anti-discrimination laws were included in the draft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Contrary to domestic and international law, they prioritise the protection of freedom of religious expression over other well-established rights,\u201d he said.\n\nLaw Council president Arthur Moses. AAP\n\nLawyers are concerned about the departure from the established \u201creasonableness\u201d test in indirect discrimination law for resolving disputes; the restriction of employer conduct rules which risks affording undue emphasis to the rights of employees to manifest their religion outside the workplace; and a dilution of health practitioner conduct rules.\n\n\"Freedom from discrimination on the ground of religion, and the freedom to manifest one\u2019s religion, are important human rights that should be vigorously upheld,\" Mr Moses said.\n\n\"But the same applies to other human rights, such as the right not to be discriminated against on other grounds such as race, sex, sexual orientation, disability, or age.\n\n\"This is really a debate about what type of Australia do we want to be. The peaceful and harmonious diversity we have achieved in Australia is the envy of other nations.\n\n\"It should not be tinkered with by knee-jerk reaction legislation that may have unintended consequences. The bill, if enacted, would create significant new rights at the expense of other rights. \u201c", "description": "Lawyers and business groups warn changing the balance of rights to the protection of religious beliefs could create complex legal workplace problems.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_94/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ce48fd8579f9f79c81955eb6ad4aef2731b08400", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
