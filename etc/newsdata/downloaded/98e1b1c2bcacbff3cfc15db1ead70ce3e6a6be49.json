Levandowski, 39, is a former Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.31% GOOG, -0.40% engineer who left for Uber Technologies Inc. UBER, -0.58% and allegedly took thousands of files on Google\u2019s self-driving-car developments with him, leading to a dramatic civil lawsuit.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Waymo and Uber ended up settling that lawsuit, but the judge in the case referred Levandowski to federal authorities for a possible investigation. On Tuesday, charges were filed: Levadowski surrendered in San Jose, Calif., where a federal judge set bail at $3 million, and required an electronic monitoring bracelet, saying Levandowski is a high flight risk. He faces 33 charges of theft, each carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution.\n\nBased on evidence collected and presented in the civil trial, which started with a bang but ended prematurely with a whimper, Levandowski definitely took the files at the heart of the charges. But the case, the first one by a new corporate-fraud strike force in the northern district of California, is not as open and shut as the government would like it to sound.\n\n\u201c[A criminal case] has a much higher bar,\u201d said James Pooley, a Silicon Valley attorney who specializes in intellectual-property law, adding that the government has to prove that what Levandowski took with him was \u201ca trade secret, that it was valuable, and it was stolen, and you have to prove all that without a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nMore from Therese: The tech behind Google-Uber legal beef could be ready to boom\n\nEric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, and Pooley pointed out that the government is going to have to prove that Levandowski downloaded the documents with intent to do harm to Waymo, that he believed these were trade secrets and that he intended to misuse them.\n\n\u201cYou start with this seemingly damning fact that Levandowski took 14,000 documents from Google servers, but that\u2019s not the end...The government has to prove that at least one of those was a trade secret, and that Anthony Levandowski didn\u2019t have the right to access,\u201d Goldman said.\n\nLevandowski\u2019s attorney, Miles Ehrlich, told reporters in San Jose that the defense will have an answer for each and every allegation, point by point.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is going to show conclusively that Anthony did not steal anything, not from Google, not from anyone,\u201d Ehrlich said on CBS News. \u201cThe allegations in this case are basically a rehash of claims that were already discredited in a civil lawsuit between Waymo and Uber that settled over a year ago.\u201d\n\nFor more: Want to invest in self-driving cars? Check out the chips\n\nThat case began in 2017, when the self-driving-car business of Alphabet filed a lawsuit against the then-privately-held Uber. One of the main allegations in the suit \u2014 that Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents from Waymo\u2019s servers, including schematic drawings, weeks before he quit \u2014 was never in dispute. Levandowski quit Waymo to form his own self-driving-truck startup, Otto Technologies, which was purchased by Uber several months later.\n\nDespite those damning facts, Waymo struggled in the civil trial to prove that the trade secrets Levandowski took were essential to Uber\u2019s designs for self-driving cars, and were used in the rival\u2019s designs.\n\n\u201cThe judge kept kicking out Waymo\u2019s arguments as to what was a trade secret,\u201d Goldman of SCU said. \u201cA lot of Waymo\u2019s arguments were narrowed substantially.\u201d\n\nSee also: Elon Musk is just another car salesman\n\nBut Goldman cautioned that no conclusions should be made from the civil trial. Levandowski was not a party in the civil lawsuit, as his departure from Waymo was covered by an arbitration clause, and he was expected to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights if he had been subpoenaed to testify.\n\n\u201cAnthony Levandowski is innocent of these charges,\u201d his attorney, Ehrlich, said Tuesday. \u201cThe government has it dead wrong.\u201d\n\nLevandowski has stepped down from his position as CEO at his latest self-driving software startup, called Pronto, just as he was fired from Uber as that legal fight happened. He collected hundreds of millions of dollars from both Uber and Google, and has continued to work in the industry long after taking the documents.\n\nProsecutors seem determined to make Levandowski pay for those actions, but the government has a tough burden of proof, even in a case that at first glance might seem open and shut. Whether this case will go to a trial or a settlement \u2014 or both, like its predecessor \u2014 is the next big question as round two of a Silicon Valley legal drama begins.", "description": "The trade-secret theft case that initially captured Silicon Valley\u2019s attention back in 2017 returned as a major criminal action Tuesday, but with much...", "authors": ["Therese Poletti"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FY419_levand_ZG_20171115145123.jpg"}
