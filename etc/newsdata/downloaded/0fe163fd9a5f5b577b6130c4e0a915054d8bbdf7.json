Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a Democratic presidential candidate, speaks at a town hall-style campaign event at the University of Nevada, Reno, Oct. 3, 2019. (Tiffany Brown Anderson/The New York Times)\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Sen. Kamala Harris of California kicked off perhaps the most important month of her stalled presidential bid in the shadow of America\u2019s casino capital, a fitting start to an October in which she and her campaign staff will put their chips on the table.\n\nGone is the hubris from the start of her candidacy, when some top advisers asserted privately that the early 2020 nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire were not crucial \u2014 a decision that baffled rival campaigns and even some Harris staff members on the ground who had suggested more early investment.\n\nNow Harris is staking her campaign on a top-three finish in Iowa, and her own words point to a candidate trying to reset expectations: shedding the label of a once-feared top candidate (she has fallen to fifth place in national polling) and reasserting herself as a punchy upstart.\n\n\u201cI stand here as a United States senator, a former attorney general of a state of 40 million people and a top-tier candidate for president of the United States!\u201d she told striking autoworkers this past week outside a General Motors plant in Reno, Nevada.\n\nAfter support for Harris surged after her performance in the first Democratic debate in June, her downward trajectory the past three months has gained notice. Her third-quarter fundraising was flat, undergirded by a heavy schedule of high-dollar events that kept her away from the trail. She now polls closer to lesser known candidates like technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang than to Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nSome challenges were thrust upon her: heightened expectations after a better-than-expected start; the burden of a historic candidacy that has no touchstone; and the rise of Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, who has become a favorite of the donor circuit that once preferred Harris. At a recent dinner for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the reception for Warren dwarfed the one for Harris, igniting chatter across the community that Harris considers a home base.\n\nOther blips were self-inflicted. Most notably, Harris entered the race as a sponsor of Sanders\u2019 plan for single-payer health insurance, only to later denounce it and offer her own.\n\nNo Democrat questions her competence or political skill. She rattled Biden in the first debate, won plaudits for her tough questioning of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet members during Senate hearings and earned high favorability ratings from primary voters that could indicate room for growth.\n\nBut she has had trouble stringing together individual moments and converting them into sustained support, and interviews with voters at a series of campaign events in Nevada revealed that even some who planned to vote for her were yearning to see a clearer, more consistent expression of her political vision.\n\n\u201cI feel like, a couple times, she came out as a fighter and was aggressive \u2014 and then she backs off,\u201d said Traci Decker, 42, who attended the Las Vegas event. \u201cI want to see her keep pushing.\u201d\n\nSofia Takhtadjian, 18, said she thought that each time she had seen Harris on the Democratic debate stage, her message had been different.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard rebuttals, and single opinions, but I think she needs her own personal image,\u201d Takhtadjian said. \u201cShe needs to show her own beliefs.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s left is a schism between those who think Harris\u2019 summer struggles were a temporary dip caused by her relative absence on the trail, and those who believe something more fundamental is at play \u2014 that her catchall ideology is a mismatch for a political moment defined by clear progressives like Warren and Sanders and moderates like Biden.\n\nAt campaign events this past week, Harris debuted a fresh stump speech focused on the impeachment inquiry into Trump, an issue in which her campaign believes she is uniquely suited to lead as a former prosecutor.\n\nShe began each of the rallies, titled \u201cDude Gotta Go,\u201d with a lengthy discussion of the president\u2019s suspected crimes, and concluded by talking directly about the idea of \u201celectability,\u201d which she described as the \u201celephant\u201d in the 2020 race, and the fear that the country was not ready to elect a black woman as president.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have some real talk,\u201d Harris said in Reno. \u201cThis is not a new conversation for me. This is a conversation that I\u2019ve heard every time I\u2019ve ran a campaign and \u2014 here\u2019s the operative word \u2014 won.\u201d", "description": "LAS VEGAS -- Sen.
