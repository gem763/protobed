Saudi Arabia to Waive \u2018Expat Fees\u2019 for Industrial Companies\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia will waive the controversial fees it requires industrial companies to pay for their foreign workers for a period of five years, lightening a burden on the private sector.\n\nSince January 2018, businesses have been required to pay fees for foreign workers they employ, part of the government\u2019s strategy to raise non-oil revenue and encourage companies to hire Saudis. Many businesses, accustomed to cheaper foreign labor, have struggled to adapt to the fees, which were imposed at the same time as subsidy cuts and a value-added tax.\n\nThe levies contributed to an exodus of foreign laborers, hitting the economy without making much of a dent in Saudi unemployment.\n\nIn February, King Salman approved a $3.1 billion plan to ease the levies and help revive economic growth, but some businesses said the measures didn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nThe cabinet on Tuesday announced that the state will temporarily cover the cost of the fees for licensed industrial companies, according to the official Saudi Press Agency. The cabinet statement didn\u2019t provide further details.\n\nRead More: Saudi Arabia Is Said To Review Expat Fees as Economy Feels Sting\n\nThere are two types of fees on foreign workers in the kingdom.
