They came from a lot of countries,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAnd I actually said to them, if you don\u2019t take them, I\u2019m going to drop them right on your border and you can have fun capturing them again.\u201d\n\nMr Trump suggested that if detainees escape Kurdish-controlled camps, the US will not \u201ccapture people that want to go back to Germany, France, UK and other parts of Europe\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey could walk back - they can\u2019t walk to our country. We have lots of water in between our country and them,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Trump has made similar threats several times in the past, saying earlier this month that he was unconcerned over the potential escape of Isis fighters because \u201cthey\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe\u201d.\n\nIn August, the US president claimed he would \u201crelease [thousands of Isis fighters] to Europe\u201d if they were not repatriated but the threat has never materialised.\n\nThe US does not directly control the prisons and camps where foreign fighters, female Isis members and their children are being held by Kurdish forces.\n\nNumerous escapes have been reported since Mr Trump ordered the US military to withdraw from Syria earlier this month, sparking a Turkish-backed incursion into the areas where Isis members were detained.\n\nDivisions between the captives have also sparked assassinations and unrest inside the camps, amid warnings of a potential Isis insurgence.\n\nIn the last audio message released before his death, Baghdadi directly called for his followers to free detained Isis members and their families from camps.\n\nDozens of jihadis from the UK and at least 60 British children who fled Isis-held areas as the group\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d fell are thought to be held in northern Syria, including Shamima Begum and Jack Letts.\n\nTwo members of the British Isis terror cell known as The Beatles have already been transferred to US custody for trial over the torture and execution of hostages including James Foley and David Haines.\n\nKurdish commanders in the region have told The Independent they cannot secure Isis prisons and camps if fighting with Turkish forces continues in spite of a Russia-brokered ceasefire.\n\n\u201cWe are still maintaining control but if the Turkish threat and attacks continue, we do not know for how long we will be able to keep these prisons secured,\u201d said Syrian Defence Forces commander Mervan Qamishli.\n\n\u201cWe need help stopping the conflict so that our forces can return to protecting and managing the prisons.\u201d\n\nAmerican officials say that at least 100 Isis fighters have already escaped in the two weeks since Turkey launched its incursion against Kurdish fighters, which were allied to the US-led coalition but considered terrorists by Ankara.\n\nKurdish officials estimate that an additional 800 Isis family members may have also fled from Ain Issa camp, which was home to more than 100,000 displaced people.\n\nThere are also fears over the security of the al-Hol and Roj camps, which are each home to significant populations of foreign Isis suspects.\n\nThe British government has refused to repatriate captives for trial and dramatically increased its use of controversial citizenship deprivation powers to prevent any return to the UK.\n\nReports suggest it may be preparing to transfer children of British jihadis who have been trapped in the warzone, although it is unclear whether the policy would only apply to unaccompanied children and orphans, or those still with their parents.\n\nSeveral MPs have called for the government to repatriate UK extremists, which Kurdish officials called Britain\u2019s \u201cmoral and legal duty\u201d.\n\nIn August, former defence minister Tobias Ellwood warned that the detention of thousands of jihadis and their families in Syria was creating conditions for an Isis resurgence and global terror attacks.\n\n(AFP via Getty) More", "description": "Donald Trump has threatened to \u201cdrop\u201d captured Isis fighters on the UK border if the government does not start repatriating them from Syrian camps.Speaking at a press conference where he announced the death of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the US president called European nations a \u201ctremendous disappointment", "authors": ["Lizzie Dearden"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9Jktr.F1975qgQiOWkltUw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/75af55b924b0ca983d18e8be88ae3ccd", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
