For about ten hours today for a deposition he's significant DeVon because he's one of those three diplomats in this a text messages that we've been talking about back could. A potentially reveal a quid pro quo he was the one as you mention I replied back to the other diplomats involved in the sense that it would be crazy. Two with hole about political arm to withhold aid to Ukraine. In exchange for political investigations so what were told by our sources is that.

A lean change very quickly Democrats jumped on this comment by the president criticizing him for using that word. And evoking a very painful part of this country's history. I he does have some defenders though senator Lindsey Graham a Republican from South Carolina and it told our Mario con on Capitol Hill that this is a lynching in everything. And Tim got the other Republican senator from South Carolina the only African American Republican in the senate. Said that yes this is no question that the impeachment process is the closest thing to a political death row trial but he did say. He would not have used the word lynching I think this is all just showing the president's. Growing frustrations. Yesterday it wasn't just the Democrats of course the is gonna continue to criticize the impeachment inquiry but DeVon the president also said that Republicans need to get tougher. He said they need to defend him more. And I he is certainly sounding off an airing their frustration Karen Travers force at the White House and our thanks to Katherine folders.
