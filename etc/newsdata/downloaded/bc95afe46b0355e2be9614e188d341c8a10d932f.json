Australian demonstrators called for their nation, which is the world\u2019s largest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas, to take more drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOrganizers estimate more than 300,000 protesters took to Australian streets in what would be the largest demonstrations in the country since the Iraq War began in 2003.\n\nAssociated Press Protesters with placards participate in the Global Strike 4 Climate rally in Sydney. Thousands of protesters are gathering at rallies around Australia as a day of worldwide demonstrations begins ahead of a U.N. climate summit in New York.\n\nSimilar rallies were planned Friday in cities around the globe. In the United States more than 800 events were planned, while in Germany more than 400 rallies were expected.\n\nAnd see: Half of polled Americans believe climate urgency is a \u2018crisis\u2019 or a \u2018serious problem\u2019 as 2020 election looms\n\nIn New Delhi, one of the world\u2019s most polluted cities, dozens of students and environmental activists chanted \u201cWe want climate action\u201d and \u201cI want to breathe clean\u201d at a rally outside the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.\n\nThey carried banners with some displaying messages like \u201cThere is no Earth B.\u201d\n\nHundreds of people marched in Thailand\u2019s capital and staged a \u201cdie-in\u201d outside the Ministry of Natural Resources to demand the government declare a climate emergency, ban coal energy by 2025 and completely replace fossil fuel energy with renewable energy by 2040.\n\nIn Hong Kong, where near-daily protests all summer have demanded greater democracy, about 50 people found a different reason to demonstrate: climate change.\n\nAssociated Press Environmental activists hold placards during a rally outside the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in suburban Manila, Philippines. Various environmental groups in the country are participating in what is expected to be the world's largest mobilization on climate change known as \"Global Climate Strikes.\"\n\nCarrying banners and posters, they chanted \u201cStop the pollution\u201d as they marched along the harbor front under a blazing sun.\n\nThe protests are partly inspired by the activism of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who has staged weekly demonstrations under the heading \u201cFridays for Future\u201d over the past year, calling on world leaders to step up their efforts against climate change. Many who have followed her lead are students, but the movement has since spread to civil society groups.\n\nSimilar coordinated protests in March drew crowds around the world.\n\nProtests were staged in 110 towns and cities across Australia on Friday, with organizers demanding government and business commit to a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2030.\n\nAustralian universities said they would not penalize students for attending Friday\u2019s rallies, while Australian schools varied on what action, if any, they would take against children who skipped classes to attend demonstrations.\n\nSiobhan Sutton, a 15-year-old student at Perth Modern School, said she would fail a math exam by attending a protest in the west coast city of Perth.\n\n\u201cI have basically been told that because it is not a valid reason to be missing school \u2014 it is not a medical reason or anything \u2014 I am going to get a zero on the test if I don\u2019t actually sit it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEven though we ourselves aren\u2019t sick, the planet which we live on is, and we are protesting and fighting for it,\u201d she added.\n\nSiobhan said her math teacher had given her the option to sit the exam before Friday, but she was unable to do so because of her commitments as one of the protest organizers.\n\nActing Prime Minister Michael McCormack said students should be in school.\n\n\u201cThese sorts of rallies should be held on a weekend where it doesn\u2019t actually disrupt business, it doesn\u2019t disrupt schools, it doesn\u2019t disrupt universities,\u201d McCormack told reporters in Melbourne.\n\n\u201cI think it is just a disruption,\u201d he added.\n\nSchool Strike 4 Climate said 265,000 protesters turned out at demonstrations in seven Australian cities alone. The largest crowd was an estimated 100,000 in Melbourne, followed by 80,000 in Sydney.\n\nRead: Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg urges U.S. lawmakers to listen to scientists and \u2018take real action\u2019\n\nMost police services declined to release their own crowd estimates. Organizers put the crowd in Brisbane at 30,000, while police estimated 12,000. Organizers said 15,000 rallied in Canberra, but police said 7,000.\n\nAustralian police have a reputation for underestimating by half crowd numbers at protests.\n\nThe demonstrations come as Australia\u2019s center-left opposition mulls abandoning its policy, rejected at May elections, of reducing Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by 45% below 2005 levels by 2030. Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s conservative coalition won a surprise third term with a commitment to reduce emissions by a more modest 26% to 28% in the same time frame.\n\nAssociated Press A large inflatable globe is bounced through the crowd as thousands of protestors in Australia, where acting deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack has described ongoing climate rallies as \"just a disruption\" that should have been held on a weekend to avoid inconveniencing communities.\n\nMorrison is in the U.S. for a state dinner with President Donald Trump on Friday and has been criticized for failing to include in his New York itinerary the U.N. climate summit on Monday, when leaders will present their long-term plans for curbing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSome companies are encouraging their employees to join the climate strike.\n\nAustralian Council of Trade Unions, which represents labor unions, said it supported employees taking time off work to protest.\n\nThe council said in a statement that it \u201cmust take a stand for our future when our government will not.\u201d\n\nThe demonstrations in 2003 that protested Australia sending combat troops to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq were the largest since the Vietnam War.", "description": "Tens of thousands of protesters joined rallies on Friday as a day of worldwide demonstrations calling for action against climate change began ahead of a U.N....", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR707_climat_ZG_20190920090529.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
