REUTERS/Henry Romero\n\nJustice Eduardo Medina Mora, 62, quit this week more than 10 years before his term was due to end, in the midst of a probe into his financial affairs that was initially started by the government\u2019s financial intelligence unit.\n\nMedina Mora, who in June rejected imputations made against him in a media report that he had engaged in financial irregularities, has yet to comment publicly on why he resigned.\n\nLopez Obrador was asked to give his opinion on what motivated Medina Mora during a regular news conference.\n\n\u201cI think the justice wants to deal with complaints submitted,\u201d the president said, adding that the complaint was now in the hands of the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nLopez Obrador said he had not spoken to Medina Mora about his resignation and would not anticipate the outcome of the attorney general\u2019s work.\n\nHe noted, however, that a complaint had been filed and said he had given instructions that whenever information came to light relating to money transfers that could prove suspicious, the attorney general\u2019s office was to be handed the case immediately.\n\nMedina Mora\u2019s exit opens up the possibility of Lopez Obrador nominating a successor who is more sympathetic to the president\u2019s policies than some longer-serving justices.\n\nCritics of the popular 65-year-old president have raised concerns about the independence of the court under his administration, complaints that he has rejected.\n\nLopez Obrador, who lives frugally and prides himself on his austerity, became embroiled in a stand-off with the court days after taking office. Attacking the judges\u2019 pay, he called them the \u201cbest paid public servants in the world.\u201d\n\nIn March, the Senate picked the wife of a business ally of Lopez Obrador to fill another vacancy on the court.\n\nLopez Obrador, who has vowed to root out corruption in Mexico, said in June that the financial intelligence unit had received information on Medina Mora from U.S. authorities.\n\nThis information was later passed to the attorney general\u2019s office as per his instructions, Lopez Obrador said.\n\nMedina Mora, a onetime ambassador of Mexico to Britain and later to the United States, was picked for the Supreme Court by former president Enrique Pena Nieto in 2015.", "description": "The Mexican Supreme Court Justice who resigned this week likely did so because of questions about possible financial wrongdoing raised against him, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437077218&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9318E", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
