I'm telling you the truth and I'm telling you this, and I don't know what to do. You still don't trust me.\"\n\nSpeaking to Rolling Stone, Isabella revealed that she had been dating the unnamed guy for about six months on and off before they broke up a year ago.\n\nBut last week, as she was deleting old messages on her phone, when she came across one from her ex and was struck by how much her feelings for him had changed.\n\n(Image: TikTok)\n\n\"It had really bothered me [to hear the message] at the time, but at this point it was just funny.\"\n\nSo she decided to share it on social media and dance along to it, showing she really didn't care about his words anymore.\n\nThe video has garnered over 395,000 likes and since posting Isabella has gained around 20,000 new followers.\n\nMoreover, her video has inspired dozens of other women to make their own version.\n\nTenley Earles from Virginia, thought Isabella's video was \"really empowering\" and after stumbling across a recording of her ex-boyfriend berating her for wearing leggings to school, she decided to make her own dance clip.\n\nAs before, her video went viral, racking up more than 723,000 likes and thousands of comments.\n\nIt has also been shared on Twitter , as an example of \"toxic masculinity\".\n\nFilm critic K. Austin Collins shared it, writing: \"Your sons are truly out of their f***ing minds, but your daughters are honestly funny as hell.\"", "description": "A new trend has cropped up online which sees women creating interpretive dances to voicemail messages from their exes", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Tiktok"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715050.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_241019SLUG_6988JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
