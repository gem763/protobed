He sends his best wishes to Tennessee and Michigan, both teams that are likely to take big Ls. USA TODAY\n\nShocking disappointments and better-than-expected performances are anticipated each weekend in the wild world of college football. Even if everyone knows they are coming, guessing when and where they will happen is difficult.\n\nThe USA TODAY Sports college football staff \u2014 Jace Evans, Paul Myerberg, George Schroeder, Erick Smith, Eddie Timanus and Dan Wolken \u2014 weigh in with some bold predictions for Week 8 of the college football season:\n\nJace Evans\n\nAt least two teams will fall from the ranks of the unbeaten \u2013 there\u2019s 12 remaining in FBS \u2013 this week as we move ever further into conference play. The most likely candidates? SMU and Baylor. The Mustangs are off to their best start since the \u201cPony Express\u201d days, but they face a stiff challenge this weekend against Temple. The Owls are 5-1 in Rod Carey\u2019s first season, having already knocked off two Power Five teams and a then-ranked Memphis squad in AAC play. The Bears for their part have to go to Stillwater to face a dynamic Oklahoma State team coming off a loss and a bye.\n\nBaylor quarterback Charlie Brewer reacts after a touchdown run against Texas Tech during the second half at McLane Stadium.

There was a time long ago, way back in 2007 or 2008, when Wake topping the Seminoles caused mass shock. This one won\u2019t even move the needle. Look for a high-scoring game that goes the Demon Deacons\u2019 way and ends with Willie Taggart under even higher scrutiny heading into the end of the month.\n\nIMPACT GAMES: Five matchups in Week 8 that will decide the playoff\n\nSTAFF PICKS: Michigan-Penn State plus Pac-12 showdowns on top\n\nCRYSTAL BALL: Predictions for the second half in college football\n\nGeorge Schroeder\n\nUtah was the preseason pick in the Pac-12 South. And despite an inexplicable loss to Southern California, the Utes remain formidable. But Arizona State has risen beyond any expectations for the team this year, especially with a true freshman quarterback. The Sun Devils get it done, upsetting Utah and taking control of the divisional race.\n\nErick Smith\n\nSouth Carolina didn't have much time to enjoy its win against Georgia after looking down at the schedule and seeing Florida next. But this game is in Columbia and the emotions will be high.\n\nEven with Ryan Hilinski banged up and third-strong quarterback Dakereon Joyner possibly forced into action for the Gamecocks, don't be surprised if they're competitive and even take down the Gators, who might be peaking ahead to their showdown with Georgia coming next.\n\nEddie Timanus\n\nYour sneaky-good game of the weekend is in the American Athletic Conference. No, not that one. SMU and Temple are indeed staging a Top 25 showdown, but the one we have in mind here is Tulane at Memphis.\n\nThe Green Wave have played in several thrillers already, most notably their win against Houston that involved some late trickery and last-play heroics.\n\nThis one will be close as well, but we\u2019ll give the nod to the host Tigers. They\u2019ll be back home after dropping a squeaker at Temple, but the Memphis coaching staff has done a good job of adapting. Do give it a look, though. It should be fun.\n\nDan Wolken\n\nI couldn't quite bring myself to pick Louisville to upset Clemson this week, but I do think this is going to be a very scary game for the Tigers. Louisville has really played well offensively of late and scored 62 at Wake Forest last weekend. First-year coach Scott Satterfield is an excellent play caller, he's getting the most out of his guys right now and I think that offense is tricky to prepare for if you've never seen it before. I could see Louisville feeding off the energy at home and taking a 14-0 lead early if Clemson comes out a little sluggish and making it a real fight deep into the second half. Ultimately, Clemson will wear Louisville down a bit and win the game but I think this will be one of the more difficult games remaining for the Tigers.", "description": "Expect the unexpected in college football each weekend.
