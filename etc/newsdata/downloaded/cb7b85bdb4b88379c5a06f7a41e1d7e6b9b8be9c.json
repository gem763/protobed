I\u2019m telling you that Che Guevara was a veritable Mr. Mom, with shades of Ward Cleaver and Fred Mac Murray as Steven Douglas in \"My Three Sons\"!\n\nYou see, amigos: an author for Smithsonian.com recently went on a motorcycle tour of Cuba with Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara\u2019s son Ernesto as tour guide. The passage above pretty much sums up the hard-nosed \u201cinsights\u201d provided by the article.\n\n\u201cSanta Clara was the site of Che\u2019s greatest victory during the Cuban revolutionary war of 1956-59,\u201d the Smithsonian author writes about the utterly bogus Cuban guerrilla \u201cwar.\u201d \u201cIt was then the crossroads of the island\u2019s transportation system and a key strategic goal in the armed rebellion led by Fidel Castro against the U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista.\n\nConsider that in an article written from and about a serious sh*thole of a Stalinist nation, whose article subject (Che Guevara) co-founded a regime that jailed and tortured political prisoners at a higher rate than Stalin\u2019s during the Great Terror, and murdered more Cubans in his first three years in power than Hitler murdered Germans during his first six \u2013consider that in such an article the word \u201cdictator\u201d only appears in relation to Cuba\u2019s leader prior to the mass-torturing, mass-murdering Stalinist regime.\n\nIn fact, the word \u201cdictator\u201d only appears in relation to the Cuba that boasted a higher standard of living than half of Europe and was inundated with more immigrants per-capita than is the U.S. today\u2014and this at a time when Cubans were perfectly free to emigrate from Cuba with all of their possessions and could get U.S. visas for the asking. All during that time more Americans lived in Cuba than did Cubans in the U.S.\n\n\u201cChe could not rest while there was injustice still in the world,\u201d the Smithsonian author approvingly quotes the curator of Cuba\u2019s Che Guevara museum. \u201cWithin 25 months (of landing in Cuba from Mexico) the odd couple (Fidel and Che) were in control of Cuba,\u201d continues the Smithsonian author, \u201cwith Che given the job of overseeing the execution of Batista\u2019s most vicious thugs.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at some of these \u201cvicious thugs\u201d shall we, and from an eye-witness not beholden to a Stalinist regime- after thorough vetting to assure his sympathy for the Stalinist regime-- for his \u201cjournalism\u201d visa, (as was the Smithsonian author).\n\nA Spanish priest named Javier Arzuaga had the misfortune to preside over the Havana parish that included the city\u2019s La Cabana Fortress which Che converted into Cuba\u2019s firing-squad and torture-central in January 1959.\n\nDuring his painful rounds father Arzuaga was shocked to find a 16-year-old boy named Ariel Lima among the condemned \u201cwar-criminals\u201d crammed into the dungeons and torture chambers. The priest described the boy as totally dazed with his teeth constantly chattering and probably mentally-handicapped.\n\nAstoundingly, father Arzuaga managed to get an audience with executioner-in-chief Che Guevara, where he pleaded the boy\u2019s case. \u201cQuickly I realized my pleas were pointless,\" recalls the priest. \u201cThe harder I pleaded for his compassion, the wider and crueler became Che Guevara\u2019s famous sneer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, fine. We\u2019ll take it up tonight at the Tribunal of Appeals,\u201d Che finally said while continuing to sneer at the distraught priest.\n\nBut what Che did at the \u201cappeals hearing,\u201d (that was attended by little Ariel\u2019s single mother) was confirm the death sentence and schedule the firing squad murder for that very night.\n\nAs they left the \u2018hearing,' \u201cChe was walking with his usual entourage when he noticed me,\u201d recalls father Arzuaga. \u201cHe sneered again and waved hello. Suddenly I saw Ariel\u2019s hysterical mother run in front of Che and throw herself on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cWoman,\u201d Guevara laughed at her. \u201cGo see that guy,\u201d and Che turned and pointed at me,\u201d writes father Arzuaga. \u201cPadre Javier is a professional at consoling people,\u201d Che chuckled. \u201cThen he looked over at me laughing. 'She\u2019s all yours, padre.'\"\n\n\u201cI walked over and helped the devastated women who had fallen on the ground sobbing uncontrollably,\u201d recalls the priest. \u201c'Put yourself in God\u2019s hands, Mam,' I prayed. 'Try and rise above this tragedy. God will help you learn to live without your son.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThat night (the mentally\u2013handicapped) Ariel Lima was still in a totally dazed condition as they tied him to the execution stake,\u201d wrote father Arzuaga, \u201ctotally unaware he was about to be murdered.\u201d\n\n\u201cFUEGO!\u201d And the volley shattered Ariel\u2019s little quivering body.\n\nNo doubt Che was watching and gloating from his window, as was his custom. Che's second-story office in La Cabana had a section of wall torn out so he could watch his darling firing-squads at work.\n\n\u201cMy nostrils dilate while savoring the acrid odor of gunpowder and blood. Crazy with fury I will stain my rifle red while slaughtering any surrendered enemy that falls in my hands! We must keep our hatred alive and fan it to paroxysm!\u201d\n\nAlas, the \u201cacrid odor of gunpowder and blood\u201d rarely reached Che Guevara\u2019s nostrils from actual combat. It always came from the close-range murder of bound, gagged or blindfolded men (and boys).\n\nRigoberto Hernandez was 17 when Che's soldiers dragged him from his cell in La Cabana, jerked his head back to gag him, and started dragging him to the stake. Little \"Rigo\" pleaded his innocence to the very bloody end. But his pleas were garbled and difficult to understand. His struggles while being gagged and bound to the stake were also awkward. The boy had been a janitor in a Havana high school and was mentally retarded. His single mother had pleaded his case with hysterical sobs. She had begged, beseeched and finally proven to his \"prosecutors\" that it was a case of mistaken identity. Her only son, a boy in such a condition, couldn't possibly have been \"a CIA agent planting bombs.\"\n\n\"FUEGO!\" and the firing squad volley shattered Rigo's little bent body as he moaned and struggled awkwardly against his bounds, blindfold and gag.\n\n\u201cCertainly we execute!\u201d boasted Che Guevara to the UN General Assembly Dec. 1964. \u201cAnd we will continue executing as long as it is necessary!\u201d Those executions (murders, actually; execution implies a judicial process) had reached about 16,000 by the time of Che Guevara\u2019s boast, the equivalent, given the relative populations, of over half a million executions in the U.S. (This figure comes from The Black Book of Communism, by the way, written by French scholars and published in English by Harvard University Press, neither outfit exactly a bastion of \u201cembittered Cuban exiles with an axe to grind.\u201d\n\nNeedless to add, the Smithsonian\u2014though billing itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest education and research complex\u201d\u2014somehow omitted all of the thoroughly-documented items above regarding their article subject-- in favor of Che Guevara with a baby bottle.", "description": "\u201cThe image that lasted from the trip (to Cuba) was .10/26/2019 2:41:07AM EST.", "authors": ["Humberto Fontova", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/65/719b3061-ff31-48f6-b2b6-9f4d3518d2ef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
