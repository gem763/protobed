Patriots (1): Next five opponents currently .500 or better. Not that New England isn't legit, but Buffalo only semi-decent team on its first-half schedule.\n\n2. Saints (2): Drew Brees returned with a vengeance. If Alvin Kamara can do same on other side of bye, is anyone going to stop them ... refs notwithstanding?\n\n3. 49ers (4): You can probably start chiseling Nick Bosa's name onto defensive rookie of the year trophy ... and maybe defensive player of the year trophy, too.\n\n4. Packers (3): What a weapon Aaron Jones is becoming. No Pack back in Super Bowl era had ever managed 159 receiving yards in a game until he did it Sunday.\n\n5. Vikings (5): DE Danielle Hunter turns 25 on Oct. 29. His 48 career sacks established record for most ever for player prior to his 25th birthday.\n\nNFL trade tracker:Latest news, player targets, team needs before deadline\n\n100 famous NFL players:Who played for teams you forgot about\n\n32 things we learned:From Week 8 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nWeek 8 winners, losers:Drew Brees shined in his return; Browns are total disappointment\n\n6. Ravens (6): Lamar Jackson is only 2018 first-round QB who hasn't faced New England (yet). The other four have combined for 30.0 passer rating.\n\n7. Colts (7): They're among league's most mystifying, vexing squads to analyze on week-to-week basis. Yet Indy should roll to AFC South crown. Right?\n\n8. Texans (9): Even in Jadeveon Clowney's absence, Whitney Mercilus putting together best year of his career. But can he maintain momentum without J.J. Watt?\n\n9. Chiefs (10): Crazy to think they've lost three straight at Arrowhead, yet, all things considered, you'd have to say they're in decent spot about now.\n\n10. Seahawks (12): Season-ending knee injury to C Justin Britt could be major blow to offensive line that has struggled quite a bit through the years.\n\n11. Rams (13): Todd Gurley is tracking toward 811 rushing yards (and 997 from scrimmage) projected over 16 games. But don't worry ... nothing's wrong with him.\n\n12. Lions (14): Matthew Stafford is quietly having best season of his career, largely because OC Darrell Bevell regularly allows him to cut deep ball loose.\n\n13. Cowboys (15): Did you know Brett Maher is the only kicker in NFL history with three field goals of at least 60 yards? He should come in handy.\n\n14. Eagles (17): Haven't had a 100-yard rusher in two years, a 35-game stretch that's league's longest. Yet Philly run game much better than its air attack.\n\n15. Panthers (8): If Kyle Allen honeymoon isn't over now, it's about to be if he struggles against next top-10 defense he'll face \u2014 Titans on Sunday.\n\n16. Bills (11): Whew. Now that legit Eagles in rear view, back to the tomato cans. Buffalo won't face team with winning record until Week 14 (Baltimore).\n\n17. Jaguars (20): Despite Leonard Fournette's resurgence, Jacksonville is only team in league that doesn't have multiple rushing touchowns this season.\n\n18. Steelers (19): Any questions now as to why they made move for Minkah Fitzpatrick? If you need answer, it's because Pittsburgh remains playoff-caliber.\n\n19. Titans (23): Small sample size, but Ryan Tannehill has 115.3 QB rating in his first two Tennessee starts ... but he could really use run game support.\n\n20. Raiders (16): At least their murderous travel schedule is over. Silver & Black will play next three in Oakland, where they last appeared Sept. 15.\n\n21. Chargers (24): When you can't crack 40 rushing yards four weeks in a row \u2014 and lose three times in that span \u2014 someone's gotta pay. Sorry, Coach Whiz.\n\n22. Bears (18): Welp, at least they remembered to run ball Sunday \u2014 to tune of season-high 162 yards. If only they'd run a bit more for Eddy Pineiro's sake.\n\n23. Buccaneers (21): After falling to Ryan Tannehill's Titans, Tampa Bay is 0-4 against quarterbacks who began 2019 season in backup roles.\n\n24. Browns (25): Talent was never a question with this team. Immaturity was ... and you expect unseasoned group to turn ball over on three straight snaps.\n\n25. Cardinals (26): You know your running back depth is in serious jeopardy when you have a losing record but have to trade for a guy (Kenyan Drake) who will be a free agent after eight more games.\n\n26. Giants (27): Daniel Jones has generated 13 of team's league-high 19 turnovers. Eli Manning's rookie year one of two when he didn't have at least 13 TOs.\n\n27. Broncos (22): Poor Joe Flacco, who endured neck injury while venting his spleen. At least QB-challenged team gets to see Brandon Allen and, likely, Drew Lock soon enough.\n\n28. Falcons (29): As likable as Dan Quinn is, when he's overseeing a defense that has generated a league-low seven sacks, serious questions are inevitable.\n\n29. Jets (28): Not sure why it took so long to trade Leonard Williams given poor scheme fit. Also not sure why they don't throw to Ryan Griffin every play.\n\n30. Redskins (30): You've got to wonder if Jay Gruden is snickering every time obviously not-ready-for-prime-time Dwayne Haskins is pressed into service.\n\n31. Bengals (31): Congratulations, Andy Dalton, you're the first quarterback to engineer both an 8-0 start and suffer through 0-8 stretch to start a season.\n\n32. Dolphins (32): They nearly enjoyed a full half of prosperity Monday night in Pittsburgh. Then there was a 53-man reversion to 0-16 form.\n\n(Previous ranking in parentheses)\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
