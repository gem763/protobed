That stalled-out boundary will serve as the focal point for a surface low to develop along, increasing cloud cover and the chance of showers for the later half of the weekend.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Remaining mostly cloudy with just a slight chance of a spot shower or two, especially in the early evening. On the cool side with lows in the upper 40s to low 50s under a light northeast wind at 5-10 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Sunday): A rather cloudy and sometimes wet Sunday is on tap. Most of the day should be dry, with just overcast skies to deal with. I do expect some scattered showers to develop at some point in the day, with highs leveling out in the mid-60s. Scattered showers persist through the evening hours, with mostly cloudy skies overnight and temperatures in the low to mid-50s.\n\nSee Ian Livingston\u2019s forecast through next week.
