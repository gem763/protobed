But for this realignment to stick over the longer term, new recruits must find more common ground with their newfound political friends than simply their views on the European Union.\n\nIn Westminster, MPs for the U.K.'s pro-EU, centrist party are in buoyant mood. Since the last election in 2017, they have swelled their parliamentary ranks from 12 to 17 MPs as disillusioned former opponents backed their unapologetic anti-Brexit pitch.\n\nFor all the cheers and jubilant press releases, party chiefs must now navigate the delicate task of integration while trying not to alienate loyal party members who often harbor deep-seated tribal animosity toward recent converts. Get this wrong and the boost in parliament could quickly turn sour.\n\nJo Swinson, the Lib Dems' young new leader, has now pledged to revoke Article 50 \u2014 the formal notice to the EU of the U.K.'s intention to leave the bloc \u2014 if her party wins a majority.\n\nIn an effort to ease such problems, the Lib Dem leadership is making newcomers earn their stripes. They have made no promises defectors can be candidates for the party at the next election and the new MPs are being schooled in its complex policy-making rules ahead of the party's annual conference, which begins in Bournemouth this weekend.\n\nIn truth, the Lib Dem's modest representation in the House of Commons means there is limited scope for cushy offers of plum jobs that might be possible for either of the two main parties. \"[My defection to the Lib Dems] wasn't a career move,\" former Tory Philip Lee, who is the party's newest recruit said. \"I didn't have any promises of anything.\"\n\n\"I think humility is very important, and I am not going to seek to impose myself or to run before I can walk,\" Luciana Berger, a former Labour MP who joined the party earlier this month told POLITICO.\n\nHome for Remainers\n\nThe perfect storm of the referendum vote to leave the European Union and its division of the two main parties, along with Labour's anti-Semitism scandal, has prompted closer ties and fostered cross-party working in ways that were rare in Britain's two-party system pre-2016.\n\nThe party has also been the beneficiary of a failed effort to create a new pro-European political party \u2014 Change UK, which barely registered in the polls during May's European elections \u2014 leaving the Liberal Democrats alone on the Remain side of the Brexit debate.\n\nThis has helped swell the party's membership numbers and electoral support, which had been badly damaged after the party entered into a five-year coalition with the Conservatives in 2010.\n\nJo Swinson, the Lib Dems' young new leader, has now pledged to revoke Article 50 \u2014 the formal notice to the EU of the U.K.'s intention to leave the bloc \u2014 if her party wins a majority, in a further pitch to Remain supporters.\n\nThere were elated scenes in the House of Commons after the party's most recent recruit, former Tory MP Phillip Lee, walked across the floor to join the Liberal Democrats. The attention-grabbing stunt deprived Prime Minister Boris Johnson of his one-vote majority even as he was making a statement to MPs from the dispatch box.\n\nOne of us?\n\nBut for all the party's \"love-bombing\" of its new MPs, as Berger put it, the leadership is anxious not to alienate existing members. In particular it does not want to rock the boat in seats where a defecting MP may run into competition with long-serving candidates for selection to contest a seat.\n\nDefectors do not always live happily in their new political home, as the Lib Dems have found previously.\n\nHelen Thompson, the existing Liberal Democrat candidate in pro-Remain Streatham, the south London seat where defector Chuka Umunna was elected as the Labour MP in 2017, said the party had been \"good at keeping us informed and listening to our views and trying to understand how it would go down with local activists.\"\n\nUmunna was not always a friend of the Liberal Democrats. In 2017, he called the party the \"enablers\" of Tory austerity. \"Working people will not forget or forgive the damage they did in government,\" he once said, one of many phrases now regularly quoted back at him.\n\nThompson acknowledged that for longer term activists \"it has been a bit of an adjustment to think of him as one of us,\" but for many new members who joined the party recently \"pretty much everybody sees it as a huge win for us really to have him join.\"\n\n\"On Brexit he has had the same views as us, pretty much since after the referendum,\" she said.\n\nUmunna will not now stand in his old Streatham constituency and will instead try to take the flagship Tory seat of The Cities of London & Westminster.\n\nThe Lib Dems will hope that opening their doors to outsiders from other parties will prove the key to shifting the Brexit debate.\n\nBerger said she was waiting to be formally chosen as a candidate by the local party, and would have to pass a test before being selected.\n\nBeyond Brexit\n\nWhile the new MPs are united with leader Jo Swinson in their opposition to Brexit, skeptics question if they share much more beyond that.\n\nLee says joining any political party is a \"compromise\" and that Brexit was the \"major precipitant\" in his decision to cross the floor, but points to climate change and health as other areas where he agrees with his new colleagues.\n\nHowever, his defection prompted a number of LGBT Liberal Democrat members to announce they were leaving the party because of his views on gay rights and HIV-positive migrants.\n\nLee abstained in a 2013 House of Commons vote on same-sex marriage and tried to amend the Immigration Bill in 2014 to make immigrants demonstrate they are clear of HIV and Hepatitis B before entering the U.K.\n\nBerger says she is joining a social democratic party. \"That which led me to join the Labour Party \u2014 around equality for all, anti-racism against all, social justice \u2014 are Liberal Democrat party values too,\" she said.\n\nShe thinks she has a \"lot to contribute in various areas,\" particularly in public health, mental health and climate change, all portfolios she held while in senior positions for the Labour party.\n\nBerger and former Tory MP Sarah Wollaston were put through a crash course in the complex process of Liberal Democrat policy making on Tuesday but Berger insists she won't be \"jumping the gun.\"\n\nAnd before crossing the political divide she also had an extensive interview with the Lib Dem chief whip. \"It was a proper discussion, it wasn't a cursory check. Lots of policy [was discussed],\" she said.\n\nTrouble ahead\n\nDefectors do not always live happily in their new political home, as the Lib Dems have found previously. They scored a publicity victory ahead of the 2017 general election when Boris Johnson's sister Rachel joined the party from the Conservatives, saying she would consider standing for parliament for her new political family.\n\nBut nearly two years later she jumped ship again, this time to the new pro-EU party, Change UK, who she represented in the last European election.\n\nThe UK Independence Party has also had trouble hanging on to new recruits. Douglas Carswell, who left the Tories to join the anti-EU party under Nigel Farage, left the party three years later after a string of very public disagreements with the leadership.\n\nGawain Towler, then Farage's spokesman and now head of communications at the Brexit Party, said that despite Carswell being \"a nightmare at times\" his defection was a strategic win for UKIP.\n\n\u201cIt was worth it because it was that \u2014 our Euro results, and the fact that we had those two defections \u2014 that forced Cameron\u2019s hand to give us the referendum in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Lib Dems will hope that opening their doors to outsiders from other parties will prove the key to shifting the Brexit debate in the other direction.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
