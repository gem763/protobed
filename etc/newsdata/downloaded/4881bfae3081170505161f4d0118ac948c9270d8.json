The event has waited 29 years for this, its finest conclusion. If women\u2019s golf, especially in Europe, cannot build upon such theatre then there really is no hope.\n\nIn the kind of denouement script writers lie awake conjuring up, even the key protagonist was as if hand picked. There was one putt left in the 16th meeting of Europe and the United States. Suzann Pettersen, subject to epic ridicule after a controversial incident during her last participation in this duel, four years ago, had an eight-footer to claim back the cup.\n\nSuzann Pettersen forced out of first Solheim Cup morning by illness Read more\n\nPettersen, 635th in the world after a career break to start a family, versus Marina Alex was the only match still in play. As word spread that Europe, written off Europe, underdog Europe, suddenly had a chance of landing a sucker punch on the United States a sporting world turned its attention as one. The Norwegian exploded with joy as the ball reached the bottom of the cup.\n\nPettersen was soon joined by euphoric teammates, who had been privately resigned to defeat only 40 minutes earlier. Amid that debacle in Germany in 2015, Pettersen spent the aftermath crying in a locked hotel room. To suggest this was an altogether different scene barely paints an appropriate picture. This was the ultimate redemption. It was followed, even more amazingly, by her retirement.\n\n\u201cThis is it; professionally, I\u2019m done,\u201d said the 38-year-old. \u201cThis is perfect closure. That\u2019s it, I\u2019m done. This is a good end to a great career.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Pettersen sticks to her plan once emotion subsides but it seems safe to assume that her Solheim Cup run will end at nine. And on the ultimate high.\n\nIn maintaining a mood of farewell, Juli Inkster confirmed she will call time on US captaincy duties after three stints.\n\nEurope 14\u00bd, US 13\u00bd. A tie would have been sufficient for the US to retain the trophy. Gleneagles staged a gargantuan tussle. From a starting position of 8-8, common consensus was that the greater strength in depth of Inkster\u2019s side would prevail. Instead, Catriona Matthew \u2013 so unheralded in British sporting context \u2013 presided over a victory that reverberated way beyond Perthshire.\n\n\u201cI always had faith in Suzann,\u201d said Matthew. \u201cIt was just unbelievable. There has never been a better moment.\u201d\n\nIf focus understandably centred on Pettersen, the heroics of Bronte Law also require appreciation. The Englishwoman won three of her last four holes against Ally McDonald to seal a 2&1 victory. This meant Pettersen\u2019s match mattered.\n\nLaw had been one down after 10. At that juncture, a tie \u2013 or US victory \u2013 looked inevitable. Brittany Altomare thumped Jodi Ewart Shadoff 5&4 and both Korda sisters, Nelly and Jessica, added to the US tally. As Angel Yin defeated Azahara Mu\u00f1oz and Lizette Salas took down Anne van Dam by a hole, the European outlook was grim.\n\nBrian Barnes, golfer who beat Jack Nicklaus twice in one day, dies aged 74 Read more\n\nWith the outcome still in the balance, Charley Hull made an awful mess of the 18th when 1up on Megan Khang. This marked the second time Hull had let a winning position slip on the last; such margins can, in normal circumstances, determine events such as this. \u201cI feel pretty happy,\u201d said Hull. \u201cI think I was one down with about five or six to play, so to halve the match is not too bad.\u201d This won\u2019t be a candidate for analysis of the year. Thankfully, alas, it barely mattered.\n\nCarlota Ciganda had fuelled hopes of an unlikely European win with a 1up success over Danielle Kang in game one. Georgia Hall, outstanding once again in the Solheim Cup, ensured four wins from as many games as Lexi Thompson was seen off 2&1. In Thompson\u2019s defence, she had been battling a back problem which had placed her singles appearance in doubt.\n\nAnna Nordqvist, out of sorts over the first two days, recovered brilliantly to see off Morgan Pressel 4&3. C\u00e9line Boutier, like Pettersen a Matthew wildcard pick, was a 2&1 victor over Annie Park.\n\nSuch details are, of course, intrinsically linked to the outcome. Yet the defining moment dwarfed all before it and, inevitably, so much that will follow. In this age, where so many final acts are lazily classed among the greatest ever, this was a genuine jaw-dropper.
