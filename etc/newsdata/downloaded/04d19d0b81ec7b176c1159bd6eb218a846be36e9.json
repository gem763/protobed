A working \"idea sheet\" mimics the Toomey-Manchin bill, which is said to close the so-called \"gun show loophole.\"\n\nThe proposal would require \"all advertised commercial sales, including sales at gun shows,\" to go through a background check at a Federal Firearms Licensee or a newly-created group of licensed transfer agents.\n\nFrom the Caller:\n\nOne source familiar with the meetings said that Barr pitched the legislation by warning that a lack of action could electrify the Democratic base prior to the 2020 election. Barr also did not consider the background check legislation a gun control measure, instead painting it as a tool to assist law enforcement in cracking down on gun smugglers, the source explained. Another person familiar described the efforts to get Republicans on board as superficial, noting that there was no draft text or other follow-up action promised to them after the meeting.\n\nSenate Republican Whip John Thune (R-SD) said Trump will have to decide what he's okay with.\n\n\u201cThere are some ideas floating around that different members of the administration are coming up with and at this point it\u2019s probably too early to say\u201d if Republicans will support it. \u201cOur members are going to be very \u2014 proceed with caution \u2014 very skeptical of some of the ideas that have been put out there in the past, but I think they\u2019re willing to listen.\"\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told The Hill he has yet to see the proposal \"but I talked to [Attorney General William] Barr yesterday. He\u2019s going around talking to people. If he\u2019s good with it, I\u2019m good with it.\"\n\nAs of now, President Donald Trump has yet to signal support for the bill.\n\n\u201cThe President has not signed off on anything yet but has been clear he wants meaningful solutions that actually protect the American people and could potentially prevent these tragedies from ever happening again,\" Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, told POLITICO. \u201cThat is not a White House document, and any suggestion to contrary is completely false.\u201d\n\nHere's a copy of the memo:", "description": "Hmm..09/18/2019 19:15:58PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/254/901d3824-31cb-48c6-b116-44a5d7998a0f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
