He was expecting an \"active\" couple of high-volume days, through Columbus Day on Monday.\n\nHomeowners have been waking up to the fact that they might save money by refinancing, even if they took out their current mortgage just last year. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates have seen a stunning decline and are down almost 1.5 percentage points from where they were at this time in 2018.\n\nYou think that's impressive? There's room for rates to fall even further, according to a new report.\n\nA perfect time to borrow\n\nrawmn / Shutterstock\n\nRates on home loans are much lower than they were last year at this time\n\nMore\n\nThe current average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 3.57%, down from 3.65% a week earlier, says mortgage giant Freddie Mac.\n\nThe really striking comparison is to last year at this time, when the benchmark mortgage rate was averaging nearly 5%. (To be exact, 4.9%.)\n\nTake a look at today's best mortgage rates where you live.\n\nRates on 15-year mortgages \u2014 which are popular among homeowners who refi \u2014 have fallen to an average 3.05%, from 3.14% the previous week. A year ago, those rates were averaging 4.29%, Freddie Mac says.\n\nIt's an excellent time to do a cash-out refi, Rosenbaum says, \"to pay off existing debt by cashing out of the equity many homeowners have built. There are many opportunities and options available.\"\n\nOn 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages \u2014 which are level for five years and then can \"adjust\" up or down each year \u2014 the current average initial rate is 3.35%. That's down from 3.38% in early October and much lower than the 4.07% borrowers were charged a year ago.\n\nCalculate the kind of monthly payment you might expect from the current mortgage rates.\n\nReport: Rates should be even lower\n\nAntonio Guillem / Shutterstock\n\nSome customers are disappointed by today's mortgage rates.\n\nMore\n\nMortgage rates may be at eye-poppingly low levels, but they could be lower still, reports The Wall Street Journal.\n\nRates on home loans tend to track the interest on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes. Lately, those bond yields have been falling faster than mortgage rates \u2014 in fact, the spread between the two is the widest in over seven years.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Plus, a new report sees room for rates to fall even more.", "authors": ["Doug Whiteman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MVA4BfwUZzJELiN2qG1Smg--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/a18a1d02ddc9081e51cde2ab00729a71", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
