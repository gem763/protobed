Boris Johnson is not fit to be Prime Minister. And the country deserves a better choice than either of those two.\u201d\n\nJo Swinson says there are no circumstances under which she could back a Jeremy Corbyn government adding that he is \"not fit to be Prime Minister\".\n\n\n\nGet live updates on #Ridge here: https://t.co/gkVGqz18Dg pic.twitter.com/ql5pVftly6 \u2014 Ridge on Sunday (@RidgeOnSunday) October 13, 2019\n\nEarlier in the conversation, Ms Swinson said she would not back Mr Corbyn despite him being leader of the Opposition as he does not have the numbers, even discounting whether the Liberal Democrats would support him or not.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson says Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson are not fit to be PM (PA)\n\nShe said: \u201c\u201dWell he doesn\u2019t have the numbers. If you add up the numbers even without the Liberal Democrats he\u2019s far short of it.\n\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s remember why he is far short, part of that is because there are people who were Labour MPs who have left the Labour party because their failure to deal with anti-Semitism.\n\n\u201cWe are not talking about something that is irrelevant or a minor problem about something, we are talking about the fundamental value of whether people are treated with equality.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s very good reasons people have for saying why they wouldn\u2019t back Jeremy Corbyn and I think in those circumstances we need to find a solution that works, and I think there\u2019s a wide range of people who could lead such a government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve put forward Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman \u2013 but if you look at others who have been long respected MPs there\u2019s people like Margaret Beckett.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of people who are a little bit above party politics who would step in.\u201d\n\nMs Swinson added that ultimately, despite saying that Labour back a second referendum, Mr Corbyn is somebody who wants to deliver Brexit.\n\nShe said: \u201cThey say that they\u2019re backing that but let\u2019s look at their actions.\n\n\u201cI mean Jeremy Corbyn was calling for Article 50 to be triggered the day after the referendum, he\u2019s somebody who has said he wants to deliver a Brexit.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you put a red rosette on it or a blue rosette on it, Brexit is still going to be bad for our country.\n\nMs Swinson concluded that she believes \u201cit is entirely possible\u201d that the Liberal Democrats could secure a majority at the next election, and said she is \u201chopeful\u201d for more defections.\n\nShe said: \u201cWell I think it\u2019s entirely possible. We are at a very volatile time in our politics and as I say, there are people who have left the Labour party, people who have left the Conservative party as MPs and indeed as members and as voters.\n\nWe beat both the Labour and Conservative parties at the European elections.\u201d\n\nMs Swinson added that \u201cthese are volatile times\u201d and that she expects more MPs to follow in the steps of former Conservative MP Heidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire) and defect to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m always hopeful. I think there are a lot of MPs who are unhappy in their current parties and of course it is a very personal decision, a personal journey for people to make.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go into the details of private conversations, you\u2019ll understand that, but I\u2019d certainly say I\u2019m still having conversations and indeed people in the Labour party are very unhappy too not just for the reasons I mentioned about Corbyn\u2019s inability to tackle anti-Semitism, but also their failure on Brexit, the biggest issue of the day where the leader of the Opposition didn\u2019t stand up for the national interest and say that we should stop Brexit.\u201d", "description": "Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson told Ridge on Sunday on Sky News that Mr Corbyn is", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/12/wire-19652560-1570965227-751_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
