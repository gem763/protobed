Journalists should refuse to be played | Peter Geoghegan", "language": "en", "text": "The prime minister\u2019s bonhomie with Leo Varadkar after their talks in the Wirral last Thursday took many by surprise. It must have come as a particular shock to readers of the Times, who just 24 hours earlier had been told that the taoiseach had \u201creneged on a secret deal with Boris Johnson to open the way to a Brexit compromise\u201d. And the source of this story? An unnamed Downing Street insider.\n\nIt\u2019s been quite a run for \u201cNo 10 source\u201d. In barely a week, the increasingly ubiquitous attribution was behind reports that the normally stolid Angela Merkel had accused Johnson of trying to play a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d, and the news that European states seeking to stymie the prime minister\u2019s Brexit proposals would go to the back of the \u201cqueue\u201d for future trade deals.\n\nThe more journalists report unsourced claims, the less government will engage on the record\n\nWhat will No 10 source reveal next? That \u201cCorbyn has promised to sell Northern Ireland to Brussels\u201d? That Johnson is \u201cthe best prime minister ever\u201d?\n\nThis is not how anonymous sourcing is supposed to operate. Whistleblowers and leaks are a vital part of journalism. Without them we would know far less about how government and powerful organisations work. Richard Nixon would have seen out two terms as US president. The law firm Mossack Fonseca would still be hiding the super rich\u2019s secrets in Panamanian bank accounts.\n\nBut when the government is able to use the convention of blind quotes to regularly set the news agenda, something has gone wrong.\n\nThe growing reliance on anonymous briefings allows Downing Street to push narratives without having to take responsibility for them. Rasmus Nielsen, director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, has said that British journalists are being \u201cplayed like an instrument\u201d when they publish stories based on government leaks and anonymous sources. There is also no way for proper public scrutiny to be placed on such a source.\n\nThe more journalists report unsourced claims, the less the government will engage on the record. Why put up a minister up for a potentially combative live interview when, as happened last week, BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One programme reads out on-air a lengthy text sent from an anonymous No 10 source to a magazine journalist? The \u201cleak\u201d, originally sent to the Spectator, set up the prime minister as the custodian of the supposed will of the people against a pernicious European Union. Not exactly Deep Throat \u2013 more like Classic Dom.\n\nDominic Cummings arrived in Downing Street as Boris Johnson\u2019s special adviser, promising zero tolerance on leakers. Now many believe he has become the (very) thinly veiled source of a series of government announcements by anonymous briefing \u2013 this both gives Johnson plausible deniability when the kites being flown hit overhead wires, and adds to the mythology of Cummings as the \u00e9minence grise playing multi-dimensional chess.\n\nGovernment spinning stories is hardly new. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s press secretary, Bernard Ingham, frequently briefed the media to settle internal party scores. Alastair Campbell was so successful at controlling the press that he became immortalised in The Thick of It.\n\nBut, as with everything else, the internet has changed the rules of the game. Many of the biggest news mornings since Johnson took office have begun not with a set-piece interview \u2013 as was long the case \u2013 but with a tweet thread from a prominent journalist setting out the government\u2019s key talking points for the day. There is no space for rebuttal. By the time scrutiny arrives, hours or even days later, the message is already out.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson\u2019s special adviser Dominic Cummings.

They can speak directly to their intended audiences through social media, confident that sympathetic titles and reporters will rush to repackage their statements \u2013 and if they don\u2019t, there won\u2019t be any more \u201cexclusive\u201d stories heading their way.\n\nIt\u2019s a textbook example of what American linguist George Lakoff calling \u201cframing the narrative\u201d. What journalists are talking about matters more than whether it is true or false.\n\nDonald Trump is the master of narrative framing \u2013 though he doesn\u2019t need anonymous briefings to do it. From \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d to his comments about the Kurds not fighting in Normandy, the US president has long shown how to use the \u201che said, she said\u201d conventions of reporting to spread disinformation. Even debunking false or inaccurate claims gives misinformation more oxygen, paradoxically lending it credibility.\n\nThis poses a huge challenge for journalism. The New York Times was heavily criticised recently for a front-page headline that declared \u201cTrump Urges Unity vs Racism\u201d after a spate of racially motivated attacks that the president was widely accused of having stoked with his inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nThere are plenty of signs that Johnson has read Trump\u2019s script. The anguished howls from anti-Brexit campaigners when he erroneously blamed \u201cBrussels bureaucrats\u201d for British kippers being transported on \u201cice pillows\u201d only served to amplify the core anti-EU message.\n\nDowning Street\u2019s tough-talking \u2018memo\u2019 is part of a dangerous game | Gaby Hinsliff Read more\n\nThe traditional standard of objectivity in journalism is often parsed as \u201creporting what everyone says without fear or favour\u201d. But what if you are reporting something that is misinformation, or even a flat-out lie? And beyond the more blatant misdirections of Trump \u2013 and Johnson \u2013 it is even harder to judge this when readers aren\u2019t even told the exact source of information.\n\nBrexit has revealed the limits of Westminster lobby journalism and its susceptibility to narrative framing. Fearful that audiences will switch off in the digital age, journalists have often treated Britain\u2019s departure from the EU more like a melodrama populated by colourful characters than an intricate, complicated policy story. In this febrile atmosphere, journalists have been drawn into reporting leaks without interrogating the substance behind the story.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution to all this? Being more honest with audiences about where stories come would be a start \u2013 and providing far more context about the potential motives of their source. Journalists could be far more selective in reporting what is said inside government when it doesn\u2019t come with an official attribution.\n\nTrust in journalism has been badly shaken over the last decade. Just adding \u201cgovernment source\u201d at the end of the first paragraph is not enough. Readers are not stupid. We shouldn\u2019t act as if they are.\n\n\u2022 Peter Geoghegan is investigations editor at openDemocracyUK", "description": "When the government is able to use blind quotes to regularly set the news agenda, something is wrong, says Peter Geoghegan, investigations editor at openDemocracyUK", "authors": ["Peter Geoghegan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/200c4af2f15896ec561dd93640a5b78726959b1c/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b62a22caf31fd63897a9bafbec853af8", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
