But, among the pretty plaits and colourful eye make-up, another trend was brewing.\n\nThe rise of dedicated skincare backstage.\n\n\n\nSaid to be just as (if not more) important than make-up for achieving every model's glowing skin on the catwalk, skincare has, until now, been overlooked when discussing the latest beauty trends from the shows.\n\nIn fact, it's only in the past few seasons that skincare brands have even been involved in fashion week shows at all.\n\n\"When I first started working backstage at the shows, there was only one manicurist for 30 models and no real skin prep before make-up whatsoever,\" says the celebrity facialist Nichola Joss, who works with clients including the Duchess of Sussex. \"Now, there's increased awareness of the importance of skincare, especially because the better the skin, the better the make-up.\"\n\n\n\nThis awareness for a large part, according to Joss, is to due to the emergence of the 'no make-up' make-up trend, which requires models to walk the runways with healthy-looking skin that looks naturally perfect, not concealed.\n\nThat's easier said than done, though, when models are jetting in from all over the world and are likely to be walking in more than one show each day - a recipe for breakouts and less-than-glowing complexions.\n\nThe solution: skin experts tasked backstage to provide fast yet effective skincare treatments, including most frequently the use of sheet masks and facial massage.\n\nWe earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article\n\nSheet masks\n\n\"I was backstage with 111Skin this season and the demand for quick but effective skin preparation is only growing,\" says Joss. \"Face masks can give you the immediate results you need, especially when it comes to getting rid of puffiness and hydrating the skin.\"\n\n\"Every model wants to have a mask put on because it's a moment of calm from being pushed and pulled in all directions,\" Joss continues. \"Make-up artists like them too because they provide a good base for make-up, helping it glide on flawlessly.\"\n\nStep one: Cleanse the skin to achieve a clean base.\n\nStep two: Apply the mask and leave it on for as little for five minutes to see good results. For use at home, why not apply one for 20 minutes while relaxing in the bath.\n\n\"My go-to this season were 111Skin's Facial Treatment Masks (made from biocellulose) and the under-eye masks,\" reveals Joss. \"They fit better than paper ones and don't drip. That means they could even be worn when the models are having their hair done.\"\n\nFacial massage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacial massage was utilised backstage at the shows for its ability to encourage blood circulation (giving models that 'lit-from-within' glow) and to drain the face of puffiness.\n\nAt Emilia Wickstead, for example, Oskia skincare was used to achieve the models' enviably \"illuminated and fresh-faced skin\", using a combination of massage techniques and glow-boosting skincare such as the brand's vitamin C-rich Super-C Beauty Capsules. For Victoria Beckham, Caudalie's Beauty Elixir, was used to similar effect.\n\nStep one: Massage a cleansing gel into the skin to ensure a deep clean.\n\nStep two: Then, apply your active skincare and use a jade Gua Sha to cool, de-puff and further massage the products into the skin.\n\n\"I recommend using a facial oil or balm when massaging the skin, such as those in the Decl\u00e9or range\", says Joss, who is also famous for her massage technique. \"Stay away from dry oils, though, that can tug on the skin, causing redness and irritation, and take your time. A massage and good skin prep is finished once all of the product is absorbed.\"\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "It's how models always have glowing skin, even without make-up", "authors": ["Becki Murray"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zEOPB5hYOBXsQWl7UP6GjQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_111/59899f55e7e2c8e4e40d37fabedc8d1a", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
