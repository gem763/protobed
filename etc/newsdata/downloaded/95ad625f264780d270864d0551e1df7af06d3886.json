The nursery\u2019s offerings are available at Monticello, online and at three open houses at the farm. The last one of the year will be held on Saturday.\n\nAD\n\nI once returned from Monticello with seed of his snail flower, a beguiling tender woody vine with white and violet shell-like blooms of intense fragrance. I kept it going for a few years by wintering it in the basement, and then one spring it didn\u2019t wake up. In time along my gardening journey I forgot all about it. Back at Tufton Farm the other day, I was happy to see the snail flower \u2014 this time in pots \u2014 is still a staple of the nursery.\n\nBut I was there for another reason. This year, Tufton Farm has begun a fresh, expanded role, as a prototype of sustainable agriculture for our time and, eventually, a tourist destination where families can come for events, tours and the simple pleasures of being in the countryside.\n\nAD\n\nRatchen\u2019s field of 39 vegetable varieties is one of the first signs of the farm\u2019s new incarnation, along with an apiary of 25 colorful beehives. By my estimate, that\u2019s at least a million pollinating honeybees.\n\nAD\n\nKeith Nevison, farm and nursery manager, outlines plans for doubling the vegetable production and adding a 15-acre cider apple orchard, a vineyard, a hopyard, fields for cut flowers and herbs and the rotational grazing of cattle in woodland. (The farm is also already used for pasturing a herd of black angus.)\n\nOne impetus for this is to supply fresh, local and organically grown food to customers at Farm Table, the cafe at Monticello where many of the 400,000 annual visitors gravitate after seeing Jefferson\u2019s Palladian mansion and 1,000-foot-long vegetable terrace along with the more woeful elements of a plantation built on slave labor. Alice Waters, the matriarch of America\u2019s farm-to-table movement, visited occasionally and has written that \u201cThomas Jefferson has long been a personal hero of mine.\u201d But when Waters was there in 2011, she was aghast at the quality of the food and sugary sodas in the cafe, and she let her displeasure be known. She returned last month to survey the improvements during Monticello\u2019s annual Heritage Harvest Festival.\n\nAD\n\nThe cafe and its diners are the obvious first beneficiary of the farm, but Nevison seems most energized by its greater role. \u201cWe are mostly interested in the challenges facing American agriculture, so the model we want to support is one of diversity, experimentation, success for small and medium-sized producers,\u201d he says.\n\nAD\n\nAs for Jefferson, \u201cwe are really thinking about what kind of farmer he would be nowadays,\u201d Nevison says.\n\nThe gardens and orchards at Monticello still focus on varieties Jefferson grew using techniques in play two centuries ago. Tufton Farm\u2019s role is not so constrained. For example, it\u2019s unlikely Nevison will turn to cider apple varieties used in early 19th-century Virginia. \u201cWe know some of these types are in\u00adcred\u00adibly disease-prone. We know we have got to try newer types,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe experimental nature of the farm is entirely aligned with Jefferson\u2019s trials at Monticello. He was famously curious, empirical and plagued by failures. But his signal achievement was in breaking the colonial mold of gardens based on cool-season European vegetables and embracing warm-season edibles from the Americas and Africa. These \u201coddities\u201d included tomatoes, peppers, okra, squash, eggplant and lima beans \u2014 now about as mainstream as a veggie plot gets in Virginia. \u201cIn the same way that Jefferson\u2019s Declaration of Independence defined a legacy of democracy and liberty, the Monticello garden broke with European tradition,\u201d writes Peter Hatch in his 2012 book, \u201cA Rich Spot of Earth.\u201d Hatch, the retired longtime director of gardens and grounds at Monticello, makes an eloquent case for Jefferson as, in his words, the first foodie.\n\nAD\n\nIn some respects, Jefferson seems an odd exemplar. His conspicuous failures included repeated attempts at raising wine grapes. When he died in 1826, he left his heirs with so much debt they had to sell Monticello.\n\nThis insolvency is attributed to more than the expenses of his large-scale gardening and farming ambitions. He inherited debt, and he in turn was owed money that went unpaid. But he also lived beyond his means, not least in the stocking of his wine cellar.\n\nAD\n\nThis doesn\u2019t detract from his green-fingered zeal or the validity of some of his gardening practices.\n\n\u201cHe was definitely aware that good gardening starts from the ground up,\u201d said Peggy Cornett, Monticello\u2019s curator of plants.\n\nNevison, 36, sees Tufton Farm becoming a model for young people who want to learn to farm in a way that will provide a secure livelihood. \u201cI think about climate change and threats to our own food security, and I think we can promote better stewardship and farming practices,\u201d Nevison said.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition, he wants it to be a place people of his generation will visit to plug into the countryside and nature. \u201cYoung folks need to know where their food comes from, to connect to the landscape that inspires,\u201d he says. \u201cA landscape that is vibrant with wildlife and striving for an aesthetic approach as well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTip of the Week\n\nCooler weather alone will not reverse weeks of extreme dryness. Continue to water trees and shrubs stressed from the lack of rain. Avoid frequent, light waterings in favor of occasional deep soaks. Plants need one to two inches of water weekly. Trees should receive 25 gallons of water.\n\n\u2014 Adrian Higgins\n\nMore from Lifestyle:\n\nAD", "description": "An ambitious expansion project could make Virginia\u2019s Tufton Farm a tourist destination.", "authors": ["Adrian Higgins", "Gardening Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JKgrJLf1WJNFKZHatxraEwoArEo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QT764THG24I6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
