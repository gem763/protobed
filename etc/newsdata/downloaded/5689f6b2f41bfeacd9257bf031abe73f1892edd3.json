And while we\u2019re mourning the loss of the doll\u2019s signature natural features, it\u2019s worth noting that the toy has always acted as a gauge for whatever the most aspirational beauty standards of the day happen to be. The \u201960s-era Barbie was a swishy blond that appeared to be missing ribs; in the \u201990s, she was a leggy, blue-eyed pageant queen. In 2016, Time ran a cover story about Mattel\u2019s big, brave, market-driven decision to start selling Barbie Dolls with different body types (petite, tall, and curvy).\n\nSo, that these latest Barbies are all suffering from a bad case of Instagram Face \u2014 marked by filled lips, teeny noses, and high cheeks \u2014 makes sense. A wave of Instagram-friendly clinics like Alchemy 43, Kate Somerville, and Skin Laundry have popularized medical beauty treatments (services like Botox, fillers, lip injections, and laser treatments) for the under-30 crowd. And Allergen, the maker of Botox and dermal filler Juv\u00e9derm, has been targeting the 20-something market for some time now. According to the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\u2019s 2018 survey, the number of Botox treatments among 22- to 37-year-olds has risen 22 percent since 2013.\n\nMattel has been dogged about reflecting problematic, unrealistic beauty standards for the half a century it\u2019s been making kid\u2019s toys. Why stop innovating now?", "description": "RIP to Barbie\u2019s signature natural look.
