But the most important, and probably vaguest, announcement ahead of the franchise\u2019s next film release came from J.J. Abrams and his team in April: the official title of Star Wars: Episode IX \u2014 are you ready? \u2014 is The Rise of Skywalker. It\u2019s a weird choice, considering The Last Jedi seemed liked the last we\u2019d see of Luke Skywalker (you know, the last Jedi), his sister Leia can\u2019t have that pivotal of a role given that the series is working with material filmed before Carrie Fisher\u2019s death, and her son Kylo Ren has disavowed the family business of being good by being very evil. How, exactly, could a Skywalker rise from that? What does this mean for Rey? Is J.J. over-promising on some big mystery box again? We\u2019re not entirely sure, but now that Disney has released its final trailer for the Dec. 20 movie, we are here to speculate. Behold, some theories that could explain the title:\n\nRey is a Skywalker\n\nWe\u2019d say \u201cOh, come on, they\u2019d never do something this obvious after all the energy they spent telling us this wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d but we\u2019re talking about J.J. Abrams, co-creator of Lost, a show whose stewards kept telling us there was no way the big reveal would be that the characters were in purgatory, then proceeded to do exactly that in the finale. (Jesus, we really need to get over that.) So it\u2019s not impossible to imagine sneaky ol\u2019 J.J. completely obliterating The Last Jedi auteur Rian Johnson\u2019s whole \u201cRey\u2019s parents are a nonentity\u201d thing and revealing that Luke was her father or her uncle or some goddamn thing. But, again, that would be a ridiculously cheap and dishonest twist, so maybe the powers that be aren\u2019t complete idiots and won\u2019t make us watch that.\n\nRey is a Skywalker \u2026 ish\n\nHey, remember clones? Dudes with Kiwi accents, looked real good in block colors? Well, what if \u2026 what if \u2026 Rey turns out to have been created with the same kind of whiz-bang person-replicating technology? We could see a big reveal that, like, the Emperor somehow had Luke or Leia cloned and the result was Jakku\u2019s finest, now ripe for an attempt at dark-side seduction. In the erstwhile canonical Star Wars Expanded Universe, clones\u2019 names were the same as their originals\u2019, except with an extra vowel: Luke\u2019s clone was \u201cLuuke,\u201d for example, and no, we\u2019re not making that up; go yell at Timothy Zahn if it makes you upset. Our point is, maybe she\u2019ll start going by Reyy? Y\u2019know, like Fonzie! \u201cReyyyyyy!\u201d\n\nKylo Ren is getting a redemption arc\n\nIf we take the Occam\u2019s razor approach to this: Kylo Ren, formerly Ben Solo, is the primary Skywalker at the center of the narrative at this point in the whole space saga. In The Last Jedi, Rey spent a lot of time trying to turn him back from the Dark Side, which seemed like it might work, up until the point where he sliced straight through Supreme Leader Snoke and suggested he and Rey should just rule the galaxy together. That\u2019s not exactly good guy behavior, but Star Wars is ever-forgiving, like someone who can\u2019t give up on an ex, and could still try to redeem Kylo Ren with yet another flip back to good \u2014 perhaps after a tear-jerking memory of Leia \u2014 in a mirror of Anakin\u2019s arc from dweeb Padawan to Darth Vader to redemption. On the other hand, \u201crise\u201d is a morally neutral term. Perhaps the rise of Skywalker describes Kylo Ren\u2019s version of the First Order\u2019s increasing rise to power since he reduced the Resistance to a handful of people in the Millennium Falcon and one kid with a broom by the end of The Last Jedi. This Skywalker, potential for a change of heart or no, has indeed gotten very, very powerful.\n\n\u201cSkywalker\u201d is the new Jedi\n\nThe \u201cSkywalker Saga,\u201d a.k.a the primary set of Star Wars films, follows the story of one, extended family, but what could be a more democratic, hopeful ending for the series to have the idea of a \u201cSkywalker\u201d transform from an aristocratic lineage to something new? If the Jedi, an old-fashioned order too concerned with tradition to fight the rising tide of Palpatine\u2019s fascism, ended with The Last Jedi, could Rey and company found something new based on Luke\u2019s hopes for the future? \u201cSkywalker\u201d could well be plural \u2014 though, grammatically, it\u2019d be nice if there were a \u201cthe\u201d in front of \u201cSkywalker\u201d* to make this work. Rey is, spiritually, a Skywalker, and so too are whichever pupils she teaches. We\u2019re looking at you, broom boy!\n\nJ.J. Abrams is just riffing at this point\n\nJ.J., gotta love him, likes to end things with a bang, whether or not it makes sense. Remember how Alias got incomprehensibly tangled in its own mythology? Remember how Felicity incorporated time travel? (It was great.) Odds are, whatever\u2019s coming for Star Wars will probably come out of left field and involve some combination of time weirdness, giant red balls, and call-backs to other things he\u2019s enjoyed. Is there a universe in which Star Wars ends with Rey being catapulted into a heaven that resembles 1990s New York, where she gets a job at Dean & Deluca and has to decide between two men with nice hair? Probably not, but maybe. Maybe yes.\n\nThis is the long-awaited film adaptation of Star Wars: Alien Exodus\n\nSo back in the mid-1990s, when Star Wars was a significantly more niche interest than it is now or it had been 10 years prior, a sci-fi writer by the name of Robert J. Sawyer was tasked with pitching a publisher on a novel set in George Lucas\u2019s mythos. What he came up with was called Star Wars: Alien Exodus \u2014 and it was completely bonkers. Indeed, he envisioned a unified George Lucas Extended Universe where the descendants of Richard Dreyfuss\u2019s character from American Graffiti live in the dystopian Earth of THX-1138. Some of them and their friends flee earth in a spaceship, go through a \u201ccosmic whirlpool,\u201d and end up a long, long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. It turns out to be the prehistoric Star Wars galaxy, where they become enslaved, discover the Force, and lead an uprising where one of them becomes the first Jedi. That guy (spoiler alert) dies and is posthumously referred to as \u201cthe Skywalker\u201d because he was able to levitate. The book proposal eventually mutated into a non-Star Wars novel series by a different author, but Sawyer released his pitch and some sample chapters a few years ago. Now that we\u2019ve reached this point of the story, we\u2019re realizing that there\u2019s no way to tie it into the title of Episode IX. Dammit, now we\u2019ll never get that check from Disney.\n\n*This post has been updated to clarify which \u201cthe\u201d would be necessary in the title to make a certain theory seem more plausible.", "description": "What does the title Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker mean?
