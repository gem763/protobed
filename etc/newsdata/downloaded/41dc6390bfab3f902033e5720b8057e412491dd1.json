Zuckerberg is not an evil business mastermind. He doesn\u2019t run private prisons, his product doesn\u2019t kill hundreds of thousands of people a year, and he isn\u2019t destroying the environment. In many ways he epitomizes the American dream: He turned a privileged upbringing into a life of super-extra-Bond-villain power and privilege by building a better, more capable version of a thing that many other people had thought of before he did. Then he bought up every competitor he could and copied the ones he couldn\u2019t.\n\nHe played the game very well, ruthlessly and with frequent flashes of genius, and even if he failed to anticipate nearly every problem with his technology, he managed to deliver fabulous results to shareholders. Now he possesses more power to shape commerce, democracy and the human psyche than anyone ever thought possible \u2014 at least according to his sometimes hyperbolic critics in media and politics, who, let\u2019s not forget, also have a lot to lose in his rise.\n\nBut it is Zuckerberg\u2019s very wealth and power that is now becoming a cross to bear. Recently he has found it very hard to defend the existence of billionaires. And when critics point out his power, his instinct is to disclaim it.\n\nThis has been Facebook\u2019s whole message recently: Look, we\u2019re trying! We never asked to be this powerful! It just sort of happened! In speech after speech Zuckerberg now warns lawmakers that getting him to stringently police his network will only reward him with more power than he has somehow already lucked into.\n\nFor which I\u2019ll give him points: That\u2019s a correct position. No one can defend your wealth and power, Mark Zuckerberg, not even you.\n\nBut this is exactly why Zuckerberg makes a perfect political target for this moment. It\u2019s why Warren set him in her sights early and fires upon him so often. As a leader of what Zuckerberg recently called a \u201cFifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society,\u201d he possesses a new and unusual kind of leverage in the world, and none of us \u2014 not lawmakers, not the traditional media, not academics or tech companies \u2014 have figured out the best way to curb his role in society.\n\nThere\u2019s only one thing everyone seems to agree on, Zuckerberg included: that he is the epitome of having too much. To quote Kanye West, no one man should have all that power.", "description": "You\u2019re everyone\u2019s favorite political punching bag, for good reason.
