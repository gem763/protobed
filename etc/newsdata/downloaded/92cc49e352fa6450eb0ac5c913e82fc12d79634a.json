I suffer with my mental health, quite a few things actually.\n\n\"And I find this really nerve-wracking actually, I\u2019m shaking, to talk about.\"\n\nStephanie went on to detail a poem that she wrote after attempting suicide: \"I have suffered with suicidal thoughts, being suicidal and acting on it and I started writing a poem one night, just to get stuff off my head because my head\u2019s always on the go, and started writing it out and I thought I\u2019d read it to you.\"\n\nReading from a notepad, Stephanie told her followers: \"When you\u2019ve looked death in the eyes, nothing ever feels the same. How do you describe that crying side from the screaming inside of your brain?\n\n\"When I was asked how to describe it, the only thing I could say, staring into the abyss, someone\u2019s flicked off a switch, no more light and no more bright days.\n\n\"How helpless it feels to be helpless. How painful it feels when those there don\u2019t care. How could they not help me when all I needed was for them to be there?\"\n\nStephanie continued: \"To scream out in pain, to cry uncontrollable tears, to hurt myself so much, my life, I didn\u2019t care to be here.\n\n\"To get to that place of thinking that life isn\u2019t for me anymore, that\u2019s a scary place to get to, one I hope nobody has to endure.\"\n\nSpeaking about why she penned the verse, Stephanie said: \"But the reason I wrote this poem is because I ended up fighting through. I thought that if I just spoke out then maybe I could help you too.\n\n\"I can\u2019t say it was easy, but I can say I beat the pain. It wasn\u2019t easy to wake up and fight the fight from the easy option of ending the game.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t think I was worth it, but now I know I am. Other people\u2019s actions don\u2019t define the person I am.\n\n\"I thought I was a helpless case, a life that was bound to end. I had to start a relationship with myself, that I now call my friend.\n\n\"I cannot say I love myself, but I like myself enough to know that I am worth the fight, keep going and not give up.\n\n\"Don\u2019t sit and suffer in silence, get yourself out the bed. Because with the right help, there\u2019s a wonderful life ahead.\"\n\nOnce finished reading her poem, the infamous star of Celebrity Big Brother revealed what was happening inside her mind at the time.\n\nStephanie continued: \"When I was feeling like that, the thing I kept saying over and over was like, \u2018there\u2019s a switch gone off in my head, there\u2019s a light gone off in my head, the switch has gone off in my head,\u2019 and I can\u2019t describe how lonely that was and I was alone and I got through it alone and I had to fight it alone and that was probably the hardest thing, but I did it.\n\n\"Often our heads can trick us into thinking that the worst option is the best option.\n\n\"Suicide is permanent, it\u2019s permanent. But if you fight the way you\u2019re feeling, the feelings pass, they always pass.\"\n\nStephanie continued to say that she had to haul herself back from the precipice: \"I know it doesn\u2019t feel like that because I\u2019ve thought that, you know, I\u2019m screamed out like \u2018this is never gonna pass, this is never gonna end,' and I can say that I have been in hell and I\u2019ve got through it.\n\n\"It\u2019s always a constant battle but I\u2019ve got hope again. I thought I was a helpless case, like I said, so I hope that anybody that\u2019s listening to this and they\u2019re not in a good place, please reach out.\n\n\"To your mum, your dad, my family have been great with me, so great. Friends, I\u2019ve got amazing friends. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk to a stranger.\"\n\nStephanie urged her followers to not be too hard on themselves, as this is part of vicious circle downwards.\n\nShe continued: \"And don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad person, because I know I used to think I was a bad person.\n\n\"Because I thought it was a lot to do with the drink and then when I put that down I still couldn\u2019t cope with life and I just couldn\u2019t understand why.\n\n(Image: stephaniedavis88/Instagram)\n\n\"But I just felt exhausted at the end of the day, exhausted, just because of my head, let alone anything else going on in my life, and I understand now and I have answers and I got the right help and medication.\n\n\"You know, if you need that, take that. But don't suffer in silence and to other people who are feeling okay, make sure they ask someone if they are okay and if someone needs your help don't leave them, because you never know what could happen.\"\n\nStephanie finished her message: \"Everyone be kind and spread the love and, you know, like I always say it's okay not to be okay.\"\n\nFor confidential support, the Samaritans can be contacted for free around the clock 365 days a year on 116 123.", "description": "Stephanie Davis penned a poem for World Mental Health Day in which she detailed her battle with depression and suicidal thoughts", "authors": ["James Brinsford", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564373.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-12-at-010705.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
