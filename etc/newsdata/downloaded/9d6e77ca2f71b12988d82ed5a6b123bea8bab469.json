Impeach Trump.", "language": "en", "text": "Some evidently have concluded that accountability for this president will come with the 2020 election, and they want to leave it at that. They could not be more wrong. Losing an election (should that even happen) will not erase Trump\u2019s end run around the Constitution. Democrats have resisted impeachment in part because of a belief (not grounded in history) that impeachment should ensue only if removal is probable in the Senate.\n\nBut linking impeachment with removal loses the unique purpose of this constitutional check \u2014 spelling out and limiting the unconstitutional behavior of the president, which could serve to inform voters in 2020. That\u2019s what happened to Andrew Johnson, who was impeached but not removed and also not reelected. Impeachment is only a political question insofar as those making the decision are politicians with elections forthcoming. Win or lose in 2020, the long-term damage to our Constitution might well be done if the House fails to act now.\n\nThere\u2019s more than enough evidence. Let\u2019s skip the Mueller report for now. Skip the Russian interference; skip at least 10 identifiable acts of obstruction of justice. Even without the report, Democrats have plenty to act on to hold the president accountable for potentially unlawful behavior and abuse of power.", "description": "", "authors": ["Donna Edwards", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Time-Is-Running-Out-Impeach-Trump"], "top_image": ""}
