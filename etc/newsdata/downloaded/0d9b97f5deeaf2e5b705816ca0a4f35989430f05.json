RWC100: 60-41 1/21 Rugby World Cup 100 Which Rugby World Cup star will come out on top? 2/21 60: Dan Crowley Crowley (far right) is one of just five Australians to have won the Rugby World Cup twice, and started the 1999 final against France before hanging up his international boots. AFP/Getty Images 3/21 59: Emile Ntamack A three-time World Cup attendee, Ntamack's versatility came in great use for the French on their run to the 1999 final, where he started at centre despite spending most of his international career in the back-three. Getty Images 4/21 58: Shane Williams One of the most lethal finishers in the game's history, Williams enjoyed a breakthrough tournament in 2003, starring against New Zealand and England, and picked up where he left off in 2007 with a stunning try over Fiji. Getty Images 5/21 57: Daniel Herbert The other part of the famous Australian centre partnership with Tim Horan, Herbert was a star of the 1999 Rugby World Cup, having also featured at the 1995. Getty Images 6/21 56: Nick Farr-Jones The skipper of the 1991 World Cup winners, Farr-Jones demonstrated phenomenal strength and passing even for a scrum-half, while his leadership skills saw the Wallabies become the dominant force of the era. AFP/Getty Images 7/21 55: Jason Leonard Mr Dependable when it came to his World Cup exploits, playing for England in 1991, 1995, 1999 and 2003 when he finally became a much-deserved World Cup-winner. Getty Images 8/21 54: Sonny Bill Williams A two-time wrecking ball of a World Cup winner, Williams' ability to offload in contact is matched by no other. However, he stole the show in 2015 when he gave his winners' medal to a young fan who ran onto the pitch to hug him. One of the good guys of the sport. Getty Images 9/21 53: Ben Kay Had he finished that try in the 2003 World Cup final, he would've been a lot higher in the list. But perhaps he can take credit for producing that thrilling extra-time final in Melbourne. Either way, he formed a formidable partnership with Leicester teammate Martin Johnson. Getty Images 10/21 52: Neil Back Part of the famous English back-row os 2003, Back had a unique ability to play openside flanker his way, while he was never short of a trick or two to help his side out. Getty Images 11/21 51: Abdelatif Benazzi Hugely influential in helping France to the 1999 World Cup final, in what was his third appearance at the global gathering. A towering lock who never failed to let his presence be known. AFP/Getty Images 12/21 50: Andrew Merhtens Came within a whisker of becoming a World Cup winner in 1995, only for the Springboks and Joel Stransky to deny him. Sadly his World Cup career ended in 1999 as he was overlooked for the 2003 tournament, but by then he had already left a solid impression on the sport. Getty Images 13/21 49: Rupeni Caucaunibuca Arguably the most eye-catching player in World Cup history, Caucau took the 2003 tournament by storm with three devastating tries in two games. Had he had more discipline, we may have seen even more from him at other tournaments, but his 2003 showcase is enough to leave a lasting memory in itself. Getty Images 14/21 48: Phil Vickery A World Cup winner in 2003, Vickery emerged as the somewhat surprising man to captain England to the 2007 World Cup, where an unexpected resurrection saw them come within a whisker of retaining the Webb Ellis Cup. Arguably England's best tighthead prop. Getty Images 15/21 47: Sam Warburton Thrown in at the deep end as Wales captain in 2011, Warburton was one of the stars of the tournament as they reached the semi-finals - only for his red card against France seeing the wheels fall off. That said, he lead the team fantastically once again in 2015 as they knocked England out in the pool stage, and remains one of the most pleasant individuals to have played the game. Getty Images 16/21 46: Joe Roff Selected for the 1995 World Cup at just 19 years old, Roff made an impressive start to his international career before starring at the successful 1999 edition. Roff made a third World Cup in 2003, though had to make do with a role as a replacement for the latter stages. Getty Images 17/21 45: Tony Woodcock One of the more unheralded All Blacks of the double-World Cup triumph, but with 118 caps to his name Woodcock's worth to New Zealand cannot be done justice. One of the great loosehead props of all time. Getty Images 18/21 44: Juan Martin Hernandez A magician with the ball in his hands of one the end of his boot, Hernandez it up the 2007 World Cup as Argentina announced their arrival as a force to be reckoned with. A member of the four World Cups club, Hernandez remains one of the most exciting and attacking-minded players to have graced the game. AFP/Getty Images 19/21 43: Matt Burke The Australian full-back was instrumental in the 1999 World Cup victory, with his ability to kick goals for fun proving a key weapon in the Wallabies armoury. He also helped Australia to the 2003 final, though lost his place in the 15 shirt to Chris Latham by that point. Getty Images 20/21 42: Ayumu Gorumaru The man who pulled the strings in the 'Miracle of Brighton', Goromaru scored a brilliant 24 points to inspire the victory over the Springboks in what was a very successful campaign for the fly-half in 2015. Getty Images 21/21 41: Matt Giteau A genius with the ball who filled no fewer than five positions during his career with the Wallabies. Giteau was just 20 when he made his World Cup debut in 2003, but such was his worth to Australian rugby, the ARU changed the rules to bring him back for a fourth World Cup in 2015.
