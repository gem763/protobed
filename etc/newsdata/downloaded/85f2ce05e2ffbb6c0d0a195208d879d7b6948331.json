On the contrary, the government may be leading him to his death.\n\nSegovia is currently imprisoned at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center in Adelanto, California where he says he is being denied critical medical and mental health care. The 38-year-old veteran is facing deportation to El Salvador, a country he left when he was three years old and where his loved ones fear he could be killed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to die here. I refuse to die here,\u201d Segovia said on a recent morning, wearing a red jail uniform and seated in a cramped room with no windows to the outside.\n\nDuring his 21 months of detention in the southern California facility, Ice has failed to provide adequate care for Segovia\u2019s serious heart condition, denied him proper treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and repeatedly placed him in isolation, according to the former marine and his lawyers. The consequences, they fear, could be fatal.\n\nSegovia is one of fifteen current detainees who filed a federal lawsuit against Ice last month alleging medical neglect and horrific conditions that rise to the level of \u201ctorture\u201d. He is also one of the estimated thousands of veterans who have faced deportation over the years despite their service to the country.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t know how much more he could take and was desperate to leave Adelanto and return to his hometown and family in Long Beach, California: \u201cI want my freedom so bad \u2026 I try to hold onto any kind of strength I have, but I\u2019m not doing well mentally, emotionally, physically.\u201d\n\nLife after war: \u2018I tried to seek help\u2019\n\nSegovia, who became a legal permanent resident soon after arriving in the US as a child, became interested in the military at a very young age.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jose Segovia Benitez enlisted in the US Marine Corps one week after graduating high school. Photograph: Courtesy the family of Jose Segovia Benitez\n\nRaised in Long Beach, a city just south of Los Angeles, he has early memories of playing with toy soldiers. In high school, he was different from his peers and drawn to the discipline of the Junior Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps, a US Army program for students.\n\nAt age 18 in 1999, one week after he graduated high school, he enlisted in the marines.\n\n\u201cI joined not to go to war, because nobody ever signs up for that,\u201d he said.\n\nBut then war happened.\n\nHe was deployed as part of the initial Iraq invasion in 2003, ultimately completing two tours of duty.\n\nHis mother, Martha Garcia, recalled the stress of his deployment and her constant fear that soldiers would show up at her door announcing his death: \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to go. It was very, very scary for me. But he said, \u2018No, I wanna go.\u2019\u201d\n\nSegovia survived \u2013 but barely. He was honorably discharged in 2004 after he was badly injured by an explosive device in Iraq the year before.\n\nHe struggles to talk about it today: \u201cI\u2019ve seen combat. I don\u2019t like that subject, I stay away from it.\u201d\n\nLife after war was a battle, and he said he had a hard time returning to society and finding a stable routine.\n\nDoctors suggested he find jobs that didn\u2019t involve loud noises, because that triggered his PTSD, his mother said. He worked a range of jobs, including in retail, security and manual labor. Meanwhile, he struggled to get the urgent mental health treatment he needed from Veterans Affairs, she said, adding it took roughly seven years to properly diagnose his PTSD and traumatic brain injury.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Segovia, a US marine veteran, is now fighting deportation to El Salvador. Photograph: Courtesy the family of Jose Segovia Benitez\n\n\u201cI was trying to seek help,\u201d Segovia Benitez said. \u201cMeanwhile, you\u2019re doing your own therapy.\u201d\n\nHe struggled with substance abuse, had run-ins with the law, and was ultimately convicted of numerous serious felony crimes related to drug possession and violent offenses. He was sent to prison and due to be released in January of 2018.\n\nHe was eager to get out, his mother recalled. She was planning to make him a welcome-home meal of tamales.\n\nBut he never came. After serving his sentence, Ice agents were awaiting him at the prison to take him into custody.\n\nWhen immigrants are sentenced to \u2018double jeopardy\u2019\n\nImmigrants have long served in the military, with an estimated 5,000 enlisting each year. Service has traditionally provided a path to citizenship for foreign-born members, and roughly 130,000 of them have been naturalized since 2001.\n\nHowever bureaucratic challenges mean some immigrant service members don\u2019t complete it, and under the Trump administration, a series of changes have made the process even harder. Some also mistakenly believe citizenship is automatic, advocates say. When immigrant veterans who haven\u2019t been naturalized are convicted of certain felonies, they can then be deported.\n\nIce says it doesn\u2019t know how many veterans it has deported, but groups that assist deported veterans have tracked roughly 400 cases since 2014. Advocates estimate there are likely thousands.\n\nIn deportation proceedings, Ice is required to take into consideration a veteran\u2019s health and deployment record and elevate their cases to senior officials, but a federal watchdog department recently found that the agency frequently failed to do so.\n\nSegovia repeatedly submitted paperwork for naturalization, but the process was never completed, according to Brandee Dudzic, one of his advocates.\n\n\u201cThe system was designed for them to fail at every single step of the way,\u201d said Dudzic, founder of Repatriate Our Patriots. Immigrant service members sometimes start the immigration process and then get deployed and the paperwork doesn\u2019t follow them, or they have difficulties navigating bureaucracy due to PTSD.\n\nAs a result, disabled veterans have ended up in prisons and then Ice detention centers where their struggles to access healthcare are exacerbated and their mental health further deteriorates.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Segovia served two tours of duty before being honorably discharged. Photograph: Courtesy the family of Jose Segovia Benitez\n\n\u201cThis was not what I envisioned my life to be,\u201d Segovia said.\n\nHe noted that he was already incarcerated for his offenses, served his sentence and paid his debts to society. Instead of letting him rebuild his life, he is being punished again \u2013 in new and more severe ways: \u201cYou hear about double jeopardy, but this feels like triple jeopardy \u2026 I did time, and now I\u2019m being exiled?\u201d\n\nOne of the most upsetting moments of his detention, he said, was when an Ice agent suggested that America was not his home. \u201c\u2018Thank you for your service, but you were not born in this country\u2019,\u201d Segovia recalled the officer saying.\n\nIn Adelanto, a legacy of death and scandal\n\nThe immigration jail where Segovia has lived for more than 20 months is located in Adelanto, a remote desert town that is a two-hour drive inland from Los Angeles. A road sign at the edge of town advertises a \u201ccity with unlimited possibilities\u201d.\n\nGeo Group, the private prison company that runs the jail, has repeatedly been accused of abuse and neglect. Last year, a US government audit found there were \u201cnooses\u201d made out of bedsheets in 15 cells, which guards overlooked even though someone had died by suicide in 2017. That year, three detainees died within three months, and there were reports of at least five suicide attempts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The immigration jail where Segovia has lived for 21 months.

I\u2019ve been in a downward spiral of depression.\u201d\n\nHe has been isolated in segregation multiple times, typically for three to five days, during which time he did not receive daily medical or mental health check-ins, according to the recent lawsuit filed by Disability Rights Advocates and other groups.\n\nHe has repeatedly complained of chest pain, dizziness and other heart problems, but has been denied timely care, the suit said. Lawyers alleged that the facility \u201centirely ignored\u201d multiple abnormal cardiology test results, and that on 3 July, after he reported significant chest pain, he wasn\u2019t evaluated for seven hours. At that point, the facility called 911 and took him to emergency care.\n\nSegovia had no way to tell his family, and after his mother didn\u2019t hear from him by phone, she rushed to the detention center in person, demanding answers, she recalled.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to leave until you tell me where my son is\u2019,\u201d said Garcia, 58. \u201cThey said, \u2018You can\u2019t see him. He\u2019s not here\u2019.\u201d\n\nEventually, she heard from the family member of another detainee that he had been hospitalized, but she couldn\u2019t find out where he was taken and wasn\u2019t able to visit him.\n\n\u201cHow am I going to get better?\u201d Segovia asked. Some days, he added, \u201cI shut down. I close everybody out.\u201d\n\nAn enduring patriotism: \u2018I took an oath\u2019\n\nSegovia is running out of options.\n\nAn Ice spokeswoman said in a statement to the Guardian that he is a \u201ccitizen of El Salvador\u201d who was \u201cordered removed to his home country\u201d and has an \u201cextensive criminal history\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u201cPatriotism is still a part of me,\u201d Segovia said, showing his tattoo of the Statue of Liberty. Photograph: Damon Casarez/The Guardian\n\nA Geo Group spokesperson did not comment on Segovia\u2019s case, but said the allegations in the lawsuit were \u201cbaseless\u201d and that the corporation\u2019s medical programs \u201cprovide 24/7 access to health care free of charge \u2026 supported by professional teams, including full-time physicians\u201d. The VA declined to comment.\n\nSegovia\u2019s advocates are now urging California governor Gavin Newsom to pardon him for his criminal record, which would shield him from deportation to El Salvador, where he would be vulnerable to gang violence.\n\nGarcia said she wanted Newsom to know that her son\u2019s incarceration and pending deportation was ruining so many lives. \u201cIt\u2019s not just my son. My whole family is broken. We\u2019re asking him to please help.\u201d\n\nFor Segovia, being forced to live in his birth country is unfathomable: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing over there for me.\u201d\n\nSegovia said he tries to stay positive and spends time assisting deaf detainees, who can\u2019t communicate with the guards. He learned sign language after he thought he might lose his hearing due to injuries overseas.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to see injustices. I have to stand up for those that need help,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not afraid of retaliation because I\u2019ve been through worse.\u201d\n\nSomedays, he wants to be deported, just to feel free. But he continues to fight for the sake of his family.\n\nAnd despite everything, his love for his country remains deep, he said. He has a tattoo of the Statue of Liberty on the side of his body and another on his arm that says USMC to commemorate his service.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is still a part of me. I took an oath long ago, and I haven\u2019t untaken that oath,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cEverything I love is here. Everything I know is in Long Beach, California.\u201d", "description": "In his 21 months of detention, Jose Segovia Benitez says he\u2019s been denied critical treatment for his PTSD and heart condition", "authors": ["Sam Levin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42943b55dd663362b3a2eebf62397e83e7e6931e/0_215_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f38d9b9d9f1c0a1c34aabd72cc8836ae", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
