The controversy was also fueled by a clip posted in a tweet by a columnist from the right-wing Daily Caller.\n\nBut CNN found a 2016 obituary for \u201cCorn Pop\u201d and quoted a former mayor of Wilmington, Delaware, where the pool was located, who said Corn Pop, \u201creal as the moon in the sky,\u201d was confrontational. The former mayor \u2014 and others \u2014 also heard of the confrontation at the time.\n\nIn addition, a CNN fact check by reporter Daniel Dale confirmed that the \u201cRomans\u201d gang existed at the time in Wilmington.\n\nCorn Pop was a \u201cbad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys,\u201d the former vice president said at a 2017 appearance at the pool, which has been named after him. But Biden, who has said he was the only white lifeguard at the predominantly black pool, dared to call out Corn Pop for bouncing on the diving board.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2019Hey Esther, off the board or I\u2019ll come up and drag you off,\u201d he recounted. Biden was referring to the actress Esther Williams, known at the time for choreographed swimming scenes in Hollywood movies. Anyone with \u201cpomade\u201d in his hair, as Corn Pop did, had to wear swimming caps, Biden explained, which Biden apparently thought heightened Corn Pop\u2019s similarity to the actress.\n\nCorn Pop got off the board, but then waited for Biden at his car with \u201cthree guys [all] with straight razors,\u201d he recalled. \u201cNo joke.\u201d Biden said he wrapped a heavy chain around his arm and told Corn Pop he had to listen to him at the pool. But he apologized for calling him Esther Williams.\n\nCorn Pop \u201cclosed the straight razor, and my heart began to beat again,\u201d said Biden, who insisted the men became friends.\n\nThis is BIZARRE!\n\nHere's Joe Biden telling the story of his face-off with a gang of razor-wielding ne'er-do-wells led by a guy named 'Corn Pop.' pic.twitter.com/DddRtWgdza \u2014 Eddie Zipperer (@EddieZipperer) September 15, 2019\n\nFormer state NAACP President Richard \u201cMouse\u201d Smith has supported Biden\u2019s account. He said Corn Pop was the leader of the Romans and had threatened Biden. Smith said Biden \u201cstood his ground\u201d against Corn Pop after he threatened to \u201ccut him.\u201d\n\nBut Harriot\u2019s suspicions about the story set Twitter aflame \u2014 from all sides.\n\nThread: I'm always astounded by the imaginings of white people as it relates to race. Many of them have this fictionalized jigaboo version that is almost alien-like. And one of the greatest examples of this ever is Joe Biden's story about Corn Pop the gangsta. \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nBut this is not about Biden.\n\n\n\nThis is a celebration of the life of a straight razor-carrying certified street thug who I'd bet my pinky toe never existed. But if you ask Biden, I bet he'd say Corn Pop has passed on.\n\n\n\nRIP my nigga Corn Pop.\n\nThis is how it sounds when thugs die \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nYes Virginia there really is a \u201ccorn pop.\u201d https://t.co/8N2fh3jNyU \u2014 Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) September 15, 2019\n\nGET OUT OF THE DARN POOL, CORN POP!

What it means to him and why. What message is conveyed and how and at whose expense and whose gain) \u2014 Martha Crawford LCSW (@shrinkthinks) September 15, 2019\n\n2. For some reason many people are assuming that Corn Pop isn't real etc. I am certainly not saying that. It's more about the VP's delivery. https://t.co/v55RlWdoxR \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) September 15, 2019", "description": "Twitter critics are suspicious about the 1962 incident involving the \u201cRomans\u201d gang leader that Biden insists threatened him at a swimming pool.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ec1583b0000c49fd44a2e.jpeg?cache=cul0skrnls&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
