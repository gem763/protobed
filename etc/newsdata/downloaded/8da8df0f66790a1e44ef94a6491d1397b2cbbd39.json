As a reminder, Microsoft has been testing its processes for releasing the 19H2 feature update to users on the May 2019 update using the same technologies it uses to release cumulative updates.\n\nFor testers in the 19H2 Release Preview ring, the build brings the same features that were shipped to testers in the Slow ring earlier this month.\n\nBack then, it enabled the 'seeker' experience for all users in the 19H2 in the Release Preview ring, meaning users should see a Windows 10, version 1909 update available If they go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update.\n\nAt the time it also began pushing 19H2 to 10% of Windows Insiders in the Release Preview ring as well. This subset of Insiders in the Release Preview ring would have seen 19H2 Build 18363.329 offered automatically.\n\nMicrosoft today noted that Insiders in the Release Preview ring who aren't on 19H2 yet should still see a Windows 10 version 1909 update available in Windows Update.\n\nSEE: Windows 10 in 2020: Microsoft shows off faster Bluetooth pairing in 20H1 preview\n\nThe features, which are already available to Insiders in the Slow ring, include a new way to quickly create an event from the Calendar flyout on the Taskbar.\n\nThe Start menu now expands when mousing over it, while new images help clarify what is meant by 'banner' and Action Center when using settings to control notifications on apps.\n\nThere are also several changes that should make notifications easier to manage and configure.\n\nMore on Microsoft's Windows 10 updates", "description": "Microsoft has released two new updates to testers in the Release Preview ring for Windows 10 19H1 and 19H2.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/29/5b831216-c24c-4637-96c3-c6998cb83347/thumbnail/770x578/5c5b813054a7ad2d2b5ed3bb9c04819b/awindowslondon141.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
