Hurd: Trump Asking China to Investigate Bidens Is \u2018Terrible\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "On Friday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d Representative Will Hurd (R-TX) stated that President Trump calling on China to investigate the Bidens is \u201cterrible.\u201d\n\nHurd stated, \u201cI think it\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s something that I wouldn\u2019t have done, and I can go two days \u2014 I think two days before that, wishing China congratulations on 70 years of Communism via a tweet is not something I would do either. China is an adversary. China right now has a million ethnic minorities, the Uyghurs, in basically \u2014 in prison camps. Also, we\u2019re in a tight and complex trade negotiation with China now. And so, you\u2019re potentially giving them something to hold over your head. And I would expect that, prior to our upcoming elections, to see the Chinese do something to manipulate their currency or impact global markets in order to have an impact on the U.S. economy going into an election. So, I think that is something that a president of the United States shouldn\u2019t be doing.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Friday's broadcast of CNN's \"New Day,\" Representative Will Hurd (R-TX) stated that President Trump calling on China to investigate the Bidens is | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Hurd-104-Thumbnail-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
