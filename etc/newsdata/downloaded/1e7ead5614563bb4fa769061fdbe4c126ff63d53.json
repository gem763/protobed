A dupe is a product that in some ways works as well as \u2014 or better than \u2014 a fancier, more famous thing, and we're sharing our favorites. Welcome to Dupes Week. Photo: The writer wearing her Maybelline concealer\n\nNo matter how much sleep I get or what top-of-the-line eye cream I try, I always wake up with heavy purple under-eye circles that seem impossible to hide. When I started working in magazines, everyone advised me to try Cl\u00e9 de Peau because it\u2019s the \u201choly grail\u201d of concealers. After seeing the $70 price tag, I felt especially lucky that, thanks to the magazine-world gods, I was able to try it for free. And yeah, it\u2019s good. Really good. The twist-up tube applies smoothly with or without a brush (I\u2019m partial to blending with my fingers) and melts into my skin. It\u2019s thick but doesn\u2019t feel heavy on. My dark circles vanished.\n\nMore options slid across my desk: NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, Tarte Shape Tape, Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Concealer. But the only one I would actually buy for myself is Maybelline\u2019s Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Concealer.\n\nIt caught my attention mostly because of the sponge. Pressing it directly under my downturned eyes, the little round applicator bounces seamlessly across my pale complexion. Unlike Cl\u00e9 de Peau, where it takes a bit more finagling (or a brush) to apply exactly where I want it, the Maybelline sponge easily follows the contour of my under-eye. It\u2019s definitely not as thick as other beloved concealers (you couldn\u2019t squeeze Cl\u00e9 de Peau through a sponge), but I don\u2019t mind because it does the job, possibly even better.\n\nIt does not have SPF like Cl\u00e9 de Peau. But it is considered a \u201ctreatment\u201d concealer, infused with an ingredient called Haloxyl that is said to rid the skin of the colored pigments that make for dark circles. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve noticed any permanent changes in this regard (although my eyes seem not to look so heavy even after I take it off). What\u2019s especially impressive about the Maybelline, though, is its range of 18 different shades \u2014 admittedly not as vast as the 40-plus options you get from the Fenty line, but still much more than the mere six different color tones you get from Cl\u00e9. I have cool undertones, so many concealers look too yellow on my skin, yet I can easily find my correct match with this concealer. My sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9e describes herself as mixed-race (half-white, one-quarter black, and one-quarter Japanese) and typically has to combine different colors to get the proper look, but she says Maybelline is the first where she has found her color right away. Because of the price, she even buys multiples in different shades for different seasons, like when she\u2019s come back tan from a trip home to Hawaii.\n\nShe and I have bonded over this concealer; it cleans up our complexions and wakes up our eyes. My dark circles don\u2019t creep through midday, and if I ever need a rare quick touch-up, it\u2019s just a refresher; I\u2019m not starting over as if I never applied anything to begin with. Plus I can feel more liberal in applying the stuff \u2014 I can purchase seven of them for the price of one Cl\u00e9 de Peau.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
