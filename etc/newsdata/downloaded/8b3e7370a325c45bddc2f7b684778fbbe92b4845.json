A plane operated entirely by women flew 120 young girls to NASA's headquarters to celebrate International Girls in Aviation Day.\n\nThe passengers on Delta's fifth-annual WING flight \u2014 \"Woman Inspiring our Next Generation\" \u2014 ranged in age from 12 to 18. The aim of the program is to expose young girls to STEM careers and work towards gender equality in the aviation industry.\n\nFor many of the girls who all came from schools with STEM or aviation programs, it was their first time flying. They got to experience a flight run entirely by women as they headed for NASA's Johnson Space Center.\n\nDelta sent 120 girls to NASA with an all-female crew to celebrate International Girls in Aviation Day. Delta\n\n\"From nose to tail, the flight was planned and orchestrated exclusively by women \u2014 including the pilots flying the plane, ramp agents working on the ground, gate agents boarding the flight and women in the tower guiding the aircraft on its way out,\" Delta wrote in a statement.\n\nIn Houston, the group participated in a range of activities, including touring NASA's Mission Control Center and eating lunch with NASA astronaut and aerospace engineer Jeanette Epps.\n\n\"I never would have thought I would have had this experience. I'm really grateful for my parents who have made this possible and inspired my love of aviation,\" said 16-year-old Karyanna H., an 11th grader at Jordan Technical Institute. \"It's such an exciting time to be in STEM. There's so much left for us to discover.\"\n\nAccording to Delta, only about five percent of its pilots are women, which is standard throughout the industry. In the last four years, Delta said just over seven percent of new hire pilots have been women.\n\nAt NASA, the girls toured the Mission Control Center, Building 9, Johnson Space Center and Space Center Houston. They also met with female technicians, engineers and astronaut Jeanette Epps. Delta\n\n\"It didn't seem realistic to go after a career in aviation, but today I realized, 'Hey, I can do this too,'\" said 17-year-old Katelyn J., a 12th grader from Advanced Learning Center.\n\nAccording to Women in Aviation International, 20,000 attendees participated in International Girls in Aviation Day this year. Seventeen countries participated to introduce girls to careers in aviation and aerospace.\n\n\"We know representation matters. At Delta, we believe you have to see it to be it,\" said Beth Poole, General Manager of Pilot Development. \"We're taking ownership to improve gender diversity by exposing girls at a young age and providing a pipeline so that 10 years from now, they will be the pilots in the Delta cockpit inspiring generations of women who follow.\"", "description": "\"It didn't seem realistic to go after a career in aviation, but today I realized, 'Hey, I can do this too,'\" one 17-year-old student said", "authors": ["Sophie Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/11/f55d768e-7cfd-4ad3-b754-8e1d30ad84a0/thumbnail/1200x630/e877eab5952c7ff95af8adc1753dfac3/wing-flight-selfie-2000px.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
