But it\u2019s also possible he\u2019s acting in good faith, and it\u2019s worth noting that the two sides are still talking. Johnson\u2019s proposal is, as he says, a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d compromise \u2014 and a real improvement over the withdrawal agreement that his predecessor Theresa May reached with the European Union (and that the House of Commons rejected three times).\n\nFrom the start, the main sticking point in the talks has been what Brexit means for the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Johnson\u2019s plan would leave the North, which is part of the U.K., inside the EU\u2019s single market for goods, while taking the province (along with the rest of the U.K.) outside the EU\u2019s customs union. The result would be \u201ctwo borders\u201d \u2014 a regulatory border between all of Ireland and the U.K., and a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAlignment with the EU single market would avoid the need for regulatory checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Ireland; checks would instead be needed on goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. Exiting the EU\u2019s customs union would require checks for goods moving between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but these could be done away from the border, according to Johnson, using trusted-trader and other schemes to smooth the process. In practical terms, the border would be, as now, invisible.\n\nGranted, this is all very complicated \u2014 but any viable solution to the border conundrum is going to be complicated.\n\nThe U.K. could simply remain a member of the EU, of course, allowing the Irish border to dictate its constitutional and economic choices. Or, as Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement proposed, it could leave the union in the sense of no longer having any say in its policies, while being forced to follow most of them for as long as the EU saw fit. But if the U.K. intends to leave the EU to pursue an independent trade policy and recover its national sovereignty \u2014 right or wrong, not an unreasonable ambition \u2014 then complicated arrangements to maintain an invisible border between Northern Ireland and Ireland are going to be necessary.\n\nThe leader of the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group said Johnson\u2019s plan was \u201crepackaging old, bad ideas.\u201d Ireland\u2019s Prime Minister, Leo Varadkar, said it offered no basis for agreement. But if the EU keeps insisting on no checks whatsoever on goods moving between North and South \u2013 not even customs checks away from the border \u2014 the plain implication is that Brexit requires the economic annexation of Northern Ireland to the EU.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, of course, that this would be in Northern Ireland\u2019s longer-term interests. But imposing it abruptly surely cannot be defended \u2013 as Ireland and the EU wish to defend it \u2014 as upholding the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, which depends on the consent of Northern Irish unionists and nationalists alike.\n\nJohnson says that Northern Ireland should periodically affirm its consent to this proposed regulatory alignment with the EU. Europe\u2019s leaders find that troubling \u2014 the notion of consent often gives them pause \u2014 and the idea raises other problems, not least that the Belfast Assembly is currently suspended. But the issue underlines that if any party to these talks should be worried by Johnson\u2019s plan, it\u2019s the Northern Irish unionists, a group previously accused of dictating U.K. policy.\n\nAvoiding a border in the Irish Sea has up to now been the unionists\u2019 main red line. Moreover, Northern Irish businesses reacted to Johnson\u2019s plan with dismay. If it\u2019s implemented, there might be no visible border on the island of Ireland, but the new procedures required for the North to trade with the U.K., Ireland and the rest of the world will be even more burdensome than its companies had feared.\n\nSo you might have expected the government in Dublin to sense an opportunity in the ideas they\u2019ve just denounced. Agree to what Johnson proposes; avoid the no-deal outcome that would do grave damage to Ireland; cooperate in maintaining an invisible border with the North and peace on the island; and sit back as the North gets used to that border in the Irish Sea, enjoying the benefits of regulatory alignment with Ireland and the EU while the rest of the U.K. goes its own way. Uphold the principle of consent that many EU leaders find so alarming \u2014 and see majority opinion in the North come around to the view that the time for Irish unification has arrived.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Boris Johnson\u2019s new Brexit proposal has gotten such a chilly reception in Europe that some people think it must have been designed to be rejected: Johnson is less interested in getting a deal, on this theory, than in deflecting blame for the inevitable breakdown.No doubt Britain", "authors": ["Clive Crook"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
