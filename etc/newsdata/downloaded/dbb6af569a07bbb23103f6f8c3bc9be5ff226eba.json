The suit accused the outlet of defaming Sandmann in \u201cfalse and defamatory articles\u201d that suggested he \u201cassaulted and/or physically intimidated\u201d Phillips and \u201cwrongfully targeted and bullied Nicholas because he was the white, Catholic student wearing a red \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 souvenir cap.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Covington Student Nicholas Sandmann Sues Washington Post for $250 Million\n\nIn July, U.S. District Judge William Bertelsman dismissed the case, ruling that \u201cSandmann\u2019s allegation attempts to insert innuendo not found within \u2026 the publication.\u201d\n\nBut on Monday, Bertelson reversed course, ordering that while the majority of his previous ruling remained, three published statements in articles that the plaintiff took issue with in the initial suit \u2014 which all included claims that Sandmann \u201cblocked\u201d Phillips and \u201cwould not allow him to retreat\u201d \u2014 were plausible enough to move the lawsuit forward to the discovery phase.\n\nAlso Read: Covington Catholic High School Student's Lawsuit Against The Washington Post Dismissed\n\n\u201cSuffice to say that the Court has given this matter careful review and concludes that \u2018justice requires\u2019 that discovery be had regarding these statements and their context. The Court will then consider them anew on summary judgment,\u201d Bertelson wrote, essentially narrowing the statements in question from 33 down to three.\n\nSandmann\u2019s amended suit also adds more detail regarding Phillips\u2019 \u201cstate of mind,\u201d which Bertelson said in his court order sheds new light on \u201cthe original complaint that Phillips deliberately lied concerning the events at issue, and that he had an unsavory reputation which, but for the [Washington Post\u2019s] negligence or malice, would have alerted [the Post] to this fact.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: NBCUniversal Slapped With $275 Million Defamation Suit by Covington Student\n\nNBCUniversal and CNN are also facing similar defamation suits from the Sandmann family.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge win. Now #NickSandmann will be able to start discovery and find out exactly what the reporters were thinking when they attacked Nicholas and the #CovingtonCatholic kids,\u201d Sandmann\u2019s lawyer, Todd McMurtry, tweeted on Monday.\n\nA representative for the Post declined to comment.\n\nRead original story Covington Student Nicholas Sandmann\u2019s Defamation Lawsuit Against the Washington Post Partially Reopened At TheWrap", "description": "A federal judge in Kentucky partially reopened a defamation lawsuit on Monday filed by Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann against the Washington Post, allowing an amended version of the suit to move on to the discovery phase.Sandmann filed a $250 million defamation lawsuit against", "authors": ["J.
