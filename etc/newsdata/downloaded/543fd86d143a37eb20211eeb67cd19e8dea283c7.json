Some sections are mere fragments while others are intact scrolls.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient texts itself sounds like something out of scripture: nomadic Bedouin shepherds found cloth-wrapped scrolls hidden in jars in the Qumran caves of the West Bank.\n\nMost of the writings are on parchment sheets \u2013 some of which have been tanned, an eastern practice, while some are untanned or lightly tanned, a western practice.\n\nOne of the most remarkable intact scrolls is the Temple scroll, a manuscript that was reportedly sold by the Bedouins to an antique dealer who wrapped it in cellophane and stuck it in a shoe-box under his floor. The scroll is now housed with many of the other Dead Sea scrolls in the Shrine of the Book, part of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.\n\nThe bright, pale scroll \u2013 which is more than 8 metres long and written on parchment sheets whitened through treatment with a salt called alum \u2013 has a number of unusual features. It is wafer thin \u2013 experts have suggested it might have been made from an animal skin split in two \u2013 and unlike most scrolls, the text is on the flesh side of the skin. Even more surprisingly, the text is written on a thick mineral-containing layer that forms a writing surface on top of the collagen.\n\n\u201cThe layer reminds [one] of plaster on a wall,\u201d said Prof Ira Rabin, another author of the study.\n\nIsrael brings Dead Sea scrolls to life with upgrade of digital archive Read more\n\nNow, writing in the journal Science Advances, Masic and colleagues report that they have analysed a fragment of the Temple Scroll to unpick the makeup of this mineral-containing layer.\n\nThe results suggest the writing surface is largely composed of sulfate salts, including glauberite, gypsum and thenardite \u2013 minerals that dissolve in water and are left behind when the water evaporates.\n\nHowever, the researchers say these salts are not typical for the Dead Sea region, raising questions of where exactly they came from.\n\nProf Timothy Lim from the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, said the findings did not show that the Temple scroll did not come from the region, even if the salts used in its preparation might come from elsewhere.\n\nHowever, Prof Jonathan Ben-Dov from the University of Haifa disagreed: \u201cI am not the least surprised to learn that a part of the scrolls was not prepared in the Dead Sea region. It would be naive to assume that they were all prepared there.\u201d\n\nRabin said: \u201cWe believe the [Temple scroll] primary treatment is consistent with the \u2018western\u2019 way [of parchment preparation]. But the detailed treatment is rather unique.\u201d\n\nThe team say the findings raise questions of how best to conserve the Dead Sea scrolls, noting that the sulfate salts might mean the scrolls are more sensitive to small changes in humidity than previously thought.\n\nAmong those who welcomed the findings was Dr Kipp Davis from the Dead Sea Scrolls Institute at Trinity Western University in Canada, one of the academics who recently revealed that the trade in fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls was full of fakes.\n\n\u201cThis is an important study that reveals a number of things which promise to continue to be helpful in the study of ancient Jewish scribal culture, but moreover also in our efforts to develop more robust and reliable techniques for evaluating authenticity and forgery in ancient manuscripts,\u201d he said.", "description": "Salts used on Temple scroll are not common to Dead Sea region, researchers find", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b2be653ae2609b69d58dd850c8007b8f0d404bc/465_45_1762_1058/master/1762.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8bbfdc0d56627020bf255f1c3a88e486", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
