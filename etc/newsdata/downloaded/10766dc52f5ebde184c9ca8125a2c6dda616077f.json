However the government revised its growth forecast for next year down to 1.3 per cent.\n\nGERMANY URGED TO INVEST\n\nMr Le Maire called on Germany to invest to prevent the flagging eurozone economy from getting worse.\n\n\"Germany must invest and invest now, the sooner the better,\" he said.\n\n\"Do not wait for the economic situation to worsen to make the necessary decisions.\"\n\nHe also defended European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, who has come under heavy criticism in some circles, including Germany, for unleashing a huge stimulus package aimed at propping up the eurozone economy.\n\n\"We support the courageous decision made by the ECB and its president,\" he said.\n\nBudget Minister Gerald Darmanin said this week that the creation of a pay-as-you-go income tax system, which did away with self-reporting months after the fiscal year-end, had brought a two-billion-euro windfall to state coffers.\n\nThe government has already indicated that defence and security spending will increase next year, offset by cuts at the finance and budget ministries, and reduced funds for local authorities.\n\nYet Mr Macron has abandoned his pledge of slashing 50,000 central government jobs during his five-year term, saying that only 10,500 would be now be cut.\n\n\"France has chosen the right economic policies, even if it was forced to do so\" because of the yellow vest revolt, said Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Ostrum Asset Management in Paris.\n\n\"We have a European economy that's slowing quite rapidly, and you're not going to reverse this by cutting back even more,\" he told AFP.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [PARIS] France's government unveiled a draft 2020 budget on Thursday with more than nine billion euros in tax cuts for households as it hopes to move on from on from roiling \"yellow vest\" protests while still cutting the deficit to within EU limits. .
