The Coalition government doesn\u2019t represent corporate Australia, he told a business gathering. The Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister accused business of pandering to noisy elitist political activists rather than delivering on the aspirations of the \u201chard-working middle and aspirational Australians\u201d who returned the government to power. As political editor Phillip Coorey exclusively foreshadowed last Saturday, Energy Minister Angus Taylor then reintroduced the Coalition\u2019s \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation to allow the government to break up integrated energy companies found to have rigged the market or gouged electricity consumers. Notwithstanding whimpers of protest from Liberal backbench dries, it started to look like an avalanche of new regulation promoted, ironically, by the assistant minister responsible for cutting red tape.\n\nThe business culture wars looked like escalating as the likes of Qantas boss Alan Joyce and BHP chief Andrew Mackenzie defended the role of business in various social causes and in combating climate change. The Millennials who turned out for Friday\u2019s climate change strike are not the \u201cquiet Australians\u201d whom Scott Morrison and Mr Morton want to reward for returning the Coalition to government. Nor are the activist shareholder investors who are becoming the new capitalist owners of corporate Australia.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison. The Coalition and business have been mending bridges. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nYet, amid this culture war distraction, the Coalition and big business ended the week closer as the emerging Middle East oil crisis added to the US-China trade war, Brexit and Hong Kong to unsettle investor confidence. Pitchfork culture wars and big-stick threats will make it harder for business to put investors' risk capital at work to grow the economy.\n\nBy Tuesday\u2019s meeting with the Business Council of Australia in Canberra, Mr Morton\u2019s rhetoric had shifted more behind this reality. Large companies were \u201ca vital part of our economy\u201d, he said. What was good for business was \u201cgood for all Australians\u201d. Mr Morton applauded the Business Council\u2019s \u201cStrong Australia\u201d campaign in regional Australia, praised its push for company tax cuts and backed its chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, for \u201chaving both policy consistency and the courage of your convictions\u201d. He highlighted a task force to reduce red tape, a push to get big infrastructure projects up and running sooner, and help for very small businesses to become first-time employers. Mr Morrison turned up to the Tuesday night dinner and worked the room. By Wednesday morning, even Labor leader Anthony Albanese acknowledged that business-bashing and Mr Shorten\u2019s politics of redistribution would not aid the cause of reviving productivity.\n\nBy announcing an end to a decade of Labor-initiated budget deficits, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg this week helped lay down a foundation of confidence that the Coalition has finally got the nation\u2019s finances in order without jacking up taxes. That provides the rare prospect of twin surpluses on the budget and balance of payments. If the budget surplus can be nailed down for the current financial year and beyond, then Mr Frydenberg could be placed to announce a well-crafted investment allowance in the May budget as a second-best alternative to a generalised company tax cut. This week\u2019s numbers show that while consumer spending remains soft, the labour market continues to generate solid job growth. Yet, as more Australians enter the job hunt, the unemployment rate edged up to 5.3 per cent \u2013 diverging from the Reserve Bank\u2019s new target of 4.5 per cent. Financial markets responded by pricing in a 70 per cent chance that the Reserve Bank will cut its official cash rate below 1 per cent at its October 1 meeting. Yet this will mostly squeeze bank margins, make bank lenders more risk averse and penalise the retiree savers who helped return the Coalition to office. It will only go to prove that the scope for demand-side stimulus has been all but exhausted and that the only alternative way to enrich Mr Morrison\u2019s quiet Australians is a burst of supply-side reforms that will encourage business to invest.", "description": "The Coalition and business ended the week closer amid all the culture war distractions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2044%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/017b37cd9c79f55306853100029b460dc83e7b9f", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
