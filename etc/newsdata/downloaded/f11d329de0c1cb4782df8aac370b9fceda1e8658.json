Trump has mostly been silent on Hong Kong. When he has mentioned it, he has explicitly linked the issues of trade and Hong Kong (even as his advisers dismiss any connection), warning the Chinese government that violent suppression of the protests would jeopardize trade talks and arguing that this threat is precisely what has restrained Beijing so far. At times Trump has appeared to take China\u2019s side, such as when he described the demonstrations as \u201criots.\u201d Occasionally he has said he\u2019s in favor of Hong Kong\u2019s freedom. More often he\u2019s suggested that the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, meet with protesters, an idea Xi hasn\u2019t shown the faintest indication of entertaining.\n\nRubio said he didn\u2019t believe Trump would veto the legislation to placate the Chinese as trade talks resume, noting that he thinks the bill will pass with a veto-proof majority. (The Trump administration has made such moves in the past, such as when it reportedly postponed a tough speech on China by Vice President Mike Pence ahead of trade talks between Trump and Xi at the G20 summit in June.)\n\n\u201cI think the bigger concern is in its implementation,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cYou can pass the bill, but it still requires the administration to implement it. It still requires them to conduct the annual review and it still requires them to impose sanctions on individuals, for example, police officials responsible for repression. They could theoretically sign the bill\u2014them or a future administration \u2014and yet not implement it.\u201d\n\nRubio added that he has made the argument to Trump \u201cthat if the Chinese are prepared to break the commitments they made on Hong Kong [as part of a 1984 agreement with Britain on transferring control of the territory to China], how could we trust them to keep any commitments they make on trade or any other matter?\u201d\n\nRead: Hong Kong\u2019s protests have cemented its identity\n\nIn Hong Kong, meanwhile, the bill is being championed by pro-democracy lawmakers and activists who have recently made trips to Washington to lobby for its passage, angering both pro-establishment figures in the territory and officials in Beijing.\n\nChina\u2019s oversight of Hong Kong has taken a \u201cserious deviation from the original intent of \u2018one country, two systems,\u2019\u201d Dennis Kwok, a member of the city\u2019s Legislative Council, told The Atlantic, referring to the framework under which Hong Kong has operated since 1997, when the territory was handed back to China. In August, Kwok and other Hong Kong lawmakers traveled to meet with U.S. counterparts in Montana, where the nonprofit that organized the delegation has an office.", "description": "Protests there have demonstrated the enduring appeal of American values and power.
