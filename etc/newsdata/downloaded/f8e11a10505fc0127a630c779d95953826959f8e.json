We are not satisfied that the [UK immigration rules] provide sufficient protection against disruption to family reunion routes.\"\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Neither the UK nor the EU should contemplate vulnerable people who have already experienced trauma facing additional suffering as a result of Brexit.\u201d\n\nIt came as Brandon Lewis, the immigration minister, warned that EU citizens who miss a 2021 deadline for applying to remain in the UK after Brexit could be deported.\n\nHe told German newspaper Die Welt: \u201cIf EU citizens have not registered by then without an adequate justification, the immigration rules will apply.\"", "description": "Vulnerable refugees face being separated from their families and the prospect of lengthy bureaucratic\u00a0delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a House of Lords committee has warned.
