(AP) - A newspaper investigation finds part of the American River in Sacramento contains high levels of E. coli bacteria, a sign of fecal contamination.\n\nThe Sacramento Bee says this week that E. coli was found along the lower stretch of the American, where homeless camps line the banks, residents walk their dogs, and swimmers dip into the water in the summer.\n\nThirteen out of 15 samples taken at a beach since June exceeded state and federal standards.\n\nLocal officials have begun a study that will test DNA of the bacteria to determine its exact source.\n\nThe newspaper says homeless encampments are proliferating, and there is a widespread lack of bathroom access in the area.\n\nBut the contamination also could be a result of geese excrement.\n\nE. coli can sometimes sicken people, with symptoms ranging from diarrhea to respiratory distress.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Sacramento Bee, http://www.sacbee.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A newspaper investigation finds part of the American River in Sacramento contains high levels of E. coli bacteria, a sign of fecal contamination.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
