He is coming off his least productive season and proved to be the odd-man out after Buffalo restocked the position this off-season.\n\nBuffalo signed 36-year-old Frank Gore and T.J. Yeldon in free agency and also used a third-round pick to draft Devin Singletary. McCoy was initially considered safe after general manager Brandon Beane twice said he was still considered the starter.\n\n'I'm the guy'\n\nThree weeks ago, McCoy expressed confidence he wasn't going anywhere.\n\n\"I've seen that,\" he said, referring to trade speculation. \"But for the last two years, people have been saying that. If that was the case, I would've been gone.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions over whether he had lost a step.\n\n\"I know who I am. I know how I play. And my teammates know that. So I mean, we'll see on Sundays,\" McCoy said. \"I'm the guy. I feel like that. That's what I've been told. And that's my every day approach.\"\n\nMcCoy was entering the final year of a five-year contract he signed after his acquisition in a trade with Philadelphia, where he led the NFL in yards rushing in 2013.\n\nMcCoy had an inconsistent four seasons with the Bills. He struggled in his first year in finishing with 895 yards rushing. McCoy attributed that to being unfocused as a result of being traded.\n\nHe responded by topping 1,100 yards rushing in each of his next two seasons. But he struggled last year when he finished with a career-worst 514 yards rushing and 752 yards from scrimmage.", "description": "The Buffalo Bills on Saturday released veteran running back LeSean McCoy just hours before NFL teams set their 53-player rosters, a move general manager Brandon Beane says was a tough decision but best for the team.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5266937.1567270331!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mccoy-lesean-190816-1180.jpg"}
