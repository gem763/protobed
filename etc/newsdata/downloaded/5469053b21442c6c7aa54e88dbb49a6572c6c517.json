The electronic vehicle licence is available on Android and iOS devices via the Service NSW app and can be downloaded free of charge.\n\nDoes it completely replace your plastic licence? Can you use it as a proof-of-age card? And what happens when you have no data? Here's everything you need to know.\n\nAfter successful trials in selected suburbs, New South Wales is bringing DDL to all driver licence holders statewide. While some testing is still underway, the Digital Driver Licence should be accessible to you right now.\n\nThere are several benefits to having a DDL on your phone. For starters, it allows changes to your licence - such as a new address or a licence renewal - to be updated in real time. It's also harder to steal due to inbuilt security protection from the Service NSW app.\n\nHere are the main things NSW drivers need to know about their electronic licence - including how to get it on your phone.\n\nWhat is the Digital Driver Licence (DDL)?\n\nAs its name suggests, the NSW Digital Driver Licence is a digital version of your NSW Driver Licence. It is available for all driver licence holders in NSW. The DDL is entirely optional and does not replace your existing, plastic licence.\n\nHow much does the Digital Driver Licence cost?\n\nAs mentioned above, the Digital Driver Licence is provided to NSW drivers at no additional cost. Hurrah!\n\nHow to download your NSW Digital Driver Licence\n\nThe NSW Digital Driver Licence is available via the Service NSW Mobile App. You can download it on most Android and iOS devices. To get your DDL, simply log into the app with your MyServiceNSW Account details and follow the prompts.\n\nNSW Digital Driver Licence for Android\n\nClick here.\n\nNSW Digital Driver Licence for iPhone\n\nClick here.\n\nHow is the Digital Driver Licence different to a regular licence?\n\nThe NSW Digital Driver Licence includes QR codes for law enforcement officials to scan your licence more quickly. Apart from that, it has all the same information you'd expect from the physical one you've had for years.\n\nCan the Digital Driver Licence be used for proof-of-age?\n\nYes. The NSW Digital Driver Licence is accepted by most licensed venues in Australia including bars, pubs, nightclubs and restaurants. You can also use it as a form of ID. (When checking into a hotel, for example.)\n\nHowever, be prepared for some initial confusion from licence checkers who might not be familiar with the rollout. As Service NSW notes on its website:\n\nIt may take some time before all organisations will be ready to accept the digital driver licence. In the meantime, we recommend you also carry your plastic card to avoid inconvenience.\n\nDo I still need to carry around my plastic driver licence?\n\nNo. You can legally drive without your plastic driver licence provided the DDL is accessible on your phone. This means your phone must be charged and have a screen that's clearly visible. (e.g. - not cracked.) With that said, it never hurts to have a backup in your wallet.\n\nCan you access your Digital Driver Licence while driving?\n\nNo. It\u2019s illegal to access your Digital Driver Licence when driving. This includes when your vehicle is stationary, unless you\u2019re asked to access it by a police officer. (Presumably, full licence holders may access their DDL if their phone is secured in an approved cradle, but don't quote us on that. We've reached out to Service NSW and will let you know when we learn more.)\n\nWhat about when there's no data coverage?\n\nProvided you're logged in, the Service NSW app is available for offline viewing. To access your digital driver licence, simply type in your PIN.", "description": "Service NSW today launched Australia's second Digital Driver Licence (DDL).
