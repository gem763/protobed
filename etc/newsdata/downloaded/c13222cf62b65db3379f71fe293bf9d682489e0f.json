(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe three authors are from different worlds. They have spent years at the top of their professions. The trio all meet questions with disarming candor.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, retired Marine Corps Gen. and former defense secretary Jim Mattis, and Microsoft President Brad Smith all have new books out, each of them rich in the perspective that authors gain from decades in positions of authority. I have interviewed the three men recently either on the radio or at events at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, Calif., or both. Even after interviewing tens of thousands of people over three decades, I was struck by these conversations and how vital they could be for understanding our growing national crisis.\n\nLet me sum up the conclusions that follow from having read these books by Gorsuch, Mattis and Smith and having spoken with their authors at length in the past month:\n\nPublic service is noble, but the nation\u2019s current politics are broken. The titanic change brought about by the Internet has completely transformed so much so quickly that we are only dimly aware of the massive collapse of all norms and approaches to human interaction. The United States is genuinely threatened by powerful enemies abroad and by a brittle, creaking body politic and vicious rhetoric at home.\n\nThe law endures, but not deep respect for the law. Some friendships across the political chasm endure, but some have fractured and many are under extraordinary stress. Venom is everywhere in public life, a desire to wound and embarrass as frequent a motive as that to bring together or earn a genuine laugh untainted by another\u2019s pain. And to repeat: Enemies of the United States are very real and would like nothing more than for our differences to become permanent divides and our disagreements the occasions for intramural violence.\n\nWe mistake the agent of these acids if we pinpoint individual political figures. Politics has never been beanbag, as the saying goes, and the actual words and deeds of the central players don\u2019t excuse or absolve individuals of agency for their actions. That has been the case throughout the nation\u2019s history, whether with the riots outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago even as hatred raged inside, or with the attack in 1856 on the Senate floor, amid irreconcilable differences over slavery, when Rep. Preston Brooks used his cane to brutally beat Sen. Charles Sumner. If you insult on Twitter, it\u2019s not because of President Trump or his counterparts. If you strike out wildly at opponents and their colleagues, families and friends, their provocation, large or small, doesn\u2019t justify your response if intemperate. If you are encouraging violence, even if using oh-so-subtle nudges, you own the blood.\n\nGorsuch, Mattis and Smith have in recent weeks traveled about the country appealing for \u2014 wait for it \u2014 civility. I was in junior high school when the 1960s rent the country, and voices calling for calm then were ineffective even when raised. I don\u2019t recall anyone other than Robert F. Kennedy on the night of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s murder who indelibly attempted to dial it down rather than up.\n\nIf back then there were individuals such as those we have today in Archbishop Charles Chaput in Philadelphia and Archbishop Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez in Los Angeles \u2014 religious leaders who could be considered both conservative tribunes of traditional values but also deeply and sincerely committed activists on behalf of the poor and immigrants \u2014 I don\u2019t recall them.\n\nAdults may have been perpetually on edge, with rage and violence rising as the Vietnam War divided the country, but everyday people in the lives of students who opposed the war didn\u2019t act like Yosemite Sam if he were facing off against Wile E. Coyote, which is much of online life today. Most of real life at the time \u2014 save for the 30 minutes of nightly TV news or the covers and content of the newsweeklies \u2014 was relatively pacific. \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d wouldn\u2019t have succeeded on Netflix.\n\nWhat will the politics of 2070 look like if the trend lines of rage and spittle from 1969 to 2019 continue? Sheep dip everyone under age 12 in this culture and project their behaviors 30 years out. The rule of law cannot blithely be assumed to endure. Our military cannot continue to protect us from our internal follies when funded on declining shares of gross domestic product. China, already in fact if not awareness, our better in total purchasing power parity, will soon surpass the United States by every measure of economic performance. The collapse of courtesy is already complete. How can a culture fall off a floor? We will find out soon enough.\n\nGo read Gorsuch\u2019s \u201cA Republic, If You Can Keep It,\u201d Mattis\u2019s \u201cCall Sign Chaos\u201d and Smith\u2019s \u201cTools and Weapons.\u201d Then ask yourself: Are you on the side of the angels?\n\nRead more:\n\nMichael Gerson: Civility doesn\u2019t just make our system function \u2014 it also makes it noble\n\nElizabeth Bruenig: The left and the right cry out for civility, but maybe that\u2019s asking for too much\n\nJoe Biden: Trump won\u2019t destroy me, and he won\u2019t destroy my family\n\nDavid Ignatius: For Trump, Ukraine is a story of personal resentment and political opportunism\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s corruption is black and white", "description": "Ask yourself: Are you on the side of the angels?", "authors": ["Hugh Hewitt", "October At Pm", "A Post Contributing Columnist", "Hosts A Nationally Syndicated Radio Show On The Salem Network.
