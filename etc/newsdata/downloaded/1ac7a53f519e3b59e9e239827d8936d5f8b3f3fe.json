Other women in the past have also got creative using their breasts.\n\nAnd who could forget Pricasso, the man who paints with his penis?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile he\u2019s painted many a politician and celeb, he hasn\u2019t ventured onto dear old Lizzie. But perhaps that could be considered treason.\n\nWho knew breasts doubled as paintbrushes (Picture: Nadia Matievskay/Caters)\n\nMeanwhile, Nadia loves giving a shout out to the monarchy and says there\u2019s even a growing demand for her work.\n\nShe said: \u2018I love what I do and I see why there\u2019s a demand.\n\n\u2018Of course, I realise that the way the paintings are created is what\u2019s attracting attention to my art and I but I want to keep on making my art as much as possible.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s difficult for me to say that I have a favourite painting. I love all of them.\u2019\n\nNeat talent (Picture: Nadia Matievskay/Caters)\n\nNadia said she had never picked up a paintbrush until she began painting her unique pieces back in February.\n\nShe now sells her art using Facebook and Instagram and flogs the stuff across the globe.\n\nThe budding Picasso says she picked up her unique style of painting while she was completing an acting course.\n\nShe said: \u2018One day our mission was to give each other some weird tasks.\n\n\u2018And my task was quite odd, to paint a picture with my breast and sell it. So, at the start, it was sort of just a joke.\n\n(Picture: Nadia Matievskay/Caters)\n\n\u2018I think my first experience was quite a success. It\u2019s hard to evaluate it from the point of view of a painting technique as not many people paint like this but the colour was quite nice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Since then I started to source the information and study the twists and turns of breast painting.\n\n\u2018Every painting has its own story and feelings which I try to transfer through my art.\u2019\n\nAnd another plus side \u2013 she gets to save money on aprons.\n\nMORE: Halloween boobs are back, so get the glitter and glue out\n\nMORE: Tattoo artist creates nipple tats to breast cancer survivors but the images keep getting deleted from Facebook\n\nMORE: Artist creates iconic optical illusion looks where she blends into the background\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Artist Nadia Matievskay from Minsk, Belarus, doesn't paint fruit bowls or nudes, she makes majestic illustrations of Her Majesty the Queen.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88795702_1570441448.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
