He downloaded the hour-long show in 3.6 seconds.\n\nKeyshawn never had a chance. Because Ricky was using Verizon\u2019s blazing, blistering, jaw-droppingly fast new cell network called 5G .\n\n5G Will Come Faster Than We Thought\n\nIf you feel like you\u2019ve been waiting forever for 5G to make its debut, you\u2019re not alone...\n\n5G is the most disruptive trend of this decade. Many readers have asked me: What\u2019s taking so long?\n\nProgress may feel slow because 5G phones aren\u2019t mainstream yet.\n\nBut 5G is actually coming online much faster than analysts predicted just two years ago. The next year or so will be a very, very exciting time to own the right 5G stocks.\n\nIn a minute, I\u2019ll give you a few of my top 5G stock picks.\n\nFirst, let me get you up to speed on all the exciting things happening in 5G.\n\nNFL Stadiums Have Turned into 5G Testing Grounds\n\nVerizon (NYSE: ) has launched its new 5G network in 13 NFL stadiums.\n\nAT&T (NYSE: ) brought its new 5G network to AT&T Stadium, where the Dallas Cowboys play.\n\nThe point is to make games more fun for fans.\n\nAt AT&T Stadium, for example, fans can participate in augmented reality (AR) experiences that were impossible before 5G.\n\nAR, if you\u2019re not familiar, overlays digital imagery on real life.\n\nIf you have a Samsung Galaxy S10 5G smartphone, for example, point the camera towards Cowboy stadium as you walk in. You\u2019ll see 36-foot tall digital versions of Dallas Cowboy players yelling chants to hype you up.\n\nOnce you\u2019re in the stadium, you can do a touchdown dance, and digital Dallas Cowboys will dance with you.\n\nYou can even dodge AR defensive robots on the field as you try to score a touchdown in a new mobile game.\n\nThese AR experiences require massive amounts of data to move extremely fast.\n\nNone of it is possible without 5G.\n\nChicago Has Turned into a 5G Testing Ground, Too\n\nVerizon launched its 5G network in parts of the city back in April. It was the first commercial launch of 5G in the world.\n\nA man named Danny Winget travelled around the city testing the network.\n\nThe download speeds he reported were incredible\u2026 10X faster than the fastest 4G connections.\n\nWhen fully deployed, the networks should reach peak speeds of 100X faster than 4G.\n\n5G Is Not Just About Download Speeds\n\nPatrick Holland, editor at CNET, recently tested AT&T\u2019s 5G network at the Shape conference in Los Angeles.\n\nHolland downloaded seven one-hour episodes of Blue Planet in under 17 seconds.\n\nIt took me the same amount of time to download just the first episode. And I was logged into my home high-speed broadband internet connection!\n\nBut 5G isn\u2019t just about virtually instant download speeds.\n\nSoon it will let you:\n\nAttend a meeting in New York as a hologram from the comfort of your home;\n\nGet around safely in a self-driving car\u2014even if you drank a little too much wine on date night;\n\nFor you surgeons reading this, you\u2019ll be able to operate on patients hundreds of miles away over a wireless network using robots.\n\nIn fact, the early stages of the 5G \u201cawakening\u201d are happening right now.\n\nThe average guy doesn\u2019t know it yet, because you don\u2019t see 5G phones on the street yet. But look at all the quiet progress that\u2019s been made in the last few months...\n\nAll of the big four wireless carriers in the US\u2014Verizon (NYSE: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ: ), and Sprint (NYSE: )\u2014have launched 5G in certain parts of the country.\n\nVerizon has rolled out 5G to parts of 11 US cities. T-Mobile\u2019s in six cities, Sprint\u2019s in nine, and AT&T is in parts of 21 cities.\n\nMany more rollouts are planned for next year.\n\nMeanwhile, the first 5G phones have hit the US market. There\u2019s the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, the LG V50 ThinQ 5G, and the Motorola Moto Z4 and Z3 5G.\n\nPlus, Apple (NASDAQ: ) recently paid $1 billion to acquire \u201cthe majority\u201d of Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business.\n\nThe acquisition means Apple is well on its way to producing its own 5G smartphone modems.\n\nIndustry insiders expect the company to launch its first 5G iPhone next year.\n\n5G is coming online outside the US, too.\n\nDeutsche Telecom and Vodafone (LON: ) are deploying 5G in parts of Europe. And China\u2019s state-owned carriers expect to have 5G up and running in 50 cities by the end of this year.\n\nWhat Does All This Mean for You?\n\nWell, it means faster phone speeds and a lot of exciting new technologies that will make your life easier.\n\nBut it also means this is an incredible time to invest.\n\nTo make money in 5G, look into:\n\nWireless service providers like Verizon (NYSE: ) and AT&T (NYSE: )\n\nSmartphone and tablet makers like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) Electronics (OTC: )\n\nNetwork gear makers like Ericsson (NASDAQ: ) and Nokia (NYSE: )\n\nChipmakers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: )\n\nOr, if you\u2019re comfortable taking a bit more risk for potentially massive profits, look at smaller disruptive companies that are making 5G possible.\n\nMy favorite \u201csubsector\u201d is companies that manufacture tiny components needed for all 5G phones called \u201cRF filters.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re going to need hundreds of billions more RF filters as 5G rolls out. And the small companies that have the best technology on the market stand to make a killing.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Stephen McBride covering: AT&T Inc, Vodafone Group PLC, Qualcomm Incorporated, Apple Inc.
