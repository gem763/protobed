The committee is also asking for documents pertaining to any pardon promises for immigration officials or others engaged in trying to build Trump\u2019s southern border barrier.\n\n\u201cThe dangling of pardons by the president to encourage government officials to violate federal law would constitute another reported example of the president\u2019s disregard for the rule of law,\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \u201cThe Framers did not envision the use of the presidential pardon power to encourage criminal acts at the president\u2019s direction.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe news comes just days after The Washington Post reported that Trump is so eager to build hundreds of miles of border fence ahead of his reelection that he has directed aides to fast-track billions of dollars\u2019 worth of construction contracts, aggressively seize private land and disregard environmental rules, according to current and former officials involved with the project.\n\nHe then told subordinates concerned about legal repercussions that he will pardon them of any potential wrongdoing should they have to break laws to follow his orders.\n\nIn response, the White House said Trump is joking when he makes such statements about pardons.\n\n\u2018Take the land\u2019: President Trump wants a border wall. He wants it black. And he wants it by Election Day.\n\nEarlier this year, the New York Times and CNN reported that Trump told acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan that he would pardon him if he was jailed for denying entry to migrants seeking asylum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe document requests, Democrats are promising, will be followed up with hearings as the party determines whether to impeach the president. Judiciary Democrats have discussed drafting articles of impeachment this fall and said in a release that Trump\u2019s talk of pardons fits squarely into their inquiry into \u201cabuse of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the committee continues its investigation into whether to recommend articles of impeachment, it is imperative that we are able to obtain information about ongoing presidential misconduct and abuses of power,\u201d Nadler said in the statement.\n\nAD", "description": "The House Judiciary Committee is seeking all documents referencing a promise of presidential pardons for aides carrying out Trump\u2019s immigration policies.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JQDosc6MrFWnEYzAm0APJ5ROdpI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OHSGM5WPLUI6TMU3UUUNZAQVJI.jpg"}
