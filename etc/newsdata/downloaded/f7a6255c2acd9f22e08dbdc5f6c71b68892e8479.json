He is not running in the 2020 campaign.\n\nHe said people he met along the campaign trail were skeptical of the Transhumanist pitch, but argued that people underestimate how quickly technology is advancing.\n\nOne of my new presidential campaign posters: <a href=\"https://t.co/LMkYdTyene\">https://t.co/LMkYdTyene</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Transhumanism?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Transhumanism</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Future?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Future</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/POTUS?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#POTUS</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImmortalityBus?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ImmortalityBus</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/1NyemY6MkW\">pic.twitter.com/1NyemY6MkW</a> \u2014@zoltan_istvan\n\nHe told The Current's Laura Lynch that \"almost every single action that a human does, a machine can almost certainly do dramatically better.\"\n\n\"When you talk about running a country, you talk about governing for the greatest good,\" Istvan said. \"A machine is going to have better algorithms.\"\n\nHe added that one benefit of robot leaders would be that they could improve over time, weeding out idiosyncrasies or issues experienced by previous iterations.\n\nA robot programmed to lead wouldn't necessarily be stuck behind a desk on Parliament Hill \u2014 it could be artificial intelligence that you could access anywhere, like a smart speaker in your living room.\n\nThe implication for democracy would be that \"in the future, an AI will be able to keep on millions and millions of close relationships with its voters base,\" Istvan said.\n\nIt \"might be campaigning right in your living room,\" he added.\n\n\"That's where this becomes really interesting, is a really direct relationship with a potential AI political leader.\"\n\nFuturist Zoltan Istvan argues that a robot leader would be able to communicate directly with voters, even answering direct questions and 'campaigning right in your living room.'
