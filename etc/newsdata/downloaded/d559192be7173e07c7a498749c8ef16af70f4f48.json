(I love that for her, because the absolute last thing I would ask Kendall for is a dick pic.) The rest of the episode doesn\u2019t match the gleeful debauchery of that moment, but it\u2019s still plenty dramatic: Logan and Rhea are fucking; the kids appeal to their mother, Caroline; and things are heating up around the cruises malfeasance. Now that the Pierce deal is completely closed, we\u2019re back to square one on the takeover effort, but with even more moving parts now in play. Stewy and Sandy exploit the suspicious cater-waiter death last season, and lawyers are opening the books to see what exactly went down in the cruise department. Here\u2019s where our demented first family (and a potential usurper?) stands after \u201cReturn.\u201d\n\nBlanche and Partners\n\nTom expected the company\u2019s inquiry into the cruise drama to be like a bubble bath. Instead it was like pulling teeth; he struggled to answer even relatively straightforward questions. The lawyers from Blanche weren\u2019t asking him anything complicated \u2014 they just asked him if he knew of any destroyed documents, which, of course he does. These two nerds digging around cruises is dangerous for everyone, and it could even fuck up the takeover bid. If this were Game of Thrones \u2014 and thank God it\u2019s not \u2014 then cruises would be an existential threat on par with the White Walkers.\n\nCousin Greg\n\nWe\u2019ll get to the document stuff in a minute, but first I need to get to the bottom of this: When Tom shows up at Greg\u2019s apartment to threaten to break his legs, Greg has people over. It\u2019s not a casual dinner party or just friends hanging out \u2014 they\u2019re sipping wine and dressed in office wear. \u201cWelcome to the next wave!\u201d a woman says, greeting Tom. Is Greg (-ory) up to something? Is he planning some kind of coup? With the support of the Royco proletariat, could he get himself promoted even higher?\n\nNow, the document stuff: Gregory you menace! Not only does he have audio, but he has some of the incriminating papers. He has a lot of cards to play now, even with Logan if he wants. The cruises information is the biggest internal wild card, so I really think he could leverage this power for basically anything.\n\nRhea Jarrell\n\nI thought that \u201cArgestes\u201d was the last we\u2019d see of Ms. Rhea Jarrell, but fear not! She\u2019s back and permanently attached to Logan\u2019s side. The thing about Rhea is that I love her but I also can\u2019t stand her. She\u2019s so slippery! In The Maltese Falcon, Humphrey Bogart has this great line when Peter Lorre tells him that he always seems to have an explanation, an easy answer. \u201cWhat do you want me to do \u2014 learn to stutter?\u201d he asks. That\u2019s Rhea! Now that she\u2019s fired from PGM, she\u2019s whispering leading questions and explanations in Logan\u2019s ear. On the jet to Europe, she lays out why every kid is wrong for the top job (Shiv thinks she\u2019s smarter than she actually is, Roman is too green, and Kendall is too scared), and then later in the night during her fireside chat with Logan, she invents a solution: She\u2019ll sniff around and help him see who\u2019s best.\n\nI\u2019m obsessed with the way Holly Hunter doesn\u2019t play Rhea as vicious. She is silently calculating, but none of it looks premeditated. She has this unknowable Cheshire cat quality that makes her dangerous \u2014 and high on this ranking. Her motive seems to just be to consolidate her own power, and also to sleep with Logan in the process. She\u2019s too good to just be an affair, though, and I doubt she\u2019d settle for just that. She\u2019s either taking the company or the last name.\n\nCaroline Collingwood\n\nCaroline is obviously bitter that her three children have chosen their father over her, but not too bitter to pass up using them as collateral in a negotiation with Logan. The former Mrs. Roy is so duplicitous, she might as well be a Julia Roberts\u2013Clive Owen crime caper from 2009! I like that Succession lays out her deficiencies here: She\u2019s unbothered by her children, and unavailable to them. Even if Logan engages out of anger or manipulation, he still gives them attention. Caroline gives them a nasty-looking hen and then goes to bed early. Of course these kids are fucked up!\n\nLogan Roy\n\nThis is a great Logan episode \u2014 in the same scene, basically in the same breath, he can be gleeful and conspiratorial and impossible to read. \u201cI can take care of myself,\u201d he tells Kendall, when he\u2019s asked about his relationship with Rhea. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s cunt-struck.\u201d That line alone sent me to therapy!\n\nIncreasingly this season, we\u2019re seeing Logan squirm. He was vulnerable at the Pierce dinner, and was vulnerable when he tried to convince Nan at Argestes that it was still a good deal. Over scotch with Rhea, he confesses that he\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s going to do: \u201cWith Kendall, it wasn\u2019t the best situation. Maybe I should just say fuck it, and let her do it. I don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 know,\u201d he says. Of course Rhea offers some counsel to help him wiggle out of promising Shiv the company, but his grip is so tight.\n\nShiv Roy\n\nWhat can Shiv do right this season? What a lunch she has with Rhea \u2014 these long-bob meetings are always a treat! Rhea asks for permission to sleep with Logan, and then dangles the prospect of working for PGM in front of Shiv. Shiv takes the bait, but it\u2019s a trap Rhea has set only to get Logan to see through his daughter. Is Shiv really out-out now? She doesn\u2019t have a cushy political job, doesn\u2019t have an offer from Nan, and doesn\u2019t have her father\u2019s promise anymore. I almost want Shiv to decamp, just to show her dad what he\u2019s missing. A word of advice to my daughter, Siobhan: If you find yourself wanting to do something, do the opposite of that thing.\n\nAs for Rhea \u2014 you\u2019re in danger, girl.\n\nTom Wamsgans\n\nI love Tom. I do! I can\u2019t help myself. (Blame Pride and Prejudice, I think?) Tom talks Greg into destroying the cruise blackmail \u2014 a victory \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t know that even Greg will take out an extra insurance policy in case the lawyers come sniffing around his role in it all. As long as the investigation into all the fucked-up stuff that went on in cruises is ongoing, Tom\u2019s not safe. With Shiv out in the cold, he\u2019s not even savable. I believe that Shiv loves Tom and relies on him more than she (or anyone else) thinks she does, but if it comes down to burning him to save herself, she\u2019d do it.\n\nRoman Roy\n\nI think I was too hard on Roman last week. I was tired from TIFF and feeling grumpy. (Are Logan and I really apologizing to Roman in the same episode? Imagine that!) A Roman-Gerri dream ticket is pretty feasible \u2014 Logan likes Roman\u2019s chaotic energy, and he trusts Gerri. But I have to wonder: with Rhea cozying up to Logan, does that sideline Gerri? Or does that sideline Marcia?\n\nNaomi Pierce\n\nNaomi asked for a dick pic and Kendall sent her one! Success. But it\u2019s still a dick pic from Kendall, which I really cannot imagine being impressed by.\n\nKendall Roy\n\nKendall has been sitting pretty for the last couple of episodes \u2014 a little too pretty, maybe. He gets a little too big for his britches this week, even teasing Logan about his relationship with Rhea. Obviously that doesn\u2019t go over well. When Sandy stirs up drama with the parents of Kendall\u2019s Chappaquiddick, Logan uses it as an opportunity to remind his son who\u2019s boss. Poor Kendall, having to tag along as his dad atones for his sins. All he wanted to do was strong-arm his mom and kiss Naomi! Instead he\u2019s sitting in the kitchen of the guy he accidentally killed. It\u2019s a pitiful, devastating scene, but also Kendall is back in his dad\u2019s pocket. He doesn\u2019t have any cards to play.\n\nFuck Off of the Week\n\nThe last position on this list is reserved for the Fuck Off of the Week. What happened to my favorite Roy family tradition? There wasn\u2019t a good \u201cfuck off\u201d this episode, although I did quite enjoy Roman flipping off Shiv at dinner with their mother.", "description": "Logan and Rhea are hooking up, the kids appeal to their mother Caroline, and things are heating up around the cruises malfeasance.
