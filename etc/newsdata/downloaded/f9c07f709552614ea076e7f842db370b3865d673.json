Cherrypicking a few of them out of context is neither useful nor connected to my current position,\" he said.\n\nThe news outlet reported that in a 1992 Heritage Foundation lecture, Pendley denied that there was a hole in the ozone layer and compared environmentalism to communism.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"'Environmentalism' is indeed the last refuge of the left, the last safe haven for those who trust, not the people, but big government, those who seek to place the power in the hands of federal bureaucrats,\" he said. \"It should not surprise us that they have embraced environmentalism with the same self-righteous fervor as they once embraced socialism and communism.\"\n\n\"Despite the total absence of credible scientific evidence, the media is convinced and is attempting to convince us that we have global warming, an Ozone hole and acid rain and that it is all man's fault,\" he also said.\n\nThe news network also found a 2011 press release in which Pendley said that \"public support for the fiction of man-made climate change\" was \"at an all time low.\"\n\nCNN reported that he \"repeatedly\" pushed anti-Muslim beliefs, including by tweeting an article by anti-Muslim activist Robert Spencer.\n\n\"Who knew? Islam's war with America started just up the road in Greeley, Colorado!\" he reportedly tweeted with the article.\n\nCNN also found that Pendley compared undocumented immigrants to cancer and claimed spread disease.\n\n\"The problems Hazleton or Valley Park faces could be in your community next because illegal immigration is spreading like a cancer,\" he reportedly wrote in a 2007 fundraising mailer for his legal fund. \"Partly this is because Mexico and some other governments promote and encourage illegal immigration into our country.\"\n\nCNN also found that Pendley wrote in a 2006 blog post , \"Violent crime\u2014including dangerous gangs, over-crowded schools, the appearance of diseases once vanquished from the western world, escalating hospital costs, and an overwhelming demand for government services!\"\n\n\"These are the new problems being faced by small, cash-strapped cities and towns all across America.
