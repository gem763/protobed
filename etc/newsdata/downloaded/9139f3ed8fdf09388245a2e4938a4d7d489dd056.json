The time varies, but what is normally needed is between eight and 120 hours of commitment from the person, although some are considerably longer. Today, many short courses are offered online, but there remains an ongoing interest in those that are presented face-to-face in groups because it is hard to match the interaction, collaboration and networking achieved this way.\n\nIn a recent review of the short courses that continue to attract enrolments on a face-to-face basis, the Independent Institute of Education\u2019s key providers of short courses \u2013 Vega School and the Business School at Varsity College \u2013 confirmed that most students enrolled with the aim to ensure their skills were up to date and immediately applicable in the workplace, as it improved their career prospects.\n\nThere is a direct correlation between the demand for short courses and the corporate world\u2019s demand that staff quickly take up a new role or responsibility. This is where short courses come into their own, as they give ambitious people what they need when they need it in an immediately implementable way.\n\nThere is no doubt that short courses are very much focused on career progression and new skills, and that few people have the personal resources or can get funded by their employers for \u201cvanity courses\u201d solely focused on personal growth. This is because of the state of the economy, but also because of the rapidly changing demands in the world of work.\n\nEmployers reward staff and seek new candidates who can demonstrate that they have achieved a solid grounding in a specific niche field, and that they are able to perform specific duties from the beginning.\n\nBoosting your career or getting a foot in the door doesn\u2019t always require full-time study over several years. Short courses are therefore a fantastic option for those people who need to upskill or wide-skill within a limited time; whose time to study is limited; or who need to demonstrate that they can meet a business need right away.\n\nThe most popular short courses at the moment are:\n\nBusiness management\n\nShort courses in business management remain very popular with those individuals who are progressing up the ladder at work and feel the need for a sound and quick exposure to key functional areas of responsibility for managers.\n\nMany may go on to acquire more formal education or may already have a foundation that they are consolidating, but there is a strong correlation between workplace opportunities and enrolment in this short course.\n\nMarketing management\n\nIn a tough economic environment, many existing managers and others recognise the potential that an ability to analyse and solve marketing challenges gives to achieving strategic advantage for business and for themselves.\n\nSmall business owners understand the need to market effectively, but do not always know how. Finally, those with a sales background find that a foundation in marketing is an effective way to increase their value to employers and enhance their earnings.\n\nProject management\n\nGiven the complexity of virtually all environments, project management methodology continues to gain traction as a core competency for those who want to help move a company forward effectively and efficiently. There is broad recognition these days that project management is a skill set that can be taught and, if applied well, can result in success in difficult situations.\n\nIt is not surprising that this course, which gives core skills to those who are required to plan and complete projects in time and on budget, continues to be one of the most popular.\n\nSupply chain and logistics management\n\nEver more managers understand that logistics and supply chains can make or break a growing business, so the demand for training in this core function continues to grow.\n\nBrand management in a digital world\n\nIt is equally not at all surprising that several of the institute\u2019s short courses that embrace technology for improved effectiveness are experiencing a surge in enrolments. These include short courses in digital brand strategy, desktop publishing and design, web design, copywriting for brands and gamification in brand building, as well as strategic brand leadership.\n\nCompanies that do not embrace these opportunities find that their grow will stall, while ever more people in small, medium and large businesses want the skills to manage their own brands in a digital world.\n\nKriel is general manager of the Independent Institute of Education, SA\u2019s largest and most accredited private higher education provider", "description": "Short courses gain popularity as career-minded people seek to boost their prospects, and those who want to study but are unable to do so full time take advantage of the brief commitment, explains education expert Peter Kriel.", "authors": ["Peter Kriel"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9190/d4a8a0df32cd42aa854f3cb509c2e199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-11"}
