Silverman previously hosted and executive-produced the late-night show I Love You, America on Hulu, which was canceled in January. But Silverman is returning unfettered to our TV screens with a new late-night show, which she says will consist of \u201cweighing in on the mishegas of the week and taking live video calls.\u201d This is a much different and less-specific premise than I Love You, America, which focused on spotlighting people on different sides of the political spectrum. Expanding on her new show\u2019s premise, Silverman says, \u201cI\u2019m as passionate talking about my face-washing routine as I am talking about why billionaires cost us money. Nothing\u2019s off the table and nothing\u2019s too high or low brow for me. I mean, look at my face, I\u2019m literally all brow.\u201d This is as compelling a logline as any we\u2019ve heard.
