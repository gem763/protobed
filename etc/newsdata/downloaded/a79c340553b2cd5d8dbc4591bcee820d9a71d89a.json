It happens to be one of the most beautiful cities in northern Italy, and you\u2019ll be hearing a lot more about it now British Airways has started flying there as a gateway to Milan, some 30 miles to the south-west.\n\nIt\u2019s dramatically divided into two parts, the walled Citt\u00e0 Alta, or Upper City, a Unesco World Heritage Site towering hundreds of feet above the lower town, Citt\u00e0 Bassa. Citta Alta has only 3,000 inhabitants, dates from Roman times and was later ruled by Milan and Venice.\n\nIts rich history is reflected in the Medieval and Renaissance buildings, and there is not a single chain outlet or souvenir shop. A bus will take you there from the airport in around 20 minutes.\n\nClassical drama: The Piazza Vecchia in hilltop Bergamo, some 30 miles south-west of Milan\n\nThere is so much to see \u2014 including the quaint main square, Piazza Vecchia, dominated by the huge white Palladian library, once the town hall, at one end, and the Venetian Palazzo della Ragione, a former centre of government, at the other.\n\nNearby is the 15th-century Colleoni Chapel, the remarkably embellished mausoleum of Bartolomeo Colleoni, the local boy who became a feared mercenary general. Next door is the magnificent basilica, as much a museum as a church. It makes the 17th-century cathedral a few feet away, with its bright, uplifting interior, seem like a poor relation.\n\nTake the lift up the city\u2019s bell tower, with the largest bell in the region, for superb views of the surroundings: Milan\u2019s skyscrapers in the distance across the plain towards the south; the valley and foothills of the Alps to the north.\n\nFor even better views, take the funicular up the hill of San Vigilio above the old town. There, you will find the Art Deco villas of the wealthy and a 12th-century castle.\n\nBergamo also has many good restaurants, serving specialities including the staple carb polenta, often flavoured, in many forms, and casoncelli pasta \u2014 a kind of twisted ravioli that ends up looking like a wing nut.\n\nTry them at Sant\u2019Ambroeus in Piazza Vecchia or DaMimmo, housed in a 14th-century building with a large terrace.\n\nLovely as the old city is, don\u2019t ignore the broad, leafy boulevards and grand buildings of the mostly 19th-century lower city \u2014 reached by funicular.\n\nAll the main roads are designed to radiate out from the old town, so that it always dominates the skyline. There are bustling shopping streets, such as Via Tasso, and cafes such as Balzer, in the elegant Sentierone area, founded in 1850.\n\nBergamo's rich history is reflected in the Medieval and Renaissance buildings, and there is not a single chain outlet or souvenir shop\n\nIt\u2019s opposite the opera house and famous for its sponge cake studded with dried fruit celebrating composer Gaetano Donizetti, who was born in Bergamo and has an annual festival dedicated to his work.\n\nAbove all, visit the Carrara art gallery, one of the country\u2019s best, for an overview of Italian art. And don\u2019t miss the Baroque church of Santi Bartolomeo e Stefano, with a heavily decorated interior and an altarpiece by Lorenzo Lotto. It\u2019s worth staying at least a few days, and the most glamorous choice is the Relais San Lorenzo, arranged around a courtyard, with a large panoramic terrace.\n\nIts restaurant, Hostaria, where you eat among Roman ruins, is one of the best in town.\n\nNow is the time to get to Bergamo \u2014 before the secret\u2019s out, the crowds come flooding in and the souvenir shops start opening.", "description": "British Airways has started flights to Bergamo, some 30 miles south-west of Milan.
