First, the trend is toward escalation, not de-escalation. Second, the cost of the uncertainty accumulates as time goes on without resolution, weighing on both the domestic and global economies,\" they said in a note to clients.\n\nA rocky August sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 1.7%, the S&P 500 1.8% lower and the Nasdaq Composite down by 2.6%.\n\nIn currency markets, both the euro and British pound came under pressure amid weak readings of manufacturing output, as well as heightened tensions over the possibility of a no-deal U.K. exit from the European Union.\n\nAhead of a raft of U.S. economic data this week, one positive sign came as the Caixin China manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose above the 50 mark for the first time in three months. But the official Chinese manufacturing PMI fell slightly to 49.5.\n\nRelated:The chief barrier to a trade-war induced economic shock is the best labor market in years (link)\n\nOverseas, the Shanghai Composite rose while the Hang Seng fell amid continued unrest in Hong Kong. The Stoxx Europe 600 edged higher.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 02, 2019 11:56 ET (15:56 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
