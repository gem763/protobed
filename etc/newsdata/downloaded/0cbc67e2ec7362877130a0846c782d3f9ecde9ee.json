[PARK SANG-MOON]\n\nSebastian Kind, the Argentinian government\u2019s renewable energies and energy efficiency undersecretary since 2016, stressed that renewable energy is not a choice but a necessity and that global investment is crucial.\u201cInstead of just paying $200-300 per megawatt hour, if you can pay [in the] $50 range in a couple of months, are you going to say no to that?\u201d Kind asked during an interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily on Thursday.\u201c[Renewable energy] in terms of clean energy production, which is fantastic of course, environmentally speaking, has greater benefits including mobilizing a lot of jobs, mobilizing high tech industries, mobilizing science and technology development and research and development, and it mobilizes industries. So is humanity ready to say no to that? I think it\u2019s too cruel to just rely on what we\u2019re used to, which is the use of fossil fuel.\u201dKind is one of the world\u2019s leading professionals in renewable energy, starting his career at BP\u2019s renewable energy department in London, and was elected as the International Renewable Energy Agency\u2019s council chairman in 2018.He was one of 3,000 government officials, industry officials and energy academics that gathered in Seoul to attend the International Renewable Energy Conference held for three days at Coex, southern Seoul, last week.The Argentinian energy undersecretary is behind the master plan to transition the South American country from fossil fuel dependent to the world\u2019s leader in renewable energy by raising the share of renewable energy to 20 percent of all of the country\u2019s power supply by 2025 through the renewable energy auction program RenovAr, which includes long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).\u201cThere are two ways for contracting RenovAr. One is RenovAr and another is corporate PPA,\u201d Kind said. \u201cSo together [between 2016 and 2019] we have roughly 6.5 gigawatts awarded in projects. Five gigawatts are already either in operation or under construction,\u201d he said.A roughly $7.5 billion investment is committed to the government awarded renewable energy projects. \u201cBut still there\u2019s 1.4 gigawatts in the pipeline,\u201d he added.Thanks to RenovAr, Argentina ranked ninth on the latest Ernst & Young\u2019s Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index. Korea ranked 24th, slightly up from 31st place thanks to the Moon Jae-in government\u2019s 3020 plan, which aims to raise the renewable energy share to 20 percent by 2030.Kind said Argentina\u2019s 20 percent goal is \u201cabsolutely achievable.\u201d\u201cLast Sunday, Argentina\u2019s [renewable energy] peaked at 14 percent,\u201d Kind said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a huge trend and the steepness of the slope, going up in the cooperation of new capacity is high.\u201dKind said renewable energy in the last five to 10 years has a huge increase in available technology, particularly for solar energy.\u201cAnd that\u2019s thanks to the drop in prices,\u201d Kind said. \u201cSolar [in particularly] has seen prices drop 19 percent in the last six to seven years which is provoking massive deployment worldwide.\u201cRenewable energy is the most unsubsidized, most convenient [energy] source, in most of the economies.\u201dKind said he is currently working on expanding the RenovAr program into a global platform, which he dubs the Global Renewable Energy Mass Adoption Program, or Green Map.He said the program is particularly targeted toward emerging economies that do not have access to the international finances that are crucial in drawing up long-term renewable energy plans.\u201cWe can divide the world into countries that have access to the international capital market and those that do not have access for whatever reason - political, stability or fiscal instability or whatever - risk is associated [with] those economies,\u201d Kind said. \u201cRenewable is a capital intensive industry.\u201dKind said developed economies like Europe, Korea, the United States, Australia, Japan and Canada find it much easier to secure global investment.\u201cWhen we jump to [the] rest of the world, which is half of the world like my country or many countries in Southeast Asia or countries in Latin America and Africa, we always face the bottleneck of financing - capital is not keen to flow into these markets thanks to, or due to, risks associated with their economies,\u201d Kind said.\u201cSo to shield the program in emerging markets [from] the market risk and put it in the capital market is key to promoting renewables. Green Map is a platform that is [aiming to] replicate the benefits of what we have done in Argentina but globally to other emerging economies.\u201dIn fact, Argentina was able to get $730 million in partial project guarantees from the World Bank through its RenovAr.Kind said the backstop of the World Bank not only provided benefits as a financial instrument but also more importantly the recognition and the seal of approval from a multinational institution.\u201cThe World Bank is telling the world that this is something the international capital market should [pay] attention to,\u201d Kind said.He said the energy industry is a multibillion dollar industry, and that there are huge opportunities for Korea as well.No Korean company has directly participated in Argentina\u2019s renewable energy projects as of yet, including financial institutions.\u201cThere are some [Korean] part suppliers,\u201d Kind said. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s a faraway market and of course that\u2019s a natural barrier for companies and investment,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the world is quite global already so we should go global to understand how to [create] opportunities.\u201dDuring his visit to Seoul last week, Kind met with several officials at Korea Electric Power Corporation and the leading Korean solar company, Hanwha Q Cells.\u201cI\u2019m here in Seoul to speak with authorities and to foster that confidence in the community here,\u201d he said.BY LEE HO-JEONG [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/28200518.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
