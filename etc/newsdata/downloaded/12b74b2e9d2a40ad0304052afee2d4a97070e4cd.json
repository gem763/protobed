And she was not judging me. She was just so supportive and funny at the same time.'\n\nFriends: 'I think she saw a free spirit who had the license to be, in a rock and roll kind of way, loose as a goose. And I could smoke a joint if I wanted to,' said Simon\n\nThe singer, 74, says that it was her friend's bracing, and at times brutal, honesty that she most valued over the years.\n\n'She gave me advice like nobody else did,' remembers Simon.\n\n'Other people would be too nervous to tell me what they really thought about certain things...But Jackie was forthright.'\n\nJackie was also 'really interested' in Simon's life after the two were introduced by John F Kennedy Jr in a Martha's Vineyard restaurant.\n\n'I think she saw in me something that she wanted to have a little bit of herself,' writes Simon.\n\n'I think she saw a free spirit who had the license to be, in a rock and roll kind of way, loose as a goose. And I could smoke a joint if I wanted to.'", "description": "Jackie Kennedy is every bit the doting grandmother in a never-before-seen photo of the former first lady with her three grandchildren that has been shared by Carly Simon.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/17/20044270-0-image-a-28_1571762220042.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
