But critics overlook a key part of their appeal: They have channeled serious money to voters in the name of shoring up the \u201cfamily values\u201d they say are under siege from secular Europe. These parties, such as PiS and Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, in Hungary, have found electoral success by combining a right-wing vision of society with state largesse. The Family 500+ program in particular, with its catchy title, neat round number, and wide reach, has become a model for other countries in the region, where declining birth rates and immigration of native-born citizens to more prosperous European countries have sparked demographic panic.\n\nHere in Poland, the program has proved intoxicating for large swaths of the population, one that helped garner PiS a decisive parliamentary victory in elections yesterday, winning over not just conservative Catholics, but an array of more unlikely fans, including leftists who felt that PiS, by favoring a model typically eschewed by right-wing parties, offered a compelling critique of a rigged system that left workers vulnerable to the predations of international and local elites.\n\n\u201cThey were listening to people like me; they were reading Thomas Piketty,\u201d says Rafa\u0142 Wo\u015b, a columnist for the socialist Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny, referring to the French economist whose agenda-setting book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, argues that wealth could continue to concentrate in the hands of the rich. The book was endorsed by the PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczy\u0144ski in 2015.\n\nThe program\u2019s design\u2014free money, no strings attached\u2014is similar to a universal basic income, and marks a sharp departure from the paternalistic attitude of previous governments, which viewed poor families as \u201cincapable of being in charge of their own money,\u201d says Tomasz Inglot, a political scientist at Minnesota State University who studies welfare states in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe universality of the program has even won it grudging plaudits from some feminists, most of whom hold otherwise dim views of the government, which tried to outlaw abortion in 2016 and routinely depicts feminism as a form of \u201cgender ideology\u201d that is poisoning Poland\u2019s traditional values. Agnieszka Graff, a writer, feminist, and professor at the University of Warsaw, notes that Family 500+ recognizes the economic value of caregiving, an acknowledgment that, ironically, could give women more power within their households, even as it may discourage them from joining the formal labor market. At the same time, the program reinforces traditional values that still resonate widely among the country\u2019s conservative voters.", "description": "The country\u2019s governing party, which just won another election, has married right-wing social policy with left-wing economic policy.", "authors": ["Anna Louie Sussman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19283734376198/facebook.jpg?1570973775", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
