However, they are essential to our understanding of international relations. Few people have read them more closely than the historian and strategist Jonathan D.T. Ward. In his new book, China\u2019s Vision of Victory, Ward combines Chinese work reports, propaganda editorials, nationalist films, and everyday conversations to present a uniquely comprehensive snapshot of China\u2019s worldview and plans. This important book belongs on the shelf of every student of China.\n\nWard, who has lived in China extensively and conducted research in rarely-accessed Chinese archives while reading for an Oxford University doctorate, argues the key to understanding China\u2019s worldview is the vision of the \u201cGreat Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation.\u201d[2] China is not merely trying to rise; it hopes to return to what Chinese leaders see as its rightful place as a large, prosperous, and powerful country, a place it occupied for much of what they call their \u201c5,000-year history.\u201d[3] Through a close reading of Chinese statements, Ward provides a unique account of Chinese ambitions. In contrast to many other recent books on China, such as Elizabeth Economy\u2019s The Third Revolution, which emphasizes the role of increasingly dictatorial Chinese President Xi Jinping, Ward argues China\u2019s dedication to the \u201cresurrection\u201d of its position as a preeminent global power has its roots in the early twentieth century.[4] Chinese revanchist nationalism pre-dates communism and had its first significant expressions in the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and the May Fourth Movement of 1919, early Chinese attempts to overcome Western dominance. (The Communists still commemorate both anti-Western revolutions).[5] The founder of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Mao Zedong, was not the originator of, but rather an heir to, the Chinese revolutionary tradition that was always tied to China\u2019s vision of a return to its rightful place, according to Ward.[6] Xi Jinping\u2019s contemporary Chinese nationalism is likewise \u201ca return to the founding principles of modern China.\u201d[7]\n\nThis unique account of Chinese nationalism and its central place in China\u2019s resurgence is one of the book\u2019s greatest strengths. It may also prove controversial. It is difficult to determine whether China\u2019s leaders actually have a penchant for far-sighted strategizing rooted in ancient wisdom and deep national feeling or are simply paying lip-service to history while muddling through and struggling to address dangerous contradictions within their regime. Westerners have certainly had a tendency to exaggerate Chinese time horizons. In the 1970s, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai was asked about the influence of the French Revolution of 1789. Zhou famously replied: \u201cToo early to say.\u201d Far from indicating he drew conclusions only after super-human, centuries-long analysis, though, Zhou thought he was being asked about the recent French student protests of 1968. Richard Nixon\u2019s translator, who heard Zhou answer, has said it was a misunderstanding \u201ctoo delicious\u201d to correct.[8] Western thought leaders continue to imagine China\u2019s perspective is immense. Consider Harvard political scientist Graham T. Allison, for example, who in his popular 2017 book argued Chinese leaders have a more \u201cexpansive sense of time\u201d than their Western counterparts.[9]\n\nWard never mistranslates or exaggerates. Whether Chinese leaders are actually relying on ancient wisdom or simply dressing up their biases as such, they certainly believe their contemporary political movement is also an ancient one in key ways. And, as Ward demonstrates throughout the book, China\u2019s leaders identify the unique characteristics of decades, and plot to exploit them in their plans and strategies. There is no better example of this than the Belt and Road Initiative, a massive international economic project intended to culminate in 2049, the hundredth anniversary of Communist victory on the Chinese mainland. Rather than a vague account of Chinese long-termism, Ward provides a detailed account of China\u2019s intentionally timed grand strategy, meant to return China to its rightful place in the world in time for its 2049 centenary.\n\nAgain, following Chinese official statements closely, Ward argues that the foundation of China\u2019s rejuvenation project is economic. China\u2019s immediate goal is to be prosperous. Ward emphasizes that Chinese initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative fundamentally attempt to protect and expand Chinese access to natural resources and markets. However, he also argues compellingly, based on the history of Chinese diplomacy, that major Chinese plans from the \u201cChinese Dream\u201d to the \u201cGreat Rejuvenation\u201d are also \u201cfundamentally military endeavors.\u201d[10] After all, China has repeatedly cited its so-called \u201cFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence\u201d to justify aggressive wars against its neighbors. China\u2019s economic rise has given it the resources to arm itself.[11] As the age-old Chinese aphorism states: \u201cA rich country, a strong military.\u201d[12]\n\nThis places the world at a new inflection point no less significant than when it initially engaged with China as the state \u201creformed and opened up\u201d beginning in 1978. Chinese leaders themselves consider 2000 to 2020 a key \u201cperiod of strategic opportunity.\u201d[13] The new question for the West, however, is not how to deal with China\u2019s exports and markets, but how to deal with China\u2019s fleets and armies. The economic rise of China is longstanding, although, as the ongoing U.S.-China trade war demonstrates, it remains contested in key ways. The ramifications of China\u2019s military rise, however, have yet to play out. Chinese leaders hope to have a military that is \u201csecond to none\u201d by the middle of this century.[14] Such military preeminence would fundamentally alter the global balance of power\u2014at the expense of the United States and its allies.\n\nU.S. and Chinese Flags (Council on Foreign Relations)\n\nWard does not shy away from proposing how America should respond to this challenge. He is unambiguous that if America does not maintain its economic supremacy, a network of alliances, and military power, China will destroy the world order as we know it. In contrast to commentators who focus on China\u2019s relative rise, Ward emphasizes that the U.S. must focus on sustaining and expanding American power. The key question, in his mind, is how much power will be ceded to China in the future. The American strategy of \u201cengage but hedge,\u201d Ward declares, \u201chas failed\u201d and brought the U.S. \u201cto the brink of the end of an American-led world.\u201d[15] In a compelling foreword, the former commander of the Pacific Fleet, retired Admiral Scott Swift, argues this book justifies a new American grand strategy to deal with China. Not all Americans will agree with this approach; \u201cengage but hedge\u201d still has many defenders in the foreign policy establishment. But China\u2019s Vision of Victory represents the most compelling case yet to replace it. After reading this book, its defenders cannot claim they were not warned about the risks they face.", "description": "China\u0092s Vision of Victory. Jonathan D.T. Ward.
