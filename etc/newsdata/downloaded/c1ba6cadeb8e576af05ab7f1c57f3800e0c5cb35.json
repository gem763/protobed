A life that includes taxpayers being forced to spend \u00a32.4million on doing up their 10-bedroom mansion.\n\nThe ITV documentary was called Harry and Meghan: An African Journey. But it turned into Megharry: A Life of Joint Misery.\n\nHaving sworn solidarity with the impoverished local women, the Duchess whined about the \u201cstruggle\u201d of being a royal which no one else \u201ccan understand\u201d due to her having a bit of bad press caused mainly by a row with her estranged father.\n\nHow can a titled woman, married to a man worth countless millions, who never has to work again to enjoy a life of utmost luxury, be so lacking in self-awareness that she tells the world as she stands before mud huts: \u201cIt is not enough to just survive something. That\u2019s not the point of life. You\u2019ve got to thrive.\u201d\n\nHow can you be so detached from what\u2019s going on around you, not just in Africa but back home in Britain, where young people are sleeping on the street and families exist on \u00adfoodbank handouts?\n\nThis couple claim to be modernising the monarchy but they\u2019re taking it back a generation. Because their demand to be allowed to dictate their state-subsidised role exclusively on their terms, while openly whinging about the downsides of their goldfish-bowl existence, means Megharry are Princess Margaret resurrected.\n\nThey see themselves as victims who shouldn\u2019t have to buy into the monarchy deal as they\u2019re not going to end up on the throne, thereby deserving more leeway.\n\nThey\u2019ve even decided, in true Margaret style, they now need a six-week break so they can wind down before their Christmas holiday.\n\nAs a taxpayer I\u2019m livid. But as a Republican I\u2019m doing cartwheels.", "description": "I was taken aback at the self-pitying outbursts from a privileged couple who, visiting Africa, stepped out of the Range Rovers they\u2019d had specially flown over, to do a TV broadcast bleating about the awful hand life has dealt them", "authors": ["Brian Reade"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20724193.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_harry_and_meghan_an_african_journey_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
