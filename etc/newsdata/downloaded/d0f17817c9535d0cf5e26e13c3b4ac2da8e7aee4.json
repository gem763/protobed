Why Belfast?\n\nI\u2019m from Belfast, and living back here for the first time since I left for university in 2008. Most recently I was living in Dublin for nearly two years, and then did an office job in Belfast from January up until August when I was made redundant, so I\u2019ve taken it as an opportunity to explore my passion and see if I can make it work for as long as I can realistically do so.\n\nI was originally planning to move back to Belfast around this time, and only moved up sooner because of a sudden job opportunity.\n\nI love Dublin, it\u2019s a great city, but it\u2019s crushingly expensive. I couldn\u2019t even have a pet because landlords typically say no.\n\nThe redundancy is unfortunate but ultimately I feel more settled here. My street is quiet enough not to be disturbed by noise in the evenings, but just off a main road and close to supermarkets and loved ones. I\u2019ll maybe leave in a few years for a bigger family home with my boyfriend, but for now It\u2019s the perfect spot for me.\n\nThe big question: The deposit. How much was it?\n\nI was saving while living in Dublin but it was so disheartening because I thought I\u2019d need a fortune of my own to combine with someone else\u2019s in future to secure a deposit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoving to Belfast lessened that pressure a lot due to more affordable housing. By the time I went to speak to a mortgage advisor they told me I could buy with only a 5% deposit and I cried on the spot.\n\nThe deposit for my home was only \u00a35,100. I had about \u00a32,000 saved from living in Dublin, and was fortunately able to live rent-free with my mum from January to June so I saved as much as I could. That gave me all I needed for the deposit. I did an ad for some drink last year that got renewed and so that gave me enough for an Ikea run and some tins of paint.\n\nPaying off her mortgage is \u00a3409 a month (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAnd how much does the house actually cost?\n\nThe sale completed for \u00a3102,000. It\u2019ll end up more expensive in the long run than if I had put down a 15% or 20% deposit, but for now I\u2019m just happy to have a place of my own.\n\nMy monthly mortgage is \u00a3409. This is relatively high, again due to the fact I only put down a small deposit, but it\u2019s manageable and much cheaper than the rent for my box room in Dublin.\n\nBills are probably an extra \u00a3100? For gas, electricity and insurance, then Netflix and internet\u2026 Let\u2019s say \u00a3120! I just pulled that number out of nowhere. How am I still alive?\n\nHow much did you earn while you were saving for the deposit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI moved back to Belfast in February for a great job paying \u00a326,000, I believe. That gave me enough to live on while saving as much as possible, which made the vast bulk of the deposit.\n\nHow was the process of getting a mortgage?\n\nHonestly it was a lot less daunting than I thought it would be. The paperwork was handled by the mortgage broker and they basically told me what needed done when and what other things I might need to consider. Finding the property I wanted was harder.\n\nVanessa has made the house her own with some truly glorious interior design \u2013 and plenty of paint (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHow did you find the house?\n\nI was searching PropertyPal.com daily, setting a price limit within my possible budget to see what was out there.\n\nI viewed a bunch of houses, some gorgeous bad boys that would end up getting bid WAY over my budget.\n\nThis one I loved because it was spacious, clean, and very close to city centre and my boyfriend\u2019s and mum\u2019s houses. I already knew the area well and mercifully was able to get the sale closed before a bidding war broke out.\n\nI moved in in June.\n\nHow have you made the house feel like home?\n\nLashing paint everywhere. All the walls were a nice bright white when I moved in, so I painted living area, the dining room, both bedrooms\u2026I haven\u2019t done anything to the kitchen or bathroom as I\u2019m very much out of money but after renting for 11 years I wanted to do everything I couldn\u2019t do before. Pictures everywhere. Dark walls. A pet!\n\nShe\u2019s a freelance photographer, so obviously all the artwork on the walls is brilliant (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHave you had to spend a lot more on things for the house?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot really, to be honest. So much of my stuff comes from Facebook Marketplace. I got my dining table and chairs for \u00a380. I could go crazy and take out a loan to fit a new kitchen more in my style and do up the bathroom and all but I\u2019m trying to employ some common sense in myself. If I can\u2019t afford it it\u2019s not getting done.\n\nAnd you have a dog! Did you have to make many adjustments to make the house work for your pet?\n\nHeidi the disgraceful labrador. I got her very soon after moving home. My mum loves dogs but isn\u2019t able to care for one due to her work hours and health conditions, so she was happy to have her about while I lived at home and brought her here with me after.\n\nHonestly the only real adjustment I\u2019ve had to make is installing a baby gate at the kitchen entry so she doesn\u2019t go berserk in the whole downstairs while I\u2019m out. I learned my lesson after a few of my plants met an untimely demise.\n\nAnyone who has jars of sweets in their home is a hero in our eyes (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nDo you feel like you have enough space?\n\nLoads of space. I have my spare room listed on Airbnb which has been a lifesaver after my redundancy, it\u2019s nice to have other people in the house as well you know? It\u2019s cosy.\n\nI might want to move to a bigger space in future if I have a family but I don\u2019t feel any particular desire for a house where I have to summon my children from the east wing for luncheon. Right now it\u2019s just me and Heidi and the occasional guest.\n\nDoes owning pose any problems you didn\u2019t have when you were renting?\n\nThe side of my bath was leaking before and I couldn\u2019t get my old neighbour landlord to come and fix it for me. Raging.\n\nBut other than that no not really. Owning a house comes with the fear that if anything goes wrong for me financially I could lose my home. Renting is the fear that everything could be going perfectly and then your landlord ups the rent by 30% for the craic, or tells you their niece is \u2018coming back from australia\u2019 and you\u2019re getting kicked out in 30 days.\n\nThere is fear as a homeowner but the rental situation is worse. I have no complaints, I\u2019m incredibly fortunate.\n\nWhat are your property plans for the future?\n\nIt probably won\u2019t be my forever home, but sure, who knows the future?\n\nMy boyfriend also owns his own place which has an additional bedroom and a big back garden which Heidi loves. I\u2019d say when we move in together it\u2019ll be into his place. See how I said when, not if. Hope you\u2019re reading this, Terry.\n\nHey, Terry. Thanks for reading. Shall the rest of us have a look around?\n\nWelcome in (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHere\u2019s the living room (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nArtwork and plants (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe\u2019re big fans of the seating options (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nMore sweets! Invite us round!

Hey, Heidi (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe kitchen (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nYes, she has those little dumpling steamers. Yes, we\u2019re impressed. (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThat\u2019s an oven glove, FYI (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nPoints for the matching kettle and toaster (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAnd the fancy knife set (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHere\u2019s Vanessa\u2019s bedroom (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAren\u2019t the colours great? (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAnd of course there\u2019s more excellent artwork (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nSome sleek storage space (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\n(Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThere\u2019s a spare bedroom, too, which Vanessa often rents out on Airbnb (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nSpot the colour scheme running through this house (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nFinally, the bathroom (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nComplete with more pops of pink (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe\u2019re impressed by anyone who has a toilet roll holder instead of just balancing it on the back of the loo (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nA wooden toothbrush box rather than your average mug (Picture: Justin Kernoghan/Photopress/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHow to get involved in What I Own What I Own is a Metro.co.uk series that takes you inside people's properties, to take an honest look at what it's like to buy a home in the UK.
