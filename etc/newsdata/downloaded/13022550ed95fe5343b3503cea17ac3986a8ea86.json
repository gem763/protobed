The new watch, called the Series 5, starts at $400 and will be launching on September 20.\n\nThat always-on display is important for the Apple Watch because it makes it much better at its most basic job: functioning as a wristwatch. Now that the Apple Watch has an always-on display, you can just glance down at your wrist to see the time and other information without having to move your wrist to turn on the screen.\n\nThat brings the Apple Watch up to speed with rivals like Fitbit, which just announced the Versa 2, another smartwatch with an always-on screen. Samsung's Galaxy Watch also has a screen that can stay on to show the time and other bits of information, even if you're not looking directly at it.\n\nI spent a few minutes trying out the new Apple Watch Series 5 after Apple's press event.
