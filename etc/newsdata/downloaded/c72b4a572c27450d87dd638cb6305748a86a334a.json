Well, even the experts disagree\n\nSo long as it\u2019s made from ripe tomatoes, I think sugo is fine without sugar, but my partner disagrees. What do you think?\n\nPeter, Zollikon, Switzerland\n\nSeptember is the month when British outdoor-grown tomatoes are at their peak, not to mention cheapest, so hit the market, fill your boots and channel your inner nonna by making vats of this classic pasta sauce.\n\nAs for Peter\u2019s domestic dispute, the simple answer is: it obviously all depends on the quality of the tomatoes, though, as with all cooking, your own tastes play a pivotal role, too, says Rachel Roddy, Feast\u2019s Italian correspondent. \u201cI don\u2019t know where this idea that adding sugar is wrong or even an issue came from,\u201d she says with a shake of the head. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019ve seen so many cooks add a pinch of sugar in much the same way as you\u2019d adjust the taste with salt.\u201d\n\nEssentially, the less ripe your tomatoes, the more likely they\u2019ll be to need a little something to help them along. Not only that, Roddy adds, but \u201cplenty of tomatoes are really quite acidic, so will only benefit from a bit of added sugar\u201d.\n\nEven the great and the good of the food world can\u2019t reach a consensus on the matter. Claudia Roden opts for \u201ca teaspoon of sugar, or to taste\u201d, for every kilo of fresh tomatoes (or 800g of tinned), whereas Anna del Conte adds the same amount to sugo made with tinned, but omits it \u201cin the summer when good fresh tomatoes are on the market\u201d; Alastair Little adds just \u201ca little sugar\u201d to his sugo by default, and Giorgio Locatelli only \u201cif needed\u201d. The queen of Italian food writing, Ada Boni, however, makes no mention of sugar at all, a path followed a quarter-century later by Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray in their 1990s River Cafe books.\n\nThat restaurant\u2019s current head chef, Joe Trivelli, is on-message, too. \u201cI absolutely don\u2019t do it,\u201d he says, though he accepts that may have something to do with being fortunate enough to work only with impeccable produce. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the tomatoes,\u201d he says. \u201cGood ones will be sweet enough as they are. Everyone used to put tomato puree in tomato sauce \u2013 well, my mum did, anyway \u2013 and that\u2019s also pretty pointless; all it does is add an artificial, sweet taste.\u201d\n\nMind you, Trivelli says, certain brands of tinned tomatoes come swimming in juice of questionable origin, so in some circumstances sugar is kind of forgivable. \u201cAfter all, when I was a student, we were taught always to add a touch of sugar, but I\u2019d forgotten about it until now \u2013 it hasn\u2019t crossed my mind to do so in years.\u201d\n\nThat said, officially the best sugo recipe in the whole world ever (don\u2019t all @ me at once, please: it\u2019s just a statement of fact), namely \u201ctomato sauce III\u201d in Marcella Hazan\u2019s 1976 Classic Italian Cookbook, includes a quarter-teaspoon of granulated sugar per kilo of ripe plum tomatoes. To make it, wash and halve the toms, then simmer in a covered pot for 10 minutes. Pass the now slightly slumped fruit through a food mill back into the pot, add 110g butter, a peeled and halved onion, a touch of salt and the sugar, and leave to burble and reduce gently, lid off, for 45 minutes. Pick out the onion, adjust the sauce for salt, then toss through cooked pasta or gnocchi. You\u2019ll never view pasta al pomodoro the same again, promise \u2013 as Hazan so modestly put it, this sauce is \u201cunsurpassed\u201d, and who am I to disagree?\n\n\u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?
