He made one, on just three attempts, during his one season at LSU.\n\nWe image the reaction will be even crazier whe n he hits an official three in a regular-season game against an actual NBA team.", "description": "He still awaits his first make in the regular season, but Ben Simmons actually hit a three in the 76ers' preseason game Tuesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/09/USAT/a73d7699-654d-4ab8-a942-8e6fdae40c5a-AP_76ers_Basketball.JPG?crop=4571,2571,x0,y114&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
