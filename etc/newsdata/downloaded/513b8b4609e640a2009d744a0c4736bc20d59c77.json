In 1881, the women organized a strike for higher wages \u2013 $1 for every dozen pounds of laundry \u2013 and greater autonomy over their industry.\n\nUS teacher strikes generated victories. So why are they ready to strike again? Read more\n\n\u201cMost would have said what they were attempting to do was impossible,\u201d Nelson said, her voice wavering.\n\n\u201cThere were no labor laws to protect them. There was no single employer with whom they could negotiate, and their low-skilled work could easily be taken over by others.\u201d\n\nYet the women persisted and, against the odds, prevailed. Militancy \u2013 and sometimes just the threat of it \u2013 can work even in the most dire circumstances, Nelson said. It\u2019s a principle she believes in deeply.\n\nFor many, Nelson represents the new face of labor. With manufacturing and mining on a long-term decline, unions have concentrated their battles on the service sector. Teachers\u2019 strikes and efforts to unionize fast food and hotel workers in the Fight for $15 movement \u2013 sectors dominated by women \u2013 have shown unions still have a role.\n\nEarlier this year, staring down the longest government shutdown in US history, Nelson gained national attention when she called for a general strike as a way of pressuring Donald Trump and Congress to act. The idea was radical \u2013 and supporters say it set in motion a series of events that brought the weeks-long shutdown to an end.\n\n\u201cPeople think power is a limited resource,\u201d she said in Atlanta. \u201cBut using power builds power.\u201d\n\nNelson has struck a chord with progressives and grassroots activists who have amplified calls for her to run for labor\u2019s top job: president of the nation\u2019s largest federation of unions, the 12.5 million-member AFL-CIO.\n\n\u201cShe knows how to excite people and how to give them the sense that a lot more is possible,\u201d said Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America, of which AFA is an affiliate.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sara Nelson speaks at a press conference in Arlington, Virginia, on 24 January.

But the longtime labor journalist Steven Greenhouse reported that Nelson and Liz Shuler, the AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer, are already vying for the role.\n\nNelson said she finds the prospect of leading the federation \u201cintriguing\u201d and \u201cexciting\u201d. But she stopped short of declaring her intention to run, concerned that a protracted leadership contest might distract from the challenges facing organized labor.\n\n\u201cI would love to be a part of that,\u201d she said. \u201cI can tell you that for sure. But I think it is too far off and we have too many battles.\u201d\n\nDecades of well-funded political opposition and a string of legal setbacks have decimated organized labor in America. The share of US workers covered by unions has fallen dramatically from more than 30% in the mid-20th century to 10.5% in 2018, a historic low. At the same time, wages for low-income workers have stagnated, while productivity increases, corporate profits soar and income inequality rises.\n\n\u201cThe reason that we have this level of inequality is not a mistake,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt is the result of very well-planned, aggressive steps taken by the right to destroy the labor movement and to take that check in our democracy away. And they almost succeeded.\u201d\n\nA 2018 supreme court decision that stripped public sector unions of their ability to collect \u201cfair-share fees\u201d from non-union members \u2013 Janus v AFSCME \u2013 was supposed to be the death knell of American labor. But it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThere are signs the ruling reinvigorated organizing campaigns, which has emboldened the labor movement and led to gains for some unions. A Gallup poll released this month found Americans support for unions at 64%, approaching a 50-year high.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the movement is drawing fresh energy from a wave of worker uprisings across the country. In the past 18 months, teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona, Marriott hotel workers, Stop & Shop supermarket employees and Uber and Lyft drivers have challenged their bosses with strikes and protest to demand higher wages and better working conditions.\n\nThere is a hunger for the people to rise up Randi Weingarten\n\n\u201cThere is a hunger for the people to rise up,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe all have that hunger. We do that through politics and we do that through collective action but at the same time the question has to be: what\u2019s the next step?\u201d\n\nFor Nelson, the next step is to build alliances. In May, she joined the United Mine Workers of America at a rally on Capitol Hill to urge Congress to pass legislation to protect coalminers\u2019 pensions.\n\nThe spectacle of flight attendants in their pressed uniforms and knotted neck scarves standing in solidarity with miners wearing camouflage print union shirts was \u201cfairly unusual\u201d, conceded Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers. But this is what Nelson says she means when she talks about worker \u201csolidarity\u201d.\n\nAs the head of the AFA, she has worked to forge relationships with labor groups in other industries. Nelson argues that if workers join forces over wages and working conditions, they are less likely to be swayed by Trump\u2019s efforts to divide them by race, culture and identity.\n\n\u201cNo one is born with sexism, racism, ageism in their heart,\u201d Nelson said in her Atlanta speech. \u201cThese are the tactics of the boss, of those who want all the money and all the power to deny us solidarity, the greatest force for good. Expose it. Call it out. Deal with it. And in our unions and on our picket lines we can do exactly that.\u201d\n\nAs the head of a union that represents 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, Nelson has been a part of some of the biggest cultural movements and political fights. In the wake of #MeToo, she testified to Congress that roughly three in four flight attendants experienced sexual harassment during their flying career. Leaders of an industry that once imposed age and weight restrictions on flight attendants must do more to combat sexual harassment in the workplace, she told lawmakers.\n\nEarlier this year, her union sprang to action with a petition and media campaign to release a flight attendant who was detained for weeks by immigration officials in Texas after working a flight to Mexico because of her status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. And Nelson has also been a vocal critic of Boeing in the wake of two 737 Max jet crashes, that killed hundreds of people and led to the plane\u2019s grounding. In June, she told a congressional panel that her union had noticed a \u201cchastened tone\u201d from the company.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sara Nelson talks to family members of victims of 737 Max crashes before a House subcommittee hearing in Washington DC, on 17 July.

But today\u2019s labor leaders, facing entrenched opposition to organizing and collective bargaining, have been forced to find creative ways to build power in a hostile legal environment.\n\n\u201cNelson knows her history. She knows that unions and working people build power without having the law on their side and without accommodating or bowing to the interest of companies,\u201d said Rebecca Givan, a professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University. \u201cBut clearly she believes there is value in reviving some of those strategies.\u201d\n\nThe labor movement is not something that we have to rebuild. The structure already exists Sara Nelson\n\n\u201cThe labor movement is not something that we have to rebuild,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThe structure already exists,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that has to be put into fourth gear and supercharged.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 presidential race will be a test of labor\u2019s political clout as the Democratic candidates fiercely compete for their support. There is a diversity of political views among the union ranks, as demonstrated by a debate over how best to expand health coverage.\n\nNelson is a vocal supporter of a Medicare for All single-payer healthcare system. She argues that contract negotiations are increasingly consumed by fights over coverage and benefits, and believes that if the issue were moved \u201coff the table\u201d unions could spend more time fighting for wage increases and better working conditions.\n\nBut some leaders have raised concerns that a single-payer system, championed by the progressive presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, could negatively affect the benefits they have already painstakingly negotiated. One of the loudest opponents of Medicare for All has been the International Association of Fire Fighters, which endorsed former vice-president Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.\n\nHarold Schaitberger, the union\u2019s president, says his union\u2019s healthcare plan is designed to meet the unique and specific healthcare needs of firefighters that a Medicare plan is unlikely to provide.\n\nSanders recently introduced a pro-labor plan that sought to assuage those worries. The proposal would effectively require employers to return any healthcare savings to workers in the form of wage increases or benefits.\n\nStill, Schaitberger worries that candidates like Sanders risk moving the Democratic party \u201ctoo far to the left\u201d and leaving workers like his members behind.\n\n\u201cI see us succeeding in many ways,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know that the success of labor can be attributed to the associated energy on what I describe as the ultra-progressive, ultra-liberal far left.\u201d\n\nNelson has not publicly backed a 2020 candidate and her union is still designing its endorsement process. But she speaks highly of progressive stalwarts Sanders and Warren, both of whom have introduced expansive plans for growing unions and expanding worker protections.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s exciting is that this year we actually have some real choices for labor,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Atlanta, Nelson urged the audience not to wait until then to get involved.\n\n\u201cChange comes fast when the risk becomes too great for those in power,\u201d she said.", "description": "Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants, has struck a chord with activists calling for her to run for labor\u2019s top job: president of the AFL-CIO", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84fd9e0aa761fa9dec1b32556dc57b89aa3005c9/0_66_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ca3fed78daec60d68a704e59eb894040", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
