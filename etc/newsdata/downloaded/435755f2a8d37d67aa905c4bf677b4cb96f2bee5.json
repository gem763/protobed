It\u2019s annual inflow average is 1,387GL.\n\nThe lakes sit within the town of Menindee which experienced mass fish deaths along the Darling River last summer.\n\nResidents have questioned the drainage of the lakes twice in 2017 with some suggesting the fish carnage wouldn\u2019t have happened if the lakes were full.\n\nThe WaterNSW data shows the lakes received 2100GL of water in 2016/17 followed by just 52GL of water in 2017/18.\n\nUnder the worst-case scenario, the Lachlan River, which runs through the state\u2019s central west, is projected to run dry by March 2020, leaving the towns of Forbes, Cowra and Parkes without water supply.\n\nThe river is the fourth-longest in Australia and annually receives an average of 1,212GL of water but in the last year recorded inflows of just 107GL.\n\nThe state\u2019s north-west including the small towns of Manilla and Boggabri could also run out of water by the same date if the upper Namoi River doesn\u2019t receive any rainfall.\n\nAustralia launches emergency relocation of fish as largest river system faces collapse Read more\n\nA group of rivers which straddle the NSW and Queensland border and supply water to the towns of Boggabilla, Ashford and Goondiwindi, received just 17GL of inflows in the past year compared with an annual average of 1000GL.\n\nWaterNSW predicts the Border rivers will run dry by September 2020 without government intervention and rain.\n\nWater is projected to stop flowing from taps in the northern NSW town of Inverell in March 2021 where the Gwydir River, which usually receives 1,141GL of rain a year, will dry up after just 19GL entered the system last year.\n\nThe data predicts that most of Sydney\u2019s water supply will remain flowing until at least October 2021 when, under the worst-case scenario, the upper Nepean River will run dry.\n\nAustralia\u2019s largest urban water supply dam \u2013 Warragamba Dam \u2013 is projected to stop flowing by January 2022, according to the data.\n\nWarragamba Dam received 105GL of water in the last year compared with its annual average of 1,069GL.\n\nPavey said that Dubbo\u2019s Burrendong dam only has 4.5% water left in it, although it could provide a further 21GL below that empty level.\n\n\u201cBut we need to find some more water in the bores around Dubbo \u2013 and we\u2019re confident of doing that \u2013 it\u2019s a very marshy area, there\u2019s a lot of underground supplies there \u2026 but it is a challenge,\u201d she said.\n\nPavey defended the NSW government\u2019s handling of the crisis, saying \u201cin 2016 the state was awash with water\u201d and then three years later it suffered historic low inflows.\n\nPavey sidestepped questions about whether global warming constituted a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d but accepted the drought \u201ccould be [caused by] climate change, climate variability\u201d.\n\nPavey and Steph Ryan, Victoria\u2019s shadow water minister, were in Canberra for the Nationals\u2019 federal council, which concluded on Saturday.\n\nRyan called for \u201curgent action\u201d from the federal government, noting the council had passed two motions opposing the recovery of 450GL of upwater from southern basin irrigators. She also called for 300GL of water from the commonwealth environmental water-holder to be traded back on to the market.", "description": "WaterNSW warns without significant rain, Macquarie River will run dry, wiping out supply to Dubbo, Cobar, Nyngan and Narromine", "authors": ["Paul Karp"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54da4cd92e10ee652916645d2d827e61a6c9c640/0_291_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8aed73de74bcd590f582ac93b0ff9fe3", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
