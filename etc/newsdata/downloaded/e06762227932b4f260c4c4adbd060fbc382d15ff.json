Even so, the development of a system to classify such funds in order to analyze them speaks to their growing appeal.\n\nThe report comes from Global X, a thematic ETF provider \u2013 MarketWatch profiled its \u201cConscious Capitalism\u201d fund KRMA, -0.55% in August \u2013 in order to classify the \u201cdisruptive themes and the thematic ETFs that track them,\u201d and follow industry trends in this area.\n\nRelated: Do well by doing good with this fund that supports freedom and human rights\n\nOne of the most useful sections of the Global X report might be its attempt to define \u201cthematic investing,\u201d before even quantifying it. The company defines thematic investing as a \u201clong term, growth-oriented strategy, that is typically unconstrained geographically or by traditional sector/industry classifications, has low correlation to other growth strategies, and invests in relatable concepts.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\n\u201cThere must be high conviction that the theme will materialize and have a meaningful impact on segments of the economy or markets,\u201d Global X explains.\n\nIn addition, there must be a way for investors to access that theme, which means there have to be publicly-traded companies with that theme whose stock can be bundled into a fund. Ideally, that's a broad group of companies, all of which have high liquidity and attribute a substantial portion of their business operations, including revenues, assets, research and development to the theme.\n\nThat may sound obvious, but some themes may struggle to find a broad enough basket of securities that meet its criteria. In the case of Nuveen\u2019s ESG High Yield Corporate Bond ETF NUHY, -0.24% that constraint makes the fund a riskier bet because it\u2019s less diversified. And for the Procure Space ETF UFO, +0.40% , a \u201cspace economy\u201d fund, it simply means the fund has a lot of generalist stocks that help support outer space exploration from a very terrestrial perspective: ground equipment manufacturing, satellite-based telecommunications, and so on.\n\nFinally, \u201ca theme must be expected to express itself over a medium to long-term time horizon,\u201d Global X says, meaning five years or more. That allows enough time for the theme, not lucky market timing, to be proven out.\n\nRead: Want to profit from the housing shortage? There\u2019s a new ETF for that.\n\nGlobal X points out that thematic ETFs hold only $25.1 billion, out of $4 trillion in the overall ETF space. And they represent only 119 funds out of about 2,300.\n\nThe company\u2019s classification system includes three categories: Disruptive Technology, People & Demographics, and Physical Environment, which contain 10 \u201cmega-themes\u201d including Big Data, Digital Content, FinTech, Connectivity, Robotics, New Consumer, Health, Climate Change, Infrastructure Development, and Mobility. Within the mega-themes sit about three dozen smaller themes ranging from Millennials to Blockchain to 3D Printing.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, five thematic ETFs launched, Global X noted. Four of them invest in cannabis, and one is focused on cloud computing. Meanwhile, funds in Global X\u2019s Climate Change category had the biggest growth in assets during the quarter.\n\nSee: Here\u2019s the right way to trade ETFs", "description": "Innovative exchange-traded funds with clever marketing and cute tickers grab lots of media attention, but command a relatively small share of the number of...", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN870_Cannab_ZG_20190722135548.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
