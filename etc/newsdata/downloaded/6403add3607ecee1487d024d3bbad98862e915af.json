Scott claimed that nobody had ever been spiked at the club, and insinuated that Shantel must be trying to \u201cget\u201d something out of the claim.\n\nObviously, this infuriated thousands of people across Australia, including a Perth lawyer, who is now trying to have the venue\u2019s licensing revoked.\n\nSince the ordeal, Catriona Macleod of Cullen Macleod law firm has called for Scott\u2019s liquor license to be revoked. Macleod is the director of Cullen Macleod, one of Perths leading law firms when it comes to liquor licensing and alcohol-related legalities, according to Daily Mail.\n\nCatriona believes that Neil Scott\u2019s behaviour demonstrates that he\u2019s unfit to hold a liquor license, and is working to get it revoked.\n\n\u201cThe licensing authority needs to investigate if he\u2019s a fit and proper person to hold that licence and if what\u2019s been reported is true. In my opinion he\u2019s not fit and proper,\u201d she said.\n\nSince the ordeal, Catriona has sent a formal complaint to the Liquor Licensing and Liquor Enforcement Unit Director, hoping to get Neil\u2019s license revoked or at least investigated.\n\n\u201cI think his behaviour is pretty reprehensible in how he\u2019s responded,\u201d Macleod told Daily Mail.\n\nCatriona\u2019s complaint has been received by the Liquor Licensing and Liquor Enforcement Authority, and is currently being investigated.\n\n\u201cI was pretty aghast. The whole purpose of our liquor act are to minimise the harm that\u2019s associated with alcohol. He failed to take it seriously, he failed to look into it,\u201d she said \u201cIt was such a terrible response repeatedly. You can\u2019t say these things to people.\u201d\n\nThe authority is yet to announce whether or not they\u2019ll take action against Neil Scott. However, as a knowledgeable legal professional who specialises in liquor licensing, it is doubtful that Catriona Macleod would file a complaint without a valid reason.\n\nREAD MORE Punters Reportedly Abandon Rapture Nightclub After Owner's Heinous Drink Spiking Remarks", "description": "Perth lawyer Catriona Macleod has written a formal complaint against Rapture Nightclub's Neil Scott to the state's liquor licensing authorities.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-21-at-10.18.13-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
