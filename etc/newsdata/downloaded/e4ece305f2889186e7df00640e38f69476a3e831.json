Murrietta-Golding was an estimated 35 feet away from the officers when one of them fired a single bullet into his head. The officer then hopped the fence, approached the boy\u2019s limp body and handcuffed his hands behind his back.\n\nThe video comes after the police department in Fresno, a city in California\u2019s Central Valley, refused to release the footage while publicly stating that the killing was \u201cjustified\u201d, said Stuart Chandler, an attorney for Murrietta-Golding\u2019s father.\n\n\u201cThe city was so adamant that the officer \u2018feared for his life\u2019,\u201d the lawyer told the Guardian on Thursday. \u201cWhy were they hiding the video? If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the video speaks a million words.\u201d\n\nThe aftermath of the shooting caught on video was especially upsetting to watch, the attorney added.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s unconscious and in the process of dying. What is the threat?\u201d said Chandler. \u201cThey just saw him as an animal who had been shot. They hunted a target. It\u2019s inhumane.\u201d\n\nA paramedic report showed that police declined to remove the handcuffs when an EMT arrived, with an officer saying police would only take them off later at the hospital.\n\nJerry Dyer, the Fresno police chief at the time of the shooting, has previously stated that the officer, Sgt Ray Villalvazo, thought \u201che was about to be shot\u201d. Dyer claimed the teen \u201creached into his waistband several times\u201d, according to the Fresno Bee. But the new footage, which Chandler obtained in the process of a civil lawsuit against the department, only shows him running away as he appears to be holding up his pants. He was unarmed.\n\nFresno\u2019s current police chief, Andrew Hall, continued to defend the shooting as a justified use of deadly force in a statement this week, saying Murrietta-Golding was \u201cknown to carry firearms\u201d and noting that he had entered a daycare center when he hopped the fence.\n\nFootage of California police killing unarmed teen prompts claim of 'trigger-happy' officers Read more\n\nHall further alleged that Murrietta-Golding was involved in a crime the previous day.\n\nA spokesperson for the Fresno police department did not respond to an inquiry seeking clarification on the firearms allegation and the use of handcuffs.\n\nAccording to the family\u2019s suit, police were trying to question Murrietta-Golding, but lacked a search or arrest warrant, so officers staked out his house then pulled him over in a car with two other teens and \u201cheld them at gunpoint\u201d. At that point, he fled.\n\nLawyers for the family noted that the shooting happened on a Saturday while the daycare center was empty. And Chandler said it was \u201cdespicable\u201d that police were still trying to attack Murrietta-Golding\u2019s character, saying the allegations and insinuations about what had happened prior were not relevant to the officer\u2019s decision to kill the boy as he fled.\n\nThe shooting happened nine months after Fresno police killed Dylan Noble, shooting the unarmed 19-year-old multiple times, including while he was lying on the ground, barely moving. Advocates have long argued that Fresno police need to focus on de-escalation and anti-bias training, and a 2017 American Civil Liberties Union report found that police shoot people of color at a hugely disproportionate rate in the city.\n\nChandler faulted Fresno police for failing to implement meaningful reforms after both killings of unarmed teens.\n\n\u201cThere has been no change in either the culture, the training or the mentality regarding the use of deadly force.\u201d\n\nThe state of California recently passed a major reform meant to limit the use of lethal force by police, with a law considered the strictest in the country.", "description": "Footage of Fresno, California, incident follows police claims that killing of unarmed Isiah Murrietta-Golding, 16, was justified", "authors": ["Sam Levin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb310064fc6f7be3ecb9125275303840a961ed2c/0_60_715_429/master/715.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=45d5b210ff075ce7ebfa640cff5e19c8", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
