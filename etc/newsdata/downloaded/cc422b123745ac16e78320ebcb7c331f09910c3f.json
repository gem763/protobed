Extreme heatwaves will become more commonplace, causing water and food shortages. The planet's biodiversity will suffer. And so will we.\n\nIn support of the Global Climate Strike - a week of action to demand climate justice, from September 20 to 27 - Pedestrian Group is doubling down on content that educates and empowers you to do your bit for our planet. Click here to learn more about the global movement fighting for our future.\n\nBut don't just take our word for it: those are the findings of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose 2018 Special Report urged governments around the world to take urgent action to avoid an environmental disaster of unprecedented proportions.\n\nOur leaders, simply put, aren't listening. They're willfully ignoring the facts in front of them, and routinely caving into their own pig-headed interests. Making them pay attention to us, to the will of the people, to the will of the planet, is not going to be easy. That's why we've got to be loud.\n\nThis Friday, September 20, Pedestrian Group \u2060\u2014 home to PEDESTRIAN.TV, Business Insider, Kotaku, Gizmodo, POPSUGAR and Lifehacker \u2060\u2014 will participate in the Global Climate Strike, taking a long (long) lunch to join the worldwide call for climate justice in planned strikes around the country.\n\nWe won't stop there. From September 20 \u2013 27, our six sites will bring you content we hope will educate and empower you to do your bit for our planet \u2014 from how to ask your boss for the day off to attend the climate change strike in your city to tips for reducing your food wastage.\n\nEarth is our home. And now, right now, it's on fire.\n\nTime for us to act.", "description": "The planet is in the grips of a dire climate crisis.
