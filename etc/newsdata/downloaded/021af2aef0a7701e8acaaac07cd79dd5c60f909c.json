As such he would seem to have attracted votes from those on the left and elsewhere who feel unease about his running mate's populism, while at the same time benefiting from her appeal.\n\nAs Mr Fern\u00e1ndez told the Pagina 12 website (in Spanish) in February: \"With Cristina it's not enough but without her it's not possible.\"\n\nIn other words his closeness to the Kirchners, but also his distance from them, both seem to have helped him to win votes.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mr Fern\u00e1ndez (R) sparred with Mr Macri (L) in two presidential debates\n\nThe president-elect is also seen as a unifying force, bringing together pro- and anti-Peronist forces in Frente de Todos, a broad front focused on removing President Macri from office.\n\nHe faces an country demoralised by deep recession, high inflation and biting austerity, with whom his pragmatic, interventionist economic policies are clearly resonating.", "description": "Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina's president-elect, has caused quite a stir despite his obscurity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0251/production/_109339500_057369030-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
