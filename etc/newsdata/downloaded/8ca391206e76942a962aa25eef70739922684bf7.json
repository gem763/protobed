According to a study led by the Bank for International Settlements, there are over 40 countries that are currently looking to develop a digital currency.\n\nThe transformation of how money is being perceived is changing how the financial system works. Recently, the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, commented on the subject of fiat digital currencies saying that as long as central banks don\u2019t offer a digital currency option for their users, those will continue on seeking to use cryptocurrencies as a means of payment or unit of account; recurring to privately owned entities instead of those governed by the state.\n\nAdditionally, the letter states the risks of relying on the private sector to develop digital currencies, which includes losing control of monetary policies and the ability to implement effective anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures.\n\nWith other companies like Libra, J.P. Morgan, and Wells Fargo currently developing and testing digital currencies, congressmen ask the Federal Reserve to answer some questions in regards to the possible development of a U.S. dollar digital currency in an attempt to ensure that the United States dollar remains financially competitive worldwide.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cryptocoin.News Is The Central News Source For Information On Cryptocurrencies.
