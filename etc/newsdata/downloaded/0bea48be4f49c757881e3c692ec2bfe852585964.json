One Washington, D.C.-based talk-radio host speculates that Mrs. Clinton \u2014 who turns 72 on Saturday \u2014 wakes up every morning at her estate in Chappaqua, N.Y., facedown on the floor next to a box of cheap New Zealand chardonnay after crying herself to sleep the night before. The bitterness of that \u201cwhat might have been\u201d \u2014 her shattered dream of shattering the glass ceiling at the White House \u2014 apparently plays out on an endless-loop tape in her head, where Mr. Trump (and now also a Hawaii congresswoman) reside rent-free.\n\nThe two-year probe (aka \u201cwitch hunt\u201d) by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III of Mr. Trump\u2019s alleged campaign collusion with the Russians \u2014 which was supposed to vindicate the former first lady, even if it wouldn\u2019t put her back in the White House \u2014 was a colossal bust. It might be over, but not for Mrs. Clinton, who has now concocted a bizarre Russia Collusion 2.0 narrative for the 2020 election. In Mrs. Clinton\u2019s cockamamie conspiracy theory, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 is a Russian agent.\n\nIn an interview last week on the \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast hosted by David Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton suggested that the Russians are \u201cgrooming [Gabbard] to be the third-party candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cThey have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far \u2014 and that\u2019s assuming [2016 Green Party candidate] Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she\u2019s also a Russian asset.\u201d\n\nThe implication was that any such third-party candidacy would only ensure that Mr. Trump would win re-election a little more than a year from now. Mrs. Gabbard has denied any intention to mount an independent presidential bid. (Just as an aside, it\u2019s worth noting that most news media reports of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cManchurian candidate\u201d allegations weren\u2019t prefaced with the same adjectives \u2014 such as \u201cunfounded,\u201d \u201cbaseless\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d \u2014 now routinely applied, with editorializing abandon, to practically every claim Mr. Trump makes. Double-standards, anyone?)\n\nIt\u2019s an odd accusation to level at Mrs. Gabbard, who is a major in the U.S. (not Russian) Army National Guard and served in Iraq. But she also has been highly critical of the U.S. role as \u201cthe world\u2019s policeman\u201d (a position she shares with Mr. Trump) and of what she called a U.S.-led \u201cregime-change war\u201d against Syrian strongman Bashar Assad. The Hawaii Democrat fired back with both barrels, calling her party\u2019s twice-failed presidential candidate a warmonger and the \u201cembodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d Mrs. Gabbard said she had long wondered who was behind the \u201cconcerted campaign to destroy my reputation,\u201d adding: \u201cNow we know.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cRussian agent\u201d charge is as curious as it is scurrilous, inasmuch as Mrs. Gabbard is hardly a Trump acolyte. The Hawaii Democrat is a lefty who backed the campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the openly socialist Vermont independent, for the 2016 party nomination. But anyone who read the 2014 book \u201cHRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton\u201d can probably surmise that the real reason Mrs. Clinton would, out of the blue, turn on a fellow Democrat is simply because Mrs. Gabbard didn\u2019t support America\u2019s entitled Eva Peron for the party\u2019s 2016 nod. The book, by Jonathan Allen of NBC News and Amie Parnes of The Hill, revealed that the Clintons (both Bill and Hillary) have long memories \u2014 and longer knives \u2014 for anyone who crossed them over more than two decades, tracking it all on a detailed Microsoft Excel spreadsheet of \u201csaints and sinners,\u201d whom they would reward or punish accordingly.\n\nThat also likely explains why Mrs. Gabbard\u2019s rivals for the party\u2019s nomination who came to her defense didn\u2019t criticize Mrs. Clinton \u2014 who The New York Times reported Oct. 22 has looked at making a third run \u2014 for making the baseless accusation. Rep. Justin Amash, Michigan Republican-turned-independent and a certified Never-Trumper, was not similarly constrained. \u201cThe thing we know for sure is that Hillary Clinton is a Donald Trump asset. Hillary does \u2014 and did \u2014 drive many people into the arms of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Amash tweeted. \u201cHer attack on Tulsi does likewise.\u201d If there really is \u201cno such thing as bad publicity,\u201d Mrs. Gabbard\u2019s flagging campaign might ironically benefit, at least in the short term, from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s outlandish allegation.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
