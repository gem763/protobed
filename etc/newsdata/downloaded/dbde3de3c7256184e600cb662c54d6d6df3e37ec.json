But they\u2019re not crumbling yet.\n\nWhile most are leaving politics and feeling less pressure to defend Trump, the retirees sound much like their GOP colleagues who are staying in Congress. They\u2019ve downplayed the case against Trump, criticized the impeachment investigation, been vague or said nothing.\n\n\u201cImpeachment would be a mistake,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican bellwether on the issue, said in a statement Wednesday. He said while it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for Trump to have prodded foreign governments to investigate his political opponents, next year\u2019s election is \u201cthe right way to decide who should be president.\u201d\n\nAlexander, 79, is retiring after four decades in politics. He\u2019s respected by both parties as an independent voice who\u2019s already taken on Trump, including opposing his efforts to unilaterally spend money on building a Mexican border wall.\n\nCongressional investigators are still studying Trump\u2019s effort to pressure Ukrainian leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential contender. With uncertainty over what new evidence may emerge, it\u2019s too early for many Republicans to announce a firm stance.\n\nBut a look at the retirees themselves and at President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment two decades ago provides reason to doubt that they\u2019ll abandon Trump in droves.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s four senators and 17 House members who have announced they are not seeking reelection next year are largely loyalists with little history of bucking party leaders. Political consultants and academics consider past voting records and ideology key indicators of whether lame-duck lawmakers will abandon their party.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sort of off the leash there, they can bark as much as they want\u201d with their rhetoric, said Michael Romano, a political science professor at Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah University who\u2019s studied lame-duck lawmakers. \u201cWhether or not that translates into an actual vote is kind of mitigated by ideology, a lot.\u201d\n\nDuring Clinton\u2019s impeachment, just two Democrats and six Republicans who were retiring, and none from the Senate, crossed party lines. The overwhelming number of defectors ran for reelection and won.\n\nIn today\u2019s hyperpartisan climate, if the House impeaches Trump, it seems hard to envision 20 Republicans in the Senate joining all Democrats for the two-thirds majority required to remove Trump from office. Some retiring Republicans might be reluctant to cast a futile vote against Trump after a lifetime of party loyalty. Others might view it as a way to burnish their reputations.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to decide where the evidence lies and where you want your legacy to be,\u201d said Republican pollster Jon McHenry.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., has commented little on impeachment and is considered worth watching. He\u2019s said he won\u2019t seek reelection in 2022, and his panel is conducting its own investigation of the whistleblower complaint against Trump.\n\nThe most closely observed House retiree is probably moderate Texas Rep. Will Hurd, 42. A former undercover CIA officer, he\u2019s opposed hard-line Trump immigration policies and was considered a rising Republican star before retiring. He\u2019s expressed doubt that Trump\u2019s actions are impeachable but said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that he supports hearings \u201cto get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\nDeparting Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., told St. Louis radio station KMOX on Thursday that because Trump pulled U.S. troops from Syria, prompting a Turkish attack on U.S. Kurdish allies, he decided to pull his name \u201coff the \u2018I support Donald Trump\u2019 list.\u201d\n\nShimkus later said he was withdrawing as an official Trump campaign supporter, leaving unaddressed how that might reflect his view on impeachment.\n\nAmong other Republicans leaving Congress, Michigan Rep. Paul Mitchell called the impeachment push a \u201ccircus\u201d in an interview but said he would \u201cprotect and defend the Constitution.\u201d Wisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, 76, said Congress is \u201cwasting its time\u201d because there\u2019s insufficient public support for removing Trump.\n\nSenate Majority Leader McConnell has already signaled he will protect Trump. The Kentucky Republican, who\u2019s seeking reelection next year, says in an online campaign ad that stopping impeachment requires \u201ca Senate majority, with me as the majority leader.\u201d\n\nWhen the GOP-run House voted to authorize its Clinton impeachment inquiry in October 1998, just two of the 31 Democrats who joined all Republicans in voting \u201cyes\u201d were retiring.\n\nJust one of those retirees joined four other Democrats and voted that December to impeach Clinton. He was Pennsylvania Rep. Paul McHale, who backed three of the four articles of impeachment. The House approved two of them.\n\nMcHale, a former Marine and 48 at the time, said in a recent interview that though he was retiring, he contemplated seeking office again and wasn\u2019t free of political pressure. He said he voted for impeachment because Clinton had lied about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\n\u201cI lost a lot of friends because of that vote,\u201d said McHale, who never returned to elective office.\n\nSix lame-duck House Republicans each opposed one article of impeachment against Clinton. On the four articles, overall House GOP defections ranged from five to 81.\n\nDuring the February 1999 Senate impeachment trial, \u201cI tried to hold them in line,\u201d former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of GOP senators in a recent interview.\n\nEven so, 10 Republicans voted against one or both impeachment articles. None were lame ducks.\n\nNo Democrats crossed party lines. Both articles were rejected.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Retiring congressional Republicans are a natural group to watch for defectors as Democrats' impeachment inquiry of President Donald", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/10/b4cb9d_trump-impeachment-retiring-republicans-37297-in-jan-29-2019-file-photo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
