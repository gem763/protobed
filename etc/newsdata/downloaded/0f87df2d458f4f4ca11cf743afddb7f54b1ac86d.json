After his third try, McAleenan gave up, claiming he was going to go 'back to work and keep trying to secure this country'\n\nAndrew Selee, a co-organizer of the event, pleaded for the protesters to stop. 'Colleagues, you're invoking democracy, democracy requires dialogue, it requires listening, it requires a two-way street'\n\n'We hear you,' she repeated several times as the protesters continued to chant. 'This audience is here to engage in a dialogue and listen to the speaker, please.' Protesters then began listing names.\n\n'Until we hear, we are not in a conversation. So let's stop the one way street, let's listen to the speaker, then let's have an exchange. Thank you very much. Let's try again,' she signaled to McAleenan.\n\nAt several points the audience began to clap at the announcer, indicating they wanted to hear the Homeland Security official speak, but at no point did those protesting sit down or indicate they would stop.\n\nWhen McAleenan began thanking the different institutions for hosting him at Georgetown Law, the protests started up again.\n\n'Could you please have some respect for this audience who came here to listen to this speaker?' the announcer shouted into the microphone, now about five minutes from the time McAleenan was initially introduced.\n\nThe rest of the audience appeared visibly annoyed, with some checking their watches and others becoming restless in their seats.\n\n'We'll give it one more shot,' McAleenan started his remarks for the second time. 'As a career law enforcement professional, I've dedicated my career to protecting the right to free speech and all the values we hold dear in America from all threats.'\n\n'Bulls\u2022\u2022t!' one protester shouted, garnering a snicker from the audience, which McAleenan ignored.\n\n'So, we'll go ahead and try one more time, but otherwise I'm going to go back to work and keep trying to secure this country.'\n\n'When immigrants are under attack, what do we do?' one protesters prompted. 'Stand up fight back!' the group responded in chant, which varied slightly over the seven-minutes of one-and-off shouting\n\nSelee, who is the president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, said he was 'saddened' that protesters didn't want to hear from a diverse perspective and engage with him instead of shut him down\n\nMcAleenan thanked his hosts before leaving and said they could post the written version of his remarks on their website\n\nThe protesters persisted and McAleenan shut his binder, stepped away from the podium, and could be heard telling the forum's organizers that he could post his remarks on Georgetown Law's website if he felt so inclined.\n\nAndrew Selee, the president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, which was hosting the event, said he wanted to take a shot at calming down the protesters.\n\n'Colleagues, you're invoking democracy, democracy requires dialogue, it requires listening, it requires a two-way street,' Selee said.\n\n'Ok, last time team,' McAleenan said in his last ditch effort.\n\n'Lot to cover today. There's some very serious issues that we can talk about in candor and a real dialogue, or we can continue to shout,' he said.\n\n'I'd like to take our dialogue this morning above the politics and the daily news cycle and talk about the challenges and efforts that we've faced over the past year,' McAleenan continued, 'but also given that this is an audience primarily of immigration lawyers, advocates and law students, to also talk about some of the fundamental issues we face with the current legal framework and its ability to address large-scale immigration flows.'\n\nAnd then the protesters shouted again.\n\nThe DHS head shrugged, defeated and shut his binder, yet again. 'Thank you,' he said to his hosts as he left the room.\n\nThe interruption lasted for more than seven minutes, and is the latest example of a Trump administration official being blocked from speaking in public or confronted by protesters.\n\nMcAleenan's scheduled remarks were intended for an audience of lawyers, immigration policy analysts and students at an annual conference organized by the Migration Policy Institute in Washington.\n\n'Deeply saddened that protesters decided to interrupt @DHSMcAleenan during his speech at a conf organized by @MigrationPolicy @cliniclegal @GeorgetownLaw,' Selee tweeted. 'We need to hear from diverse perspectives in a democratic society, and the audience lost the chance to engage w/him on policy.'\n\nIllegal immigration is a very divisive topic in the U.S., especially following the Trump administration's zero tolerance immigration policies. McAleenan says he wants to bring more civility to the topic and claims he has tried to use more neutral language\n\nImmigration policy is a hot button issue in the U.S., especially following the Trump administration enacting zero tolerance immigration rules and has privately expressed interest in shutting down the southern border.\n\nMcAleenan seems to want to bring more civility to the topic, explaining last week that he has concerns over the partisanship surrounding immigration enforcement \u2013 likely referencing an 'abolish ICE' movement, among other issues. He said he is trying to turn down the temperature in the immigration debate and is attempting to use more neutral language.\n\nThe acting director, who assumed the post in April 2019 after Kirstjen Nielsen was ousted, described family separations as a mistake.\n\nThe immigration conference organizers credited the protesters to a group called CREDO Action, the advocacy arm of CREDO, a progressive grassroots organization. It is the same group that has in the past demonstrated outside McAleenan's home.\n\nA representative told The Hill that the goal of the protest 'was to prevent McAleenan from having a platform to normalizing Trump's cruel immigration policies and spreading hatred.'\n\nWhile still serving as DHS secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen was confronted outside her residence and while dining at a Mexican restaurant in Washington last year.", "description": "The acting director of Homeland Security was unable to present his prepared remarks Monday at Georgetown University after protesters persisted for about seven minutes and forced him offstage.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/20/19409616-0-image-a-45_1570475074725.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
