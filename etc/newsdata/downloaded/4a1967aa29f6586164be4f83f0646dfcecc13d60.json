(Courtesy of Mike Stevens/City of Salem, Va.)\n\nColumnist\n\nAmerican companies sell about $11 billion in textbooks each year. Why does social studies teacher Mark Ingerson never use them in his classes at Salem High School in Virginia?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t assign the old print volumes, nor the fashionable new online editions. He has James Q. Wilson and John J. Dilulio\u2019s much-praised \u201cAmerican Government: Institutions and Policies\u201d on shelves only because he read that the Advanced Placement program requires a textbook.\n\nHis students haven\u2019t had to lug home those doorstops in years. He didn\u2019t use them when he taught regular world history, nor does he now, his second year teaching AP U.S. Government and Politics. AP students might actually read them, but Ingerson doesn\u2019t want them to do that.\n\n\u201cI feel social studies textbooks are useless. Way too much information,\u201d Ingerson, 46, said. \u201cThey mention everything, therefore students remember nothing.\u201d A devotee of Daniel Willingham and Barak Rosenshine, experts on how children learn, Ingerson said, \u201cI believe without a shadow of a shred of a doubt that if you want students to think and analyze, you have to first master the basic content vocabulary and skills, and really practice them.\u201d\n\nI have known Ingerson a long time. His parents didn\u2019t go to college, but he was a summa cum laude graduate of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. He received a Milken Educator Award in 2005 (a top award for teachers), was a Virginia Region VI state teacher of the year in 2009, and is the coach of a forensics speech team that has won the state championship 14 times.\n\nThis past year teaching AP, he had each student compile 200 flashcards. They repeatedly paired up to quiz each other. \u201cI wanted students to know the material so well that if I said \u201cFederalist 10,\u201d literally any student could spout off three to four specific ideas that made that document important and could use that in an argument,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral big-city districts have gotten into trouble for having out-of-date textbooks, or sometimes no textbooks. But they might be better off if more teachers forsook textbooks for less prefabricated learning experiences.\n\nIngerson knows many teenagers will not master material on their own. Pairing up to review with friends is a popular break in every one of his classes. \u201cThey think it\u2019s fun,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen students master content and then are able to apply it, it\u2019s confidence- producing. It\u2019s far more meaningful and lasting than checking how many likes they got on Instagram.\u201d\n\n\n\nMark Ingerson uses original source material rather than textbooks in his social studies classes. (Courtesy of Mike Stevens/City of Salem, Va.)\n\nIf there are no textbooks, what do they read? \u201cReal articles from a variety of sources and just tons of data,\u201d he said. \u201cWe analyze polls, maps, economic data, budgets, etc., constantly.\u201d His students do \u201cclose reads of all primary sources, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Federalist Papers, excerpts from Supreme Court cases,\u201d he said. Vocabulary is absorbed through repeated practice: monetary vs. fiscal policy, Federal Reserve, Keynesian, supply-side.\n\n\u201cI show them quarterly GDP growth going back 30 to 40 years, and I pick out low growth parts and have student pairs discuss what the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy would be,\u201d he said. They can\u2019t be ready for a three-hour AP exam unless \u201cthey have mastered the terms and everything they mean.\u201d\n\nTelling even AP students to take lecture notes and read the textbook is often not enough. Ingerson\u2019s students study original sources and deeper articles. His high school encourages this. Trevor Packer, director of the College Board\u2019s AP program, said the program is putting out new free materials similar to what Ingerson is using. Packer said AP teachers do not need textbooks if their curriculum is as rich as Ingerson\u2019s.\n\nThe national average passing rate (percentage receiving grades of 3, 4 or 5) for the 2019 AP Government and Politics exam was 55 percent. The passing rate for Ingerson\u2019s 89 students, half 10th-graders and the rest 11th- and 12th-graders, was 93 percent.\n\nIn previous years as a world history teacher, he had 120 students in four classes. Ninety- five percent passed the Virginia Standards of Learning exam, half or more with advanced scores.\n\nJames Q. Wilson taught at my college when I got my degree in government. I read some of his books. He was a wonderful writer. But I would have learned more if I had had a chance to take Ingerson\u2019s course.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "He prefers using primary sources, polls, data and budgets.", "authors": ["Jay Mathews", "Education Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AkPelFukHKH4BR2ysXKpJ2jBgIk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J6YN6HHGEMI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
