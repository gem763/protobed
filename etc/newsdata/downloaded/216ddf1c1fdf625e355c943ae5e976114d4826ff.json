Not on my watch!\"\n\nSeveral other lawmakers also took the occasion to question the trustworthiness of the world's largest social network.\n\n\"In order to make a decision about Libra, we need to kind to dig into your past behaviour and Facebook's behaviour with respect to our democracy,\" said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who peppered Mr Zuckerberg with questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook's decision not to fact-check political ads.\n\nRepublican Representative Patrick McHenry offered a more sympathetic view, suggesting the Libra plan should be given the benefit of the doubt given that similar plans are being made in China and elsewhere.\n\n\"I have my qualms about Facebook and Libra ... but if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation,\" Mr McHenry said.\n\nCHINA VS AMERICAN 'LEADERSHIP'\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Mr Zuckerberg argued that the digital currency plan could help \"extend America's financial leadership\" and promote democratic values as other digital currencies emerge.\n\nDuring questioning, Mr Zuckerberg noted that a major competitive threat is coming from a Chinese public-private partnership and warned of risks if such a system became the global standard.\n\nIf that happens, he said, \"it would be very difficult if not impossible for us to impose our sanctions or the kinds of protections\" US policymakers would like to see.\n\nMr Zuckerberg was also grilled by several lawmakers on why the Libra Association is based in Switzerland rather than the United States.\n\nHe said Switzerland is important for the global financial system but added: \"This is still going to be an American innovation.\"\n\nRepublican Representative Lance Gooden countered that Mr Zuckerberg had \"enough influence to bring this home\" and said the plan might be better received if the association were based in the US.\n\nRegulators and officials on both sides of the Atlantic have criticised the Libra plan.\n\nThe G-7 said last week it should not launch \"until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks are adequately addressed.\"\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday a Libra launch would be \"premature,\" raising the need to address issues such as protection against money laundering and other illicit activity.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [WASHINGTON] Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg opened the door on Wednesday to scaling back plans for the company's digital coin Libra if it cannot win approval as a new currency for global exchanges. .
