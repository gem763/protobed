In those proceedings, Clinton was represented primarily by his private attorneys. Under Trump, the lines that should separate the president\u2019s personal interests from those of the American populace have blurred. Even as news reports have described Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, as being improperly enmeshed in diplomatic communications with Ukraine, lawyers for the Justice Department and the White House have taken dubious legal postures to impede lawful investigations of Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nRead more: Trump finally has his lawyer\n\nWhen an intelligence-community insider accused Trump of using American military aid as a lever to make Ukraine pursue a baseless investigation of Joe Biden and his son, for example, the governing statute legally obligated the acting director of national intelligence to hand over the complaint to Congress. Instead, Barr\u2019s Justice Department issued an irresponsible legal opinion to justify keeping the whistle-blower complaint from Congress\u2014despite the inspector general\u2019s official determination that the complaint was \u201ccredible\u201d and of \u201curgent concern,\u201d thereby triggering congressional oversight.\n\nThe whole purpose of inspectors general and whistle-blower laws\u2014which pre-date the Constitution itself\u2014is to make sure that legitimate insider information of wrongdoing within the executive branch sees the light of scrutiny by a co-equal branch of government. The laws exist to protect the public. Justice Department lawyers know this.\n\nThe latest troubling missive came from White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, whose October 8 memo lays out the president\u2019s rationale for keeping the entire executive branch from cooperating with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. In his letter to Congress, Cipollone advances a host of frivolous arguments. He insists that President Trump \u201ccannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under the circumstances,\u201d and that the inquiry \u201clacks any legitimate foundation\u201d under the Constitution. Cipollone goes on to posit that impeachment itself is constitutionally improper because it \u201cseek[s] to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen.\u201d\n\nThis gripe is one to take up with the Framers of the Constitution, which allows for the impeachment and removal of a president for grievous misconduct. The inquiry\u2019s legitimate foundation lies in Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, which states that the House \u201cshall have the sole power of impeachment.\u201d This is as black-and-white as the law gets.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not unprecedented for political appointees to back the president, Richard Nixon\u2019s attorney general, Elliot Richardson, resigned his post rather than execute a presidential directive that he fire the prosecutor charged with investigating his boss. Richardson\u2019s predecessor, John N. Mitchell, stood by the president, but went to jail for his Watergate-related crimes.", "description": "White House and Justice Department attorneys work for the government and the public\u2014but are acting in Trump\u2019s personal interest instead.", "authors": ["Kim Wehle", "Professor At The University Of Baltimore School Of Law"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX75YZM/facebook.jpg?1571424230", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
