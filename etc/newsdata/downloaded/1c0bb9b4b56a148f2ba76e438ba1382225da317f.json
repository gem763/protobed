Who's on the hook?\n\nYesterday, I commented Billionaire Epstein, Charged With Sex-Trafficking Teen Girls, May Name Names\n\nIn my posted I cited this Bloomberg article: Epstein Arrest Is a Worry for Donald Trump\n\nThe entire slant of the article seemed very biased against Trump. I commented:\n\nSpeculatively speaking, looking back to 2005 and 2006, is it more likely someone wanted to protect Bill Clinton or Trump? I don't know, nor does anyone else (except those who may have been directly involved). It's unwise to go down these lines of thoughts, I only did so to balance out the Bloomberg slant against Trump.\n\nFlight Logs\n\nTwo more articles came out today. Neither is damaging to Trump, and I am hardly a Trump defender in general.\n\nPlease consider Flight Logs Show Bill Clinton Flew on Sex Offender's Jet Much More than Previously Known.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender\u2019s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \u201cLolita Express\u201d -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. Clinton\u2019s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \u201cTatiana.\u201d The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls. \u201cBill Clinton \u2026 associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile,\u201d said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called \"TrafficKing.\" \u201cWhy would a former president associate with a man like that?\u201d Police in Palm Beach, Fla., launched a year-long investigation in 2005 into Epstein after parents of a 14-year-old girl said their daughter was sexually abused by him. Police interviewed dozens of witnesses, confiscated his trash, performed surveillance and searched his Palm Beach mansion, ultimately identifying 20 girls between the ages of 14 and 17 who they said were sexually abused by Epstein. In 2006, at the request of Palm Beach Police, the FBI launched a federal probe into allegations that Epstein and his personal assistants had \u201cused facilities of interstate commerce to induce girls between the ages of 14 and 17 to engage in illegal sexual activities.\u201d According to court documents, police investigators found a \u201cclear indication that Epstein\u2019s staff was frequently working to schedule multiple young girls between the ages of 12 and 16 years old literally every day, often two or three times per day.\u201d\n\nSpeculation\n\nOnce again, I caution against speculation, but at least this speculation comes accompanied with flight log evidence.\n\nSome might object to the above article since it is from Fox News.\n\nOK. Please consider Vanity Fair.\n\nVanity Fair\n\nPerhaps the most revealing commentary Donald Trump has offered on Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who pleaded not guilty this week to sex trafficking and conspiracy, occurred in late February 2015, onstage at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump, then flirting with a presidential run, was fielding softballs from Fox News host Sean Hannity when a lightning round of questions turned to a favorite topic: Bill Clinton. \u201cNice guy, Trump said. \u201cGot a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island with Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d he added, seemingly veering off topic. \u201cLot of problems.\u201d Trump isn\u2019t known to have gone on any trips with Epstein, which would have been out of character. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump would go to someone else\u2019s property or someone else\u2019s island or villa,\u201d Nunberg said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even play golf at anyone else\u2019s clubs.\u201d\n\nOther portions of the article attempted to smear Trump but the attacks came across poorly, especially in light of the above direct quotes.\n\nI suspect this will not be swept under the rug this time and I certainly hope it won't, no matter who is guilty.", "description": "The Epstein sex scandal gets increasingly curious every day.
