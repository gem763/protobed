While the identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, we do know that he or she is an employee of the U.S. Government. As such, he or she has by law the right \u2014 and indeed the responsibility \u2014 to make known, through appropriate channels, indications of serious wrongdoing. That is precisely what this whistleblower did; and we applaud the whistleblower not only for living up to that responsibility but also for using precisely the channels made available by federal law for raising such concerns.\n\n\u201cA responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed, thus advancing the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers. What\u2019s more, being a responsible whistleblower means that, by law, one is protected from certain egregious forms of retaliation. Whatever one\u2019s view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity. Simply put, he or she has done what our law demands; now he or she deserves our protection.\u201d\n\nOfficials who signed the letter include former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel. It also included a number of former ambassadors and former officials at the CIA, State Department and Defense Department.\n\nEarlier Sunday, the attorney for the whistleblower said a second individual has come forward with firsthand knowledge of Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings. While that person has not yet filed an official complaint, they have spoken to the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog and can corroborate the original whistleblower\u2019s complaint, the Associated Press reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump and his allies continued their attacks against the whistleblowers.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to \u2018more whistleblowers coming forward\u2019..............I\u2019ve seen this movie before \u2014 with Brett #Kavanaugh,\u201d tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham. \u201cMore and more doesn\u2019t mean better or reliable.\u201d\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump on Sunday night called the anonymous whistleblower \u201chighly partisan\u201d and said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff were guilty of \u201ctreason\u201d and should be \u201cimpeached.\u201d", "description": "A group of former national security officials expressed their support for the anonymous U.S. official who blew the whistle on President Donald Trump\u2019s...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS746_19trum_ZG_20191006230253.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
