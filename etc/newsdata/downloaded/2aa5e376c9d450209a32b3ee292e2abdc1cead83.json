They said the planet likely has a large amount of water embedded in the planet\u2019s surface, though scientists aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s an icy or rocky planet.\n\nThis is the first planet to be found in the habitable zone, also known as the \u201cGoldilocks zone,\u201d to contain water; previously water had only been found in Jupiter\u2019s gases.\n\nMr. Tsiaras stressed that this is not a new Earth, but it opens up many other possibilities.\n\n\u201cIt is significantly heavier, and it has a different atmospheric composition,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it brings us closer to answering the fundamental question: Is the Earth unique?\u201d\n\nThe planet orbits a red dwarf star and is estimated to have a temperature of -73 to 46 degrees Celsius.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
