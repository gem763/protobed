But as clashes between the White House and Congress grow more acrimonious, the real political drama is unfolding at a whisper level at the Supreme Court, just a few blocks away.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts signaled last week that his court would hear some of the most contentious \u2013 and potentially explosive \u2013 cases of the Trump era. Liberal court-watchers already fear the lasting political damage a revivified conservative court might cause.\n\nIn an era of political hyperpolarization, activists are rightfully concerned about ideological justices denying discrimination protection to LGBTQ Americans or relitigating the landmark 1973 abortion decision Roe v. Wade.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe court embarks on these sensitive cases at a challenging time for its credibility. Democrats, including presidential frontrunner Sen.

Now, on the verge of victory, McConnell and the Republicans have dispensed with any fiction that the Supreme Court is an impartial deliberative body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed how a lot of the judges that we have already confirmed just in the last two and a half years have voted in these cases,\u201d McConnell said of federal decisions on Trump\u2019s recent defunding of Planned Parenthood and a controversial Alabama law that effectively bans abortion. \u201cI think it\u2019s the single biggest contribution we made to changing America in the future.\u201d\n\nYou know why we put you there, McConnell and his cronies emphasize without a hint of concern for how their cynical rhetoric corrodes public trust in the federal courts. McConnell\u2019s expectation of a judicial quid pro quo was always the price of admission to America\u2019s highest court. Only under Trump has the fa\u00e7ade fallen away.\n\nConservatives wave away concerns about the court\u2019s legitimacy as so much doomsaying from Democratic sore losers. They point to Chief Justice Roberts, and specifically to the image rehabilitation Roberts underwent after casting the deciding vote to protect Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Could a guy who sided with Obama really be accused of partisanship?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn one front, the conservative voices are right: Democrats now hold a favorable view of John Roberts, and tend to view Roberts as not overtly partisan. He has publicly joined liberal critics in expressing concern about the legitimacy of the court \u2014 and positioned himself as the chief defender of precedent and protocol. On one occasion, Roberts even criticized Donald Trump. By the low standards of the Trump era, Roberts is practically a member of the Resistance.\n\nBut as Aaron Belkin and Sean McElwee point out in a recent New York Times op-ed, Roberts is simply a less overt partisan operator than Neil Gorsuch Neil GorsuchHarris says Trump should be in 'timeout' from appointing a Supreme Court justice Supreme Court grapples with LGBTQ rights in the workplace House leaders ask Supreme Court to reject Trump challenge to consumer bureau MORE, Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Planned Parenthood plans M campaign for 2020 | Dem candidates embrace aggressive step on drug prices | Officials propose changes to encourage 'value-based' care Bans on public coverage for abortion are unjustified by science and outright harmful GOP requests update on criminal referrals prompted by 2018 Kavanaugh probe MORE or Clarence Thomas Clarence ThomasSupreme Court session begins without ill Clarence Thomas Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks Supreme Court to hear Louisiana abortion case MORE: \u201cIn all 42 split-decision cases that the chief justice has presided over involving racial minorities, immigrants, workers and abortion,\u201d Belkin and McElwee note, \u201che voted for conservative outcomes 100 percent of the time.\u201d\n\nSo much for the Resistance.\n\nBelkin and McElwee propose expanding the Supreme Court to counteract the partisan influence of Trump\u2019s recent appointments. That view is gaining new traction among Democrats tired of adhering to political tradition as a Republican Senate and White House run roughshod over every rule of procedure they once claimed to uphold.\n\nExpanding the Supreme Court is more politically feasible than impeaching Brett Kavanaugh, regardless of how clearly deserving Kavanaugh is of removal.

It merits serious consideration as the foundation of any decision to alter the structure of the court.\n\nNone of this was inevitable. McConnell and Senate Republicans could have followed time-tested procedures and given Merrick Garland an up-or-down vote. That alone would have dissolved the skepticism and bad feelings that now threaten to cast any Supreme Court decision as unduly influenced by backroom partisan deals.\n\nInstead, McConnell chose power, and as a result the Supreme Court stands poised to make monumental decisions about personhood and women\u2019s rights while its credibility with regular Americans sits near all-time lows. How the court approaches its most challenging term in decades will determine whether it needs significant structural reform under the next Democratic administration.\n\nDon\u2019t be too optimistic.\n\nMax Burns is a veteran Democratic strategist and senior contributor at Millennial Politics.
