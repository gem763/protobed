At a recent event, Biden started outlining his child tax credit plan, which would offer $8,000 in tax credit for everyone with child care costs. He was pleased to share that it would increase the GDP and it would grow the economy. But he started struggling a bit with math when he announced how many women his plan would help reenter the workforce.\n\nDespite a US population of only 330 million, Joe Biden says child tax credit would put 720 million women back into the workforce.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s like double the population of the US. pic.twitter.com/DgChhZRzFl \u2014 Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) September 17, 2019\n\nSome social media users joked that perhaps he was counting the \"illegals\" in the country. It was an honest mistake, but his error made news because it's come in a string of other examples of him misspeaking, stuttering, or plain forgetting.\n\nPresident Trump offered his opinion of Biden's mental faculties, telling White House press that it sounds like the former VP is \"not playing with a full deck.\"\n\nHis Democratic opponents have used the same line of attack. Former HUD Secretary Julian Castro embarrassed Biden onstage last week by asking him whether he had forgotten what he had said just a few moments before about health care.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) pounced too, wondering if Biden had the gusto to even finish the campaign without \"fumbling.\"\n\nSen. Cory Booker on Juli\u00e1n Castro's jab at former VP Joe Biden's memory: \"Castro has some really legitimate concerns about, can he be someone in a long grueling campaign that can get the ball over the line? And he has every right to call that out.\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rMvlolVf0j \u2014 OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 13, 2019\n\nBiden is still the frontrunner, but his opponents are gaining supporters and gaining in the polls.\n\nAsked by campaign reporters to address concerns about his mental health, Biden said he'd be happy to release his medical records.", "description": ".09/18/2019 19:18:38PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/3b1cd4b5-63bc-475a-8130-9f3205274dd8.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
