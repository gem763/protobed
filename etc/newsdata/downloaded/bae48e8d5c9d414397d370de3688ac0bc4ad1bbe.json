Should a parent interfere?\n\nHer 11-year-old daughter\u2019s friends have begun to ignore her, a mom wrote on YOU SuperMom\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been sidelined and spends school breaks alone. My daughter is a quiet, shy child with a lovely nature. It breaks my heart that she\u2019s alone at school.\u201d\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nPeople tend to think bullying is physical. But isolating someone by not playing with her or telling friends to ignore her is one of the cruellest ways of bullying, says Anel Annandale, an educational psychologist in Cape Town. It\u2019s one of the most common types of bullying among teenage girls. Among boys, bullying is likely to take the form of pushing the victim around or hitting him.\n\nBut things aren\u2019t as grim as the 11-year old girl\u2019s mom feels. The fact the girl had the freedom to tell her mom about her problems is already a step in the right direction, says Claire O\u2019Mahoney of the Sandton Psychology Centre in Johannesburg. Also, this is part of the stage of life when children sometimes feel left out.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the girl\u2019s psychosocial development, she\u2019s in the phase when children find out where and with whom they feel at home. Relationships with friends play a big role in their emotional development. They often feel shut out while relationships are still forming and changing.\u201d\n\nHow to help your child\n\nBuild her self-image. \u201cContinue to support her emotionally. It\u2019s important for her to build up enough self-confidence to stay away from such \u2018friends\u2019 and mix with children who welcome her,\u201d O\u2019Mahoney says.\n\nHelp her to create other support networks. \u201cIt\u2019s important that other people in her life support her to counteract the rejection,\u201d Annandale says. They could be relatives or family friends\u2019 children of her age.\n\nTeach her how to confront the nasty kids. \u201cShe must be able to tell these girls what they\u2019re doing is mean,\u201d Annandale says.\n\nHelp her to understand her circumstances aren\u2019t unique; she might come across such people again later in life, O\u2019Mahoney says. The most important thing is not to try to force the other girls to change their behaviour but that she should decide how to handle the situation.\n\nThe parent\u2019s role\n\nEncourage your child to play with school friends at weekends, Annandale says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for her to get to know other children in her class or school and form a bond with them outside school,\u201d O\u2019Mahoney adds. \u201cBecause she\u2019s quiet and shy she should perhaps make friends with children who make her feel at ease rather than those whose personalities will dominate hers.\u201d\n\nInvolve the school. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for parents to know when to take action but it\u2019s important for the school to know about bullying so they can monitor it,\u201d O\u2019Mahoney says. You don\u2019t have to tell someone at school yourself; you can encourage your child to discuss it with a teacher or the school psychologist. They might be able to help with a strategy that will solve the problem.\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t help, approach your child\u2019s class teacher or the headmaster. \u201cChildren must be made aware of their duty to stop such cruel behaviour. If the other children notice such behaviour they must make an effort to include her and tell the other girls their behaviour is wrong,\u201d Annandale says.\n\nRead more:\n\n\"Pray for him, don't judge\": Readers react to Grantleigh school\u2019s \u2018demonic\u2019 art display\n\nSending these WhatsApp messages to your friends could soon get you sent to jail\n\n\n\n", "description": "A worried mom says her child is being excluded and rejected at school.
