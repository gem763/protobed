Exencephaly typically means the developing brain is exposed to amniotic fluid and other damaging complications in the womb.\n\nOREGON DOCTOR SUES OVER DONATED SPERM, SAYS CLINIC USED IT FOR 17 KIDS\n\n\u201cExencephaly is where the brain is outside of the skull, and it\u2019s usually only covered by a thin layer of skin made up of one or two cells,\u201d Dr. Tim Vogel, chief of pediatric neurosurgery at North Jersey Brain and Spine Center, told Fox News. \u201cThere\u2019s just enough protection of the brain, but it\u2019s usually not functional. All other cases aside from Lucas are not survivable.\u201d\n\nWhich is what Lucas\u2019 mother, Maria Santa Maria, was told and had been preparing her three daughters for.\n\nVogel found out about the case right before Lucas' birth, when he heard one of his colleagues at Hackensack University Medical Center walking down the hall toward the Santa Maria family\u2019s room to discuss palliative care.\n\n\u201cI said, 'Tell me more about the case, maybe there is something we can do,'\u201d he said.\n\nVogel said he explained to the family that if Lucas survived birth, and he was showing promising signs, they might be able to design a surgery that could spare his healthy brain tissue from the non-functioning tissue, and possibly put him on a path to thrive. Lucas was born breathing on his own, and began eating, opening the door for Vogel and his team to work a possible miracle.\n\n\u201cIt was a delicate dance between what we can do and what we need to save,\u201d Vogel said, explaining that the hours-long surgery at Hackensack University Medical Center included separating vessels to ensure that Lucas did not suffer a stroke, or lose any of the brain functionality that he had.\n\nSECONDARY INFERTILITY: WHY IT HAPPENS TO COUPLES WHO HAVE ALREADY HAD SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCIES\n\nVogel\u2019s team also had to preserve the spinal fluid cavity so that the brain would be protected once they were done, and prevent any infection from setting in. Vogel explained that the dura, which is the brain\u2019s outermost membrane, has the ability to form bones in children under the age of 18 months.\n\nSince the operation, Vogel said bone is starting to form a protective layer around the brain, and that the scalp has grown over it, complete with hair. Future surgeries will include taking the bone currently growing and shaping it around other areas that are lacking, which makes the timing tricky.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to interrupt Lucas\u2019 neurodevelopment \u2014 he\u2019s on the same path that a child his age would normally be,\u201d Vogel said, adding that he\u2019s started eating baby cereal and baby food. \u201cWe intervene with the best intentions and then possibly delay someone\u2019s recovery \u2014 I don\u2019t want to stunt his growth or neurodevelopment.\u201d\n\nIn the future, Vogel said they will work with his family on cosmetic goals as well but that he has normal facial features, meaning the area the will need to address is the top of his skull. He added that the more bone he develops the more of his own tissue they can use, which will \u201clead to a better outcome.\u201d\n\nVogel said the waiting has also paid off, as at a recent visit with Lucas he was lifting his head and trying to crawl, which is something a babies typically master between six and 10 months of age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable for a child with one hemisphere, half a brain \u2014 it\u2019s just amazing,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a night and day difference from what they told the family was going to happen \u2014 it\u2019s just fantastic to see it really is.\u201d\n\nVogel said his young patient is \u201ca story of hope,\u201d and that when other families facing a tough diagnosis turn to the internet to find information he hopes Lucas serves as an inspiration.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cLucas is a message of hope \u2014 it\u2019s heartwarming but also an inspiration,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cSo much good can come from this.\u201d", "description": "\u201cLucas is a message of hope \u2014 it\u2019s heartwarming but also an inspiration,\u201d Dr. Vogel said. \u201cSo much good can come from this.\u201d", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/lucas_1.jpeg"}
