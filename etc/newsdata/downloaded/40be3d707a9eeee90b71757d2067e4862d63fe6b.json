There were also early reports of civilian casualties in border towns hit by shelling. Pictures and video shared on social media showed wrecked buildings and bodies in the rubble.\n\nTurkey\u2019s offensive was triggered by a call between Donald Trump and Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, on Sunday, in which, the Turks claim, Trump handed over leadership of the campaign against Isis in Syria to Ankara. The American president announced on Sunday night that US troops would withdraw from the region.\n\nG\u00fclnur Aybet, one of the Turkish president\u2019s senior advisers, told CNN: \u201cPresident Trump and President Erdo\u011fan have reached an understanding over precisely what this operation is.\u201d Aybet added that Trump \u201cknows what the scope of this operation is\u201d.\n\nHours after the bombing began, Trump issued a statement mildly criticising the offensive aimed at Kurdish forces, which for nearly five years fought alongside the US against Isis.\n\n\u201cThe United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,\u201d the statement said, before noting: \u201cThere are no American soldiers in the area.\u201d\n\nIn remarks later, Trump presented the invasion as a historical inevitability, saying Turks and Kurds \u201chave been fighting each other for centuries\u201d. And he downplayed the US debt to Kurdish fighters, saying: \u201cThey didn\u2019t help us in the second world war, they didn\u2019t help us with Normandy \u2026 but they\u2019re there to help us with their land.\u201d\n\nThe UN security council is due to convene on Thursday to discuss the offensive at the request of its five current European members, but it is not expected to deliver a strong rebuke to Turkey, given tacit Russian support and US ambivalence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan speaks on video phone with the Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, to give the order for an operation in Kurdish areas in northern Syria on Wednesday.

I will discuss this issue with President Erdo\u011fan Friday.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish leader marked the launch of the offensive, dubbed Operation Peace Spring, with a tweet, saying that it was being conducted by Turkish and Turkish-backed Syrian militias, against Kurdish forces and Isis.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTurkey says it is seeking to establish a 20-mile (32km) deep buffer zone along the border against the threat of what it says are Kurdish terror groups as well as Isis. It also hopes to resettle Syrian refugees in the zone.\n\nMustafa Bali, spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 which Ankara considers an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) \u2013 confirmed shortly after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s announcement that Turkish warplanes had already begun attacking the region, creating a \u201chuge panic among people\u201d.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said civilians in Ras al-Ayn and neighbouring villages had begun fleeing deeper inside the Kurdish-held region. Key administrative centres for the SDF were hit by airstrikes, a spokesman said.\n\nIn his statement on Wednesday, Trump said: \u201cTurkey is now responsible for ensuring all Isis fighters being held captive remain in prison and that Isis does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form.\u201d\n\nTrump later suggested the US had extricated some of the Isis detainees held by Kurdish forces ahead of the offensive.\n\n\u201cWe are taking some of the most dangerous Isis fighters out \u2026 and we\u2019re putting them in different locations where it\u2019s secure,\u201d the president said. Asked about what would happen to the captured European Isis fighters, Trump said: \u201cWell, they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe. That\u2019s where they want to go. They want to go back to their homes.\u201d\n\nHe said he had given European governments repeated opportunities to take custody of their own nationals who had been caught in Isis ranks, but they had refused. European officials said they had been in talks with the US about arranging prosecutions of European Isis fighters in the region \u2013 most likely Iraq \u2013 on the grounds that European courts would release them on due process grounds.\n\nBut it is far from clear how Turkey would take custody of the 90,000 men, women and children with links to the terror group currently held by the Kurds.\n\nThe largest camp for women and children, al-Hawl, is home to 74,000 people, and lies outside the parameters of the proposed safe zone.\n\nHassan Hassan, an expert on Isis at the Centre for Global Policy, said the terror group was bound to benefit from Turkey\u2019s incursion.\n\n\u201cThe SDF had fresh and raw intelligence on people who joined Isis and the structures of Isis. Now Turkey comes in and doesn\u2019t have access to much of this information,\u201d Hassan, co-author of Isis: Inside the Army of Terror, said. He added: \u201cThe areas in Syria currently controlled by Turkey are full of corruption, more corrupt even than regime areas. Isis would have no trouble buying loyalty, paying bribes to escape. So definitely Isis will have new opportunities.\u201d\n\nIsis claimed an overnight suicide attack by two of its fighters in its former capital of Raqqa, which killed or injured 25 people.\n\nThe SDF, a US-backed force, is Turkey\u2019s main target.\n\nAs Turkish forced massed to the north, forces belonging to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, have also been on the move to the south of Syria\u2019s Kurdish-held region, leaving the SDF pinched between the two.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into Syria on Wednesday in Akcakale, Turkey.

Asked what that meant, the president replied: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to define that as we go along.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have serious concerns about the unilateral military action that Turkey has taken,\u201d the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said. \u201cThis risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering, and undermining the progress made against Daesh [Isis], which should be our collective focus.\u201d\n\nWomen and children expected to 'break out' from al-Hawl camp Read more\n\nDowning Street said Boris Johnson had spoken to Trump about the offensive, noting only that: \u201cThe leaders expressed their serious concern at Turkey\u2019s invasion of north-east Syria and the risk of a humanitarian catastrophe in the region.\u201d\n\nAid groups have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe as thousands flee the expected fighting and re-emergence of Isis. The SDF says it has already withdrawn some soldiers from the prisons and camps holding Isis members to focus on the defence against Turkey, raising fears that Isis sleeper cells could liberate those inside.", "description": "Civilians flee as airstrikes and artillery hit border region as Trump says about Kurds: \u2018They didn\u2019t help us in Normandy\u2019", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan", "Julian Borger", "Dan Sabbagh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1682302be6c03cffa9ffc6bcd16db3b1a1c8cb53/0_83_5062_3037/master/5062.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ffcbfb2daeef1a847df25e79162772f6", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
