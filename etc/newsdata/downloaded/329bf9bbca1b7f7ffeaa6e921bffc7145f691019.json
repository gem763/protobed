Smith also appeared in the 2003 Affleck-starring \"Daredevil\" film.\n\nExecutive Producer Stan Lee, from left, with cast members Ben Affleck and Kevin Smith pose in the lobby at the premiere of \"Daredevil\" at the Village Theatre on Feb. 9, 2003 in Los Angeles, California.

They were put on the road to reconciliation by entertainment journalist Kevin McCarthy, who, during an interview with Affleck for the Netflix film \"Triple Frontier\" asked Affleck if he'd been contacted for the in-the-works \"Reboot\" yet. Affleck said he had not but was available.\n\nFollowing the urging of Jason Mewes, the Jay to his Silent Bob, as well as producer Jordan Monsanto and Smith's wife Jennifer Schwalbach, the director texted Affleck. A few tense moments later, followed by an exchange that included \"Conan the Barbarian\" and \"Say Anything\" references, Affleck had agreed to be in the movie, already weeks into shooting.\n\nSmith then enlisted Affleck's \"Chasing Amy\" co-star, Joey Lauren Adams, and on the last day of shooting in New Orleans, \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\" suddenly received a miniature \"Amy\" sequel that serves as the heart of the new film.\n\nFor the uninitiated, or those who need a refresher, \"Chasing Amy\" was the story of Holden, a New Jersey indie comics creator, who falls in love with fellow writer/artist Alyssa.\n\nJay and Silent Bob, as established in \"Chasing Amy,\" are the inspiration for Holden's comic book series \"Bluntman and Chronic.\" While \"Strike Back\" found them traveling to Hollywood to stop a \"Bluntman and Chronic\" movie from being made, in \"Reboot\" they learn a new \"Bluntman and Chronic\" is being made by, yes, Kevin Smith. They hit the road again, this time joined by Jay's daughter, played by Smith's daughter Harley Quinn Smith.\n\nEven though he appears in \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\" as both himself and Silent Bob, reviving the character of Holden, Smith explained, afforded him the opportunity to directly address criticisms of his work that have come up in recent years.\n\n\u201cSince Holden is the closest character to me, it allows me to jump into the movie and defend myself for casting my kid. He gives a very eloquent defense,\" Smith said. \"Some people out there are like, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s working with (his) kid now.\u2019 And Ben, very eloquently, kind of explains it. And through the character of Holden I get to say, \u2018Look, this is who I am now, I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\u2019 \"\n\n\"Chasing Amy\" is a complicated love story between Holden, a straight man, and Alyssa, who has involved with both men and women in the past. While \"Chasing Amy\" was critically acclaimed upon release and earned Adams a Golden Globe nomination, its views of sexuality have been called into question by some. Alyssa is identified as a lesbian in the film, but her actions show her to likely be bisexual or pansexual.\n\n\"This is a movie that some people feel has not aged well and some cats are like, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s a problematic movie at this point,\u2019 \" Smith said. \"Which was always so disheartening because \u2018Chasing Amy\u2019 was the one movie of all the ones I\u2019ve made that most people would be like, \u2018Alright, at least he did that. He may have went to hell with the walrus thing (2014's 'Tusk'), but he made Chasing Amy.\u2019\n\nUltimately the late-in-the-game \"Reboot\" re-visitation of those characters became, in Smith's words, \"one of my favorite scenes I\u2019ve ever written and hands-down the best scene in the movie that never existed when we started making this movie.\u201d\n\nJason Mewes as Jay, left, and Kevin Smith as Silent Bob in the comedy \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,\" a Saban Films release. (Photo: KYLE KAPLAN)\n\nIt's the sort of deep, emotional reward that's possible when pulling together threads from a quarter century's worth of stories.\n\n\"So it\u2019s an unfair nostalgia bomb of a movie, right? The table is tilted, the game is rigged, because we know once you come in we can press all of your nostalgia buttons and you\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, this feels good, I love going to back in time.\u2019 \"\n\nBut Smith, who suffered a massive, life-changing heart attack in 2018, had more on his mind than cheap throw-back pops with this film. Instead, he uses the character of Jay and his newfound fatherhood to discuss the need for growth and personal evolution, even in a popular culture obsessed with its own past.\n\n\"It was important to take the story forward and really take the character forward,\" said Smith. \"If \u2018Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\u2019 is a movie where a cartoon character meets a woman and she turns him into a two-dimensional person, \u2018Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\u2019 is about how a two-dimensional guy meets another woman, who happens to be the daughter for the first woman, and she turns him into a three-dimensional person, she grows him up.\u201d\n\nAre you all about arts and entertainment?
