And it\u2019s why the company has raised $7 million in financing led by Casa Verde Capital \u2014 the investment firm launched by legendary cannabis aficionado, Calvin Broadus (AKA Snoop Dogg).\n\nIn some ways, George Mancheril is the new face of the cannabis business. The former banker hails from Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Partners and worked on the desks that dealt with alternative lending.\n\nA transplant to Los Angeles roughly six years ago, Mancheril says he saw the migration of legally sanctioned cannabis begin for recreational use and knew there would be opportunities for new lending businesses.\n\n\u201cCannabis will become a broad, mature industry just like any other, and if that is going to happen, there needs to be a debt structure that can support that,\u201d Mancheril says.\n\nThe biggest impediment to the industry\u2019s growth is the one that Bespoke Financial wants to tackle first \u2014 and that\u2019s access to debt.\n\nTo build the company\u2019s first product, Mancheril looked to his co-founder\u2019s Pablo Borquez-Schwarzbeck and Benjamin Dusastre. Borquez-Schwarzbeck and Dusastre previously launched ProducePay, a fintech platform focused on produce farmers that has financed roughly $2 billion in perishable commodities throughout 13 countries. It\u2019s backed by around $200 million in venture capital and debt financing.\n\nWhat Mancheril and his co-founders have done is take ProducePay\u2019s underwriting model and apply it to the cannabis industry. The financial instrument that they\u2019re starting with is known \u201cin the business\u201d as factoring.\n\nIt\u2019s basically advancing money to businesses for a contract that\u2019s signed in exchange for a cut of the money once a company gets paid for the goods or services they\u2019ve rendered.\n\n\u201cWhile the US legal cannabis market is forecasted to grow over 20% annually, reaching $23B by 2022, the industry\u2019s true growth potential is limited by long cash flow cycles throughout the supply chain and a lack of scalable and efficient capital sources,\u201d says Bespoke Financial co-founder and chief executive, George Mancheril, in a statement. \u201cOur approach will dramatically improve cash flow cycles across the supply chain and provide scalable working capital to fuel our clients\u2019 growth.\u201d\n\nThe $7 million infusion from investors, including Casa Verde, Greenhouse Capital Partners and Outbound Ventures, will be used to build out the company\u2019s business and establish its first credit lines with customers. Mancheril says it already has around $3 million worth of loans revolving through its business. Right now, the company is focused on California, but says it could expand to other regions that are embracing legalization.\n\n\u201cIn general, in the cannabis industry overall, it\u2019s difficult to access any part of the financial system,\u201d says Karan Wadhera, a managing director at Casa Verde. \u201cNow that we\u2019re moving into a place where equity financing is getting expensive, a company like Bespoke plays an important and valuable role in the ecosystem to help young brands and mature brands get access to working capital when they need it the most.\u201d", "description": "Bespoke Financial wants to provide cannabis businesses with the same kind of financial services that other businesses get, but that dispensaries and growers can\u2019t yet access.
