Pamela has to sleep in another bed.\u2019\n\nHis wife still comes in to plump his pillows each night though, as the Scotsman known as The Big Yin \u2013 now based in Florida \u2013 was worried he was becoming a pain.\n\n\u2018So far, she has never tutted,\u2019 he added of his 69-year-old wife. \u2018And she\u2019s a rather attractive nurse.\u2019\n\nThe pair have been married for 30 years (Picture: PA Wire)\n\nThe star, who is still working on his TV shows, despite stepping back from performing his stand-up routines due to the condition, said he has \u2018good days and bad days\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018One day my hearing went, then my balance went, my sight got worse,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018It feels as if everything is being taken away from you and you watch it go.\u2019\n\nEarlier this year Billy bleakly said he felt his life was \u2018slipping away\u2019 as he battled the incurable disease.\n\n\u2018My life, it\u2019s slipping away and I can feel it and I should. I\u2019m 75, I\u2019m near the end,\u2019 he said earlier this year on his documentary Made In Scotland.\n\nHe\u2019s still busy working (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a damn sight nearer the end than I am the beginning. But it doesn\u2019t frighten me, it\u2019s an adventure and it is quite interesting to see myself slipping away.\u2019\n\nAt one point, Billy had to stop filming as talking about it became too emotional.\n\n\u2018Parkinson\u2019s is strange because it\u2019s not gonna go away,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018All my life I\u2019ve got sick, I\u2019ve had flu and various things and they all went away. This isn\u2019t going anywhere. This is gonna get worse.\u2019\n\nBilly added: \u2018It takes a certain calm to deal with. I sometimes don\u2019t have it. I sometimes get angry with it, but that doesn\u2019t last long.\n\n\u2018The love you have for people is still there and with a bit of luck the love they have for you is still there.\u2019\n\nAfter his comments worried fans, Billy was quick to note he was not dying and we all needed to calm down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPamela later shared a video of her hubby singing a song about his recent confession where he reassures fans that he is \u2018not dying.\u2019\n\nWhile strumming on the guitar, he can be heard singing: \u2018Not dying, not dead, not slipping away.\n\n\u2018Sorry if I depressed you. Maybe I should have phrased it better.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
