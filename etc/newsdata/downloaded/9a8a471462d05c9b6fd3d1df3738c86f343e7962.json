To date the school has raised \u00a33,000 - and the military fun run alone raised \u00a32,000.\n\n'On the day the children made it through the wet ground and over obstacles, they were a real credit to themselves.'\n\nThe 48-year-old deputy headteacher added: 'It was just brilliant - there is no doubt it is Amy who made them this resilient.\n\n'This is really about kids supporting their teacher, she was the first teacher a lot of these kids ever had.\n\n'Parents are so appreciative of her input into their children\u2019s\u2019 lives. They all want her back and she will get back in time.\n\n'Amy has left a lasting impression in everybody she has come across, that is parents and children, they say where is Miss Pohl when is she coming back?'\n\nAs well as the mud run, the school - which teaches 300 children - has raised funds through a recent summer fair and tombola.\n\nAs well as the mud run, the school - which teaches 300 children - has raised funds through a recent summer fair and tombola (pictured, two parents of some of Miss Pohl's former pupils)\n\nMiss Pohl's father said she is desperate to get back to the job and school she loves but it could be sometime before she is fit to work again (pictured, two of Miss Pohl's former pupils taking part in the fun run)\n\nMiss Pohl's mother, Jo, is pictured holding a sign saying 'Good luck' at the fun run\n\nMr Pohl said his daughter is desperate to get back to the job and school she loves but it could be sometime before she is fit to work again.\n\nThe 26-year-old is currently undergoing rehabilitation at the private Neurological Rehabilitation Centre, STEPS, in Sheffield.\n\nShe is currently undergoing seven days a week of treatment with the aim of getting her to be able to walk again.\n\nMr Pohl said: 'Amy\u2019s \"hardware\" is working but the \"software\" is not, the signals from her brain are not doing what they should.\n\n'Most people who have been away from work for two years would have been forgotten about but not Amy.\n\n'But Amy is measuring her recovery purely based on when she will be able to get back to the school.\n\nCRPS' exact prevalence is unclear, however, a study claimed up to one in 3,800 people in the UK develop the condition each year (Miss Pohl is pictured in hospital)\n\nDoctors are unsure what caused the condition. Her family claim she developed it following an infection in her hand from a failed cannula insertion (pictured after the cannula insertion)\n\n'She was the first teacher to be appointed at Rugby Free Primary School, she got a first class degree in teaching. She would give anything for this not to have happened.\n\n'I think there is no doubt she could even have been an assistant headteacher if her career had not been interrupted by this debilitating condition.'\n\nDoctors are unsure what caused the condition, though Miss Pohl's family claim she developed the condition in her left arm following an infection in her hand.\n\nShe began to feel run down in November 2017 and was diagnosed with adult croup - an infection that affects the windpipe, airways and voice box.\n\nAfter antibiotics failed to clear the infection up, Miss Pohl was admitted to hospital in December for more tests.\n\nShe later suffered a near-fatal reaction to her medication and was rushed to intensive care.\n\nAround a week later, Miss Pohl developed an infection after a failed cannula insertion, which caused her hand and wrist to swell up.\n\nCRPS' exact prevalence is unclear, however, a study claimed up to one in 3,800 people in the UK develop the condition each year.\n\nAnd in the US, between 5.5 and 26.2 people suffer from CRPS per 100,000 every year.\n\nTo donate: go to www.help-amy.co.uk\n\nAnyone seeking help can call Samaritans 24/7 for free on 116 123 or visit Samaritans.org", "description": "Amy Pohl, 26,\u00a0worked at Rugby Primary Free School for two years when it opened its doors five years ago.
