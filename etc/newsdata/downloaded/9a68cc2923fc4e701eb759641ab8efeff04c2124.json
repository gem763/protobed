I will pay you smiling,\" added the president, known for his brutal anti-drug crackdown that has claimed thousands of lives.\n\nNearly 2,000 prisoners have been released over the last few years, including those convicted of heinous crimes who were found to be ineligible for a law that rewards good behaviour with shorter jail time.\n\nThe law went into effect in 2014, two years before Duterte was elected president.\n\nThe premature releases had gone largely unremarked until news broke last month that a former politician convicted in the 1990s and sentenced to decades behind bars in a notorious rape and murder case was about to get out early for good behaviour.\n\nEarlier this month Duterte fired the prisons chief over the early releases, saying: \"The records would show that there has been a wrong committed and maybe corruption.\"\n\nAt least 400 ex-prisoners have surrendered over the past two weeks, according to police. Their cases will be reviewed by authorities with a view to returning them to prison.", "description": "More than a thousand ex-prisoners prematurely freed under a controversial law in the Philippines will be captured \"dead or alive\" if they do not surrender before a Thursday deadline, President Rodrigo Duterte said.
