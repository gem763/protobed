Some costs of the telecom system, he said, are the same no matter how many customers are served.\n\n\u201cWhen we first proposed LUS Fiber, we sought to provide Lafayette residents and businesses with the best telecommunications products and services available,\" Huval said in a news release.\n\n\"From the beginning, many neighboring communities asked LUS Fiber to extend its fiber lines to their communities. Now, LUS Fiber\u2019s financial success allows us to expand outside of the Lafayette city limits. By expanding to these initial developments in Youngsville and Broussard, LUS Fiber will bring its same powerful complement of competitive services to these residents.\"\n\nMore: Body of abducted Shreveport woman found in St. Landry Parish lake\n\nMayor-President Joel Robideaux said he hopes this is the first step toward LUS Fiber expanding its offerings throughout the parish.\n\n\u201cStrategic growth and expansion is an important focus for any successful business enterprise.
