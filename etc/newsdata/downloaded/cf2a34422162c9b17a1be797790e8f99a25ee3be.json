But we won\u2019t create true justice by cleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.\u201d\n\nThe document borrows heavily from the plan laid out by former climate candidate Jay Inslee, who quit the Democratic presidential primary in August to run for reelection as Washington\u2019s governor, including efforts to quantify pollution inequity between communities and apply that data to decisions on where to invest Green New Deal money. Warren also proposes turning the White House Council on Environmental Quality, a currently sleepy office tasked with coordinating public health policy across federal agencies, into an environmental justice hub.\n\nThe Warren plan offers fewer wonky details on which agencies should do what work than the Inslee proposal did. But notably included in the senator\u2019s release are calls to increase research funding at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to overhaul drinking water infrastructure, putting an end to the privatization of water delivery.\n\nUnder her administration, Warren would \u201cfully fund\u201d the CDC\u2019s \u201cenvironmental health programs, such as childhood lead poisoning prevention, and community health investigations\u201d and would \u201cprovide additional grant funding for independent research into environmental health effects.\u201d Her campaign declined to share an exact dollar figure.\n\nERIC THAYER / Reuters Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for increased funding for research into the health effects of pollution by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively novel idea to include the CDC in a campaign climate plan, something the other leading environmental champions in the race have omitted so far. Yet it\u2019s likely to be popular. In February, representatives from four dozen public health groups sent a letter to House lawmakers pleading for an increase in federal funding for the CDC\u2019s \u201ccritically underfunded\u201d lead and climate programs. The CDC is the fourth-most favorably viewed federal agency and has some of the most bipartisan support, a Pew Research Center poll found in September. Yet the CDC\u2019s operating budget fell nearly $1 million between the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years.\n\nWarren\u2019s plan goes beyond just researching the effects of lead poisoning. Citing the recent lead contaminations in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, and Newark, New Jersey, she said her administration would \u201cend decades of disinvestment and privatization of our nation\u2019s water system \u2015 our government at every level should invest in safe, affordable drinking water for all of us.\u201d\n\nRamping up federal spending on water infrastructure is a staple of Democratic campaigns at this point, particularly as Newark\u2019s former mayor, now-Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), is running for the presidential nomination. But curtailing the transfer of control of public services from government agencies to private companies is another issue altogether.\n\nThe Green New Deal commits us to a \u2018just transition\u2019 for all communities and all workers. But we won\u2019t create true justice by cleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA. Elizabeth Warren\n\nThe private water industry serves 73 million Americans, according to National Association of Water Companies data. For-profit water services put public health at risk, a 66-page paper by University of Louisville law professor Craig Anthony Arnold argues, because the profit motive incentivizes companies to provide better services to customers who pay more and to maintain infrastructure with an eye to the length of the firm\u2019s contract. Detroit\u2019s debt-choked public utility threatened to shut off water to nearly 17,500 households that were behind on bills last year, only to decrease the shutoff rate 70% this year. In the timing of the 2018 shutoffs, just as the city was looking to privatize its utility, the left-wing think tank Centre for Research on Globalization saw an effort to streamline a troubled facility before selling it off to profiteers.\n\nOther cities are actively opposing such privatization. Last November, Baltimore became the first big city in the United States to ban water privatization with an amendment to its charter.\n\nWednesday\u2019s proposal did not make clear whether a Warren White House would take explicit steps to discourage municipalities from switching to private water. But the campaign said an influx of federal funding to overhaul water infrastructure should make switching to private water services far less appealing.\n\nIncome and race are strong indicators of how much pollution exposure Americans can expect to face. Black neighborhoods, on average, have air that\u2019s 48% more polluted than that in white neighborhoods, an NAACP report found last year, and Black Americans are 75% more likely to live in neighborhoods abutting industrial sites. The journal Environmental Research published a study last year that determined Black, Hispanic and poor students face the highest risks of inhaling toxic pollutants in crumbling schools across the country.", "description": "The Democratic presidential hopeful is adopting much of what former candidate Jay Inslee put out.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9d07d42100002a0433efda.jpeg?cache=08rtqiodo6&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
