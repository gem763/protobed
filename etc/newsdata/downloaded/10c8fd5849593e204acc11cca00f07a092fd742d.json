But he knows he\u2019s still got to prove it. He\u2019s still got to make plays to win this game and he did that today.\u201d\n\nBrissett was masterful with the exception of a dropped snap the Texans (4-3) recovered at the Colts 4.\n\nHe finished 26 of 39 with six of the incompletions being throwaways. He had a career best passing total, a career best passer rating (126.7), endured only one sack and had the perfect counterpunch each time Houston fought its way back into contention.\n\nThe Colts (4-2) have now won two straight overall and three straight in the series.\n\n\u201cIt just makes us more balanced and I think that\u2019s what we proved today - that we can throw the ball,\u201d Brissett said. \u201cIt was just a great day for us as a whole.\u201d\n\nAnd it only added to the Texans\u2019 misery.\n\nThey were held to field goals on three red-zone trips in the first half, had to contend with a rare \u201cin the grasp\u201d call that took one touchdown off the board, an overturned replay review that put another one on the board for Indy and a plethora of penalties that Brissett used to his advantage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to answer any officiating questions,\u201d Texans coach Bill O\u2019Brien said twice after Houston was called for 10 penalties.\n\nThen there was the fourth quarter.\n\nHouston (4-3) started it by failing to convert a second fourth-and-1 attempt, and Deshaun Watson threw an interception on the Texans next series before Darius Leonard sealed the win by picking off a tipped ball with 26 seconds left.\n\nWatson was 23 of 34 with 308 yards, one touchdown and was sacked three times as the Texans tried to play catch-up.\n\nBrissett started the opening flurry with an 11-yard TD pass to Zach Pascal . He rebounded from the fumbled snap by connecting with T.Y. Hilton on a nifty 2-yard TD pass to make it 14-6 late in the second quarter.\n\nAfter the Texans made it 14-9, Brissett opened the second half with a 4-yard scoring pass to Eric Ebron, who was originally ruled out of bounds at the end line. But the replay showed he got both feet down to give Indy a 21-9 lead.\n\nHouston cut the deficit to 21-16 on Keke Coutee\u2019s 4-yard scoring run, but Brissett - with the help of three Houston penalties - answered with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Pascal.\n\nWatson made it 28-23 with a 4-yard TD pass to DeAndre Hopkins, but the Texans couldn\u2019t get any closer.\n\n\u201cHe (Brissett) is a very productive player, a very smart player,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe makes good decisions, just a good player.\u201d\n\nSTAT SHEET\n\nTexans: Hopkins had nine catches for 106 yards. Kenny Stills had four catches for 105 yards. \u2026 Carlos Hyde rushed 12 times for 35 yards. \u2026 Houston\u2019s streak of consecutive games without allowing a sack ended at two. \u2026 The Texans have lost only two of their last seven regular-season division games - both to Indy.\n\nColts: Pascal had six receptions for 106 yards and Hilton caught six passes for 74 yards. \u2026 Marlon Mack rushed 18 times for 44 yards. \u2026 Indy has scored at least 23 points in 11 consecutive home games. \u2026 The Colts defense has not allowed a 100-yard runner in 24 straight games.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nTexans: CB Phillip Gaines was carted off the field with what appeared to be a lower leg injury with 1:49 left. \u2026 WR Will Fuller left during Houston\u2019s first series with a hamstring injury and did not return.\n\nColts: DT Carl Davis did not return after injuring his hamstring in the second half.\n\nTHE BASEBALL WORLD\n\nLess than 24 hours after the Houston Astros won the American League title, Texans players were showing their support.\n\nThree-time defensive player of the year J.J. Watt arrived wearing a Jose Altuve shirt and on the field a handful of players continued their traditional pregame ritual of playing baseball with the end zone pylon.\n\n\u201cThey have a chance at a championship and a chance to do something special,\u201d defensive lineman D.J. Reader said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m excited for those guys.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTexans: Return home next Sunday to host Oakland on the final leg of the Raiders extended road trip.\n\nColts: Will host Denver next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Indianapolis Colts kept insisting Jacoby Brissett could win games with his arm.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/aptopix_texans_colts_football_89540_c0-178-4223-2641_s1200x700.jpg?2a1fa53fcf790c891bafc9d5746936fcba5ed0fb", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
