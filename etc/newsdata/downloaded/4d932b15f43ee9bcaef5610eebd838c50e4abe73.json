Feral hogs are thought to be a main reason for its spread, and North Korea has been snubbing the South\u2019s repeated calls for joint quarantine efforts, officials say.\n\nSouth Korea has culled about 154,500 pigs in the past month, all in farms near the North Korean border. North Korea hasn\u2019t released any detailed reports on the disease, but South Korea\u2019s spy agency says that pig herds in one North Korea province were \u201cannihilated.\u201d North Korea observers in Seoul say the pork prices in markets there have soared.\n\nA look at African swine fever in North and South Korea.\n\n__\n\nSTART OF DISEASE\n\nNorth Korea first reported an outbreak in May after widespread deaths of pigs in neighboring China. Chinese officials say farms there have slaughtered at least 1.17 million pigs while trying to control the disease since August 2018.\n\nNorth Korea told the World Organization for Animal Health that 77 of 99 pigs at a farm in its Jagang province, which borders China, died of the disease. The remaining 22 pigs were culled. North Korea said it\u2019s fighting hard to stop the disease\u2019s spread, but has not reported any other outbreaks.\n\nSuh Hoon, director of South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, told lawmakers in a private briefing last month that African swine fever has spread across North Korea. Pig herds in North Pyongan province, north of the capital Pyongyang, have been \u201cannihilated\u201d and people were complaining about the lack of meat, lawmakers said he told them.\n\nNorth Korea monitoring groups say the disease occurred in North Korea well before May.\n\nSouth Korea confirmed its first outbreak in the border town of Paju on Sept. 17. It has since reported 13 more cases near the border and culled 154,500 pigs, including all hogs in Paju.\n\n__\n\nRISKS TO SOUTH KOREA: Failure to contain the disease would be potentially devasting for South Korea\u2019s huge pork industry. The consequences would be much worse for the chronically food-scarce North.\n\nSouth Korean officials say North Korea had about 2.6 million pigs in 14 government-run or cooperative farms before the disease\u2019s outbreak.\n\nCho Chung-hui, a former North Korean official in charge of livestock issues who fled to South Korea in 2011 says pork accounts for up to 80 percent of protein consumption for North Korea\u2019s 25 million people. Many North Korean households raise and sell a pig or two each year to be able to buy rice since rationing systems are in shambles.\n\nA 100 kilogram (220 pound) hog can be sold to buy about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of rice, enough for a family for a year, Cho said.\n\nHe said North Korean animal health officials and farms do not slaughter animals even if they\u2019re sick.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s own risks are somewhat contained by the fact that most of its 6,300 pig farms, raising some 11 million hogs, are indoor facilities. The country has ample experience with fighting animal diseases after dealing with numerous foot-and-mouth outbreaks since the 2000s.\n\n__\n\nWILD BOARS: African swine fever spreads easily through contact with infected animals, carcasses, manure and contaminated substances such as feed, clothing and vehicles.\n\nThe Koreas\u2019 248-kilometer (155-mile) border is the world\u2019s the most heavily fortified with barbed wire fences installed in minefields, but South Korean officials and experts say wild boards could still roam in and out of North Korea by swimming across rivers.\n\nThose rivers could also spread the disease if contaminated by carcasses or runoff from affected farms, says Sur Jung-hyang, a professor of veterinary medicine at Seoul\u2019s Konkuk University.\n\nA powerful typhoon with torrential rains in September likely caused runoff of contaminated soil and water from North Korea in early September, Cho said. Insects and rats could also spread the virus, he said.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Ministry of Environment said that samples taken from seven dead wild boars found on the southern side of the border have tested positive for African swine fever.\n\nWhatever the source of the South Korean outbreaks, experts say controlling movements of wild boars is crucial.\n\n___\n\nQUARANTINE EFFORTS: To stop the disease from spreading, South Korea\u2019s military on Tuesday said it has deployed snipers and civilian hunters to search for and kill wild boars in border areas. They will work in shifts around the clock, using night-vision goggles to spot the animals when it\u2019s dark, which is when they are most active.\n\nThe military will also try flying drones equipped with thermal cameras to monitor areas for wild boars and will use helicopters to transport carcasses and other samples to labs more quickly, the Defense Ministry said.\n\nAuthorities have installed hundreds of traps and plan to install more barbed-wire fences to stop wild boars from reaching pig farms. Thousands have been assigned to enforce quarantines and beef up biosecurity practices at border farms; 2,000 checkpoints have been set up to restrict movements of people and livestock and decontaminate vehicles.\n\nNorth Korea would have much less effective quarantine efforts, the experts said. When he was working in North Korea, Cho said the country did not have any disinfection trucks. It still appears to lack any.\n\n\u201cEven in China, there have been problems about people cooking and eating infected pigs. It would have been the same situation in North Korea,\u201d Sur said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "South Korea is deploying snipers, installing traps and flying drones along its border as it ramps up efforts to stop wild boars from spreading swine fever from rival North Korea.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kim Tong-Hyung", "Hyung-Jin Kim"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/south_korea_koreas_swine_fever_27559_c0-126-4000-2459_s1200x700.jpg?05f575696fc837a855b91b41bf085c558ad5ed50", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
