REUTERS/Beawiharta\n\nThis comes despite expectations of slower growth in the region\u2019s energy demand as economies shift towards less energy-intensive manufacturing and services, and greater efficiency, the agency said in its annual Southeast Asia outlook.\n\nSoutheast Asia was already a net oil importer at 4 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, while strong growth in demand for natural gas has reduced the surplus of gas for export, the world\u2019s energy watchdog said.\n\nFor coal, output from the region\u2019s top producer, Indonesia, remained well above 400 million tonnes of coal equivalent last year but increases in domestic demand and exports to China and India could reduce its surplus, the IEA said.\n\n\u201cThese trends point to Southeast Asia becoming a net importer of fossil fuels in the next few years,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe region\u2019s overall surplus of supply over demand at 120 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) in 2011 had been eroded to just above 30 mtoe in 2018, it said.\n\nGrowing reliance on imports also raises concerns about energy security, the IEA said. For example, the region\u2019s overall dependence on oil imports is forecast to exceed 80% in 2040, up from 65% today.\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s current pathway is heading for rising energy import bills:\n\nhere\n\nWith no change in policy, Southeast Asia\u2019s energy demand is expected to grow by 60% by 2040, accounting for 12% of the rise in global energy use as its economy more than doubles, the IEA said. This was slower than the region\u2019s 80% growth since 2000.\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s growth in electricity demand, at an average of 6% per year, has been among the fastest in the world, the IEA said. Still, some 45 million people there still lack access to electricity. The region is well on the way to achieving universal access to electricity by 2030, it added.\n\nOil demand in Southeast Asia, home to nearly 10% of the world\u2019s population, would surpass 9 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2040, up from just above 6.5 million bpd now, the IEA said.\n\n\u201cOil continues to dominate road transport demand, despite an increase in consumption of biofuels,\u201d the IEA said.\n\n\u201cElectrification of mobility, with the partial exception of two and three wheelers, makes only limited inroads. This pathway suggests little change in Southeast Asia from today\u2019s congested roads and poor urban air quality.\u201d\n\nDemand for coal is also projected to rise steadily over the coming decades, largely fueled by new coal-fired power plants, despite headwinds facing such projects that include increasing difficulty to secure competitive financing for new facilities.\n\nThe IEA said the region\u2019s increasing reliance on imports of natural gas made the fuel less price-competitive though it appeared to be a good fit for the fast-growing cities and lighter industries in the region.\n\n\u201cIn our projections, it is industrial consumers rather than power plants that are the largest source of growth in gas demand,\u201d the IEA added.\n\nRenewable energy is set to play a larger role, but without stronger policy frameworks the share of renewables in power generation would rise only to 30% by 2040, from the current 24%, the IEA said.\n\nWind and solar energy are expected to grow rapidly, while hydropower and modern bioenergy \u2013 including biofuels, biomass, biogas and bioenergy derived from other waste products \u2013 would remain the mainstays of Southeast Asia\u2019s renewables portfolio.\n\nPrimary energy demand in Southeast Asia: here", "description": "Southeast Asia could become a net importer of fossil fuels in the next few years, raising the financial burden on governments and increasing carbon emissions in the region, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in a report.", "authors": ["Koustav Samanta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446346619&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T004", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
