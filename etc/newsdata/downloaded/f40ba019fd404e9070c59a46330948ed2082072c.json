It's fair to say I don't know what would top this.\"\n\nMeanwhile England try-scorer Manu Tuilagi acknowledged the work of Underhill and his fellow forwards by saluting the \"big boys up front\".\n\nThere were fewer than two minutes on the clock when Tuilagi surged over from a close-range ruck to cap a brilliant team move.\n\nBut it was the pack who made sure England achieved just their eighth win in 42 tests against New Zealand and a first since 2012, when Tuilagi scored another fine try in a 38-21 success at Twickenham.\n\n\"We had to come out and play,\" said the powerhouse center of a win that sent 2003 champions England into their fourth World Cup final.\n\n\"Fair play to our big boys they fronted up and did all the hard work for us.\"\n\nEngland led 10-0 at half-time after fly-half George Ford added to Tuilagi's converted try by kicking the first of his four penalty goals.\n\nBut England had been 15-0 ahead before losing 16-15 to New Zealand at Twickenham in November last year.\n\n\"Against the All Blacks, it's never done until the final whistle,\" said Tuilagi. \"We knew that going into half-time our 10-point lead wasn't enough.\"\n\nEngland's determination was evident even before the kick-off when they confronted the All Blacks' traditional pre-match Haka by forming an inverted V.\n\n\"We wanted to show that we're ready, that we're together and that we're ready for anything,\" said Samoa-born Tuilagi while acknowledging the \"honor\" of standing in front of the haka.\n\n\"It was just something different. I think it came from Eddie. I don't think it's the reason we won but it was to show that we accept the challenge.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Sam Underhill said he was having the \"best experience of my life, never mind rugby\" as England booked their place in the World Cup final by dethroning reigning champions New Zealand.
