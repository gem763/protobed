(Photo: T-Mobile)\n\nT-Mobile is recognizing firefighters, local police, and EMS responders by offering the same steep discounts it affords military veterans. On Monday, the wireless carrier announced a rate plan dubbed Magenta First Responder, with 50% off family lines.\n\nThat\u2019s the lowest plan T-Mobile offers any of its customers, and it matches the Magenta Military plan launched in April 2018 that extends to active members of the armed forces and their families.\n\nA family of four pays $100 per month with AutoPay under the new plan, a sum that includes taxes and fees. A standard Netflix subscription is also included, as are such benefits as unlimited texting and data and an unlimited hotspot with up to 3 gigabytes of high-speed data. A single line goes for $55 per month; two lines $40 each and three lines, $30 each.\n\nCustomers who pay $35 for a single line up to $140 for four for a \u201cPlus\u201d version of the plan receive other benefits, including high-definition streaming (as opposed to standard definition) and 20GB of speedy hotspot data.\n\nThe plans kick in on Nov. 1 and apply to eligible state and local law enforcement, firefighters, emergency response personnel, pensioned retirees, as well as parents, children, or spouses of first responders killed in the line of duty.\n\nThe first responder must be the account holder and maintain a valid first responder line. Federal employees are not eligible.\n\nFor a limited time, customers can also get half off the latest Samsung smartphones, including the Note 10 and Note 10+. (If you can cancel before receiving 24 bill credits, you\u2019ll owe the balance on the phones.)\n\nT-Mobile also says that first responders who own small businesses can extend discounts to their companies, with 50% off employee lines up to six lines.\n\nApple TV+ preview: Apple TV Plus launching Friday with lowest price for major subscription service\n\nIn a statement, T-Mobile CEO John Legere said that \u201cAt T-Mobile, we\u2019re on an unrelenting mission to change wireless for good. With Magenta First Responder, we\u2019ll put money right back in the pockets of our nation\u2019s first responders and their families.\u201d\n\nLegere added that the company\u2019s military plan forced AT&T and Verizon to respond, leading to collective savings for such families estimated at more than $1 billion a year.\n\nFor its part, Verizon faced heavy criticism last year when it accidentally throttled or slowed down data during wildfires in California. Verizon subsequently honored California firefighters in ads that ran during the Super Bowl.\n\nVerizon, AT&T and (pending regulatory approval) T-Mobile's merger partner Sprint offer their own more modest first responder discounts to customers on select plans and accessories.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/10/28/tmobile-offers-discounts-for-firefighters-ems-police/2484026001/", "description": "Under its Magenta First Responder plan, eligible T-Mobile customers pay $100 per month for a family plan.
