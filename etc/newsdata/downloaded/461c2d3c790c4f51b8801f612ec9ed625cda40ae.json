Everyone needs help in football. You can\u2019t play alone. Manchester United is an amazing club with an amazing story and for people around the world, it\u2019s difficult to understand what has happened to this club.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s difficult to see this club in difficulty, but if this difficulty is arriving it\u2019s because you have one problem. In my opinion the problem is sensibility. It\u2019s important to work together, sporting with economy. If you don\u2019t put these things together I believe you are heading for disaster!\n\n\u2018I know very well the situation of Manchester United and other clubs \u2013 but, in my opinion, everybody needs a sporting director because the coach needs time to prepare for the next match and the super ego of the players too, so he needs people with sensibility. If a coach is alone it\u2019s more difficult now.\n\n\u2018A sporting director is very, very important. Of course I believe I could help Manchester United, but I respect the politics of the club. It\u2019s very prestigious, very, very prestigious, but in modern football you need a sporting director. If you have a sporting director you have this sensibility.\n\nCampos believes Woodward needs someone to help with the sporting side (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Before, the coach did everything, but now the information is arriving very fast. Now the world is very different. You need to know players in every part of the world. It\u2019s important the club has one project and with a sporting director everyone understands where they go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You need one person with the sensibility for the sporting and economic situation. In modern football you need both to work together. If they don\u2019t work together you have a disaster.\u2019\n\nOn whether he might be tempted by a club like United, he added: \u2018Of course I want to work with a big club one day. But the Lille project gives me big pleasure because when I arrived we were in difficulty. I am happy here \u2013 so only a special situation will make me change a project.\u2019", "description": "Lille transfer guru Luis Campos has urged Manchester United to finally appoint a sporting director to offer more support to the manager and has hinted he would be willing to...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-999282716_1570564754.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
