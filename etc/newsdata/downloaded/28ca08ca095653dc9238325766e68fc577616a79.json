The US state doles them out to civilians they deem especially meritorious, and notable Kentucky Colonels include Princess Kate, Jennifer Lawrence, and Betty White.\n\nOnly one Kentucky Colonel is the subject of a new dating sim, though \u2013 and it\u2019s not one of the Golden Girls.\n\nThat\u2019s right, gamers. It\u2019s time to fuck the chicken man.\n\nGame Informer reports I Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin\u2019 Good Dating Simulator will appear on Steam later this month, giving players the opportunity to woo a zaddified version of the late fast food mogul.\n\nThe game puts players in the position of a young culinary student, hungry (and thirsty) for knowledge and the Colonel\u2019s secret herbs and spices. Here\u2019s how developers Psyop put it:\n\nDo you have what it takes to survive culinary school? Will Colonel Sanders choose you to be his business partner? Or maybe even so much more?\n\nYummy yummy.\n\nA trailer features Harland himself, along with stand-ins for KFC competitors and the noble Professor Dog.\n\nWhile I am loathe to entertain marketing tie-ins, the fact Kuffa is leaning into this kind of bullshit is noteworthy. It\u2019s more palatable than some of their other efforts, at least.\n\nIn the meantime, we\u2019re hoping a game where you seduce Colonel Billy Ray Cyrus is next up. Yes, he\u2019s also a Kentucky Colonel. Check for yourself.\n\nREAD MORE Chuck Some Red Shells At Yr Responsibilities 'Coz Mario Kart Tour Is Out Next Month", "description": "'I Love You, Colonel Sanders!
