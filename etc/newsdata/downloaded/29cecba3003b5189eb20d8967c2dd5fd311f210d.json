Disley, OBE, CEO, Mogrify has developed a proprietary direct cellular conversion technology, which makes it possible to transform (transmogrify) any mature human cell type into any other without going through a pluripotent stem cell- or progenitor cell-state.\n\nThe company is deploying this platform to develop novel cell therapies addressing musculoskeletal, auto-immune, cancer immunotherapy, ocular and respiratory diseases as well as generating a broad IP position relating to cell conversions that exhibit safety, efficacy and scalable manufacturing profiles suitable for development as cell therapies.\n\nMogrify is commercializing its technology platform via a model that includes development and out-license of internally developed cell therapy assets, development and license of novel cell conversion IP, and the formation of joint-ventures to exploit the platform and/or novel cell conversion IP in non-core areas.\n\nAlice Newcombe-Ellis, Founder and Managing Partner of Ahren, and Alastair Kilgour, Chief Investment Officer, Parkwalk, both join Mogrify\u2019s board of directors along with Dr. Karin Schmitt, the company\u2019s Chief Business Officer.\n\nFinSMEs\n\n14/10/2019", "description": "Mogrify Ltd, a Cambridge, UK-based company advancing life-saving cell therapies, held the initial close of its Series A funding raising $16m", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.finsmes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mogrify.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
