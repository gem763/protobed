The functionality is powered by Project Soli, a radar-based technology developed by Google. Google advertises that the Pixel 4 is the \u201cfirst smartphone with a radar sensor\u201d and claims that it has the \u201cfastest secure face unlock on a smartphone.\u201d\n\nGoogle took the unusual step of announcing gesture support on the Pixel 4 months ahead of the phone\u2019s official launch. At the time, the company showed how it could be used to skip music tracks without having to touch your phone screen, and added in a blog post that it could also snooze alarms and silence phone calls. However, in the time since then, a flood of leaks has revealed more functionality, most notably a Pok\u00e9mon demo that sees you interact with a virtual creature using gestures.\n\nMotion Sense helps you get things done on your #pixel4 without touching it. Swipe to skip a song, silence a call with a flick of your hand, and unlock your phone super fast with face unlock. #madebygoogle pic.twitter.com/HAIBtBUsxE \u2014 Google (@Google) October 15, 2019\n\nProject Soli is the work of Google\u2019s Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) team, which has been working on the technology for the past five years. Originally created for use in smartwatches and smart speakers, the feature will now make its debut with the Pixel 4, a smartphone. We were first given a demonstration of the technology way back in 2016 when we saw a smartwatch use it to recognize small hand gestures to cycle through its menus.\n\nHowever, Soli\u2019s reliance on radar technology means that it needs approval to operate in each country the Pixel 4 launches in. The FCC gave its approval for Google to use the technology in the US at the end of last year, but an earlier rumor suggested the functionality won\u2019t be available on the phone when it launches in other countries including Japan, Mexico, India, Australia, and New Zealand. Google has yet to offer official confirmation of this, but its original Motion Sense announcement video cautioned that the feature \u201cmay not be available in all Pixel countries.\u201d\n\nDeveloping.
