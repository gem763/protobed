And it's just not really the kind of trauma that goes away,\" Sanchez's lawyer Mari Newman told As It Happens host Carol Off.\n\n\"What should have been the happiest moment of her life ended up being something that was an absolute horror for her.\"\n\nWarning: The following video clip contains disturbing footage:\n\nSurveillance video released by her lawyer shows Diana Sanchez crying out in pain while delivering a baby boy in a Denver County Jail medical cell on July 31, 2018. (Submitted by Killmer, Lane & Newman, LLP law firm) 3:10\n\nNewman says staff at the Denver County Jail knew Sanchez was eight months' pregnant when she first arrived to serve time for violating her probation on identity theft charges, which she sustained for cashing a cheque addressed to her sister.\n\nNobody called an ambulance\n\nWhen she went into labour on July 31, 2018, she was in a medical cell awaiting transportation to hospital. Staff requested a correctional van to pick her up \u2014 not an ambulance.\n\nBut the jail workers knew the ride likely wouldn't be available for hours until the morning booking process was finished, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nTheir failure to provide medical care for Ms. Sanchez and her baby is really unforgivable. - Mari Newman, lawyer\n\n\"Immediately upon Ms. Sanchez informing the staff that she had been having contractions, she should have been taken to a hospital. There's no reason not to have done so,\" Newman said.\n\n\"But instead, what happened is she ended up at some point realizing nobody was going to help her. And she ultimately ended up pulling down her pants and laying down on the hard bench and giving birth all by herself just feet away from a dirty toilet. It's really disgusting.\"\n\nIn the jail cell footage, correctional officials have blocked out the toilet with a black bar.\n\nNew policies in place\n\nThe jail's nurses are hired from Denver Health, the city's public hospital, and the Denver County Sheriff's Department said Sanchez was in a medical unit under the care of nurses at the time she delivered.\n\nDenver Health declined to comment on a pending lawsuit but defended its work in the jail.\n\n\"Denver Health provides high quality medical care to thousands of inmates every year,\" spokesman Simon Crittle said.\n\nThe sheriff's department said that it has since changed its policy to ensure that pregnant inmates who are in any stage of labour are immediately taken to hospital.\n\nPreviously, such decisions were left to jail nurses, but deputies are now authorized to call for an ambulance for someone in labour, department spokeswoman Daria Serna said.\n\nNewman says it's absurd this wasn't already jail policy.\n\n\"I'm simply flabbergasted by the notion that Denver says that when a woman gives birth all by herself with no medical care whatsoever in a dirty jail cell, they've done nothing wrong,\" she said.\n\n\"If that's what happens when they do nothing wrong, I shudder to think what it looks like when they do make a mistake.\"\n\nAfter she gave birth, a nurse walked in and picked up the baby boy. But the lawsuit says nobody dried or warmed the baby or cleared mucus from his mouth for several minutes, and that jail nurses did not have equipment to cut the baby's umbilical cord.\n\n\"[The nurse] looked at the baby like it was a surprise that the baby was there,\" Newman said. \"Obviously, it was the only possible outcome when a woman is in labour that there will ultimately be a baby.\"\n\nBaby is doing fine\n\nSanchez was not available for comment. Last year, she told Denver KDVR-TV, which first reported on the delivery, that the jail treats inmates like \"garbage.\"\n\n\"I know I was there because I was at fault for that I did wrong \u2014 and I didn't deserve that and especially, not my baby,\" she said.\n\nSanchez's son is healthy, Newman said \u2014 but his mother continues to suffer from the trauma.\n\n\"This time it happens that Denver and Denver Health didn't kill anybody. But because they happened to get lucky and nobody died hardly means that they didn't do anything wrong,\" she said.\n\n\"Their failure to provide medical care for Ms. Sanchez and her baby is really unforgivable. It's an obvious constitutional violation, but it's also a surprising failure just to treat a human being with the kind of humanity that we would expect from anybody.\"\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press.
