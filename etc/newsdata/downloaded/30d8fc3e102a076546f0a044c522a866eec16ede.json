This is The Trailer.\n\nJoe Biden speaks with Elizabeth Warren during Thursday's debate. (Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 The longest Democratic primary debate so far was, in some ways, the friendliest. The \u201cshowdown\u201d between Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a big focus of plenty of pre-debate speculation, didn't really happen. The party's leftward march on energy policy, which Republicans hoped would become Thursday night's flash point, went undiscussed. And after the roughest exchange of the night \u2014 former HUD secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro accusing Biden of forgetting his own health-care plan \u2014 Democratic pundits rapped Castro on the knuckles for sounding too mean.\n\nThe result of all this was a night that captured how the top Democratic contenders carry themselves on the campaign trail, with Biden promising to continue President Barack Obama's legacy and the rest of the candidates pitching themselves as personable, electable and passionate.\n\nBest first 20 minutes: Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. On the stump, Biden often starts slow \u2014 a joke, or a grim recollection of personal loss \u2014 and speeds up. His opening statement was a version of how he often closes, an on-your-feet celebration of American optimism.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a single solitary time when we\u2019ve set our mind to something we\u2019ve been unable to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re walking around with our heads down like woe is me.\u201d\n\nBiden also got a gift when ABC News's George Stephanopoulos adopted his framing of the health insurance debate: \u201cYou want to build on Obamacare, not scrap it.\u201d From that point, Biden tapped into Democratic nervousness about how Republicans would run against Medicare-for-all, at one point even responding to Sen. Bernie Sanders's point that America was \u201cspending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians\u201d by saying, \u201cThis is America.\u201d\n\nOn a replay, Biden's description of the problems with Medicare-for-all didn't always make sense. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost you in your pay \u2014 there will be a deductible, in your paycheck,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to \u2014 the middle-class person, someone making 60 grand with three kids, they\u2019re going to end up paying $5,000 more. They\u2019re going to end up paying 4 percent more on their income tax.\u201d (If implemented as is, the Sanders bill would raise taxes while eliminating premiums and insurance costs.)\n\nBut debate analysis tends to roll in waves. Biden did what he came to do: attack Medicare-for-all and insist that its supporters wanted to undermine the Obama legacy for no political upside. Warren and Sanders were comfortable pushing back, but Warren did more to rebut Biden's most effective line.\n\n\u201cWe all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed health care in America and committed this country to health care for every human being,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now the question is, how best can we improve on it?\u201d\n\nWorst two minutes: Joe Biden. In previous debates, and some speeches, the former vice president stops himself before an answer gets unwieldy; 90 seconds into a riff, he'll deliver a quick \u201canyway\u201d and change topics. The looser debate format Thursday night (partly due to the network, partly to candidates running over their time) resulted in the night's most confusing answer, to a question ostensibly about reparations for black Americans, which Biden took as a cue to discuss education spending and desegregation.\n\n\u201cWe bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt's not want they don't want to help. They don't \u2014 they don't know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2014 the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\u201d\n\nAnother \u201cwave\u201d of debate analysis is the morning-after assessment; the debate is out of the candidates' hands, and largely out of surrogates' hands, as readers and watchers share videos or favorite moments. Biden's rambling answer has already inspired more confusion than anything he said in the first two debates. If the clip of that answer is widely shared, it's good for the candidates trying (and pleading) to get moderate voters thinking about their non-Biden options.\n\nBiggest missed opportunities: Bernie Sanders. Twice, the senator from Vermont zeroed in on weaknesses in Biden's record for today's Democratic voters: his support of NAFTA and his vote for the Iraq War. Both times, Sanders made the attack, then switched to discuss his own policies. And thanks to the debate's format, that let Biden walk away from the attack. On NAFTA, Biden gave a mainstream Democratic answer (\u201cIf we don't set the rules, we, in fact, are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules\") and wasn't pressured to expand on it. On Iraq, Sanders went directly at Biden: \"One of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq.\" But he turned the answer back to his work for veterans, allowing moderators to keep moving and bring Andrew Yang into the discussion.\n\nSanders also held back on one of the issues many of his supporters want to use against Warren: her votes for the first two National Defense Authorization Acts of the Trump presidency. \u201cI am the only person up here to have voted against all three of President Trump's military budgets,\u201d Sanders said, to applause. Then he kept talking, leaving it to viewers at home to puzzle out that Sens. Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar had voted with Trump.\n\n\u201cDebates have a certain flow,\u201d Sanders strategist Jeff Weaver said after the debate. \u201cYou can ask questions at a certain time and you make your points when you see the openings. I think job number one was to contrast with Vice President Biden on a number of issues.\u201d Sanders's supporters, especially online, are very game to attack Warren; Sanders still isn't.\n\nBiggest risk: Juli\u00e1n Castro. Biden's resilience in the polls has made his campaign more and more confident about his brand. Two candidates who previously used time onstage to attack him then dropped out: Rep. Eric Swalwell of California and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. Harris boosted her campaign by criticizing Biden on busing; Biden's campaign pushed back, pointing out that she did not have a fundamental policy disagreement, and Harris lost some of her new support. Biden's reservoir of goodwill is deep, and no one has figured out a way to raise doubts about how he'd fare in a long election without being accused of \"cheap shots.\"\n\nEnter Castro, who has now used every debate to contrast himself with more popular candidates: first Beto O'Rourke on immigration, then Biden on immigration, then, last night, Biden on health care. In addition to accusing Biden of forgetting his own plan, he was the only candidate to say explicitly that Biden's plans were not bold enough to live up to the Obama legacy: \"Barack Obama's vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.\"\n\nBest joke: Cory Booker and Andrew Yang. Booker's campaign has embraced the candidate's \u201cdad joke\u201d sensibilities, and he delivered on them after getting a question about whether he would encourage more voters to become vegan. \u201cFirst of all, I want to say no,\u201d he said. \u201cActually, I want to translate that into Spanish: No.\u201d Yang, who often jokes that he's the opposite of Trump \u2014 \"an Asian man who loves math\" \u2014 went to the same well for his biggest laugh line. \"I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork.\"\n\nBest closing statement: Beto O'Rourke. Instead of asking candidates for generic closing statements, ABC News asked the candidates about the \u201cmost significant professional setback you've had to face.\u201d Biden, who had to restart his answer after protesters interrupted him, has the most heartbreaking story of any candidate about his personal setbacks, but had to cram it into a statement about \u201cfinding purpose.\u201d Warren shortened the story she shares at town halls, about losing a job because she was pregnant, then restarting her life with a law degree. Sanders described his initial electoral losses and how he went on to battle \u201cvirtually every powerful special interest in this country.\u201d\n\nO'Rourke, who has emerged as the on-the-ground feel-your-pain candidate, did the most to portray how it would work in a general election. His close was all about the shooting in El Paso: \u201cIn the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community, in large part by the president of the United States, that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that, nor were we defined by that,\u201d he said. (O'Rourke's strongest moment up to then was declaring that \"hell yes,\" AR-15 gun owners would have to sell their weapons to the government, a study of how he channels voter angst and anger into his own positions.) There's no great way to answer the \u201csetback\u201d question, so O'Rourke made it about other people.\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\u201cDemocrats argue over health care and other core issues \u2014 and the direction of the party,\u201d by Felicia Sonmez, Cleve R.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York burning up and revealing a pile of skulls. \u201cDoes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez know the horrors of socialism?\u201d Heng asks, drawing a line from the Cambodian genocide to the rise of Democratic Socialists of America. \u201cMine is a face of freedom.\u201d\n\nHeng, 34, worked on Capitol Hill then made a 2018 run for California's 16th District against Rep. Jim Costa. In the 2014 midterm, when Democratic turnout in Latino areas plunged, Costa won a two-point squeaker, putting the central California district on the GOP's map. But four years later, Heng raised $1.3 million to Costa's $1.8 million and got crushed: She won just 42.5 percent of the vote. That was stronger than Donald Trump's performance in the district, but it was ominous for 2020, when a presidential election is likely to spike Democratic turnout again. Heng could file to run again as late as Dec. 6; the new PAC is going to get more attention than a second run would.\n\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox three times a week.

That's normal; in 2016, more than 2 percent of Texas's GOP primary votes ended up with candidates who, by primary day, had quit the race. It's also far from clear who would benefit in Texas if the race was whittled down to a few candidates. Warren, here as in many states, is the most popular \u201csecond choice\u201d candidate. Latino voters are all over the map, with 25 percent backing Biden, 19 percent backing Warren, 19 percent backing O'Rourke and 14 percent backing Sanders. The senator from Vermont often does far better with Latinos, partially because of the long primary campaign he ran in California; he barely campaigned in Texas in 2016.\n\nDo you support or oppose a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons? (Quinnipiac, 1,410 registered Texas voters)\n\nSupport \u2014 50%\n\nOppose \u2014 43%\n\nSix years ago, when the Democratic-run Senate held votes on gun-control bills, their strongest proposal was universal background checks \u2014 but it didn't get every Democrat. The assault weapons ban, resurrected by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, did even worse, losing 15 Democratic votes. At the time, Democrats in red and swing states remained terrified of what could happen if they were characterized as \"gun grabbers.\u201d But this is the latest of several polls to find the assault weapons ban picking up support from non-Democrats; 29 percent of Republicans and 30 percent of white men favor the idea.\n\nWAIT, WHAT?\n\nAndrew Yang speaks during the Thursday debate. (David J. Phillip/AP)\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 In July, Andrew Yang announced that he would demonstrate the power of his proposed \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d \u2014 a $1,000 monthly check from the government \u2014 by giving that $1,000 to an Iowa family. No complaints were filed; no lawyers went after him for what could be construed as a voter bribe. It wasn't a surprise when Yang expanded on the idea at Thursday's debate: free checks for a year to 10 American families.\n\n\u201cIf you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to yang2020.com and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe laughter at Yang's idea, especially from Sen. Kamala Harris, paused the debate for a few seconds. Why had no Democrat pitched this before? The main reason was that they, and most campaigns, believed that distributing money this way was illegal; campaign money cannot be donated to individuals.\n\n\u201cWe have some very, very smart advisers and lawyers and we're very very confident that this is 100 percent legal,\u201d Yang said in a short interview after the debate. \u201cBut I do want to call out just the ridiculousness of our process, where everyone thinks it's totally fine for a billionaire to spend $10 million-plus essentially buying his way on the debate stage. It's like: Oh, that's fine, but then a campaign literally giving money to American citizens to do whatever they want? That is problematic! Think about how bizarre a world where you are and where you actually have to ask that kind of question.\"\n\nYang's jab at an unnamed \"billionaire\" was clearly about Tom Steyer, the mega-donor who has qualified for the October debates by spending more than $10 million on advertising, boosting his name ID and attracting more than 130,000 small donors.\n\nOne advantage for Yang is that it's unclear who has the authority to punish him. The Federal Election Commission is essentially defunct; Republicans declined to appoint new members to the commission, which means it lacks a quorum and can't make decisions at all.\n\nCOUNTDOWN\n\n... three days until the Galivants stump in South Carolina\n\n... four days until the Philadelphia AFL-CIO's candidate summit in Philadelphia\n\n... eight days until the Polk County Democrats' steak fry\n\n... 18 days until the cutoff for the fourth Democratic primary debate in Ohio", "description": "", "authors": ["David Weigel", "National Reporter Covering Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/62332a06d0e1647b75363d31e52632f0-3500-2134-70-8-20190913T023541Z_1350726212_HP1EF9D077H5R_RTRMADP_5_USAELECTIONDEBATE_tstmp_1568393216.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
