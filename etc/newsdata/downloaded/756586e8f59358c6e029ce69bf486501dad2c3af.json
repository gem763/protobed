No hangovers.'\n\nJessica may have taken some inspiration from her the Duchess of Sussex's new life as a royal when she pointed out that high tea is another great option for brides.\n\n'I think this is the most elegant way to do a bachelorette party,' she said. 'Sometimes brides, they want to include everyone that's special in lives.\n\n'They want to include grandma.
