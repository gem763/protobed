REUTERS/Matthew Tostevin\n\nThe term is used by ardent supporters of the monarchy and military to label anyone they see as a threat in a kingdom where polarisation between the ruling establishment and Thais seeking change has become even sharper after the end of junta rule this year.\n\n\u201cChung-Chart\u201d is now a stock phrase for pro-government media and politicians as well as conservative nationalists waging an increasing battle against the opposition on social media and in the courts, illustrating the deepening political divide in the southeast Asian nation.\n\nAlthough it echoes a global rise in nationalism from the United States to China to India to Europe, Thailand\u2019s brand is rooted in royalty, the barracks and the \u201cyellow\u201d camp which for decades has been at odds with ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra\u2019s \u201cred\u201d supporters.\n\nThe term \u201cChung-Chart\u201d was first popularised by Warong Dechgitvigrom, a senior figure in the Democrat Party, the old establishment party which floundered in the March election.\n\n\u201cI see this as liberalism that destroys traditions and the monarchy by claiming to be democratic,\u201d Warong told Reuters. \u201cWe need to fight them through ideology. The New Right is a political ideology.\u201d\n\nThe groups and individuals who say they are acting in the name of the palace and the army also say they get no direct support from those institutions. Government spokeswoman Narumon Pinyosinwat declined comment on the issue and said Thailand is a free country.\n\n\u201cThe military is not behind any groups,\u201d said defence ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantravanich. \u201cThe military does not support anyone engaged in activism outside parliament.\u201d\n\nA palace official declined comment.\n\nALIGNED\n\nBut the strident nationalists\u2019 messages are very much aligned with those of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former junta leader, and army chief Apirat Kongsompong, who has described Thailand as being in a \u201chybrid war\u201d against enemies of tradition.\n\nAt the March election, held under rules widely seen as favouring establishment parties, 40-year-old tycoon Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit\u2019s new Future Forward party made significant gains with pledges to change the army-drafted constitution, end conscription and cut army budgets.\n\nParties backing Prayuth only just edged out an alliance uniting Future Forward with the main party linked to Thaksin.\n\n\u201cWe have disrupted their equation, which has now made us a target,\u201d said Future Forward spokeswoman Pannika Wanich, referring to the former junta figures and their supporters who held on to power.\n\n\u201cBeyond using legal mechanisms that the state possesses to undermine us, they are also trying to undermine our popularity and credibility on social media.\u201d\n\nThe election aftermath has been characterised by increasing vitriol in parliament and on social media.\n\n\u201cThe two sides are becoming more entrenched,\u201d said Kasit Piromya, once seen as a firebrand leader of the establishment yellow shirts, but who quit the Democrat Party after its decision to back Prayuth. \u201cI think the trains are colliding.\u201d\n\n\u201cPSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE\u201d\n\nUse of social media targeting youths was widely credited as helping Future Forward: The party has over 800,000 followers on Facebook compared to fewer than 142,000 for the pro-military Palang Pracharat party.\n\nAlthough Future Forward\u2019s own posts are focused on policy issues, supporters frequently mock Prayuth and other leaders with memes that paint them as out of touch.\n\n\u201cThey want to destroy the Thai system and change it to the Marxist-Socialist system of the \u2018Chung-Chart\u2019 gang,\u201d said \u201cTop Secret Thai,\u201d a Facebook page with almost 500,000 followers, referring to liberals.\n\nMany in the new right accuse their opponents of seeking to end the monarchy - a position which would be illegal in Thailand and which opposition politicians have repeatedly denied.\n\nFor the right-wingers, social media can also be a source of ammunition for legal battles.\n\nSongklod \u201cPukem\u201d Chuenchoopol, 54, a retired army captain and founder of the right-wing \u201cThai Wisdom Guard\u201d spends most of his day trawling for evidence to file a case under the strict computer crimes act or other laws.\n\n\u201cThis is psychological warfare,\u201d said Songklod, describing a recent case he brought against over 100 people for sharing a post he deemed critical of the Constitutional Court.\n\nLegal complaints have also been brought by members of Prayuth\u2019s Palang Pracharat party in a system where police generally investigate all such cases.\n\nThanathorn and senior party members face at least 22 cases brought by individuals. One case, over which he could be banned from politics, is about Thanathorn\u2019s alleged ownership of shares in a media company at the start of the election campaign.\n\nSome of the opposition politicians targeted have launched their own legal counter moves against their opponents.\n\nCONFRONTATION\n\nThe right-wing leaders all say they reject violence, but opposition figures and activists accuse them of at least encouraging an atmosphere of confrontation.\n\nOpposition activist Sirawith \u201cJa New\u201d Seritiwat, 27, was attacked just outside his home in June by people in motorcycle helmets. He was left barely conscious and was rushed to intensive care.\n\nThere was no claim of responsibility for the attack, one of seven on activists since the March 24 election.\n\nSince December, at least six exiled Thai activists who lived in neighbouring Laos have disappeared. All of those who disappeared had spoken out against the military and the monarchy.\n\nThailand\u2019s government has said it has no knowledge of any of the disappearances of dissidents abroad.\n\n\u201cI think hatred has become more intense and the elite has stirred up more hatred,\u201d Sirawith told Reuters. \u201cThose that disagree become the enemy of the state and are accused of wanting to topple the monarchy even though they do not.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nMany right-wing leaders - and the army chief - say they suspect attacks such as the one on Sirawith are \u201cset-ups\u201d designed to benefit the opposition. Among the nationalist supporters on social media, the mood is harsher:\n\n\u201cLet him bleed for four to five days, just for fun,\u201d wrote one Facebook commentator of the attack on Sirawith.\n\nAnother wrote: \u201cWhat a shame, it should have been harder.\u201d", "description": "A new term is gaining ground in Thailand's political vocabulary: \"Chung-Chart\", which translates roughly as \"nation-hater\".", "authors": ["Panu Wongcha-Um", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426427210&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840ES", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
