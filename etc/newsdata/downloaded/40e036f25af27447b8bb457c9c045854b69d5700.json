That is expected to be confirmed by Thursday\u2019s third-quarter GDP data.\n\nThe protests, which started over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades and also pose the biggest populist challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.", "description": "Hong Kong is bracing for a rowdy and possibly hugely dangerous Halloween on Thursday, when thousands of pro-democracy protesters, many wearing banned face masks, plan to combine with fancy-dress clubbers in the party district of Lan Kwai Fong.", "authors": ["Farah Master", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446463443&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0J2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
