It stands, sturdy and square, at the heart of a gold-rush boomtown in northwest British Columbia, a monument to careful branding. The windows of the Arctic Restaurant have no signs offering access to prostitutes\u2014even in a lawless Yukon outpost in 1899, decorum rules out such truth in advertising\u2014but Friedrich Trump knows his clientele. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. Curtained-off \u201cprivate boxes\u201d line the wall opposite the bar, inside of which are beds, and women, and scales to weigh gold powder, the preferred method of payment for services rendered. Word of the restaurant\u2019s off-menu accommodations spreads fast. \u201cRespectable women\u201d are advised by The Yukon Sun to avoid the place, as they are \u201cliable to hear that which would be repugnant to their feelings.\u201d But among lonely prospectors, the Arctic is a hit. Before long, Friedrich is boasting, with a hereditary penchant for hyperbole, that his establishment serves more than 3,000 meals a day.\n\nIt\u2019s true that he has plenty of customers. A hundred thousand men have raced north in search of gold at the twilight of the 19th century, hypnotized by a shimmering mirage that Friedrich himself must have recognized. He was chasing a similar figment when he left his German hometown at 16, crossed the Atlantic in steerage, and disembarked on the shores of Manhattan, poor, dirty, and emanating the signature migrant\u2019s stench\u2014widely known then as \u201cship\u201d\u2014which would cling to him for days no matter how hard he scrubbed. He made a living for a while as a barber, but a living was not what he\u2019d come for. So when he heard about fortunes being made in the Pacific Northwest, he gathered his savings and boarded a train. Friedrich sees that he can get rich in the Klondike not by digging for gold but by servicing the gold rushers themselves. This is its own kind of extractive business\u2014\u201cmining the miners,\u201d his biographer, Gwenda Blair, will later call it\u2014and it requires a distinct skill set. Quiet and wiry, with a handlebar mustache, he bounces from boomtown to boomtown, conning his way onto scraps of land by pretending to find gold there. Once a claim is secured, he hustles to make as much cash as he can before the local bubble bursts and the miners move on. A restaurant in Seattle\u2019s red-light district. A boarding house in Monte Cristo, Washington. A trailside tent hawking horse meat and liquor to the men stampeding up Alaska\u2019s White Pass. Each venture turns a profit, but the brothel is the one that makes him rich enough to return home to Germany and have his pick of pretty, much younger brides.\n\nFriedrich and his wife consider staying in their native country, but he is a draft dodger\u2014or so the government says\u2014and his petition for residency is denied. Indignant, he takes his new family and his new money back to New York City, where he is free to pursue that shape-shifting mirage\u2014is it starting to resemble respectability?\u2014without the weight of a past. By the time the Spanish flu takes him at age 49, he\u2019s amassed a modest fortune\u2014the modern equivalent of half a million dollars\u2014and a small portfolio of outer-borough properties. It isn\u2019t Rockefeller money, but it\u2019s enough, just barely, to launch a dynasty. To keep the family afloat, Friedrich\u2019s widow, Elizabeth, assigns each of her children a job in their fledgling real-estate business. But it\u2019s Fred, the middle child, who has a knack for building, both houses and empires, and he takes charge shortly after high school. Fred runs the enterprise in a clock-racing, corner-cutting scramble, selling each new house to cover construction costs for the last. He backslaps his way through Brooklyn\u2019s political machine, cozies up to mobsters. One house in Woodhaven leads to two in Queens Village, then several more in Hollis. When the federal government starts offering loans to Depression-plagued developers, Fred is first in line\u2014and soon he has an army of shovel-wielding workers digging 450 foundations out of the East Flatbush swampland. As rows of mass-produced \u201cTrump Homes\u201d spread across Brooklyn and Queens, the papers call Fred the Henry Ford of home building. Later, when the scandals start to come out\u2014the charges of profiteering, and fraud, and banning black tenants\u2014the papers find other things to call him. Infamy attends each new triumph. By the 1950s, he has built thousands of houses and apartments, and become the kind of landlord Woody Guthrie writes songs about.\n\nWhen the time comes to plan his own succession, Fred turns first to his eldest son and namesake. But Fred Jr. has no feel for the business\u2014he\u2019s soft and free-spirited, and wants to fly airplanes. Donald is the one with a taste for combat, and to him the great unconquered frontier lies across the East River. Donald sees more than money in Manhattan. He sees fame, status, entr\u00e9e into elite society\u2014things the Trumps have never had. The market on the island is crowded and hostile, but Fred and Donald work closely to plot their invasion. Together, they cook books, fleece investors, and fool one regulator after another. Some of the scion\u2019s schemes pay off. Others prove disastrous. But his signal achievement is forging the Donald Trump persona itself\u2014that high-flying playboy, that self-made man, that larger-than-life titan the tabloids can\u2019t resist. It\u2019s a creation of both father and son, and it will do more for the family business than any casino or skyscraper. Today a photo of Fred sits in the Oval Office, looking out on an empire much vaster and more powerful than even he could have imagined. And while the president writes his chapter in history, the next generation waits in the wings, jockeying for position, feuding over status, knowing only one of them can be the heir.\n\nRyan Melgar\n\nI. They stood shoulder to shoulder\u2014Don Jr., Ivanka, Jared, and Eric\u2014watching the conquest unfold on TV. Ohio was theirs. Then North Carolina and Florida, too. The vaunted midwestern \u201cblue wall\u201d was crumbling on live TV, as ashen-faced pundits muttered about the electoral map. The scene was surreal, and delicious.\n\nWhile Don and Eric fielded congratulatory text messages, some in the room noticed Ivanka cut through the thick scrum of campaign aides and attach herself to her father\u2019s side. \u201cDid you hear that, Dad?\u201d she asked whenever the TV delivered good news, expertly guarding his attention just as she had since she was a young girl. Around midnight, the family realized they would need a victory speech. No one had bothered to write one, because Trump wasn\u2019t supposed to win\u2014at least not electorally. He was supposed to go down in a spectacular blaze of made-for-TV martyrdom that all of them could capitalize on. Ivanka had a book coming out. Don and Eric were working on a line of patriotically themed budget hotels. And preliminary talks were under way to launch a Trump-branded TV network that would turn disgruntled voters into viewers. Now they needed a new plan. One by one, they retreated from the buzzing hive on the 14th floor of Trump Tower and rode the elevator up to their father\u2019s penthouse. Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller\u2014sleep-deprived and pulsing with adrenaline\u2014began punching out a draft for the president-elect to read. But Ivanka took one glance over Miller\u2019s shoulder and concluded that it wouldn\u2019t do. (Someone who read it later summed up the tone as \u201cWe won; fuck you.\u201d) The next act of the Trump story was beginning tonight. This was a task for family. Gathered around the dining-room table with a coterie of aides and allies, Trump\u2019s three oldest children took turns dictating while the speechwriter typed. The final product\u2014a laundry list of thank yous interspersed with patriotic platitudes\u2014was notable only for its un-Trumpian restraint. With his family lined up behind him onstage, Trump intoned, \u201cI pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.\u201d\n\nThe speech was bland and forgettable, but hall-of-fame oratory wasn\u2019t the goal. The remarks were a placeholder, a chance for the family to work out their next moves. \u201cThey\u2019re undeniably adaptable,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to the president, told me of Trump\u2019s children. \u201cWhen the family business was real estate, they learned contracts and building approvals and architecture. Then it was television, and they learned that industry. Now, a decade later, they\u2019ve turned around and learned politics.\u201d But this latest reinvention has set off a power struggle within the first family, one that has played out largely away from public view. The president and his children\u2014who declined to be interviewed for this story\u2014have labored to project an image of unity. But over the past several months, I spoke with dozens of people close to the Trumps, including friends, former employees, White House officials, and campaign aides. The succession battle they described is marked by old grievances, petty rivalries\u2014and deceptively high stakes. In his brief time on the political stage, Donald Trump has commandeered the national conservative movement, remade the Republican Party in his image, and used his office to confer untold value on the Trump brand. Between their business holdings and their political influence, the Trumps could remain a fixture of American life for generations. The question now dividing the president\u2019s children is not just which one of them will get to take up the mantle when he\u2019s gone\u2014but how the family will attempt to shape the country in the years ahead.\n\nFor a nation founded in revolt against monarchy, the United States excels at preserving its own royalty. Once a name and fortune are made, the machinery of American power churns into gear. Wealth is passed down through trusts. Important jobs flow to unaccomplished heirs. Famous families get mythologized in the media, celebrated in the culture. The result is a ruling class dominated by dynasties\u2014from the Rockefellers to the Roosevelts, the Mellons to the Murdochs. Members of these clans tend to justify their privilege by claiming to uphold a tradition of patriotism and public service passed down by their forebears\u2014a refrain that has echoed especially throughout America\u2019s most durable political dynasty. The Trumps like to invoke the Kennedys in their own mythmaking. The president has called Melania \u201cour own Jackie O.\u201d Ivanka\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, whose father reportedly sees himself as a \u201cJewish Joe Kennedy,\u201d had a framed photo of JFK in his Manhattan office. And close Ivanka watchers have noted that her Instagram feed\u2014filled with idyllic photos of family life against the backdrop of the White House\u2014has a certain Camelotian quality. But if Camelot was always a romantic facade, the Trumps have dropped the ennobling pretense. Like a fun-house-mirror version of the Kennedys, they reel across the national stage swapping the language of duty and sacrifice for that of grievance and quid pro quo. Ask not what your country can do for you, they seem to say; ask what your country can do for the Trumps.\n\nIn considering which of his children should carry on his legacy, Trump is now caught between competing visions for the future of the family\u2014one defined by a desire for elite approval, the other by an instinct for stoking populist rage. But Stephen Hess, a scholar who studies American political dynasties, says succession can be unpredictable in presidential families. Unlike in business, where a patriarch can simply install his chosen heir as CEO, politicians often see their best-laid plans upended by voters: Think of the Bushes anointing brainy, well-behaved Jeb, only to have George W. surprise everyone by beating him to the White House. For Trump\u2014a distant and domineering father who has long pitted his offspring against one another\u2014the unsettling reality is that the choice of who will succeed him may be out of his control. II. The Trump children grew up surrounded by the trappings of dynasty. Their home was an eponymous skyscraper\u2014all glass and gold and capital letters\u2014that doubled as a symbol of their family\u2019s power. Famous surnames can have an enveloping effect on those who carry them, flattening every outside aspiration until the family is all that matters. To young Don, Ivanka, and Eric, the whole world felt as if it could fit within Trump Tower. From afar, their lives looked like a Richie Rich\u2013style fantasy. They had an entire floor of the triplex penthouse to themselves, with rooms full of toys and big-screen TVs, and nannies and bodyguards attending to their whims. Michael Jackson, their neighbor, stopped by to play video games. Limousines shepherded them around the city.\n\nBut within the family their father cultivated a Darwinian dynamic. On ski trips, when they raced down the mountain, Trump would jab at his children with a pole to get ahead of them. His favorite fatherly maxim was \u201cDon\u2019t trust anyone\u201d\u2014and he liked to test his children by asking whether they trusted him. If they said yes, they were reprimanded. Sibling rivalry flourished. \u201cWe were sort of bred to be competitive,\u201d Ivanka said in 2004. \u201cDad encourages it.\u201d (Tiffany and Barron, born later to different mothers, seem to have been spared from this contest.) For Trump\u2019s three oldest kids, the defining drama of their childhoods came in 1990, when he left their mother for Marla Maples, moving out of the penthouse amid a tabloid feeding frenzy. Eric, then 6, was too young to fully grasp what was happening, but his siblings understood, and they reacted in different ways. Don, who was 12, lashed out at his father\u2014\u201cHow can you say you love us?\u201d he reportedly spat during an argument\u2014and refused to talk to him for a year. Eight-year-old Ivanka was afraid of what she might lose in the divorce. \u201cDoes it mean I\u2019m not going to be Ivanka Trump anymore?\u201d she asked, tearfully. In the years that followed, Don seemed to define himself in opposition to his father. Trump loved golf, so Don stayed off the links. Trump was a teetotaler, so Don drank heavily. In his college fraternity, he developed a reputation for blacking out. \u201cHe was drinking himself into a really dark place,\u201d said one former fraternity brother, who recalled Don breaking down in tears at a party as he talked about his father. \u201cHe hated what his dad did to his mom. For a while, he didn\u2019t even want people to know his last name.\u201d (A spokesperson for Don said: \u201cThis is fiction.\u201d)\n\nIvanka, meanwhile, worked to stay close with her father. She stopped by his office every day after the divorce, and when she was at boarding school she called home often\u2014seeking his advice, and asking questions about the family business. Later, Ivanka would recall with pride how her dad interrupted important meetings to talk to her: \u201cHe\u2019d always take my call.\u201d On June 16, 2015, Ivanka strode across a dais in the atrium of Trump Tower and beamed out at the crowd. \u201cWelcome, everybody,\u201d she said, a glint of amusement in her voice. \u201cToday, I have the honor of introducing a man who needs no introduction.\u201d That Donald Trump had chosen Ivanka to feature so prominently at his campaign kickoff seemed natural. He\u2019d been grooming her for years to take over the family empire. She was the golden child\u2014beautiful, telegenic, and in possession of that most important family trait: a compulsive image-consciousness. According to an aide who helped launch Trump\u2019s presidential bid, Ivanka was the one child for whom he voiced concern while he was deciding whether to run. \u201cI know they\u2019re gonna go after me for the women,\u201d Trump told the aide. \u201cThe problem is, they\u2019re gonna go after Ivanka, too, for the ex-boyfriends.\u201d His daughter\u2019s romantic history included a succession of problematic exes\u2014from Lance Armstrong to James \u201cBingo\u201d Gubelmann, a D\u2011list film producer who would later be arrested on cocaine charges with Maroon 5\u2019s bassist.\n\nIvanka had a brand to protect, something Trump understood. She\u2019d been tending to her image since she was a teenager\u2014carefully evolving the Ivanka persona from party-girl socialite to lean-in lifestyle guru. She had her own fashion line and a flagship boutique in SoHo. Alongside Jared\u2014another real-estate scion\u2014she had wedged herself into Upper East Side society, earning invites to exclusive charity functions and a cameo on Gossip Girl. Campaign staffers grumbled that Ivanka\u2019s policy preferences were more closely aligned with Aspen weekenders than Rust Belt voters. Ivanka may not have thought her father could win the presidency, but she chose to treat the campaign as a brand-enhancement vehicle. She posed for glossy magazines, and sat for soft-focus interviews on Good Morning America. After speaking at the Republican National Convention, she served her Twitter followers a link to the pink sheath dress she\u2019d worn onstage and encouraged them to \u201cshop Ivanka\u2019s look.\u201d The dress sold out within 24 hours, a sign of the broader strategy\u2019s success: In the first half of 2016, Fast Company reported, net sales at her clothing line were up nearly $12 million. Navigating the campaign this way required finesse. Ivanka kept her distance from the uncouth rallies in places like Reno, Nevada, and Toledo, Ohio. While Trump riled up the country with Muslim-ban proposals and Mexican-rapist panics, she perched herself on a higher plane, where she just wanted to talk about the issues that really mattered to her, like affordable child care and the gender pay gap. Campaign staffers grumbled that Ivanka\u2019s policy preferences were more closely aligned with Aspen weekenders than Rust Belt voters. \u201cPeople started to realize this wasn\u2019t about Trump\u2019s vision,\u201d one former aide told me. \u201cIt was about Ivanka\u2019s ability to feel comfortable in her New York circle.\u201d\n\nBut few were willing to challenge her. Rumors swirled that a state-level staffer had been fired after displeasing Ivanka. True or not\u2014a spokesperson for Ivanka declined to comment\u2014the story reinforced an impression that the candidate\u2019s favorite child was untouchable. \u201cIt all felt very Tudor,\u201d said the former aide. \u201cAside from whispers in the bathroom, nobody would dare say anything bad about Ivanka. It was the kind of thing that would get you tarred and feathered.\u201d While Ivanka soaked up the spotlight, Don was consigned to the margins of the campaign. The two had long been a study in contrasts. Where she whispered, he shouted; where she was careful, he was reckless. Unlike Ivanka\u2014who couldn\u2019t wait to follow her dad into real estate\u2014Don had taken a more leisurely path to the family business after college, bartending and bumming around Colorado for a year and a half while his father seethed. Read: Donald Trump Jr., the troublemaker With his slicked-back hair and pin-striped suits, Don had carried a certain fratty energy into adulthood that periodically got him into trouble. (In 2002, Page Six reported that he got a beer stein to the head at a New York comedy club after some patrons thought he was \u201creacting too enthusiastically to [Chris Rock\u2019s] ethnic humor.\u201d) He spent weekdays working at the Trump Organization, where he developed a millionaire\u2019s belief in low taxes, and weekends in the wilderness with his hunting buddies, where he gained an appreciation for gun rights. As a result, Don came to conservatism years before the rest of his family.\n\nYet when Don offered to help his father\u2019s campaign, many of the tasks he received had a whiff of condescension. Trump had always been embarrassed by his son\u2019s hunting, especially after photos emerged in 2012 of Don posing with the severed tail of an elephant he\u2019d slain in Zimbabwe. But now that the candidate was wooing rural Republicans, he was happy to let Don put on that goofy orange vest and shoot at stuff for the cameras. \u201cYou can finally do something for me,\u201d Trump told Don, according to a former aide. Don had long ago come to understand that Ivanka was his father\u2019s favorite. \u201cDaddy\u2019s little girl!\u201d he liked to joke. But making peace with her husband\u2019s status in the family was harder. Ever since Ivanka had married Jared, Don had been made to watch as this effete, soft-spoken interloper cozied up to his dad. \u201cThe brothers thought Jared was a yes-man,\u201d said a former Trump adviser. \u201cDon, especially, looked at him as very suspect.\u201d But Ivanka and Jared\u2019s real power was rooted in Trump\u2019s aspirations for the family. The couple stood as avatars for the elite respectability he\u2019d spent his life futilely chasing. They belonged to a world that had long excluded him, dined in penthouses where he\u2019d been derided as a nouveau riche rube. Cultivated and urbane, they embodied the high-class, patrician ideal he so desperately wanted the Trump name to evoke. Don\u2014the screwup, the blowhard, the hunter\u2014didn\u2019t stand a chance. Tensions between Don and Jared sharpened in the spring of 2016, as it became clear that Trump was going to fire his campaign manager. With Corey Lewandowski on the way out, Don and Jared each began vying for larger roles in the campaign, according to two Republican operatives who worked for Trump.\n\nPeople close to the candidate knew he would never entrust his campaign to his son\u2014Don\u2019s chances of taking the reins were \u201cless than zero,\u201d a former adviser told me. But Don seemed like the last one to realize it. He hustled to prove that he was up to the task, swapping texts and emails with anyone who said they could help his dad\u2019s candidacy. It was during this period that Don set up a meeting with a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton. \u201cThe Trump Tower meeting was Don\u2019s move to take over the campaign,\u201d a former aide told me. \u201cHe was trying to show his father he was competent.\u201d (The spokesperson for Don said: \u201cMore fiction.\u201d) The full extent of the mess Don was making wouldn\u2019t be clear for another year. But even in the moment, the meeting was a bust. The Russians rambled about adoption policy, Jared emailed his assistant looking for an excuse to leave, and no useful intel was produced. Don had wasted everybody\u2019s time. Jared and Ivanka took a savvier approach to consolidating power, cultivating the new campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, as an ally. By the fall, Jared was traveling virtually full-time with Trump on his private plane, while Don was sent to stump in far-flung states no one else had time for. \u201cI just wake up in the morning and go to whatever city they tell me to,\u201d Don complained during one trip, according to a travel companion. \u201cJared\u2019s the smart one. He has it all figured out.\u201d\n\nBut Don discovered that he had a knack for campaigning. Bounding into county fairs and hunting expos in boots and blue jeans, he dazzled crowds with his knowledge of duck blinds and fly-fishing\u2014sounding more like a Trump voter than a Trump. He thrived in the shouty, testosterone-soaked realm of #MAGA Twitter, where his provocations routinely went viral. Don\u2019s habit of amplifying memes from the right-wing fever swamps generated controversy. (One infamous tweet compared Syrian refugees to poisonous Skittles; another featured the alt-right mascot Pepe the Frog.) But it also helped turn him into a kind of Breitbartian folk hero. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the bros,\u201d Mike Cernovich, a popular far-right social-media personality, told me. \u201cHe has a classically masculine personality, and you don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s a snob. He really likes the meme culture\u2014it\u2019s not fake for him.\u201d Don may have lost the inside game to Jared and Ivanka, but he was building a grassroots base of his own. When fans began calling on him to run for mayor of New York City\u2014and Don responded with a bit too much enthusiasm\u2014his father quickly shut it down. \u201cDon\u2019s not going to run for mayor,\u201d he said in an interview with Sean Hannity. But Trump couldn\u2019t put an end to his son\u2019s political career that easily. By the end of the election, Don\u2019s budding #MAGA stardom was undeniable\u2014and he had no intention of walking away. \u201cGoing back to doing deals is boring,\u201d he reportedly told a gathering of gun enthusiasts. \u201cThe politics bug bit me.\u201d\n\nIII. With the election over and the presidency in hand, the Trumps got to work doing what they did with any new asset: figuring out how to sell it. Their initial cash grabs were clumsy and relatively small-scale. When the soon-to-be first family was profiled by 60 Minutes, Ivanka\u2019s jewelry line blasted out a \u201cStyle Alert\u201d advertising the $10,800 bracelet she\u2019d worn on air. When Trump met with the prime minister of Japan, Ivanka\u2014who was pursuing a licensing deal with a Japanese apparel conglomerate\u2014sat in on the meeting. As ProPublica would later reveal, she also helped ensure that a portion of her father\u2019s inauguration budget was spent at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Eric and Don\u2014tasked with running the Trump Organization while their father was away\u2014looked for their own angles. They doubled the membership fee at Mar-a-Lago, which was already being described as the \u201cwinter White House,\u201d and pushed forward on the development of their down-market hotel chain, American Idea. Working with a pair of Mississippi businessmen they\u2019d met on the campaign trail, the Trumps planned a series of red-state budget hotels stuffed with star-spangled tchotchkes and decorative Americana, such as vintage Coca-Cola machines in the lobbies. Eric in particular welcomed the challenge of running the family business. He\u2019d always been the one most interested in construction and architecture, and many in the company assumed that he would take over day-to-day operations when his father retired. Now that he had a chance to prove himself, Eric planned to exploit every opportunity. \u201cThe stars have aligned,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cOur brand is the hottest it has ever been.\u201d\n\nJared, meanwhile, was busy attending to his own brand. When the December 20, 2016, issue of Forbes hit newsstands, the cover featured Trump\u2019s favored son-in-law\u2014his arms folded, his lapels peaked, his hair a perfect coif\u2014grinning triumphantly above a headline that seemed tailored to torment Don and Eric: \u201cthis guy got trump elected.\u201d Inside, readers were introduced to a heretofore unfamiliar version of Jared: the visionary strategist who had run the Trump campaign like a \u201cstealth Silicon Valley startup.\u201d The brazen credit-grabbing rankled people who\u2019d worked on the campaign. \u201cHe never sacrificed or risked a thing,\u201d a former staffer complained. \u201cThen, after the win, he came in to grab the spoils and anoint himself grand pooh-bah. It was gross.\u201d Don and Eric were similarly vexed, according to people close to the family. Jared had wasted little time in wielding his influence. Just days after the election, he\u2019d persuaded Trump to fire Chris Christie as the head of the transition team. Christie had been the federal prosecutor responsible for putting Jared\u2019s father behind bars a decade earlier, and the dismissal was widely interpreted as an act of vengeance. But the shake-up also gave Jared a strategic advantage, allowing him to exert control over hiring for the new administration. Don was not happy with this arrangement. More than once, according to aides familiar with the process, he would recommend someone for a job only to have Jared intervene and insist that personnel decisions be run through him. Worse, Jared seemed intent on staffing the Trump White House like it was a charter jet to Davos. He recruited Gary Cohn, a Goldman Sachs executive and registered Democrat, to serve as the president\u2019s chief economic adviser. He lobbied for Steven Mnuchin, a hedge-funder cum Hollywood producer, to be named Treasury secretary. Don managed to usher a handful of loyalists into his father\u2019s administration\u2014but Jared and Ivanka ended up with many more.\n\nPeople close to Trump speculated about what Jared was hoping to get out of all this. Some thought he was simply seizing the chance to fill his Rolodex with world leaders and Wall Street titans. Others would later point to a sweetheart deal his family cut with a Qatari investment firm as evidence that Jared\u2019s involvement in foreign policy had a profit motive. (A spokesman for Jared denied this.) Whatever the reason, the couple\u2019s headlong dive into politics proved difficult to reconcile with Ivanka\u2019s brand. As the inauguration approached, she found herself under siege on the Upper East Side. A horde of New York artists\u2014including some whose work she personally collected\u2014gathered outside a downtown building where she kept an apartment to protest her role in Trump\u2019s \u201cfascist\u201d agenda. Activists launched a viral Instagram campaign juxtaposing her glamour shots with appeals from frightened constituents: \u201cDear Ivanka, I\u2019ve been raped and I need to have an abortion\u201d; \u201cDear Ivanka, I\u2019m afraid of the swastikas spray painted on my park.\u201d This struck Ivanka as profoundly unfair. She\u2014the author of a forthcoming book on women in the workplace and frequent participant in female-empowerment luncheons\u2014was a misogynist? She\u2014a convert to orthodox Judaism and supporter of numerous respected Jewish charities\u2014was an anti-Semite? What did these people expect her to do, disown her father? But as much as the attacks bothered Ivanka, they also made something clear: The White House wasn\u2019t going to boost her lifestyle business\u2014if anything, the coming years would politicize it beyond repair. To take advantage of this moment, she would need to think bigger. Fortunately for Ivanka, A\u2011list celebrities and thought leaders were now flocking to her. Leonardo DiCaprio, Sheryl Sandberg, Anne-Marie Slaughter\u2014all of them wanted a spot on her calendar. She didn\u2019t need to sell handbags or luxury condos to command the attention of America\u2019s elite. Her proximity to the Oval Office was enough.\n\nThe week before Trump entered the White House, Ivanka announced that she was taking a leave of absence from the Trump Organization and her fashion line. The seat of the family empire wasn\u2019t in Manhattan anymore. It was in Washington\u2014and that\u2019s where she and Jared would be. IV. The American presidency has always been shaped, for better or worse, by unelected family members. Hillary Clinton was the architect of her husband\u2019s health-care plan. Bobby Kennedy served as his brother\u2019s attorney general. Eleanor Roosevelt traveled the country on behalf of her wheelchair-bound husband to survey New Deal programs, and Edith Wilson is said to have effectively run the White House after Woodrow suffered a stroke. Still, modern presidents do not, as a rule, hire their children to work in the West Wing. So when, in March 2017, Trump made Ivanka an assistant to the president, and Jared a senior adviser, the appointments attracted more than a few critics. Some compared Trump to a third-world autocrat stacking his regime with relatives. But Ivanka was certain the naysayers would thank her in the end. Her confidence was not unreasonable. People close to the Trump family had long marveled at how Ivanka handled her father. The playful Aw, Dad eye rolls, the giggles at his jokes, the strategically deployed fawning followed by subtly asked-for favors\u2014these little performances, honed over a lifetime, had taken on an almost mythical quality among Trump\u2019s friends and employees, who say no one\u2019s better at getting what they want from him. Trump reportedly began telling allies, \u201cJared hasn\u2019t been so good for me,\u201d and lamenting that Ivanka could have married Tom Brady. The presidential agenda Ivanka envisioned was one her former Manhattan neighbors would approve of. With her help, Trump would enact a paid-family-leave program and reform the criminal-justice system. He would update the nation\u2019s infrastructure, and preserve LGBTQ rights. Republican, Democrat, these were just labels. Once fair-minded people saw what her father had accomplished\u2014what the Trumps had accomplished\u2014the family\u2019s legacy would be secure.\n\nThe first test of Ivanka\u2019s persuasive powers came when White House officials began drafting an executive order focused on expanding protections for religious conservatives. Ivanka, who knew the order would be seen as anti-LGBTQ, enlisted Tim Cook\u2014the gay Apple CEO, whose respect her father craved\u2014to lobby Trump against signing it, according to a former White House aide. She also privately reminded her father that Vice President Mike Pence had faced nasty political blowback when he\u2019d stumbled into a religious-freedom culture war as governor of Indiana. Ivanka\u2019s crusade culminated one night in the president\u2019s private study, where Trump was discussing the issue with a small group of advisers. A former aide who was present at the meeting recalled Pence launching into an impassioned defense of the executive order, only to have Trump cut him off. \u201cMike, isn\u2019t this the shit that got you in trouble in Indiana?\u201d he snapped. Pence quickly retreated as blood rushed to his face. It was clear to all in the room that Ivanka\u2014standing quietly in the corner\u2014had won. When Trump did eventually sign the order, it had been dramatically watered down. But as time went on, Trump began to tire of Ivanka and Jared\u2019s incessant lobbying. Every time he turned around, they were nagging him about something new\u2014refugees one day, education the next. It never stopped. Their efforts to change his mind about the Paris climate accord exasperated the president, who took to mocking their arguments when they weren\u2019t around. \u201cThey\u2019re New York liberals,\u201d he would say, according to a former White House aide. \u201cOf course that\u2019s what they think.\u201d", "description": "\u2026 and control the MAGA empire", "authors": ["Mckay Coppins"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/09/TheAtlantic_CoverArt_LEAD/facebook.jpg?1567804377", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
