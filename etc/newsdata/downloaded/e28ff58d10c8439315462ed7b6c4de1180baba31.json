There was concern that a second wave of catastrophic attacks was imminent, including a possible attack involving weapons of mass destruction. In response, as Philip Mudd writes in this riveting and authoritative account, President George W. Bush ordered the intelligence community, led by the CIA, to \u201cdo whatever it takes to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nOne measure, which is the subject of this account, became one of the most controversial programs in America\u2019s intelligence history. Beginning in 2002, secret \u201cblack site\u201d CIA detention facilities were established in several allied countries, where more than 100 al Qaeda prisoners were confined, and subjected to a variety of interrogation methods, including what are termed Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (for EITs), that were designed to compel al Qaeda prisoners to reveal timely information that was urgently required to protect the nation from forthcoming attacks.\n\nAlthough considerable information about this program and its leading participants has been revealed in various publications, Mr. Mudd offers new details about how this program was managed and its contribution to weakening al Qaeda. The author is well placed to discuss these issues as a former deputy director of the CIA\u2019s Counterterrorism Center (CTC) during the period covered in the account, after which he became head of the FBI\u2019s National Security Branch. Currently, he\u2019s a regular CNN commentator on national security issues.\n\nAs Mr. Mudd explains, this new program represented a paradigm shift for the CIA, with an intensified intelligence-driven campaign to quickly fuse its own intelligence with information from other agencies, including foreign intelligence services, to dismantle al Qaeda\u2019s global network. The urgency of this new campaign was governed by a catchphrase in the intelligence world that \u201cIt\u2019s always what you don\u2019t know that will kill you.\u201d As the author adds, \u201cOn al-Qa\u2019ida Agency officials thought they knew precious little. They were reading secret messages from al-Qa\u2019ida, but they had little access to al-Qa\u2019ida players by CIA human informants.\u201d Thus, penetrating al Qaeda\u2019s inner circle as quickly as possible was crucial to defeating it.\n\nHaving had little experience in capturing and interrogating adversary jihadi terrorists on a large scale until the requirements to respond to al Qaeda\u2019s 9/11 attacks made this a national security priority, the author writes that it was only in the spring of 2002 that senior al Qaeda operatives were captured as the CTC \u201cmoved from being an Agency outlier to the core of the CIA\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nCapturing high level terrorist operatives also had a downside because after a detainee\u2019s capture, their terror organization \u201cknows it has lost one of its members. Plots are postponed but not abandoned; plotters and terror leaders reposition themselves, and terror coordinators and operatives alter communications methods or patterns.\n\nWith the need for timely intelligence to uncover al Qaeda\u2019s current and future plots and understanding its leadership structure a top priority, the CIA moved quickly to institutionalize this new program to hold and interrogate its captured terrorist operatives, particularly what to do with them prior to charging them formally to stand trial in the United States. This was a dilemma that required legal approval, the author explains, because unlike the FBI, which collects evidence as part of a chain of custody that is defensible in court, the CIA\u2019s manner of collecting intelligence is not detailed evidence, but often fragmentary intelligence about potential plots and insight about a terror organization and its leaders that differs from the type of evidence collected for a courtroom.\n\nA second issue was how to transfer the captured detainees who were generally found in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere, to another country for interrogation, since they couldn\u2019t be held in the United States for interrogation prior to their trial. In a practice known as \u201crendition,\u201d some of the terrorist detainees were transferred to their home country or a location that had a legal case against them. This posed various dilemmas, such as the types of methods used by a host country\u2019s security services to interrogate them and the actionable usefulness of the information from these interrogations that would be passed on to the United States.\n\nAnother dilemma was how to establish CIA-controlled \u201cblack site\u201d detention facilities in willing foreign partner countries without arousing publicity.\n\nWith the program ramping up quickly, a final challenge was recruiting professional interrogators, many of them contractors with previous experience in the U.S. military\u2019s interrogation programs.\n\nAlso interesting is the author\u2019s account \u2014 at least as much as he could reveal as a former intelligence official \u2014 about the interrogations of highly placed al Qaeda leaders such as Abu Zubaydah (a hands-on manager who \u201cmade things happen for the group, serving as an intermediary, arranging travel and helping to manage operations generally\u201d) and Khalid Sheikh Muhammed (reportedly, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks).\n\nIn September 2006, the program\u2019s terrorist detainees were transferred to Guantanamo Bay, with the U.S. military assuming control over it.\n\nThe author concludes that this program was successful in playing a role in \u201cblocking another catastrophic attack\u201d with the interrogation techniques used against al Qaeda\u2019s terrorists needing to be viewed as \u201crestricted to extreme periods in history.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Joshua Sinai is a Washington, DC-based consultant on counter-terrorism issues.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nBLACK SITE: THE CIA IN THE POST-9/11 WORLD\n\nBy Philip Mudd\n\nLiveright, $27.95, 272 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
