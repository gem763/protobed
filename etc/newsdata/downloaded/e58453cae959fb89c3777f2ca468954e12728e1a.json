You never know. No promises though,\u2019 she told ET Online last month. \u2018\n\nSarah has starred in eight seasons of Ryan Murphy\u2019s horror anthology (Picture: FX)\n\nSarah isn\u2019t the only American Horror Story favourite to be absent from the current series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvan Peters stepped down from the horror anthology for the first time since it began back in 2011, albeit temporarily.\n\nHis decision comes after he admitted in an interview last year that the tough roles were \u2018hurting his soul\u2019 and the dark subject matter was proving to get the best of him after nearly a decade.\n\nDuring an interview with GQ magazine, he said: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m not doing it anymore. I just made a decision. I said to myself, \u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d It\u2019s not me. It\u2019s not who I am!\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m goofy, I\u2019m silly, I like to have fun,\u2019 he added. \u2018I don\u2019t like to yell and scream. I actually hate it.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s disgusting and really awful, and it\u2019s been a challenge for me.
