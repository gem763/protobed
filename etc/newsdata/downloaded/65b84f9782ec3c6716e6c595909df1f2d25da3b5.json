And today its cash machine hole in the wall is boarded up, with 'Danger! Keep Out!' the only welcome sign that greets would-be customers abandoned by the bank.\n\nThe coffee shop next door is also shuttered up \u2013 closed since this last bank in town left three years ago.\n\nRural Wales has been hit harder than most by branch closures. In the Clwyd South constituency nearly all branches have been culled \u2013 it now has just a part-time Barclays in Llangollen to serve this 70,000-strong community.\n\nThe banks would have us believe these closures are driven by demand for online banking \u2013 despite most people saying they still want to visit a branch. Yet in Clwyd South, internet reception is at best patchy \u2013 making online banking impractical.\n\nHave you been affected by the bank branch cull? Email toby.walne@mailonsunday.co.uk\n\nGrocer Mike Hughes lives two doors away from the closed-down HSBC in Chirk. Takings at his fruit and vegetable shop are down 40 per cent since the bank deserted the town.\n\nHe says: 'HSBC is my bank and the effect its closure has had on the community is truly devastating. It is a nightmare for my business as now many prefer to go shopping where there is a bank.'\n\nHeidi Nash is out in Chirk with three-year-old son Jack, buying some Welsh lamb chops from butcher Jamie Ward's. The mother-of-six hands over a crisp \u00a310 note for payment.\n\nShe says: 'Access to cash is essential and like many people here l prefer using it for budgeting rather than paying by card. There is a hole in the wall cash machine at the local Spar shop but it is often out of order. Banks are taking away our basic right to transact with money. This should not be allowed.'\n\nWales has lost 239 branches since the start of 2015. In Clwyd South not only has the bank in Chirk been axed but another HSBC branch was axed six miles north in Ruabon three years ago. NatWest shut branches in Llangollen and Corwen a year earlier. Now locals must drive eight miles south to Oswestry if they want to find a bank branch \u2013 or take a 45-minute bus ride if they do not have a car.\n\nDevastated: Grocer Mike Hughes says takings are down by 40 per cent\n\nTourists trapped without any money\n\nVisiting holidaymakers are also struggling with the lack of bank branches in the region. Last week, John Williamson was crossing the 1,000-foot-long Pontcysyllte Aquaduct on a 70ft canal boat with his family. The 38-metre-high crossing is three miles north west of Chirk.\n\nThe 64-year-old joiner says: 'We came up from Devon a week ago \u2013 and had to come armed with piles of cash as it is hard to get hold of any around here. It is all very well banks telling us to bank online but you struggle to get a phone signal let alone the internet here on holiday.'\n\nIn the bustling market town of Llangollen, a branch of Barclays is the only remaining bank for a dozen miles. The branch only opens three days a week and paint is peeling off the windows and signage.\n\nOur manifesto to make banks listen The Mail on Sunday has drawn up a \u2018Keep Our Cash\u2019 manifesto to force banks to support local communities. Every town should have at least one bank.\n\nEvery town should have a free cash machine.\n\nEvery town should have a post office.\n\nFor smaller communities without a bank, post office or free cash machine, \u2018cashback\u2019 facilities must be offered for free at local shops and pubs.\n\nA regulator must take charge to ensure that there is free access to cash for everyone who wants it.\n\nDan Basford, a Barclays business customer and owner of the local Llan Velo bike shop, says: 'When I recently asked bank staff about the branch's future, they said it was committed to staying open.\n\n'Despite the welcome U-turn by Barclays to continue letting customers take out cash from our post office I still fear for the branch's future.'\n\nBarclays' outside cashpoint has a queue of customers. Up the road the old NatWest branch has been turned into a sports shop but there is still a cash machine outside. Sadly it's not working.\n\nRetired Royal Welch Fusilier Tony Hughes has kept his military manner despite retiring 20 years ago. The 83-year-old widower is dressed smartly in a tie and polished shoes \u2013 just to go shopping.\n\nHe says: 'There used to be four banks in Llangollen but we're down to one \u2013 and a part-time one at that. Online banking is just not for me and I prefer to pay for everything by cash. It is an inconvenient truth the banks do not want to hear.'\n\nRecently, Barclays pledged not to close down 100 branches that are 'the last bank in town' for at least two years. This is after shutting 243 branches in the past couple of years. Another round of culling is expected to start again in earnest from 2021.\n\nIn Wales NatWest has axed 70 branches over the past three years while Barclays has cut 54, HSBC 46 and Lloyds 32.\n\nCommunity cut off from free cash\n\nThe rural village of Cerrigydrudion in Conwy \u2013 20 miles west of Llangollen \u2013 sits at the heart of a farming community where the nearest free cash machine is more than eight miles away.\n\nAbandoned: Chirk has no banks now the HSBC branch has closed\n\nIt takes at least half an hour to drive to the nearest bank. A post office counter at the back of the 'Siop Uwchaled' store helps bank customers access cash during opening hours, while there is a standalone Cashzone ATM outside a closed caf\u00e9 charging 95p for withdrawals.\n\nShop assistant Jane Branch admits the banking situation in the village is dire. She says: 'I can imagine people putting money under the mattress like they used to do in the old days.'\n\nPostman Geraint Evans reluctantly pays his 95p to take out \u00a360 at the cash machine. He says: 'The banks don't care two hoots about us. I have to drive for half an hour if I want to use my HSBC bank in Ruthin. It is a pain in the backside.'\n\nThe markings of 'Midland Bank' can still be made out on a grand stone house in the heart of the village \u2013 a reminder of better banking times. This bank had been an HSBC branch until closing in 2015. Beside it is a sign pointing out that Ruthin (Welsh spelling Rhuthun) is 14 miles away.\n\nThe number of free cash machines countrywide reduced by more than 10 per cent in the year to March 2019. In North Wales, 49 free cash machines were axed, a number from Clwyd South.\n\nFarmers are isolated from banks\n\nNestled high up in the hills overlooking Denbigh Moors \u2013 with the mountain peaks of Snowdonia visible in the distance \u2013 is the cattle and sheep farm of Fron Heulog.\n\nFarmer Gwinfor Price is feeding cattle as he prepares for a long winter ahead \u2013 where bad weather means the farm can be cut off from the outside world for up to a fortnight. But the 75-year-old already feels isolated from the banks.\n\nHe says: 'The only chance I get to do any banking now is when visiting the cattle market in Mold, some 30 miles away. It takes a whole morning to get there and back. Banks should show some social responsibility towards communities that make them their money and they should not be allowed to simply fleece us.'\n\nResearch by consumer group Which? shows that banks are closing branches at the rate of 55 a month \u2013 with more than 3,300 axed in the past three years. Wales tops the list for bank closures.\n\nGareth Shaw, head of money at consumer body Which?, says: 'Wales has lost more than two-fifths of its branch network \u2013 in some areas four out of five banks have gone.\n\n'Regions such as Clwyd South, where only one branch is still open, are on a knife edge in terms of survival, struggling without both adequate banking services and the basic right to access cash.'", "description": "Chirk in North Wales has survived more than its fair share of bitter strife in the past 700 years.
