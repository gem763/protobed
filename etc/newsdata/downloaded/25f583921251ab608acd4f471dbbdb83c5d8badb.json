That's because you're dehydrated,' she said.\n\nThis info-graphic outlines how quickly your health can improve after stopping drinking for just two weeks\n\nWhat happens in week two?\n\nOne of the benefits of quitting alcohol is that if you suffer gut issues, these will improve.\n\nDr Adams explained alcohol can irritate the stomach lining which can cause gastritis and reflux.\n\nSymptoms of gastritis can include nausea and vomiting, bloating, and upper abdominal pain while acid reflux causes heartburn.\n\nYou may find you also lose weight after you stop drinking.\n\nThis is because alcohol is full of empty calories, meaning they contain no nutritional value whatsoever.\n\nAfter two weeks of quitting drinking, you will have noticed an improvement in your gut health\n\nSydney-based GP Dr Penny Adams has explained how your health improves within a month of quitting drinking\n\nWhat happens in week three?\n\nBy week three your heart health will improve and your blood pressure will be down.\n\nRegularly drinking more than the recommended intake can cause alcohol-related hypertension (high blood pressure).\n\n'Alcohol is actually quite an irritant to the heart - it irritates the electrical system of the heart and can cause palpitations and it's also quite toxic to cardiac muscle and long term drinking can actually cause cardiomyopathy,' Dr Adams said.\n\nWhat happens in week four?\n\nWhen week four rolls around, Dr Adams suggests booking in with your GP for a liver function test.\n\nThis is because drinking to excess regularly may result in a fatty liver, a condition which can affect how this organ functions.\n\nBy week four, your complexion will have started to improve thanks to an influx of vital vitamins and nutrients\n\nChances are by the end of the month, your liver function will have improved, and not only will you feel better, but you'll also look better too.\n\nDrinking too much is thought to deprive the skin of vital vitamins and nutrients which means after a month of abstaining, a dry and uneven complexion will have also settled.\n\nWhat can happen after a year?\n\nAfter 12 months of quitting, your body will be in top form and its likely you'll have shed a total of six kilograms.\n\nAdditionally, of chronic conditions including breast, liver and mouth cancers also reduces.\n\nSpeaking previously to Daily Mail Australia, dietitian Jenny Champion said those who regularly overshot the mark could damage their body in myriad and lasting ways.\n\n'Once you exceed one standard drink per hour, you are placing yourself at an increased risk of cardiac disease, as well as being more prone to extra energy intake through poor food choices which leads to weight gain and long term health implications.'\n\nIf alcohol is a problem for you or someone you know, it may be time to seek advice from a professional.
