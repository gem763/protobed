It is crazy!\u201d McCormack -- who plays Will Truman on the series -- told Us Weekly at the Project Angel Food Angel Awards Gala on Saturday. \u201cI think people worried about that entirely too much.\u201d\n\nDEMI LOVATO RETURNS TO ACTING WITH 'WILL & GRACE' ROLE\n\nThe 56-year-old actor added that the relationship between Messing (Grace Adler), Mullally (Karen Walker), himself and co-star Sean Hayes (Jack McFarland) is similar to a \"house on fire.\" \u201cThe four of us get along like a house on fire, we always have,\" he shared.\n\nAccording to the magazine, rumors about the ladies allegedly not being on friendly terms started earlier this year after fans claimed the two had stopped following each other on Instagram.\n\n'WILL & GRACE' REBOOT TO END WITH UPCOMING SEASON\n\nAs for why the show is ending after its upcoming 2020 season, McCormack explained that they \"want to make sure that it ends up properly, that we go out on top, that it never gets sort of lost in the shuffle.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to go out, I think those 18 episodes airing in a row, NBC\u2019s doing it all at once, which I used to love that. So it\u2019s going to go big. It\u2019s going to go out in a way that I\u2019m really going to be proud of.\u201d", "description": "Rumors of an alleged feud between \"Will & Grace\" co-stars, Debra Messing and Megan Mullally, have been swirling for months -- and Eric McCormack is putting them to rest.", "authors": ["Mariah Haas"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Messing-McCormack-Mullally-Reuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
