Brunel denied both of these charges.\n\nBrunel reportedly vanished after Epstein\u2019s jailhouse suicide, and French prosecutors want to speak to him about Epstein's abuse of minors abroad. Last week, cops searched his Parisian home and the offices of Karin Models, the agency Brunel led before launching MC2 Model Management. Brunel created the agency MC2 in 2005, reportedly with $1 million from Epstein, who regularly housed Brunel and MC2 models at his Manhattan apartments, according to the testimony of a former MC2 bookkeeper.\n\nBut while Brunel has dodged the press in recent years, he\u2019s allegedly already sold MC2\u2019s assets in New York and is currently in a deal to sell MC2 in Miami. The French agent also helped to create at least two new boutique modeling firms: The Identity Models in New York and 1 Mother Agency in Kyiv, Ukraine, former employees say.\n\nThe New York office of MC2, according to one MC2 lawyer, sold its assets to a new firm called The Identity Models in 2017.\n\nAnd MC2\u2019s Miami location is allegedly in the process of transferring its assets to The Source Models, an agency run by MC2 executives Jeff Fuller and Petra Pedraza. A representative for The Source said MC2's location in Miami will shut down.\n\nStaff at MC2\u2019s third location in Tel Aviv did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBrunel has claimed MC2 lost business over his ties to Epstein. In 2015, he filed a lawsuit in Florida state court against the financier, claiming, \u201cMC2 was worth millions of dollars; now, due to the illegal actions of Epstein, MC2 is almost worthless.\u201d\n\nThe fashion industry veteran also denied any connection to Epstein's sexual pyramid scheme\u2014which involved enlisting underage girls for \u201cmassages\u201d in his Palm Beach and New York mansions. Epstein would molest the girls or even rape them, and had some of his victims recruit even more minors for him to abuse.\n\nBut Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims Epstein kept her as his \u201csex slave,\u201d identified Brunel as a purveyor of minor girls. In a 2015 affidavit, Giuffre said Epstein groomed her for sex with his powerful friends including Brunel and Prince Andrew (who also denies the allegations).\n\n\u201cBrunel would offer the girls \u2018modeling\u2019 jobs. A lot of the girls came from poor countries or poor backgrounds, and he lured them in with a promise of making good money,\u201d Giuffre stated, adding that Brunel joined Epstein and gal pal Ghislaine Maxwell for orgies with children in locations including the U.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico and Palm Beach.\n\n\u201cJeffrey Epstein has told me that he has slept with over 1,000 of Brunel\u2019s girls, and everything that I have seen confirms this claim,\u201d Giuffre said.\n\n\u201c Jeffrey Epstein has told me that he has slept with over 1,000 of Brunel\u2019s girls, and everything that I have seen confirms this claim. \u201d \u2014 Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre\n\nSigrid McCawley, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner who represents Giuffre and other Epstein accusers, told The Daily Beast that Brunel should be on authorities\u2019 radar as a key participant in Epstein\u2019s child sex-trafficking ring.\n\n\u201cWe have to carefully look at the people who are around him and who are providing him with these females, and Jean-Luc Brunel was doing exactly that,\u201d McCawley said. \u201cHe was using the ruse of a modeling agency to bring Epstein young victims.\u201d\n\nSoon after Giuffre\u2019s claims made news, Brunel issued his only public comment on the matter: \u201cI strongly deny having participated, neither directly nor indirectly, in the actions Mr. Jeffrey Epstein is being accused of. I strongly deny having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or model agencies manager.\u201d\n\nStill, Brunel\u2019s bad publicity over Epstein may have led him to shutter the MC2 offices. At the same time, sources say, he helped in the creation of two other modeling agencies\u2014though his name does not appear on publicly available corporation records for either.\n\nMultiple former MC2 employees and models told The Daily Beast that Brunel was considered, at least at the beginning, as the man who helped create The Identity.\n\nAccording to its website, the agency \u201cwas founded in 2017 with the concept of a creative boutique to work on and develop different profiles while creating individual identities for those represented.\u201d\n\nThe Identity is run by Mathias Pardo, a French-born talent scout who is listed as \u201cvice president\u201d of the company in New York state corporation records. (The identities of the president or any other executives of the Delaware-incorporated firm aren't publicly known.)\n\n\u201c He was using the ruse of a modeling agency to bring Epstein young victims. \u201d \u2014 Sigrid McCawley, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner\n\nPardo, who for years worked with Brunel as an MC2 agent, told The Daily Beast that he owns and founded The Identity in 2018. He denied Brunel played a role in founding the modeling firm. \u201cMr. Brunel has absolutely nothing to do with The Identity,\u201d Pardo said in an email on Sept. 13. He did not return further messages.\n\nYet in 2017, one Identity model allegedly joined Pardo at New York's Mercer Kitchen for a meet-and-greet that included only one other person: Jean-Luc Brunel. According to the model's mother, Lea Assenmacher, the young woman showed both men her portfolio during the rendezvous at the chic Soho restaurant.\n\nThe model told her mother that Brunel was \u201cvery polite\u201d and \u201cdrank a lot of champagne,\u201d as they made small-talk about the fashion world. During their conversation, Assenmacher claimed, Brunel and Pardo indicated that MC2 would cease operations and The Identity would take its place. The girl signed a contract with The Identity soon after.\n\n\u201cShe felt Jean-Luc Brunel was the final arbiter\" of whether she was signed, Assenmacher told The Daily Beast. \u201cMathias was deferential to him.\u201d\n\nTwo former MC2 employees told The Daily Beast that initially, The Identity operated out of MC2\u2019s offices on West 14th Street. \u201cThe only ones working for The Identity was Mathias and Jean-Luc Brunel,\u201d one ex-staffer said, and referring to Brunel, added that it seemed like, \u201cThey just wanted to open another place without his name.\u201d\n\nSerena, a second former employee who asked to withhold her last name, said, \u201cI was around for a lot of the logistical conversations about the conversion into The Identity. It must\u2019ve turned over a month or two after I left, if even. But the goal of The Identity was the \u2018younger\u2019 faces would represent it while MC2 stayed the same, but I don\u2019t know if that happened.\u201d\n\nThe Identity shares the same attorney as MC2\u2014Ian Illych Martinez of Florida\u2014and houses its models at the same East Village apartment once used by MC2.\n\nMartinez also represents The Source Models and 1 Mother Agency, which Brunel allegedly founded in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2014, former employees and models say.\n\nThe Identity and MC2 share models and at least one other talent agent in common: former MC2 hand Vinicius Freire.\n\nAnd a review of The Identity\u2019s website shows that 20 of its 67 models are also currently signed with MC2 in Tel Aviv or Miami. At least 12 Identity models are also signed with 1 Mother Agency. (Some models have contracts with all three agencies.)\n\nIn an email, Martinez said Brunel is not an owner of The Identity. \u201cThe Identity Models, Inc., entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with MC2 Model Management, LLC. in 2017,\u201d Martinez wrote. \u201cThe Identity Model, Inc.\u2019s sole shareholder and one of two officers, is someone other than Mr. Brunel.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the October 16, 2017, Minutes of Organizational Meeting, two individuals\u2014neither of whom were Mr. Brunel\u2014were elected officers,\u201d the attorney continued. \u201cAny ownership allegations regarding Mr. Brunel or any other entity with his involvement is expressly denied and refuted by the corporate documents.\n\n\u201cOther than the aforementioned, there is no further comment regarding this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201c The goal of The Identity was the \u2018younger\u2019 faces would represent it while MC2 stayed the same. \u201d\n\nMartinez did not answer followup questions on Brunel\u2019s involvement with The Identity, The Source Models and 1 Mother.\n\nMeanwhile, Marcia Gomez, a spokeswoman for The Source Models, said the agency is owned by Pedraza and Fuller, who was Brunel\u2019s longtime business partner at MC2. Indeed, the contact email listed on The Source\u2019s Instagram page is an Mc2models.com address.\n\n\u201cMr. Brunel is not involved and has no connection whatsoever to this organization,\u201d Gomez said in an email. \u201cAdditionally, MC2 Miami will be ceasing operations.\u201d\n\nGomez said MC2 Miami\u2019s assets will be sold to The Source Models. (Fuller and Pedraza did not return messages seeking comment.)\n\nAsked why Fuller\u2019s wife, Hilary Altman, is the registered agent for the Ukrainian agency 1 Mother in Florida corporation filings, Gomez said, \u201cRecently, as an inducement for 1 st right of refusal in the Miami modeling market, Jeff\u2019s wife agreed to be the manager for the domestic company and be a liaison for this business.\u201d\n\n\"Mr. Brunel\u2019s involvement with 1 Mother was limited to providing a loan at its inception,\u201d Gomez added. \u201cOnce the loan was satisfied (several years ago), that completed his involvement with 1 Mother.\u201d\n\nReached by The Daily Beast, one model signed with 1 Mother said she believed Brunel was the owner of the agency and that she saw him at the Kyiv office last spring.\n\nAnother model who left 1 Mother told The Daily Beast that Brunel was the owner and that \"he came a few times to Ukraine to visit all models.\u201d\n\nBut Katya Talanova, CEO of the 1 Mother Agency, told The Daily Beast that she owns the firm\u2014not Brunel. \u201cWe had been working with MC2 Miami for some time,\u201d Talanova said in an email. \u201cThey had a first right of refusal because of loan that we had (that was covered long time ago).\u201d\n\nAsked about Brunel, Talanova said, \u201cMr. Brunel has nothing to do with 1 Mother Agency. He is out of business and doesn\u2019t have any connections with us.\u201d\n\nShe declined to answer follow-up questions on the loan she referenced.\n\nVladimir Yudashkin, who says he co-founded 1 Mother with Brunel in 2014, said the agency was the Frenchman's brainchild. \u201cJean-Luc approached me and we started to work together,\u201d Yudashkin told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cHe wanted models who worked for 1 Mother to think that they are booked to MC2 to represent them in New York because MC2 is the best choice for them\u2014not because MC2 is financially related to 1 Mother and 1 Mother has no other choice to work with MC2,\u201d Yudashkin said.\n\n\u201cWhen the time came to place the models in the U.S., Jean-Luc pushed to work exclusively with MC2,\" Yudashkin added, \u201cand potentially with The Identity in the future.\u201d\n\nBrunel, according to Yudashkin, wanted to open a new agency in America.\n\n\u201cHe had told me that he\u2019s not happy how MC2 is doing and saw that the image was a problem and he wanted to open a new agency,\u201d Yudashkin said. \u201cHe wanted to name it The Identity and Mathias was supposed to be the person who runs it.\u201d\n\nYudashkin said MC2 was supposed to be the agency for more commercial modeling jobs, while The Identity's goal was to become a high fashion agency.\n\nIn 2017, Yudashkin left 1 Mother Agency because he felt \u201cit was impossible to work with\u201d Brunel.\n\n\u201cI was in the position to lie to models about MC2 and it was intolerable for me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c When the time came to place the models in the U.S., Jean-Luc pushed to work exclusively with MC2, and potentially with The Identity in the future. \u201d \u2014 Vladimir Yudashkin, formerly of 1 Mother\n\nIn February, Ukranian model Natalia Kulakovskaya filed a lawsuit against 1 Mother and MC2, alleging that \u201cMother breached its fiduciary duty\u201d by \u201cforcing\u201d her to work with MC2. The complaint, filed in Miami-Dade County, alleges \u201cMother and MC2 share common control and/or ownership\u201d and that \u201cit was self-serving and profitable for Mother to work with Mother\u2019s affiliate.\u201d\n\nMartinez filed a motion to bring the case to arbitration. Kulakovskaya\u2019s lawyer, Nicolas Cuetara, said he will not comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe Ukrainian agency sued another model, Daria Khlystun, in November 2017, claiming that she breached her contract by failing to pay 1 Mother commission from her earnings with other agencies.\n\nIn her answer and counterclaim to 1 Mother\u2019s complaint, Khlystun denied violating her contract and instead claimed it wasn\u2019t valid because of \u201cduress/undue influence\u201d and \u201cfraud and/or misrepresentation\u201d by the agency, among other alleged transgressions.\n\nKhlystun claims she suffered damages because 1 Mother Agency failed to provide financial support, visas for travel, and housing\u2014and didn't allow her \u201cto select the agency, or model manager, of her choosing.\u201d\n\nShe alleged 1 Mother \u201cabused its influence to force\u201d her to work with agencies that weren\u2019t in her \u201cbest interest,\" according to one November 2018 court filing.\n\nOne of those agencies was MC2, which she claims is \"affiliated\" with 1 Mother.\n\nKhlystun\u2019s lawyer, Cuetara, filed a notice of service of a proposed settlement in February.\n\nMartinez did not return messages seeking comment on the 1 Mother lawsuits.", "description": "As French investigators hunt for Jean-Luc Brunel, and as his MC2 agency sells off assets, former employees and models say he\u2019s linked to new agencies in New York City and Ukraine.", "authors": ["Kate Briquelet", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569897597/190930-briquelet-Jean-Luc-Brunel-tease_un9ede", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
