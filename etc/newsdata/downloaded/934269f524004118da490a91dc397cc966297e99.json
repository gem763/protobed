This puts Phorpiex in the category of medium-sized malware botnets.\n\nThe Phorpiex trojan was first seen more than a decade ago. In its early days, the malware worked as a worm that self-propagated via removable USB storage devices, Skype, or Windows Live Messenger private messages.\n\nThese initial worm-based variants were tracked under the name of Phorpiex. Nowadays, the botnet is more often referred to as Trik (not to be confused with a different botnet known as The_Trick).\n\nThis new name came after the Phorpiex authors forked and integrated the codebase of the older SDBot trojan into the Trik/Phorpiex versions we see today.\n\nEven since its early days, the Phorpiex gang has always used infected computers to send email spam, rather than steal data from infected hosts, or deploy second-stage malware as part of a rentable pay-per-install malware-as-a-service operation.\n\nFor most of its lifetime, Phorpiex was a small player, compared to other spam botnets. This changed in May 2018 when the retooled Phorpiex version became a major player on the spam scene, according to a Proofpoint report published at the time.\n\nHistorically, the Phorpiex spam bots have been seen pushing almost all major malware variants, from banking trojans to ransomware, and from infostealers to shady pharmaceutical product spam.\n\nIn hindsight, Phorpiex getting involved in the recent trend of sextortion email spam campaigns isn't really a surprise, since it's right up their alley and area of expertise.\n\nPhorpiex scared users by showing one of their passwords\n\nAnd the most interesting part of Phorpiex's recent sextortion email campaigns is that the sextortion emails didn't just claim they had sexual videos of the victim, but they also claimed to have one of the victim's passwords.\n\nImage: Check Point (supplied)\n\nBukhteyev told ZDNet that while analyzing the veridity of these claims he discovered that all the email addresses used in the sextortion campaigns were also present in the Have I Been Pwned database.\n\nThe researcher suggests the email+password combos most likely came from past data breaches at various companies, data that made it into the public domain, and eventually into the Phorpiex gang's hands.\n\n\"However, it doesn't mean that they don't use other databases,\" Bukhteyev told ZDNet.\n\nOf note is that in June 2018, the Phorpiex botnet suffered a data breach itself when the Phorpiex operators forgot to secure one of their command and control servers, leaking a database of more than 43 million email addresses they were using to spam users.", "description": "Sextortion emails look silly for the most of us, but there are many users who take them at face value and pay up.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/17/2b29f76a-a335-4062-a367-27ba7ba638ef/thumbnail/770x578/60307c993fd399d4a659b4e7fc968bf7/internet-cash.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
