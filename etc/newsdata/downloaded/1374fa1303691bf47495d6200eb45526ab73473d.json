REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov\n\nA week after reversing U.S. policy and moving troops out of the way to allow Turkey to attack Washington\u2019s allies in northern Syria, Trump announced a package of sanctions to punish Turkey.\n\nBut financial markets shrugged off the announcement, and Trump\u2019s critics said the moves were too feeble to have an impact. The Turkish lira actually went up, with traders noting Trump had spared Turkish banks from punishment.\n\nTrump\u2019s unexpected decision to withhold protection from Syria\u2019s Kurds after a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan a week ago swiftly upended five years of U.S. policy in the Middle East, giving a free hand to Washington\u2019s adversaries in the world\u2019s deadliest ongoing war.\n\nThe United States announced on Sunday it was withdrawing its entire force of 1,000 troops. Its former Kurdish allies immediately forged a new alliance with the Russia-backed Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, inviting the army into towns across the breadth of Kurdish-held territory.\n\nTROOPS ENTER MANBIJ\n\nOne of the most important flashpoints is the city of Manbij, west of the Euphrates river, which Turkey has vowed to capture. The area had been patrolled jointly by U.S. and Turkish forces under a deal aiming to persuade Turkey not to invade.\n\nThe Russian-backed Syrian forces appear to have moved swiftly to fill the void left by departing Americans. State television broadcast footage of what it said was government troops entering the city on Tuesday. A resident inside the city told Reuters the Syrian troops were on its outskirts.\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian fighters said they would continue their advance towards Manbij, and said the troops that had entered were mostly Kurdish fighters now allied to the government.\n\nA Reuters cameraman on the Turkish frontier reported heavy bombardment on Tuesday morning of the Syrian border town of Ras al Ain, where a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces reported a fierce battle was taking place.\n\nSANCTIONS ANNOUNCEMENT \u201cFALLS VERY SHORT\u201d\n\nTrump has defended his reversal of U.S. policy as part of a plan to withdraw the United States from \u201cendless\u201d wars in the Middle East. But his critics, including senior figures in his own Republican Party, cast it as a betrayal of the Kurds, loyal allies who lost thousands of fighters in battle against Islamic State with Washington\u2019s support.\n\nThe Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said Trump\u2019s sanctions were too little, too late.\n\n\u201cHis announcement of a package of sanctions against Turkey falls very short of reversing that humanitarian disaster.\u201d\n\nTurkey says it aims to defeat the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as terrorists for its links to separatists in Turkey, and to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d where millions of Syrian refugees can be resettled.\n\nThe United Nations says 160,000 people have fled their homes as Turkish forces advance. The Kurdish administration puts the number of displaced at 270,000.\n\nErdogan, who has pledged to continue military operations come what may, said Turkey was giving the world a \u201csecond chance\u201d to bring peace to the region.\n\n\u201cThe international community missed its opportunity to prevent the Syrian crisis from pulling an entire region into a maelstrom of instability,\u201d he wrote in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe European Union - and the world - should support what Turkey is trying to do.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian army deployments into Kurdish-held territory are a victory for President Bashar al-Assad and his most powerful ally, Russia, giving them a foothold in the biggest remaining swath of the country that had been beyond their grasp.\n\nTrump allies insisted Washington had not given its blessing to the Turkish offensive and demanded a ceasefire.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America simply is not going to tolerate Turkey\u2019s invasion in Syria any further,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said. \u201cWe are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s sanctions include reimposing steel tariffs and halting talks on a $100 billion trade deal.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nBut the decision not to hit Turkish banks led to a rally in Turkish financial stocks: \u201cThe sanctions are not related to banking, so the markets will have a positive perception,\u201d said Cem Tozge, asset management director at Ata Invest.\n\nIn a potentially more damaging blow, German carmaker Volkswagen said it was postponing a final decision on whether to build a 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) plant in Turkey, citing concern over \u201ccurrent developments\u201d after international condemnation of the incursion.\n\nTrump said U.S. troops would remain at a small garrison at Tanf in southern Syria \u201cto continue to disrupt remnants\u201d of Islamic State. But the base would do little to support operations elsewhere in the country.", "description": "Turkey ignored new sanctions from the United States to press on with its assault on northern Syria on Tuesday, while the Russia-backed Syrian army entered one of the most hotly contested cities, filling a void created by Donald Trump's abrupt retreat.", "authors": ["Ece Toksabay", "Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441062142&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0NO", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
