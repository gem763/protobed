Amy Klobuchar looked to set herself apart from other Democrats running for office on Monday by telling voters here in New Hampshire that she judges gun control bills by whether they would \u201churt my Uncle Dick in the deer stand.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar, in an answer that found her touting her ties to rural Minnesota, grew emotional as she reflected on the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut and the fact that the Senate couldn\u2019t pass a gun control bill after the massacre.\n\n\u201cLike New Hampshire, Minnesota is a state that values the outdoors. We value hunting and fishing. And so I come at it from a little different place than some of my colleagues running for this office,\u201d she said, adding that she doesn\u2019t believe \u201cbanning assault weapons\u201d and \u201ccommon sense background checks\u201d hurt her uncle in the deer stand.\n\nKlobuchar choked up when she remembered working with the parents of children killed in Sandy Hook, especially when she had to tell them that a bill proposed by West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin and Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey would not pass the Senate in the wake of the shooting.\n\n\u201cI remember one of the moms telling me, \u2019You know what? We know this wouldn\u2019t have saved our babies, but it would have reduced domestic homicides, it would have reduced suicides and that\u2019s why we are here,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\nShe added: \u201cThose parents had the courage to come to Washington to advocate for something that wouldn\u2019t save their babies. We should join the majority of Americans and actually many gun owners in having the courage to pass common sense gun safety legislation.\u201d", "description": "Democratic Sen.
