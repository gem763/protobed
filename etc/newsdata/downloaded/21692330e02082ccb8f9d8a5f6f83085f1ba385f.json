We need your (citizens') view,\" Zaev said.\n\nParliament has to approve any snap election, but Zaev's center-left coalition has a majority and the opposition also backs an early poll. Zaev said party leaders would discuss the issue on Sunday evening with President Stevo Pendarovski.\n\nAfter Skopje agreed to end a dispute with Greece over the country's name - changing it to North Macedonia from Macedonia - the former Yugoslav republic had expected to be granted a date to start entry talks with the EU.\n\n\"A great injustice was inflicted on us. The EU did not deliver on its promise,\" Zaev said. \"We discharged all our obligations, we delivered results in our reforms, we solved the issues with our neighbors.\"\n\nThe West has long seen the integration of the western Balkan states into NATO and the EU as a way to stabilize the region following the ethnic wars of the 1990s that destroyed the old Yugoslavia.\n\nAs well as North Macedonia and Albania, four other countries - Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia - also aspire to join the EU, but the enlargement process has largely stalled amid increased public concerns in western Europe about immigration and the strains of dealing with Britain's exit from the bloc.\n\nNorth Macedonia is expected to become the 30th member of NATO later this year or early in 2020, once its accession has been ratified by all member states of the U.S.-led alliance.", "description": "North Macedonian PM urges snap election after EU declines to launch accession talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9I0A3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
