Supporters can find a decal for any club they follow, including Leeds (left) and Chelsea (right)\n\nMotorists even need to declare to their provider if they have fitted their vehicle with winter tyres, even though they make them safer during the colder months\n\nThis is because there are two definitions for 'modifications' used by providers.\n\nSome consider that a car has been modified if it has been 'changed in any way since it was first supplied by the vehicle manufacturer', while others can deem a motor has been modified if it has any optional extras that 'improve its value, performance, appearance or attractiveness to thieves'.\n\nIf your provider uses the second variation, it means any extra features - from improved sound systems to panoramic sunroofs - should be shared with the insurer.\n\nAgeas insurance is one of the providers that uses this latter definition of a modification, with chief underwriting officer Adam Clarke telling Auto Express: 'Optional extras are actually modifications \u2013 so to fully cover your vehicle make sure you declare these features.'\n\nHe also warned second-hand car buyers to make a note of extra kit that was added to the car from new so they can make their insurance provider aware.\n\nSome modifications have little to no impact on car valuations, such as tow bars to pull caravans and trailers\n\nRoof racks are also unlikely to increase premiums, though roof boxes can be seen as an easy target for criminals and may impact insurance costs\n\nHowever, despite this requirement for motorists to be pedantic about the details regarding their car's specification and additions, there are some alternations that will have almost no impact on premiums.\n\nThis includes the addition of tow bars, locking wheel nuts and roof racks, which are seen as less desirable changes.\n\nThat said, the latter is dependent on what's fitted to the rack, with the addition of bicycles or a roof box seen as an easy target for criminals and therefore could result in higher premiums.\n\nStill, BIBA says it is 'prudent' that vehicle owners tell their insurers that they have any extra features installed on their cars.\n\nThe insurance association said that all 'obvious' modifications that are not disclosed to providers could result in the policy being voided as the law states that owners must 'take reasonable care' not to misrepresent their car.\n\nTo show what impact modifications can have on premiums, Auto Express used a comparison site to see which features had the biggest impact on quotes.\n\nThe model used was a Ford Focus ST Line owned by a 37-year-old living in Hampshire.\n\nHow vehicle modifications can impact motor premiums Using Auto Express' Ford Focus example, here's how modifications impacted insurance quotes: The cheapest premium for the vehicle as standard was \u00a3467. Here's how much it increased when modifications were added: Auto Express used the example of a Ford Focus ST Line (pictured) to show what impact modifications could have on insurance premiums Standard car: \u00a3467 Aftermarket alloys: \u00a3490 (+4.93%) Increased performance badging: \u00a3504 (+7.92%) Uprated brakes: \u00a3510 (9.21%) Aftermarket sat-nav: \u00a3518 (+10.92%) Decals/stickers: \u00a3541 (+15.95%) Chipped engine management (ECU): \u00a3553 (+18.42%) Upgraded suspension: \u00a3553 (+18.42%) Roof spoiler: \u00a3554 (+18.63%) Nitrous oxide (NOS) kit: \u00a31,296 (+177.52%) Additional turbocharger: \u00a31,296 (+177.52%) Source: Auto Express using a Ford Focus ST Line owned by a 37-year-old male living in Hampshire\n\nAdding aftermarket alloy wheels saw motor insurance quotes rise by almost five per cent while fitting performance badges - such as Ford's RS, BMW's M-Sport or Mercedes' AMG logos - would result in a near eight per cent jump in premiums.\n\nAt the higher end of the spectrum, the declaration of a the car having an extra turbocharger installed or the engine modified to run nitrous oxide saw quotes soar by nearly 178 per cent.\n\nHugo Griffiths, Auto Express consumer editor, said: 'While some additions to your car are obvious candidates for telling your insurer about, many motorists will be surprised by the strict definition of modification, and how even a sticker in the back window could void your policy.\n\n'Failing to declare something as humble as paint protection film or different alloy wheels could void a policy entirely, potentially costing thousands in the event of an incident, and even putting motorists at risk of a \u00a3300 fine and six penalty points.\n\n'And, in the case of potentially controversial messages on stickers, it's best to keep your opinions to yourself, or be prepared to share them with your insurer.'\n\nMotorists need to inform finance providers about mods, too\n\nAs well as informing insurers, motorists who have cars that are on personal contract purchase (PCP) deal also need to make their finance providers aware of any modifications as these impact the value of the vehicle.\n\nWith PCP monthly payments based on depreciation, the finance provider will want to know if you've made any changes that might make the motor less valuable when it's time to hand it back.\n\nEngine modifications to a vehicle on finance are expressly forbidden in the terms and conditions, especially if the parts used are not manufacturer approved components.\n\nEarlier this year, This is Money reported that a YouTuber who had added a raft of performance upgrades to his BMW M4 had been informed he would need to purchase the \u00a360,000-plus motor outright or have it repossessed as he had breached the terms of the finance agreement by making modifications that put increased stress on the drivetrain.\n\nThis not only invalidated the finance deal but also the manufacturer's warranty on the machine.\n\nThose who have cars on lease schemes are usually informed not to make any alterations to their vehicles whatsoever.", "description": "The study identified which modifications to a vehicle would increase motor insurance premiums most, from changing the wheels to significant performance upgrades.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
