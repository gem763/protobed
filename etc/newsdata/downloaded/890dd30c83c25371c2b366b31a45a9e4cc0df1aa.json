Yet Sen. Elizabeth Warren was targeted mostly over old disagreements -- with fireworks that illuminated familiar ground, or that created what Sen. Cory Booker called \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, took no criticism from his rivals over the issues involving his son that have dominated the news in the month since the last debate, and virtually no attacks on matters of policy.\n\nThe Democratic candidates shredded President Donald Trump on foreign policy and whether he should be impeached. But they mainly fell back to sparring among themselves over narrow policy disagreements.\n\nAs she was at previous debates and in numerous interviews, Warren was pressed on whether taxes will go up on middle-class families under her Medicare-for-all plan. She ducked a direct answer by saying her plan would, on the whole, \u201clower costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\n(MORE: Elizabeth Warren: Everything you need to know about the 2020 presidential candidate)\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg saw an opening: \u201cWe heard it tonight: A yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar also got in on the action: \u201cYou are making Republican talking points, right here in this room,\u201d she told Warren.\n\nAnd Biden piled on: \u201cThe plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more, on a yearly basis, than the entire federal budget.\u201d\n\nThat issue was among those that reveal the ideological and attitudinal splits that continue to define the campaign. Some of the disagreements seemed a bit forced; Sen. Kamala Harris spent a few minutes picking a fight with Warren about whether Trump should have his Twitter account suspended.\n\nPHOTO: Supporters of resident Donald Trump and Sen.

Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,\u201d she said, in a reference to businessman Tom Steyer, who was appearing at his first debate. \u201cSimply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke criticized Warren for not putting out a more specific tax plan: \u201cI think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.\u201d\n\nBooker chimed in to say that those sorts of attacks will hurt the Democratic Party: \u201cTearing each other down because we have a different plan to me is unacceptable. I have seen this script before. It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020.\u201d\n\n(MORE: 5 key takeaways from the 4th Democratic debate)\n\nThe debate also showcased a sharp disagreement between O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg \u2013 two candidates vying for a similar swath of voters - on guns. O\u2019Rourke accused Buttigieg of excessive caution in avoiding a mandatory buyback of assault-style guns.\n\n\u201cLet's decide what we are going to believe in, and what we\u2019re going to achieve,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nButtigieg shot back: \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the polls, the problem is the policy. And I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d\n\nPHOTO: Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen.
