Etienne had 127 yards on 17 carries. The Tigers amassed 552 yards, the third time this year Clemson has topped 500 yards.\n\nClemson held the Seminoles to 253 total yards and 10 first downs.\n\nFlorida State running back Cam Akers, who entered the game second in the ACC in rushing with an average of 116.4 yards per game, had 34 yards on nine carries.\n\nClemson added two touchdowns in the third quarter -- a 29-yard run by wide receiver Amari Rodgers and a 38-yard interception return by Derion Kendrick, before Florida State finally got on the scoreboard when quarterback Alex Hornibrook connected with wide receiver Tamorrion Terry for a 64-yard touchdown with 2:02 left in the third quarter.\n\nClemson's Steven Sawicki converted the first field goal of his career, a 26-yarder early in the fourth quarter. Florida State running back Khalon Laborn, who paced the Seminoles with 69 yards on eight attempts, added a 40-yard touchdown run with 2:41 remaining.\n\nJames Blackman started at quarterback for Florida State, and he and Hornibrook were a combined 17 of 35 for 150 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Quarterback Trevor Lawrence passed for 170 yards and three touchdowns and ran  for a fourth as No. 2 Clemson jumped out to a 28-0 halftime lead and cruised ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
