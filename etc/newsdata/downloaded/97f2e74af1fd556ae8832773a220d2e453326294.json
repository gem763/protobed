General Assembly And All Other Foreign Travel\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pedro Martin Gonzalez Castillo/Getty Images Pedro Martin Gonzalez Castillo/Getty Images\n\nAs leaders from around the world spent Monday at the United Nations Climate Action Summit pledging to ban coal and cut carbon emissions, Mexico's president was at his weekday news conference showing off a new app that tells consumers where the cheapest gas in the country can be found.\n\nAnd it's not just Monday's events in New York. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is skipping the annual United Nations General Assembly altogether.\n\nIn fact, since taking office last December, L\u00f3pez Obrador hasn't left Mexico, not once. He didn't attend the Group of 20 summit of world leaders in Osaka, Japan, this past June. And he has met only with foreign dignitaries who travel to Mexico, greatly limiting his international exposure.\n\n\"For him not to travel leaves us missing a lot of international opportunities,\" says Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, the director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego. Fern\u00e1ndez was a foreign policy adviser to former President Felipe Calder\u00f3n.\n\n\"He's losing opportunities because leaders talk to leaders, not to someone sent to talk to them. It's not the same,\" adds Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\nAs with the G-20 summit, L\u00f3pez Obrador has dispatched his foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, in his place to the United Nations this week. When announcing his decision not to go to New York, the president expressed his full confidence in Ebrard, saying that Mexico is well represented.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador says his domestic agenda \u2014 cracking down on Mexico's rampant corruption, increasing social spending and bringing much-needed development to the country's poor \u2014 is more important than foreign concerns. When asked about his lack of international travel, L\u00f3pez Obrador often repeats the phrase \"The best foreign policy is domestic policy.\"\n\nPresidential spokesman Jesus Cantu says it's not a set-in-stone policy that L\u00f3pez Obrador won't travel outside the country. \"But he has decided that this first year he is dedicated to building the bases necessary at home,\" says Cantu.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has yet to travel to the U.S. to personally meet with President Trump. The two leaders have held several phone calls. And L\u00f3pez Obrador has met with the leaders of only a few neighboring Central American countries. All encounters were held in southern Mexican states.\n\n\"This is new for Mexico. Normally you'll see at least 10 visits to Mexico by foreign dignitaries in the first year of a government,\" says Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a foreign minister in former President Vicente Fox's administration. \"Over a whole administration, this means fewer businessmen come, foreign press, tourism officials. We hurt our good image in the world,\" he says.\n\nCasta\u00f1eda, a vocal critic of L\u00f3pez Obrador, believes the Mexican president is uncomfortable in international settings because he does not speak English and, more importantly, because he lacks a foreign policy.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has taken on a noninterventionist stance when it comes to hemispheric issues such as the political crises in Nicaragua and Venezuela, putting him at odds with the U.S. and other regional leaders. He has pushed for billions of dollars of foreign investment in Central America to provide jobs and security to stem the flow of migrants from the region. But that may be tough to do given his aversion to international settings, say critics. Among his most notable foreign policy decisions is his acquiescence to Trump's demands for more Mexican border enforcement to avoid tariffs and other punitive actions by the United States.\n\nCantu says the president will travel outside the country when necessary to sign a negotiated agreement or a concrete plan. But L\u00f3pez Obrador likes to say he won't engage in political tourism and often criticizes past administration's extravagant international travel on the taxpayers' dime.\n\nHe pledged government austerity on the campaign trail, and one of the first moves he made after taking office was to put the presidential plane up for sale, citing its exorbitant price tag. He flies commercial around the country and this summer mandated that all international travel requests be personally approved by him. He also cut the daily government travel per diem in half to $225 a day.\n\nThat approach could make Foreign Minister Ebrard's trip to New York even more challenging: good luck finding a hotel room, meals and taxis for that amount for one week in Manhattan.", "description": "Since taking office last December, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has not left the country.
