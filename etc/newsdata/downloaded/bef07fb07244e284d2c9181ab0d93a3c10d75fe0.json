REUTERS/Ognen Teofilovski\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Friday led a group of leaders who blocked opening talks with Albania and North Macedonia, despite concerns over increasing Chinese and Russian influence in the Balkans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed and angry and I know our people feel the same,\u201d Zaev told a news conference, calling the decision not to open entry talks a \u201chistoric mistake\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no time to lose and that is why my suggestion is to organize fast early parliamentary elections. We need your (citizens\u2019) view,\u201d Zaev said.\n\nParliament has to approve any snap election, but Zaev\u2019s center-left coalition has a majority and the opposition also backs an early poll. Zaev said party leaders would discuss the issue on Sunday evening with President Stevo Pendarovski.\n\nAfter Skopje agreed to end a dispute with Greece over the country\u2019s name - changing it to North Macedonia from Macedonia - the former Yugoslav republic had expected to be granted a date to start entry talks with the EU.\n\n\u201cA great injustice was inflicted on us. The EU did not deliver on its promise,\u201d Zaev said. \u201cWe discharged all our obligations, we delivered results in our reforms, we solved the issues with our neighbors.\u201d\n\nThe West has long seen the integration of the western Balkan states into NATO and the EU as a way to stabilize the region following the ethnic wars of the 1990s that destroyed the old Yugoslavia.\n\nAs well as North Macedonia and Albania, four other countries - Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia - also aspire to join the EU, but the enlargement process has largely stalled amid increased public concerns in western Europe about immigration and the strains of dealing with Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc.\n\nNorth Macedonia is expected to become the 30th member of NATO later this year or early in 2020, once its accession has been ratified by all member states of the U.S.-led alliance.", "description": "North Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev called on Saturday for a snap parliamentary election after the European Union failed to give his country a date to start talks on joining the bloc.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442650960&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0A3", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
