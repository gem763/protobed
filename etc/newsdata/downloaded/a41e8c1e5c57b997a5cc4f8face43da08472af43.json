The respondent\u2019s conduct does not qualify as hate speech,\u201d ruled Judge Daisy Molefe on Thursday.\n\nMolefe said journalists were not implicitly guarded against hatred by the law \u2013 it\u2019s not like your skin colour or ethnicity, which a person has no control over.\n\nGetting into journalism \u201cis a choice\u201d and therefore the same protections provided for under Section 16 of the Constitution do not apply as they would to other hate speech cases.\n\nThe application was dismissed and no cost order was granted to the complainants.\n\nMolefe said journalists were not implicitly guarded against hatred by the law \u2013 it\u2019s not like your skin colour or ethnicity, which a person has no control over.\n\nSanef and the journalists \u2013 in their founding affidavit \u2013 contended that the conduct of the EFF constituted hate speech as defined in section 10 of the Equality Act and in turn breached section 10 and 11 of the Act.\n\n\n\nThey also argued that the EFF was in violation of Section 16 of the Constitution in the process.\n\nThe EFF submitted that Sanef and the journalists failed to establish the hate speech claim and the harassment claim and urged the court not to \u201cwaste its time\u201d, saying the case should be dismissed with no costs order.\n\nRead: Sanef hits back at Malema\u2019s \u2018dangerous remarks\u2019\n\nThe EFF, in a statement on Thursday, said that it welcomed the judgement and reiterated that journalists who take sides should \u201cnever be regarded as professionals\u201d.\n\n\u201cJournalists who take sides, using journalism as a platform to pursue propaganda interest of politicians, must never be regarded as journalists,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe utterances that sparked the application stemmed from EFF leader Julius Malema\u2019s speech outside the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture last year when he called on his followers to deal decisively with certain reporters who he accused of defending \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d.\n\nThe journalists said they were subjected to intimidation, harassment and death threats, and that Malema did not condemn the comments.\n\nAdvocate Molefe said journalists were not implicitly guarded against hatred by the law \u2013 it\u2019s not like your skin colour or ethnicity, which a person has no control over. SC for the EFF previously told the court that \u201ctrolls from faceless and nameless Twitter accounts were harassing the Red Berets just as much as they were anyone else: Sanef was adamant that Malema was inciting violence and ill-sentiment towards some of their members online.\n\nKate Skinner, Sanef executive director, said the organisation accepted the decision and promised to respond once the full verdict was shared.\n\n\n\n\u201cSanef has noted the judgment by Judge Daisy Molefe of the Equality Court, dismissing Sanef\u2019s case that harmful and hateful statements made by EFF leader Julius Malema, his colleagues and supporters against journalists constitute hate speech and harassment,\u201d said Skinner in the statement.\n\n\u201cSanef is disappointed that the ruling was not in our favour, but maintains we were fully justified to have approached the courts after numerous instances of threats and intimidation were issued by the EFF against journalists. We also wish to emphasise that the recourse to the courts was a last resort after efforts to meet the EFF failed,\u201d said Skinner.", "description": "The Equality Court has ruled against the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) and five journalists in an application to interdict the EFF from intimidating, harassing and assaulting journalists.", "authors": ["Mandisa Nyathi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9198/8eaaec8067274a149106916a2ded004a.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
