One of the most fiercely debated films at the Toronto Film Festival last week was New Zealand actor-director Taika Waititi\u2019s satirical new comedy JoJo Rabbit. It is about a nervous young boy in the Hitler Youth in late wartime Germany who negotiates his way through life with the aid of an imaginary friend, none other than the Fuhrer himself (played by Waititi). This is the Third Reich used for a coming-of-age story, a Nazi movie with the flavour of The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13\u00be.\n\nScarlett Johansson plays the boy\u2019s mum. While Hitler advocates genocide, she is hiding a young Jewish girl to keep her out of the Nazis\u2019 hands.\n\nUnderstandably, the film (which receives its UK premiere at the London Film Festival next month) has split opinion. At a pre-festival press briefing, LFF artistic director Tricia Tuttle described it as \u201creally funny and moving ... a satire about challenging hate\u201d and as \u201cterrific filmmaking\u201d. Director-star Waititi called it \u201ca love letter to mothers\u201d. In his Toronto press conference, he justified the decision to make a heart-tugging family comedy set against the backcloth of Hitler, antisemitism and the Holocaust. \u201cWe have to keep remembering and keep finding new and inventive ways of telling the same story so children can listen and grow and move forward unified and with love in the future,\u201d Waititi said.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSome critics took extreme exception to his approach, calling it \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d and \u201cwrong-headed\u201d.\n\nRegardless of the strengths or weaknesses of JoJo Rabbit as storytelling, the film underlines the strange transformation in popular culture of Hitler. In cinema, in particular, he has become a universal symbol of comic-book evil, fantasy and (in the case of JoJo Rabbit at least) even whimsy. He now turns up in comedies, sci-fi films and musicals, as well as in earnest historical dramas and horror movies. The more he rages on screen, the more he seems like a Chaplinesque caricature of himself. It is becoming harder and harder for filmmakers to take the little man with the moustache seriously.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 27 films and TV shows that were forced to change their title Show all 27 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 27 films and TV shows that were forced to change their title 1/27 Annie Hall (1977) Original title: Anhedonia Anhedonia Annie Hall began life as Anhedonia, which is the scientific term for the inability to experience pleasure. But the title Annie Hall was eventually settled on, inspired by actress Diane Keaton's real name, Diane Hall, and her nickname, Annie. United Artists 2/27 Dynasty (1981-89) Original title: Oil Oil The hit series, which revolves around the family of an oil magnate, was originally supposed to be titled\u2026 wait for it\u2026 Oil. But it was then changed to Dynasty to compete with rival soap Dallas. CBS Television Distribution 3/27 Back to the Future (1985) Original title: Spaceman from Pluto Spaceman from Pluto Steven Spielberg genuinely thought the title Spaceman from Pluto was a joke suggestion, so it didn\u2019t last long, and was soon replaced by the now iconic name Back to the Future. He contacted the Universal Studios head Sid Sheinberg who had suggested the Pluto title, with a message thanking him for sending his wonderful \"joke\" name, saying the office \"got a kick out of it\". Ouch. Universal Pictures 4/27 The Breakfast Club (1985) Original title: The Lunch Bunch The Lunch Bunch The original script for this classic high-school movie went by the very naff name The Lunch Bunch, but thanks to the son of one of director John Hughes's friends, who had a school detention class called The Breakfast Club, the title was changed. Universal Pictures 5/27 Fatal Attraction (1987) Original title: Affairs of the Heart Affairs of the Heart The much friendlier sounding Affairs of the Heart wasn\u2019t a great match for the psychological thriller that brought us the bunny boiler, and after it received a poor reception from audiences, the film\u2019s title was changed to Fatal Attraction. Paramount Pictures 6/27 Licence to Kill (1989) Original title: Licence Revoked Licence Revoked This Bond film was, at one time, called Licence Revoked, but test audiences associated the title too much with driving, so thankfully it was changed to something far punchier. United Artists 7/27 Saved by the Bell (1989-93) Original title: Good Morning, Miss Bliss Good Morning, Miss Bliss NBC\u2019s Good Morning Miss Bliss centred on Hayley Mills as the eponymous teacher but, after the comedy briefly moved to the Disney Channel and then back to NBC, it was re-tooled to focus on the teenage students instead, therefore taking on a new name: Saved By The Bell. CBS Studios International 8/27 Goodfellas (1990) Original title: Wiseguy Wiseguy The Scorsese classic is an adaptation of a mobster novel called Wiseguy, which was originally also the title of the film, but the name had to be changed because it had already been taken for an 80s TV series. Warner Bros 9/27 Pretty Woman (1990) Original title: 3000 3000 Originally a dark drama about class and sex work, Pretty Woman\u2019s first title was 3,000 \u2013 the amount of money that Richard Gere's character Edward spends on a week of Vivian's (Julia Roberts) time. Disney changed the name as it came across as \u201ctoo science-fictiony\u201d, as well as the tone of the movie which was turned into a rom-com fairytale. Buena Vista Pictures 10/27 Friends (1994-2004) Original title: Six of One Six of One The beloved sitcom went through many different name changes, with all the following titles considered: Friends Like Us, Six of One, Across the Hall, Once Upon a Time in the West Village, and Insomnia Cafe. It\u2019s now hard to imagine the show becoming such a monumental hit with any of those names. Warner Bros Television Distribution 11/27 Pulp Fiction (1994) Original title: Black Mask Black Mask Pulp Fiction was initially inspired by the detective crime stories in the seminal magazine Black Mask, hence its first name. The publication was a pulp magazine, which goes some way to explaining the new title. Miramax Films 12/27 Titanic (1997) Original title: The Ship of Dreams The Ship of Dreams In a line from the classic 1997 film, the older version of Rose says: \"Titanic was called the ship of dreams, and it was, it really was.\" It was also the original title of the film, before the simpler name of Titanic was chosen. 20th Century Fox 13/27 That '70s Show (1998-2006) Original title: Teenage Wasteland Teenage Wasteland Early ideas for the 70s sitcom\u2019s name included Teenage Wasteland and The Kids Are Alright, but because the creators couldn\u2019t get song title rights from The Who, they were forced to change the name of the show. Carsey-Werner Distribution 14/27 American Pie (1999) Original title: Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate It was a bold move from screenwriter Adam Herz when he submitted his spec script to studios under the title Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But The Executive Will Hate. But the risk paid off, with the film, eventually named American Pie, grossing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worldwide. Universal Pictures 15/27 Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999) Original title: Dairy Queens Dairy Queens The black comedy was originally supposed to be called Dairy Queens. However, the company that owns fast food chain Dairy Queen apparently didn't love the idea of being associated with the movie, so they filed a lawsuit and, lo and behold, Drop Dead Gorgeous was born. New Line Cinema 16/27 8 Simple Rules (2002-03) Original title: 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter This family sitcom originally had a longer name, but when star John Ritter \u2013 who played the concerned father in the show \u2013 suddenly died after filming the third episode of the second series, the show changed its format and name to 8 Simple Rules and Ritter\u2019s death was written into the plot. Buena Vista International Television 17/27 Cars (2006) Original title: Route 66 Route 66 The animated hit was initially called Route 66 after the iconic road in America, but the title was changed to Cars to avoid confusion with a 60s TV show of the same name. Buena Vista Pictures 18/27 Hannah Montana (2006-11) Original title: Alexis Texas Alexis Texas Miley Cyrus\u2019s Disney comedy was originally called Alexis Texas but, because a porn actor shares the same name, it had to be changed in case children looked up the show\u2019s title and accidentally found pornography. Disney-ABC Domestic Television 19/27 The Big Bang Theory (2007-19) Original title: Lenny, Penny and Kenny Lenny, Penny and Kenny The Big Bang Theory\u2019s original rhyming title was forced to change after the character Kenny\u2019s name switched to Sheldon, who was then brought to life by Jim Parsons. Warner Bros Television Distribution 20/27 Samantha Who? (2007-09) Original title: Sam I Am Sam I Am Clearance issues with the estate of Dr Seuss led ABC to change the name of its Christina Applegate-led show, as the original title, Sam I Am, drew on the first lines of Dr Seuss\u2019s classic Green Eggs and Ham. Disney \u2013 ABC Domestic Television 21/27 The Good Wife (2009-16) Original title: Leave the Bastard Leave the Bastard The Good Wife\u2019s creators got a call from CBS pushing them to change the title just as it went into production. The network did actually consider Leave the Bastard, but ultimately decided to play it safe with The Good Wife. CBS Television Distribution 22/27 Shutter Island (2010) Original title: Ashecliffe Ashecliffe Ashecliffe, the name of the hospital in Martin Scorcese\u2019s thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was originally going to be the film\u2019s title before it was changed to Shutter Island. Paramount Pictures 23/27 New Girl (2011-18) Original title: Chicks and Dicks Chicks and Dicks New Girl was initially pitched as \"a young ensemble comedy about the sexual politics of men and women\u201d, hence its original, provocative title: Chicks and Dicks. Not only did this name attract the wrong kind of attention, but New Girl better reflected the content of the sitcom, which ended up revolving around Zooey Deschanel\u2019s Jess. 20th Television 24/27 Edge of Tomorrow (2014) Original title: All You Need Is Kill All You Need Is Kill The Tom Cruise action movie was originally known as All You Need Is Kill, the title of the book on which the movie is based, but filmmakers changed the title because they felt the word \"kill\" was too problematic. \"I think the word 'kill' in a title is very tricky in today's world\u2026\" producer Edwin Stoff said. \u201cWe see it enough in real newspaper headlines, and I don't think we need to see it when we're looking at a movie.\" After a lucklustre box office opening, the film's name was changed once again, in marketing and for home release, to Live, Die, Repeat. Warner Bros Pictures 25/27 Lovesick (2014-18) Original title: Scrotal Recall Scrotal Recall The relationship comedy drama starring Johnny Flynn was renamed after one series because, perhaps unsurprisingly, it was suffering from a lack of word of mouth, with people reluctant to say the word \u201cscrotal\u201d. Clerkenwell Films 26/27 Stranger Things (2016-) Original title: Montauk Montauk The original title of the Netflix hit was Montauk, as the plan had been for it to be set in a village of the same name in New York. However, when creators the Duffer brothers later relocated the show\u2019s action to the fictional town of Hawkins in Indiana, the name changed to Stranger Things. Intriguingly, Montauk also happens to be the title of a short film which the Duffer brothers were accused of plagiarising. Netflix 27/27 Arrival (2017) Original title: Story of Your Life Story of Your Life The sci-fi film starring Amy Adams originally went by the title of the novella it was based on, Story of Your Life, but because producer Shawn Levy thought it \"sounds a bit like a One Direction song\u201d and \"multiword titles can be really problematic\u201d, the movie changed its name to Arrival.

Paramount Pictures\n\nThe most nuanced screen portrayal of Hitler on screen in recent times was that of Bruno Ganz in Oliver Hirschbiegel\u2019s Downfall (2004), set in Berlin at the end of the Second World War. As The New Yorker put it, Ganz\u2019s portrayal made Hitler into \u201ca plausible human being\u201d. The film was successful and was nominated for an Oscar. Nonetheless it remains popular today primarily because it is so ripe for parody. Ganz\u2019s onscreen rants have been coopted countless times for YouTube spoofs. \u201cHitler interviews Justin Bieber\u201d, \u201cHitler finds out Arsene Wenger will leave Arsenal\u201d and \u201cHitler phones an Indian call centre\u201d are just some of the re-edited videos which milk Ganz\u2019s onscreen tantrums for comic effect. The Hitler played by Martin Wuttke in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Inglourious Basterds (2009) was in a similar mould, a man who drives himself into such paroxysms of rage that he looks as if he is about to have a stroke. It\u2019s a vaudeville turn in which Hitler\u2019s motivations are secondary. He is there to blow off as much steam as possible.\n\nFilmmakers have also recently shown a morbid obsession with imagining the alternative life Hitler might have led if he had survived the war and was somehow still around today. German box-office hit Look Who\u2019s Back (2015), directed by David Wnendt, imagined him waking up bedraggled on a park bench in Berlin-Mitte in 2014. As he emerges from his slumber, no one can take him seriously. He is treated not as the Great Dictator but as a lovable street comedian \u2013 just another eccentric in a society full of them. Everyone wants selfies with him. He thinks the world has gone mad and is appalled to see Angela Merkel \u2013 \u201ca clumsy woman with the charisma of wet noodle\u201d, as he calls her \u2013 leading the German people.\n\nLook Who\u2019s Back followed on from another German comedy a few years before, Dani Levy\u2019s Mein F\u00fchrer:The Truly Truest Truth About Adolf Hitler (2007), which portrayed the Fuhrer suffering from acute depression at the end of the war and summoning an old Jewish acting coach from a concentration camp to help him make an important speech. Reviewers raged against its lack of decent jokes and its \u201csympathetic\u201d portrayal of Hitler.\n\n\u201cThe taboo is not lifted. There\u2019s still a lot of resentment and a lot of fear. If you laugh about such destructive times, it feels as if you are making fun of the victims,\u201d Levy acknowledged in an interview to promote the film\u2019s release. It was an astute remark, which partly explained why German critics were so hostile to the film.\n\nBoth Levy and Wnendt were born long after the war and were chafing against restrictions imposed on them by their parents\u2019 generation. Nonetheless, their films felt very superficial. So did Menno Meyjes\u2019s Max (2002), in which Noah Taylor played the future dictator as a penniless artist and vagabond in post-war Munich. \u201cWhen people say I am humanising him, I don\u2019t think they mean that. They all know he wasn\u2019t born in a cloud of sulphur ... this guy was just a guy, just a frustrated guy. [The film] demystifies him. The Hitler myth has become so calcified, and it was important to break that open,\u201d said Meyjes in justification of his approach to telling the story of the young Hitler.\n\nThe danger was that in breaking the myth open, Meyjes and other filmmakers did indeed risk trivialising the apocalyptic suffering unleashed by their subject. The fact that he was \u201cjust a guy\u201d was neither here nor there. They were inviting audiences to empathise with him and even to feel sorry for him. By humanising him, they were distorting the traditional picture of him and, however obliquely, trying to explain and justify his behaviour. It was as if they were suggesting that Hitler, like Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s uber-villain in new film The Joker, wasn\u2019t fully to blame for his actions, that his background and life experiences turned him into the monster he became.\n\nSome films portraying Hitler have so many layers of irony to them that they can get away with ideas that might otherwise have seemed utterly tasteless. That was the case with Graham Rose\u2019s short Mrs Meitlemeihr (2002), set in bomb ravaged post-war London where Hitler (Udo Kier) tries to pass himself off as a housewife but struggles to escape the attentions of an amorous Jewish neighbour. Kier also played Hitler as a Tyrannosaurus-riding madman on the moon in Timo Vuorensola\u2019s sci-fi comedy Iron Sky: The Coming Race (2019).\n\nOf course, as many historians have pointed out, there was always a perverse comedy and pathos in Hitler\u2019s story. He really did look like Charlie Chaplin \u2013 and was born in the same week in the spring of 1889. His father had grown up as Alois Schicklgruber and only changed his surname in his mid-thirties. If his son had kept that name, his political ambitions may well have been stymied. \u201cI have heard Germans speculate whether Hitler could have become master of Germany had he been known to the world as Schicklgruber ... can you imagine the frenzied German masses acclaiming a Schicklgruber with their thunderous \u2018Heils\u2019?\u201d American journalist William L Shirer asks in his study, The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich.\n\nIn the early 1940s, filmmakers like Chaplin and Ernst Lubitsch picked up on Hitler\u2019s everyman/Schicklgruber quality and mocked him for it. However, at the time Chaplin was making The Great Dictator (1940), he had little knowledge of the full horrors of the Third Reich. As he later wrote in his autobiography, \u201chad I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made The Great Dictator, I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.\u201d Lubitsch\u2019s wondrously witty comedy To Be or Not to Be \u2013 which opens with Hitler seemingly on a shopping trip, looking for tasty morsels at Jewish delicatessens in downtown Warsaw in 1939 \u2013 was made in 1942, likewise before the full extent of the Nazi genocide was known.\n\nPeople\u2019s memories of the homicidal insanity are clearly receding into the distance if Hitler is now able to feature in films like JoJo Rabbit as the young hero\u2019s imaginary best friend.\n\nIt is often said that the best way to undermine dictators is to laugh at them. Once they are ridiculed by their own people, their power begins to seep away. That is why senior Nazis reacted so badly to being mocked. As Rudolph Herzog points out in his book Dead Funny: Humour in Hitler\u2019s Germany (2011), during the Third Reich, people were condemned to death for telling even the most anodyne jokes about Hitler. The flip side, though, is that using humour today in movies set during the Hitler era is to risk distracting audiences from the systematic violence and antisemitism that Hitler and his cronies oversaw. If filmmakers are going to give their young characters imaginary friends, maybe they should stick to giant rabbits like the one who took such good care of James Stewart in Harvey (1950) and leave the men in swastikas alone.\n\n\u2018JoJo Rabbit\u2019 screens at the London Film Festival on 5 October", "description": "Hitler is back on screen... again.
