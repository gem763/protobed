A Labour government will be on your side, while Boris Johnson's Conservatives - who think they're born to rule - will only look after the privileged few,\" Mr Corbyn said in a statement.\n\n\"We will launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change that our country has ever seen.\"\n\nMr Johnson will focus on bread-and-butter issues such as policing, schools and hospitals, where he's already pledged to crack open the public purse.\n\nHe'll also urge voters to back him on Brexit, blaming opposition MPs for frustrating \"the will of the people\" expressed at the 2016 referendum.\n\nPolls suggest Mr Johnson is in a better position than Mr Corbyn to emerge as leader of the largest party in the next parliament: the Conservative Party has a 10-point lead over Labour. Mr Corbyn is also the most unpopular opposition leader in British polling history.\n\nBut Mr Johnson will be fighting off the Liberal Democrats on the Conservatives' moderate flank and the Brexit Party on their muscular flank, making the outcome highly uncertain.\n\nHe's also likely to lose seats in Scotland, where popular Tory leader Ruth Davidson has stepped down. So he needs to make gains from Labour in Leave-voting towns in the Midlands and north of England.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's going to be a tough election, but we will do the best we can,\" Mr Johnson reportedly told journalists as he left a meeting of Conservative backbenchers after the vote - a curiously downbeat assessment by his standards.\n\nBritain's first-past-the-post voting system means that when smaller parties do well, the result in a given seat becomes much more uncertain. Seats could easily be won by the candidate who usually comes second, on as little as one-third of the vote, if the front-runner loses votes to a minor-party challenger.\n\nJohn Curtice, Britain's pre-eminent psephologist, said Mr Johnson could only win if he keeps Nigel Farage's Brexit Party at bay. Leading Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker said on Wednesday (AEDT) that there'd be no electoral pact with Mr Farage.\n\nThe anti-Brexit parties, such as the Greens and Plaid Cymru (the Welsh nationalists), may look to coordinate with the Liberal Democrats to avoid splitting the 'Remain' vote in winnable seats.\n\nMr Johnson earlier on Tuesday took the precautionary step of readmitting 10 of the 21 Conservative MPs who were expelled after they rebelled against his Brexit plans in previous parliamentary votes.\n\nHe said there might also be a way back for some of the others, as he looks to ward off the threat of excommunicated Tories running in their old seats and splitting the Conservative vote.\n\nAnother uncertainty lies in the volatility of the electorate: in the most recent election in 2017, 19 per cent of voters switched parties during the campaign. What's more, voting is not compulsory in Britain - so winter elections are usually avoided, as they risk depressing the turnout.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Corbyn proved himself an effective campaigner in 2017, turning a satisfaction rating of minus 41 at the outset into a rating of just minus 1 by the end. But he starts this campaign on minus 60.\n\nMr Johnson is a proven winner, having bagged the Mayor of London election twice in what is usually a Labour stronghold, and then fronted the 'Leave' campaign at the 2016 referendum.\n\nBut this will be a bigger test, and his campaign team will need to avoid the divisions and disputes that plagued Theresa May's campaign in 2017.\n\nIt's not year clear what role, if any, Lynton Crosby and his C|T Group will play in the campaign - although key Crosby operatives have taken jobs within the Conservative Party machine.", "description": "A dark and wintry pre-Christmas election is Britain's last, best hope of breaking the Brexit deadlock.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_52/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6df785ca3a2a53e8f5cd3d14f8da40f686718e4d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
