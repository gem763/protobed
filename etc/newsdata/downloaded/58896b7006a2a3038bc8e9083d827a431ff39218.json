It\u2019s one of three cases testing the definition of \u201csex\u201d under Title VII of the landmark Civil Rights Act.\n\nThough the legal question centers on civil rights rather than religious rights, how the court rules could significantly alter how Christian business owners manage their employees.\n\nLuke Goodrich, vice president at Becket, said the court should leave it up to lawmakers to pass legislation prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation, which has been done in 22 states plus the District of Columbia.\n\nHe said the justices should \u201ccreate space for the legislature to resolve this issue\u201d and give exemptions for religious organizations.\n\n\u201cA ruling that sex is limited to the biological categories of male and female \u2026 would increase calls for legislation like the Equality Act,\u201d he said, referring to legislation passed by House Democrats aimed at protecting the LGBT community from discrimination.\n\nThe second case already granted a hearing by the high court is brought by Christians hoping to maintain their children\u2019s private school education. The battle was brought against Montana after it withdrew religious schools from a school choice grant program.\n\nReligious liberty advocates say the disparate treatment runs afoul of the Constitution and resembles the high court\u2019s decision in a case in Missouri two years ago where the state provided grants for playground resurfacing to all institutions except those owned by churches.\n\nThe high court in a 7-2 decision said that violated the First Amendment\u2019s protection of the free exercise of religion.\n\n\u201cAs free citizens, we should be able to choose how \u2026 to use the money,\u201d said Mike Berry, chief of staff at the First Liberty Institute.\n\nThe faith defenders say citizens shouldn\u2019t be forced to speak in a way that violates their faith, which is one of the arguments presented in a petition for review from a Christian florist who refused to participate as a vendor in a same-sex wedding.\n\nThe state of Washington penalized Barronelle Stutzman for violating the state\u2019s public accommodations law. The Supreme Court sent her case back to the state\u2019s high court after siding in 2018 with a Christian baker, who had refused to create a cake for a same-sex wedding.\n\nIn the baker\u2019s case, the justices said the state\u2019s civil rights commission showed religious hostility toward the cake maker, but the high court punted on settling the First Amendment conflict.\n\nThe narrow ruling has left a series of cases in the lower courts unresolved, pitting LGBT rights against Christian-owned businesses.\n\nWashington\u2019s highest court again ruled against Ms. Stutzman, prompting her to seek Supreme Court review once again.\n\nBut Robert Tuttle, a law professor at George Washington University, said Ms. Stutzman\u2019s case does not involve any anti-religious animus, which had been present in the baker\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cIt is the furthest thing from a slam dunk,\u201d he said, noting he would be surprised if the justices take it up again.\n\nJosh Bursch, an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, disagreed, saying the fact the justices told the lower court to take another look at Ms. Stutzman\u2019s case suggests they would review its subsequent ruling.\n\n\u201cWhen you thumb your nose at the U.S. Supreme Court, that\u2019ll increase the likelihood they\u2019ll take it,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother highly watched case seeking review involves an independent contractor from Idaho who refused to provide the state with his Social Security number, saying that requirement violates his religious beliefs. Idaho, though, says it needs the digits to register him for a business license.\n\nReligious liberty advocates say the case gives the justices an opportunity to revisit a 1990 case in which the court ruled the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause doesn\u2019t necessarily require religious exemptions from generally applicable laws.\n\nMeanwhile, Catholic leaders have asked the justices to take a look at a number of legal battles.\n\nOne highly eyed appeal comes from Catholic Social Services against Philadelphia after the city stopped allowing same-sex couples to serve as foster parents.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan has a challenge pending before the justices that arose after Puerto Rico\u2019s highest court ruled Roman Catholic churches are a single entity responsible for nearly $5 million in pension obligation from three Catholic schools.\n\n\u201cAll of them have great potential,\u201d said Mike Berry, deputy general counsel for First Liberty Institute.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
