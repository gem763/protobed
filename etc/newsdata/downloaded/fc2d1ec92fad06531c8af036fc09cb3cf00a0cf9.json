If it activated for 10 seconds and pilots didn\u2019t react, it would prove \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d he added. That information should have prompted a more thorough review by the Federal Aviation Administration, he said.\n\n\u201cNow that was never clearly communicated to the FAA, as far as we can tell,\u201d DeFazio told reporters Monday in an interview. \u201cWas that intentional withholding or unintentional?\u201d\n\nMuilenburg is to appear before the Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday, and DeFazio\u2019s committee on Wednesday.\n\nSenator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and the committee\u2019s chairman, told reporters on Monday that he forsees a legislative response once the inquiries into the Max have been completed.\n\n\u201dI think there\u2019ll be some statutory fixes,\u201d Wicker said at the Capitol. He added that among the questions he had for Boeing were: \u201cis the plane ready to go, and then what mistakes were made and what\u2019s to prevent them from happening in the future.\u201d\n\nBoeing didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on DeFazio\u2019s comments. Muilenburg in his written testimony set to be delivered to the Senate panel said the company made mistakes and is learning lessons.\n\nThe company has said that the plane was designed and certified following all U.S. regulations.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alan Levin in Washington at alevin24@bloomberg.net;Steven T.
