I think the National Human Rights Commission and the U.N. high commissioner should be part of this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear there was excessive use of force,\u201d he added.\n\nThe defense ministry said in its statement on Wednesday that the military force had used force in accordance with the law.\n\nThe reputation of Mexico\u2019s armed forces was tainted by the 2014 mass shooting of 22 suspected gang members in the central municipality of Tlatlaya, which led to the arrest of seven soldiers suspected of carrying out extra-judicial killings.\n\nThree of the soldiers were subsequently charged with murder, although all of the suspects had been released by 2016.\n\nTepochica is on the outskirts of Iguala, a city notorious for the 2014 disappearances of 43 student teachers. The corporal killed on Tuesday was from Iguala\u2019s 27th Battalion, the defense minister said in a tweet, praising his heroism.\n\nSecurity forces again came under intense scrutiny in 2015 when a gunfight in the western state of Michoacan left 42 suspected gangsters dead for the loss of one federal policeman.\n\nPhotographs of the Tepochica shootout showed four men lying dead in the back of a pick-up, others on the ground behind the vehicle, and two dead youths, one of whom was holding a rifle, in the back of a car.\n\nStreets were silent and smeared with blood the day after the fight. Schools were closed. Several residents told Reuters they sheltered inside their houses when shooting started and had not witnessed the violence. They said that after about 40 minutes of gunfire, soldiers began knocking at doors and searching homes.\n\nThe bodies were taken to a local morgue, where they were identified by family members. Officials at the morgue said the men were from Tepochica, Iguala and neighboring towns.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International said in a statement that given the questions over the event, Mexico should conduct a prompt, independent and impartial investigation \u201cto determine whether the security forces made legal use of lethal force.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is evidence of human rights violations, the authorities should try those suspected of responsibility in a fair trial and guarantee their rights to due process,\u201d said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.", "description": "The mass killing in Mexico this week of 14 suspected gang members in a gunfight that claimed the life of one soldier has raised questions about whether the armed forces used excessive force, reviving the specter of notorious cases from the past.", "authors": ["Ana Isabel Martinez", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
