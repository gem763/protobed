U.S. Consumer Prices Trail Forecasts as Used-Car Costs Drop\n\n(Bloomberg) -- A key measure of U.S. consumer prices rose by less than expected in September as used-car costs fell by the most in a year, potentially bolstering the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the third time in three months.\n\nThe core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, increased 0.1% from the prior month, a Labor Department report showed Thursday, below the median estimate of economists. The annual gain of 2.4% matched projections as well as the August increase. The broader CPI was unchanged on the month and up 1.7% annually, trailing projections.\n\nThe subdued monthly reading could reinforce investor bets that the Fed will ease policy later in October as the global picture darkens and the trade war worsens. Officials favoring a reduction may see little risk that inflation will jump above the central bank\u2019s price goal and a danger that trade tensions will persist for some time.\n\nEven so, additional tariffs could still pass through to prices paid by consumers. On Sept. 1 President Donald Trump initiated fees on about $112 billion in Chinese products and the Asian nation immediately retaliated. Chinese and American negotiators are holding face-to-face talks in Washington this week, with levies set to rise further barring any truce.\n\nA separate Labor Department report Thursday showed filings for unemployment benefits fell to a three-week low of 210,000, indicating that while job gains are slowing, layoffs and firings remain limited.\n\nTreasury yields climbed to the day\u2019s highs after the data, and as traders prepared for a 30-year bond auction later Thursday.\n\nVehicle Prices\n\nThe weaker-than-expected CPI figures reflected a 1.6% monthly drop in used-car prices, while new vehicle costs fell 0.1% for the third straight decline. Apparel prices decreased 0.4%, the first drop since April.\n\nOther categories were firmer. Shelter, which makes up about a third of total CPI, rose 0.3% in September following a 0.2% gain. Owners-equivalent rent, one of the categories that tracks rental prices, increased 0.3%.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s CPI gauge tends to run faster than the Commerce Department\u2019s personal consumption expenditures price index, the measure officially targeted by the Fed for 2% inflation. Policy makers look to the core PCE index for a better read on underlying price trends. That measure has shown signs of firming, increasing 1.8% annually in August, the most since January.\n\nOn the CPI, energy prices fell 1.4% in September, the fourth drop in five months, as gasoline declined 2.4%. Food was up 0.1%, the first increase in four months.\n\nPrices for medical care rose 0.2%, the least since February, though components were mixed: physicians\u2019 services costs increased, hospital services were unchanged and prescription drugs fell 0.5%.\n\nHealth insurance prices rose 1.4% in September. In the prior month, the index for such costs surged by a record 1.9%, though it\u2019s not directly based on prices paid by consumers; instead, it\u2019s an indirect measure based on retained earnings, or what insurers have after paying out claims.\n\nGet More", "description": "U.S. Consumer Prices Trail Forecasts as Used-Car Costs Drop", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE6J0D0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
