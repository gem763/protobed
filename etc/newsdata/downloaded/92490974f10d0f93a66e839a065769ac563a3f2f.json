If he does, he will inherit a country mired in stagflation with an unsustainable debt burden that Fern\u00e1ndez will begin to renegotiate next week, all while adopting a foreign policy that will end Argentina\u2019s status as one of the United States\u2019 closest allies in Latin America.\n\nSix presidential tickets are contesting the October 27 election. But only two are relevant: The ticket of Fern\u00e1ndez and his vice-presidential nominee, former president (2007-15) Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, and the ticket of President Mauricio Macri and Senator Miguel Pichetto. Current projections suggest Fern\u00e1ndez will win between 48 percent and 53 percent of the vote and Macri between 32 percent and 37 percent.\n\nPresident-elect Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s immediate challenges will include an annual inflation rate above 50 percent, a peso that has lost more than 300 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar over the past 18 months and an economy that will shrink by 3 percent this year \u2014 all combined with a stubborn structural primary fiscal deficit and an unsustainable debt burden that includes more than $150 billion in debt payments (capital and interest) set to come due during Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s four-year term.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith debt payments in 2020 alone of more than $50 billion, one of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s first steps will be negotiating with creditors to restructure the country\u2019s debt. There is no question Fern\u00e1ndez will require creditors to agree to a rescheduling of debt payments, kicking them down the road to provide breathing room in 2020, and in 2021 when pivotal midterms will be held.\n\nBut many Fern\u00e1ndez advisors believe rescheduling alone will do little to clear the cloud of potential default floating over the country, which in turn will inhibit the foreign and domestic investment needed to spur economic growth. Creditors should therefore expect to be asked by Fern\u00e1ndez to write-down a non-trivial portion of their loans to Argentina in addition to the rescheduling.\n\nIf Fern\u00e1ndez does not get at least the minimum type of debt restructuring he feels he needs to avoid a severe economic crisis, he will have no qualms about defaulting, just as his predecessors have done over the past 40 years (e.g. in 2001 and 1982). Argentines have learned that while a default severely reduces the flow of international credit in the short to medium term, the credit spigot will eventually be opened back up.\n\nUnder President Macri (2015-19), Argentina has been a valuable U.S. ally, especially related to U.S. Latin American policy. This includes Argentina\u2019s strong support for democracy in Venezuela via membership in the Lima Group, active military and intelligence cooperation with the U.S. to combat drug-trafficking and terrorism in the hemisphere and respect for the rule of law and openness to U.S. investment in Argentina to help develop the world\u2019s second-largest shale gas reserves in the country\u2019s Vaca Muerta shale play.\n\nArgentine foreign policy will undergo a notable shift under President Fern\u00e1ndez. Argentina will withdraw from the Lima Group and adopt a \u201cneutral\u201d position vis-\u00e0-vis the Maduro dictatorship (which Fern\u00e1ndez has argued is not a dictatorship). Relations with the United States will become frostier, particularly as long as Donald Trump Donald John TrumpCharles Barkley: 'Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up' Democrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report Trump plans to appeal House subpoena for financial records to Supreme Court MORE is president, and Argentina will restore more robust and cordial ties with China and Russia.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTensions with Brazil, Argentina\u2019s largest trading partner, will increase, as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is no great fan of Fern\u00e1ndez and especially not of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. And the feeling is mutual, with Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner much more in sync politically and ideologically with the opposition Brazilian Workers\u2019 Party of the imprisoned (on corruption charges) Lula Da Silva.\n\nThe one area where Fern\u00e1ndez is least likely to alter course, at least in the short-term, is in policies affecting energy-related investment, since he recognizes the pivotal importance of the development of the Vaca Muerta to Argentina\u2019s economic future. As a consequence, Fern\u00e1ndez will do everything possible to maintain the flow of foreign investment needed to develop the Vaca Muerta, investment that will come largely from international oil companies based in the United States and Europe.\n\nA question presidential challengers often ask voters, is \u201cAre you better off than you were four years ago?\u201d Today the answer for a majority of Argentines is \u201cno.\u201d Macri\u2019s failure over the past four years to right the Argentine ship is yet another disappointment for a country that, while endowed with exceptional natural and human resources, has been enmeshed in a century-long economic decline that seems to know no end.\n\nGiven the economic challenges facing the country, Fern\u00e1ndez has his work cut out for him if he is going to restore growth and prosperity and thereby avoid a similar negative verdict from Argentine voters in 2023.\n\nMark P.
