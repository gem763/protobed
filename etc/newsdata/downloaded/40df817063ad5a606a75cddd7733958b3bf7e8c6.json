Wallin and Co Tin-Box factory, inside a stunning building developed in the 1820's.\n\nIt's also in a fantastic location close to both Borough and London Bridge Stations, a short walk from Borough Market, the River Thames and the City.\n\nBut it's not its location that's turning heads.\n\nThe American animation duo's London flat is decorated in their signature spooky style.\n\nThe identical twins Stephen and Timothy Quay, whose short films have been praised by the likes of Christopher Nolan, director of The Dark Knight, designed the one-bedroom flat in Borough to reflect their Halloween-esque style, as a retreat when they\u2019re in town.\n\nBut it could easily be mistaken for one of their film sets.\n\nThe property is set over the top two floors, with a cast iron spiral staircase taking you to the mezzanine level with the bedroom and bathroom area and access to a terrace.\n\nAnd it's so decorated, it resembles a haunted house with exposed beams, distressed walls and macabre d\u00e9cor.\n\nIt\u2019s weird, definitely wonderful, and on the market at \u00a31.15 million with Williams Lynch.\n\nInterested? The property is being sold with no onward chain.\n\nThe location is just a minute's walk from Bermondsey Street, Bankside, The Globe Theatre, Tate Modern and many more of London's major landmarks.\n\nThe Quay Brothers reside and work in England, having moved here in 1969 to study at the Royal College of Art, London after studying illustration and film at the Philadelphia College of Art, now the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.\n\nMost of their animation films feature puppets made from dolls and other organic and inorganic materials, often partially disassembled, in a dark, moody atmosphere.\n\nPerhaps their best known work is Street of Crocodiles (1986), based on the short novel of the same name by the Polish author and artist Bruno Schulz.\n\nThey also directed an animated sequence in the film Frida in 2002.", "description": "Just in time for October 31, celebrated American animation duo the Brothers Quay are selling their\u00a0London\u00a0flat", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20742066.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_a2390660c4fa0fc876c126cd1ba987ce8db1f795.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
