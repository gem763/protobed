REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe central bank is expected to lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point for the second time in three months, but a deep divide among policymakers has seen traders abandon all bets on a third reduction this year.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s policy statement is due at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) followed by Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s address a half hour later.\n\nRate-sensitive banks were little changed in premarket trading after the banking index .SPXBK closed 0.6% lower on Tuesday following an unexpected squeeze on short-term money market borrowing costs.\n\nCentral banks around the world have been taking steps to cushion the impact of a prolonged U.S.-China trade war and other geopolitical risks. Last week, the European Central Bank cut interest rates further and said it would buy back bonds indefinitely.\n\nExpectations of lower rates have spurred a Wall Street rally this year, with the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX now less than 1% below its all-time high.\n\nAt 7:00 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 18 points, or 0.07%. S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 3.25 points, or 0.11% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 9.25 points, or 0.12%.\n\nMarkets had come under pressure earlier this week after attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities caused a spike in oil prices and fueled geopolitical tensions.\n\nPackage delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) warned its full-year earnings would miss analysts\u2019 estimates, sending its shares 11.7% lower premarket.\n\nAdobe Inc (ADBE.O) fell 2.3% after the Photoshop software maker forecast tepid revenue for the current quarter.\n\nGeneral Mills Inc (GIS.N) dropped 4% after missing quarterly sales expectations, hit by weak demand for its yogurt and snacks in the U.S domestic market.\n\nData expected at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT) is expected to show U.S. housing starts rising about 5% to 1.25 million in August from a month earlier.", "description": "U.S. stock index futures dipped on Wednesday as investors waited for the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates in what has been a rocky week for global markets.", "authors": ["Medha Singh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431211638&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0U8", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
