This is not going to happen in December (Image: Getty)\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s a matter of time before we\u2019re hit by an asteroid and the European Space Agency recently found a space rock that could be on a collision course with Earth.\n\nCosmologists on the continent keep a list of all the most dangerous space rocks \u2013 and they have just added an object called 2019 SU3 to this dossier of doom.\n\nThe asteroid is 14 metres wide and has a one in 385 chance of ploughing into our planet on September 16, 2084.\n\nHowever, the impact will only be powerful enough to cause deaths in a local area.\n\nIf the asteroid hits us, humanity will certainly live to fight another day.\n\nESA added 2019 SU3 to its \u2018risk list\u2019 14 days ago. This database is \u2018a catalogue of all objects for which a non-zero impact probability has been detected\u2019.\n\nIt is expected to come within 73,435 miles of Earth, which is why it\u2019s considered so dangerous.\n\nAt that narrow distance, it\u2019s feared a slight gravitational nudge could send it careering into humanity\u2019s homeworld.\n\nHumanity could face extinction if the doomsday space rock smashed into our planet (Image: Getty)\n\nA fireball that exploded in the sky over Japan could be linked to a huge asteroid that\u2019s destined to smash into our planet, scientists also warned this week.\n\nAstronomers have been trying to work out the origins of a tiny, ping-pong ball-sized object which went kaboom as it burned up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tiny meteor posed absolutely no threat to humanity as it lit up the sky over Kyoto Airport.\n\nBut Japanese stargazers have claimed it actually broke off a monstrous space rock called 2003 YT1 that\u2019s more than a mile wide.\n\nThis object is so huge that is has it\u2019s own moon. For comparison\u2019s sake, it\u2019s believed the asteroid which killed the dinosaurs was between seven and 50 miles in diameter.\n\nIt has a 6% chance of hitting Earth at some point in the next 10 million years.\n\nIn a paper published on Arxiv, astronomers said their analysis has \u2018identified a likely parent [of the Kyoto fireball], the binary near-Earth asteroid (164121) 2003 YT1.\n\nIf humanity was still around to witness a cataclysmic impact from this apocalypse asteroid, we could face extinction or, at the very least, endure death and carnage on a global scale.\n\nThe impact would cause a fireball which would wipe out everything within a radius of hundreds of miles, throwing so much dust into the air that crops would fail around the world and mass starvation would threaten our species\u2019 future.\n\nWriting about an impact from a similarly sized object in a post on Quora, mathematician and space expert Robert Walker wrote: \u2018it would produce a crater 46 kilometres in diameter.\n\n\u2018The firestorm including debris thrown up and landing and starting up new fires would extend to 600 km from the impact point.\n\n\u2018There would be regional earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunami (if it hit the sea). Skies darker than the darkest cloud cover from the dust thrown up into the upper atmosphere, global temperature drops 8 degrees celsius for a week and moderate global effects for months. No summer that year.\n\n\u2018Plant growth is disrupted for years and there are some global crop failures and some regional extinctions. We get hit by one of these roughly every half million years on average.\u2019", "description": "Let's hope we've all been good boys and girls this year because a huge lump of space rock is the last present anyone would want for Chrimbo.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SEI_72531790_1571827077.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
