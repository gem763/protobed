Prosecutors allege she did not want to be an 18-year-old single mom. Richardson\u2019s attorneys argued that the baby was stillborn and didn\u2019t meet the legal criteria to be considered a child.\n\nRichardson, now 20, is facing trial for aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter, gross abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and child endangerment. She has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn court on Friday morning, prosecutors played a recording of a police interview with Richardson in 2017. At the end of the interview, she spoke to her father \u2014 and the conversation was recorded. A transcript was read for the jury.\n\n\u201cHoney, tell us what happened,\u201d her father said, according to the transcript.\n\n\u201cI tried to cremate the baby,\u201d Richardson allegedly said.\n\nIt\u2019s important testimony, because prosecutors and defense attorneys dispute whether the baby\u2019s body had been burned. In a police report presented in court, a homicide detective wrote that Richardson allegedly used a lighter to set her baby\u2019s foot on fire. The flames got to the baby\u2019s chest before Richardson put them out.\n\nBy the time the baby\u2019s skeletal remains were found, it was inconclusive whether her body had been burned. Her attorneys claim that she falsely admitted to burning the body after police had broken her down during questioning.\n\nRELATED: Ex-Cheerleader Accused of Killing Newborn Blew off Doctors\u2019 Calls, Didn\u2019t Have Ultrasound: Prosecutors\n\nCharles Rittgers More\n\nRELATED: Everything to Know About Trial for Cheerleader Accused of Murdering Her Newborn and Burying Body\n\nProsecutors allege that Richardson did not want to be an 18-year-old single mom with college only a few months away. In the months after learning of her pregnancy, Richardson didn\u2019t return for an ultrasound, bloodwork or any other treatment, while ignoring calls from the doctor and assistants, prosecutors have said.\n\nIn the police interview played in court on Thursday, Richardson allegedly told police that she didn\u2019t return her doctor\u2019s phone calls because she was scared. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to have my baby,\u201d she told police. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what I planned to do.\u201d\n\nShe also told police that she looked into an abortion, but it was too late to have one. She denied that she performed an abortion on herself.\n\nWhen her parents walked into the room after the police interview, Richardson addressed her mother. \u201cMommy,\u201d she said, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, mommy.\u201d\n\nHer parents hugged her. \u201cYou should have just told us,\u201d her father said. \u201cKids get pregnant every day,\u201d her mother added. \u201cPregnancy is not the end of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom, do you have any idea how I feel?\u201d Richardson asked. Her mother replied, \u201cDo you have any idea how we feel?\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ex-Cheerleader Accused of Killing & Burying Newborn Didn\u2019t Want to be Mom, Worrying Doctor: Prosecutor\n\nWarren County Sheriff's Office More", "description": "Ohio Cheerleader Allegedly Said: 'I Tried to Cremate My Baby'", "authors": ["Steve Helling"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iN5rCWH7Vr7NqtiycSdBvQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/910b5da68490d7652a284eda9c26f806", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
