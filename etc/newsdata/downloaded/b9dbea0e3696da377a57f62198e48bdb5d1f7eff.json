Shortages have been going on for months but reached 'crisis point' this week as most Evorel patches \u2013 the UK market leader \u2013 disappeared from the shelves. Many alternatives were already out of stock and the two main pharmaceutical wholesalers have completely run out of all commonly-prescribed HRT patches, according to an audit seen by the Daily Mail. Manufacturers are rationing what little stock they have with the support of the Department of Health, which has been slammed for its 'disastrous' handling of the crisis. Some women have been buying boxes for their friends from pharmacies while on holiday in Spain. One patient has even been air-freighting HRT from South Africa. Around two-thirds of HRT treatments have been hit by shortages. They include Evorel and Elleste, the two most popular brands, which are prescribed to upwards of 100,000 women a year \u2013 more than half of those on the treatment. More than half of women on HRT are prescribed patches, which are applied once or twice a week below the waist.\n\nStaff said patients 'asked daily if [shortages] are because of Brexit', although there is no evidence that current shortages are linked to leaving the EU.\n\nAlima Batchelor, Head of Policy at the PDA, said: 'These survey results from our members operating across the profession present a stark picture of the huge stresses which drug shortages are causing for both pharmacists and patients.\n\n'Whilst these shortages cannot be ascribed to Brexit, they do show the need for concerted action to ensure that leaving the EU will not exacerbate an already unacceptable level of drug shortages.\n\n'We call upon the DHSC and Treasury to use every avenue available to them to identify and address the causes of drug shortages (whatever these may be) and to look at rational steps which could be taken to reduce inappropriate overuse of prescribed medicines, thus reducing demand.'\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: 'We fully understand the concerns some people have about the availability of medicines.\n\n'We are doing everything we can to help ensure they can access the treatments they need after Brexit.\n\n'The NHS has tried and tested ways of making sure patients get the medicines that they need, even under difficult circumstances.\n\n'There is no evidence of any supply shortages being related to Brexit.\n\n'The Government, industry and NHS have put in place robust preparations for Brexit, which consists of stockpiling, securing transport and warehouse capacity and working closely with businesses on their readiness for day one.'", "description": "One in four pharmacists in the UK said their patients have come to harm because they could not get vital medication, a poll by the Pharmacists' Defence Association found.", "authors": ["Eleanor Hayward Health Reporter For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19742266-0-image-a-35_1571146515322.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
