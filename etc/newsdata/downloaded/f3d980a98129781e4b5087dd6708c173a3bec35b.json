Especially because Jon Jones has faced most of the top guys and beat most of the top guys. Why not?\u201d\n\nA former UFC middleweight champ, Weidman (14-4 MMA, 10-4 UFC) has long been tied to his fellow New York native Jones (25-1 MMA, 19-1 UFC). The two fighters reigned as champions in their respective divisions simultaneously from 2013-2015.\n\nA superfight between the two came up in many theoretical discussions amongst followers of the sport. Weidman wishes it had come to fruition when he was champion, but having lost the belt doesn\u2019t deter his confidence in the matchup.\n\n\u201cI always believed I had the ability to beat him,\u201d Weidman said. \u201cI always imagined defending my belt until I decided to stop, and then going up and beating him, too. Obviously, it didn\u2019t work out as planned for me. This new plan works out just fine. He definitely looks very beatable after watching his last two fights against two 185 pounders.\u201d\n\nThe current status of today\u2019s hyped-up superfights revolves around ongoing trash talk between Jones and the man who owns the title Weidman once held, middleweight champ Israel Adesanya.\n\nDespite Adesanya\u2019s recent social media beef with Jones, \u201cThe All American\u201d beating Reyes will make the Nigerian\u2019s efforts all for not.\n\n\u201cI think Israel Adesanya did a great job in his last fight,\u201d Weidman said. \u201cI think he\u2019s trying to bait him into coming up and taking a big fight because Adesanya became a big star. I think it\u2019s a big fight for Jon Jones. I think he\u2019s just trying to egg him on, but I\u2019m going to ruin all of that.\u201d\n\nWeidman is confident in a matchup against Jones \u2013 but why? From a technical standpoint, Weidman believes wrestling is the X-factor.\n\n\u201cI think the wrestling is really the key for him,\u201d Weidman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a striker, he\u2019s going to look for a way to bait you into him taking you down. Then you have trouble on your back. I think a wrestler with jiu-jitsu is a problem for him.\n\n\u201cCormier had the wrestling. Not as much jiu-jitsu, but he had good positioning on top and stuff. He\u2019s way shorter, and that reach disadvantage is huge. With me, it\u2019s not as bad. I have better footwork and stuff. I can move in and out and kind of trick to the legs a little easier.\u201d", "description": "Despite Israel Adesanya's recent beef with Jon Jones, Chris Weidman beating Dominick Reyes will make his efforts all for not.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Simon Samano", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/chris-weidman-ufc-230.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
