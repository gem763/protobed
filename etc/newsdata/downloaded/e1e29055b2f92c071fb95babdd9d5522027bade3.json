Not when one considers that only about 7 per cent of the wider population are educated at independent schools. It goes without saying that to get into one of them you have to have unusually wealthy parents, with the exception of a small number of pupils on scholarship.\n\nIndependent schools act as both agents of inequality and bulwarks against social mobility.\n\nCambridge says it is working hard to improve the diversity of its students. But the fact that nearly a third of them come from a privileged 7 per cent of the country\u2019s schoolchildren shows it is still serving to reinforce those bulwarks.\n\nThe Sutton Trust, which champions social mobility, does speak well of some of its efforts (the two organisations have been working together) but they are at best chipping away at the problem when, really, those bulwarks need tearing down.\n\nThe trust\u2019s figures demonstrate a clear need for further action. Business, politics, the media, the civil service; all have a disproportionate number of privately educated individuals in their senior echelons.\n\nSome 65 per cent of senior judges went to independent schools, 59 per pent of civil service permanent secretaries did the same, as did 57 per cent of the House of Lords, 57 per cent of the Sunday Times Rich List and 48 per cent of FTSE 350 CEOs (excluding those educated internationally). Some 15 and 14 per cent of the latter two, respectively, had been to Oxbridge compared to less than 1 per cent of the population overall.\n\nYou will often hear corporate kingpins claim business is a meritocracy. Those figures suggest otherwise.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Just 5 per cent of male and 2 per cent of female professionals attended independent schools.\n\nThe contrast with Britain\u2019s dismal current cabinet is similarly stark. The trust\u2019s figures show 39 per cent of its ministers went to private school. For the shadow cabinet the figure is 9 per cent.\n\nThere is a certain symmetry with the Cambridge figures being released on the same day the TUC called for the government to legislate against class-based discrimination.\n\nThe trade unions body wants to make class a protected characteristic along with race, gender, sexuality and disability, and to have discrimination based on it made illegal.\n\nIts proposals also include giving public bodies a legal duty to tackle inequality and requiring companies to report their class pay gaps alongside their gender pay gaps.\n\nThe problem with affording protected status to a characteristic is that the legal protections that come with it don\u2019t always work so well in practice. The disability employment gap, for example, has barely moved in more than a decade. As someone in that group, who writes about disability, I regularly hear stories from people who are treated appallingly at their workplaces.\n\nBut the TUC\u2019s proposals are nonetheless worth considering. They might serve to help kick-start progress on the issue.\n\nIt will, however, almost certainly require a change of government for anything to happen. The current cabinet of privileged millionaires seems more intent on widening divisions than healing them.", "description": "Ambitions of landing a top job in business, politics, the law, the civil service?
