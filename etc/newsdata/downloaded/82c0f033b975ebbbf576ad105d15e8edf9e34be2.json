Trying to keep up with the latest styles involves regular visits to the shops and sometimes forking out for expensive designer clothes. But when the fashion changes, these clothes languish in the back of cupboards gathering dust, or just get thrown away.\n\nThere are many stores that now offer cheap \u2018fast fashion\u2019 \u2013 low-price items that imitate the styles of more expensive designer brands. Environmentalists are angered by the amount of energy involved in making these clothes and that many of them are made from non-recyclable materials. This means that items are just incinerated or go into landfill.\n\nWriting about this for the BBC, Eleanor Lawrie says that people in the UK are the worst in Europe for doing this - with a million tonnes of unwanted textiles a year being discarded. And she says \u201con top of often poor labour conditions for garment workers, the fashion industry is responsible for 20% of the world's waste water, and 10% of carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nThis is something the fashion industry is becoming more aware of and has led to a new crop of biomaterials that replace wasteful textiles like cotton and leather. Examples include Pi\u00f1atex, a leather-like substance made from discarded pineapple leaves. It's been used in collections by Hugo Boss and H&M. And there\u2019s mycelium, the root structure of mushrooms, that\u2019s being used to create food, packaging and textiles.\n\nCotton is a very resource-intense crop to grow. Eleanor Lawrie says \u201cabout 15,000 litres of water [are] required to make one pair of jeans.\u201d So, buying organic cotton is a better choice. And there is also Tencel, also known as Lyocell, a natural product that's now growing in popularity. It's made by extracting cellulose fibre from trees; its manufacture is thought to use 95% less water than cotton processing.\n\nBut creating sustainable textiles is only part of the battle \u2013 buying ethically, buying second hand and buying fewer clothes are the obvious environmentally friendly choices. Dr Richard Blackburn from Leeds School of Design told the BBC that \u201cI don't think you should consider buying any item of clothing unless you commit to 30 wears. Unless you can do that you're not even starting to be sustainable.\u201d\n\n\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\n\nfashion victim \u76f2\u76ee\u8ffd\u6c42\u65f6\u5c1a\u7684\u4eba\n\nstyle \uff08\u670d\u88c5\uff09\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u6d41\u884c\u5f0f\u6837\n\nfork out \uff08\u4e0d\u60c5\u613f\u5730\uff09\u4ed8\u94b1\n\ndesigner \u51fa\u81ea\u8457\u540d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u7684\uff0c\u540d\u724c\u7684\n\nfast fashion \u201c\u5feb\u65f6\u5c1a\u201d\uff0c\u6307\u66f4\u65b0\u9891\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u4ef7\u683c\u4f4e\u5ec9\u3001\u7d27\u8ddf\u65f6\u5c1a\u98ce\u6f6e\u7684\u670d\u88c5\n\nmaterial \u6750\u6599\n\nincinerate \u711a\u70e7\n\nlandfill \u5783\u573e\u586b\u57cb\u573a\n\ntextile \u7eba\u7ec7\u54c1\n\ndiscarded \u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\u7684\n\ngarment worker \u670d\u88c5\u5de5\u4eba\n\nbiomaterial \u751f\u7269\u6750\u6599\n\ncotton \u68c9\n\nleather \u76ae\u9769\n\nPi\u00f1atex \u201c\u83e0\u841d\u76ae\u9769\u201d\uff0c\u7528\u83e0\u841d\u53f6\u5236\u6210\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u76ae\u9769\u9762\u6599\n\ncollection \uff08\u670d\u88c5\u54c1\u724c\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\uff09\u65f6\u88c5\u7cfb\u5217\n\norganic \u6709\u673a\u7684\n\nTencel \u201c\u5929\u4e1d\u7ed2\u201d\n\nLyocell \u83b1\u8d5b\u5c14\u7ea4\u7ef4\n\ncellulose fibre \u518d\u751f\u7ea4\u7ef4\u7d20\u7ea4\u7ef4\n\nsustainable \u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\n\nethically \u7b26\u5408\u9053\u5fb7\u51c6\u5219\u5730\n\n\u6d4b\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7ec3\u4e60\n\n1. \u9605\u8bfb\u8bfe\u6587\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n1.
