Think about the blood! The pus! And worst of all, another pimple coming to its rescue, and now you\u2019re back in the dreaded cycle all over again.\n\nIs there a safe way to pop a pimple? While there are no guarantees in life, especially when it comes to acne removal, there are a few ways to help manage the experience as best you can. Here\u2019s all the advice you need on finally getting rid of the pimple that\u2019s staring you down in the mirror.\n\nIf you'd prefer to avoid a starring role on Sandra Lee's Dr Pimple Popper show, here's what you need to know!\n\nFigure out if it\u2019s actually worth popping\n\nFirst, you should know that popping a pimple is rarely dermatologist-recommended, if ever.\n\n\u201cEffectively, we never ever really want you to pop a pimple, it has very little upside from a dermatologists\u2019 perspective,\u201d Dr Ranella Hirsch, a dermatologist, said over the phone. \u201cThe risk becomes significant for infection and that\u2019s generally the single biggest reason not to do it.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, you\u2019ll also risk a number of other unwanted side-effects, such as making inflammation worse or scarring your skin permanently, she added.\n\nBut if you absolutely must (and if you\u2019ve stumbled on this article, you\u2019re clearly interested), you should also know that not all acne is created equal.\n\nSome acne comes to a head, creating the familiar white or yellow bump. This is the easier sort of pimple to pop, as it\u2019s on the surface of the skin.\n\nCystic acne, however, is the kind you\u2019d never want to pop, as it\u2019s deeper in your skin. It\u2019s usually larger, more painful, and also more prone to scarring \u2014 and popping it won\u2019t help.\n\n\u201cA lot of times nothing will come out and people will just keep squeezing and trying to get something. You really don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Hirsch said.\n\nShe added that if there\u2019s an open wound or infection on your skin, it\u2019s best to skip popping it, as that\u2019s usually indicative of larger health concerns you should address beforehand (go to a doctor!).\n\nPrepare the pimple\n\nSo you\u2019re doing it \u2014 godspeed! You\u2019ll need a couple of tools. For one, Hirsch recommends sterilising the pimple and its surrounding area with rubbing alcohol (like an alcohol pad you might find in a first-aid kit). \u201cYou really going to want to really clear any bacteria that you\u2019re going to introduce by popping the pimple,\u201d she said.\n\nNext, decide your plan of attack. While you could use your fingernails, Hirsch recommended gauze to cover them, so you don\u2019t spread bacteria (from experience, some websites may also recommend cotton buds, but those are too messy and you have less control over them).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also extraction tools that you can buy at places like Sephora or Ulta [which] are better because you\u2019re getting even pressure around what you\u2019re trying to extract,\u201d she said.\n\nThese tools tend to look a lot more like needles and tend to be a little more precise than your fingers (and you want to be precise).\n\nPop it and use a topical corticosteroid\n\nOh my god, you\u2019re doing it.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve used some rubbing alcohol, have it on stand-by. Regardless of the tool at your disposal, you\u2019re going to want to press the pimple from around a 90-degree angle, according to Hirsch (as if you\u2019re attacking the pimple from the sides. Maybe it won\u2019t see?)\n\nContinue to push until you\u2019ve extracted all of the white head material, and once it\u2019s gone, sterilise the area once more with rubbing alcohol \u2014 you don\u2019t want to risk developing another pimple again.\n\nDab a topical corticosteroid or an acne spot treatment over it and continue to keep the area as clean as possible (which means no fussing with it after you\u2019ve done the deed).\n\nWhy You Keep Getting Acne In The Same Spot Zits are unfair. We didn't ask for them, we certainly don't deserve to have them into adulthood, and it's especially insulting when you finally get a giant pimple to go away and then it comes right back a few days later.

Your pimple may be a cyst and there\u2019s no point in doing anything about it beyond using acne medication or seeing a doctor.\n\nPopping a pimple should be easy, and if it\u2019s requiring more effort than necessary, you\u2019re likely going to do more damage \u2014 and who wants that?\n\nGo see a doctor\n\nSo you\u2019ve decided to see a doctor instead. That\u2019s the safer choice, according to Hirsch. \u201cIf it\u2019s really inflamed, hot, or bothering you, we much prefer you come to see us so that we could do it under sterile conditions,\u201d she said.\n\nAt a dermatologist\u2019s office, they can often provide you with a corticosteroid injection shot into the pimple itself (this can also help solve the problem of a deeper cyst, too). These take only a few seconds, and within 24 hours, the pimple swells down significantly.\n\nHow To Get Rid Of Your Acne Scars Few skin conditions torpedo self-esteem the way acne does. As it turns out, a face full of painful lesions \u2014 not to mention unsolicited, tone-deaf advice from family and strangers alike \u2014 has a way of driving people into hiding. Read more\n\nThis comes with the caveat that injections are often much more expensive than your usual acne treatment, and using too many corticosteroid injections can result in \u201cpitting\u201d or gradual indents. But if you\u2019re desperate and tomorrow\u2019s the big wedding day or an otherwise important event, it doesn\u2019t hurt to try it once (just don\u2019t make it a habit).", "description": "Come on now, we\u2019ve all done it.", "authors": ["Alan Henry", "Kevin Purdy"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2019/10/Dr-Sandra-Lee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
