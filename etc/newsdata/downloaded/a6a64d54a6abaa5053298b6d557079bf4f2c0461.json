Thanks to everyone in advance for their support and kind words.\n\n\"The support has been immense, the support kind words alone are making such a difference. Thank you again so much everyone.\"\n\nBev added: \"They are both broken, there are no words I can use to describe what they are going through, though Nile has been very strong.\n\n\"Neither of them have been home since this started. and we are all very grateful to the Candlelighters charity for helping to ensure this.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Elijah's body just wouldn't take the transplant and they didn't want him to suffer anymore and he died on Tuesday.\"\n\nMore than \u00a31,000 has been raised for the family since Elijah' death yesterday.\n\nYou can donate here .", "description": "Twin baby boys Elijah and Emre Liburd were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia just months after their births", "authors": ["Robert Sutcliffe", "Image", "Examiner Live Ws", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article15017805.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS181798531.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
