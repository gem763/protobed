Of those women, about 6 400 had been diagnosed with ADHD.\n\nTeenage births were 6.2 times more likely among women and girls with ADHD, researchers found.\n\nFemales with ADHD also were more likely to have risk factors that could harm their pregnancy, including smoking during the third trimester (6.8 times as likely), morbid obesity (two times as likely) and alcohol or drug abuse (20 times as likely).\n\nPeople with ADHD have trouble keeping their lives organised, which means girls are more likely to forget to carry around condoms or take their birth control pill daily, Arnold explained.\n\nThey also are more likely to be impulsive and take risks in their daily lives, Arnold and Skoglund said.\n\nHowever, it also appears as though doctors, counselors and parents aren't taking ADHD into account when talking safe sex with teen girls, Skoglund and Arnold added.\n\n\"Women with ADHD may receive inadequate contraceptive counseling in regards to their underlying difficulties,\" Skoglund said. \"They somehow fail to access - or inadequately respond or act upon - such counseling.\"\n\nADHD underdiagnosed\n\nContraception is widely available in Sweden, Skoglund said, but that doesn't seem to make a difference for girls with ADHD.\n\n\"In contrast to those without a diagnosis, this group doesn't seem to benefit from guidance on contraception and societal interventions targeting the risk for early and unplanned pregnancies that has been very successful in other groups of teens,\" Skoglund said.\n\nThe problem is compounded by the fact that ADHD is under-recognised and underdiagnosed among females, she added.\n\nSkoglund and Arnold said it is very important for parents of an ADHD-diagnosed teen girl to make sure their disorder is being adequately treated.\n\n\"In addition, they should make sure that their daughters have sufficient contraception, and intervene to prevent early debut and use of alcohol and illicit drugs,\" Skoglund said.\n\nParents might want to consult with the girl's gynaecologist about forms of birth control that don't require daily attention, such as a hormone implant or an IUD, Arnold said.\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "The impulsiveness and disorganisation associated with ADHD appear to make girls with the disorder more likely to become pregnant - a problem compounded by the fact that ADHD is under-recognised and underdiagnosed among females.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9433/3eeca7cd0c3e402aa5324b4b80978052.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
