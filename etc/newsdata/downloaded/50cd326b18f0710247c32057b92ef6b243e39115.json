Police searched his home in the nearby town of Langen overnight.\n\nThe original driver of the truck, who was not named, was quoted by daily Frankfurter Neue Presse (FNP) as saying a man had \u201cdragged\u201d him out of his lorry.\n\nHe said the man, with short dark hair and a full beard, had yanked open the driver-side door and stared at him wide-eyed before forcing him out of the vehicle.\n\n\u201cI asked him \u2018What do you want from me?\u2019,\u201d he told FNP. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d\n\nThe truck sped into the parked cars a few hundred metres (yards) away and came to a stop on the central reservation of a six-lane road.\n\nWhen the man behind the wheel of the truck emerged from the crash, several passers-by provided first aid, FNP said.\n\n\u201cThe passers-by said the driver said \u2018Allah\u2019 several times\u201d and spoke Arabic, FNP reported.\n\nPolice did not confirm this account.\n\nBettina Yeisley from Limburg, whose office is next to the scene of the crash, told FNP she heard a loud bang and ran out onto the street with colleagues.\n\nThey found the driver sitting by the roadside.\n\n\u201cHe was bleeding from the nose, his hands were bloody, his trousers torn. He said that everything hurt. I asked him his name and he said, \u2018My name is Mohammed\u2019.\u201d\n\nAuthorities urged users of social media not to jump to conclusions about the motive.\n\n\u201cWe are not ruling anything out,\u201d a spokesman for the state police force told DPA. \u201cBut we call on you: don\u2019t take part in speculation!\u201d the regional police wrote in several tweets.\n\nThe Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany\u2019s domestic security watchdog, warned in April of an increased risk posed by IS fighters returning from Syria and northern Iraq.\n\nIts director Thomas Haldenwang said an estimated 2,240 Islamists with \u201cterrorist potential\u201d were living in Germany.\n\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany party has seized on Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to leave the German border open to more than one million migrants and refugees in 2015-16, accusing her government of compromising national security.\n\nIt is now the biggest opposition party in parliament.", "description": "Frankfurt am Main (AFP) \u2013 German prosecutors on Tuesday were probing whether a \u201cterrorist\u201d motive led a man to hijack an articulated", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/39e9b0_articulated-lorry-slammed-cars-waiting-traffic-light-motive-unclear-german-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
