RBNZ is planning on publishing its final requirements later in the year.\n\nAPRA said on Tuesday it is proposing to limit the amount of the exposure to an individual subsidiary that a bank can leverage (meaning the group in Australia does not to hold dollar-for-dollar capital at the parent company level) to 10 per cent of a bank\u2019s CET1 capital.\n\n\u201cThese proposed measures seek to support the resilience of the major banks' Australian operations,\u201d APRA deputy chair John Lonsdale said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn relation to New Zealand, there are a number of options available to the banks.
