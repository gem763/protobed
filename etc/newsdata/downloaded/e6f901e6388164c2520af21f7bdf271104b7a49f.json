It was not clear exactly what topics were discussed or how long the meeting lasted, the people said.\n\nOne of WeWork's challenges is $6 billion in financing tied to the success of an IPO that JPMorgan is leading, one of the people said. The financing offer is good until December 31. If WeWork hasn't gone public by then, the terms will expire and the real-estate company will be forced to negotiate new terms, one of the people said.\n\nSpokespeople from both JPMorgan and WeWork declined to comment. A representative for SoftBank, WeWork's largest shareholder, also declined to comment.\n\nDimon has had a busy few weeks when it comes to struggling IPOs. SmileDirectClub stumbled so badly in its first day of trading earlier this month that its CEO, David Katzman, held a call with the JPMorgan CEO to figure out exactly what happened, sources told Business Insider.\n\nRead more: SmileDirectClub's IPO was such a disaster that the CEO called up JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon to ask what went wrong\n\nMoney-losing WeWork in recent weeks had mulled the drastic step of slashing its IPO valuation to as low as $10 billion, down from $47 billion in its last SoftBank-rolled funding round, in order to drum up investor interest, according to media reports. Now the coworking company has put its IPO plans on ice, and pressure is mounting on Neumann, who has drawn criticism for his financial ties to and behavior while running the company he cofounded.\n\nAccording to the latest media reports, big WeWork investors and board members are considering an ouster as soon as this week, though that process would be complicated by the fact that Neumann holds the majority of voting power at the company.\n\nJPMorgan has good reason to see a successful WeWork IPO. Besides serving as the lead underwriter and taking part in the financing agreement tied to the IPO, JPMorgan is among the banks that have made personal loans to Neumann, some of which are backed by WeWork shares. It has also played a part in WeWork's early fundraising \u2014 JPMorgan funds make it the third-largest non-We-management-related investor, with 18.5 million shares, according to WeWork's August S-1 filing.\n\nRead more: WeWork's competitors are scrambling to distance themselves from the co-working giant, but many are following the same script\n\nUnder current terms, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and other underwriters in the planned IPO have agreed to provide senior secured financing of up to $6 billion to WeWork, contingent on the company raising at least $3 billion, according to WeWork's S-1 filing.\n\nNeumann himself also has a WeWork share-backed line of credit of up to $500 million from JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, and UBS, with around $380 million principal outstanding as of July. He's also borrowed another $97.5 million from JPMorgan for things like mortgages secured by personal property but not by any shares.\n\nIt wasn't always clear that JPMorgan would have such an active role in the IPO or the attached financing. In July, The Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs was leading a possible financing package that would have been independent of the IPO. It's not clear why or when the financing package changed from Goldman's structure to JPMorgan's.\n\nRead more: JPMorgan and UBS private wealth execs explain why they're doing more private share-backed lending to Silicon Valley. Both banks have lent to WeWork CEO Adam Neumann.\n\nSome think it was unwise to link the debt to the IPO because it both telegraphs the company's cash needs to the market and sets up a situation in which a cash crunch means the company may be rushed into doing an IPO.\n\nThis all comes at a crucial time for WeWork to plan for its future. Nine-year-old WeWork's average revenue per members has declined, and it said that was expected to keep falling as it grows overseas. The company said in the August filing that the timing of any future profitability depended on \"levers\" it has control over \u2014 most of which involve slowing down its expansion.", "description": "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and embattled WeWork CEO Adam Neumann talked about how to get WeWork's delayed IPO back on track.", "authors": ["Dakin Campbell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d88efcb2e22af234c2ae785?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
