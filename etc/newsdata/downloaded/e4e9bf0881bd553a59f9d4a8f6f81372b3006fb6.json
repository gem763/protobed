It's estimated that this big boi has a six per cent chance of hitting Earth at some point in the next 10 million years. Admittedly, that's a pretty big range but still, yikes.\n\nMysterious Chilean Fireballs Weren't Meteorites, So What Were They? Flashes lit up the sky over Chile last week, some even causing fires on the ground \u2014 but a new report has found that the origin of these fireballs is a mystery. Read more\n\n2003 YT1 was first discovered in 2003 and is a binary asteroid. This means there's a primary and secondary asteroid orbiting the same axle known as a barycenter. That two kilometre asteroid is the big daddy but it has a little child, which shares its space, with around a 200 metre diameter.\n\nThat six per cent chance is very small but it's enough for scientists to deem it potentially hazardous.\n\nNot that I wish certain distress on future generations but let's hope that tiny window doesn't occur within our lifetime.", "description": "Back in 2017, a fireball lit up the skies of Japan and no one knew what was going on.
