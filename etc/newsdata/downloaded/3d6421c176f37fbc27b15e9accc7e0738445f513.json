The BBC could not independently verify its veracity\n\nDozens of people have been arrested in Pakistan after a teenager accused his Hindu headteacher of blasphemy, sparking riots.\n\nThe principal, who owns the school, was accused of making comments about the Prophet Muhammad in Sindh province.\n\nA large mob then allegedly attacked a Hindu temple, shops and the school in the town of Ghotki on Saturday.\n\nThe principal is now in custody facing blasphemy charges. If found guilty, he could face the death penalty.\n\nThe rioters have also been charged under the blasphemy act, according to BBC reporters in Pakistan. However, they face a lesser charge of attacking a temple which does not carry the possibility of a death sentence.\n\nPakistani media reports say 43 people were charged in connection with the attack. A number of others were charged with rioting and theft, Dawn newspaper reports.\n\n\"Alleged accused in a sensitive case of Ghotki is now in the custody of police,\" Dr Jamil Ahmed, the additional inspector general of the local police force, tweeted.\n\n\"Situation in Ghotki is back to normal within 12 hours. Fair investigation is being done after confirming facts and justice ensured. Cases against hooligans are being registered and miscreants being nabbed.\"\n\nThe unrest has sparked widespread comment on social media and revived debate about Pakistan's draconian blasphemy laws.\n\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has condemned the violence, sharing a video of the alleged destruction on Twitter.\n\n\"The video... is chilling: mob violence against a member of a religious minority is barbaric, unacceptable,\" it said in the post.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Asia Bibi's escape from Pakistan death row\n\nThe blasphemy laws have been under the spotlight internationally after Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian who spent eight years on death row, was freed from prison earlier this year, following a Supreme Court decision which overturned her conviction.\n\nHer release sparked riots, and she was forced to seek safety in another country.\n\nWhat are the blasphemy laws?\n\nIslam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong.\n\nHard-line politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base.\n\nBut critics say the laws have often been used to exact revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence.\n\nThe vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community who identify themselves as Muslims but are regarded as heretical by orthodox Islam.\n\nSince the 1990s scores of Christians have also been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population.\n\nThe Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance.\n\nSince 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy.", "description": "Mob violence was unleashed after a Hindu headteacher was accused of making blasphemous comments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5A66/production/_108824132_dbec3589-3875-430a-bd38-555dd11324c6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
