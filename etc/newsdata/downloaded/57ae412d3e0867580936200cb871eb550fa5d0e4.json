We\u2019ve done the Royal Variety, we\u2019ve played in China, Monaco - everywhere.\"\n\nHe indicated that his 17-year-old cousin would be taking on the role in the act, which exploded on to TV screens in 2009 with a hilarious outtake on Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance routine.\n\nThey first appeared in the 2009 series, which also saw the emergence of Susan Boyle and was won by acclaimed dance act, Diversity.\n\nTheir prospective swansong performance has put them among the favourites to win the BGT Champions series.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
