Check it out below, then subscribe to get future editions of Dollar Scholar every Wednesday.\n\nNext month is the five-year anniversary of me moving to New York City, which means it\u2019s also the five-year anniversary of me getting my first-ever Adult Job\u2122. I worked full-time during the last couple semesters of college, but I didn\u2019t become a legit salaried employee until fall 2014. Though I made almost no money \u2014 especially after I discovered how easy it was to order food to my Brooklyn apartment \u2014 I managed to scrape by.\n\nNow, half a decade later, I\u2019m fortunate enough to have a little bit of extra cash. Not much, mind you \u2014 I still get empanadas delivered on a regular basis \u2014 but enough that I could put some of it away\u2026 if I knew how.\n\nIs there a minimum amount of money I need to begin investing? And how exactly do I get started?\n\nBecause most of my investing knowledge comes from the time my fifth-grade class played the stock market, I called Corbin Blackwell, a certified financial planner who works with Betterment. Blackwell told me that before I start investing, I should make sure I have a solid emergency fund that can cover three to six months of expenses.\n\nA good place to start investing is in my 401(k), a retirement plan offered by my employer. Not all companies have them, but those that do often match the money workers put in (to a certain amount). Specifically, Blackwell said I should look into choosing a target date fund, which she called \u201can easy, straightforward, pre-packaged way to make a smart investment.\u201d\n\nWith a target date fund, I first select the year I think I\u2019ll retire (and therefore need the money). Then I contribute, and someone else manages the allocation of assets, or stocks and bonds, over time. As the target date gets closer, the manager will tweak my portfolio so the level of risk decreases.\n\n\u201cUnless you choose a target date that\u2019s so wildly off your retirement date, it\u2019s hard to screw it up,\u201d Blackwell adds. Speaking my language!\n\nFrom there, she said I can check out a robo-advisor, or a digital money manager. Betterment is just one of many, but it happens to be MONEY\u2019s favorite option for beginners (as ranked last year). Betterment prides itself on goals-based investing and auto-rebalancing over time, which means it makes adjustments on my behalf to make sure I meet my targets. There\u2019s no minimum to open an account under its Digital plan, which has a 0.25% annual fee.\n\nAfter signing up, I\u2019ll tell my robo-advisor how much money I want to invest and set a risk level I feel comfortable with. Then I\u2019ll just let it run on its own.\n\nAccording to Blackwell, I might just end up learning something.\n\n\u201cOnce you have skin in the game, it is more interesting, because then you start getting curious about what you own and why you chose it and that sort of thing,\u201d she says.\n\nSounds responsible. But I\u2019m not always responsible, so I had another question for Misty Lynch, the head of financial planning for John Hancock: What\u2019s stopping me from taking, like, $200 and buying, like, a single share of Apple?\n\nThe answer is nothing. However, as Lynch explained, then all of my metaphorical eggs would be in one basket. It\u2019d be wiser to put my money into something like an index fund, where I\u2019d essentially buy into lots of different companies.\n\n\u201cIf you own a big, broad index, that makes things a little bit less risky,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could either choose Italian food or one specific entree. Chances are, if you go broader, you\u2019re going to maybe have a little bit more luck.\u201d\n\nBottom line? Once I have my emergency fund set up, I should make sure I\u2019m putting money into my employer-sponsored 401(k). Then I can open an account with a robo-advisor. I don\u2019t need a lot of money to start investing \u2014 $50 or $100 is a fine starting place.\n\nWhat I shouldn\u2019t do, according to Lynch, is wait too long. I should begin building the habit now.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Plus, is there a minimum amount you need?", "authors": ["Julia Glum"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eIo0q8Pp5k5PtqnCfZ_AyQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/fa6ade36e6879a2471b05b6c2ac9d7ab", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
