A judgement is expected shortly.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph understands that Guantanamo Bay remains one of the options for the Isil \"Beatles' pair if the Supreme Court does not green-light their trial in the American courts.\n\nIn a statement, her lawyers said she was \u201csurprised and bitterly disappointed\u201d her attempts to have her son face justice in the UK rather than a death sentence in the US had \u201cto date not succeeded.\u201d \u201cShe believes a UK trial can still happen,\u201d said her lawyers, Birnberg Peirce.\n\nThey are understood to be exploring ways in which they could secure a UK trial following admissions by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) that there was sufficient evidence to charge and try the pair in the UK, despite previous denials.\n\nThey acknowledge the US will claim \"possession is ten tenths of the law\" and transport them to the US even before the supreme court judgement is handed down.\n\nHowever, Clive Stafford-Smith, a human rights lawyer who has taken multiple trips to the prisons in Syria, said the US's transfer from Syria to Iraq amounted to an illegal rendition.\n\nThe Home Office, which has stripped the two of their British citizenship, will not hand over evidence until the Supreme Court verdict, which could be followed by an appeal to the European Court of Justice.\n\nBut a Government source said: \u201cThey are not British citizens and they are not coming back to this country.\u201d\n\nIn their last TV interviews before the US took them, the pair dodged the opportunity to directly apologise for the death of aid worker David Haines. Mr Elsheikh said he would \u201coffer my sincere apology\u201d for his role in the logistical side of the terror group, moving him from location to location.\n\nToby Cadman, the British lawyer for Diane Foley, whose son James Foley, an American journalist, was executed by the 'Beatles', said: \"We are concerned at the information they are being taken to the US when there are still proceedings ongoing in the UK Supreme Court.\n\n\"We want to see them tried here or else in a US judicial court - that would be the preference. What we don't want is them being taken to Guantanamo because we want them to face justice.\"\n\nMrs Foley is opposed to the death penalty and is concerned that the pair will be executed if found guilty after a trial in the US.", "description": "The two British Islamic State (Isil) terrorists from the so-called \u201cBeatles\u201d cell are set to be taken to the US despite a pending Supreme Court judgement that could prevent the UK giving evidence.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GCxelOp7LKA23e.QBAeJpA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/62f6ce34c6c00b2c8bdb17c7391968d8", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
