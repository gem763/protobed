Here's how does it works:\n\n\n\nAs a travel programme with over 133 million members to inspire, across 132 countries and territories, Marriott BonVoy Moments is aiming to take its rewards programme beyond the cookie cutter experience.\n\nMembers traditionally earn points by staying at one of over 7 000 Marriott BonVoy participating properties globally, including Protea properties locally \u2013 click here for more info.\n\nThese points can be used as a currency to place a bid to secure an exclusive experience via the Marriott Moment platform.\n\nMarriott says it knows its guests want travel to be seamless and intuitive, with the Marriott BonVoy Moments creating their \u201cexperiential marketplace where members can pursue their passions by bidding their points for money-can\u2019t-buy, exclusive experiences\u201d.\n\nThese moments are only available to members and can only accessed by using points.\n\nAccording to Marriott data, in 2018 members redeemed more than 783 million points, on 8 640 exclusive Moments. But by the sounds of it these are for the travelling, loyal die-hards with a reserve bid set, in relation to the experience offered.\n\nMoments bids can range from 15 000 points all the way to several million points per experience.\n\nTo put this into context, Marriott details that one night at top properties like St Regis Bora Bora resort or the Al Maha Desert Resort and Spa in the UAE earns 85 000 points a night in Peak Season.\n\n\u201cMarriott Bonvoy\u2019s partnership with the NFL enabled us to offer more than 200 exclusive member-experiences around the Super Bowl. One member redeemed over 3.2 million points (a record) for the Ultimate Courtyard Super Bowl LIII Sleepover\u201d.\n\n\"With a companion, they spent the night in a luxury suite at Mercedes Benz Stadium, designed to be a Courtyard guest room (they are the official hotel of the NFL) the night before the Super Bowl and woke up to watch all the action from there. They also hung-out with Jerry Rice, Aaron Rodgers and JJ Watt, and broke bread with Terry Bradshaw. No other travel program can offer something like that\".\n\nBut what if you\u2019re unable to bid on a moment?\n\nYou can check out Marriott Bonvoy Tours & Activities \u2013 available to everyone, offering more than 200 000 options across more than 100 countries around the world.\n\n\"These experiences are open to everyone and can be purchased with points and a credit card.
