Police reported that Immesberger, who was employed at The Woods Jupiter, had a blood alcohol content of .256, triple the state\u2019s legal limit.\n\nWoods and Herman were both named in the lawsuit that was filed by Immesberger\u2019s family. In June, Woods was dropped from the suit. On Friday, representation for Immesberger\u2019s family also dropped Herman from the civil suit.\n\nThe lawsuit sought a variety of fees, including for medical and funeral expenses. Herman served as general manager at The Woods Jupiter but left the restaurant in February, three months after Immesberger died.\n\nBarry Postman, attorney for Woods and Herman, said the lawsuit against the golfer\u2019s girlfriend was \u201cvoluntarily\u201d dropped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt has been clear from the beginning that neither should have been included in the suit despite the claims that they somehow contributed to the accident,\u201d Postman said in a statement obtained by FOX Business. \"While the untimely passing of a young man is tragic, the decision to over consume alcohol, take a significant amount of illegal drugs and then get behind the wheel of a car and drive at an excess high speed rests with Mr. Immesberger alone.\u201d\n\nIt was always going to be an uphill battle for Immesberger's family to prove that Woods, Herman and the restaurant were responsible in the death of their son. In Florida's \"Drug and Alcohol Defense\" law, a plaintiff can't collect if they are over the legal limit and 50 percent at fault.", "description": "Tiger Woods' girlfriend Erica Herman was dropped from the lawsuit of a drunk driver's family on Friday.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/Tiger-Woods.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
