Outside the Warriors organization people may be doubts about the fit (*raises hand*), and those people also may think the Warriors gave Russell a four-year, $117.3 million contract in order to trade him for players who are a better fit. The Warriors say no, they are going to give this a legitimate chance to work.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIf you want more evidence of that, check out this note from Ethan Strauss of The Athletic:\n\nThere\u2019s a strong possibility that the Warriors actually want their newest big acquisition for seasons beyond this one. Their front-office leaders, Joe Lacob and Bob Myers both, are as smitten with him as any team that just selected a top-5 player in the draft. Myers has heard the assessments of his trade and they appear to grate on him\u2026 After doing a little digging, I\u2019ve come to buy the Warriors front office on this one. I believe that the Warriors\u2019 public messaging actually matches their private beliefs. While it\u2019s nice to retain the \u201coptionality\u201d that comes with signing a 23-year-old max player, I don\u2019t think that he was primarily acquired for his trade value. The front office\u2019s first hope is that Russell flourishes alongside Curry and becomes a foundational piece.\n\nThe Warriors are not saying they don\u2019t want to trade him to make sure they have leverage, this is what they believe. They want this to work and are all in on the idea.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t, well, he\u2019s a nice trade piece. But that\u2019s not what the Warriors are thinking heading into the season.", "description": "The Warriors aren't just giving lip service to keeping Russell.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BkWvDs9ogg.W_vGewv9LIw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNzQ7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vRw.nNSuSOwcqmTrPssPWQ--~B/aD0zNjA7dz02Mzc7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/d14a7c79beecc1af83aa18091631c954"}
