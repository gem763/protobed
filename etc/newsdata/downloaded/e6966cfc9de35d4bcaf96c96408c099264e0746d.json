Their relationship made waves after Petty's criminal history came to light.\n\nPetty is a registered, Level 2 sex offender on New York State\u2019s Sex Offender Registry. He was assessed as posing a medium risk of committing another offense.\n\nAccording to the registry, in April 1995, Petty was convicted of attempted first-degree rape for a 1994 assault that occurred when both he and the victim were 16. It also notes that he used a knife or cutting instrument during the commission of the crime. He was sentenced to between 18 and 54 months in state prison. According to New York State Department of Corrections records, he served just under four years and was released in January of 1999.\n\nThe DOC website says that in 2006, Petty went back to prison for first-degree manslaughter and served nearly seven years before being released on parole in May 2013.\n\nMore: Nicki Minaj goes Instagram-official with registered sex offender Kenneth Petty\n\nWhen an Instagram commenter noted that he would have been a teenager at the time of the attempted rape and speculated the victim \"must've been a white girl,\" Minaj reportedly offered clarification, stating, \"He was 15, she was 16... in a relationship. But go awf Internet. y'all can't run my life. Y'all can't even run y'all own life. Thank you boo.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Minaj called Petty the \"Clyde to my Bonnie.\" She updated her Twitter account to read \"Mrs. Petty.\"\n\nContributing: Erin Jensen\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/22/nicki-minaj-marries-kenneth-petty-after-year-dating/4060242002/", "description": "Barbie has her Ken!
