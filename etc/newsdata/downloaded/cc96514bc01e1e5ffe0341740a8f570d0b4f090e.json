Mr Clements has faced questions at a corruption hearing on Friday over a $100,000 donation allegedly delivered to Labor Party headquarters in an Aldi shopping bag in 2015. He said he doesn't believe the billionaire at the centre of the donation scandal was trying to influence Mr Shorten. In an exchange with Labor official Kenrick Cheah's lawyer, Mr Clements denied an Aldi bag containing the money was ever handed to him. \u201cThe bag didn't exist, there was no quid pro quo,\u201d he said. Mr Clements said he's relieved the grilling is over, but he could still be recalled when hearings resume in December. He admits changes need to be made to the political donation system.
