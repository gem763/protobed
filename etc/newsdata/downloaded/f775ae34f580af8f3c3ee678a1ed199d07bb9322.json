Providing better quality and more intensive public education for children, especially from poor and at-risk backgrounds, that lasts from age 3 through third grade.\n\nResearch conducted on a unique long-term data set from some of Chicago\u2019s most-challenged neighborhoods has found that four to six years of educational interventions in a child\u2019s life ended up producing enormous benefits by the time the children made it into early adulthood.\n\nTheir average incomes were a remarkable 25% higher than peers who didn\u2019t get the intervention. They were 30% more likely to earn more than a basic $20,415 threshold. They were 50% more likely to make it into the top 25% of earners, and less likely to end up in deep poverty.\n\nThe biggest gains were seen among those who had been growing up in circumstances that were most at risk.\n\nSome 62% said they were better off than their parents.\n\nThe findings, conducted by psychologists Arthur Reynolds, Suh-Ruu Ou, Christina Mondi and Alison Giovanelli at the University of Minnesota, are being published in the journal \u201cAmerican Psychologist.\u201d\n\nThe study looked at the CPC P-3 program, which stands for Child-Parent Center Preschool-to-Third Grade. The researchers looked at 1,329 former students who were born in 1979 and 1980, including 553 who benefited from four or more years in the program, and looked at where they had ended up 30 years later.\n\nResearchers examined the program\u2019s impact in 20 Chicago public schools in the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. Some 93% of the pupils were African-American and the remainder were Hispanic.\n\nThe program \u201chad smaller classes, more intensive and active learning for students, and family outreach and workshops for parents,\u201d Reynolds told MarketWatch. It also included GED classes. All teachers had bachelor\u2019s degrees, each class had a teaching assistant, and a leadership team ran the program in each school.\n\nThe cost? About $2,000 extra per pupil a year.\n\nThe U.S. Census says there are about 24 million children in the U.S. aged 3 to 8, so the annual cost would be a maximum of $50 billion a year \u2014 which sounds like a lot, until you look at the annual cost of dealing with poverty.\n\nCritically, the benefits came from keeping the children in the program for four to six years. Just intervening at the preschool level didn\u2019t work nearly as well. Children from poor and at-risk backgrounds benefited so long as they got at least four years of the program.\n\nIt is more than 50 years since the federal government launched early intervention programs such as Head Start as part of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s \u201cWar On Poverty.\u201d Debate has raged about what has worked, what hasn\u2019t, and why.\n\nThe programs have now been around long enough to analyze long-term outcomes: Not merely whether a program helped children have better reading levels at age 12, or jobs at 18, but how they fare well into middle age. The latest study is a case in point.\n\nIt is already known that early interventions can have big effects. Those who are behind by the time they make it to school have trouble catching up, experts have found. The latest study, however, shows that it\u2019s not enough to improve pre-kindergarten education or to intervene for one or two years. However, what is remarkable is that just four to six years \u2014 a drop in the bucket compared with a lifetime \u2014 is enough to make huge chances in life chances.\n\nFor everyone else, that also means more people able to help pay taxes, and fewer people on welfare. Which compares favorably with a poverty burden that is nearly $1 trillion a year.", "description": "And it would end up saving taxpayers a bundle, too.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT093_arends_ZG_20191010145012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
