He got kicked out of the Navy, all of a sudden he's getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a pay off,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I think [Joe] Biden is going down and I think his whole situation, because now you may very well find that there are many other countries that they scammed, just like they scammed China and Ukraine. And basically who are they really scamming? The USA. And it's not good. And that's probably why China for so many years has had a sweetheart deal where China rips off the USA because they deal with people like Biden where they give the son a billion and a half dollars, and that's probably why China has such a sweetheart deal that for so many years they've been ripping off our country,\" he continued.\n\nPresident Trump: \"China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine. So, I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.\" pic.twitter.com/Xia8vLUVT2 \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) October 3, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, the claims of Biden corruption in Ukraine aren't going over well with voters...and former Vice President Joe Biden should be worried.\n\nThis result from Monmouth poll should scare the pants off the Biden campaign -- or *whomever* becomes the Dem nominee.\n\n\n\nDespite all of the fact-checks, the no evidence of wrongdoing, the fact that Ukraine prosecutor's investigation was already dormant... https://t.co/qKXCUTgAXU pic.twitter.com/owzqnrvgdH \u2014 Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) October 2, 2019\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s read the massive, fascinating @NewYorker feature from July, \u201cWill Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Father\u2019s Campaign?\u201d you know the real story isn\u2019t Ukraine, it\u2019s China.
