While Harbhajan Singh has nor played since 2015 and at 39 is hardly expected to get a Test call, he is yet to retire so very much on the active list.\n\nDon't Miss 476 SHARES 274 SHARES 4.7 K SHARES 157 SHARES 57.7 K SHARES\n\nMuralitharan's record of 800 scalps looks safe for years to come. The closest to him among active players is James Anderson with 575. But Anderson is 37 and nearing the end of his career. Stuart Broad has 467 but at 33 is not going to be around for too long either. Ashwin might break into the 500 club and if he really pushes it 600 but that is it. He may finish his career in the top 5 but getting to the top is far-fetched.\n\nOf course no doubt one day someone will break Muralitharan's record. But until that day comes, he is number one. Ashwin may be a contender, but that is all he is at the moment, a contender. Only time will tell if he gets close, let alone go past the legend.", "description": "Ashwin's return to the Test side saw him draw level with Muttiah Muralitharan for the fastest to 350 wickets.
