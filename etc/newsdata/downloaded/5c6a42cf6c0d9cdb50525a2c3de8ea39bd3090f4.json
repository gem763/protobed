The cause of the fire is not yet known and no injuries have been reported.\n\nThe fire was under control at 06:30 but crews will remain there during the day.\n\nImage copyright London Fire Brigade Image caption London Fire Brigade described it as a \"challenging\" blaze to tackle\n\nDean Fowler, who lives with his family on the top floor of the building, said he was woken in the night by someone banging on his door.\n\n\"I then heard someone screaming 'there's a fire, get out', and I just got my boys and went,\" he said.\n\nHe added he had only been living in the building for three weeks and had lost \"everything\" in the blaze, but \"we're alive, we're breathing, that's all that matters\".\n\nThe building is made up of 23 flats and based in The Hamptons estate, which was built on a former sewage treatment works.\n\nResidents from the block as well as other surrounding buildings have been taken to a nearby community centre.\n\nOne of those, Darren Nicholson, said he woke up to the sound of \"crackling\" and when he opened the curtains he \"saw the flames and got myself and the family out\".\n\nHe said fire alarms were going off in the community areas but not in his own flat and he believed the blaze began \"on the balconies\".\n\nBBC Radio London correspondent Greg McKenzie said white smoke was still \"billowing\" from the building which had been left as a \"shell\".\n\nImage copyright London Fire Brigade Image caption No injuries have been reported\n\nGraham Adams, from London Fire Brigade, said: \"This is a challenging fire and firefighters are working hard to bring the blaze under control.\n\n\"Firefighters will remain on scene for a number of hours and we would urge people to avoid the area if possible.\"\n\nLondon Ambulance Service said: \"We have not treated any patients, however we remain on the scene as a precaution.\"\n\nHave you been affected by the Worcester Park fire?
