It was a raucous tribute to the Saracens lock who was bestriding another grand occasion. It felt like Wellington back in 2017, when the Lions condemned the All Blacks to their first home Test defeat in eight years and the same song had drawn the same response.\n\nDifferent shirt, different team, different city, but the same acclaim for similarly impressive feats. Itoje was outstanding for the Lions and here he was outstanding for England. Again. He was named Man of the Match and he will add that prize to a vast collection.\n\nMaro Itoje was incredible for England as they beat New Zealand 19-7 in World Cup semi-finals\n\nThe second row put in an incredible performance to help England reach the World Cup final\n\nItoje warned the All Blacks that 'trouble was coming' a couple days before the semi-final clash\n\nAfter talking the talk, he emphatically walked the walk. Itoje had warned the All Blacks that there was trouble coming. Speaking two days before this astonishing World Cup semi-final, the 24-year-old had conveyed a mood of laid-back confidence. His relaxed body language somehow jarred with his statement of intent.\n\nWhen asked about his Lions experience had taught him, Itoje bullishly declared: 'I learned a lot about New Zealand, their culture, how they play the game, how good and clinical they are - and how to get them. This weekend feels like the time we're going to get them.\n\n'The way I see New Zealand; I respect what they have done but I don't see them as a team that is going to beat us on Saturday. They are a very good team and they have the capacity to do some very dangerous things, but I still believe that if we play our best rugby, we will win.'\n\nItoje delivered an epic, all-action performance in attack and defence - he was dominant\n\nHe backed up his words emphatically. His confidence proved to be so well founded. Itoje delivered an epic, all-action performance in attack and defence. He was a dominant figure in a dominant team.\n\nSince his rise to international prominence, there have often been comparisons with the great Brodie Retallick - the leading Kiwi second row, but in this match the Englishman eclipsed his rival.\n\nWith George Kruis starting among the replacements, Itoje was charged with running the lineout. There was so much scrutiny on that crucial area, as the All Blacks had picked Scott Barrett in their back row, to ensure they had multiple jumping options.\n\nThey hoped to disrupt and overwhelm Eddie Jones' side in that aerial contest, as they had done last November at Twickenham. That ambition soon went up in smoke.\n\nThe lock is likely to be the poster-boy if England succeed in winning the World Cup next week\n\nFirst Courtney Lawes and then Itoje stole New Zealand throws. Later, Kieran Read pinched one back, but by then it was already obvious that Steve Hansen's selection strategy had back-fired. Sam Cane's arrival straight after half-time was a tacit admission that the ploy had failed.\n\nItoje was everywhere. He made his presence felt as a ball-carrier and he was also an asset at the breakdown, disrupting the All Blacks and competing effectively for possession.\n\nHe joined Tom Curry and Sam Underhill in leading a ruck rout. Itoje made several powerful tackles, with one especially eye-catching hit on Sam Whitelock late in the game.\n\nMaro Itoje won the Player of the Match award in Yokahoma to end a great day's work\n\nOn top of all the stirring physical deeds, he just showed his nous and awareness too. As with so many top players, Itoje seemed to instinctively read and adapt to the flow of the match. Time and again, when the ball went loose, he was on hand to seize it, or if a team-mate found space, he was up in support.\n\nThere were no histrionics from him either. Itoje is known as a player who enjoys antagonising the opposition, but he wasn't in wind-up mode this time. He just stayed focused on maintaining his relentless efforts.\n\nThis result and this performance maintains remarkable levels of early-career success. There have already been so many titles and glorious peaks with club and country, but the greatest of all now lies just a week and one game away.\n\nIf England complete their quest on November 2, Itoje is likely to emerge as the poster-boy, just as Jonny Wilkinson was in 2003.\n\n\n\n", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN YOKOHAMA: After talking the talk, he emphatically walked the walk.
