In the case of The Americans by Robert Frank (who died last week, aged 94) this is surprisingly simple. All you have to do is look at the pictures. Even now, more than 60 years later, many of the pictures in the most influential photography book of the postwar period remain hard to fathom. Several of them were shot through windows, but prior ideas of framing and focus had been thrown out of the window.\n\nThe irony is that the person who had defined what American photographs should look like, Walker Evans, was one of Frank\u2019s supporters; he recommended him for the Guggenheim fellowship that financed the road trip during which Frank took the thousands of images later edited down to the 83 printed in The Americans.\n\nThe book\u2019s inarticulate power to unsettle was nicely articulated by Diane Arbus in 1971: \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 a kind of hollowness in his work. I don\u2019t mean hollow like meaningless\u2026 I mean his pictures always involve a kind of non-drama... a drama in which the centre is removed. There\u2019s a kind of question mark at the hollow centre of the sort of storm of them, a curious existential kind of awe, it hit a whole generation of photographers terribly hard, like they\u2019d never seen that before.\u201d\n\nOne of these photographers was Arbus\u2019s friend Garry Winogrand, who felt compelled to follow Frank\u2019s example and document his own journey across America. This picture exercised a particular fascination for him and it\u2019s easy (in the sense, also, of rather difficult) to see why. What made Frank choose this moment \u2013 a moment that isn\u2019t even a moment? What makes it a picture? What\u2019s it a picture of exactly? The photographs in The Americans ask these questions so insistently \u2013 in an almost inaudible mumble \u2013 that we continue to lean forward, attending to them more closely.", "description": "Geoff Dyer on the influential American photographer who died last Monday aged 94", "authors": ["Geoff Dyer"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57a2042867f35ed4402545c06561b8d2a2767d7d/0_116_5136_3083/master/5136.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7e27fcec75ff334b5558585dd5f7ab6", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
