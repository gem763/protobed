(King later apologized, saying he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the content of the tweets.) Busch confirmed to Fox News that it had later donated over $920,000 to match the contributions raised by King, and that the Busch Light distributors of Iowa had also chipped in.\n\nApproximately 10 days after he appeared on \u201cCollege Gameday,\u201d Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds also announced that Saturday, Sept. 28, 2019, was to be known as \"Carson King Day\" in the midwestern state.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nOn Friday, King was finally able to donate the money, presenting a huge check for $3,004,202.14 to the hospital.\n\n\u201cSpeechless,\u201d King wrote in a Twitter post along with a photo of himself and the check.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe donations solicited by King won\u2019t stop there, though. Last week, King was approached by the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum, which wanted to begin selling a \u201cCarson King\u201d bobblehead and inquired about a partnership. King was surprised, but turned down any offer to profit from the dolls.\n\n\u201cWe offered to split it however you want,\u201d said Phil Sklar, the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum co-founder and CEO, in a statement to Iowa\u2019s Gazette. \u201cHe wants it all to go to the hospital.\u201d", "description": "Carson King is making good on his promise.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/21/694940094001_6088310847001_6088307134001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
