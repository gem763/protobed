The 39-year-old Miller was terrific after being slotted in for starter John Gibson on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nPierre-Luc Dubois scored for Columbus, and Joonas Korpisalo had 22 saves.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, Silverberg got a short-handed goal when he put back a rebound to cap an odd-man rush that was set up by a deflection off an official\u2019s skate. Fowler scored two minutes later, taking a drop pass from Ondrej Kase and beating Korpisalo from the right circle.\n\nDubois made it a one-goal game late in the second when he tore down the left side and delivered a sharp-angle shot that went in off Miller\u2019s arm.\n\nColumbus pulled the goalie with two minutes remaining, but managed only two shots with the man advantage.\n\nNOTES: Columbus put F Josh Anderson on injured reserve and recalled Markus Hannikainen from Cleveland of the American Hockey League. \u2026 Anaheim F Ryan Getzlaf played in his 989th game, becoming the Ducks\u2019 all-time games-played leader. The 34-year-old passed Corey Perry, who played 988 games in 14 seasons with Anaheim. \u2026 Ducks D Brendan Guhle was out with a lower-body injury. \u2026 Anaheim has killed 15 of 16 penalties this season, including three against Columbus. \u2026 The Ducks have failed to score a goal in 10 power-play chances.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nDucks: At Boston on Monday.\n\nBlue Jackets: At Carolina on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ryan Miller had 26 saves in his first start of the season, lifting the Anaheim Ducks to a 2-1 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mitch Stacy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/ducks_blue_jackets_hockey_53633_c0-278-2859-1945_s1200x700.jpg?f5f66bdea73dd82d7145019eeaea0c251aed5383", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
