The conversion would have gotten the Ravens (2-1) within a field goal, but Jackson was shoved out of bounds short of the pylon.\n\nBaltimore tried to get the ball back with a rare dropkick, but the Chiefs calmly called for a fair catch. Then they converted on third down moments later to run out the clock.\n\nMark Ingram was the Ravens\u2019 biggest bright spot, running for 103 yards and a trio of touchdowns while catching four passes for 32 yards. Jackson finished with 267 yards passing and 46 rushing, most of that when he was trying to rally the Ravens from a big halftime hole.\n\nThe Chiefs scored four times in the second quarter for the second consecutive week, this time getting three touchdowns and Harrison Butker\u2019s 42-yard field goal to take a 23-6 lead. They scored four TDs in the second quarter last week in Oakland .\n\nThe Ravens actually scored first on Ingram\u2019s touchdown plunge, then they took points off the board when a penalty gave them a shorter try at the conversion. Jackson was stuffed at the goal line in what would become a recurring theme for Baltimore all afternoon.\n\nMcCoy, hobbled by a sore ankle all week, gave Kansas City the lead with a touchdown run early in the second quarter. Then, after the Ravens\u2019 turnover on downs, Mahomes lofted a pass to the corner of the end zone that Robinson caught with an incredible one-handed stab .\n\nThat highlight was joined by another on the Chiefs\u2019 next possession, when the Ravens blew the coverage and Mecole Hardman was open downfield. The rookie hauled in the heave from Mahomes, then used his 4.3-second 40-yard-dash speed to sprint 83 yards to the end zone.\n\nIngram sandwiched two more touchdown runs around Mahomes\u2019 third touchdown toss in the second half, and the second one got Baltimore within 30-19 with 12:22 to go. But the Ravens again tried for the 2-point conversion and again came up empty, leaving them in an 11-point hole.\n\nThat could have loomed large when Justin Tucker added a field goal. Instead, Williams ripped off a 41-yard run, the Chiefs picked up a couple more first downs, and Butker hit a 36-yard field goal that ultimately put the game out of reach.\n\nINJURIES\n\nRavens: CB Jimmy Smith (knee) and S Brynden Trawick (elbow) were inactive.\n\nChiefs: McCoy aggravated his sore ankle on his touchdown catch in the fourth quarter. WR Tyreek Hill (collarbone), RB Damien Williams (knee) and LT Eric Fisher (groin) were inactive.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBaltimore: returns home to face Cleveland next Sunday.\n\nKansas City: on the road for the third time in four weeks Sunday at Detroit.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs won a showdown between two of the NFL's top offenses.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/Ravens_Chiefs_Football_50779.jpg-1303c_c0-129-3101-1937_s1770x1032.jpg?3fc7d3a8715890b384b1377cd024a85ac35a9b63", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
