They represent the future of the club.\n\n\u201cI think this was our best performance since I came here. We stuck to our philosophy and we were able to combine the performance that we want with the result that we want.\u201d", "description": "Birmingham City 2 Middlesbrough 1", "authors": ["Jon Culley", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000212017487-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqterdOwC7njftddwmHEpu1MseDhaZp-92cNrhFwOJEmY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
