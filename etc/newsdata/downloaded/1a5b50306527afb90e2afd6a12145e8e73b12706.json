We can see why: It has a delicate citrus flavor and a tender crumb that holds together well enough to not mar a beautiful dress. It may remind you of a lightened-up pound cake.\n\nDusting the pan with sugar instead of flour gives a slightly crunchy exterior. Feel free to swap in orange or lime zest for the lemon.\n\nScale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here.\n\nIngredients\n\n3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (170 grams) sugar, plus more for the pan\n\n1 cup (125 grams) flour\n\nFinely grated lemon zest from 1 large lemon (about 1 tablespoon)\n\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n\n3 large eggs\n\n8 tablespoons (1 stick/113 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more, at room temperature, for the pan\n\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees with the rack in the middle. Grease an 8 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan, then lightly coat with sugar, tapping out the excess.\n\nDid you make this recipe?

Beat the eggs in the bowl of a stand mixer or handheld electric mixer on medium-high speed, until thick, pale yellow and creamy, 3 to 5 minutes. Gradually beat in the sugar until thoroughly combined, followed by the melted butter and vanilla. Carefully fold in the flour mixture just until combined, taking care not to deflate the egg mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.\n\n[\u2018Downton Abbey\u2019 is back. The movie based on the British soap is an overstuffed guilty pleasure.]\n\nStep 3\n\nGet the pan into the oven quickly, before the eggs have a chance to collapse. Bake for about 35 minutes, until the top of the cake is a rich golden brown and the sides have just started pulling away from the pan. (The cake will not rise to the top of the pan.) A skewer inserted into the center of the cake should come out clean.\n\nStep 4\n\nLet cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then carefully turn the cake out onto the rack (a round-edge knife can help loosen it, if necessary), turn the cake upright and let cool completely before serving.\n\nAdapted from \u201cThe Official Downton Abbey Cookbook\u201d by Annie Gray (Weldon Owen, 2019).\n\nTested by Becky Krystal; email questions to voraciously@washpost.com.\n\nScale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here.\n\nDid you make this recipe?
