REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo\n\nRelations between Renault, which named its finance director as temporary CEO, and Nissan, which picked a new CEO on Tuesday, have been strained since Ghosn\u2019s arrest in Tokyo last year on allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies.\n\nBollore, who had long been Ghosn\u2019s right-hand man, was promoted to help steady Renault this year, with Jean-Dominique Senard hired from Michelin as chairman.\n\nBut Bollore had had an uneasy relationship with Nissan, according to sources familiar with the matter, and Renault and the French state, its key shareholder, have repeatedly emphasized their wish to repair ties and reinforce the alliance.\n\nTensions between the partners were further inflamed this year, including during various spats over governance reforms, and after a failed deal under Senard\u2019s watch to pair Renault up with Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI), which withdrew a merger offer.\n\nRenault said on Friday that financial director Clotilde Delbos would take over Bollore\u2019s job on an interim basis.\n\n\u201cThe board of directors decided to end the mandate of Mr Thierry Bollore as Chief Executive Officer of Renault ... with immediate effect,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nRenault shares were up 4.2% at 1030 GMT.\n\n\u2018COUP DE FORCE\u2019\n\nBollore denounced his looming exit as a \u201ccoup\u201d in a newspaper interview on Thursday evening, after news that Senard was poised to trigger his departure had emerged in the French press on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe brutality and the totally unexpected character of what is happening are stupefying ... This coup de force is very worrying,\u201d Bollore told Les Echos.\n\nRenault also named two deputies to back up Delbos: top sales executive Olivier Murguet and a senior manufacturing and supply chain chief, Jose-Vicente de los Mozos.\n\nThe triumvirate has echoes of the new top team announced on Tuesday by Nissan.\n\nNissan picked Makoto Uchida, previously the head of its Chinese business, to replace Hiroto Saikawa, who stepped down as CEO in September after he admitted to being improperly overpaid.\n\nUchida is known for close ties to Renault, which could help ease tensions in the alliance.\n\nSaikawa and Bollore barely spoke and were seen as clear irritants to the relationship between Nissan and Renault, French official and company sources told Reuters in June.\n\nBefore his ouster, Ghosn had been working on a plan for a full merger of Renault and Nissan, but had met resistance in Japan, which is concerned about French government influence in the alliance.\n\nThe French government, which holds a 15% stake in Renault, expressed its support for Senard on Thursday after Bollore hit out at the company, saying it trusted the chairman to submit the \u201cnecessary decisions\u201d to the board.", "description": "Renault's board voted on Friday to oust chief executive Thierry Bollore, as the French carmaker and Japanese partner Nissan <7201.T> seek a fresh start following the scandal-hit tenure of former alliance supremo Carlos Ghosn.", "authors": ["Gilles Guillaume", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439638185&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0OQ-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
