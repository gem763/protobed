They said that it would affect a greater number of people if nuts wouldn't be served.\n\n'There was a lot of fuss, I was very upset by the end I must say and then having to just walk away was awful. It was very distressing trying to explain everything.'\n\nMiss Williams, from Hendy in Carmarthenshire, was due to fly on the two and a half hour flight costing \u00a3200 to Esquel in Patagonia.\n\nBut she instead had a 26-hour bus journey to go the 1,150 miles to reach the school.\n\nThe Cardiff University student - who was due to start volunteering at a primary school 1,100 miles away - was left 'shocked' by the ban.
