USA TODAY\n\nOne of the most underrated aspects of college football is how dramatically and unexpectedly the pretenders reveal themselves. When you looked at Wisconsin\u2019s schedule this year, particularly the way the Badgers played in the early part of the season, you only saw one probable loss \u2013 next Saturday at Ohio State \u2013 before the Big Ten championship game.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t even take that long to expose No. 6 Wisconsin as a complete fraud of a national title contender.\n\nNobody could have foreseen Saturday\u2019s trip to Illinois as a loss, or even a particularly dangerous game for a Wisconsin team that had recorded four shutouts this season and was allowing just 3.06 yards per play, by far the best in the country. And yet, whether it was Wisconsin looking ahead to the Ohio State game or not taking the Illini seriously enough or flat-out not executing the way it had in previous games, the Badgers were just sloppy enough to let Illinois hang around and eventually win on James McCourt\u2019s 39-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nIt seems like a rather obvious point to make, but this is just a devastating loss for Wisconsin and takes a ton of steam out of next week\u2019s Big Ten showcase game. Sure, you can make a case for how the Badgers get back into the College Football Playoff race if they somehow rebound in Columbus, but losing to an Illinois team that was 0-3 in the Big Ten casts their whole season in a different light.\n\nAnd Wisconsin certainly had plenty of chances to put the game away. Up 20-7, the Badgers missed a 37-yard field goal that would have added to the lead and turned it over on their final two possessions, including a Jonathan Taylor fumble with 7:12 left when the Badgers were leading by nine points and driving deep in Illinois territory.\n\nWisconsin quarterback Jack Coan throws an incomplete pass as Illinois defensive lineman Tymir Oliver pressures him during the second quarter.

The presumption was that Wisconsin would lose to Ohio State and then have a rematch in the championship game with a potential Playoff berth on the line. Now, the best thing for the Big Ten might be to get on Minnesota\u2019s bandwagon. The Gophers are 7-0 after beating Rutgers on Saturday and will get both Penn State and Wisconsin at home later in the year, giving them a decent chance in theory of going unbeaten in the regular season. But as we learned in Champaign on Saturday, nothing\u2019s a given.\n\nWinners and losers: Week 8 led by Wisconsin, Oregon\n\nMore: Wisconsin got what it deserved in loss to Illinois\n\nHere are nine other observations from Week 8 in college football:\n\nThe Pac-12 is still alive for the Playoff\n\nOregon\u2019s 35-31 win at No. 23 Washington was arguably the most significant result for the Pac-12 in the last couple seasons. Though there are no guarantees about what happens going forward, the 12th-ranked Ducks surviving a trip to Seattle sets them up very nicely to win the Pac-12 title and keeps them very much in the hunt for a CFP bid.\n\nThough Oregon is still on the outside looking in at this point because of that season-opening loss to Auburn, it has been proven that a one-loss Power Five conference champion is in the hunt. If Oregon can somehow win six more \u2013 its toughest tests would appear to be at Southern Cal on Nov. 2, at No. 17 Arizona State on Nov. 23 and the Pac-12 championship game against perhaps No. 14 Utah \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t take too much chaos for the Ducks to sneak in.\n\nMore: Oregon stays in the College Football Playoff mix after road defeat of Washington\n\nHey, it\u2019s certainly a lot better situation for the Pac-12 than what it appeared early in the third quarter when Oregon trailed 28-14. But the Ducks really got their running game going in the second half and put together touchdown drives of 79, 75 and 70 yards to take the lead.\n\nWashington quarterback Jacob Eason, who outplayed his counterpart Justin Herbert by completing 23-of-30 for 289 yards and three touchdowns, made one critical mistake late in the game when he took a sack on second-and-6 with two minutes left after crossing midfield. Oregon\u2019s defense was able to hold the next two plays and wrap up the biggest win of Mario Cristobal\u2019s career.\n\nMichigan didn\u2019t quit, but that\u2019s not worth much\n\nGiven their history of flopping in big road games under Jim Harbaugh, it would have been easy for Michigan to tuck tail after falling behind 21-0 early in Happy Valley. But give the Wolverines some credit for a gutty performance to get back in the game and have a chance to tie it late.\n\nUnfortunately, though, it doesn\u2019t change the reality or the narrative of Michigan football after a 28-21 loss to Penn State: Harbaugh just doesn\u2019t beat the good teams often enough, and he\u2019s never done it as an underdog. Maybe Michigan\u2019s second half is something to build on, as it forced five straight punts spanning the second and third quarter to get back in the game. Quarterback Shea Patterson was pretty effective, completing 24-of-41 passes for 276 yards. But at the end of the day, Penn State receiver K.J. Hamler made a couple big, winning plays in the second half while Michigan receiver Ronnie Bell flat-out dropped the tying touchdown on fourth-and-goal with 2:01 remaining.\n\nHamler, who grew up in Pontiac, Mich., and finished his high school career at IMG Academy where Harbaugh has worked hard to build recruiting inroads, torched Michigan for 108 receiving yards on six catches, including a 53-yard touchdown with 13:14 remaining. He also drove through the Michigan defense for four crucial yards and a first down that allowed Penn State to run out the clock.\n\nWhy Michigan doesn\u2019t make those plays and its opponents do in key moments is something we can\u2019t know the answer to, but it keeps happening. And now, the Wolverines\u2019 season is effectively over in terms of championship potential while 7-0 Penn State keeps motoring toward a Nov. 23 showdown with Ohio State in Columbus.\n\nTrevor Lawrence\u2019s season continues to be weird\n\nIn the end, there were no issues for No. 2 Clemson in a 45-10 win at Louisville, but star quarterback Trevor Lawrence is still making some head-scratching throws and decisions for a guy who played so flawlessly as a freshman late last season.\n\nLawrence pretty much single-handedly allowed Louisville to hang around for the first half by throwing back-to-back interceptions on Clemson\u2019s second and third series \u2013 the seventh and eighth time he\u2019s been picked off this year. The first one was off the hands of the receiver, but only because Lawrence fired high on a short underneath throw. On the second interception, Lawrence just didn\u2019t seem to read Louisville dropping the safety into coverage.\n\nMore: Clemson player ejected after throwing punch at Louisville player after scrap\n\nEventually, he got on track and finished with 233 passing yards and three touchdowns on 20-of-29 completions. Still, for a player who threw just four interceptions last year, it will be costly for Clemson later in the year if he continues to make those mistakes.\n\nMatt Rhule could be national coach of the year\n\nThe rebuilding job at Baylor continues to astound, and with the Bears now standing at 7-0 you have to consider Matt Rhule as a strong contender if not the favorite to be national coach of the year. Baylor impressively finished off Oklahoma State in Stillwater, 45-27, but sometimes it\u2019s worth stepping back and considering the big picture.\n\nThe state of Baylor football when Rhule took the job at the end of 2016 was almost difficult to imagine. The roster was in shambles after the drawn-out sexual assault scandal that took down Art Briles and much of the school\u2019s administration. Recruiting had obviously paused for many months, leaving Rhule way behind the competition. And maybe more than anything else, the whole morale of the place was bad because Briles won big there and a lot of people around Baylor felt like it was all over the day he was shoved out the door.\n\nBut Rhule has transformed Baylor football in just three years. It\u2019s not all about offense now; the Bears play sound, physical football on defense and they\u2019re getting opportunistic play from quarterback Charlie Brewer, who had 312 passing yards against Oklahoma State on just 17 attempts.\n\nThough insiders knew Rhule had the skill-set to take on a major rebuild after what he accomplished at Temple, nobody could have foreseen 7-0 in his third year. And Baylor will be heavily favored to be 9-0 on Nov. 16 when it hosts Oklahoma in a Game of the Decade-type environment in Waco.\n\nThe new extended overtime rule is gimmicky but \u2026 OK?\n\nAfter it took seven overtimes to decide Texas A&M-LSU last November (the Aggies won 74-72), a situation that brought up legitimate questions about player safety, the NCAA approved a rule change that would require teams after the fourth overtime to trade off two-point conversions until there\u2019s a winner.\n\nThe first application of that rule came in Virginia Tech\u2019s 43-41 win over North Carolina in a game that featured both teams missing field goals in the regular portion of overtime that would have ended it. In the fifth overtime, both teams failed to convert their two-point tries. Then, Virginia Tech got another stop on North Carolina quarterback Sam Howell and won the game when quarterback Quincy Patterson ran it in.\n\nThough this rule will only come into play on rare occasions, some fans will absolutely hate it (as well as gamblers, since an overtime game being decided by two points isn\u2019t point spread friendly). We don\u2019t end basketball games on free throw contests or golf tournaments on alternating five-foot putts. But as gimmicky as it might be, there was a certain drama to the importance of that one play. And once teams have played a certain number of snaps, maybe it\u2019s better to just end it on something like this. But it does beg the question: Why do you have to have a winner at all? We had ties in college football forever before overtime, and if there isn\u2019t a winning team after four overtimes, why not just call it a tie?\n\nWill Muschamp had a right to be mad\n\nSouth Carolina coach Will Muschamp had a heated exchange with officials during a 38-27 loss to No. 9 Florida, some of which was captured by ESPN\u2019s cameras. Eventually, Muschamp got a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct and complained after the game that the official \u201cran 40 yards away\u201d from him before throwing the flag.\n\nSouth Carolina head coach Will Muschamp argues a call during the game against Florida. (Photo: Mic Smith, AP)\n\n\u201cDrop it on my feet next time,\u201d Muschamp said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment about anything else. Don\u2019t go 40 yards away and drop a flag. How \u2018bout that?\u201d\n\nThen, after he paused for a beat, Muschamp uttered the word \u201cgutless\u201d under his breath.\n\nTruth be told, Muschamp had every right to be furious with the calls on Saturday. The officiating crew appeared to miss two critical penalties on Florida, both of which would have wiped out touchdowns. Dameon Pierce\u2019s 75-yard touchdown run in the third quarter should have been negated because of early movement from the right tackle. On the second controversial touchdown, which extended Florida\u2019s lead to 31-20 with 7:53 left, Gators receiver Josh Hammond was pretty clearly committing an illegal pick as he was doing nothing on the play other than blocking a defensive back downfield to spring tight end Kyle Pitts open. Surely, an apology from the SEC office will soon be on the way.\n\nMiami stung by kicking disaster\n\nThings have been going poorly in the Hurricanes\u2019 first season under Manny Diaz, but it\u2019s hard to imagine a result that will feel worse than their 28-21 overtime loss to Georgia Tech as they missed 27-yard and 25-yard field goals in the fourth quarter that would have given them the lead.\n\nTwo different kickers contributed to the mess, as Bubba Baxa missed first and Turner Davidson, who also missed a 34-yarder in the first half, had his kick blocked with 26 seconds left to preserve Georgia Tech\u2019s chance at overtime.\n\nThis has been a season-long issue for Miami. Baxa, who made 75% of his field goals as a freshman, is just 5-for-10 on the season and has missed two extra points. Davidson kicked his first career field goal last week in a win over Virginia but obviously struggled against the Yellow Jackets, who came into the game 1-5 and had lost to all three of their ACC opponents by double digits.\n\nDiaz said both kickers had a good week of practice but had no immediate answers for a problem that is now as much mental as physical for the entire team.\n\n\u201cAll we know how to do is manage the situation and continue to coach the guys, give them all the psychological help we can afford them,\u201d Diaz told reporters. \u201cAnd as I said when this first became an issue, they are what we have. We don\u2019t have free agency and we just continue to press on.\u201d\n\nWill Arkansas be desperate enough to pull the Mike Leach lever?\n\nIf it were possible to boil a coaching tenure down to one play, it might be Arkansas\u2019s fake punt early in the second quarter after falling behind Auburn 17-0. In what may have been one of the worst-looking fakes in recent memory, punter Sam Loy appeared to attempt some type of chest pass to a player who was sprinting across the formation. Unfortunately for Arkansas, the pass was way too high and Auburn\u2019s Chandler Wooten stayed home to snag an interception and the whole thing looked rather ridiculous. As did the final score: Auburn 51, Arkansas 10.\n\nThings have gotten so bad at Arkansas that more and more college athletics insiders are wondering whether the school might just pull the plug on Chad Morris after two years and swallow his $10 million buyout on top of the roughly $3.8 million it will still be paying Bret Bielema through the rest of 2020.\n\nThat would be a ridiculous amount of money to pay coaches not to work, but Morris is now well on his way to a second consecutive winless season in the SEC. Of his four overall wins, two have been against FCS teams with Tulsa and Colorado State accounting for the others. At this point it\u2019s hard to imagine the reaction of Arkansas fans if Morris is brought back for a third year, and yet, most of the candidates who make sense in theory are either unproven or some variation of retread.\n\nThere is one, though, who might be an interesting match: Washington State\u2019s Mike Leach. Though most high-profile schools have stayed away from The Pirate because of his well-documented eccentricities and well-founded concerns that he\u2019ll say or tweet something embarrassing, Arkansas is the kind of place that might be desperate enough to give it a shot. From a recruiting standpoint, Arkansas is somewhat marginalized in the SEC the way Texas Tech was in the Big 12 and Washington State is in the Pac-12. Leach has won at both places, and if Arkansas makes a change, it\u2019s certainly something the administration there would have to consider. Leach has also mentioned Arkansas positively in the past, saying during one of his soliloquys in 2017 that War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock was the loudest visiting stadium he ever coached in.\n\nGeorgia State wasn\u2019t a fluke after all\n\nThe first time many college football fans heard the name Georgia State was in Week 1 of this season when the Panthers shocked Tennessee in Neyland Stadium, 38-30. After that, the Panthers predictably fell off the radar since they play in the Sun Belt Conference and aren\u2019t on television very much.\n\nBut they registered a second notable win Saturday, beating Army 28-21 to move to 5-2 on the season. Though Army clearly isn\u2019t as good of a team as it was last season, it\u2019s still a significant thing for a fledgling program like Georgia State to beat a name brand like Army. Quarterback Dan Ellington, who was excellent in that game against the Vols, completed 20-of-28 against Army for 232 yards and three touchdowns while Georgia State\u2019s defense was able to hang in there against the option and get a key interception with a minute left to seal the game.\n\nGeorgia State, which went 2-10 last season, is now poised to make a bowl game for the second time in program history. And because head coach Shawn Elliott has been determined to build the program with high school recruits rather than transfers, the Panthers have an opportunity to sustain a high-level Group of Five program in the talent-rich Atlanta area.", "description": "Wisconsin showed it was not a real national title contender with a loss to Illinois that changes the landscape of the Big Ten.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published A.M.
