Verlander will start Game 5 on Friday night against James Paxton.\n\nNFL\n\nDENVER (AP) - Now the wait begins to see how long it takes Patrick Mahomes to return from a gruesome right knee injury.\n\nWaiting in the wings, just in case: 35-year-old backup Matt Moore.\n\nMahomes, the MVP quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, was hurt on a second-quarter sneak in a 30-6 win over the Denver Broncos on Thursday night.\n\nKansas City coach Andy Reid doesn\u2019t yet know how long Mahomes may be sidelined as the Chiefs (5-2) snapped a two-game skid with Moore stepping in and the Chiefs defense stepping up (nine sacks and a defensive score).\n\nFacing fourth-and-short deep in Denver territory, Mahomes picked up a first down by sneaking through the line.\n\nAs the pile began to clear, Mahomes didn\u2019t jump up.\n\nStruggling to straighten his right knee, he tossed his helmet to the side and covered his face with both hands. His teammates immediately checked on him.\n\nNBA\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Chinese officials wanted Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey to be fired for his tweet supporting anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, and the league emphatically dismissed the request.\n\nSilver also said that the league is already feeling \u201csubstantial\u201d financial losses because of the Chinese reaction to Morey\u2019s deleted tweet.\n\n\u201cObviously, we made clear that we were being asked to fire him by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\u201d Silver said Thursday during an appearance at the Time 100 Health Summit in New York. \u201cWe said, \u2018There\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe league and LeBron James, one of its biggest stars, has been heavily criticized by some U.S. lawmakers for the perception that they caved to the Chinese regime. Morey has not been rebuked publicly by the league, and Silver has said that the league will support his freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make an absolute clear statement that the values of the NBA, these American values - we are an American business - travel with us wherever we go, and one of those values is free expression,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure everyone understood we were supporting free expression.\u201d\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Zion Williamson won\u2019t play in New York in the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 final preseason game because of a sore right knee.\n\nThe Pelicans said Thursday that the No. 1 pick didn\u2019t travel with the team to New York, remaining in New Orleans to undergo further testing and evaluation at Ochsner Sports Medicine.\n\nHe was to have played Friday night against former Duke teammate RJ Barrett, the No. 3 pick, in a nationally televised game.\n\nWilliamson has averaged 23.3 points on 71.4% shooting in four preseason games. The Pelicans said further updates will be provided when available.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Bradley Beal has agreed on a two-year extension worth nearly $72 million with Washington, a major victory for the Wizards and a move that will keep the All-Star guard out of free agency for at least the next three summers.\n\nThe agreement was confirmed Thursday by Beal\u2019s agent, Mark Bartelstein. ESPN first reported the details of the extension.\n\nBeal still had two years left on his existing contract. The extension kicks in for the 2021-22 season, has a player option for the following year and means that Beal won\u2019t be part of what has been shaping up to be an NBA free-agent extravaganza in the summer of 2021.\n\nThe Wizards were willing to give Beal a three-year extension that would have been worth about $111 million over three years. Beal went the two-year route and that protects his future options - he could opt out of the deal in the summer of 2022, coinciding with his 10th year in the league.\n\nNHL\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) - Vegas Golden Knights forward Valentin Zykov was suspended Thursday for 20 games without pay for a violation of the NHL\u2019s performance-enhancing substances program, the league said.\n\nThe suspension is accompanied by a referral to the league\u2019s program for Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health for evaluation and possible treatment. The league said it would have no further comment.\n\nThe Knights said the franchise respects the league\u2019s decision.\n\nNASCAR\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Clint Bowyer has reached an agreement with Stewart-Haas Racing to return to the No. 14 Ford next season.\n\nBowyer has been with SHR for three of his 15 seasons in the Cup Series. His extension announced Thursday came as the Kansas native headed to his home track on the verge of elimination from the playoffs.\n\nBowyer, from Emporia, Kansas, is 11th in the 12-driver playoff field going into Sunday\u2019s race at Kansas Speedway. The bottom four drivers in the standings will be eliminated after Kansas.\n\nCOURTS\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - An Atlanta businessman and former NBA referee was spared prison time Thursday after pleading guilty in a college basketball scandal that paid bribes to steer top athletes to certain schools and money managers.\n\nRashan Michel wiped his eyes when U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska in New York announced prison would be excessive punishment, even for what she described as a serious crime. She also ordered him to forfeit $24,000, the amount he was paid in the scheme.\n\nThe sentencing came in a case that exposed how fledgling money managers and representatives of sports apparel companies paid bribes to college coaches and families of top recruits to steer youngsters toward favored schools and handlers so they could cash in when the players reached the NBA.\n\nMichel was a full-time NBA referee from 1997 to 2001 and a part-time college referee from 2006 to 2017. He also founded and operated a clothing store that catered to pro athletes and traveled the country to meet his clients.\n\nOBITUARY\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) - Ed Beck, a fierce rebounder for Kentucky\u2019s 1958 NCAA championship team nicknamed the \u201cFiddlin\u2019 Five,\u201d has died. He was 83.\n\nThe school said Beck died Wednesday in Sun City, Arizona. A two-year captain for coach Adolph Rupp, Beck grabbed 11.6 boards per game with 5.6 points on the school\u2019s fourth title squad. Beck was named Southeastern Conference Defensive Player of the Year that season.\n\nAs a junior, Beck averaged 14.1 rebounds and 9.6 points to earn Associated Press All-SEC second team honors. His career average of 10 rebounds was Kentucky\u2019s third-highest total at the time.\n\nBeck\u2019s leadership in 1958 followed a personal loss with the offseason death of his first wife, Billie, from Hodgkin\u2019s disease. He turned down an offer from the NBA\u2019s New York Knicks after graduation to enter the ministry and served there for over 50 years.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "MLB", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
