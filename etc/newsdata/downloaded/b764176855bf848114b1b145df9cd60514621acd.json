Greg Abbott giving a press conference following the mass shooting in Odessa. Few sights make me sicker than watching Republican politicians after these massacres holding press conferences to reassure people that they\u2019ve got everything under control. No, dude. We have this situation in the first place in part because of people like you.\n\nLast month, at the time of the El Paso and Dayton shootings, I wrote a column in which I discussed Abbott, who had just signed 10 pro-gun bills into law. He signed these before the El Paso and Odessa tragedies, but as you may have read recently, they went into effect just after seven more bodies piled up in Odessa. My favorite is the one that prohibits \u201cno firearms\u201d clauses in residential leases, because the one thing we as a society most definitely need to do is to make it easier for people to rent apartments and fill them up with arsenals that rival that of a small country.\n\nSo here we are again. What are we to do? About places like Texas, not much. If anything, they\u2019re moving in the direction of arming school teachers.\n\nBut in Washington, the story is different. The mood has definitely changed, what with the continuing horrors and the National Rifle Association\u2019s recent controversies. I\u2019ve come to think it\u2019s possible to beat the NRA within maybe three or four election cycles. Doing so requires three elements. One, some anti-NRA Democrats beating some pro-gun Republicans in some high-profile races. Two, some Republicans turning against the NRA and living to tell the tale. I\u2019ll get to three later.\n\nOn the first point, there are some races to watch in next year\u2019s elections. The biggest and most obvious one is the Senate race in Arizona. The incumbent is Republican Martha McSally, whom the governor named to fill John McCain\u2019s term. The Democratic challenger is Mark Kelly, the ex-astronaut and husband of Gabrielle Giffords, the former House member who was shot in the head outside a supermarket in 2011.\n\nObviously, reining in guns is pretty central to his campaign. With his wife, he\u2019s the co-founder of a political action committee dedicated to trying to take down the most pro-gun Republicans. McSally got $227,000 from pro-gun lobbies in the 2018 cycle, making her the second-leading recipient of gun money that year. Over her career, according to opensecrets.org, the NRA has invested $300,000 in her. So little wonder that just three weeks ago, when asked by a constituent about mass shootings, she issued the brave reply: \u201cI believe in states\u2019 rights. Most problems can be solved at the state and local level.\u201d\n\nA Senate race in a large and complex state turns on many factors. But the gun issue will be central here for obvious reasons. Look for the NRA to up that investment considerably. If Kelly can win\u2014and right now, Kelly is at least tied and maybe has a slight edge\u2014that will be a big blow to the NRA in a state where it\u2019s controlled the senators for years (yes, St. John, too, for the most part).\n\nIn Iowa, Republican first-term incumbent Sen. Jodi Ernst is an NRA favorite. The group spent north of $3 million helping her win in 2014. The leading Democrat against her is Theresa Greenfield. From what I can see, she\u2019s not making a huge issue of guns so far, although she did post on her Facebook page on Aug. 10 about being \u201cmoved and grateful\u201d to be at an event put on by Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nThere are also a few House races where a Democrat might pick off an NRA-backed GOP incumbent. In Illinois\u2019 13th District, a rural district in the south-central part of the state that Cook rates R+3, Democrat Betsy Dirksen Londrigan is running to unseat Rodney Davis. He beat her by less than 1 percentage point in 2018.\n\nThere are a few others, I won\u2019t go into detail on them all. The point is this. If anti-NRA Democrats beat pro-NRA Republicans in just a handful of seats, especially in Republican-leaning districts, that\u2019s a big deal. It doesn\u2019t need to be 15 seats. It needs to be three or four. It needs to be shown that it can be done.\n\n\u201c If they can stare-down NRA-backed primaries and win that will show every Republican on the Hill that the NRA can be beaten. \u201d\n\nNow, element two. A number of Republicans have in fact cooled a bit on the NRA in recent years. The Trace overturned an impressive number of rocks before the 2018 election to discover that the NRA had downgraded its ratings of 15 Republicans that year (impressive because the NRA makes it hard to find these ratings). Ten of these 15 were in Congress.\n\nThe sharpest downgrades were in Florida, where after Parkland, a couple House members said basta. Brian Mast of Palm Beach went from an A to an F rating because he came out in favor of universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons. Carlos Curbelo of Miami went from B+ to F for similar reasons. (Even Rick Scott went from an A+ to a C post-Parkland).\n\nCurbelo lost in 2018, but Mast won. This year, Mast and seven other Republicans voted with the Democrats in late February to pass a background-check law. The other seven were: Vern Buchanan of Florida; Mario Diaz-Balart, also of Florida; Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania; Will Hurd of Texas; Peter King of New York; Chris Smith of New Jersey; and Fred Upton of Michigan.\n\nHurd is retiring, and others may. Of the ones who seek re-election, will they be primaried, and will the NRA back that primary opponent to the hilt? This is an absolutely crucial question. If they can stare-down NRA-backed primaries and win, even if it\u2019s just three or four of them, that will show every Republican on the Hill that the NRA can be beaten. And that is the exact moment when this poison will start to weaken.\n\nI mentioned a third element. I know this gets a bit ghoulish but let me put it this way. In the face of more murder sprees\u2014which, sad to say, we know will happen\u2014let the NRA continue its intransigence, carry on celebrating with each new state that allows people to tote semi-automatic guns into schools, churches, and airports. As they do, more Republicans like Mast and Curbelo will say they\u2019ve had it. And they\u2019ll turn against the NRA, and they\u2019ll survive. And one day, the power will be broken. It\u2019s sick that it\u2019s taken this many dead bodies and will take that many more. But it will happen, while Wayne LaPierre\u2019s hands are still alive and warm enough to feel the sting of it.", "description": "It\u2019s not enough for Democrats to beat Republicans.
