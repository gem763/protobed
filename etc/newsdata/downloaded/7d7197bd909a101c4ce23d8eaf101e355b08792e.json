They\u2019ve never been able to accept that he won.\n\nBecause of that, the American people have had to deal with things like the Russia collusion hoax and the Mueller probe, and now the Ukraine effort. Thanks Democrats, for constantly being divisive because you didn\u2019t get your own way.\n\nPerhaps the best example of this is the 2016 candidate, Hillary Clinton herself.\n\nShe just hasn\u2019t been able to deal with the loss and has been left to trying to poke at Trump on social media.\n\nShe tried this tweet attacking Trump which was completely lacking in self-awareness.\n\nIt's becoming a challenge to keep up with the high crimes and misdemeanors. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 10, 2019\n\nThat didn\u2019t go over well as she found out.\n\nThe best response was Donald Trump, Jr.\n\nTrue\u2026 You should really stop doing them. https://t.co/XK5klLaYMQ \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 11, 2019\n\nSome good follow-ups.\n\nIt\u2019s easier if you sing them \ud83c\udfb6 pic.twitter.com/Jea4twytMC \u2014 Rep. Steven Smith \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@RepStevenSmith) October 10, 2019\n\nBut there are a few investigations that Hillary Clinton should be thinking about.\n\nUkraine has just opened an investigation into Ukraine\u2019s meddling in our election in 2016. According to reports, the Ukrainians said they did it to help Clinton and Politico has detailed some of the involvement of the Democrats working to help Hillary.\n\nCongress has renewed their request for information from the DOJ that they asked for originally in July 2017 and have demanded to know the status of investigation into the meddling.\n\nThat letter also highlighted news reports that, during the 2016 presidential election, \u201cUkrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump\u201d and did so by \u201cdisseminat[ing] documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggest[ing] they were investigating the matter[.]\u201d[2] Ukrainian officials also reportedly \u201chelped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.\u201d[3] At the center of this plan was Alexandra Chalupa, described by reports as a Ukrainian-American operative \u201cwho was consulting for the Democratic National Committee\u201d and who reportedly met with Ukrainian officials during the presidential election for the express purpose of exposing alleged ties between then-candidate Donald Trump, Paul Manafort, and Russia.[4] Politico also reported on a Financial Times story that quoted a Ukrainian legislator, Serhiy Leschenko, as saying that Trump\u2019s candidacy caused \u201cKiev\u2019s wider political leadership to do something they would never have attempted before: intervene, however indirectly, in a U.S. election.\u201d[5]\n\nThere\u2019s the DOJ itself, which has U.S. Attorney John Durham saying yes, indeed he is looking into Ukraine meddling in the election.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the Russia probe investigation in which Clinton and the DNC paid Fusion GPS through Perkins Coie to get Russian dirt via Christopher Steele.\n\nAfter three years of Democrats saying it\u2019s collusion and a crime to get information from a foreign national, let\u2019s lay it all out there, what was done. Thinking that Hillary is not going to look very good at the end of it.", "description": "Trump, Jr Does a Terrific Dunk on Hillary Clinton, And That May Not Be All She\u2019s Facing", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Susie Moore", "Sister Toldjah", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Sarah Lee", "Alex Parker", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/donald-trump-jr-rally-aoc-sucks-SCREENSHOT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
