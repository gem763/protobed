Formerly the gardener\u2019s residence, Welbeck Cottage has recently opened to guests, offering out-of-hours access to the estate\u2019s 300 acres of woods and parkland. It\u2019s a magical spot, with winding paths that lead through woods and across bridges to cascades and lakes that reflect the gold and red of the leafy landscape. Inside, the renovated cottage is warm and comfortable, with neutral colours, wooden floors and a twin and double bedroom. Beyond the estate, beautiful Ashdown forest is 15 minutes away for more leaf peeping.\n\n\u2022 Sleeps four, from \u00a3357 for three nights, nationaltrust.org.uk/holidays\n\nForest of Dean, Gloucestershire\n\nThe second-largest crown forest in England after the New Forest (and once a royal hunting ground), the Forest of Dean has magical expanses of wild, ancient woodland. The Speech House Hotel is a 17th-century hideaway with 35 bedrooms (some with four-posters) and two restaurants. Forest walking trails start on the doorstep, it\u2019s next to the Cyril Hart Arboretum, and the Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail is close by, with art works hidden among the trees. The local tourist board has devised a Leaf Peeping drive guide, listing the hotspots for autumn foliage, while nature lovers can book wildlife \u201cdetective\u201d Ed Drewitt for private safaris (up to six people, \u00a3100 for two hours or \u00a3200 full day).\n\n\u2022 Doubles from \u00a357 room only, two-night Autumn Leaves Explorer package from \u00a3278 for two for half-board plus packed lunch or cream tea, thespeechhouse.co.uk\n\nThe Lizard, Cornwall\n\nBuilt in 1840, Frenchman\u2019s Creek is a secluded cottage surrounded by dense woods, near the Helford River estuary on the Lizard peninsula. It has been a source of literary inspiration for several former guests, not least Daphne du Maurier, who named one of her novels after the place. Later tenants were Maria Pendragon and Clara Vyvyan: the latter describes the cottage in her book The Helford River. \u201cOften, instead of reading, I would sit gazing out of the window at that wall of trees rising to the sky and feeling the quiet of that place as if it were soft music.\u201d The two-bedroom hideaway can be reached by boat at high tide, or by foot along a path.\n\n\u2022 Sleeps four, from \u00a3439 for three nights, landmarktrust.org.uk\n\nNational Forest, East Midlands\n\nThe 200-square-mile National Forest is the biggest environment-led regeneration project in the country: by this autumn, 9m trees will have been planted in less than 30 years, on land once scarred by mining and industry. The Old Stables B&B (pictured) in the pretty village of Packington, Leicestershire, is a comfortable base that\u2019s ideal for families, as there are two inter-connecting, beamed rooms (one with bunk beds) and a colourful library of books and games. Great walks are guaranteed on the 75-mile National Forest Way, which is divided into 12 sections and runs from the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire to Beacon Hill Country Park in Leicestershire.\n\n\u2022 From \u00a380 for a double or \u00a3100 for a family room sleeping four, sawdays.co.uk\n\nNew Forest, Hampshire\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A pig foraging for acorns in the New Forest Photograph: Joana Kruse/Alamy\n\nThe New Forest is at its most picturesque in autumn, when ancient oak, beech and sweet chestnut trees turn the landscape gold and red, and the annual pannage (when pigs are released to eat acorns) adds to the ambiance. Treetops is a three-bedroom, contemporary cottage in woods on the banks of the Beaulieu River, with a deck for alfresco dining and a woodburner inside. There are plenty of cycling routes and forest walks on the doorstep. Visit during New Forest Food & Drink Fortnight to try local produce, from pannage pork to beer, at various forest destinations.\n\n\u2022 Sleeps five, from \u00a3731 for three nights, newforestliving.co.uk\n\nMid-Wales\n\nSleep in a tent up in the trees at Red Kite Tree Tents, on a private 81-acre woodland estate next to a swift running stream. Featured on George Clark\u2019s Amazing Spaces, the globe-shaped tree tents (the Dragon\u2019s Egg is the higher of the two) sleep two, are well-insulated, with woodburners and comfortable double beds, and are totally secluded and off-grid. Wooden walkways lead to living platforms with outdoor cooking areas and firepits. Spend the days walking through forests and valleys, or mountain biking through unspoiled hills.\n\n\u2022 Sleeps two, three nights in Dragon\u2019s Egg from \u00a3355, holidaycottages.co.uk\n\nSnowdonia\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Gwydyr forest near Betws-y-Coed\n\nThe small upland hamlet of Rhiwddolion can only be reached on foot \u2013 it\u2019s a 10-minute walk up a forest track, passing large flagstones and ancient oaks. There are three remote properties for rent here (the only remnants of a once-thriving community of slate miners): two cottages, Ty Uchaf and Ty Coch, and the former chapel and school room, Ty Capel (pictured). They sit atop a wooded valley above Betws-y-Coed, home of the Snowdonia national park visitor centre. Close by, Fairy Glen gorge will delight children, Swallow Falls are the highest waterfalls in south Wales, and there are several circular rambles on the doorstep, plus plenty of hiking throughout the park.\n\n\u2022 Cottages sleep two, three and four, from \u00a3259 for three nights, landmarktrust.org.uk\n\nNorth Wessex Downs, Hampshire\n\nIn private woodland on the Hampshire-Berkshire border, Hollington Park Glamping has two vintage-style cabins that are ideal for family campers. It\u2019s a small, dog-friendly site that\u2019s also home to a rabbit, several Indian Runner ducks, chickens, two miniature dachshunds and a great dane, who all enjoy a meet and greet with visitors. The heated cabins have kitchenettes and electricity, plus there\u2019s a shared chill-out space, firepits, and separate showers and composting loos.

For walkers, Dartmoor national park is just five minutes on foot and the old tram line goes from nearby Okehampton village through meadows, woods, and by the river up on the moor; for cyclists, there\u2019s the traffic-free Granite Way. Adventure Okehampton is also just a few minutes\u2019 walk away, offering horse riding, gorge walking, caving, kayaking, river rafting and other activities.\n\n\u2022 Sleeps two, from \u00a386 a night, three-night minimum, independentcottages.co.uk\n\nWye Valley, Herefordshire\n\nFor full forest immersion, try Mrs Higgs Lodge, an isolated house with its own private woodlands within a 3,000-acre estate nine miles west of Hereford. Built in 1835, it had been engulfed by the forest (only the chimneys could be spotted, poking through the trees) until its recent restoration. The rustic charm remains: it\u2019s off-grid, with no wifi or phone signal, woodburners keep it cosy, water comes from the original spring well, and bathroom facilities are in a wooden out-house. Soak up the sounds of the forest from the hot tub; look out for deer, owls and badgers; and hike on the extensive network of woodland trails around the estate and into the Wye Valley.\n\n\u2022 Sleeps four in two bedrooms, three-night stays from \u00a3615, qualityunearthed.co.uk\n\nRiver Nene, Cambridgeshire\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The River Nene near Peterborough.

Red kites can be seen soaring around the woods, which are also home to otters, muntjacs, herons, kingfishers, badgers, swans and more. Kenneth Grahame is said to have stayed in the main house and could well have drawn inspiration for The Wind in The Willows from this peaceful corner near the River Nene. Days spent walking on the Elton-Nassington-Fotheringhay loop or at Ferry Meadows can be followed by nights in the colourful open-plan space, with its vintage furniture, packed bookshelves and games by the woodburner.\n\n\u2022 Sleeps four, three-night weekend from \u00a3450, canopyandstars.co.uk\n\nTamar Valley, Cornwall\n\nSteeped in the history of England\u2019s mining industry, Danescombe Mine, near Calstock, was in operation throughout the 19th century, after which it lay abandoned until the 1970s, when it was restored by the Landmark Trust.
