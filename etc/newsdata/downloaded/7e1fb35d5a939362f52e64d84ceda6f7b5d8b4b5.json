And two of the president\u2019s top Republican allies said Monday they too were not told in advance of the raid.\n\nBut Democrats say Trump\u2019s failure to brief them ahead of the operation is part of a pattern evident since he announced he was withdrawing U.S. troops from northern Syria earlier this month.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor almost a month now, we\u2019ve been requesting an all-senators briefing from the administration on its Syria policy,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerSenate Democrats to vote this week to overturn Trump ObamaCare moves Man explains refusing to shake McConnell's hand at Cummings memorial: 'I couldn't do it' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - ISIS leader dead; Congresswoman resigns MORE (D-N.Y.) said Monday. \u201cAnd according to reports, the Trump administration gave Russia and Turkey some kind of advanced notice of the raid of al-Baghdadi but, seemingly by deliberate choice, neglected to notify the leaders of Congress as is custom in this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems clear that the Trump administration is either reluctant or simply unwilling to keep Congress in the loop on its plan to defeat ISIS and protect American interests in the region,\u201d he added. \u201cThe most likely explanation, unfortunately, is that it does not have one.\u201d\n\nTrump announced Sunday that an overnight raid in the northwest Syrian town of Barisha ended after U.S. troops chased al-Baghdadi into a tunnel where he detonated his suicide vest, killing himself and three children.\n\nThe announcement gave Trump a boost as he battles the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry and faces criticism over his decision to withdraw from northern Syria, allowing a Turkish offensive against Kurdish forces to proceed.\n\nBut Democrats, even as they celebrated the death of the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist, quickly criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the raid.\n\nIn his remarks Sunday, Trump confirmed he told the Russians that the U.S. would be in the area ahead of time but said he didn\u2019t tell Moscow the reason. Russia and Syria control the airspace in Idlib province, where the raid took place, and the U.S. and Russia have operated a \u201cdeconfliction\u201d phone line since 2015 to ensure the two superpowers don\u2019t fire on each other in Syria.\n\nTrump also said he didn\u2019t tell all congressional leaders about the raid beforehand because \u201cWashington is a leaking machine.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry Murkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution Pelosi calls for Congress to pass resolution supporting two-state solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict MORE (D-Calif.) quickly slammed Trump for telling \u201cthe Russians but not top congressional leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top congressional leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement Sunday. \u201cOur military and allies deserve strong, smart and strategic leadership from Washington.\u201d\n\nA Pelosi spokesman said Monday that a briefing has been requested, but \u201cit has not been granted yet.\u201d\n\nSchumer similarly requested a briefing after Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cI look forward to receiving a briefing about this raid and the plan to deal with the escaped ISIS prisoners,\u201d he said in a statement.

He confirmed that he hadn\u2019t been notified before the al-Baghdadi raid.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t, but I was in the similar position when President Obama ordered the attack on Osama bin Laden. I was not called in advance then, nor do I expect to be called in advance now,\u201d McConnell told reporters.\n\n\u201cThe administration attempted to let me know. I didn\u2019t connect with them before the president\u2019s press conference, but they attempted to let me know before he went public, so the two situations were handled exactly the same from my point of view,\u201d McConnell added.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyTop Republicans say impeachment resolution is too little too late Shimkus says he's been asked to reconsider retirement Overnight Defense: Latest on al-Baghdadi's death | Trump weighs releasing raid video | Pentagon reveals 2 suspects captured in raid | House to vote on impeachment procedures | Border wall fight stalls defense bill MORE (R-Calif.) also told reporters from NBC and CNN on Monday he was not briefed ahead of the al-Baghdadi raid.

Schiff is leading the House impeachment inquiry into Trump, and the president has repeatedly attacked him in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a leaker like nobody has ever seen before,\u201d Trump said of Schiff, before launching into a rant on Schiff\u2019s handling of the impeachment probe.\n\nOn Monday evening, Trump continued to zero in on Schiff amid the demands for a briefing.\n\n\u201cCan you believe that Shifty Adam Schiff, the biggest leaker in D.C., and a corrupt politician, is upset that we didn\u2019t inform him before we raided and killed the #1 terrorist in the WORLD!?
