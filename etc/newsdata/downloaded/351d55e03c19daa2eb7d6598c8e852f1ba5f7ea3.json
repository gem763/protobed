More\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang is an aspiring politician. But his angle in the 2020 campaign is that he\u2019s an outsider, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who sees the future and shares the general population\u2019s mistrust of professional lawmakers.\n\nHis major promise has been Universal Basic Income, a $1,000 monthly check from the government for Americans to spend as they see fit, and tonight at the third round of Democratic primary debates he said in his opening statement that he\u2019d begin by giving 10 American families that amount for a year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s original. I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg quipped when Yang finished and it was his turn to make his plea.\n\nBut Yang\u2019s offer, while original indeed, was utterly predictable. In fact, I called it yesterday when Yang\u2019s campaign said he\u2019d do something unprecedented at the debate (other guesses from members of the Quartz newsroom included that he\u2019d show up as a hologram, go pants-less to one-up his traditionally tie-less presence, don a hoodie, or crowdsurf as he has done at campaign events).\n\nThe candidate condemns the American focus on \u201cthe almighty dollar,\u201d yet continuously talks about government as a business. Yang talks about Americans being the \u201cowners and shareholders\u201d of democracy. He announced a contest during a presidential debate. A cash giveaway!\n\nIt\u2019s hardly a move likely to bolster confidence in his ability to run a country. Universal Basic Income may be a good idea, however Yang\u2019s call to action tonight rang not like a novel approach to solving income inequality but like a desperate ploy to attract people to his website.\n\nMore disturbingly, it\u2019s also unseemly. Yang is asking American families to tell him what they would do with the money he\u2019d send them in order for his campaign to determine who are the most worthy recipients. But UBI is pretty much the opposite of that. It\u2019s a plan that is meant to defend personal dignity by supplying everyone with enough money to meet their basic needs instead of asking the poor in particular to make a case for saving them financially.\n\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world\u2019s most important and interesting news.\n\nMore stories from Quartz:", "description": "The presidential candidate whose platform features universal basic income wants to hand out checks.
