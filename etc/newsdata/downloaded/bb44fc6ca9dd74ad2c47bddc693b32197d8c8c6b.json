RPT-COLUMN-China steel, iron ore sectors bet on stimulus hopes over economic reality: Russell\n\n(Repeats item with no changes in text.

ECONOMIC REALITIES\n\nThe official acknowledgement that China's economy is facing headwinds is likely to fuel expectations of further stimulus, over and above measures already taken, such as reducing the reserve requirements of banks three times so far this year.\n\nEffectively, what steel and iron ore market participants are betting on is that the expectation of China stimulus spending will outweigh the reality of slowing economic growth.\n\nWhether they are placing the correct bet may be answered soon enough, as the upcoming China National Day holidays in the first week in October may provide a suitable stage for government announcements on new efforts to turbocharge economic growth.\n\nIn the meantime, it appears hope is trumping reality, with iron ore prices and imports looking robust.\n\nSpot 62% iron ore MT-IO-QIN62=ARG , as assessed by commodity price reporting agency Argus, ended at $97.55 a tonne on Monday, just below the prior close of $99.20, which was the highest in five weeks.\n\nThe iron ore price has rallied 19.7% since hitting an eight-month low of $81.50 a tonne on Aug. 29, amid both some optimism that Beijing and Washington will resume trade talks and expectations for increased Chinese stimulus.\n\nIron ore imports are also recovering from mine closures in Brazil in the wake of a fatal tailings dam disaster in January and a tropical cyclone in Australia in late March.\n\nOfficial data showed imports of the steelmaking ingredient at 94.85 million tonnes in August, a 19-month high.\n\nAugust's figure could well be exceeded in September, with Refinitiv vessel-tracking and port data estimating imports may reach more than 100 million tonnes, although this figure is likely to be revised as the end of the month approaches.\n\nNonetheless, the strength in iron ore prices and imports, as well as those for steel are indicative of a sector that expects better times ahead.\n\nPollution cutbacks in steel-producing regions may also act to support steel prices and margins, which have recovered somewhat in recent weeks, leading to a recovery in production in August.\n\nThe pollution control measures may also result in mills shifting to higher-grade iron ore in a bid to maximise the amount of steel produced for each tonne of the raw material.\n\nOverall, for a bullish view of the steel and iron ore sectors to be justified, it will need broad-based stimulus that supports all the major pillars of steel demand: residential building construction, infrastructure projects and manufacturing such as automobiles and white goods.
