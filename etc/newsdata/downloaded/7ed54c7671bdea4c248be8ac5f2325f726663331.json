The raid turned up $30 million worth of counterfeit Legos and police arrested four people, the BBC reported.\n\nMost Lepin sets, including the Star Wars series, are advertised on many websites that claim to sell the products as \"compatible with Lego.\"\n\nAnd now we know why. Police said in a statement that the toys were copied from Lego blueprints and more than 630,000 finished products were seized from the factory, the BBC reported.\n\nA police investigation is still underway. According to the BBC, images posted by Chinese authorities after the raid showed products that looked nearly identical to those produced by the Danish toy giant, Lego.\n\nThe Lepin brand is definitely a cheaper option, often selling for a fraction of the price of Legos.\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, one website that claims to sell Lepin products had its Star Wars Millennium Falcon kit listed for $313.30 whereas an authentic Lego one goes for $799.99.\n\nZhong Shikai, one of the police officers responsible for investigating the case, told the state-run news agency Xinhua that there are big differences in the craftsmanship and quality when comparing the two.\n\nLego China and Asia Pacific's vice president Robin Smith said the products could pose a safety concern for consumers, Xinhua reported.\n\nForeign companies in China have long expressed dissatisfaction about intellectual property enforcement because of the prevalence of counterfeiting. The AFP reports the raid was a move by China to double down on intellectual property infringements, possibly in an attempt to ease trade tensions with Washington.\n\nXinhua reported that the number of intellectual property rights trials in Shanghai hit a record high last year.", "description": "In an apparent move to crack down on intellectual property infringement, Chinese authorities raided a company that was allegedly manufacturing and selling $30 million worth of counterfeit Legos.", "authors": ["Gabriela Saldivia"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/04/27/gettyimages-1037739620_wide-9beecd0d3f37add4e775a1068c1750a21d19bed4.jpg?s=1400"}
