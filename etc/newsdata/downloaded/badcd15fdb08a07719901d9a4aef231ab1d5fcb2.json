Unless your name is Maria Butina, that is \u2013 then your fate is Russia conspiracy theories, media smears and jail.\n\nYour story begins like a movie: A twenty-something from \u201cflyover country,\u201d going to Moscow to advocate for what Americans consider a basic constitutional right, but which has been curtailed for almost a century. Frustrated by the political and social opposition, you move to the US to study \u2013 at American University in Washington, DC, can\u2019t get more American than that! \u2013 and seek out members and officials of the biggest US advocacy group for your cause.\n\nYou post photos of yourself in a cowboy hat at their conventions in the heartland and tell tall tales to your fellow students in an effort to be cool and fit in.\n\nAlso on rt.com WATCH exclusive VIDEO & PHOTOS of Russian gun activist Maria Butina inside Moscow-bound plane\n\nNext thing you know, you\u2019re being arrested as \u201cunregistered foreign agent,\u201d and your American Dream turns into a Deep State nightmare. You are strip-searched and locked away in solitary confinement for weeks and months.\n\nStaring at the wall of your cell between the humiliations and indignities, with only your thoughts for company, you wonder what your \u201ccrime\u201d might be. Then it hits you: your well-publicized arrest happened on the eve of the presidential summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, which the entire US media establishment and the Democratic Party denounced as \u201ctreason\u201d in advance. Two days earlier, special counsel Robert Mueller had charged 12 \u201cRussian intelligence officers,\u201d and now you are all tangled up in that conspiracy.\n\nYour name is Maria Butina.\n\nAlso on rt.com Gun activist Maria Butina leaves prison in Tallahassee, Fl and heads to Russia\n\nJust days after your arrest, Assistant US Attorney Erik M. Kenerson tells reporters your text messages show you offering \u201csex in exchange for a position within a special interest organization.\u201d\n\nNo one questions him. \u2018Red Sparrow\u2019 had recently opened in theaters, further feeding fantasies about Russian spies manufactured by the CIA and Hollywood. So your life becomes tawdry, Cold War spy erotica. None of it is true, but you can\u2019t defend yourself, and your lawyer has been gagged by a federal judge.\n\n\u201cSex and schmoozing are common Russian spy tactics. Publicity makes Maria Butina different,\u201d reads a headline in USA Today. Time Magazine says you \u201clived a double life by using sex and a love of guns to infiltrate American political organizations...in order to advance Moscow\u2019s agenda.\u201d When your lawyer protests, asking what kind of spy posts photos of activism on social media, USA Today sees that as \u201cevidence the Russians have grown bolder in their spy efforts.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Butina prosecutors wrote their own James Bond novel with sex allegations \u2013 and the media loved it\n\nIt takes the prosecutors almost two months to sort-of apologize and say they \u201cmisunderstood\u201d your texts. The media bury this retraction, if they report it at all.\n\nConsular officials coming to check in on you are appalled at the \u201cborderline torture\u201dconditions of your detention: strip-searches, sleep deprivation, denial of healthcare and hygiene products (you know what that means). Aha! Cry the media, this is proof positive that you are an Agent of Putin Himself \u2013 even though consular visits are an elementary right under international law. It doesn\u2019t matter. The Narrative must be preserved.\n\nMost people in federal custody break. It\u2019s only a matter of time. They plead guilty to a lesser charge just to have some hope of ever getting out. So you bend the knee, pleading guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent \u2013 and get sentenced to 18 months.\n\nAlso on rt.com US court sentences Russian gun activist Maria Butina to 18 months in jail\n\n\u201cI came to the US with hope,\u201d you say. Now that hope has turned to ashes, because your name is Maria Butina, you\u2019re Russian, and Russiagate must be fed.\n\nPutin himself describes the verdict as \u201ca travesty of justice,\u201d saying that the US is trying to save face by jailing you because there is no crime they can convict you of. Of course, the media take this as further proof of your guilt.\n\nEven then, you don\u2019t break. Months go by, and your sentence is over. Right on cue, CNN describes you as \u201cthe first Russian citizen convicted of crimes relating to the 2016 US election.\u201d Politico says you \u201cadmitted to being a secret agent of the Kremlin\u201d who \u201cinfiltrated\u201d the NRA. Just more lies on a growing mountain of smears.\n\nYou are bundled out of prison and turned over to immigration agents, to be deported. There are no immigrant rights activists, no ACLU, no NGOs protesting this. Of course not. Your name is Maria Butina, you\u2019re a Russian, and the narrative must be fed.\n\nShe didn't \"infiltrate\" the NRA, she didn't trade sex for political access, and her \"crimes\" had nothing to do with \"election interference.\" Her life was ruined based on prosecutors' disgusting smear campaign -- eagerly abetted by the media -- and it's a total disgrace \u2014 Michael Tracey (@mtracey) October 25, 2019\n\nA handful of honest journalists will point out the entire smear campaign was a \u201ctotal disgrace\u201d and \u201cone of the most egregious political persecutions in recent history,\u201d even calling it\u201cone of Russiagate's most shameful episodes.\u201d\n\nA congresswoman from Kentucky sympathizes, says you were \u201cjailed to satiate the rampant Russophobia in the US these days.\u201d\n\nShe served a ridiculously long sentence essentially for not filing the right paperwork. But now she is free. Sadly, she was jailed to satiate the rampant Russophobia in the US these days. We are better than this.https://t.co/ZNkKfD9wnP \u2014 Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) October 25, 2019\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s left of our great republic here should be ashamed of the way this justice was miscarried,\u201d Daniel McAdams of the Ron Paul Institute tells RT.\n\nIt\u2019s cold comfort to you now. You board that plane knowing that your parents will be waiting on the other side, and it\u2019s been so long. Far too long. You just want to go home. Barmaul, near the border with Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia, may even be far enough from the US to leave the haters behind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving America, and then it will all be over,\u201d you say.\n\nMaybe, as some well-intentioned people have suggested, you can write a book. \u201cRussiagate\u2019s first victim\u201d sounds good as a headline. You come to America to get an education, and get far more than you bargained for \u2013 but as you said yourself, \u201cRussians don\u2019t surrender.\u201d\n\nYour name is Maria Butina, and you survived Russiagate. Welcome home.\n\nNebojsa Malic, senior writer at RT\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
