The first iteration of the update was made available to Macs running Catalina on October 15.\n\nLike last week's update, of which this is apparently a new version, this Supplemental Update promises to fix problems some users encountered when there was limited disk space available. It also fixes issues with saving Game Center data that users faced when playing Apple Arcade games offline, a Setup Assistant bug, and a problem that prevented users from being able to accept iCloud terms when logged into multiple iCloud accounts on the same machine.\n\nIf you prefer to hear things in Apple's own words, here are the release notes provided by the company to accompany the update:\n\nThe macOS Catalina Supplemental Update includes installation and reliability improvements, and is recommended for all users. This update: Improves installation reliability of macOS Catalina on Macs with low disk space\n\nFixes an issue that prevented Setup Assistant from completing during some installations\n\nResolves an issue that prevents accepting iCloud Terms and Conditions when multiple iCloud accounts are logged in\n\nImproves the reliability of saving Game Center data when playing Apple Arcade games offline\n\nThese bullet points match last week's update, and AppleInsider quotes \"sources inside Apple\" who say that users who already downloaded the previous update don't have to download this one. It is not immediately clear to users, then, exactly what is different in this new version. Apple does not usually release a new version of an existing update without explanation or update notes that list any differences.\n\nApple's update cadence after this year's annual software updates for its various platforms have been more aggressive than usual, with the company seeking to address bugs quickly.\n\nmacOS Catalina was released on October 7, 2019. It splits iTunes into three new applications following the iOS model (TV, Music, and Podcasts), brings official support for a new method of porting iPad apps to Macs, brings new features to apps like Reminders and Safari, adds the Apple Arcade game subscription service in the Mac App Store, introduces the Find My and Screen Time apps previously seen in one form or another on iOS, and ends support for 32-bit applications, among other things.", "description": "What Apple has changed is unclear, but it's available if you didn't grab the first.", "authors": ["Samuel Axon"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/macOS-Catalina-Light-mode-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
