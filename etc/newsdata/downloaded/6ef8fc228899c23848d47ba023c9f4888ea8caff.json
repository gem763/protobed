Toronto, who defeated Seattle in the 2017 final, face Atlanta in Georgia on Wednesday.\n\nTuesday\u2019s match had got off to a cagey start, with Los Angeles quickly settling into their slick passing game but unable to create much in the way of goal-scoring opportunities against a well-organised Seattle.\n\nThe breakthrough came after 17 minutes, when Los Angeles talisman Carlos Vela surged forward to win a free-kick 25 yards from goal.\n\nThe Mexico international stood over the dead ball as if to shoot but instead left the strike to Colombian midfielder Atuesta who duly curled in a sublime strike to beat Stefan Frei.\n\nThe Banc of California Stadium erupted and Los Angeles looked to be on a roll. Three minutes later Uruguayan international Brian Rodriguez tested Frei with an angled shot from the left which the Seattle goalkeeper could only parry away.
