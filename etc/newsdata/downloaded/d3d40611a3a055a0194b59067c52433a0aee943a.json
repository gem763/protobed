(AP) - A Rhode Island judge has dismissed a lawsuit about the state legalizing and launching sports betting.\n\nThe Providence Journal reports a Superior Court judge sided with the state in ruling Monday that Republican activist Daniel Harrop lacked standing to sue because he wasn\u2019t personally harmed by the state legalizing sports betting without voter approval any more than any other resident.\n\nHarrop argued the state should have sought voter approval before legalizing and launching sports betting in November.\n\nLawyers for the state lottery and Twin River Casino had said Harrop isn\u2019t hurt by sports betting and lacked standing.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling didn\u2019t address the underlying constitutional question.\n\nHarrop\u2019s attorney, Joseph Larisa, says he\u2019ll look for another plaintiff who could have standing, such as a gambler who lost money on sports betting.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Rhode Island judge has dismissed a lawsuit about the state legalizing and launching sports betting.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
