Policy positions often are just a way of signaling where a candidate stands on the political spectrum. But 2020 is shaping up to be different, the most ideas-driven election in recent American history. On the Democratic side, a robust debate about inequality has given rise to ambitious proposals to redress the imbalance in Americans\u2019 economic situations. Candidates are churning out positions on banking regulation, antitrust law and the future effects of artificial intelligence. The Green New Deal is spurring debate on the crucial issue of climate change, which could also play a role in a possible Republican challenge to Donald Trump.\n\nYahoo News will be examining these and other policy questions in \u201cThe Ideas Election\u201d \u2014 a series of articles on how candidates are defining and addressing the most important issues facing the United States as it prepares to enter a new decade.\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine has, as one consequence, called attention to the conflict between career foreign service professionals and Trump\u2019s political appointees to ambassadorships and other key positions.\n\nGordon Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, made headlines Tuesday for his last-minute refusal, on orders from the State Department, to testify about his role in Trump\u2019s efforts to coerce Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nA GOP donor and hotel magnate with no prior diplomatic experience, Sondland was appointed to his current post by Trump in 2017. How he became embroiled in the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withhold U.S. military aid from Ukraine as well as the president\u2019s attempts to convince Ukraine\u2019s president investigate former Vice President Joe Biden remains unclear. While a priority trading partner with the EU, Ukraine itself is not a member state.\n\nPresident Trump with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, second from right.

Text messages made public last week illuminated his role in pressuring Ukraine\u2019s government to launch an investigation into Biden and to promote Trump talking points that the president had sought a quid pro quo linking the release of military aid for dirt on one of Trump\u2019s leading political rivals.\n\nApart from Sondland\u2019s personal qualifications and his alleged willingness to put loyalty to Trump ahead of U.S. policy interests, the imbroglio illustrates what critics say is a worrisome decline in the morale of American foreign service professionals, and a waning of American \u201csoft power\u201d around the world. As Trump\u2019s first secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, famously put it, \u201cIf you don\u2019t fully fund the State Department, then I need to buy more ammunition.\u201d\n\nAwarding political patronage with a plum diplomatic post is a time-honored tradition in American politics.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s picks for ambassadorships, however, have drawn scrutiny, with critics alleging they were picked simply because they donated large sums of money. In fact, roughly half of those Trump has nominated to serve as ambassadors have been political appointees, NBC News reported. Doug Manchester, for instance, is a billionaire real estate developer who became ambassador to the Bahamas after donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee. Trump\u2019s pick to be the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., succeeding Nikki Haley, is longtime GOP donor Kelly Craft, who donated over $260,000 to Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, while her husband kicked in roughly $1 million to the president\u2019s inaugural committee. John Rakolta Jr., the U.S. ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, is another Republican megadonor \u2014 giving $250,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee \u2014 and was approved for his post despite holding no prior diplomatic experience.", "description": "The House impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine has, as one consequence, called attention to the conflict between career foreign service professionals and Trump\u2019s political appointees to ambassadorships and other key positions.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nZwJaCXTUfwwVJGFXFLsNA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/8fc3b1d0-e9ff-11e9-8fcf-d66857bd6d8d", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
