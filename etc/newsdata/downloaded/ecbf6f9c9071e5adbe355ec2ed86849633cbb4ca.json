James Milner opened the scoring for the visitors before helping to double Liverpool\u2019s lead by creating a goal for a player nearly half his age, 17-year-old Ki-Jana Hoever.\n\nThe visit of the Premier League leaders attracted a record home crowd for a MK Dons match, an attendance of nearly 29,000 representing an increase of more than 300% on the turn-out for their last match here, the 1-0 defeat against Southend on Saturday. So chants of \u201cYou\u2019re only here to see the European champions\u201d would hardly have been misplaced, except that none of the players who started last season\u2019s Champions League final made the trip to Buckinghamshire. Instead, and notwithstanding the presence of six distinguished senior players, this was more like a preview of Liverpool\u2019s future, with five of the club\u2019s most exciting youngsters given their first starts.\n\nOxford United humiliate West Ham in shock Carabao Cup thrashing Read more\n\nNever had a player as young as Harvey Elliott \u2013 age 16 years and 174 days \u2013 begun a competitive match for Liverpool\u2019s senior team. Here the prodigy made his first appearance since joining in the summer from Fulham, with whom he made history last season by becoming the youngest player to feature for anyone in this competition. He shone here and could have scored but twice struck shots against the crossbar.\n\nElliot was the most eye-catching of the teenagers in Liverpool\u2019s front three, but 18-year-old Curtis Jones also impressed, while 19-year-old Rhian Brewster made less of an impact even if his movement hinted at the potential that he is known to have. J\u00fcrgen Klopp was eager to praise another of the debutants, 20-year-old Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher, who made an excellent late save to deny Jordan Bowery.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Liverpool\u2019s Harvey Elliott controls the ball in the Carabao Cup clash at MK Dons.

They nearly stole the limelight with a nice attack in the 11th minute, which ended with Conor McGrandles whacking a shot just over the bar from 12 yards. Then Liverpool took centre stage. Milner danced forward from left-back to smash a low pass across the face of goal. This looked like being Elliott\u2019s moment to announce himself but he slammed his shot against the bar from six yards.\n\nUndeterred, Elliott continued to down the right with skill, enterprise and an artful left foot. With one marvellous piece of play in the 26th minute he invited Milner to score but the veteran sent a plunging header inches wide.\n\nEventually Milner made the breakthrough thanks to a large helping of luck. When a poor clearance fell to him just at the edge of the area, his shot seemed little more than a token gesture until Stuart Moore fumbled it over the line.\n\nDaniel James gives nervy Manchester United shootout win against Rochdale Read more\n\nThe hosts tried to fight back but landed no blows, Bowery going closest with a shot off the outside of the post. Hoever soon tidied up matters for Liverpool with a wonderful goal. Milner created it by hanging up a cross to the back post, where the 17-year-old leapt between George Williams and Joe Walsh to head superbly into the net.\n\nKelleher still had to make a fine save foil Bowery after that. Klopp attributed Liverpool\u2019s raggedness towards the end to inexperience. \u201cThe team had a lack of rhythm and experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThe player with the most experience and rhythm was the best on the pitch [Milner]. But it\u2019s so important we have these games and are brave enough to use the young boys. They have to feel these situations.\u201d\n\nDespite a bit of late panic, Liverpool went close to making it 3-0, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hitting the post from long-range before Elliot curled another effort against the bar. So the 16-year-old did not get on the scoresheet but sure made an impression on his boss. \u201cHe will always be a special player for moments but his overall performance, including defence, was very good,\u201d said Klopp.", "description": "James Milner scored one and set up another for Ki-Jana Hoever as Liverpool won 2-0 at MK Dons in the Carabao Cup third round", "authors": ["Paul Doyle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d26164f7063b743a1c0fcc09bd15e2adbcdb3cf2/0_161_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb6884e9e476da7ae874389cf10f9330", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
