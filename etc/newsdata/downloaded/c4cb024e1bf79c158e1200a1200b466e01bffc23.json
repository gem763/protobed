It also positions us solidly as one of the top three fundraisers in this race,\u201d said Mike Schmuhl, the Buttigieg campaign manager, in a memo released Tuesday morning. \u201cWe will have the resources to go the full distance, and to win, the 2020 nominating contests.\u201d\n\nButtigieg\u2019s announcement will kick off a series of fundraising declarations from rivals as the Democratic field counts their money after the third quarter, which ended Monday night. And while the summer fundraising period is often slower than others, as donors take vacations and check out from politics, the rising importance of digital fundraising could give some candidates an opportunity to build on big second-quarter totals.\n\nVice President Joe Biden was the only other candidate besides Buttigieg to crack $20 million in the second quarter, bringing in $21.5 million following his entry into the race. Sens. Elizabeth Warren ($19.1 million) and Bernie Sanders ($18 million) were close behind, followed by Kamala Harris ($12 million) \u2014 the only other candidate to break eight figures in the spring.\n\nCandidates must file FEC disclosures detailing their third-quarter fundraising and spending by October 15.\n\nButtigieg's fundraising announcement comes amid an all-out push by the mayor's campaign to invest more heavily in early-state infrastructure. Buttigieg spent more than 20 percent of the quarter on the ground in Iowa, and his campaign opened 42 field offices across the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The campaign also expanded its staffing footprint in the early states over the summer.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/28/c2/b832c430408f8aa8a74b94e13076/191001-buttigieg-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
