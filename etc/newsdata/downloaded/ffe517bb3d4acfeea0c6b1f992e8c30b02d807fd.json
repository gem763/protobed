In 2017, the Public Trust Steering Committee (PTSC) was formed to serve a similar mandate.\n\nIn late 2018, Agriculture and Agri-food Canada gave more than $400,000 to be shared between the Canadian Centre for Food Integrity and the Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA), a group that administered its share of the money through the PTSC. The stimulus was for the building of consumer confidence in Canada\u2019s food systems.\n\nThis year, the Public Trust Steering Committee empowered CCFI to lead the charge in tackling this growing problem.\n\n\u201cThis welcomed announcement provides an opportunity to have one, united voice with a national focus to coordinate efforts to build public trust in Canada\u2019s food system,\u201d said CCFI CEO John Jamieson in a September news release. \u201cWe appreciate the work the PTSC did and look forward to executing on our newly defined mandate to work collaboratively to coordinate trust activities, provide credible resources and to up the ante on proactive communications.\u201d\n\nThe work these groups and others like them are doing is research-driven, comprehensive and important. Their findings are public.\n\nThe hope is that an increased understanding of and confidence in agriculture will help the industry thrive and allay skepticism over current food production practices.\n\nBut in the sector\u2019s efforts to push for a pro-ag, pro-transparency environment the agriculture industry has laid the groundwork for something it never intended.\n\nIn some cases, the impulse of industry and its influencers to tackle this issue has become so strong they have become blind to their blunder of treating trust as a marketing campaign, the contents of which often contain clever, empty one-liners about the great things ag is doing and just how sustainable and environmentally conscious farmers are.\n\nHaving the trust of the public would be a market and policy booster for farmers. Cities have the voting power, the clout, and farmers are vulnerable to their attitudes. It\u2019s a systemic weakness the industry has tackled through a narrative that prods at something deep, like the word trust.\n\nTrust is not won; it\u2019s earned. Slogans won\u2019t get us there.\n\nIf farmers want to shed the stereotypes foisted on them and talk openly to consumers about the realities of agriculture \u2014 and they should want this \u2014 then they need to do more than commission the help of marketing agencies.\n\nThe agricultural community has urged the public to be critical of misleading food labels, such as \u201cdoes not contain GMOs,\u201d \u201corganic,\u201d and \u201call-natural,\u201d arguing that consumers shouldn\u2019t be convinced by coy marketing. There\u2019s more to the story. Organic doesn\u2019t mean pesticide-free. GMOs are not unhealthy. And all-natural is an unregulated designation that allows the consumer to believe what he or she wants to believe about the quality of that product.\n\nIf the ag sector\u2019s desire to build trust is genuine, then it needs to demonstrate a genuine interest in its potential friends through, among other things, attributing more depth to them and not assuming they don\u2019t know anything about what we\u2019re doing on our farms. All this, while finding appropriate venues in which to acknowledge that farmers are not doing everything right.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough message for a group of which I am a member, but I am being critical in a public forum on purpose: Real trust requires both sides to acknowledge their flaws.\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "Toban Dyck: Farmers need to do more than commission the help of marketing agencies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gmo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
