Before last night I would have told you that that was an uncharitable read of his point. \u201cHe\u2019s not saying Morey should be punished,\u201d I would have told you, \u201che\u2019s saying that the league has a double standard for executives versus players. Execs get more freedom to gamble with the NBA\u2019s bottom line than players do, which is unfair. Just apply the same standard the next time a player says something that might cost the league a buck.\u201d\n\nBut after watching James go face-first into the tank for China in the name of the almighty dollar, I no longer think that read is unfair. He probably was nudging Silver to sanction Morey. We can\u2019t have a double standard for executives and players, says LeBron; both should be censored equally in the name of pleasing the NBA\u2019s Chinese masters.\n\nJames argued that if something a NBA player had tweeted had cost the league money they would have been punished, and questioned why the same wasn\u2019t happening to Morey, according to Dave McMenamin on ESPN. \u201cNearly a week ago today, in a Shanghai hotel room, or Shanghai hotel ballroom, Adam Silver got up and addressed the players, and LeBron James is one of the players who got up and spoke and said, \u2018Hey, what are we doing here? Daryl Morey made these statements,\u2019\u201d McMenamin recalled on air Tuesday. \u201cYou know damn well if a player made the same statements and caused such poor ramifications for the league, there would be some sort of league recourse.\u201d \u201cThere would be repercussions the player has to pay. You know, potentially this tweet could cost the NBA hundreds of millions of dollars. That could come out of the players\u2019 pockets, and so that\u2019s the double standard that was being addressed in that meeting,\u201d he continued.\n\nThere are reports on the wires this afternoon of protesters in Hong Kong destroying James-branded merchandise in disgust at his comment. Says a Twitter pal, remembering the fiasco after James ditched Cleveland for Miami, \u201cHas anyone had their jerseys burned en masse by the residents of more cities than LeBron?\u201d\n\nLakers superstar LeBron James took a hit in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, where basketball fans trampled on jerseys bearing his name after the four-time MVP waded into the NBA controversy involving the country\u2026 \u201cPlease remember, all NBA players, what you said before: \u2018Black lives matter.\u2019 Hong Kong lives also matter!\u201d one of the protesters, William Mok, 36, told a crowd of hundreds\u2026 \u201cJames was trying, you know, to take a side, on the China side, which is like ridiculous,\u201d said Aaron Lee, 36, a marketing director. \u201cHe was being honest, financially. Financial is money. Simple as that. LeBron James stands for money. Period.\u201d\n\nLeBron James stands for money. Period. If you want to make him rethink his fascist apologetics, you need to hit him in the wallet. The only solution is a boycott of the NBA.\n\nMeanwhile on ESPN, here\u2019s Stephen A. Smith mustering some righteous indignation \u2026 at Daryl Morey, for supposedly thinking only of himself when he tweeted. How the hell did we arrive at a point in this fiasco where the overt moneygrubbers like LeBron are supposedly being thoughtful while the one guy in the league willing to make a tiny gesture of support for demonstrators opposing a totalitarian state is mindlessly selfish? And what about the question raised in the tweet \u2014 until when, exactly, does Smith think Morey should have waited to send his pro-HK tweet? He can\u2019t possibly believe that China would be okay with NBA personnel supporting the protests just as long as they waited until they\u2019re back on U.S. soil to do so. If that\u2019s the case, then what\u2019s LeBron\u2019s excuse for not speaking up in favor of Hong Kong now?", "description": "Bottom line.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
