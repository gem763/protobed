But depending on the report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz, Comey may not be traveling anywhere at all. The Department of Justice announced last week that it was opening a criminal investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nAt Politicon 2019 in Nashville on Saturday, during a \"conversation\" with Never Trumper MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, Comey said, \"Our leaders must reflect the glue that holds us together. They can\u2019t be people who lie all the time. They just can\u2019t. And I hope people see that\u2019s true whether they are Republicans or Democrats. Wallace then asked, \"What if he wins again? Will you still believe that?\" Comey said, \"I will be, from my new home in New Zeland, I will still believe in America.\"\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey says he's moving to New Zealand if President Donald Trump wins re-election pic.twitter.com/fBMPaJHEPI \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 26, 2019\n\nIn an 83-page report, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that Comey improperly released FBI information in order to help launch the Mueller investigation of the 2016 presidential election. That report is different than the soon-to-be-released IG report on the origins of the Russia investigation and the possible abuse of FISA warrants.\n\nHe\u2019s moving to Rykers Island before the election \u2014 Nicksterot65 (@Nicksterot65) October 26, 2019\n\nTons of celebrities also pledged to leave the country if Trump won back in 2016, and they are all still here. I'm looking at you Barbra Streisand. They stayed in America and cashed in on the strong economy.\n\nCan we get this in writing? https://t.co/AHpxekyg7m \u2014 Dan Bongino (@dbongino) October 27, 2019", "description": "Former FBI Director James Comey says he will move to New Zeland if President Trump wins reelection..10/26/2019 23:59:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/38/1bd5156a-4071-40d0-a1d2-b5c38fff6b24.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
