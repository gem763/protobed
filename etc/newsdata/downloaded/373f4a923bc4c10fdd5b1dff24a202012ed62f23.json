Whether the EU decides now to open accession talks ... is a test of the Union's ability to deliver on its promises and look to the future.\"\n\n\"North Macedonia and Albania did what we asked them to do. Achieving that required a significant effort from their citizens, for whom the European perspective has been a great source of motivation and determination.\"\n\nThey ended the letter by saying: \"We believe that now is the time to open accession talks with both countries.\"\n\nThe question of whether to open talks with North Macedonia and Albania is expected to be on the agenda on the EU's General Affairs Council on October 15. Both last year and in June this year, the Council delayed a decision. France and the Netherlands have been the most outspoken opponents of a start to talks for the two countries.\n\nThe issue could end up with EU leaders at the European Council on October 17-18. However, enlargement is not mentioned on the official agenda, save for the line \"depending on events, EU leaders might also discuss foreign policy issues.\"\n\nSome countries are willing to see a debate on enlargement at the summit, according to two diplomats. At a meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday, positions were unchanged, with the majority of member states in favor of opening negotiations while some, led by France, are still not convinced, said one of the diplomats. Some diplomats expect North Macedonia alone to get the green light in the end.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, the EU held out the prospect of the two countries being invited to start membership talks in June this year and the European Commission declared in May that both had made the necessary progress on democratic standards and the rule of law.\n\nFailure to reach agreement on inviting the two countries to begin talks has infuriated some EU members and European Commission officials. They argue that delaying a decision undermines the bloc's credibility, puts the pro-EU governments of both countries in peril and risks boosting strategic rivals in the western Balkans such as Russia, China and Turkey.\n\nOpponents of starting talks cite the western Balkans' deep-seated problems with corruption, organized crime and poverty and its recent history of conflict. France has emerged as a leading enlargement skeptic, arguing that the EU must deepen integration among existing members and reform unwieldy decision-making processes before it contemplates adding new countries.\n\nTusk has long been a supporter of EU enlargement and publicly backed North Macedonia joining the EU during a visit to Skopje last month, following a meeting with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.", "description": "Ursula von der Leyen signs up to appeal for accession negotiations to get under way.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison", "David M.
