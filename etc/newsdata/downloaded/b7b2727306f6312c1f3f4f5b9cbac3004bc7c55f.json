I replied and told him I had a debit card.\"\n\nThe fraudster told Sam that he knew how to \"hack the online banking app\" - he said he \"could get me lots of money\".\n\nHe even managed to address - and calm - Sam's doubts, explaining he had a plan in place for Sam if he ever got caught.\n\n\"The man said it was easy and even if I got caught, I could just say that my card got stolen, so there was no chance of me getting in any trouble,\" Sam said.\n\n\"He checked that my debit card showed my sort code and account number, and he then just asked that I give him the card and a few more personal details. In exchange for that he promised me \u00a31,000. It was as easy as that.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nSam handed over his card - and over the course of a month, money was deposited into his account twice - amounting to \u00a34,000 altogether.\n\n\"I went into my local branch twice to withdraw the money that had been transferred,\" he said.\n\n\"I went alone both times. The \"messenger\" was not with me nor was the person who took my card. They both left me to do the withdrawals on my own.\"\n\nSam explained that he had little communication after that - bar the odd update from a \"messenger\" who'd then disappear off the radar.\n\n\"To me it felt like just an easy way to get hold of \u00a31,000 \u2013 I was just sharing my account details and a bit of information, that was all,\" Sam explained.\n\n\"I was 15 at the time and it was a lot of money.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I knew it wasn't legitimate, but I also remember thinking that if the bank contacted me about it, I could just say I\u2019d just lost my card and I didn't know how the money got there, someone must have put it in the account when it was stolen.\"\n\nBut the entire plan folded when Sam's account was later frozen - a battle he's still fighting.\n\n\"After I tried to withdraw the rest of the money, my account was frozen and I was told to call the bank and tell them that I had tried to move the money to a relative.\n\n\"After I told the fraudster what had happened, he seemed angry and accused me of lying to him.\n\n\"He threatened me by telling me he knew my mum\u2019s maiden name and my address and told me he would come to my house if I didn't give him the money.\n\n\"I was really scared and worried, so I told my parents. He then threatened my parents directly and it was only when my dad mentioned it to someone else that we got everything under control.\"\n\nSam knew it wasn't right from the very beginning, but it wasn't until later that he realised exactly what he'd implicated himself in.\n\n\"I thought it was just a quick way to get a little bit of money and no-one was going to get hurt. I thought I could claim ignorance and it would be fine.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nTo date, Sam's account remains frozen and he's not been able to open another account or take out a new mobile phone contract due to the criminal nature of his actions.\n\nAnd he's not alone.\n\nBanks are closing tens of thousands of accounts a year in the UK due to \u201cmoney muling\u201d, MPs warned earlier this year.\n\nThis is the act of holding - and transferring - dirty money in exchange for a reward, often cash.\n\nAccording to fraud prevention services, more people than ever are being recruited into it at school gates, universities and at targeted events.\n\nOften, the person won't understand the potential consequences of their actions - or that they're being used as a money mule.\n\nBut the reality is that implicating yourself in it could lead to difficulty in opening bank accounts, obtaining mortgages, other loans and credit cards, as well as a 14-year prison sentence once caught.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s some sort of mark against my name, which makes normal life, like topping up a travel card, really tough,\" Sam explained.\n\n\"I\u2019d tell anyone who was approached by someone promising you money for what seems like nothing that it\u2019s a scam.\n\n\"It may sound harmless, and they might try and convince you that you can get away with it, but it\u2019s not ok.\n\n\"When the bank told me I\u2019d been involved in ultimately money laundering and fraud, it felt like everything changed. It wasn't a simple way to make a quick buck, it was a massive error of judgement.\n\n\"I didn't end up making any money from it as the bank suspended my account for fraudulent activity - now, I'm completely trapped.\"\n\n\"Acting as a money mule is both illegal and highly dangerous - and engaging in it could ruin your future, one fraud expert at Santander told Mirror Money.\n\n\"Allowing someone who you don\u2019t know \u2013 whatever their excuse \u2013 to use your account to transfer money is playing with fire and supports the criminal gangs behind everything from prostitution to terrorism,\" Chris Ainsley, head of fraud strategy explained.\n\n\"Steer clear of anything that offers too much for too little, it\u2018s likely to be a con.\"\n\nProtect yourself\n\n(Image: Getty Images)", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Have you ever held \u00a31,000 at once in your hand?
