However, ultimately, it will be defined as a criminal incident.\u201d\n\nThe propaganda organs include official and unofficial news outlets such as the party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily newspaper and all offshoots and the multiple state-run television channels of China Central Television. The propaganda order calls for minimizing the total number of protesters who turn out and downplaying the wide popular support in Hong Kong for the protests.\n\nA recent protest was estimated by non-Chinese media to include around 1.7 million people, showing that weeks of protests against Chinese rule show no signs of abating.\n\nAnother propaganda theme has been to overemphasize support for the Hong Kong government and its police forces, which have been turned out in large numbers to suppress the protests.\n\nChina also wants to classify various social groups in distinct categories: those not protesting as a \u201csilent majority\u201d and the protesters as \u201cyoung, ignorant and manipulated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are tools used by enemy Western forces,\u201d the guidelines say.\n\nThe propaganda directive also calls for labeling the protesters as terrorists \u2014 a theme already widely reported in recent weeks by official Chinese media.\n\nMedia are directed to highlight Western flags used in protests in print, photographic and televised reports to promote the propaganda that the Hong Kong activists are backed by the CIA.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, as much as possible try not to leak any slogans on democracy and freedom in the footage and photos used in our reports,\u201d the guidelines say.\n\nNoting growing support for the democracy protesters among foreign politicians, the directive states, \u201cThis is exactly what we want, and we should emphasize these reports, which fully illustrate how the hostile forces from the West are trying to disrupt the situation and create chaos.\u201d\n\nChinese media also are blocking all reports that would show \u201cpeople voicing their support of the protesters or saying they understand the protesters.\u201d\n\nAnd excessive force used against the protesters by police \u201cmust be blocked and deleted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely forbidden to circulate such within WeChat, Weibo, or any type of social media,\u201d the directive says.\n\nThe propaganda organs also are called on to use foreign supporters and fellow travelers.\n\n\u201cFully utilize the economic attractions of the mainland market to persuade the patriotic businessmen in the mainland and the patriotic entertainment celebrities to stand up and speak out their support for the government and police,\u201d the notice says. \u201cFirmly control the supervision on traditional media and banning on social media, in order to strongly direct public opinion.\u201d\n\nThe directive was first reported by Guo Media, the online U.S. outlet led by dissident Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui.\n\nTwitter this week announced it had uncovered 936 Chinese accounts that were part of \u201ca significant state-backed information operation focused on the situation in Hong Kong\u201d aimed at undermining the protests. The accounts were suspended.\n\nDIA ON CHINESE DATA DOMINANCE\n\nArmy Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, this week warned that China\u2019s military is seeking to use data and information in future warfare.\n\nGen. Ashely, speaking at a DIA conference in Tampa, Florida, said the outlines of China\u2019s information warfare are contained in a recent defense white paper published by the Chinese government.\n\nThe Chinese \u201cunderstand that the ability to leverage data is part of what it means to be a great power,\u201d the three-star general said.\n\n\u201cAnd information is how China plans to dominate in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is their strategy to get behind decision advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cDecision advantage\u201d is the intelligence buzz phrase for providing the best intelligence at the fastest speed to assist war fighters and other leaders.\n\nThe July white paper, \u201cChina\u2019s National Defense in the New Era,\u201d emphasizes the building of a high-tech military through \u201cinformationization\u201d \u2014 China\u2019s word for advanced war fighting techniques.\n\n\u201cWar is evolving in form towards informationized warfare, and intelligent warfare is on the horizon,\u201d the paper said.\n\nChina is seeking to implement a new round of technological and industrial revolution for its military that includes the application of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum information, big data, cloud computing and the \u201cinternet of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a prevailing trend to develop long-range precision, intelligent, stealthy or unmanned weaponry and equipment,\u201d the paper says, adding that the Chinese military needs to rapidly advance in the area of high-technology and information-based warfare.\n\nThe goal is to create an \u201cintelligent military.\u201d\n\nRetired Army Gen. Raymond A. Thomas, former commander of the Special Operations Command, said the U.S. military is working to address China\u2019s asymmetric military strategy. Gen. Thomas said during a security conference in Colorado last month that as recently as three years ago U.S. national policy \u201cspecifically declared [China] not an adversary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn relatively short time, we\u2019ve flipped this to [China] seems pretty adversarial. It\u2019s been baked into our national security strategy now, our national defense strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe United States, he added, is aggressively competing with China economically and the military is keeping a close watch on China\u2019s buildup as well.\n\nChina\u2019s strategic initiatives are more coherent than those of the United States. \u201cThey have a very coherent approach to campaign design, a futuristic goal, and that\u2019s probably the cause of most of the anxiety,\u201d Gen. Thomas said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re moving out very coherently and with two huge advantages: resourcing \u2014 gads of money \u2014 and a data advantage right now that we can\u2019t even imagine. They are hoarding data and getting reps on data to a level that is unimaginable even to some of our major companies.\u201d\n\nCHINESE NUCLEAR FIRMS SANCTIONED\n\nThe Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security has imposed sanctions on four Chinese nuclear companies for diverting American technology to Beijing\u2019s nuclear buildup.\n\nThe legal notice suggests that U.S.-origin nuclear reactor technology and material have been used to build up Chinese nuclear forces, which are part of a major rapid expansion.\n\nThe bureau stated in a Federal Register notice Aug. 14 that the four nuclear entities were added to the blacklist of foreign companies that must first obtain an export license before acquiring U.S. goods and that the license requirement will be based on \u201ca presumption of denial.\u201d The notice said the companies \u201cpose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe companies were the China General Nuclear Power Group, China General Nuclear Power Corp. (CGNPC), China Nuclear Power Technology Research Institute Co. Ltd., and Suzhou Nuclear Power Research Institute Co. Ltd.\n\nThe four firms were engaged in or enabled efforts to acquire U.S. nuclear technology and material \u201cfor diversion to military uses in China.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, an American born in Taiwan, Szuhsiung Ho, was sentenced to two years in prison for his role in setting up a group of American nuclear experts who helped China develop nuclear materials. Court papers in the case identified the CGNPC, Beijing\u2019s largest nuclear producer, as a company seeking to obtain U.S. design information for nuclear reactors.\n\nThe Trump administration announced last year that it is seeking to prevent China from using American technology for floating nuclear power reactors in the disputed South China Sea. China has built some 3,200 acres of islands and last year deployed anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles on the islands along with electronic jamming gear.\n\nThe crackdown on Chinese nuclear firms is in sharp contrast to Obama administration policies that sought to facilitate deals between U.S. nuclear power companies and Chinese firms.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton backed a bid by General Electric to export nuclear technology to China in exchange for promises that China would not steal or transfer the technology. Under the terms of a 2003 agreement on nuclear technology cooperation, China agreed not to divert U.S. know-how.\n\nA Hong Kong company, Corad Technology Ltd., was also sanctioned for acting as a front for illicit transfers of U.S. technology.\n\nCorad was involved, according to the notice, in \u201cthe sale of U.S. technology to Iran\u2019s military and space programs, to front companies of [North Korea], and to subordinate entities of China\u2019s government and its defense industry.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
