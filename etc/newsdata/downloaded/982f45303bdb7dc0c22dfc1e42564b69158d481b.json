In my opinion he's not fit and proper,' she said.\n\nTwo girls who are regulars at the venue said that Friday night is the quietest they'd ever seen it in the club\n\nMs Macleod has penned a formal letter of complaint to the Director of Liquor Licensing and Liquor Enforcement Unit.\n\n'I think his behaviour is pretty reprehensible in how he's responded,' Ms Macleod told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nMs Macleod said she was shocked by his comments and how he continued to victimise Ms Smith.\n\n'I was pretty aghast. The whole purpose of our liquor act are to minimise the harm that's associated with alcohol. He failed to take it seriously, he failed to look into it.'\n\n'It was such a terrible response repeatedly. You can't say these things to people.'\n\nMs Macleod sent the letter to the authority early last week and has been notified it is being looked into.\n\nRapture nightclub owner Neil Temple Scott, 66, ridiculed a young woman who complained that her drink was spiked last Saturday night\n\nThe uproar began after Shantel Smith, 19, sent the nightclub a message via Facebook saying she believed she had been spiked\n\nThe 19-year-old described the nightclub's response as 'disgusting'\n\nThe uproar began after Ms Smith sent the nightclub a message via Facebook saying she believed she had been spiked.\n\nThe 19-year-old said she had only had two or three drinks before entering the club and then one at the premises.\n\nMs Smith then said she spent the next two and a half hours vomiting and experiencing other 'symptoms of a date rape drug.'\n\nShe said she didn't see any bouncers near the bar and suggested the club beef up its security to protect its reputation.\n\nBut Mr Scott was unconvinced, sending back a scathing response and questioning why anyone would try to spike her drink.\n\n'Why would anyone want to spike your drink? Did you attend a hospital and have your stomach pumped for evidence?' the response read, as shared by Ms Smith online.\n\n'Are you worth someone trying to spike your drink?\n\nWhat Ms Smith sent Rapture's Facebook page after her night out that prompted Mr Scott's response\n\n'We think this is a beat up and we believe that no one would be stupid enough to waste their drugs on spiking anyone's drink.'\n\nSpeaking with Daily Mail Australia, Mr Scott said that Ms Smith had created a 'fairytale' as part of her 'desire to be important', but he refused to believe it.\n\n'I've dealt with spoilt kids before. This one felt so entitled she posted my response which was designed to wake her up to the real world,' he said.\n\n'Her multiple scenarios in the story would have the same odds of being true as the winner of the $100million Powerball.'\n\nMr Scott stood by his controversial comments, telling 7 News: 'I'm not sorry and I don't regret it ... the woman wasn't attractive, particularly, and she was a bit overweight but that wasn't what it was about.'\n\nMr Scott remained unphased by the small protest and even claimed it was 'good publicity.'\n\nWhen she reported the alleged incident to the venue, Rapture Nightclub in Perth, it sent her this response instead of apologising\n\nSpeaking with 9 News after the incident, the club's owner shamed the young woman, labelling her as 'not particularly attractive'.\n\n'Lets face it, why would somebody spike her drink? Why would they do that? What are they hoping to get? What is she hoping to get from it?' Mr Scott said.\n\n'I don't know if she thinks she's special enough to be spiked, I don't know if that's how it works.'\n\nMr Scott then told the West Australian the 'plain Jane' teenager had more than likely made up the story for attention, adding she never reported the spiking incident to any of the Rapture staff.\n\n'She's not a particularly attractive girl. It's just implausible to imagine that she had her drink spiked, it just doesn't sort of add up.'\n\n'She's just a very plain Jane type of girl. I can't understand why anybody would be possessed by her.'\n\nMs Smith described the nightclub's response as 'disgusting'.\n\nMr Scott early on Monday morning he posted CCTV of Ms Smith entering the leaving the club to support his claim that her drink was never spiked\n\n'The response I received was absolutely disgusting after the message I sent them was extremely polite and just requesting they increase their security,' she said.\n\nHe also posted CCTV of Ms Smith at the club, claiming it as proof her drink couldn't have been spiked.\n\n'The large girl with the white top, the short black skirt and the black and white shoes is Shantel Smith, the girl who claimed to have had her drink spiked,' he wrote.\n\n'She can be seen entering Rapture Nightclub at 10.58pm and leaving at 2.53am. Note none of her friends seems perturbed at all.\n\n'She seems in good spirits and did not leave the club once in the 2 hours 55 minutes of attendance. Nor did she seek help or assistance from any of the 14 staff on duty.'\n\nMr Scott was vilified for posting the CCTV footage online with hundreds of angry punters threatening to boycott the venue.\n\n'Regardless if this young girl was in fact spiked at your club is besides the point. You victimised and humiliated her,' one woman wrote.", "description": "Neil Scott, the owner of Perth club Rapture denied the claims of 19-year-old Shantel Smith who reported she had her drink spiked at the venue earlier this month.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee", "Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/07/19978456-0-image-a-2_1571638470990.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
