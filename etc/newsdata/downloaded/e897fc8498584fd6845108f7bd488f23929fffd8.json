The actions of Mr. Comey and others constitute all-out treason, which used to warrant a firing squad. These are government officials who were given an opportunity to serve us, and they all took an oath to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThese are department leaders of the intel community who abused their positions in group fashion. Appropriate penalties include complete loss of job, pay and pension. Then, a grand jury ought to determine how to discipline them all on an individual basis. This is called precedent. It\u2019s how the legal system determines punishment. As it stands now, there is no discipline of any kind.\n\nSTEPHEN MOUNGELIS\n\nMt.
