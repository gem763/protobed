REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nJohnson asked Queen Elizabeth to prorogue, or suspend, parliament from Sept. 10 until Oct. 14, prompting accusations from opponents that he wanted to silence the legislature in the run-up to Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union on Oct. 31.\n\nJames Eadie, a lawyer for Johnson, told the court that the ability to prorogue parliament was a matter of politics or \u201chigh policy\u201d which was non-justiciable, meaning it was not something judges could rule on.\n\nIt was a matter for parliament to hold the government to account, not the courts, he said, arguing that lawmakers could hold a vote of no-confidence in the government if they wished.\n\n\u201cThese are political judgments,\u201d he said.\n\nThe question of justiciability is likely to be key to which way the Supreme Court goes. A ruling is expected on Friday at the earliest.\n\nJohnson, who is not appearing in person at the Supreme Court, had said he needed the suspension to bring in a new legislative agenda. Critics asserted that the real reason was to thwart parliament\u2019s efforts to stop him from leading the country out of the EU with or without an agreed divorce deal.\n\nThe Supreme Court began holding three days of hearings on Tuesday to decide whether Johnson\u2019s advice to the queen regarding the suspension was unlawful.\n\nA ruling against him would be a major embarrassment for Johnson, who has no majority in parliament and has suffered one defeat after another in the House of Commons since taking office in July.\n\nCONFLICTING RULINGS\n\nThe Supreme Court heard from another government lawyer on Tuesday that if Johnson lost the case, he could recall parliament earlier than planned.\n\nThe High Court in London ruled earlier this month that the suspension was not a judicial issue, regardless of whether it was motivated by political calculations.\n\nHowever, in a conflicting judgment, Scotland\u2019s highest court said last week that the suspension was unlawful and an \u201cegregious\u201d attempt to stymie parliament.\n\nA lawyer for businesswoman and activist Gina Miller, one of the people taking legal action over the suspension, told the court on Tuesday that no other prime minister had abused the power to prorogue parliament in this way for 50 years.\n\nHe said there was strong evidence that Johnson wanted to silence parliament because he saw it as an obstacle, and said it was \u201cremarkable\u201d Johnson had not provided a witness statement spelling out his reasons for the prorogation.\n\nJohnson has denied misleading the queen. Government lawyer Richard Keen said on Tuesday only seven working days would be lost through the suspension, not five weeks, because parliament would be on holiday in late September as parties held annual conferences.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled against the government in a similar constitutional case in 2017, also brought by Miller, when it said ministers could not begin the formal two-year exit process without the approval of parliament.\n\nAt the start of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Brenda Hale, the court\u2019s president, said the current case was a legal issue and would have no direct bearing on when and how the United Kingdom left the EU.", "description": "Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament is a political issue and not a matter for judges, a lawyer for the prime minister said on Wednesday as he sought to persuade the British Supreme Court that the five-week shutdown was lawful.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431135082&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0FE", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
