In the initial phase, there were many business models linked to advertising.\n\nThe already known \"faucets\", and the PTCs (Paid To Click) were a viable way of acquiring small portions of cryptocurrencies to go deep into this world. Then multiple problems arrived and only the best projects have survived.\n\nAnd today we introduce you one of those projects that have adapted and improved over time to continue having a place in the saturated world of internet advertising: BTC Surf.\n\nWhat is BTC Surf?\n\nBTC Surf is a community, developed by the professionals of the Spanish Blockchain Association. Anyone can register for free and enjoy various benefits (depending on the type of membership).\n\nDepending on the activity in the community you can earn Bitcoins, you can earn traffic for your web portal or meet new portals and investment opportunities.\n\nAdvertise forever\n\nMembers can advertise with a single payment and enjoy the service for a lifetime. In this way, the advertiser will be able to receive traffic from real users throughout his life and thus increase his yields.\n\nThose users who do not wish to advertise can also earn while they see ads from the partners that are advertised, and also know quality alternatives that are being promoted by the other members of the community.\n\nOther sources of benefits: The Affiliate System\n\nApart from the normal activity of the community, it can also be earned by recommending the platform to other users, with which we will subsequently earn a percentage of the profits that are generated later thanks to that user. The BTC surf affiliate network is up to 11 levels deep (for the highest memberships).\n\nClarity with financials\n\nThe distribution of money generated by the community is a clear system designed with transparency to guarantee confidence in the system.\n\nThe distribution is as follows:\n\n\u2022 50% - Membership plan distributed in 11 levels.\n\n\u2022 20% - External Surfing Promotion for all advertisers, generating visits from other traffic sources.\n\n\u2022 10% - Weekly Bonus.\n\n\u2022 10% - Random bonus per activity.\n\n\u2022 10% - Management and maintenance of BTCSURF systems\n\nThe newest: The pool\n\nThe latest and most innovative service that BTC Surf partners offer us is the \u201cpool\u201d. When we talk about pool we do not mention what we all know as a mining pool. A pool, in general, is a group of people (or companies) that come together to offer a service or take advantage of a business opportunity.\n\nIn this case, the Pool offered by BTC Surf is intended to exploit the affiliate network market. With the contributions of the members of the community, the affiliate networks of top quality portals within the Bitcoin universe and cryptocurrencies are exploited.\n\nNext, let us show the chart of profitability of the pool.\n\nAs can be seen in the above graph, profitability ranges between 0.20% and 1% of daily gain. Which is a fairly profitable investment if we consider the tremendous competition in the internet advertising market.\n\nIn addition, the pool evolves as the community decides since they will make investments in the portals that the members themselves decide: a tool for the community!\n\nConclusion\n\nBTC Surf is a mature, profitable community that continues to innovate to offer profitable services for its community, as evidenced by the recent launch of its commission POOL.\n\nWeb: BTC Surf", "description": "Disclaimer: The text below is a sponsored article.\r _________\r \r If you have been in the world of cryptocurrencies for a long time, you should have experienced the evolution of the business models.
