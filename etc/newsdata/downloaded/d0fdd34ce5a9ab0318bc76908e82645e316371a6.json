In a new interview with BUILD, the actress revealed that she just recently realized that she's held onto feelings of insecurity and pain caused by the public scrutiny following her split from Brady\u2014but she's \"shedding\" those feelings now.\n\nMoynahan became a tabloid fixture when she revealed she was pregnant with Brady's child in 2007, months after they had broken up. The football star had also moved on to date his now-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen at the time. The actress recalled being followed by paparazzi during her pregnancy, which took a toll on her.\n\n\n\n\"I had a public breakup and then I was pregnant and then I had a baby,\" she said, according to Yahoo! Entertainment. \"And those moments were kind of stolen from me by the paparazzi, the tabloids, whatever.\"\n\nMoynahan noticed that she still acts in a certain way because of how that time in the unwanted spotlight affected her. \"If I was going into a public space still or walking through the streets, sometimes I change my posture or hide a little bit because of that period of time. Because of that attention that was unwanted,\" she explained.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Peter Kramer - Getty Images More\n\nHowever, she was able to confront and start to change those habits through writing her new book, Our Shoes, Our Selves, which features stories from women who link significant times in their lives with a pair of shoes. In the book, co-written by Amanda Benchley, Moynahan shared her own story of buying motorcycle boots as a \"security blanket\" during her post-breakup tumult.\n\n\"I feel like this project has kind of shown that to me that I still unconsciously carried that around with me,\" she said in her BUILD interview. \"And so I\u2019m still working through that and kind of shedding that now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBrady and Moynahan now co-parent their 11-year-old son, Jack. Earlier this month, she told People how both of their respective partners (B\u00fcndchen and Moynahan's current husband, Andrew Frankel) also play a part in the parenting.\n\n\"Tom and I made a decision to raise a child together and we both found partners that not only supported us in raising that child, but also loved our child as if he was their own,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can ask for more than that. My son is surrounded by love.\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"I still unconsciously carried that around with me.\"", "authors": ["Erica Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9nhvamFJmskrYOLrymasVg--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/good_housekeeping_561/54130bd81192b7b038aa4400eb67c25a", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
