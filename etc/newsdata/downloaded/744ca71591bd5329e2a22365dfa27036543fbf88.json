Or at least, bad for your face.\n\nIf anyone had seen me (and I made sure they didn\u2019t) after watching \u00adseveral episodes of Modern Love on Amazon Prime on Friday, they would have been horrified.\n\nNoisy sobbing, mascara \u00adstreaming, blotchy cheeks.\n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s supposed to a romantic comedy \u2013 but each episode of this anthology delivered a sucker punch to my poor, bleeding heart.\n\nThe show is inspired by the New York Times column of the same name, which publishes readers\u2019 tales of love in all its glorious and complex forms.\n\n(Image: Amazon Studios)\n\nAnd to bring to life eight of the stories, why not cast a starry line-up of actors, including Anne Hathaway, Andy Garcia, Tina Fey and Andrew \u201cHot Priest\u201d Scott?\n\nThe opening titles of people hugging and kissing throughout the ages is a bit like that nauseating Love Actually airport scene. Enough to give me concern that this was going to be as saccharine as a sweet shop.\n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised. While each stand-alone episode delivers like a mini Hollywood movie, the subject matter isn\u2019t all glamour and gloss.\n\nCristin Milioti, the star of How I Met Your Mother, is a single woman with a slightly weird but sweet relationship with her over-protective Albanian doorman.\n\n\u201cI did not like him. He will never be calling you,\u201d says the doorman, of her \u00adlatest date. He becomes a father figure as she prepares to be a single mum.\n\n(Image: Amazon Studios)\n\nElsewhere, Anne Hathaway gives an absolutely knockout performance as a woman struggling with bipolar.\n\nHer life swings from full-on La La Land, dancing in supermarkets, singing in sequins, to hiding under her duvet for days on end as the \u201cmonster\u201d of depression takes hold.\n\nIn another episode, Dev Patel is the brilliant founder of a dating app who is being interviewed by a journalist who wants to know if he\u2019s ever been in love.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThere\u2019s a pause. \u201cI don\u2019t have to print it,\u201d she says. Print what? \u201cThat story that\u2019s written all over your face.\u201d Cue the love story.\n\nSure, the series can be a bit cheesy sometimes. There is more than one \u00admontage.\n\nMontages should be left where they belong \u2013 in Richard Curtis movies.\n\nBut I was fully invested in these \u00adrelationships in just half-hour episodes.\n\nIt\u2019s a mixed bag of scenarios, and some episodes are better than others. Sharon Horgan penned the episode with Tina Fey and John Slattery as a couple considering separation, but it fell flat for me.\n\nMostly, Modern Love treads that fine line between sweet but not sickly, funny but with depth. Pick and choose which ones you fancy \u2013 just don\u2019t watch them all at once unless you have defibrillator.", "description": "Each episode of Modern Love on Amazon Prime delivered a sucker punch to my poor, bleeding heart", "authors": ["Will Rankin", "Image", "Amazon Studios", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20656608.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Modern-Love.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
