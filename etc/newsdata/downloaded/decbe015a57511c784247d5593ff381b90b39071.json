Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nAbout half of LGBTQ people in the U.S. \u2013 52% \u2013 live in states where they could be fired, nixed for a promotion, refused training or harassed at their jobs, all because of their gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nIt is a number that comes as a thunderbolt to many who assume in 2019 laws are more inclusive, rights advocates say \u2013 and it underlines the urgency of a trio of cases the Supreme Court is weighing Tuesday that could guarantee federal protections for LGBTQ workers nationwide.\n\n\u201cMost Americans are shocked to learn that we lack explicit laws protecting LGBTQ people from being fired for who they are or who they love,\u201d said Naomi Goldberg, policy research director for the Movement Advancement Project (MAP), a think tank that maintains a database on laws affecting LGBTQ people. \u201cThe fact that 52% of LGBTQ adults live in states without explicit protections means that the cases before the Supreme Court are even more consequential.\u201d\n\nIn cases viewed by some as monumental as the 2015 gay marriage ruling, justices will hear challenges from New York, Michigan and Georgia involving workers who say they were fired because they were gay or transgender. The cases center on whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin and sex, prohibits bias against LGBTQ people.\n\nWhile Title VII doesn\u2019t explicitly cite sexual orientation or gender identity as separate protected categories, certain federal and state agencies, some courts \u2013 and significantly, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \u2013 have recognized Title VII\u2019s protections against \u201csex\u201d bias as applying to LGBTQ people.\n\nThe Supreme Court will soon hear cases regarding LGBTQ employment protections, which are seen by some as crucial as the 2015 gay marriage ruling. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP)\n\nRight now, LGBTQ people \u2013 even in states that haven\u2019t outlawed discrimination \u2013 can seek recourse for workplace discrimination through the EEOC.\n\nBut if the Supreme Court rules LGBTQ people are not protected, it would \u201cinvalidate the EEOC\u2019s current practice of accepting and processing\u201d bias charges, said Greg Nevins, senior counsel at Lambda Legal. The EEOC \u201cwill proceed according to how the court rules.\u201d\n\nCases among the most crucial of 2019: Gay rights battle against employment discrimination extends beyond the grave\n\nHow many people are affected?\n\nAbout 4.5% of the U.S. population identifies as LGBTQ or an estimated 11 million people, of which 88% are employed, according to a 2018 report by MAP and the National LGBTQ Workers Center.\n\nIf the court rules that LGBTQ workers are not protected under Title VII, rights advocates fear the same reasoning will also upend other protections nationwide.\n\n'A diverse workforce': More than 200 companies tell Supreme Court to apply job discrimination laws to sexual orientation, gender identity\n\n\u201cThe stakes in these cases for LGBTQ people couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s because there are many places in federal law where discrimination based on sex is prohibited \u2013 in housing, education, health care and credit.\u201d If the court doesn\u2019t affirm Title VII protections, much is at risk, she said.\n\nAnd, on the flip side, if the court affirms rulings from the EEOC and various appeals courts, the decision would permeate other areas, she said. \"It would be important for creating clear, national understanding that discrimination against LGBTQ people is illegal.\"\n\nWhat protections are in place right now?\n\nA jumbled patchwork of state laws, local ordinances and conflicting court rulings now make up the discrimination rulebook.\n\nOnly 21 states, the District of Columbia and two territories (Guam and Puerto Rico) have laws on the books explicitly banning bias in the workplace based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n'A long time coming': Ex-funeral home worker\u2019s case going to Supreme Court\n\nNew York became the latest state in January to add gender identity to its anti-discrimination laws, which cover employment, after a years-long effort. The state passed the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act in 2002, but a gender non-discrimination bill never followed until this year.\n\nMore than 280 city and county ordinances also ban discrimination \u2013 and those should not be overlooked, rights advocates say. For example, about 60% of people in Florida, a state lacking explicit bias laws, live in cities or counties with local employment protections, according to MAP.\n\nWhat is the current landscape for protections?\n\nThe situation is complicated, Goldberg said. Because laws differ from state to state, a worker could be fired in one state, protected in another. EEOC rulings also aren\u2019t always binding on small, private employers; there are court decisions that lack agreement.\n\nAnd sometimes state human rights commissions weigh in. For example, Michigan's non-discrimination law doesn\u2019t explicitly cite sexual orientation or gender identity, but the Michigan Civil Rights Commission has stated it interprets the state\u2019s laws to include protections for both.\n\n\u201cCurrently some federal appeals courts have ruled that yes, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal \u2026 or yes, discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal \u2026 or no, neither is prohibited,\u201d Goldberg said. A Supreme Court ruling that Title VII prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity would provide blanket protections and clarity, she said.\n\nSmashing stereotypes: Nearly 4 million LGBTQ people live in rural America, and 'everything is not bias and awful'\n\nHow one town changed: This Kentucky town changed its views on LGBTQ rights\n\nHow common is discrimination?\n\nTwenty-five percent of LGBTQ people reported experiencing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity \u2013 half of whom said it negatively impacted their work environment, according to the 2018 MAP report.\n\nTwenty-seven percent of transgender workers reported being fired, not hired or denied a promotion in 2016-2017, the report says.\n\nTolerance down: The young are regarded as the most tolerant generation. That's why results of this LGBTQ survey are 'alarming'\n\nAnd about half of the more than 9,000 LGBTQ-related claims filed with the EEOC from 2012-2016 were from states lacking explicit protections for LGBTQ workers.\n\nCould existing protections be overturned?\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules that Title VII does not protect LGBTQ workers, the decision will not remove any existing employment protections for the 48% of the LGBTQ population in states with protective laws. The decision also will not thwart any local ordinances banning workplace bias, nor will it change state court interpretations of state sex discrimination laws, according to MAP.\n\nBut with the EEOC no longer being able to validate such discrimination charges, half of LGBTQ workers would become even more vulnerable, advocates say.\n\nThe battle for rights: 3 years after same-sex marriage ruling, protections for families undermined\n\nAbove all, what is needed is the passage of the federal Equality Act, regardless of how the court rules, says Lambda Legal\u2019s Nevins. The act, which passed the House earlier this year, will assure \u201call the protections the court can provide and more,\u201d in employment, housing and beyond, he said.\n\nStill, a Title VII victory would be pivotal. \u201cIt will confirm a basic truth: that anti-LGBTQ discrimination is sex discrimination,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf Don and Donna date men, and you fire only Don, what else is that?\u201d\n\nMore: Supreme Court returns to work facing abortion, guns, immigration, gay rights -- and possibly President Trump\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/08/lgbt-employment-discrimination-half-of-states-offer-no-protections/3837244002/", "description": "The Supreme Court will soon decide whether it's illegal under a 1964 law to fire someone based on their gender identity and sexual orientation.", "authors": ["Susan Miller", "Published A.M.
