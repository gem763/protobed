When they ran out of fuel, the pilots parachuted into a field near the small town of Creil, 50 kilometres from Paris.\n\nA telegram sent to Jan Stein Rosinski's brother who lived in Venezuela\n\nThe story that follows is the result of piecing together letters, telegrams, video and photographs owned and preserved by the descendants of our protagonists, as well as historic files from the French Resistance. They have been shared with Euronews by Axel Stein, nephew of Jan Stein.\n\nA few days later, Jan Stein Rosinski \u2013 whose name was changed by his Polish commander to Jan Rosinski to avoid any association with Germany during the war \u2013 and his pilot took refuge at a farm in Rieux, 11 kilometres north of Creil.\n\nThe French Resistance helped him and his colleague find the farm, as the Gestapo in Creil was actively looking for the pair.\n\nFarmer Louis Lannoye, his wife Antoinette and his family agreed \u201cfrom the heart\u201d to protect and hide both Jan and Tadeusz. \u201cThey risked their lives,\u201d recounts Jan's nephew Axel, \u201cthe family would have been executed if the Germans had found out they were hiding Allied airmen.\"\n\nExtract from a report by the French Resistance\n\nThe men stayed at the Lannoye farm for five weeks, where they were fed and taken care of. The family, along with the French Resistance, later helped the Polish duo escape to safety through occupied France, Bordeaux, Spain and Gibraltar to the United Kingdom, where they arrived on 11 June, 1944, five days after the D-Day landings.\n\nA telegram sent to Jan Stein Rosinski's brother who lived in Venezuela\n\nRepatriation certificate of Jan Stein Rosinski\n\nThere, Jan Stein joined his wife and his newborn baby, Ian, and continued flying for the Polish Air Force until the end of the war. He visited his \u201crescuers\u201d, as he came to call them, in November 1944, and then again for the last time in 1952.\n\nOne afternoon in October 2017, Axel Stein was asked by a colleague and aviation enthusiast about the aeroplane his uncle Jan flew during the war. It was a Havilland Mosquito, a British bomber aircraft which became famous for its rather unusual balsa wood body cover. Axel promised to send his colleague a photo and looked for pictures of the plane that his cousin Ian, Jan's son, had shared a couple of years before.\n\n\u201cI started looking in each of the emails my cousin had ever sent me. I found the Mosquito photos, along with another one of my uncle, posing with his fellow pilot and two other people, with a note that read \u2018with our helpers, the Lannoye [family], Rieux, Oise, France\u2019.\"\n\nOvercome with curiosity, Axel decided to send an email to the Mayor of Rieux, whose details he found online.\n\n\u201cDear Madame, Monsieur,\n\nI write to you at this time to ask if by any chance you have a family in your community called LANNOYE.\n\nWhile digging through the family archives, we found a photo of our uncle, the Polish navigator Jan Stein Rosinski whose plane was shot near Rieux in 1944 and hidden by the couple you see in the photo, identified as the Lannoye.\n\nIf there are still survivors of this family, we would like to know if you would be so kind as to put us in contact. We would like to personally thank the descendants for this act of courage and patriotism.\n\nThank you in advance for your kind reply to this email coming to you from New York.\n\nAxel Stein\u201d\n\nFive hours later, Axel got his response.\n\n\u201cDear Axel Stein,\n\nIt is with great emotion that I read your e-mail from New York!\n\n(...)\n\nThe answer to your question is: YES, YES. The descendants of the LANNOYE family are still in Rieux.\n\nI myself remember Jan Stein, who was hidden by my parents, Louis and Antoinette LANNOYE, farmers in Rieux (Oise). I am their daughter, Denise LANNOYE, widow of SCHROBILTGEN, and Mayor of Rieux for many years. I was born in 1935 and was very young when Jan was with us. I have pictures and short films where your uncle appears.\n\n(...)\n\nThe correspondence between us shall begin, those who have lived before us are now uniting us with their history, their courage and their example.\n\nVery warm greetings to you and your whole family.\n\nDenise SCHROBILTGEN, born LANNOYE,\n\nMayor of RIEUX.\u201d\n\nAnd the correspondence did indeed begin. From the date of that first contact between Axel and Denise, and Denise\u2019s daughter Elvire Laroche, it took two years to arrange a meeting. The date was set for 7 September this year, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of Jan\u2019s first return visit to the farm after he had escaped to the UK.\n\nAround 50 members of the Lannoye and Stein families, including two of Jan\u2019s sons, Ian and Michael, came together and celebrated in true French fashion, with plenty of good food and wine.\n\n1 2 The Stein cousins with Denise Schrobiltgen at the 75th anniversary of Jan\u2019s first \u201cvisit\u201d to the farm 1 2 Members of the Lannoye and Stein families 1 2 Denise Schrobiltgen speaks at the 75th anniversary of Jan\u2019s first visit 1 2 The two families come together in France in September 1 2 Around 50 members of the Stein and the Lannoye families met 1 2 Axel Stein and Elvire Laroche, Denise's daughter 1 2 Poster made for the Lannoye-Stein reunion 1 2 Jan Stein Rosinski during his war days 1 2 The families marked the occasion with a specially made cake 1 2 The Lannoye family farm as it would have looked in 1944 1 2 The Lannoye family farm today 1 2 The photo that started it all 1 2 Various photos of Jan Stein Rosinski 1 2 Various photos of Jan Stein Rosinski - Bello, Camille 1 2 The Lannoye family with Jan Stein and Tadeusz Ciula in 1944\n\nThe families now want to make a documentary about their shared past.
