As casualties mount, around 750 ISIS detainees escaped Kurdish custody following a Turkish airstrike. Turkey appears to be expanding well beyond Ankara\u2019s intention for a \u201csafe zone\u201d along its border, leading to mass displacement: UNICEF reports that this week nearly 70,000 children have been uprooted because of the conflict. Turkish-backed militants have killed Kurdish politicians, and civilian deaths have risen to at least 39. To stave off a massacre, the Kurdish SDF alliance signed an protection deal with the al-Assad regime, and Syrian forces have moved into their former territory.\n\nJust as swift as the new, developments in the eight-year Syrian Civil War \u2014 though profoundly less impactful \u2014 were Republican condemnations of the president\u2019s decision. As Party leaders defended the president for his scandal in Ukraine, reliable allies like Lindsey Graham and Liz Cheney called Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds a \u201cdisaster in the making\u201d and \u201ca catastrophic mistake.\u201d To help appease his critics, Trump responded on Monday with the announcement of pending sanctions against Turkey for the invasion of Syria.\n\nStatement from President Donald J.
