We are asking why we have so many people in Europe when we\u2019ve got double-digit returns in parts of Asia.\u201d\n\nThe London-headquartered bank last month announced the shock exit of CEO John Flint after just 18 months in the hot seat but gave no reason for the decision.\n\nAt the same time it revealed it would axe two percent of its global workforce, or roughly 4,000 mostly management jobs, in a new restructuring aimed at weathering the global turmoil.\n\nStill, its reported first-half net profit rose 18.6 percent on-year to $8.5 billion.\n\nIt is due to report third-quarter earnings at the end of October.\n\nThe cost-cutting drive is in line with other lenders who are battling global headwinds.\n\nUS banks including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have lowered their 2019 profit forecasts tied to interest rates as central banks around the world loosen monetary policy in response to a weakening global growth outlook.\n\nLower interest rates mean less profit on loans made by the banks, especially if they have offered higher returns on deposits to attract customers.\n\nAnd last month Germany\u2019s second-largest lender Commerzbank said it plans to cut the equivalent of 4,300 full-time posts \u2014 a tenth of its workforce \u2014 and shut 200 branches as it restructures.\n\nDeutsche Bank has announced 18,000 job cuts and France\u2019s Societe Generale 1,600.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 HSBC is planning to lay off up to 10,000 staff, a report said Monday, just weeks after its chief executive stepped down and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/f22491_banking-giant-is-one-lenders-struggling-global-slowdown-falling-rates-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
