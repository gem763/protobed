I think the comparison may be stark but WeWork has a lot of questions to answer. And as of now, we haven't seen a lot of answers for them.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the We Company, the parent company of WeWork, was rethinking its strategy to take the company public ahead of its highly-anticipated IPO. The company is reportedly reconsidering its previously set target of up to $30 billion and may lower that closer to $20 billion. This comes after the company's last funding raise valued it at close to $47 billion.\n\nAs WeWork faces tough criticism over its valuation, It appears investors are checking themselves this time around and not getting swept up in IPO mania. Davda said companies that can deliver growth and profitability will be rewarded \u201cextremely well\u201d but notes while WeWork has delivered growth they need to raise cash in order to do so. And according to Davda, that\u2019s a big problem.\n\n\u201dThey need cash to grow. They need growth for cash,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think what we're seeing Wall Street say to WeWork is, if you want our cash, we need to see how you're going to become profitable.\u201d\n\nSoftbank\u2019s role\n\nCredit: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the bigger questions is what does the WeWork IPO mean for Softbank, which has a large position in WeWork via its Vision Fund.\n\n\u201cIs Softbank going to double down on WeWork giving it a lifeline to go until next year or potentially go public above a $20 billion mark?\u201d he said. \u201cThe jury\u2019s out on that.\u201d\n\nWeWork may have to come to terms with the fact that \u201cthere\u2019s no reason for the company to trade trade at 26 times it sales, which is 25 times higher than its closest competitor, real estate company IWG.\u201d\n\nWhile WeWork may \u201chave brand value and better connect with today\u2019s workforce,\u201d said Davda, there\u2019s little proof, so far, justifying its current valuation.\n\n\n\nYvette Killian is a producer for Yahoo Finance\u2019s On The Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nShaq on investing: 'I don\u2019t ever think about making money'\n\nWeWork 'has to give us a valuation that's reasonable': IPO expert\n\n5G will make devices more vulnerable to cyberattacks: Akamai CEO\n\nUS bankruptcy filings rose in July 2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nGold prices can go a 'good deal higher': strategist\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "WeWork needs to rethink its valuation, according to EquityZen CEO Atish Davda.", "authors": ["Yvette Killian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/U8mD0_7WyVL8SOWUznYevg--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9MTQ0MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/a6c16290-d340-11e9-b7f2-cda866ecf170", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
