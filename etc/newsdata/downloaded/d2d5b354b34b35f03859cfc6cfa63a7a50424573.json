The dollar was confined to a narrow range versus the yen as\n\ntraders weighed the prospect of U.S. interest rate cuts against\n\ntheir demand for safe-haven assets.\n\nAmong Asian currencies, the yuan got off to a subdued start\n\nafter the soft trade data.\n\n\"The Chinese numbers play to the view that if we don't see\n\nprogress in U.S.-China trade talks, then further easing will be\n\nnecessary, including tolerance of a weaker yuan,\" said Ray\n\nAttrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia\n\nBank in Sydney.\n\n\"The ECB is the big game in town globally this week, and the\n\nmarket is more comfortable with the Federal Reserve cutting\n\nrates, so I think the market is probably risk neutral.\"\n\nSterling edged lower as political uncertainty about how the\n\nUK would complete its divorce with the European Union by an Oct.\n\n31 deadline dented appetite for the pound.\n\nTraders are likely to take their cues from the ECB as major\n\ncentral banks line up support measures for a weakening global\n\neconomy.\n\nThe euro was little changed at $1.10235 early in\n\nAsian trading after falling 0.1% on Friday.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2288 GBP=D3 after falling 0.4% on\n\nFriday.\n\nThe =USD against a basket of six major\n\ncurrencies rose 0.03% to 98.447.\n\nThe dollar traded at 106.96 yen , up 0.04% from\n\nFriday.\n\nTrading could be subdued as one of the strongest typhoons to\n\nhit Tokyo in recent years made landfall on Monday, cancelling\n\nscores of train lines. The European Central Bank is all but certain to approve new\n\nstimulus measures on Thursday to boost an ailing economy, but\n\nthe composition of its package is far from clear as a rift has\n\nopened between hawkish northern European policymakers and doves\n\nfrom the south.
