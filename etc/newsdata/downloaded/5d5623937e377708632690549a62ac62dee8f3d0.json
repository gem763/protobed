The Italians used to be part of the European Freedom and Direct Democracy group alongside UKIP, although some 5Star members did not feel at ease with the Brexit champion.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 5Stars said they welcome \"with satisfaction\" the decision of the Greens to open talks. \"We are ready to discuss with a constructive spirit on specific themes to reinforce together the green agenda of the next European Commission,\" the 5Star delegation said in a statement.\n\nBut some Green MEPs are unhappy. Damian Boeselager, a German Green MEP, said the Italians had practiced \"dictatorial governance\" and he would not support any tie-up.\n\n\"The @GreensEFA have decided to open a fact finding mission with @Mov5Stelle,\" Boeselager tweeted. \"How can this be real? The facts are there: a dictatorial governance, a populist approach to values & policies, & sect like treatment of (former) members!\"", "description": "Italian party\u2019s 14 MEPs don\u2019t belong to any group in the Parliament.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1156220929-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
