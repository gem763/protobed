A third straight setback could leave the team in danger of not making it out of the group stage of the Champions League for the first time since the 1989-90 season.\n\nComing off a demoralizing loss to promoted Mallorca in the Spanish league, Zidane needs to somehow put together a squad that is missing Luka Modric and Gareth Bale. Also not making the trip to Turkey are Lucas V\u00e1zquez and Marco Asensio, while there are doubts about Toni Kroos following a long injury layoff.\n\n\"We have injured players, it is what it is,\" Zidane said. \"We can't change the situation. That can't be used as an excuse. We have other players in the team and everyone has to show that they have what it takes to be here.\"\n\nZidane used an alternative squad in Saturday's loss at Mallorca, a result that cost the team the Spanish league lead. Modric and Bale didn't play and there was hope they could make it to Turkey, but the club said Sunday they have not yet fully recovered.\n\nIf Kroos is indeed able to play, Zidane will likely use him in the midfield along with Casemiro and youngster Federico Valverde. In attack, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior is likely to replace Bale alongside Karim Benzema and Eden Hazard, who didn't play in Mallorca because of the birth of his son.\n\nAfter a big loss at Paris Saint-Germain and a home draw against Club Brugge, Madrid is tied with Galatasaray at the bottom of Group A with one point. The Turkish team is ahead on goal difference. PSG leads with six points, four more than Club Brugge.\n\nHEALTHY BARCELONA\n\nWhile Madrid tries to avert a crisis, Barcelona is just starting to hit its stride.\n\nBarcelona was the team facing a wave of injuries early in the season, with players like Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez among those sidelined. But with most of the squad healthy again, Barcelona started thriving, and it will enter Wednesday's Champions League match at Slavia Prague coming off five straight wins in all competitions.\n\nMessi, Su\u00e1rez and Antoine Griezmann \u2014 Barcelona's much-hyped attacking trio \u2014 are finally clicking. They each scored in the team's 3-0 win over Eibar in the Spanish league on Saturday.\n\n\"At the end, the great players always find one another and can feel where the other one will make his run or a pass,\" Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said. \"They have worked and played well. And this is the reward.\"\n\nBarcelona is tied with Borussia Dortmund at the top of Group F with four points, three more than Slavia Prague and Inter Milan.\n\nJO\u00c3O F\u00c9LIX\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid's Champions League game against Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday will be the team's first without the injured Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, the 19-year-old Portuguese sensation who was the club's biggest offseason signing.\n\nF\u00e9lix hurt his ankle in the 1-1 draw against Valencia in the Spanish league on Saturday, a result that dropped Atl\u00e9tico to fifth place after nine matches.\n\nIn the Champions League, Atl\u00e9tico is tied with Juventus at the top of Group D with four points.\n\nLEE'S TEARS\n\nSouth Korea midfielder Lee Kang-in was in tears after being sent off in Valencia's 1-1 draw at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Saturday.\n\nThe 18-year-old Lee was shown a red card for a hard tackle about 10 minutes after coming on as a late substitute in the match in Madrid.\n\n\"It's tough, he was crying in the changing room,\" Valencia midfielder Gabriel Paulista said. \"He is a kid. He has a lot to learn. We've all gone through this and we need to be able to help him.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
