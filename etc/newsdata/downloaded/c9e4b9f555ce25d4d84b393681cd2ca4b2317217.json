Andre Henry, a black writer who served as Relevant\u2019s managing editor from October 2017 through July 2018, criticized the company after it promoted a podcast episode about race and the church on Twitter. Henry tweeted that the organization was \u201cnot committed at all to creating an antiracist culture internally to produce a race podcast with integrity.\u201d He later published a blog post on the platform Medium, titled \u201cBlack Christians Deserve Better Than Companies (And Churches) Like Relevant Media Group.\u201d\n\nRelevant\u2019s bimonthly magazine has a print circulation of about 50,000, and its podcasts attract 280,000 listeners monthly, according to its own promotional material.\n\nIn his blog post, Henry described an argument he had with Strang over coverage of Black History Month. Henry said his plans to post one article a day on the subject were met with complaints by Strang that the site would have to publish seven or eight articles each day to \u201coffset\u201d one article about race. While Henry kept his title, his editorial power was stripped after the exchange, he wrote.\n\nHenry said that when he first worked there, Relevant wanted to avoid taking any strong stances that could be polarizing, especially to a white, male, conservative-leaning readership. Editors were encouraged to \u201cstay above the fray\u201d when it came to controversial issues, he wrote, reflecting the priority that white evangelical organizations place on presenting a unified front.\n\n\u201cThey often employ centrist rhetoric about the alleged virtues of playing the middle,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn response to Henry\u2019s blog post, several former employees of the magazine wrote about their experiences on social media, describing the magazine as a toxic work environment.\n\nRebecca Flores, who was managing editor for Relevant, wrote in a blog post Friday that Henry\u2019s post confirmed her own experiences. In her post, she said that Strang suggested the magazine feature a black rapper with a noose around his neck as a \u201cshocking image to symbolize his lynching by white evangelical America\u201d after the rapper was criticized for his support of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nShe told him at a meeting that it was bad idea, she said. \u201cI just hoped he would trust me. Instead, Cameron Strang grew exasperated with me and I think we left it at having to agree to disagree.\u201d\n\nRyan Hamm, who worked at Relevant as an editor and managing editor from 2009 to 2012, told Religion News Service that Strang responded inappropriately to a discussion among magazine staffers about poor newsstand sales of an issue that featured a photo of the band the Roots on the cover.\n\n\u201c[Strang] said, as I recollect, \u2018Well maybe our audience doesn\u2019t want to see scary black men on the cover of Relevant,\u2019\u201d Hamm told RNS. \u201cAs soon as he said that, [I thought], \u2018If that\u2019s true, then I have no interest in writing for this audience, and I\u2019m done.\u2019\u201d Hamm is now employed at a nonprofit organization that fights religious persecution.\n\nOn Monday, Strang wrote that he was stepping aside. He described it as \u201ca sabbatical, or a leave of absence,\u201d rather than a resignation. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for my toxicity and insensitivity in leadership,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be that person anymore.\u201d\n\nStrang did not say who will step into his role as chief executive, adding that the magazine has 11 people on staff. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Washington Post.\n\nStrang said he would \u201cuse an extended period of time to engage a process of healing, growth and learning. I will be seeking counseling, as well as reaching out to Christian leaders about ways I can grow and better understand important issues, especially about race and equality.\u201d\n\nRelevant is seen by many in the evangelical world as a somewhat edgier publication, one that has been more critical of the Trump administration than other evangelical outlets. Strang\u2019s father, Steve Strang, runs Charisma magazine, which has been a platform for many pastors who support President Trump.\n\nIn 2008, Cameron Strang decided not to give a prayer at the Democratic National Convention as he had planned, citing a desire to not seem partisan. The magazine has tried to present a range of beliefs on political issues; for example, Strang visited Israel and the Palestinian territories and later argued for equal rights for Palestinians in the magazine. Relevant asks its readers to see immigration reform as a Christian issue and urges them to consider being \u201cpro-life\u201d as more than being antiabortion.\n\nThe controversy around Strang reflects the tendency of many evangelical leaders to focus on giving their \u201cconsumer base\u201d what they think they want, said Aaron Hanbury, who was editorial director for Relevant from 2015 to 2017.\n\n\u201cThis is how we get Instagramish, cliche-riddled evangelicalism,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nHanbury said he witnessed Strang behaving poorly as a manager, but those were issues he thought were common in other workplaces.\n\nIn an email to the Post on Tuesday morning, Hanbury clarified an earlier question from the Post of whether he personally witnessed Strang behaving in racist or racially insensitive ways.\n\n\u201cThe story Rebecca shared about the idea of photographing a rapper in a noose \u2014 I was in the room for that; it was actually in my office,\" he wrote. \"In trying to communicate that I don\u2019t own any particularly egregious stories \u2014 I\u2019m not the object of them \u2014 I think I mistakenly implied that I never witnessed or was privy to such instances.\u201d\n\nHe said he thinks that Strang\u2019s success despite his lack of skill reflects a broader problem: Evangelical leaders are promoted for reasons that have nothing to do with their competence as faith leaders.\n\n\u201cCameron, like countless evangelical celebs, is only a leader in the faith space because he started and leads something [in this case, a media company], and he\u2019s attractive, hip and publicly charismatic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe evangelicals have been far, far too quick to [equate] apparent financial-organizational success and aspirational personalities with faith leadership.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify what Aaron Hanbury witnessed during his time at Relevant.", "description": "Allegations of racially insensitive behavior were published by a former editor last week.", "authors": ["Sarah Pulliam Bailey", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/i5RKoYSMzY42qoJFYFI_VPlFZBs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CFZEJEWJ5JGO7K6PZXSVLCWWGE.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
