I was on the conference-call planning it, and we argued about whether or not \u201ccoup\u201d was the right word, whether to start at 5pm or 6pm, whether to protest daily or concentrate on the Saturday. We talked about demo-fatigue and sound systems, the far right \u2013 who, inexplicably, were marched by police straight through the #StopTheCoup march at the weekend \u2013 but nobody argued about whether or not we should be protesting.\n\nThe debate on our current crisis has concentrated on proroguing, but it is no more than the instrument of what has occurred: the executive has moved against the parliament. Not tricked it, outwitted it, bullied it, or won it round \u2013 moved explicitly against it. You cannot find precedent for this in the debates surrounding the Falklands war, or the national government of 1931; you\u2019re squarely on the territory of the English civil war. To watch it happen and accede to it with silence would be unpatriotic, an act of bad citizenship.\n\nPolitical philosophy made the point decades ago that authoritarians love disorder\n\nNevertheless, demonstrating leaves an uncomfortable sense of playing into the prime minister\u2019s hands \u2013 or more precisely, into those of Dominic Cummings (Johnson being hardly renowned for his over-arching game plan). Political philosophy made the point decades ago that authoritarians love disorder. It creates the spectacle of an unruly mob that legitimises acts of state violence. That could be symbolic \u2013 the development of a parallel narrative, in which pro-democracy protesters are seen as the lawbreakers for holding up traffic, exceeding the lawlessness of a government that overturns the rule of law. Or it could be a literal horse charge. Either way, the act of protesting opens up those possibilities. A completely supine population is difficult to characterise one way or the other \u2013 hard to demonise, impossible to kettle.\n\nSpecifically, the rallying cries suit Johnson\u2019s argument so well he could have written them himself. I have no problem with the word \u201ccoup\u201d. It has been charged with overstatement: it plainly is not. That it is a fancy foreign word, such as you might expect from the metropolitan elite, I wouldn\u2019t think twice about; the relentless degradation of discourse \u2013 you\u2019re arguing, you\u2019re losing, experts are for losers \u2013 is part of the problem we\u2019re facing, and I will not submit to its principles. The main issue with \u201ccoup\u201d is that no hashtag spells it the same way twice.\n\nBut \u201cno to no deal\u201d is a vexing double negative, since it leads inexorably to the idea that you\u2019d say \u201cyes to a deal\u201d. It is highly likely that this was the government\u2019s intention all along \u2013 that no deal improved their leverage all right, not with the EU but with British MPs. If they could amp up the perils, they could ultimately turn any objection to any new deal into an act of national sabotage. That\u2019s the point of the \u00a3100m advertising campaign, which is deliberately low on detail and intentionally terrifying. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019d leaked the Operation Yellowhammer no-deal planning document themselves, the vindictive dismissal of Sajid Javid\u2019s aide afterwards just an act of theatre. The only signal that this isn\u2019t the strategy is that Johnson doesn\u2019t seem to have the ghost of a plan for a deal.\n\n\u201cDefend democracy\u201d, meanwhile, allies demonstrators with MPs, in readiness for the \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election that is Johnson\u2019s chosen and safest territory. By the logic of his position \u2013 that the will of the people has been continually thwarted by the elites in Westminster \u2013 any defence of the rights of parliament becomes an argument in favour of those elites. Protesters are simultaneously a lawless rabble and the voice of the establishment. Having destroyed the Conservatives as a conservative party \u2013 pro-business, commonsense incrementalists \u2013 and now probably lost Scottish Tories, Johnson\u2019s only real prospect of power is as the leader of an English nationalist party. Ethno-nationalism sucks its rhetorical purpose from a hatred of the establishment, without which it\u2019s all bigotry and bunting.\n\nFresh anti-prorogation protests planned in 30 cities and towns Read more\n\nThis is very different territory to the protests against the Iraq war, for instance, where there had been no build-up of assertions beforehand about who the real, authentic people of Britain were, and whether or not they wanted to go to war. We have now had three years of wrangling: bold-faced assertions that 52% is an \u201coverwhelming\u201d majority; that they all want the same thing, the most extreme version of that thing; and that members of that majority are the authentic voices of Britain, and their opponents, by extension, are just phoney, moneyed, unserious defenders of the status quo.\n\nIt is a bind, and an inevitable one: the principles of democracy, that it is discursive, collaborative, pluralistic, have been under such sustained attack that any act of defending it can be portrayed as its opposite.\n\nAnd yet, inconveniently, no deal must be resisted, as it will cause, at the very least, hardship and hunger. Democracy must be protected, as the alternative is, at best, even for the most insulated, nihilism. Freedom of movement and the rights of EU citizens have to be fought for just for the simple expedient of being able to look your friends and neighbours in the face.\n\nThe fundamental question of protest is not, \u201cWhat does it achieve?\u201d, as if there should be key performance indicators. Rather, \u201cWho are you if you do nothing? What solidarity are you not showing? What presumption of citizenly inertia are you building in to the metric?\u201d The calendar of events for this week, across the country, is at stopthecoup.org.uk. Coup has no \u201ce\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Though the Tory leader will try to exploit the Stop the Coup demonstrations our democracy must be defended, says Guardian columnist Zoe Williams", "authors": ["Zoe Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e4ade125bfd4149c1f0c20ef7b599dd51bd80a1/0_196_3441_2065/master/3441.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a537f14fb6193486afc52516bda17d9d"}
