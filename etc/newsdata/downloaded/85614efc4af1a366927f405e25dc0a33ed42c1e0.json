Today the company emailed members in the regions to warn that around 1,600 phone booths installed at WeWork locations have been found to have elevated levels of formaldehyde \u2014 which it warns could cause health issues for people exposed to the gas.\n\nWeWork blames the issue on a manufacturer of the booths.\n\nThe booths are provided in its co-working spaces for WeWork members to be able to take calls in private \u2014 given other common areas are shared by all users.\n\n\u201cAfter a member informed us of odor and eye irritation, WeWork performed an analysis, including having an outside consultant conduct a series of tests on a sampling of phone booths. Upon receiving results late last week, we began to take all potentially impacted phone booths out of service,\u201d it writes in an email to members.\n\nAffected phone booths \u201care being taken out of service immediately, and will be removed from your location as soon as possible,\u201d it adds.\n\nIn addition to ~1,600 booths it has confirmed are affected, a further 700 booths are being taken out of service in what WeWork describes as \u201can abundance of caution\u201d \u2014 i.e. while it carries out more checks \u2014 with the promise of a further update once it has concluded its tests.\n\nMembers wanting to know which booths are safe to use in the meanwhile are told to contact the community team at their WeWork location.\n\nWeWork also says alternative quiet spaces will be provided, such as in conference rooms and unused offices.\n\nDiscussing the health risks of formaldehyde gas \u2014 a chemical which is used in various building materials \u2013WeWork\u2019s email warns: \u201cShort-term exposure to formaldehyde at elevated levels may cause acute temporary irritation of the nose, throat, and respiratory system, including coughing or wheezing. These effects are typically transient and usually subside after removal of the formaldehyde source.\n\n\u201cLong-term exposure to formaldehyde, such as that experienced by workers in jobs who experience high concentrations over many years, has been associated with certain types of cancers. You can find additional information in this FAQ from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\u201d\n\nThe email encourages any WeWork members with health concerns to contact a doctor.\n\nA tipster who sent us the email reported experiencing a sensation of \u201cburning eyes\u201d after using the booths.\n\nThey also said several people in their team had experienced the same issue.\n\n\u201cSome complained that they felt nauseous after spending time inside the booths,\u201d the tipster wrote. \u201cI never felt that, but the burning eyes was 100% there for me several times. Scary stuff.\u201d\n\nReached for comment, a WeWork spokesperson confirmed the formaldehyde issue, saying it\u2019s taking \u201ca number\u201d of booths out of service at \u201csome\u201d locations in the U.S. and Canada \u2014 due to \u201cpotentially elevated levels of formaldehyde caused by the manufacturer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe safety and well-being of our members is our top priority, and we are working to remedy this situation as quickly as possible,\u201d it adds in a statement.\n\nIt is not clear exactly how many WeWork locations contain affected booths at this point.\n\nNor has WeWork provided more detailed information about how long members might have been exposed to elevated levels of formaldehyde \u2014 with its email merely suggesting some of the booths have been in place for \u201cmonths.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe potentially impacted phone booths have been installed over the past few months, exact timing varies based on location,\u201d it writes.\n\nAlthough clearly the level of exposure will vary from person to person depending on their use of the booths.\n\nThe company did not respond to a question asking whether any of its international WeWork locations are affected by the issue.", "description": "WeWork, the co-working empire once valued at $47 billion before reality struck, plunging the business and its investors into crisis, has another problem to add to its growing pile \u2014 one which doesn\u2019t exactly reflect well on its core business of kitting out and maintaining modern working environments.
