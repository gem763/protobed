But no such escape route existed for those adapted to cold, oxygen-rich environments.\n\nPreviously experts were undecided about whether lack of oxygen, heat stress, high acidity or poisoning chemicals wiped out life in the oceans at the end of the Permian period.\n\n'This is the first time that we have made a mechanistic prediction about what caused the extinction that can be directly tested with the fossil record, which then allows us to make predictions about the causes of extinction in the future,' said Mr Penn.", "description": "Researchers from the University of Washington say lessons from the Great Dying have major implications for the fate of today's warming world.", "authors": ["Peter Lloyd For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/06/16/7097848-0-image-a-17_1544114353217.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-06"}
