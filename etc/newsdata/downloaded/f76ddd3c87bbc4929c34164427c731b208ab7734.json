In both the Amazon basin and the rainforests of Indonesia, the world-scorching inferno rages on, already forgotten by most of the media. Intricate living systems, species that took millions of years to evolve, are being incinerated in moments, then replaced with monocultures. Giant plumes of carbon tip us further into climate breakdown. And we\u2019re not even talking about it.\n\nWorld losing area of forest the size of the UK each year, report finds Read more\n\nBut underneath the grief and frustration, I also feel disquiet. We rightly call on other nations to protect their stunning places. But where are our rainforests? I mean this both metaphorically and literally. Out of 218 nations, the UK ranks 189th for the intactness of its living systems. Having trashed our own wildlife, our excessive demand for meat, animal feed, timber, minerals and fossil fuels helps lay waste the rest of the world.\n\nAmong our missing ecosystems are rainforests. Rainforests are not confined to the tropics: a good definition is forest wet enough to support epiphytes \u2013 plants that grow on other plants. Particularly in the west of Britain, where tiny fragments persist, you can find trees covered in rich growths of a fern called polypody, mosses and lichens, and flowering plants climbing the lower trunks. Learning that Britain is a rainforest nation astounds us only because we have so little left.\n\nWe now know that, alongside keeping fossil fuels in the ground, natural climate solutions \u2013 using the mass restoration of nature to draw down carbon from the air \u2013 offer perhaps the last remaining chance to prevent more than 1.5C, or even 2C, of global heating. Saving the remaining rainforests and other rich ecosystems, while restoring those we have lost, is not just a nice idea: our lives may depend on it. But in countries like the UK, we urge others to act while overlooking our own disasters.\n\nForeigners I meet are often flabbergasted by the state of our national parks. They see the sheepwrecked deserts and grousetrashed moors and ask: \u201cWhat are you protecting here?\u201d In the name of \u201ccultural heritage\u201d we allow harsh commercial interests, embedded in the modern economy but dependent on public money, to complete the kind of ecological cleansing we lament in the Amazon. Sheep farming has done for our rainforests what cattle ranching is doing to Brazil\u2019s. Then we glorify these monocultures \u2013 the scoured, treeless hills \u2013 as \u201cwild\u201d and \u201cunspoilt\u201d.\n\nThe conservation groups have manifestly failed to translate our love of nature into action\n\nWhen the International Union for Conservation of Nature sought to classify our national parks, it had to invent a new category. Most of the world\u2019s national parks are category I or II: set aside principally for nature. But all of ours are category V: places where, in practice, business comes first and nature last. Much of the land in our national parks is systematically burned. In the northern parks, this destruction is wreaked by grouse estates, and in Snowdonia by farmers. But on Dartmoor and Exmoor, the park authorities do it themselves, torching wildlife, roasting the soil, pouring carbon into the skies: everything we condemn elsewhere.\n\nThe government\u2019s new Landscapes Review is better than I expected, but its positive proposals are in no way commensurate with our ecological and climate crises. It suggests that England\u2019s national parks and other protected landscapes should \u201chave a renewed mission to recover and enhance nature \u2026 simply sustaining what we have is not nearly good enough\u201d. But it does not argue that any of our parks should aim for something better than category V. Nor does it recommend that burning should cease, or that farming should withdraw from some places to allow rainforests and other rich habitats to recover. Where is the ambition our emergencies demand?\n\nWe urgently need more trees, but we appear to believe that the only means of restoring them is planting. We have a national obsession with tree planting, which is in danger of becoming as tokenistic as bamboo toothbrushes and cotton tote bags. In many places rewilding, or natural regeneration \u2013 allowing trees to seed and spread themselves \u2013 is much faster and more effective, and tends to produce far richer habitats.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Burning gorse on Dartmoor. Photograph: Marc Hill/Alamy\n\nAll over the country, I see \u201cconservation woodlands\u201d that look nothing like ecological restoration and everything like commercial forestry: the ground blasted with glyphosate (a herbicide that kills everything), trees planted in straight rows, in plastic tree guards attached with cable ties to treated posts. It looks hideous, it takes decades to begin to resemble a natural forest and, in remote parts of the nation, it is often the primary cause of plastic litter, much of which is never recovered. There are no woodland creation grants in this country supporting natural regeneration: public money is pegged exclusively to the number of trees planted. This is one of the reasons for the shocking failure to meet the UK\u2019s targets for new woodlands.\n\nThe government should follow the hierarchical approach suggested by the conservationist Steve Jones. It should fund natural regeneration wherever possible. Where trees struggle to establish themselves, it should finance assisted regeneration (clearing competing vegetation). Only where those options won\u2019t work should it offer grants for tree planting. But while nature loves a mess, officialdom abhors one: instead of natural exuberance it seeks neat industrial rows.\n\nDon\u2019t expect much help from politicians. Michael Gove\u2019s successor as environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, seems tongue-tied, apparently terrified of offending vested interests. Labour\u2019s vote for a Green New Deal, with a 2030 deadline for decarbonisation (20 years before the government\u2019s) is exciting. But we now need to see its commitments on industrial emissions matched by ambitious proposals for ecological restoration.\n\nGrow your own forest: how to plant trees to help save the planet Read more\n\nNor are the big conservation groups filling the void. Ours is an extraordinary situation: a nation of nature lovers, obsessed by wildlife programmes, represented by gigantic NGOs, but apparently incapable of preventing the precipitous decline of wildlife and habitats. The conservation groups have manifestly failed to translate our love of nature into action.\n\nThey betray their radical roots. The National Trust arose from the Commons Preservation Society, that tore down fences to return land to the people. Now it allows the forces it once contested to ride roughshod over its land, allowing trail hunts and exclusive grouse shoots to erode the sense of national ownership. On its Exmoor estate, in the resource book it publishes for school teachers, it celebrates burning the land. The RSPB was founded by women seeking to ban the import of birds\u2019 plumage for hats \u2013 they eventually succeeded. Now, as independent ecologists raise massive petitions to ban driven grouse shooting, the RSPB undermines their campaigns by calling for this devastating practice to be, er, licensed. Hesitation and appeasement reign.\n\nWe should continue to mobilise against the destruction of the world\u2019s great habitats, and its terrifying implications. But the most persuasive argument we can make is to show we mean it, by restoring our own lost wonders.\n\n\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist", "description": "It will take vision and a willingness to confront vested interests, but we can restore our trashed ecosystems, says Guardian columnist George Monbiot", "authors": ["George Monbiot"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afba243120383ada881c7f9ca14add783702264b/0_236_5297_3179/master/5297.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b7d8f9d733490d0db8107d2b043edcd7", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
