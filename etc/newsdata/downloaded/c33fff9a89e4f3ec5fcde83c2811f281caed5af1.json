Despite lacking much legal merit, their complaints have carried a political bite, most notably during last week\u2019s GOP-led takeover of the secure room in the Capitol basement where impeachment depositions are being held.\n\nRead: House Republicans Threw a Pizza-Fueled Tantrum to Distract from the Damning Testimony Against Trump\n\nThe last two congressional impeachment investigations have held a vote, had open hearings and gave the minority the same investigative rights as the majority. Democrats are now doing two of those three things, though they have yet to commit to give Republicans subpoena power once they\u2019re through the initial phase of the investigation. None of those things are constitutionally required, however.\n\nThe decision to hold a vote also signals that Democrats are moving full-steam ahead in their impeachment investigations. More witnesses are scheduled to testify to the impeachment inquiry this week as the House looks into allegations that President Trump sought to pressure Ukraine into publicly investigating his political opponents by withholding military aid.\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the measure on Thursday. Its exact language hasn\u2019t been released yet, but Pelosi\u2019s letter said it will establish procedures for future open hearings (to date they've been behind closed doors), authorize the disclosure of deposition transcripts from the committees\u2019 previous interviews, and outline how the evidence will be given to the House Judiciary Committee, the committee responsible for introducing the actual articles of impeachment. Pelosi also says the vote will set forth \u201cdue process rights\u201d for Trump, though it\u2019s unclear what exactly that will entail.\n\nCover: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks at the 2019 Democratic women's leadership forum, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, in Washington.
