The decision to shift capital into healthcare assets is driven by the returns available in the growing property class and is part of the fund's broader allocation to real estate.\n\nAround 30 per cent of HESTA's overall portfolio is tied up in unlisted assets, with a little under one third of that allocation going into property.\n\nThe new mandate with ISPT is the first sector-specific allocation HESTA has placed, according to Andrew Major, its general manager for unlisted assets.", "description": "The super fund manages $51 billion and has given a $200 million mandate to ISPT to set up the HESTA Healthcare Property Trust which will invest in hospitals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5838f7c180f20ff3bee6cf41b48a5ed0eaf4c45a", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
