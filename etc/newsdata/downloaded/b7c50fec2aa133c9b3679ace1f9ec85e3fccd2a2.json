We got a young team they are pumped up about moving on.\u201d\n\nNew York starts the AL Championship Series on Saturday, at home against the Tampa Bay Rays or at the Houston Astros.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Tampa Bay\u2019s Kevin Kiermaier smashed a three-run homer to help power the Rays over Houston 10-3 to sustain their title hopes.\n\nThe host Rays pulled within 2-1 in the series and will host game four on Tuesday, when Houston\u2019s Justin Verlander will pitch on short rest to seek a series-winning victory.\n\nHouston\u2019s Jose Altuve opened the scoring on Monday with a first-inning solo homer but Kiermaier\u2019s blast in the second inning put the Rays ahead to stay.\n\n\u201cRunning around the bases not feeling my feet hit the ground was a great feeling,\u201d Kiermaier said.\n\nTampa Bay pitcher Charlie Morton, a 35-year-old American right-hander who played with Houston the past two seasons, struck out nine batters while issuing only three hits and two walks over five innings.\n\nMorton improved to 4-0 in career playoff elimination games.\n\n\u201cNothing ever bothers him. He\u2019s so composed,\u201d Kiermaier said.\n\nIn St. Louis, catcher Yadier Molina drove in the tying and winning runs to rally the Cardinals past Atlanta 5-4 in 10 innings and force a one-game showdown to advance in the playoffs.\n\nThe Cardinals pulled level at 2-2 in the series with the final game on Wednesday in Atlanta, the winner advancing to the National League Championship Series.\n\nSt. Louis second baseman Kolten Wong doubled down the left-field line off Atlanta reliever Julio Teheran in the 10th and Marcell Ozuna, who hit two home runs, reached on a fielder\u2019s choice that moved Wong to third.\n\nMolina, who had singled in the tying run in the eighth inning, then blasted a sacrifice fly to left field, sending Wong to home plate for the winning run.\n\n\u201cI was ready to hit the fastball and he gave it to me right down the middle,\u201d said Molina, in his 93rd career playoff start. \u201cWe put some good at-bats together in the last inning and we got the win.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Scherzer shines \u2013\n\nElsewhere, Max Scherzer pitched seven quality innings on a short rest and the Washington Nationals routed the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-1 to even their series 2-2.\n\nThe 35-year-old Scherzer allowed just one run on four hits and struck out seven for the Nationals, who forced a decisive game five Wednesday in southern California.\n\nRyan Zimmerman hit a three-run homer and Anthony Rendon drove in three runs. Right hander Scherzer threw 72 of his total 109 pitchers for strikes and walked three.\n\nDodgers relief pitcher Julio Urias took the loss, giving up three runs on three hits and getting just two outs.\n\nLeft hander Rich Hill started the game for Los Angeles and was followed by five relievers including Urias. Hill lasted just 2 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Dodgers loaded the bases in the seventh, but their rally was snuffed out when Joc Pederson grounded out to second base to end the inning.\n\nThe Dodgers are trying to book a third straight trip to the NL Championship series.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Gleyber Torres clubbed a second inning home run and made a couple of clutch defensive plays as the New York Yankees punched their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/23cd5b_new-york-rising-star-gleyber-torres-celebrates-scoring-as-yankees-dominated-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
