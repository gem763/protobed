I\u2019m a bad motherf*****.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m jumping up weight, I should be getting that belt.\n\n\u2018The UFC belt is the belt you want. No disrespect to Masvidal or Nate and you do have to consider the fact they are bad motherf******, but so am I and so is Gastelum.\u2019\n\nWhile Till doesn\u2019t have much time for the BMF title, he does think freshly crowned middleweight champion Israel Adesanya is fully deserving of his belt.\n\nAdesanya became champion earlier this month thanks to a stunning performance against Robert Whittaker in Australia and Till was blown away by the New Zealander\u2019s display.\n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s the whole package,\u2019 Till said.\n\nThe UFC decided to create a belt for Diaz vs Masvidal (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Me and him are very alike. He\u2019s got swag, style and he knows how to talk. He\u2019s very intelligent, he can fight and he\u2019s cool.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s not to like? The only people hating on him are jealous, bitter people.\u2019\n\n\u2018I thought he could lose that fight and he just beat Rob up,\u2019 Till continued. \u2018I don\u2019t see where any hatred could come from.\n\nTill thinks Adesanya is a worthy middleweight champion (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Rob Whittaker fought Yoel Romero twice and beat him twice. Maybe the second one he didn\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Still, Israel comes in and beats him like that, shows what a fighter he is.
