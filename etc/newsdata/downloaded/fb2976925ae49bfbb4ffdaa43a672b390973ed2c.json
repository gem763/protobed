They have started a process to sell The Ritz hotel and are considering selling the Telegraph Media Group, according to people familiar with their plans, in part to address differing priorities of family members.\n\nThe owner of the Daily Mail recently contacted the Barclay family about a potential acquisition of the Telegraph, but the approach was rebuffed, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nA takeover by the Daily Mail and General Trust, which is owned by Viscount Rothermere, would create a stable of Conservative-leaning titles spanning the Mail, the Telegraph, and Metro with a combined circulation in the UK approaching that of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp papers.\n\nSuch market power would strengthen the DMGT\u2019s ability to set a common strategy for its newspapers as print sales and advertising revenues steadily decline. But it is likely to run up against a host of regulatory and commercial hurdles, including the price expectations of the Barclay brothers.", "description": "The billionaire Barclay brothers, who own The Ritz hotel in London and Britain\u2019s Telegraph newspaper, are close to pumping half a billion pounds into their ailing empire even as they review the assets for possible sale.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9099%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_535/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0470338ccd0f0266376024e5ab71e93069cbb987", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
