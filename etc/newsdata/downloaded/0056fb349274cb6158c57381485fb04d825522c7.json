He led police on a chase after a traffic stop, which ended in the yard of a day care center\n\nAfter taking just eight steps in the yard, Sgt Ray Villalvazo (pictured behind the fence on the lef) drew his gun and opened fire\n\nPolice officers were on the verge of taking Murrietta-Golding into custody when he took off running.\n\nThe officers pursued the teenage suspect on foot and ordered him to stop, as seen in the newly released video obtained by KFSN.\n\nIn the footage, Murrietta-Golding is seen jumping over a fence surrounding a day care facility.\n\nAt that moment, Sgt Ray Villalvazo - one of the two officers chasing the teen - draws his gun and fires a single shot through the fence, which causes Marietta-Golding to crumple to the ground after taking just eight steps.\n\nVillalvazo's partner can be heard telling him in the background, 'Good shot.'\n\nAn investigation conducted by the City of Fresno's Office of independent Review later found that during the chase, the officers saw Murrietta-Golding repeatedly reach for his waistband while looking at them over his shoulder.\n\nAccording to the investigation, Villalvazo opened fire believing that Murrietta-Golding was reaching for a gun.\n\nThe teen collapsed to the ground suffering from a gunshot wound to the back of the head\n\nin the video, one of the officers tells the cop who opened ire, 'Good shot'\n\nAn investigation conducted by the Office of independent Review sided with police\n\nThe 16-year-old was shot once in the back of the head. No weapon was found in his possession.\n\nThe OIR sided with the officer, concluding that his use of lethal force in this case was consistent with the department's policy.\n\n'The reasonableness of force is based on the officer making a split second decision after observing the suspect reaching for his waistband area several times during the foot pursuit,' wrote independent reviewer John Gliatta.\n\nSeparate investigations by the Fresno Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau and the Fresno County District Attorney\u2019s Office have reached the same conclusion.\n\nMurrietta-Golding (left) was a suspect in the murder of 19-year-old Eugenio Ybarra (right) a day earlier\n\nYbarra died when his car crashed into a tree after two men fired shots at his car\n\nIsiah's uncle is showing his photo on his cellphone while standing next to the teen's grandfather during an interview\n\nMurrietta-Golding's father has filed a civil lawsuit against Sgt Villalvazo and the Fresno Police Department, alleging excessive force and wrongful death.\n\nPlaintiff's attorney Stuart Chandler challenged the OIR's findings, arguing that the law says there has to be an immediate threat of death or serious injury to justify a police officer's use of deadly force.\n\n'This young man was trying to run away,' he told KFSN. 'And you can be as critical as you want about how you shouldn't do that, but it doesn't give police the right to use lethal force.'\n\nFresno Police Department Chief Andrew Hall defended his officers' actions, saying in a statement that Murrietta-Golding and his 17--year-old brother were suspects in the killing of 19-year-old Eugenio Ybarra, who crashed into a tree after two men fired shots through his car window a day earlier.\n\nMurrietta-Golding's brother later pleaded guilty in that case.\n\n'The video represents a different vantage point and was not what the pursuing officers could see,' Hall argued. 'The 16-year-old was also known to carry firearms and had jumped a fence into a child daycare center.'\n\nThe father's lawsuit notes that the day care was closed at the time of the shooting, and that police did not have warrants for the arrest of Murrietta-Golding and his brother at the time of the traffic stop.\n\nThe wrongful death lawsuit is set to go to trial in October 2020.", "description": "Surveillance video released as part of a wrongful death lawsuit shows a Fresno, California, police officer shoot and kill Isiah Murrietta-Golding during a foot chase in 2017.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/14/20133020-0-image-a-34_1571924116446.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
