China\u2019s GDP forecast was cut by a tenth in 2019 to 6.1% and by 0.3 points in 2020 to 5.7%.\n\n\u201cEscalating trade policy tensions are taking an increasing toll on confidence and investment, adding to policy uncertainty, weighing on risk sentiment in financial markets, and endangering future growth prospects,\u201d the OECD said.\n\nThe OECD said the impact of 2019 U.S-China trade tensions would be to reduce Chinese GDP by a full percentage point, U.S. GDP by 0.7 points and world GDP by 0.6 points. A no-deal Brexit could cut U.K. GDP by nearly 3 percentage points in 2022, and eurozone GDP by 0.6 points.\n\nInvestors are holding massive amounts of risky debt, the OECD said, pointing to leveraged corporate loans in particular. Another concern is the long-term decline in trend growth could persist.\n\nThe OECD said governments are in a position to reverse the spiraling costs of uncertainty and invest more, and meeting infrastructure investment could help limit the risks to growth.", "description": "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Thursday downgraded its assessment of the global economy to the worst growth rate since the...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR533_mnuchi_ZG_20190918111449.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
