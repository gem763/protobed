A rundown Melbourne house featured in Beyonc\u00e9's No Angel video clip has undergone a dramatic transformation after a buyer bought the property in an 'unlivable condition'\n\nThe auction had a large audience in 2016, as hundreds of hipsters, locals and prospective buyers came to witness the home go to the highest bidder.\n\nNelson Alexander\u2019s real estate agent Luke Sacco, who sold the home at the time, told Domain: 'It was pretty rough. It needed a complete renovation.'\n\nHe also added about the property: ' It was a weatherboard house and it hadn\u2019t been touched in forever. It was unlivable, [the new owner] had to do something with it.'\n\n'The house has received a facelift and extension': The property's new owners have so far painted over the green exterior, removed the chimney and added a separate level - and the construction is still ongoing\n\nModest! The two-bedroom home (right) was listed for sale for between $470,000 and $510,000\n\nNeeding a bit of love: It was unlikely any divas would have wanted to purchase the two-bedroom weatherboard home with peeling paint and tin roof at the time\n\nThe previous owner, elderly Jeanette Meadows, was paid $300 to use her house as a backdrop for American singer Beyonce's music video.\n\nJeanette and husband Roy Meadows, who sat peacefully in the crowd on deckchairs as the auction took place, had no idea who Queen Bey was when she came knocking in October 2013.\n\nThere was a lot of speculation from fans as to what the pop diva was actually doing at the site, and it was originally thought she was shooting promotional images for her Australian Mrs Carter tour.\n\nBut it was later revealed she was dressed in the white leotard and fur coat at the turquoise home to film the clip as part of her secretly produced self-titled album, released December that year without any promotion.\n\nAn irreplaceable piece of music history! The set of Beyonc\u00e9's No Angel film clip, a not-so flawless Melbourne cottage, was sold for a whopping $650,000 (pictured Beyonc\u00e9 impersonator Nalva Hewitt and vendor Jeanette Meadows)\n\nThe opportunity to boost its sale price wasn't lost on the Nelson Alexander realtors either, who boasted the \u2018charming\u2019 home was \u2018most notably the scene of pop megastar Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2013 No Angel clip\u2019.\n\nMs Meadows had lived there with her husband Roy for more than 50 years, according to Herald Sun.\n\nThen 80, she told media at the time she wasn\u2019t \u2018not keen on her at all\u2019, and appeared confused by the attention.\n\nIt needed work! Although the two-bedroom home in the trendy Melbourne area was sold to a modest price, the buyer was aware they would need to fork out much more on renovating the decrepit home\n\nBright and breezy: The Edwardian home on Beith Street has a sunny courtyard and is perched on 140m2\n\nSocial media buzz: When Queen Bee was spotted at the Brunswick home in October 2013, it was originally thought she was shooting promotional images for her Australian Mrs Carter tour, but it was later revealed to be for the secret No Angel clip\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t know who it was, I thought it was somebody\u2019s fianc\u00e9,\u2019 The Daily Edition reported her saying.\n\n\u2018But that\u2019s how you pronounce her name. What is she, French or something or what?\u2019\n\nFans soon flocked to the location to recreate their own photo shoots outside the home after an image of Beyonc\u00e9 spread on social media in October 2013.\n\nIt was all revealed: It was later revealed she was dressed in the white leotard and fur coat at the turquoise home to film the clip for her secretly produced self-titled album, released December that year without any promotion", "description": "A rundown Melbourne cottage the was featured in\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9's No Angel film clip has undergone a dramatic transformation since being purchased for $650,000 at auction in 2016.", "authors": ["Candice Jackson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/07/20022012-0-image-a-11_1571724825406.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
