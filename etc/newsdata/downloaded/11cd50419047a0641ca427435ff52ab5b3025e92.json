She said she believed the march should not have gone ahead because of the heat and concluded that the safety assessment carried out was not fit for purpose.\n\nHunt added: \u201cIt leaves me very worried about the army\u2019s ability to learn from previous mistakes. It\u2019s a matter of grave concern. I want to give a message to the army that they need to think about how to learn. Quite simply, something has to change.\u201d\n\nHunt\u2019s comments were echoed by Hoole\u2019s father, Phillip Hoole, who said the Ministry of Defence had failed to make meaningful changes since the SAS tragedy and accused it of \u201csystemic organisational failure\u201d. He said he intended to launch a civil action against the MoD for corporate manslaughter and called for the police to investigate.\n\n\u201cMany promises were made and undertakings given to implement change,\u201d Hoole said. \u201cIt is my belief that the MoD failed in its duty of care to implement any meaningful changes.\u201d\n\nHe was particularly angry at a report on his son\u2019s death carried out by the Defence Safety Authority that he said had sought to rule out a link between Hoole\u2019s death and heat. He claimed the report contained lies and inaccuracies.\n\nBryher Dunsby, whose husband James was one of the three who died in the SAS test, said she believed there had been an attempt to cover up what happened to Hoole.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe MoD are willing to defend themselves at all costs, regardless of truth or justice for the individual who has died and their families.\u201d\n\nDunsby said she knew that special forces had updated and modernised their training and attitude to heat. \u201cHowever, this clearly has not been transferred to the rest of the British army. This needs to happen as a priority: more of our service personnel will die in training if it is not addressed.\u201d\n\nGiving a narrative conclusion, Hunt highlighted that of the 41 corporals and lance corporals taking part in the AFT only 24 completed it, with many complaining of the heat being magnified because it was held in by the hedges lining the lanes in which they were moving with full pack and rifle. One said it felt hotter than Afghanistan.\n\nThe coroner said another soldier, who collapsed before Hoole died, should have been recognised as a casualty of the heat \u2013 which ought to have led to the AFT being halted. In fact, those in charge of the AFT thought he had an ankle injury. The soldier was told later in hospital he could have died if he had not stopped.\n\nOfficer in fatal march says he lacked health and safety training Read more\n\nHunt oversaw the SAS inquest in 2015 and issued a report intended to prevent further deaths, specifically raising concerns about issues such as the lack of awareness about heat and risk assessments.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe failure of the army to learn from previous mistakes is a very concerning matter for me.\u201d She said she would write another report on preventing further deaths to the defence secretary.\n\nThe coroner said the AFT should not have gone ahead at all because when the trial began at about 7am the temperature would have been above 20C \u2013 the point at which such exercises should not take place.\n\nHunt concluded that \u201cheat stress\u201d was one of a number of factors that led to Hoole\u2019s death, although she said it was not the sole factor and he also had an underlying heart condition.\n\nBrig Christopher Coles expressed regret but did not offer an apology to Hoole\u2019s family. He said: \u201cThe MoD has acknowledged that aspects of the policy in place which governed the training Cpl Hoole was undertaking could have been better and was in areas inconsistent. While much work has already been done to address this, we will seek to ensure it is refined and improved to help ensure a tragedy like Cpl Hoole\u2019s death is not repeated.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Very serious failings\u2019 were made in death of Cpl Joshua Hoole in Brecon Beacons", "authors": ["Steven Morris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb42d349845c992275eaba6702957bb1a8a8593/0_176_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=da6ad5d8a4b297a11b4ce76da0093813", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
