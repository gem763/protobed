'He was the better player in the second and third sets. I started well in the first set, but I wasn't sharp enough.'\n\nNovak Djokivic has failed to reach the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters for the first time\n\nUntil Friday's match, Djokovic had won 24 straight sets in Asia, a run that included last year's Shanghai Masters and the title in Tokyo last week.\n\nTsitsipas has now beaten Djokovic twice in three matches. The 21-year-old Greek defeated Djokovic in their first meeting at the 2018 Toronto tournament and Djokovic won their match in Madrid this season.\n\nTsitsipas also earned a place at the year-end ATP Finals for the first time on Friday. But that was guaranteed when third-seeded Daniil Medvedev beat Fabio Fognini 6-3, 7-6 (4) in another quarter-final match.\n\nMedvedev, who will face Tsitsipas in Saturday's semi-finals, is one match away from reaching a sixth consecutive tournament final. He reached his first Grand Slam final at the U.S. Open, and then won titles in Cincinnati and St. Petersburg.\n\nThe 21-year-old celebrates after defeating Djokovic at Qizhong Forest Sports City\n\nMedvedev leads the tour with 57 match wins this season and is 40-1 on hard courts when winning the first set. The only time he lost a hard-court match after winning the first set was against Gael Monfils in Rotterdam.\n\nPrior to Friday's match, Fognini said Medvedev was one of the most dangerous players to face.\n\n'If some top players like Fabio can say this about me, shows that I'm on the good way, I'm playing good, and it's not easy to play against me,' Medvedev said. 'Surely, yeah, that's what I tried to show today on the match and it worked out.'", "description": "Novak Djokovic's semi-final streak in Shanghai is over.
