After a tumultuous two years since its IPO in 2017, it seems the investor community has begun to like what Snap is doing to turn its business around.\n\nSnap stock has climbed 154% this year and 193% from the December low, making it the best performer in the Index. The shares closed Friday up 1.5% at $14.52.\n\nSnap price chart\n\nThe operator of photo-sharing app Snapchat is gaining traction after a disastrous 2018 when the number of users shrank, several top executives left and teenagers didn\u2019t like the redesign of its app.\n\nHowever, according to Nomura Instinet, one of the most bullish research houses on Snap stock, new users on this social-messaging app could now double the company\u2019s own forecast.\n\nDownloads for Snapchat continued to show strong growth in August, rising 21% from a year ago, according to a monthly data tracker by Nomura. At this rate, analyst Mark Kelley estimated in a recent note, Snap will add between 5.5 and 10 million users this quarter, well above the range of 2-4 million projected by the company.\n\nEarlier, Stifel upgraded Snap to buy from hold and hiked its price target to $17 from $13, with its analyst John Egbert saying that he is increasingly optimistic about Snap\u2019s growth prospects in the second-half of 2019 and beyond.\n\nMorgan Stanley, in a note last week, upgraded Snap to \u201cequal weight,\u201d from \u201cunderweight,\u201d citing faster ad revenue growth and improved discipline in managing operating expenses. Said MS:\n\n\u201cAt a high level, year-to-date we have underestimated Snap\u2019s stronger top and bottom-line execution and ability to drive growth and upward revisions.\"\n\nSnap\u2019s games platform and new augmented reality features which enables users to add graphics to their hands, feet or bodies are among the features that have been very popular in recent months, in addition to the app\u2019s face-distorting lenses, and a gender-swap lens that turns a male face into a female one, and vice versa.\n\nInstagram Threat\n\nSnap\u2019s improving and user metrics have no doubt played a big role in its stock\u2019s outperformance this year, but the regulatory oversight that the large social media companies are facing is another big positive for the company.\n\nAn app with a clear and defined audience and with little room for misuse is in a much better position to withstand potential regulatory changes globally than behemoths like Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet\u2019s Google (NASDAQ: ) \u2014 the social media heavyweights coming under increasingly intense scrutiny.\n\nBut despite shifting expectations from analysts, Facebook-owned Instagram continues to pose a great competitive threat to Snap and its future growth. The shares plunged 7.6% on Oct. 3 after Instagram rolled out a new mobile application called \u201cThreads,\u201d that will allow users to stay in close contact with a small circle of people.\n\nThat\u2019s very similar to the domain which Snap is trying to monetize after creating close communities among friends. In 2016, Instagram copied Snapchat\u2019s popular \u201cstories\u201d product for posting photo and video updates that disappear.\n\nAnd despite this year's strong comeback, investors shouldn\u2019t forget that Snap stock still trades more than 40% down from the level it touched soon after its IPO in 2017. Those who bet on Snap stock at the time are just recovering their losses, besides having missed out on other money-making opportunities.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSnap, in our view, remains a highly volatile stock and isn't suitable for long-term investors because of its uneven user-engagement record, escalating costs, and a higher turnover among its top executives. Instagram, owned by much bigger rival Facebook, continues to pose an existential threat to Snap that's unlikely to go away. Due to these uncertainties, we don\u2019t recommend risk-averse investors buy this stock.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: Alphabet Inc Class A, NASDAQ Internet, Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc Class C.
