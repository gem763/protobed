Judge Robert Katzmann, who is overseeing the panel, hinted as much during the one-hour proceeding, noting that \u201cthis case seems bound for the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nIn a letter filed with the court on Monday and issued into the record Wednesday, both sides agreed that the losing side will petition the U.S. Supreme Court within 10 days of a decision by the appeals court panel. As part of the agreement, Vance has promised not to enforce the subpoena until after the high court either declines to take up the case or hears it and issues an opinion.\n\nVance\u2019s subpoena for Trump\u2019s tax filing is one of four making their way through courts. The other three were issued by various congressional committees seeking the returns from Mazars, two banks that lent money to Trump, and the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe Manhattan DA\u2019s subpoena was obtained in late August as part of a grand jury proceeding. Prosecutors also have lined up a number of witnesses, including Cohen, who is serving a three-year prison sentence for crimes that include his role in facilitating the hush-money payments, the person with knowledge of the investigation said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who else prosecutors have spoken with, but others with knowledge of payments have talked with prosecutors, the person said, declining to give names.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if Cohen has testified before the grand jury. The challenge prosecutors face is that a convicted criminal is not an ideal witness\u2014making other evidence, such as the tax returns, all the more crucial.\n\nCohen told federal prosecutors in court that the payouts were made \u201cat the direction\u201d of then-candidate Trump and both the president and the Trump Organization funneled the hush money through him.\n\nCohen has been helpful to Vance\u2019s prosecutors during multiple interviews at the Manhattan DA\u2019s office and the upstate New York prison where he is serving time, the person said. What that Manhattan DA\u2019s office has learned \u201cdovetails\u201d with information Cohen gave to federal prosecutors, the person said.", "description": "Prosecutors \u201cassume what they are looking for is in there,\u201d one source said.", "authors": ["Pervaiz Shallwani", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1913,w_3401,x_311,y_338/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571945241/RTS2SHVB_vt0jkt", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
