Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to take part.\n\nWithout significant progress, Trump is set to hike the tariff rate on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% next Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said: \u201cIf we can make a deal, we\u2019re going to make a deal, there\u2019s a really good chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my opinion China wants to make a deal more than I do,\u201d Trump added.\n\nBased on the current situation, there is a possibility that this week\u2019s talks between the world\u2019s two largest economies could end in a deadlock, according to a Chinese official briefed on preparations for the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity. Asked about the probability of reaching an agreement, the official said, \u201cThis is not an easy task. It requires a lot of preparation work and consensus on both sides.\u201d\n\nFor trade relations or overall ties between the two countries to improve, more time is needed, Chinese officials said.\n\nWhile previous lower-level talks between U.S. and Chinese officials aimed to create a good atmosphere for the upcoming meeting, the U.S. blacklisting of 28 Chinese companies has generated a negative atmosphere instead, Chinese officials said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce on Monday blacklisted video surveillance firm Hikvision and 27 others, days ahead of the talks. The Commerce Department barred the technology and artificial intelligence companies from doing business with U.S. firms, citing human rights violations of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang. Chinese officials said the action interfered with China\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nBoth sides should not escalate disputes or they will drift apart, said a second Beijing-based Chinese official briefed on the talks this week.\n\nThe trade talks come in the wake of tit-for-tat bans on certain visas for each other\u2019s officials and a controversy sparked by a Twitter post by an executive with the National Basketball Association\u2019s Houston Rockets supporting anti-government protests in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWe can add the Diplomatic war to the Financial war, Currency war and Technology war, that we already have,\u201d John Browning, managing director at brokerage BANDS Financial in Shanghai, said in a note to investors.\n\nWhile there is a huge contingent of high-level Chinese officials traveling to Washington, \u201cto my jaded perception it looks less than a delegation rather a funeral cortege,\u201d Browning wrote.\n\nThe U.S. demand that the Chinese Communist Party fundamentally change how it directs China\u2019s massive economy to shift to a more Western model of free-market capitalism is irrational and misguided, a Chinese diplomat in the United States said.\n\n\u201cWhat we achieved during the past few decades shows that our system is good for development in China,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nChina would not ask the United States to shift to an economy that relies heavily on state-owned enterprises, or ask it to start fully funding education, as China\u2019s does, he said, so why should Washington expect the same from Beijing?\n\n\u201cWe hope to strike an agreement but also accept the differences,\u201d the diplomat added.\n\nWestern governments\u2019 treatment of China in the past, including welcoming the country into multilateral organizations such as the World Trade Organization, has been predicated on the assumption that this ultimately would lead to Beijing\u2019s liberalization and gradual embrace of democratic norms.\n\nWashington is expected to press new demands for Beijing to protect U.S. intellectual property this week, but both sides have very different views of that topic as well.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Flags of U.S. and China are displayed at American International Chamber of Commerce (AICC)'s booth during China International Fair for Trade in Services in Beijing, China, May 28, 2019. REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nChinese officials contend that China did not steal intellectual property in the past, saying Western companies gave it up willingly and reaped the benefits.\n\n\u201cMany decisions were made based on entrepreneurial partnerships,\u201d the U.S.-based Chinese official said, adding that they have mostly benefited Western companies.\n\nFor example, for every $1,000 iPhone, China\u2019s share of production is just $70, the official said.", "description": "Surprised and upset by the U.S. blacklisting of Chinese companies, China has lowered expectations for significant progress from this week's trade talks with the United States, Chinese government officials told Reuters, even as President Donald Trump on Wednesday expressed fresh optimism.", "authors": ["Jing Xu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439080592&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981WI", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
