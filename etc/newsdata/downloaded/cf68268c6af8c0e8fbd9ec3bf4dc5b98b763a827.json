Dailynews/ via REUTERS\n\nPhotos on Wednesday showed Thai mourners and zoo staff laying flowers near the empty enclosure of Chuang Chuang at age 19 at the Chiang Mai Zoo.\n\n\u201cWe loved and nurtured him so much. I hope everyone will miss him like we do,\u201d zoo keeper Kannikar Chantarangsi told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe cause of death has not been released. Pandas generally live 14-20 years in the wild but can live up to 30 years in captivity, according to the WWF animal welfare organisation.\n\n\u201cThe Chiang Mai Zoo will wait for experts from China to arrive. All the relevant Chinese agencies have been informed and we will conduct the autopsy together,\u201d Wuttichai Muangmun, director of Chiang Mai Zoo told reporters.\n\nA zoo official told Reuters the Chinese experts would arrive on Thursday. A statement from China\u2019s consulate in Chiang Mai from Monday said experts from the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda had been dispatched.\n\nThe death has caused a stir in Chuang Chuang\u2019s native China, where a hashtag about the death drew 250 million views on social media site Weibo and some Chinese users blamed the Thai zoo.\n\n\u201cNo more pandas for Thailand,\u201d wrote one Weibo comment.\n\nChuang Chuang and his partner Lin Hui - now Thailand\u2019s only remaining panda - were celebrities in Thailand after Lin Hui gave birth in 2009. Baby pandas are rarely born in captivity and the animal was eventually returned to China.\n\nLin Hui conceived through artificial insemination after Chuang Chuang failed to impregnate her, despite being shown videos dubbed \u201cpanda porn\u201d meant to encourage them to mate.\n\nPandas are famously difficult to breed in captivity.\n\nThe pair have been on loan to Thailand since 2003.\n\nThey were \u201cmarried\u201d in November 2005 at a traditional Chinese wedding ceremony overseen by a Chinese diplomat to mark the zoo\u2019s 28th birthday.", "description": "Animal experts from China are to arrive at a Thai zoo on Thursday to investigate the unexpected death of a giant panda in the northern city of Chiang Mai, Thai officials said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431204172&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0SR", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
