The prices were so expensive too!\n\n(Image: Sarah Lindsey)\n\n\"It's so important to do things yourself, and to have something homemade.\n\n\"All you need really is a staple gun and some rugs to get going. I must have saved about \u00a31,000.\"\n\nSarah split the work over several days as she repainted the stairs using a \u00a34 white paint from a B&Q sale before putting four \u00a314.99 rugs she bought from The Range and decorating it with four \u00a32.50 lanterns from Ikea.\n\nShe and her partner Conor are currently renovating their cottage they share with children Niamh, 11, Skye, 6, and Toren, 15 months.\n\n(Image: Sarah Lindsey)\n\nHer thrifty transformation has drawn appreciations on social media.\n\nOne wrote in the comment: \"Sarah, the stairs look absolutely amazing!\"\n\nAnother said: \"It looks fab, love the lights, I think I need some more for our stairs!\"", "description": "Sarah Lindsey, from Perthshire in Scotland, was praised on social media after spending several days refurbishing the staircase at home", "authors": ["Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Sarah Lindsey"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658148.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-19-at-230507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
