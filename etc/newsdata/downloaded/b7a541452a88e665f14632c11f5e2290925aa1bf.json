This is a first in history, look how far we\u2019ve come. I\u2019m about to buy these for no reason whatsoever.\u2019\n\nThe dad and daughter displayed on the box come as part of the new line of eco-friendly nappies.\n\nSustainable and diverse, we stan.\n\nHuggies Special Delivery diapers are made from plant-based materials derived from sugarcane.\n\nThe baby-side liner and the diaper waistband are made from the stuff and it also boasts no parabens, fragrance and elemental chlorine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerfect for parents who are looking for more natural disposable options for their kids.\n\nThe new packaging won a tonne of praise on social media where many other users shared the news.\n\nJoe\u2019s post received more than 80,000 shares with over 5,000 comments commending the imagery.\n\n\u2018Outstanding! Finally shining a great light on black fathers! Good job. I\u2019ll buy some and give them away!\u2019 exclaimed one person.\n\nAnother said: \u2018Imagery is huge! And there\u2019s not enough of this subject/context in our media/advertising.\u2019\n\nOthers said it was also refreshing to see a dad on the packaging as baby advertising often uses women, focusing on the stereotypical idea that looking after children is just for women.\n\nSome, however, did have some complaints that Huggies isn\u2019t a black-owned business and could be cashing in on a diversity gimmick.\n\nOthers felt uncomfortable that the new line was rebranded in black packaging. They felt that it could\u2019ve maintained its original colours and still added the black family.\n\nFor the most part, people were pleased.\n\nOne mum said: \u2018My babies are all out of diapers as they\u2019re big kids now but I\u2019m going to buy this box just because it\u2019s beautiful!\u2019\n\nMORE: Primark\u2019s new model is representing the beauty of darker skin\n\nMORE: Primark\u2019s beautiful dark-skinned baby model sees himself in store for the first time\n\nMORE: Dads campaign for baby changing tables in men\u2019s toilets\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "In a Facebook post, dad Joe Flowers Jr from Chicago, Illinois, U.S, applauded Huggies for adding a black dad and daughter.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PRI_75832176_1563116082.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-07-14"}
