I think it is great for my life and my career.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say everyone is going to be shocked [by my professional wrestling skills]. It is something that I have always wanted to do, so I took the bull by the horns. If I get injured, I get injured.\n\n\u201cNobody can teach me how to box. What I don\u2019t know about boxing isn\u2019t worth knowing. That\u2019s a fact.\n\n\u201cI am unbeaten in 11 years, I am 30 fights unbeaten as a professional. I have won five World Championships and every honour there is to win in boxing, and I am still only 31.\n\n\u201cI can box with my eyes closed, I know every move there is to do. You cannot teach an old dog new tricks, so I am not bothered about the boxing, because I can always do that.\n\n\u201cIt is like riding a bike, no matter how long you go without riding a bike you will always be able to ride it when you get back on. For me it\u2019s the same with boxing. It is easy to me.\u201d\n\nFury\u2019s last boxing contest was a win over Otto Wallin in September, while he is still set to face Deontay Wilder in a rematch next year, with the previous bout between them in December 2018 having ended in a draw.\n\nFury received prize money of \u00a37 million after his bout with Wilder, but he maintains that neither fame nor money is behind his decision to take on Strowman.\n\n\u201cIt is lucrative, but at this stage of the game after all the fights and lucrativeness I have had, it is not about that. It is about enjoying life.\n\n\u201cI am not concerned about getting more profile than I have already got. I wish I didn\u2019t have a profile.\n\n\u201cPeople say they want to be famous. But there are a lot of sacrifices to be made for fame. To be a normal person is actually the best thing you can be.\n\n\u201cI said to my wife: \u2018Do you think I will ever live a normal life?\u2019 She said: \u2018No.\u2019 That\u2019s pretty s****y when a human being cannot live a normal life.\u201d\n\nConor McGregor has hinted in the last few days that he could be tempted to follow Fury into WWE, despite having announced his return to the UFC for January in Las Vegas.\n\nHowever, Fury laughed off suggestions that he could face the Irishman in the ring.\n\n\u201cWill I step into the ring with Conor McGregor? Are you crazy?\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that he is 5ft 7in and 10st and I am 6ft 9in and 20st, I don\u2019t think it would be very fair.\n\n\u201cMaybe if you put five Conor McGregors in there, with ten Floyd Mayweathers as well, then it may be even.\n\n\u201cWe have weight categories for a reason. You can\u2019t match small guys with big guys, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d", "description": "Tyson Fury has insisted the decision to plan a WWE fight against Braun Strowman\u00a0next week is a step in the right direction for his career.
