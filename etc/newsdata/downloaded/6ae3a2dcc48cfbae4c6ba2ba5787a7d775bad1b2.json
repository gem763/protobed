Bolton himself was scheduled to appear at the presser, before President Trump announced he had fired him.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on John Bolton's departure: \"The president has been very clear on this. The president's view of the Iraq War and Ambassador Bolton's was very different\" https://t.co/aZne0jSYgu pic.twitter.com/OePlt5oS4J \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) September 10, 2019\n\nORIGINAL POST\n\nPresident Trump has fired his national security advisor John Bolton. He shared the news on Twitter on Tuesday, explaining that he \"disagreed strongly\" with many of Bolton's suggestions.\n\n....I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\nThe announcement comes just a few days after Trump revealed he had cancelled a meeting with the Taliban at Camp David.\n\nBolton tweeted a response that appeared to counter Trump's take on the situation.\n\nI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \"Let's talk about it tomorrow.\" \u2014 John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) September 10, 2019\n\nHe also texted Fox News's Brian Kilmeade live on air during a taping of \"Outnumbered,\" telling Kilmeade to tell the audience he had \"resigned.\"\n\nBolton, who served in this capacity since April of 2018, also reportedly butted heads once or twice with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The former, one of the architects of the 2003 Iraq War, has often been criticized as a war hawk. Trump, by contrast, has maintained his long held opposition to the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq and has frequently voiced his desire to get out of other wars. Political pundits are frankly surprised that Bolton lasted in the Trump administration for so long.\n\nPompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin are expected to hold a press conference today at 1:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated.", "description": ".09/10/2019 19:24:58PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/210/d06dc22e-cc39-46b0-b3ac-68ba60aaf129.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
