It came as a complete surprise.\n\nI discovered this a few months back. My eight-year-old and I were on our way back from a dental appointment. It was during school hours and public transit seemed the best option \u2014 the bus passes directly in front of his school. Everything was going well. No cavities. Bus arrives on schedule. That\u2019s when it happens.\n\n'You know, that sounds more like a surcharge for parents than a child fare.'\n\nWe step onto the bus and I am asked for a fare I do not have or realize I needed.\n\n\u201cYou know children over five are supposed to pay a youth fare,\u201d the driver informs me. I am flummoxed. I slip my Presto card into my wallet, filled with other cards which won\u2019t do me much good.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t pay to get here,\u201d I wheedle.\n\n\u201cHe should have,\u201d she counters.\n\nThat\u2019s when inspiration struck: \u201cIf my son paid the youth fare would you allow him on the bus unaccompanied?\u201d My son looks horrified.\n\n\u201cKids under 10 must travel with an adult,\u201d she cautions.\n\n\u201cYou know, that sounds more like a surcharge for parents than a child fare,\u201d I point out, but I didn\u2019t press the matter. She didn\u2019t make the rules, after all. In the end, she let us both on with a promise to abandon our fare-dodging ways. Son looked incredibly relieved. I was too.\n\nRelevant Reading: How I\u2019m Teaching My Child To Ride Public Transit Without Me\n\nBut later, the incident began to irk me. We\u2019ve all heard the story of Adrian Crook, the single father from downtown Vancouver who ran afoul of child services for training his four oldest children to use transit unaccompanied. It isn\u2019t a routine choice I\u2019d make for my own family, but I respect his decision and sympathize with his plight. And I see my own experience as a much smaller, but related, issue.\n\nIf you won\u2019t allow children under 10 years old to use your service unaccompanied, you should not be charging them a fare.\n\nParents who live in the GTA are probably wondering why I am making such a big deal of this. Don\u2019t kids under 12 always ride for free? Yes, in Toronto, children under 12 have been allowed to use the TTC free of charge since 2015 and have enjoyed the same privilege on GO Transit since March of this year. Kudos to Toronto, but it is the outlier. Kids in most major Canadian cities do not enjoy a free ride or, rather, parents pay a surcharge.\n\nKudos to Toronto, but it is the outlier. Kids in most major Canadian cities do not enjoy a free ride or, rather, parents pay a surcharge.\n\nMontreal comes close with free rides on legal holidays, weekends and during the summer months for youth 12 and under. Youth enjoy a reduced rate most other times, but only kids younger than six years old ride for free. That latter part \u2014 reduced youth fares and free for very young kids \u2014 is more-or-less status quo with transit services in Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa-Gatineau, Winnipeg, Quebec City, Hamilton and Kitchener. Edmonton allows accompanied children under 12 to travel for free, with a negligible discount on tickets if the child travels on their own. None of the transit services stipulate a clear age at which children or youth can travel unaccompanied.\n\nIn fairness, I should point out that my own city, Ottawa, has the most deeply discounted youth fare of those cities where it isn't free. We no longer dodge the youth fare, but I still find it irksome.\n\nHow does my eight-year-old feel about this new transit fare bugbear of mine? Well, he thinks eight years old is a little young to be using transit solo, even in a pinch. Even 10 years old might be a little young, although he is not ruling it out. He also thinks Toronto is on the right track with this kids-ride-for-free thing.\n\nHe thinks I should write a letter to the mayor of Ottawa. Not a bad idea.", "description": "As far as I'm concerned, youth fares are really just a surcharge for accompanying parents.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/FreeTransitKid_RobThomas_lead.jpg"}
