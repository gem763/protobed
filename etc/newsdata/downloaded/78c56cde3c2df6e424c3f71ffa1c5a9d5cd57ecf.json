Unfortunately, at a stroke, this killed clinical academic research into innovative treatments that could be applied rapidly to the clinic,\u201d they added.\n\nThe scientists outlined the example of pancreatic cancer, where even if a clinical trial is successful to the point where there is no obstacle to licencing the drug, \u201cthe EU mechanism demands another randomised study on a scale that is commercially unaffordable\u201d.\n\nBritain Will Not Face Medicine Shortage After Brexit, Confirms NHS CEO https://t.co/mymQ7NDB6r \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 9, 2019\n\nThey continued that \u201cBig Pharma\u201d is producing oncology drugs costing some \u00a35,000 a month per patient, \u201cdue to the cost of these trials\u201d.\n\nProfessor Dalgleish and Professor Lewis also criticised the EU\u2019s obsession with \u201ccollaboration\u201d in research, which they said \u201cundermines innovation\u201d by forcing \u201clead\u201d research countries to partner with \u201cweaker sisters\u201d.\n\nThe EU also selects areas of technology or research to support \u201cwith collaboration being the driving spirit, rather than the pursuit of truly novel research\u2026Indeed, the whole point of these European collaborations appears to be promotion of harmonisation more than scientific innovation,\u201d they wrote. As a result, the EU programme becomes \u201ca mechanism for achieving new heights of mediocrity\u201d.\n\nThe professors also criticised Sir Paul Nurse for claiming Brexit would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for British science and dispelled the myth that the UK would be shut out of EU research programmes, giving examples of research which include partners from Switzerland and the USA.\n\nThe mainstream media has been replete with Project Fear stories that a clean-break, or \u2018no-deal\u2019, Brexit would result in medicine shortages and leave \u201cscience dead for years\u201d in the UK.\n\nEarlier this month, Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit planning, assured Britons that the government has put \u201cprocesses in place\u201d to support the \u201ctimely availability\u201d of drugs.\n\nDalgleish and Lewis reminded readers that it would be the EU losing out once the UK leaves, because \u201conly one of the top ten research universities in Europe will be in an EU country (Sweden), as eight of them are in the UK!\u201d\n\nPointing out that scientific research had flourished before the EU, the authors added: \u201cIn spite of our relatively small population, technological innovation is an integral part of our British history that has given rise to the most incredible inventions, from the steam train to the jet engine and from the telephone to the television \u2013 not to forget discovery of the DNA double helix.\n\n\u201cThe list goes on and on: none of these were done with EU funding.\u201d", "description": "Top scientists have said that the EU's Clinical Trial Directive is making medicine more expensive and research anti-competitive.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/clinical-researchers-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
