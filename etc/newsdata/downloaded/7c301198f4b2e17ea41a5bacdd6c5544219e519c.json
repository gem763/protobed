REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n\n(Reuters) - A panel of international air-safety regulators is finishing a report, which is expected to criticise the initial U.S. approval process for Boeing Co\u2019s (BA.N) 737 MAX jets, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people briefed on the conclusions.\n\nAs part of the panel\u2019s findings, the task force will call out the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for what it says is a lack of clarity and transparency in the way the agency delegated authority to Boeing to evaluate certain flight-control features, the Journal reported on Monday.\n\nThe final conclusion in some of these essential design changes did not receive adequate attention from the FAA, the report added.\n\nThe panel is expected to call for greater data-sharing and transparency among different governments, WSJ reported, with the draft report recommending reviewing and updating FAA guidance and day-to-day certification procedures to ensure the agency\u2019s early involvement in new onboard systems.\n\nThe multi-agency panel is called the Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) and includes air-safety regulators from Canada, China, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, the European Union, Brazil and the United States. It is expected to release the report in the next few weeks, the report said.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to the publication of the JATR report when it is complete,\u201d a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the company continues to work with global regulators to safely return the 737 MAX to service.\n\nBoeing\u2019s 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March after two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia within five months of each other. The FAA on Monday said its new chief, Stephen Dickson, plans to travel to Seattle this week to fly \u201cnewly configured\u201d Boeing 737 MAX software in a simulator.\n\nFAA did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment.", "description": "A panel of international air-safety regulators is finishing a report, which is expected to criticise the initial U.S. approval process for Boeing Co's 737 MAX jets, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people briefed on the conclusions.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430711604&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0AF", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
