REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares/File Photo\n\nMEXICO CITY/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Mexico has deported over 300 Indian nationals to New Delhi, the National Migration Institute (INM) said late on Wednesday, calling it an unprecedented transatlantic deportation.\n\nThe move follows a deal Mexico struck with the United States in June, vowing to significantly curb U.S.-bound migration in exchange for averting U.S. tariffs on Mexican exports.\n\n\u201cIt is unprecedented in INM\u2019s history - in either form or the number of people - for a transatlantic air transport like the one carried out on this day,\u201d INM said in a statement.\n\nThe 310 men and one woman that INM said were in Mexico illegally were sent on a chartered flight, accompanied by federal immigration agents and Mexico\u2019s National Guard. They arrived in New Delhi on Friday.\n\nMost of the deportees were from India\u2019s northern Punjab state, an Indian official said. Police will run checks if any of them had criminal history, another official said.\n\nINM said the deportees had been scattered in eight states around Mexico, including in southern Mexico from where many Indian migrants enter the country, hoping to transit to the U.S. border.\n\nThe backlog of migrants in southern Mexico has grown as officials have stopped issuing permits for them to cross the country, said Caitlyn Yates, a research coordinator at IBI Consultants who has studied increasing numbers of U.S.-bound Asian and African migrants arriving in Mexico.\n\n\u201cThis type of deportation in Mexico is the first of its kind but likely to continue,\u201d Yates said.", "description": "Mexico has deported over 300 Indian nationals to New Delhi, the National Migration Institute (INM) said late on Wednesday, calling it an unprecedented transatlantic deportation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441979824&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1UP", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
