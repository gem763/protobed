These recommendations are usually risk/reward commodities meant to be used in large-field tournaments. Typically, blending these low-owned hidden gems with well-aligned staples contributes to a viable GPP strategy.\n\nKeep in mind that the following player write-ups were constructed earlier in the day, and sometimes injury/rest situations can alter the fantasy landscape. Monitoring our MLB News & Headlines Feed throughout the day will keep you in the loop while giving you the subsequent DFS consequences of each information piece.\n\nWe will be looking at the 13-game main slate beginning at 7:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nSandy Alcantara - Miami (at San Francisco)\n\nAlcantara is fresh off his best outing of the season, racking up eight strikeouts in a complete-game shutout (4 hits, 2 walks) against the Royals last Sunday. In fact, Alcantara has been pitching reasonably well over the past month now. There\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll keep that form while traveling to San Francisco\u2019s pitcher-friendly ballpark. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the Giants rank 27th in wRC+ this season.\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nMiguel Cabrera - Detroit (vs. Baltimore)\n\nCabrera\u2019s Triple-Crown years are far behind him, but he has been a sneaky-good DFS asset by registering multiple hits in five of his last seven games. He\u2019s clearly seeing the ball well, which could lead to a strong fantasy performance against Baltimore RHP Aaron Brooks (.348 wOBA vs. RHB) and a terrible Orioles\u2019 bullpen.\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nIsan Diaz - Miami (at San Francisco)\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s not much opportunity cost at second base tonight, which comes as a surprise considering the extended 13-game slate. Diaz represents an interesting mid-range pick within that, and his ownership rate will likely be tamed by a lack of name recognition - not to mention playing for one of the worst offenses in baseball. However, Diaz has been swinging a hot bat recently with four hits, one double, one triple, one homer, and four RBIs over his past three games. He\u2019s looking at a favorable draw against San Francisco RHP Tyler Beede\u2019s career .365 wOBA split to left-handed bats.\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nMatt Chapman - Oakland (at Texas)\n\nUnlike second base, the third base position has more than enough quality options to choose from. Nolan Arenado, DJ LeMahieu, Manny Machado, Kyle Seager, and Yoan Moncada are only a few that headline the list. There\u2019s a chance that Oakland 3B Matt Chapman will get lost in the shuffle despite finding himself in a comfortable matchup against Texas LHP Brock Burke. Getting a substantial park shift in Texas could feed his upside as well.\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nTim Anderson - Chicago White Sox (at Seattle)\n\nAnderson has been featured in this spot numerous times throughout the season. He usually slips through the cracks for tournaments, as he doesn\u2019t nearly have the pedigree (or name recognition) as the other noteworthy shortstops. However, you can\u2019t deny Anderson\u2019s upside thanks to an exciting blend of contact, power, and speed. That could be on full display tonight against Seattle LHP Yusei Kikuchi, who has struggled throughout the better part of this season (.367 wOBA vs. RHB). Eloy Jimenez and Jose Abreu of the White Sox are on my tournament shortlist as well.\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nAdam Eaton - Washington (vs. Atlanta)\n\nAtlanta RHP Mike Soroka has been great this season while holding an impressive 2.67 ERA. Having said that, the Braves\u2019 righty has encountered some turbulence lately, allowing seven earned runs and 12 hits across 11 innings over his past two starts. Eaton slapped a double and homer off Soroka last Sunday, and the Washington OF could keep his hot hitting alive tonight. Most people will ignore Eaton while taking a look at Soroka\u2019s season-long numbers, but keep in mind that the Atlanta hurler is vulnerable at the moment.\n\nHarold Castro - Detroit (vs. Baltimore)\n\nI briefly outlined the matchup for Detroit\u2019s offense tonight, as they\u2019ll step in against Baltimore RHP Brooks and a generous Orioles\u2019 bullpen. Castro could get in on the fun while looking to take advantage of Brooks\u2019 .376 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Castro has been sneaky-good in recent games, collecting 14 hits over his last six starts. Keep him in mind for large-field tournaments.", "description": "Spencer Limbach uncovers some sneaky-good MLB GPP Pivots away from the popular picks for Friday, September 13.
