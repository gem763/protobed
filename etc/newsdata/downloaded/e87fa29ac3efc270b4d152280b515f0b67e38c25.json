But, by the same token, if he starts making himself eight cups a day and kicking back with his crew in the sunshine, that can also be a sign that your new kitchen extension definitely won\u2019t be ready by Christmas.\n\nWhen placing their tea order, many builders rejoice in being more fussy than Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally as they reel off the exact amount of milk and sugar they require, and specify whether the spoon and teabag should be left in or out of the mug.\n\nOne builder working at Buckingham Palace, according to a new documentary, pushed these customs to the limit when he got into the detail of the vessel he wanted his tea served in.\n\nWhile working underneath a table in one of the palace\u2019s grander private rooms, the builder responded to a disembodied female voice asking him if he would like a cup of tea by replying: \u201cYeah. In a mug. Two sugars. Builder\u2019s tea. I don\u2019t want any of that nonsense I had the last time I was here, all that fine china and all that saucer stuff.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, the well-spoken woman returned and said: \u201cI\u2019ve put your tea on the table here.\u201d\n\nHe peered up and saw the familiar outline of the Queen leaving the room.\n\nThe story is related by Kevin Andrews, the former royal upholsterer to the late Queen Mother, in a forthcoming Channel 5 show Secrets of the Royal Palaces.\n\nThe documentary also reveals that there used to be a bar at Buckingham Palace, but it was shut down after staff got \u201cworse for wear\u201d once too often.", "description": "A builder toiling under a palace desk told a disembodied voice he wanted his tea  with no frills, only to realize, after it was delivered, that his interlocutor was Her Majesty.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3517,w_6254,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568893444/RTX6Q1M5_zccfv6", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
