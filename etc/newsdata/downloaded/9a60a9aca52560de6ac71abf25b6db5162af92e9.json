I do not know any player who likes to sit on the bench.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s said something like this. He\u2019s a really good goalie who always wants to play, and that\u2019s clear to me, too, and he showed a good performance.\n\n\u201cWe have a great relationship like always. We are talking normally. Marc did well against Argentina. It\u2019s all about the team for us.\n\nGermany\u00b4s goalkeepers Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, right, and Manuel Neuer (Martin Meissner/PA)\n\n\u201cI would have preferred to play both games, clearly. But tomorrow is a competitive game, it\u2019s about points. I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nThere have been suggestions, most recently from former Germany keeper Rene Adler to Sport1 on Saturday, that 33-year-old Neuer will remain as first choice until after next summer\u2019s tournament before handing over to Ter Stegen, 27.\n\nNeuer appeared to dismiss that idea by noting that Schalke youngster Alexander Nubel, who has been praised by national team goalkeeping coach Andreas Kopke, \u201cmay be\u201d his eventual successor in the national team.\n\nAnd he added: \u201cCurrently there\u2019s nothing to announce.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fit and performing well, so there\u2019s no reason to think about ending my career.\u201d\n\nBoth Ilkay Gundogan and Timo Werner are in contention to join Neuer in Sunday\u2019s line-up after training with no ill effects as manager Joachim Low revealed the squad\u2019s injury situation had \u201ccalmed down a bit\u201d.\n\nSerge Gnabry is certain to start after following up his four goals in Bayern\u2019s 7-2 Champions League win over Tottenham with the opener against Argentina.\n\nLow said: \u201cHe has the qualities to play at the highest of levels. As he\u2019s shown over the past year, if he\u2019s fit then he simply has to play.\u201d\n\nHolland\u2019s win over Northern Ireland left those two teams level on points with Germany at the top of qualifying group C and Low admits his side, without a play-off safety net after their Nations League failure, must win on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d he said in comments reported on the national team\u2019s Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to drop any more points in our group so I\u2019m expecting a professional performance.\u201d\n\nOpposite number Karel Voolaid admits Estonia will have to work hard defensively to improve on June\u2019s 8-0 loss in Mainz.\n\n\u201cWe need to get more done in defence, particularly with our position \u2013 it is important to limit the opposition\u2019s chances,\u201d he told Estonian newspaper Postimees.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely big game but I hope there are more of them to come. Maybe we can give the home crowd a gift and surprise Germany.\u201d", "description": "Neuer insists he has a good relationship with Marc-Andre Ter Stegen.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/18/wire-19632030-1570901323-117_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
