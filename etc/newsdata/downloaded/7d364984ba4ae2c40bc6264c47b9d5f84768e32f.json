But Jess Davidson, executive director of the advocacy organization End Rape on Campus, confirmed to TIME that the group was chanting about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\n\nDavidson also tweeted that the protestors were chanting \u201cwe are DACA recipients. Our lives are at risk.\u201d She also wrote that at least some protesters got on the stage.\n\nThe protestors were yelling, \u201cwe are DACA recipients. Our lives are at risk.\u201d Unclear if they were TSU students. #DemDebate #DemocratDebate \u2014 Jess Davidson (@DavidsonJess22) September 13, 2019\n\nDavidson told TIME via Twitter that she was \u201cin the front row of the side stand near them and watched them be escorted out.\u201d\n\nAnother person also tweeted a video of a man wearing a shirt that read \u201cDefend DACA, Abolish ICE, citizenship for all\u201d being escorted out of the debate.\n\nHunter Schwarz, a reporter for Yello Zine, also tweeted photos of protestors being removed.\n\nOne of the protesters at the debate tonight wore a shirt that said \"No human being is illegal on stolen land\u201d on the back https://t.co/osexJlAYQp pic.twitter.com/rbIsI2PpHP \u2014 Hunter Schwarz (@hunterschwarz) September 13, 2019\n\nThe protestors interrupted Biden right as he was about to discuss the death of his wife and daughter in a tragic car crash. Some people on Twitter labeled the move insensitive \u2014 or at the very least incredibly poor timing.\n\nThe protestors actually helped Joe Biden by making him appear more sympathetic when he talked about family and hardships. We couldn\u2019t even hear what the protestors were saying. That was a bad move that backfired. #DemDebate \u2014 Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) September 13, 2019\n\nso the protesters waited until Biden was about to talk about his wife and daughter dying to start shouting \u2014 Edward-Isaac Dovere (@IsaacDovere) September 13, 2019\n\n\"Losing him was like losing part of my soul,\" Biden on Beau... Pretty unfortunate that the protesters would choose that moment to scream. \u2014 Randi Marshall (@randimarshall) September 13, 2019\n\nThis is the second time protestors have interrupted a presidential primary debate. In July, protestors interrupted CNN\u2019s debate in Detroit by protests about immigration and the New York City police department.", "description": "The protestors interrupted Biden during an answer about his wife and his daughter dying in a car accident", "authors": ["Madeleine Carlisle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cgaQshVvZDc.LMhXVWv2VQ--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/b3392db22fd86d01178a3dfea3815459", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
