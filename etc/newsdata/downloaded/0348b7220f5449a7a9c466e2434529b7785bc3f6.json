Photo: Chesnot/Getty Images\n\nFacebook\u2019s UK company paid just \u00a328m in taxes in 2018, even though its revenue surged by more than 30% to \u00a31.6bn.\n\nNew accounts filed by the company show that it made only \u00a396.6m in pre-tax profits, largely because it paid more than \u00a3666m in unexplained \u201cadministrative expenses\u201d and nearly \u00a3860m in sales costs.\n\nThat means that only about 6% of its gross revenue, which mainly comes from advertisers, was converted into taxable profits.\n\nNet revenue from advertisers at Facebook UK climbed by more than 50%, to \u00a3797m.\n\nIn 2018, Facebook (FB) had almost 2,000 employees in the UK, or about 5% of its global workforce. The 2018 headcount is up from about 1,300 in the previous year.\n\nREAD MORE: Heathrow Airport commits to being net carbon neutral\n\nThe company provides marketing services, support, and engineering services to other parts of Facebook\u2019s global operation. About 56% of its UK employees are engineering staff, while 857 work in sales support and marketing.\n\nThe UK company paid more \u00a3230m in wages and salaries to those employees, while research and development costs climbed by 34% to \u00a3356m.\n\n\u201cThe UK is now one of Facebook\u2019s most important hubs for global innovation. We continue to grow and invest heavily in the UK and by the end of the year we\u2019ll employ 3,000 people here,\u201d said Steve Hatch, vice-president for Northern Europe at Facebook, on Friday.\n\nHatch noted that, since April 2016, revenue from large UK customers supported by teams in the country was recorded in the UK, such that \u201cany taxable profit [relating to those customers] is subject to UK corporation tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese high-skilled jobs are not only working on products like WhatsApp and Workplace but also help develop technology to proactively detect and remove malicious content from our platforms. Businesses across the country use our platforms to grow and revenue from customers supported by our UK teams is now recorded here so that any taxable profit is subject to UK corporation tax.\u201d\n\nThe accounts were published just two days after international leaders announced progress on a plan to prevent large multinational companies such as Facebook from avoiding taxes by shifting profits between countries.\n\nA proposal released on Wednesday by the OECD would allow countries to tax huge companies on the actual sales within their territories, rather than on the profits booked in their accounts.\n\nThe OECD said that the current rules, which are around a century old, \u201care no longer sufficient to ensure a fair allocation of taxing rights in an increasingly globalised world.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Dyson scraps \u00a32.5bn electric car project\n\nLast month, Amazon was criticised for paying just \u00a314.7m in taxes in the UK, despite making more than \u00a32.3bn in revenue.\n\nThe change would not just impact technology companies, but rather many highly profitable firms, including car brands.\n\nMany large companies pay taxes in lower tax jurisdictions on sales generated elsewhere.\n\nCountries such as Ireland, whose tax laws have been under scrutiny for years, would stand to lose from the proposals.\n\nIreland is home to the European headquarters of major technology companies like Facebook, but the country\u2019s low 12.5% corporate tax rate has frustrated other countries. Many giants in the country pay effective tax rates that are even lower.\n\nLarger countries, such as the US, China, and the UK would benefit from the new OECD framework if it came into effect.", "description": "Only about 6% of the company's gross revenue, which mainly comes from advertisers, was converted into taxable profits.", "authors": ["Edmund Heaphy", "Finance", "News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZxEWyOlUfzpC0AkpYoPpVQ--~B/aD0zMjQxO3c9NDk3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6d141010-ebff-11e9-b52f-a0e20ba33663", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
