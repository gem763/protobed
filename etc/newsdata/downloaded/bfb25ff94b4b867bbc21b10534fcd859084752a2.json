We understand each other, that ultimately we have to be guided by the Companies Act in terms how we deal with issues of remuneration,\" Hako said.\n\nThe PIC will attend an AGM with the Treasury in November, where the remuneration policy will be tabled. \"One of the key issues coming out of that is the practice of National Treasury to impose particular conditions,\" he said.\n\nHako said that whatever conditions are imposed must be \"harmonised\" with the remuneration policy.\n\n\"If we come to a point of harmonisation, the contradictions will be eliminated,\" Hako said.\n\nMabece, however, told Fin24 via WhatsApp message that the employees are adamant in rejecting the \"interference\" of the finance minister.", "description": "The PIC board is engaging with Treasury to develop a new remuneration policy for staff, members of Parliament heard.", "authors": ["Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7335/730bc18143ba4ea296af6541d3f05edd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
