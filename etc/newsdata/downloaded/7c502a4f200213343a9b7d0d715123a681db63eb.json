In fact, people are so hush-hush about their finances that they would rather talk about their sex life than their credit card debt at a dinner party, according to a report from Motley Fool\u2019s The Ascent. That survey found that almost 57 per cent of respondents think it\u2019s taboo to discuss personal finances regardless of time and place. And that stigma may leave you feeling lost when you want to discuss your financial goals, understand your setbacks, or celebrate your achievements.\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s easier to talk about money with strangers, especially those who are in a similar financial situation to yours. Or those strangers may have been in your shoes before and can offer advice without criticising the actions that led to your current circumstances, whether it\u2019s good or bad.\n\nThat\u2019s where the power of the internet comes in handy. When you need a jolt of motivation or a place to commiserate about how bored you are already with the lunches you meal-prepped for the week, you can turn to these supportive online groups. Best of all: They\u2019re free.\n\nFacebook communities\n\nYou\u2019re logged into Facebook already, so why not use that convenience to find a new personal finance community or two?\n\nThis group, a companion to the blog And Then We Saved, focuses on using spending fasts (which you might know as no-spend challenges) to pay off debt faster. If you\u2019re laser-focused on getting out of debt, this is the group for you.\n\nThe Frugal Friends podcast emphasises that you don\u2019t have to take extreme steps to improve your finances. The show\u2019s Facebook group with about 1,100 participants is welcoming to newbies and frugal pros alike.\n\nThis group from the Dough Roller blog keeps it broad, inviting conversations about money and investing, but with a more manageable group size \u2014 about 7,500 participants.\n\nSubreddits\n\nThe amount of activity on Reddit can be overwhelming, so here are two subreddits I enjoy perusing that can help you dip into money topics.\n\nThis is the catch-all for budgeting, saving, getting out of debt, investing and everything in between. If there\u2019s a more specific forum that suits your inquiry (like using credit cards to earn travel rewards, for example), other users will point the way.\n\nWant to save more and spend smarter? This subreddit will teach you how to coupon, work the circular, and make the most of your pantry. You can also read some \u201cfrugal fails,\u201d which will make you feel better when your attempts to save money go horribly wrong.\n\nTraditional forums\n\nDo you miss the olden days of the internet? Lucky for you, forums still exist. Start with one of these:\n\nFans of the robust comments section at now-closed site The Billfold (which Lifehacker writer Nicole Dieker used to run) can find that community in the forums for personal finance education site Oh My Dollar. Topics range from budgeting to parenting, and there\u2019s even a thread for sharing your financial victories with the group.\n\nHashtags\n\nSure, performative social media can make you feel bad about your money (or lack of it). But if you follow a few select hashtags, you can find motivational posts with lots of tips and strategies for reaching your financial goals.\n\nOn Instagram, try #debtfreecommunity and #debtfreejourney to connect with users who are paying off debt or have already achieved it.\n\nIf you prefer Twitter, WiseBread hosts a weekly chat, #WBChat, on Fridays to discuss personal finance. There\u2019s a different topic each week.", "description": "Discussing money is still generally frowned upon.
