When I was little, I was captivated by Bratz dolls\u2019 huge drawn-on lashes and heavy bedroom eyes, despite not being allowed to play with them. (We were a Barbie household.) Twiggy was my beauty icon before I even started wearing makeup. When the time came, mascara was the first beauty product I was allowed to wear out of the house. To this day, I'll apply a few coats on my lashes even when I know I won't be leaving my apartment. It just makes me feel like myself.\n\nIn my 10-plus years as a mascara wearer, I\u2019ve probably burned through 1,000 tubes of the stuff. I've racked up a solid list of favorites. However, I earned my title as a true Lash Obsessive only when I got extensions this fall. Mascara is a transformative product for sure (especially when you have lashes as sparse as mine), but it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to the power of extensions.\n\nMe with lash extensions (RIP) Courtesy of Bella Cacciatore\n\nI was hooked from the get-go. My lash extensions made me feel glamorous in an Old Hollywood way. I could be wearing jeans and a T-shirt, but I felt camera-ready. I understood why suddenly everyone on Instagram was trading in the mascara. But of course, there's a catch: Lash extensions are expensive and high-maintenance. Plus, they irritated my sensitive eyes. After about three months, I kissed my extensions goodbye and returned to my stash of drugstore mascaras.\n\nI\u2019ve been a longtime fan of L'Or\u00e9al mascaras. (Telescopic is my OG fave.) Having tasted the extension side of life, I decided to give a new formula a go. So I reached for the brand's new Voluminous X Fiber Mascara\u2014a Glamour Beauty Award Winner. And it was love at first swipe.\n\nAs the name suggests, the Voluminous X Fiber is a fiber mascara that uses a two-step system to build lashes up to almost extension status.", "description": "L'Or\u00e9al Paris' Voluminous X Fiber is the best drugstore fiber mascara I've ever used.
