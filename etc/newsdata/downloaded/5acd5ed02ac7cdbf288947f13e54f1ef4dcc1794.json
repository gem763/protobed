This has seen significant success with two hundred thousand travellers validated since launch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to expand our strategic partnership with Mobeewave. Our companies are aligned with our vision of driving frictionless and effortless payment acceptance and validation across Australia. Through Mobeewave\u2019s patented, PCI-compliant contactless payment processing platform, and by leveraging our Digital Enablement Platform, we are paving the way for Australia to be a world leader in frictionless, effortless and secure payment innovation,\u201d said James King, Senior Vice President of Sales and Global Markets, Digital Business Unit, IDEMIA.\n\n\u201cBricks and mortar businesses are increasingly frustrated with the complexities of accepting payments. Ninety-seven per cent of all Australian companies are micro and small businesses*, and they have been underserved for far too long by the lack of easy, frictionless and affordable card payment acceptance solutions. What\u2019s more, together with IDEMIA, we have been able to adapt our technology to provide public transport companies with a simple payment validation tool, driving innovation and simplicity across a variety of sectors. We look forward to broadening the scope of our partnership with IDEMIA across Australia,\u201d added Benjamin du Ha\u00ffs, co-Founder, Mobeewave.\n\n*Source: https://www.asbfeo.gov.au/sites/default/files/Small_Business_Statistical_Report-Final.pdf\n\nAbout Mobeewave\n\nMobeewave is a global pioneer in contactless payment acceptance solutions.
