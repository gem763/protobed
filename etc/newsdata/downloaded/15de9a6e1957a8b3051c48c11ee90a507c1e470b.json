Donald Trump\u2019s policies have exposed a vulnerability in China\u2019s export-dependent economic model that relies too much on theft and predatory behavior against foreign companies. Beijing must impose currency controls to stop capital flight by Chinese who want a safe haven abroad. This retrenchment in economic reform has coincided with increasingly draconian political control at home. Self-confident regimes don\u2019t jail human-rights lawyers, crack down on churches, or create a Great Firewall and employ tens of thousands of censors to control the internet. Most horrifying has been the effort to eliminate the culture and religion of the Uighur Muslim population in the western region of Xinjiang. The use of AI and facial recognition to control the public calls to mind Orwell\u2019s nightmare of state control.\n\nFor the Muslim minority in Xinjiang, 1984 is a documentary. CNN published a series of charts today, one which shows that since 2010 China has spent more on \u201cdomestic security\u201d than it has on external defense. In other words, for all the big-ticket military items you see in the parade today (video below), China is spending even more to maintain tight control it\u2019s own people.\n\nJay Nordlinger offers 70 million additional reasons not to celebrate the existence of the Chinese dictatorship:\n\nThe Communist dictatorship in China has killed something like 70 million people. It is hard to focus on millions of people, as I was saying the other day. Let\u2019s try one \u2014 one person. A few months ago, Wang Meiyu held up a sign calling on Party boss Xi Jinping to step down and for free elections to be held. Wang was tortured to death. His wife could not recognize the body. Wang was 38 years old and had two young children.\n\nThis photo shows what will get you brutally murdered by the state in China:\n\nHuman rights activist Wang Meiyu is dead. He was 38. Picked up two months ago in perfect health, trundled off to a military prison. \"When I saw his body, it was like another person; he was totally unrecognizable,\" said his widow, Cao Shuxia. https://t.co/XnpaaP6Gff \u2014 Terry Glavin (@TerryGlavin) September 25, 2019\n\nLast year, Jonah Goldberg pointed out that in addition to being ruthless, China is also racist, though you don\u2019t hear much about that from the American left:\n\nIn China, there is systemic discrimination against non-Han Chinese. Ethnic minorities \u2014 about 10% of the Chinese population \u2014 are routinely denied access to elite universities and urban job markets in the name of Han supremacy. Under China\u2019s internal passport system, many non-Han aren\u2019t permitted to even look for work outside of their rural provinces. Tibetan and Uighur citizens are often barred from using Chinese hotels. Not only does China have its own version of Jim Crow, it still has its own version of slavery. Under its prison labor system, Laogai \u2014 \u201creform through work\u201d \u2014 millions of slaves churn out all manner of \u201cMade in China\u201d wares and even provide many of the organs for transplant surgeries in China.\n\nWhen you add all this up, communist China\u2019s 70th anniversary is a sad day for the Chinese people though of course, they don\u2019t dare say so. Here\u2019s a bit of the big celebration:\n\nAnd here\u2019s how they\u2019re celebrating Xi Jinping in Hong Kong:\n\nSome protesters have stuck portraits of Xi Jinping onto Nathan Road pic.twitter.com/23qfb5pfOb \u2014 Elaine Yu (@yuenok) October 1, 2019", "description": "\"...there is no force that can shake the foundation of this great nation\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/China-national-day.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
