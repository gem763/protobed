Where should I retire?", "language": "en", "text": "Dear Catey,\n\nI am 43 years old and plan to retire at 62. As a member of Gen X, I already know that Social Security will most likely not be around for me. I plan to retire on $1.2 million in retirement savings. I\u2019ve already decided it won\u2019t be in the U.S. Where can I live to stretch my retirement dollars? Must have low cost of living, low health-care costs, low crime and be near a beach. Thank you for your help.\n\nN.W.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDear N.W.,\n\nI\u2019m getting more interest from readers these days on retiring abroad \u2014 mostly because they feel they can get more bang for their buck outside of the U.S. They often can, but going abroad can have big downsides, including higher crime, being far from your family, and not-so-great-health care.\n\nThat said, your $1.2 million future nest egg could stretch a lot further in many spots abroad than it would in the U.S. Plus, though you doubt Social Security will be around for you, many experts say that you can count on it \u2014 even if benefits are cut somewhat. As Marketwatch\u2019s Alessandra Malito recently reported: \u201cMany Americans believe Social Security won\u2019t exist when they retire \u2014 they\u2019re wrong. Social Security does face serious challenges, and the payout may decline \u2014 but the program itself is not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nHere are some places that meet most of your criteria, with one caveat: While this is all true today, a lot could change over the next 19 years. Still, I love that you\u2019re planning so far ahead.

And Coronado in particular \u2014 which is roughly an hour west of Panama City on the Pacific Ocean \u2014 is considered a very safe community with \u201ca top-notch medical facility,\u201d says Suzan Haskins, a senior editor at International Living.\n\nOnce a resort town for affluent Panamanians, in recent decades Coronado \u2014 whose beaches feature black-and-white speckled sand \u2014 has become popular with expats, who enjoy the golf, shopping and restaurants in the area.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also pretty affordable: If you don\u2019t live right by the beach, you can live on under $2,000 a month, with the added bonus of taking advantage of Panama\u2019s pensionado visa program, which offers a ton of discounts for seniors. One downside is that because it is a resort town it can feel hectic at times because of tourism.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nGeorge Town, Malaysia\n\niStock George Town\n\nMalaysia snagged International Living\u2019s top spot for international health care and landed on Investopedia\u2019s top 10 cheapest and safest countries to retire in. What\u2019s more, George Town itself scored a spot on U.S. News\u2019 best places to retire in Asia list, with the publication noting that it is one of \u201cSoutheast Asia\u2019s most livable destinations\u201d with \u201clow costs,\u201d \u201cexcellent\u201d health care and expat perks like the fact that \u201cforeigners are welcome\u201d and \u201cEnglish is widely spoken.\u201d\n\nAs for those beaches you\u2019re dreaming of, U.S. News also points out that \u201calmost on the city\u2019s doorstep are stylish seaside settlements with palm-fringed sandy beaches and a backdrop of lush rainforest.\u201d You\u2019ll also enjoy great food, interesting architecture (one section of the city is a Unesco World Heritage site) and a fun arts scene. However, it\u2019ll be a long flight \u2014 you\u2019ll often spend more than a day traveling \u2014 to come back and visit friends and family in the states.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMerida, Mexico\n\niStock M\u00e9rida\n\nAffordable, culturally rich Merida \u2014 which I recently recommended to a woman who was hoping to retire near the beach in Mexico on under $1,200 a month \u2014 seems to meet most of your requirements too.\n\nThough it\u2019s not right on the beach, it\u2019s just 25 miles from the famed sugar-sand beaches of the Yucat\u00e1n\u2019s Gulf Coast (it\u2019s hard to beat those beaches in terms of natural beauty) \u2014 and Merida, which has a population of upward of 800,000, has the added benefit of offering great food, plenty of events to entertain you and a thriving expat community. Dan Prescher, the senior editor at International Living, also points out that health care here is \u201ca fraction of what you\u2019d pay in the U.S.\u201d and many of the doctors went to medical school in America and speak English.\n\nThough it might not be the safest place on this list (the U.S. Department of State puts the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula as a whole at a Level 2, which means exercise increased caution), Merida itself is known as one of the safest cities in Mexico and people generally say they feel safe living here. \u201cFor my money, Merida, the capital of Yucat\u00e1n State in Mexico, has it all when it comes to affordability, low crime, and access to great health care,\u201d Prescher says.", "description": "The destination must also be outside the U.S. Here are 3 places to consider.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU146_gt_ZG_20191028124839.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
