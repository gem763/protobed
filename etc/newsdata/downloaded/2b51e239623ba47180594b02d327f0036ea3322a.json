She has resisted impeachment for months as her caucus has grown restless. She was considering the House Democratic majority. I thought she was disciplined and strategic.\n\nShe got ahead of the facts and now she is trapped.\n\nAs the transcript of the July phone call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president was released Wednesday morning, several key claims made by Democrats and their media allies unraveled.\n\nThere was no \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d We were promised that Mr. Trump was explicit. The transcript shows no evidence of that.\n\nThe president did not mention defense aid even once. We were promised that Mr. Trump withheld defensive foreign aid as a bribe to secure an investigation of the Bidens. He did not mention the subject of defensive aid once during the call.\n\nThe only investigation that Mr. Trump brought up himself, unprompted, was an investigation into foreign meddling in the 2016 election, as it related to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee email server. Democrats used to care deeply about this subject.\n\nThe Ukrainian president was the first to mention Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and he asked that Mr. Giuliani travel to Ukraine.\n\nDespite news reports that Mr. Trump urged an investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter as many as eight times on the call, the transcript shows he mentioned them only once. The Ukrainian president specifically said Wednesday he did not feel pressured by Mr. Trump.\n\nThis is far too thin for the extreme constitutional remedy of impeachment.\n\nWhen the public is against the party pushing impeachment, pushing forward with this drastic step is bad politics. Republicans learned this painful lesson in the 1990s.\n\nDemocrats have now committed themselves to this extreme step, and they have set themselves up to fail their rabid base or pursue a path the public opposes.\n\nIt appears Democrats learned nothing from the Russia collusion hoax.\n\nAfter more than two years of Democrats\u2019 hyperventilating, Mr. Trump was cleared of collusion and conspiracy. Democrats and their media allies overhyped their claims and won Pulitzer Prizes along the way. But they failed in their objective, and soon we will learn more about the origins of the Russia collusion hoax and FISA warrant abuses.\n\nI will make a prediction.\n\nIn the end, the Ukraine investigation and resulting impeachment inquiry will be far worse for Mr. Biden than it will be for Mr. Trump.\n\nWill the former vice president\u2019s calls to Ukraine be released? How many trips did he make there? Who did he meet with? How did his son, with zero experience in Ukraine or energy, secure a $50,000 a month contract with a Ukrainian natural gas company and a highly lucrative contract for his bank?\n\nThese questions deserve answers.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint has now been provided to the House and Senate Intelligence committees. The Intelligence Community Inspector General said the whistleblower had \u201cpartisan bias\u201d in his or her background. We have also learned that the whistleblower never even heard the phone call directly.\n\nAlmost everything Democrats have said about this story is probably false.\n\nSoon we will hear from acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire in his testimony before Congress. He will provide additional answers and context.\n\nInstead of overhyping this story, Democrats should have been more careful and measured. But they could not help themselves.\n\nInstead, their hatred of Mr. Trump led to them getting out on a limb. That limb was just sawed off.\n\n\u2022 Matt Mackowiak is president of Austin, Texas, and Washington, D.C.-based Potomac Strategy Group.
