Owen Farrell could be seen smiling during the performance on the big screen and New Zealand\u2019s Aaron Smith said afterwards that England\u2019s captain had winked at him while it was taking place.\n\nWe\u2019ve beaten the god of rugby but we still must improve, says Eddie Jones Read more\n\nEngland have a history of countering the haka \u2014 in 1997, the players advanced on the All Blacks with Richard Cockerill memorably getting up close and personal with Norm Hewitt before their 26-26 draw. After Saturday\u2019s semi-final, New Zealand\u2019s captain, Kieran Read, insisted it \u201chad no impact on the game\u201d but Manu Tuilagi scored the opening try inside 98 seconds.\n\nTuilagi said it was designed to show that England were \u201cready for anything\u201d. In 2008 Wales stood their ground after New Zealand\u2019s haka while France formed an arrow before the 2011 World Cup final. On both occasions, the All Blacks went on to win.\n\n\u201cWe talked about it as a team but everything has to get past the boss,\u201d said Mako Vunipola. \u201cHe gave us the idea. We wanted to be respectful but we wanted to also make sure that they understood that we would be ready for the fight. We knew it would rile them up, it probably felt like we disrespected them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England players look on while New Zealand players perform the haka.

There have been a few times in the past when the All Blacks have done that and blown the opposition away. We put accountability on ourselves to back it up and I thought we did.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\n\nFrance were fined \u00a32,500 by World Rugby for their formation and Vunipola hinted that England may face a similar punishment, with Joe Marler creeping closer to the All Blacks than his teammates. \u201cHe said he got confused,\u201d Vunipola added. \u201cHe thought he was supposed to go all the way around it and go to their 10m line. But because of that, he\u2019s the one who has to pay the fine. He dishes it out a lot so the boys would be more than happy if he has to pay it.\u201d\n\nOwen Farrell added: \u201cWe wanted to keep a respectful distance but we didn\u2019t just want to stand in a flat line and let them come at us.\u201d", "description": "It was Eddie Jones\u2019s idea to line his England players in a V-formation while TJ Perenara led the haka, according to Mako Vunipola", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/692e210aa6ef342e3b9454379d45ce6810796f9e/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5e95a84d7e6c24328b53fb0053adb4f5", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
