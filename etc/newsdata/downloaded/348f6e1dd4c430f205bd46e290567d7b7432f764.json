The 66-year-old investor died Aug. 10 of an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was in custody awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.\n\nAfter an autopsy in mid-August, Barbara Sampson, the chief medical examiner in New York City, said Epstein\u2019s cause of death was suicide by hanging, which she determined after \u201ccareful review of all investigative information.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s death has sparked a host of suspicion partly because he was put in the suicide-watch unit on July 23, weeks prior to his eventual demise, but had been removed soon after when a psychological evaluation found him fit enough not to be monitored.\n\nHe had pleaded not guilty to the government\u2019s allegations that he led a sex-trafficking scheme to lure young women and girls to his homes in Florida and New York.\n\nBaden, however, told Fox News that Epstein\u2019s death was more consistent with a homicide, citing fractures in the financier\u2019s neck that are typically associated with strangulation. He also said bleeding in Epstein\u2019s eyes were also typical of someone being strangled.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s evidence here of homicide that should be investigated, to see if it is or isn\u2019t homicide,\u201d Baden said.", "description": "Dr. Michael Baden tells Fox News that he didn\u2019t believe that sex offender Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s death in a jail cell on Aug. 10 was a suicide, and harbored many...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO551_epstei_ZG_20190731192711.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
