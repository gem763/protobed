May's regional, national and European elections saw a surge in support for environmental parties. The Greens are now the second-largest party in the Brussels regional government, just behind the traditionally dominant Socialists. They've formed a broader coalition government and their joint agreement has a heavy dose of transport policy.\n\n\u201cTwenty-seven percent of CO2 emissions come from car traffic ... Traffic jams cost us between \u20ac4 billion and \u20ac8 billion in economic value every year. Also consider health: We know that the lungs of children growing up a near a traffic artery are less developed,\u201d Van den Brandt said. \u201cThe urgency to do something in Brussels is gigantic.\u201d\n\nThe minister is also in discussions with Brussels\u2019 transit operator MIVB to make public transport free for those older than 65 and younger than 25.\n\nShe's got a good view of the problem \u2014 literally.\n\nHer office borders Brussels\u2019 north train station, a shabby area that houses a red-light district. But inside, on the 13th floor, Brussels lies at Van den Brandt\u2019s feet. Gigantic windows stretch across the wall facing her desk. They offer an excellent view of a city Van den Brandt intends to change.\n\nBrussels' government has plans for seven new tramlines and 30 percent more bus capacity. Van den Brandt has mixed feelings about a new metro line on which work has already started. The first part is expected to be ready by 2024 at the earliest, and the Green politician wants to move on faster transport solutions.\n\nShe has similar doubts about a proposal from rail infrastructure operator Infrabel for a tunnel to dislodge a bottleneck on the main rail link crossing the city. The scheme would cost \"a gigantic amount of money\" and have an enormous impact on the city, said Van den Brandt, who instead favors a solution that makes more use of the city's smaller stations. But she added, \"if works are necessary, works is what we'll do.\"\n\nShe aims to expand the capital's bike lane network by tackling missing links that currently make biking dangerous. \u201cA route is only safe if it\u2019s safe from beginning to end,\u201d she said.\n\nThose goals excite environmental campaigners. \"What remains exciting is how the capital will turn dreams into reality,\" said Bond Beter Leefmilieu, a group of green organizations, in July.\n\nEnd of the road\n\nThe minister is also in discussions with Brussels\u2019 transit operator MIVB to make public transport free for those older than 65 and younger than 25 \u2014 a measure to delay the purchase of a first car.\n\nThe idea has riled some regional MPs, who question what it means for MIVB's finances. \"We need efficient, qualitative public transport that can be a real alternative to the car,\" said Flemish nationalist MP Cieltje Van Achter earlier this month.\n\nIt's part of a bigger effort to make cars less attractive. Because of Belgium's sky-high taxes, many employers tend to give raises in the form of company cars \u2014 adding to the country's pollution and traffic problems.\n\nVan den Brandt wants to reorganize how streets are used. That means more space for public transport, for cyclists and for pedestrians \u2014 and less for cars. \u201cIf you give everyone a legitimate place, that will benefit car traffic as well,\" she argued. \"It\u2019s not cars versus bikes.\"\n\nThe polluted and congested Rue de la Loi, cutting through the EU district, is Van den Brandt\u2019s favorite example of where cars will have to give way. She wants to widen the sidewalks, where pedestrians currently have to share space with speeding bikes while cars get four lanes.\n\n\u201cThere are conflicts between pedestrians and bikes, which are linked to the fact that there\u2019s not enough space,\u201d she said.\n\nWith cars parked 95 percent of the time, redistributing space means tackling parking too \u2014 and the European institutions have a role to play, Van den Brandt said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we strike a deal with the European Commission to say, 'Also open up those parking spots to your neighbors?'\u201d\n\nAnother solution is to use technology.\n\nVan den Brandt caused a small frenzy when she said she\u2019d introduce a road-charging system in Brussels by the end of her term.\n\nTo get people to make more use of trains, trams, buses and shared bike and e-scooter systems, Van den Brandt wants a single app that bundles all operators and allows for single payments.\n\nThe region also wants to revamp traffic rules to create more one-way streets to make it hard to cross residential neighborhoods \u2014 a project started by the previous government. The idea is to make mapping apps less likely to send traffic through those areas.\n\nRoad politics\n\nVan den Brandt says the groundswell of public pressure is having an effect. There's more unity among Brussels' normally quarreling 19 municipalities \u2014 a structure that has been blamed for slow progress on transport issues, she said. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve reached a turning point.\"\n\nBut there are skeptical voices.\n\nBianca Debaets, former traffic safety secretary, said the coalition government's transport policies are weak on enforcement. \"That means municipalities can go back to blocking bike lanes, speed checks and 30 kilometer per hour zones,\" she wrote on her blog. \"There's no stick.\"\n\nThere are also frictions with Belgium\u2019s other regions. In August, Van den Brandt caused a small frenzy when she said she\u2019d introduce a road-charging system in Brussels by the end of her term \u2014 preferably with Flanders and Wallonia, but without them if they don't go along.\n\n\u201cBrussels is not an island,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by other regions, so we\u2019ll have to work together.\u201d\n\nThe Brussels scheme would see an existing flat annual car charge replaced with one linked to car use to discourage driving. \"The idea is that people who want to make a different choice are rewarded for that in some way,\" Van den Brandt said.\n\nThat's an easier sell in the capital, where only about half the people own cars and many are fed up with clogged streets. It's much more problematic in outlying regions with lots of commuters driving into Brussels.\n\n\"Unilaterally targeting car use, and especially commuters, is not the way forward,\" said Jan Van Doren, of the Flemish chamber of commerce.\n\nThe Flemish government binned its own rudimentary plans for a kilometer charge in the run-up to the May election, and the scheme hasn\u2019t made a reappearance in the newly formed government.\n\nFreshly minted Flemish Transport Minister Lydia Peeters said the idea was very unpopular in her own Limburg province, in the east of the country.\n\nBut Brussels\u2019 air pollution and congestion \u201cforce us to respond,\u201d Van den Brandt said. \u201cOtherwise cars\u2019 pressure on Brussels will continue to increase \u2014 and that\u2019s simply not tenable anymore.\"\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Mobility.
