News notes, they also share a friend in common \u2014 \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d star Tommy Dorfman, who\u2019s shared photos of both of Davidson and Gerber on his Instagram page in recent months.\n\nThe late-night star was previously romantically linked to \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d actor Margaret Qualley. The two took their romance overseas and stepped out together for the first time at the Venice Film Festival in August.\n\nQualley\u2019s mother, actress Andie McDowell, even commented on the budding romance, telling People magazine at the time, \u201cShe has a beautiful relationship with him but I don\u2019t want to step on her relationship too much. They have a nice relationship.\u201d\n\nDaniele Venturelli via Getty Images Anthony Mackie, Pete Davidson and Margaret Qualley attend the \"Seberg\" screening during the 76th Venice Film Festival.\n\nBut last week, reports claimed the two were on the outs after a few months of dating and still \u201cremain friends,\u201d according to an Us Weekly source.\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, however, Davidson, Gerber, and Qualley all seem to be in the same social circle, as Dorfman shared a photo of himself and the comedian earlier this month that was taken by Qualley.\n\nDavidson\u2019s love life became the stuff of headline news last year when he got engaged to pop star Ariana Grande. The two split in October 2018 after a whirlwind romance.\n\nAnd then there was his short-lived rebound fling with Kate Beckinsale in February, which he addressed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after they were seen making out at a hockey game in a viral photo that none of us will ever be able to unsee.", "description": "Davidson, 25, and Gerber, 18, were spotted grabbing a one-on-one meal together earlier this week.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db1f73a2100005f2534afad.png?cache=kxsf9fulwq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
