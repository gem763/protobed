One of them said hundreds of thousands of the coins had been minted already.\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said the UK will still produce a coin to mark its departure from the EU - whenever that takes place.\n\nJavid\u2019s predecessor, Philip Hammond, had also planned to mint a more limited number of the 50-pence coins to mark the original Brexit date of March 29.\\", "description": "Thousands of 50-pence coins minted to commemorate Brexit on October 31 will be melted down after Prime Minister Boris Johnson accepted an extension from the European Union, two people familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Jessica Shankleman", "Alex Morales"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4133/bd9548c8c146436e91edf45fe97615da.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
