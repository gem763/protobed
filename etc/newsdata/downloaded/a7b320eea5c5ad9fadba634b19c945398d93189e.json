I am not claiming to be a sangoma but I warned Mmusi Maimane that if he didn't stand on principle, his party's lapdogs would swallow him up and spit him out.\n\n\"He saw the blue train coming but didn't know how to get out of the way. The problem for Mmusi and his handlers in the DA is that none of them have a clue about principled leadership.\n\n\"The DA is well on its way on the path to destruction, and it's best we don't disturb them. South Africans who care about all our people must continue to come together for the common GOOD.\n\n\"To Mmusi I say: 'GOOD bye, I'm glad to see you go and hope you have a GOOD time',\" De Lille said.", "description": "Mmusi Maimane's words announcing that he was stepping down as DA leader were hardly cold when Patricia de Lille, who about a year ago made a similar decision, threw the first punch.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6723/a57a528a3846458a96b3efe3fbe67576.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
