Even in a regular year, there is an abundance of windfall apples littering urban parks, gardens and orchards, and they\u2019re ideal for making cider and/or vinegar. To get hold of some, find a local community orchard using the Orchard Network map on ptes.org, the People\u2019s Trust for Endangered Species website.\n\nApple cider vinegar is an elixir with many proven health benefits. Its popularity has made it expensive to buy, but it costs pennies to make. No exact quantity of ingredients is needed to make it \u2013 you can use whole apples cut into pieces, or just the skins and cores of unsprayed apples (save them up in the freezer until you\u2019ve collected enough) \u2013 once you\u2019ve got at least 200g apple pieces, you\u2019re good to go.\n\nDon't waste chicken fat - turn it into butter | Waste Not with Tom Hunt Read more\n\nRaw apple cider vinegar\n\nMaking your own vinegar is a rewarding endeavour: just a scrumping outing and a few minutes\u2019 work can produce enough to last you a year. If using the skin and core of apples, use organic or unsprayed ones to avoid fungicides and pesticides, which can otherwise become concentrated in the vinegar.\n\n200g or more apples, unsprayed or organic\n\n400ml water per 200g apples\n\n2 tsp sugar per 200g apples\n\n15ml raw cider vinegar per 500ml of total mixture\n\nFor every 200g apples, measure out 400ml water and two heaped teaspoons of sugar and stir until dissolved.\n\nPour over the fruit in a measuring jug (if the apples aren\u2019t covered, add more water), then calculate the total quantity in millimetres. Stir in 15ml raw cider vinegar per 500ml of vinegar mix, then pour into a sterilised jar.\n\nWeigh down the apples so they stay submerged, cover the jar with a clean cloth and store out of direct sunlight for three weeks, stirring each morning for the first four days. After three weeks, strain the mixture and the \u201cmother\u201d \u2013 the jelly-like substance which will have formed among the apples \u2013 into sterilised bottles, then seal and leave for another four weeks before using.", "description": "Windfall apples, cores and peelings needn\u2019t go to waste: apple cider vinegar is simple to make and super-healthy", "authors": ["Tom Hunt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4683d4b23d3b3d6924c5f9cc071f07d0dae74b48/0_0_4266_2560/master/4266.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f6b2610985ef727af034ca1dd2417856", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
