But it is more than backed up by the more than 400 pages of evidence that follow.\n\n\u201cFor all the power wielded today by the world\u2019s largest corporations,\u201d Dalrymple writes as he draws the volume to a close, \u201cthey are tame beasts compared with the ravaging territorial appetites of the militarized East India Company.\u201d\n\nIt is one of the ironies of a historian\u2019s lot\u2014at least when it comes time to publicize their work\u2014that journalists like me tend to be more interested in discussing the present than the past. But it is difficult to read The Anarchy, published in the United States on Sept. 10, without being struck by how timely it feels, how surprisingly of the moment. An epic of 576 pages in all, it serves as a reminder that early capitalism was just as perverse, predatory, and single-minded in its pursuit of profit as its much-derided late-model equivalent.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re aware of it or not, you\u2019re always writing history from the point of view of your time,\u201d Dalrymple told me by phone from the Scottish Highlands, shortly before his upcoming transatlantic book tour kicked off. \u201cThe whole issue of the power of the corporation is something we\u2019re reevaluating at the moment. The East India Company has actually become more topical even as I\u2019ve been writing.\u201d\n\n\u201c The story of the East India Company is the story of this odd dance between the power of the corporation and the power of the state. \u201d \u2014 William Dalrymple\n\nHe points to some of the more obvious ways in which this is the case: the East India Company\u2019s invention of corporate lobbying and its role in the world\u2019s first-ever lobbying scandal, its dubious status as the recipient of one of history\u2019s first government bail-outs.\n\n\u201cThe story of the East India Company is the story of this odd dance between the power of the corporation and the power of the state,\u201d Dalrymple says. \u201cBehind the story of the Company\u2019s conquest of India is this tussle between the two. Sometimes it looks as though the Company is winning\u2014bribing the state to alter the law, guarantee its monopolies, provide it with military assistance\u2014and at other times it seems as though the state is winning, which it ultimately does in 1858, when the Company is nationalized.\u201d\n\n\u201c The most obviously relevant moment is when the company goes bust in 1772 and has to borrow massive sums of money. It\u2019s the largest loan ever given to a British company up to that point. But they have to do it. The Company\u2019s responsible for half of all British trade by then. It really is too big to fail.\u201d\n\n\u201c What is interesting, though,\u201d Dalrymple says, \u201cis that, if you read Victorian histories of the Company, this bailout barely warrants a footnote. The big crashes of 10 years ago make it much more interesting to a historian today.\u201d\n\nThe aforementioned corporate violence seems troublingly familiar, too\u2014think Halliburton, Blackwater, the application of the shock doctrine\u2014though the book allows readers to make most of the connections themselves.\n\n\u201c I\u2019ve been reading more about ExxonMobil, for example, which does bring down governments and does have its own private army \u201d \u2014 William Dalrymple, speaking to The Daily Beast\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t go into the parallels much,\u201d Dalrymple admits. \u201cI just sketch them out at the beginning and the end. But as I\u2019ve been writing puff pieces in the lead-up to the book\u2019s release, editors have started asking for more contemporary stuff to float the history in.\n\n\u201cAs a result, I\u2019ve been reading more about ExxonMobil, for example, which does bring down governments and does have its own private army. Steve Coll [author of Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power] makes the similarities between the Company and ExxonMobil very explicit. I might have to add a new chapter to the paperback edition.\u201d\n\nTHE \u2018ALMOST ACCIDENTAL\u2019 EMPIRE\n\nThe Anarchy took Dalrymple six years to complete, longer than any of his previous books. On the one hand, this was because there were so many primary sources\u2014\u201cthe Company\u2019s own voluminous miles of records\u201d\u2014to pore over. \u201cThere\u2019s a very nice passage at the beginning of John Keay\u2019s history [The Honourable Company], where he imagines all these elderly professors attempting to write histories of the Company and dying at their desks in the library,\u201d Dalrymple says. \u201cThe Company kept everything in triplicate and all the archives survived.\u201d\n\nBut he also admits that the book simply \u201ctook forever to get right.\u201d Indeed, The Anarchy represents a kind of departure for Dalrymple, who describes his earlier books\u2014White Mughals, The Last Mughal, and Return of a King among them\u2014as \u201cmicro-histories.\u201d Each focuses on a small cast of characters over a tightly delineated, two- to five-year period.\n\n\u201c What I hadn\u2019t ever written before was kind of a big, sweeping macro-history, and I didn\u2019t know how to do it at all,\u201d he says. \u201cThe difficulty was working out what the narrative would be.\u201d\n\nFor all the colorful, conniving Company men who came to the sub-continent in the period Dalrymple covers\u2014namely, the years of Mughal decline, when \u201cthe once peaceful realm of India,\u201d as one scholar put it, \u201cbecame the abode of Anarchy\u201d\u2014it was ultimately an Indian who provided him with the through-line he needed.\n\n\u201cIt took forever to work out that the main character was actually [Moghul emperor] Shah Alam,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s there at the age of 16 when [Persian Emperor] Nader Shah rides into Delhi, when Delhi\u2019s still at its peak, and he\u2019s there as this broken, blind old man in his nineties at the end, when General [Gerard] Lake rides in [at the end of the Battle of Delhi].\u201d\n\nShah Alam is also there in 1765, in the wake of the Battle of Buxar, dismissing his revenue officials in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa and replacing them with Company men in an act of what Dalrymple describes as \u201cinvoluntarily privatization.\u201d \u201cBefore long,\u201d he writes, thanks to Indian loot, \u201cthe EIC was straddling the globe.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing preordained or inevitable about this outcome. Indeed, when the idea of the EIC was first floated at a 1599 meeting in London\u2014\u201cwhile William Shakespeare was pondering a draft of Hamlet in his house downriver from the Globe in Southwark,\u201d Dalrymple writes\u2014its success was far from guaranteed. Indeed, reading The Anarchy, one is constantly struck by how much had to go right for the Company (and wrong for the French, Marathas, Moghuls, and everyone else) for it to become the \u201cempire within an empire\u201d that it ultimately was.\n\n\u201cIt was almost accidental,\u201d Dalrymple tells me. \u201cThere was a very brief window of about 30 years between the 1750s and the 1780s when the Company found itself, uniquely in its history, with a massive military superiority. There was nothing in India, nothing in the Moghul armory, that could take on the new techniques of warfare developed by Frederick the Great on the fields of Flanders and Prussia and in wars like the War of Austrian Succession.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that only lasts until 1780. After that, it\u2019s much more a story about how Indian financiers see a greater advantage in keeping the Company in power than they do in supporting their own,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, the Company loots and plunders, it\u2019s dishonourable in a million different ways, it\u2019s underhanded and predatory and everything else. But it\u2019s also a commercial organization that understands the importance of repaying a loan, in full, with interest, on time. By 1803, these Indian bankers are actually competing with one another to back the Company\u2019s army.\u201d\n\nTHE MODI BOTS\n\nWhile this may seem a relatively uncontroversial point to readers in the West, it is the sort of thing\u2014with its suggestion of anti-national collaborationism\u2014that might prove otherwise in India\u2019s current political climate. Dalrymple is warmly known in India, where he keeps a home outside Delhi, as the \u201cWhite Moghul,\u201d and the country is by far the largest market for his work. But under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2014whose Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party considers the rewriting of Indian history along communal and ideological lines a priority\u2014that may one day cease to be the case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously very lucky in that people do read and like my stuff in India,\u201d Dalrymple says. \u201cBut there\u2019s also no question that there\u2019s a whole segment of society there that\u2019s deeply Islamophobic.\n\n\u201c India is certainly changing. You can see it just by going on Twitter. \u201d \u2014 William Dalrymple\n\n\u201c My books are obviously fairly sympathetic to the Moghuls and embrace the old Nehruvian idea of India as a diverse, rather than specifically Hindu, country. It\u2019s impossible to say whether, in the longer term, given my positive views on Indo-Islamic culture, whether a new generation will grow up not wanting to read my books or listen to their message. India is certainly changing. You can see it just by going on Twitter.\u201d\n\nDalrymple has an impressive 1.2 million followers on the social media platform. But he\u2019s quick to disabuse me of the notion that anywhere near that number of them are real.\n\n\u201c About two years ago, something very weird began to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cI went from about 100,000 followers to more than a million in a matter of months. I went about preening myself and thinking what I fine fellow I was before my sister-in-law pointed out to me that most of my new followers were BJP bots. I\u2019d somehow wound up on a list of influencers and been followed by hundreds of thousands of government bots and trolls.\u201d\n\n\u201c They sleep until you use words like \u2018Modi\u2019 or \u2018BJP\u2019 or \u2018RSS\u2019\u2014or \u2018Kashmir,\u2019 obviously, more recently\u2014and the abuse they tweet at people can be shocking.\u201d\n\nThat Dalrymple\u2019s Twitter feed should inspire the ire of India\u2019s nationalists is ultimately pretty mind-boggling. His tweets are mostly dedicated to his love of the sub-continent\u2019s art and architecture. The Anarchy is littered with passages about painting, music, and other cultural production. \u201cOne by one, my children identified those passages as self-indulgent and excessive,\u201d he laughs, \u201cwhich is saying something given that they\u2019ve all been cut down from much longer versions.\u201d He has also written the catalogue for a new exhibition, Forgotten Masters: Indian Painting for the East India Company 1770-1857, which opens at London\u2019s Wallace Collection in December. He says India\u2019s relationship to its heritage also troubles him greatly.\n\n\u201cOne of the big problems in India is that there\u2019s no heritage listings for vernacular buildings,\u201d he says. \u201cIn London, I\u2019m not even allowed to alter the interior of my 18th Century house. In India, I can\u2019t bulldoze the Red Fort or any heritage-listed monument, but I could destroy my 18th Century haveli [townhouse] tomorrow and build a concrete car park without breaking the law.\n\n\u201c There\u2019s been a mad embrace of modernity and a correspondingly massive destruction of the past. \u201d \u2014 William Dalrymple\n\n\u201c India is changing in that way, too. There\u2019s a lot more destruction of history than you see elsewhere, especially in cities like Hyderabad, where there\u2019s been a mad embrace of modernity and a correspondingly massive destruction of the past.\u201d\n\nBut Dalrymple doesn\u2019t believe that India has reached the point of no return, or that the changes to Indian politics and society that Modi represents, or has enabled, are necessarily permanent. \u201cThe world is certainly on a rightward-swing, but it will\u2014it must\u2014swing back,\u201d he says. As far as the country\u2019s contested, increasingly politicised history is concerned, he points to a number of younger historians who are ignoring the dictates of the nationalist moment and continuing to approach the past with the rigour it deserves. He singles out Manu Pillai (Rebel Sultans: The Deccan from Khilji to Shivaji) and Parvati Sharma (Jahangir: An Intimate Portrait of a Great Mughal) for special praise.\n\n\u201c You do get a dichotomy in India between popular historians who don\u2019t do any research and academic historians whose research is impeccable but who remain bogged down in a kind of post-colonial, PoMoPoCo language, which is hard to read and hard to understand,\u201d he says. \u201c Pillai and Sharma are the kind of historians who have the ability to absorb huge amounts of material as well as write beautiful prose.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a standard to which Dalrymple has always tried to hold himself.\n\n\u201c My favourite historian has always been the medievalist and Byzantinist Steven Runciman,\u201d he says. \u201cHe wrote what is still my favorite history book of all time, The Fall of Constantinople 1453. He did all the research. He read the primary sources. He also wrote like a dream. He was a beautiful prose stylist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was writing my first book, White Mughals, I very much had Runciman on my bedside as a model for how to do these things,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat he taught me was that you can research as thoroughly as any academic historian and write as beautifully as any literary novelist at the same time. It can be done. It has been done. All I did was take that style\u2014that mixture\u2014and apply it to India.\u201d", "description": "The writer of penetrating histories of India and Afghanistan explains how his new book touches on such modern themes as the non-stop waltz between corporations and government.", "authors": ["Matthew Clayfield"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_2998,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567964519/190908-clayfield-east-india-company-hero_upg3r3", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
