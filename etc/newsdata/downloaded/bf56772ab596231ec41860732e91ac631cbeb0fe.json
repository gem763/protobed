Now, some 175 years later, Delille is poised to become not only New Orleans\u2019 first official saint, but also the first U.S.-born black saint.\n\nDelille\u2019s story is inspiring. She was born in 1812 and, as a young Creole woman, she lived with a white man in a common-law marriage permitted under the system of \u201cplacage\u201d (an extra-legal system that circumvented the laws preventing interracial marriage). When she was 24, after the death of two young sons, she experienced a religious conversion of sorts that led her to found the Sisters of the Holy Order. Her focus was tending to the elderly, caring for the sick, and teaching slaves and free blacks whose access to education opportunities was severely limited. She was known for conducting itinerant catechism classes on the banks of the Mississippi. And all of this took place during a period in Louisiana history when taking any actions that might \u201cdisturb\u201d the population (for instance, by educating them) was considered criminal behavior.\n\nAs Virginia Gould and Charles Nolan, editors of No Cross, No Crown: Black Nuns in Nineteenth Century New Orleans note, \"That a small band of Afro-Creole women founded a religious community in the antebellum South was remarkable\u2026 Conventions of class, race, gender, and condition held implications for free women of color in New Orleans as they did nowhere else in the Deep South.\u201d Delille\u2019s work, in other words, is remarkable.", "description": "After centuries of whitewashing saints, the Catholic Church may be on the cusp of naming America\u2019s first black saints.", "authors": ["Candida Moss"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1491839545/articles/2017/04/02/america-s-first-black-saints/170402-moss-henriette-delille-tease-1_vhkpyc", "published_at": "2017-04-02"}
