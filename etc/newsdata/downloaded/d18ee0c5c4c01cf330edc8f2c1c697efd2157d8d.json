It may be seen as \u2014 and treated as \u2014 an inflection point for the company, and subsequently for AAPL stock.\n\nApple Stock Stuck in Limbo Until After Tuesday's Event More\n\nSource: mama_mia / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe make-or-break matter? The iPhone, or perhaps more specifically, the likelihood that other innovations can offset the slowdown the iPhone is facing.\n\nThe company and its flagship product still has a large base of fans, of course, professional and amateur alike. After all, it\u2019s Apple. This is the company that mainstreamed the use of smartphones.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat optimism may still not be enough to alter reality though. Tuesday\u2019s presentation will likely, finally jolt investors into making a bigger-picture decision that in turn shoves Apple stock into a longer-lived trend.\n\nMixed Messages for AAPL Stock\n\nThere\u2019s a twist to the story most of Apple\u2019s die-hard fans don\u2019t want to acknowledge. That is, consumers are losing interest in the iPhone. They have been since 2012. Sales of the device, as measured by units, peaked in 2017. iPhone revenue peaked last year.\n\nIt\u2019s got nothing to do with an ability to make each iteration a little better than the prior version. Apple can still make big enough technological leaps to justify a new entry every year. The market is simply saturated with \u2018good enough\u2019 phones remaining in use for longer timeframes, particularly now that the average sticker price for most iPhone models has pushed past $1000.\n\nCompeting high-end handhelds from the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) are contributing to the headwind.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly not the party line the most loyal of fans has plugged into in front of media event. Rather, their rhetoric has mostly renewed cheers for the positive impact of the iPhone.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives is one of those optimists. He believes \u201cApple\u2019s supply chain is planning on 75 million units for the initial iPhone 11 launch period, which is a slight uptick vs. its prior iPhone cycle last fall.\u201d Ives specifically touted \u201cpent-up installed base demand\u201d from owners ready for an upgrade.\n\nBy and large though, most analysts recognize the future is about everything else Apple is now doing. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino went as far as to call the new iPhone lineup (given what\u2019s already known about them) \u201cboring.\u201d Zino\u2019s is still interested in the event though, anticipating announcements regarding the company\u2019s television and video-gaming ambitions.\n\nAn Unfamiliar Business Model\n\nIt\u2019s a microcosm of the overarching headache investors are suffering.\n\nMost observers understand the iPhone is an increasingly smaller piece of the company\u2019s revenue mix, and that digital services is making up an increasingly larger portion of it. Dana Blankenhorn voiced it well last week, writing:\n\n\u201cUnder Tim Cook Apple has learned to squeeze increasing amounts of lifetime revenue from each Apple customer, thanks to its services, which are phenomenally profitable. Getting customers in the door is thus more important than making money off the initial sale.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s proving tough to handicap about the new business model is the pace of the transition, and whether or not the iPhone\u2019s revenue can ever fully be \u2018replaced\u2019 by services.\n\nOn that matter Blankenhorn adds:\n\n\u201cAnalysts should be focused on the average revenue per user of Apple\u2019s user base, not the bright, shiny objects executives hold up next Tuesday.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s presentation won\u2019t answer all questions about the pace of the business model\u2019s shift or the monetization of Apple product owners. At best, it might lead the masses to a more educated guess.\n\nStill, more convinced they\u2019ve got a better grip on what\u2019s to come, traders as a group are more likely to make a buy or sell decision that jump-starts a longer-lived trend.", "description": "For some it's just the usual September show-and-tell event Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been hosting for years.
