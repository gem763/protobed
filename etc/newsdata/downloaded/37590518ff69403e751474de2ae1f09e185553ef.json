Experts are asking why a lifesaving treatment isn't widely available without a prescription.", "language": "en", "text": "An opioid overdose kills 130 Americans each day, on average. So why isn't the opioid overdose antidote naloxone, which is a prescription medication, as widely available as over-the-counter products like Advil and Plan B?\n\nThat's a question experts have been asking for years, and they're asking it again now that the US Food and Drug Administration recently highlighted its work to make naloxone more accessible.\n\nThe FDA, which regulates medications and other products, has been working to encourage companies to make an over-the-counter naloxone product. Such a treatment would be \"an important public health advancement,\" FDA Acting Commissioner Dr. Ned Sharpless said in a Friday statement.\n\nBut experts have also called on the FDA itself make current naloxone products available without a prescription. One of those experts is Corey Davis, a staff attorney at the National Health Law Program, and he redoubled the call this weekend:\n\nMeanwhile, addiction medicine specialist Dr. Stefan Kertesz wrote:\n\nThe US has long been in the throes of a deadly opioid crisis, with overdose deaths from prescription painkillers as well as heroin and synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\n\nUS Surgeon General Jerome Adams has advised Americans who know people at risk of an overdose to carry naloxone, and said that the rescue medication is a crucial tool, since such overdoses typically happen outside of a medical setting like a hospital.\n\nYou should be able to buy naloxone without a prescription, but that doesn't always work out in practice\n\nBecause naloxone is so widely recognized as a lifesaving product, many states have taken steps to make it more available.\n\nIn most places, you should be able to go to the pharmacy and get naloxone under what's called a \"standing order,\" which works like a blanket prescription for people in that state or area. Certain states also give pharmacists power to prescribe or sell naloxone, the FDA's Sharpless noted. But he also acknowledged the limitations.\n\n\"Still, many pharmacists may be unaware of the standing orders and direct authority in their states or are unwilling to provide all forms of naloxone to consumers without an individual prescription,\" Sharpless wrote in the Friday statement.\n\nA New York Times investigation last year found that, of 720 New York City pharmacies that were supposed to sell naloxone without a prescription, only about a third had it in stock and would sell it without a prescription.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of price. Naloxone can cost up to $150 without insurance, Business Insider has previously reported, though insurance plans may cap the out-of-pocket costs at around $20. A generic version of the naloxone nasal spray Narcan was approved by the FDA earlier this year, which could help bring down the cost of the medication.", "description": "The antidote, naloxone, is supposed to be readily available at pharmacies in most states.
