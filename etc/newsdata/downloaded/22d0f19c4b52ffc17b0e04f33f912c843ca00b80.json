Masahiro Tanaka began the opener for the Yankees and James Paxton was on the mound for Game 2.\n\nNeither team had a starting pitcher it wanted to use for Game 4 on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cJ.A. Happ could very much be in the mix, as well as I picture our bullpen being unleashed on that day,\u201d New York manager Aaron Boone said Monday as the series shifted to Yankee Stadium.\n\nA starter during the regular season, Happ has relieved during the playoffs. The 36-year-old left-hander entered in the 10th inning of Game 2, escaped a two-out jam, then allowed Carlos Correa\u2019s home run leading off the 11th that gave the Astros a 3-2 win.\n\nHouston manager A.J. Hinch started Zack Greinke in the opener followed by Justin Verlander in Game 2. Hinch anticipates rookie right-hander Jos\u00e9 Urquidy will pitch at some point in Game 4 but preferred to call it \u201ca bullpen day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the cool thing to say nowadays,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cMaybe Urquidy starts, maybe he comes in the middle of the game. And we go with somebody with a little bit more experience. But we haven\u2019t made that decision. We don\u2019t even know if we\u2019re going to play that day. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about the weather.\u201d\n\nHeavy rain is forecast for Wednesday, and if Game 4 is postponed, Tanaka and Grienke would start Thursday on normal rest.\n\nBoone removed Paxton after 2 1/3 innings and 51 pitches, and the bullpen allowed two runs and three hits in 7 2/3 innings. George Springer hit a tying home run in the fifth on Adam Ottavino\u2019s first pitch.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s as far off maybe as is being talked, but he\u2019s certainly not as sharp as he\u2019s been most of the year,\u201d Boone said of Ottavino. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s close to being that, and I think some small successes hopefully will spur him on because he needs to play a big role for us.\u201d\n\nSTANTON\n\nBoone said a decision won\u2019t be made until Tuesday on outfielder Giancarlo Stanton, who strained his right quadriceps in the opener and missed Game 2.\n\nLimited by injuries to 18 games during the regular season, Stanton homered in the opener. If he were dropped from the roster against the Astros, he would be ineligible to return this year.\n\n\u201cIt is a sensitive decision, a tough decision,\u201d Boone said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just try and evaluate and try and get as honest as feedback as we can from Giancarlo.\u201d\n\nAaron Hicks could get his first start since Aug. 3, taking over in center field from Brett Gardner, who would replace Stanton in left. Sidelined by an injured flexor near his right elbow, Hicks pinch-hit for starting left fielder Cameron Maybin and grounded out leading off the 10th inning in Game 2, then moved to center.\n\n\u201cAaron is very much in play,\u201d Boone said, \u201cThought he had a good at-bat, looked like Aaron Hicks. So he\u2019ll very much be part of the conversation moving forward.\u201d\n\nSEVERINO\n\nAfter missing most of the season with a lat injury sustained while warming up for his first spring training start, Severino returned for three outings in late September, then wiggled out of trouble to pitch four scoreless innings in Game 3 against Minnesota.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to go out there and strike out 15 people. I just need to go out there and throw a good game,\u201d Severino said,\n\nSHADOWS\n\nWhile Tuesday\u2019s game is scheduled to start shortly after 4 p.m., it is late enough in the year that the mound should be covered in shadows in addition to home plate.\n\nBACK IN THE BRONX\n\n\u201cI always like our chances going home, especially for three,\u201d Yankees slugger Aaron Judge said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to roll. It\u2019s the postseason. We\u2019re going to get it done.\u201d\n\nNew York players count on the ability of Yankees fans to rattle opponents.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be just as jacked up as we are,\u201d reliever Tommy Kahnle said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Yankees and Astros plan all-bullpen games from the start in Game 4 of the AL Championship Series in a sign of the times.
