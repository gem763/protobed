In Sugar Rumble, It's India Versus the Rest of World's Producers\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Sugar prices have slumped to the lowest in 11 months, defying forecasts for a shift in the global market to a deficit from a surplus. India, which often is a swing producer, again takes the spotlight as rivals lambaste the Asian nation\u2019s export subsidies.\n\nThe Indian government\u2019s policies on subsidies and export quotas spurred a challenge from other producers at the World Trade Organization. The escalating rift is said to be on Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s agenda for a visit to India in November, the International Sugar Organization said in a report.\n\nThe dispute also is on the schedule for traders and investors at the S&P Global Platts sixth annual conference starting Sunday in Miami. Raw-sugar futures are down 8.4% to 11.02 cents a pound in 2019, heading for a third straight annual drop. Bullish sentiment has been eroded by a raft of exports from India that Brazil, the top producer, calls \u201cunsustainable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of worry for the market,\u201d Michael McDougall, managing director at Paragon Global Markets in New York, said in a telephone interview. Sugar has been weak for two years, \u201cwhich in general is not good for anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nSmaller producers such as Guatemala and El Salvador \u201cwill continue to suffer,\u201d partly because of currency volatility, said McDougall, who will attend the Platts conference.\n\nCitigroup Inc (NYSE: ). called India\u2019s policy \u201ca blow\u201d for bulls. While the country\u2019s domestic prices remain strong, putting a viable export level around 13 cents, \u201chefty stocks and slowing domestic consumption growth\u201d may cut margins and spur cheaper offers for exports, Aakash Doshi, a bank analyst, said in a report this week.\n\nLast month, Citigroup (NYSE: ) forecast a global balance swing to a \u201cbullish\u201d supply deficit of 7.2 million tons in the 12 months starting Oct. 1, compared with a surplus this season. India, may produce 28 million tons, down 15%.\n\nSugar Glut Keeps Growing as India Exports Spark Bearish Bets\n\nTurmoil in currency markets, prospects for slowing global sugar demand and the U.S.-China trade war will be hot topics in Miami, where more than 150 traders and executives are expected.\n\nBrazil\u2019s real and India\u2019s rupee have weakened against the dollar, boosting the appeal of exports priced in greenback. World sweetener consumption is expected to increase 1.3% next year, below historic trends, the London-based International Sugar Organization projects.\n\nProducers may get a boost by a global shift toward cane-based ethanol and increasing demand in emerging markets. Greater use of cane juice for biofuel in India, Brazil and possibly China may reduce inventory, Bruno Lima, an INTL FCStone analyst in Sao Paulo, said in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cEthanol could be the saving grace for the sugar market,\u201d Nick Gentile, managing partner at NickJen Capital Management in New York, said in a telephone interview.\n\nA trade deal between Beijing and Washington may spark a rally, though \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone believes we are going to have a resolution until after the election,\u201d Gentile said. \u201cNo one believes either side at this point.\u201d\n\nIn a Sept. 5 report, the ISO said, \u201cThe fundamentals provide some grounds for cautious optimism\u201d mainly because \u201cthe surplus phase seems over.\u201d Inventories \u201care still overhanging the market and need to be absorbed before prices can return to more remunerative levels for producers,\u201d the group said.\n\nIn India, exports can be unpredictable. Mills planned to ship 5 million tons in 2018-19, and the volume stood at 3.8 million at the end of August.\n\n\u201cThe Indian sugar is there, but it\u2019s actually not coming to the market,\u201d FCStone\u2019s Lima said. \u201cYou have to wait and see.\u201d", "description": "In Sugar Rumble, It's India Versus the Rest of World's Producers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB7Q0U9_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
