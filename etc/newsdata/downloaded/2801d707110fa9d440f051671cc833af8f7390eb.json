When sadness strikes, simply imagining it as a person can make the emotion feel less intense, a recent study has found.\n\nThe authors were inspired by the movie \"Inside Out,\" Pixar's 2015 animated hit that showed five bickering emotions \u2014 Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness \u2014 coming to life inside a girl\u2019s head. Sadness had blue skin, blue hair, a slumped posture and an alarming urge to cry in most any situation.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology, began with an experiment that asked 114 participants to think about a time when they felt very sad, such as after the death of a loved one. Researchers then randomly assigned half of them to write down what kind of person their sadness would be like if it came to life \u2014 or \u201cwho\u201d it was. The other half was asked to write about \u201cwhat\u201d it was, or how it affected their state of mind.\n\nAfter the exercise, all of the participants rated how much sadness they felt at that moment on a scale of one to seven. The results showed those who thought about their sorrow as a person reported feeling less intensely sad than the other participants.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

When asked to choose between a theoretical salad or cheesecake, for example, they were more likely to pick the healthier option than the other participants.\n\nPrevious research has shown sadness usually leads people to \u201cfocus on the short term and a desire for urgent reward.\"\n\nThe findings made sense to Jason Moser, an associate professor of psychology at Michigan State University, who found people who talk to themselves in the third person, using their own first names or he/she/they, can also soothe their anxiety.\n\n\u201cIt gives us this distance, it gives us this perspective as though we\u2019re looking at either someone else or something else,\u201d Moser, who was not involved in the new study, told TODAY.\n\n\u201cYou take control over it,\" he said, \"(and) it enables you to see what\u2019s going on, to feel like it\u2019s not happening to you, to think about it differently.\u201d\n\nHowever, although distancing techniques may be helpful for generally healthy people who feel some sadness, it\u2019s not clear how well they would work for people diagnosed with depression, Moser cautioned.\n\nFor happiness, it may be best not to imagine it as a person. The new study showed people who applied the detachment technique to their feelings of joy felt less content.\n\n\"It's probably not wise to apply this strategy for positive emotions because we do not want to minimize these good feelings,\" Yang said.", "description": "When sadness strikes, simply imagining it as a person can make the emotion feel less intense, a recent study has found.", "authors": ["A.
