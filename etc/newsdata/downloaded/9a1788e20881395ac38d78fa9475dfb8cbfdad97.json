Please help us by supporting our independent journalism\n\nThe All Blacks have had a pack of Japanese journalists following them around this World Cup. They are the only team who have hired a full-time go-between to translate every last question and answer, which says plenty about their attention to detail and just as much about their desire to crack the Japan market. There is a five-minute slot set aside for their questions at the end of every press conference, and over the weeks, there has been one that has come up over and again. It\u2019s the same question we all ask at one time or another, the one Eddie Jones is convinced he knows the answer to: \u201cWhat makes you so good?\u201d\n\nThis week it was Scott Barrett\u2019s turn to field it. Barrett is not a bad man to ask, because whatever they were doing down on the little dairy farm in Taranaki where he, Beauden, and Jordie grew up, it clearly worked. He said it was to do with the ball skills they learned playing different sports \u2013 \u201ccricket, basketball, athletics, hockey\u201d \u2013 but I prefer his father Kevin\u2019s answer: \u201cIt must be something in the milk.\u201d Turns out you really can bottle it. The only surprise is the NZRU has not started flogging it. It was only last week that one of its regional partners, Mitsubishi, announced the launch of a limited-edition range of All Blacks themed SUVs.\n\nThe big kick-off: England playmakers hold the key to beating New Zealand | Ugo Monye Read more\n\nThe Barrett boys have been bunking down together this week. Scott and Beauden, who are both in the starting XV, have been roommates for the first time since they shared the farm\u2019s four-bed dorm in 2002. \u201cScott\u2019s clearly got his rugby head on,\u201d Beauden says, \u201cbecause the other night he was calling out lineout moves in his sleep.\u201d They don\u2019t seem to agree which of them used to get the top bunk back home, except that it definitely wasn\u2019t little brother Jordie, who is on the bench this weekend.\n\nThe change of rooms is not the only switch Scott has made lately. He is starting at blindside flanker for the first time, too. He usually does most of his training with the locks, but this week he has been a full-time member of the back row. The All Blacks\u2019 management are clearly thinking of that game at Twickenham last November, when England were five points up at half-time. Scott came on in the 50th minute and did such a number on England\u2019s lineout that they lost five of their next 10 throws. New Zealand ended up winning 16-15.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite nice to be rooming with him,\u201d Scott said, \u201cand to chat about stuff to prepare for this game.\u201d It\u2019s a shrewd move by the management, and clever, too, to stick him in with his big brother before the biggest game of his life. They have got a good understanding of the brothers\u2019 family dynamics, which the hooker, Dane Coles, explains this way: \u201cJordie is a psycho, because he\u2019s been bullied by Scott. So when we play darts in the team room, Jordie loses his guts when he throws one bad dart. Then Scott\u2019s the one who\u2019s nice and calm, and Baz is in-between. He loses it now and again but he does have that calm karma about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re all pretty competitive,\u201d Beauden admits. \u201cBut you\u2019d probably find more rivalry on the lawn at home in the summertime playing backyard cricket than you would in camp. We all play in different positions so it\u2019s hard to compare.\u201d Jordie might not quite agree with that. He played No 15 in his first seven Tests, but now Beauden has moved back there he has been squeezed on to the wing or been busy filling in at fly-half. It can\u2019t be easy competing with your big brother for a spot in the team, especially when he is the best player in the world.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beauden Barrett (near) and his brother Jordi talk to the media ahead of the semi-final.

The boys posed for a photo with him after the quarter-final against Ireland, which he watched from the stands. It has not been an easy few weeks. His father, Ted, died recently, and the boys had to decide whether or not they ought to go back for the funeral. They stayed, and after it was over he flew over to join them. \u201cLast week was a tough week for Dad and for ourselves, so it was awesome to share that moment with him,\u201d Beauden said. \u201cIt was obviously a tough time. The team were awesome around supporting us and always giving us the option to head home if that\u2019s what we needed to do.\u201d\n\nThe trouble is, Jordie says, that now Kevin\u2019s here he wants to tell them what to do. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll try to add his 10 cents in the next couple of days.\u201d Kevin played flanker himself, for Taranaki and the Hurricanes, so Scott has got the worst of it. \u201cAs long as he doesn\u2019t follow some of dad\u2019s tactics from \u201998. You probably can\u2019t get away with it now.\u201d\n\nTruth is, Kevin taught them all he knows a long time ago. When I went to visit the farm back in 2015, he explained that he thinks the big reason why his kids succeeded is that he made them drill the same basic set of skills when they were young, \u201cHow to kick with both feet, pass both ways, and run with the ball in both hands\u201d.\n\nQuick guide New Zealand team to face England in World Cup semi-final Show Hide New Zealand B Barrett; S Reece, J Goodhue, A Lienert-Brown, G Bridge;\n\nR Mo\u2019unga, A Smith; J Moody, C Taylor, N Laulala, B Retallick,\n\nS Whitelock, S Barrett, A Savea, K Read.\n\nReplacements D Coles, O Tuungafasi, A Ta\u2019avao, P Tuipulotu, S Cane,\n\nTJ Perenara, S Williams, J Barrett.\n\nBack then, Beauden was still trying to nail down a spot in the All Blacks\u2019 starting XV, Scott had just joined the Crusaders, and Jordie was in his first year at Lincoln University. There are two other brothers as well. Kane, the oldest of the lot, who was playing No 8 for the Auckland Blues until he had to retire because of concussion, and Blake, who is back playing for the local Coastal rugby club. And three sisters too, Jenna, who plays netball for Taranaki, Ella, and Zara, who has Down\u2019s syndrome.\n\nBeauden, Jordie, and Scott spoke publicly about that for the first time this year, to help raise awareness of the charity UpsideDowns, which provides funding for speech-therapy services for children with Down\u2019s syndrome. \u201cIf people could just treat those with Down\u2019s syndrome equally, that\u2019s all I\u2019d ask,\u201d said Beauden. Their parents treated all eight of them exactly the same, he explained. And that goes back to the most important lesson they learned down on the farm, the one that will serve them long after this match has come and gone.\n\n\u201cYou have got to realise that rugby is just a game, so enjoy it while you are there,\u201d Kevin told me back then. \u201cIt\u2019s special, you put a jersey on and play for your province, or get picked for your country and pull on the All Black jersey, that\u2019s a huge honour. But always remember who you are and where you came from, and always keep your feet on the ground. Because the day you take your jersey off you\u2019re just one of us.\u201d You never met a humbler bunch of superstars. Like Coles says: \u201cThey\u2019re good people, and they come from a great family.\u201d", "description": "Scott, Beauden and Jordie Barrett will all feature against England on Saturday \u2013 whatever they were doing down on the Barrett family little dairy farm in Taranaki it clearly worked", "authors": ["Andy Bull"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3053f2f4b6a0234d38f486453ecae510e739c719/310_249_2668_1601/master/2668.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8a8127033b79d99522265af96dace0e", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
