The result is clear: the allegations are groundless,\u201d Hiltrud Dorothea Werner, Volkswagen\u2019s board member in charge of integrity and legal affairs, said in a statement emailed to The Washington Post. \u201cVolkswagen AG therefore remains confident that it has fulfilled all its reporting obligations under capital markets law. If there is a trial, we are confident that the allegations will prove to be unfounded. Furthermore, the presumption of innocence applies until proven otherwise.\u201d\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s Executive Committee of the Supervisory Board had considered the possibility of such charges and will meet immediately \u201cto discuss next steps in light of the indictments,\u201d a spokesman for the board said in a statement emailed to The Post. The auto giant\u2019s shares were down more than 1.6 percent in midday trading.\n\nIn September 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency discovered Volkswagen had for years rigged millions of diesel cars with cheat devices that allowed them to test as low emission, when in fact their output was 40 times the legal U.S. limit. Winterkorn resigned shortly after the scandal became public.\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s shares shed as much as 37 percent of their value after the scandal broke, and the company has been weighed down with legal trouble ever since. In June 2016, Volkswagen paid $14.7 billion to settle shareholder claims tied to the scandal, in one of the biggest class-action settlements in U.S. history. In January 2017, Volkswagen paid $4.3 billion in criminal and civil fines after pleading guilty in a case brought by the U.S. Justice Department. It was the first time the company had pleaded guilty to criminal conduct in court.\n\nIn May, Volkswagen\u2019s chief financial officer revealed that the scandal had cost the company 30 billion euros ($33 billion). He also said another 1 billion euros had been set aside for ongoing legal costs.\n\nVolkswagen and Winterkorn also face a civil suit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for raising more than $13 billion from investors in the bonds and securities markets between April 2014 and May 2015, while senior executives covered up the emissions scheme. Volkswagen contends the lawsuit is \u201clegally and factually flawed\u201d and accused the SEC of \u201cpiling on\u201d years after the company assumed culpability.", "description": "The emissions scandal has cost Volkswagen $33 billion euros since it broke in 2015.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WN4JQKW6XII6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
