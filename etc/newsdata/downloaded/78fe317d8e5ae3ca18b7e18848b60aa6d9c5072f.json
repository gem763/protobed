The Mail said that she could have been killed as well, but for her decision to quickly wash the substance off her hands.\n\nThey were later charged with Kim's murder. But the charges against them were abruptly dropped earlier this year, before either of them gave evidence. Both women were allowed to return home.\n\nIn her Mail on Sunday interview, Siti described two \"producers\" training her with the baby oil smearing prank, paying as much as $120 (R1,800) a time, vastly more than she could earn in her regular job as a masseuse.\n\nShe said: \"I was nervous about doing the pranks at first in case someone reacted badly or hit out but I was very happy to have the work.\n\n\"I questioned why anyone would want to watch this sort of thing but they told me Japanese audiences loved it.\"\n\nHer last \"prank\" went differently, she said. This time she had a specific target and another woman, Huong, also trying to carry out the smear.\n\nIn the end, Huong reached Kim before Siti, and she did not end up touching him, though both had the poison ready to use.\n\nAccording to the Mail's account, the women's handlers had little concern for the harm which the agent could do to them.\n\nSiti said that Huong ended up smearing Kim's face just before she could reach him. Parry, the Mail reporter, wrote:\n\n\"Siti and Huong fled in different directions after the attack and both went straight to different washrooms to clean the sticky liquid off their hands - an act that would almost certainly save their lives.\"\n\nMuch of the Kim Jong Nam story remains unresolved, as Business Insider's Alexandra Ma wrote in April this year when the murder trial ended.\n\nMa wrote that the decision to end the trial was never fully explained, but came after Malaysia was lobbied by Vietnam and Indonesia.\n\nMalaysia named four North Korean men who are wanted over the assassination, but they have never been found.", "description": "Siti Aisyah, who lives in rural Indonesia, described being tricked into one of history's strangest assassinations, which could have left her dead too.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8572/7159086ad99e493098e50a6e39cee2a2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
