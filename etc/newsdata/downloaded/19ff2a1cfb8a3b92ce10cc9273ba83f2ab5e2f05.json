When it came time to question Joe Biden, Cooper made it clear that Biden had been falsely accused by President Trump and there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden or his father.\n\nLindsey Graham was not impressed.\n\nWhat a \u201cHARD-HITTING\u201d takedown on the Hunter Biden scandal by @CNN. Can only imagine if the shoe was on the other foot and this was @VP Pence's son. What a joke. #DemDebates \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 16, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s video:\n\nCNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper runs interference for the Democrats, claims that Trump \u201cfalsely\u201d accused Biden of corruption Biden responds by lying, falsely claims that he never talk to his son about business. Even his son said that he did. pic.twitter.com/jxeVoHTSIU \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 16, 2019\n\nCNN moderators note there is \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing\u201d (sure ok) by Hunter Biden, which clearly isn\u2019t the same standard for the impeachment pitchfork party. \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) October 16, 2019\n\n\"I never discussed a single thing about anything having to do with Ukraine. And no one says that I did.\" \u2014Joe Biden at the #DemocraticDebate \u201cDad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing [joining Burisma],\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do.\u2019 \u201d\u2014Hunter Biden to the New Yorker, 7/8/19 \u2014 Michael Knowles (@michaeljknowles) October 16, 2019\n\nDid you catch that Anderson Cooper in his question about Hunter Biden said that Trump \u201cfalsely accused\u201d Biden. \u2014 askme (@askme43286689) October 16, 2019\n\n\"Your son is falsely accused of wrongdoing\", says Anderson Cooper to Joe Biden. He got 50k a month to do a job in Ukraine he knew nothing about because his father was vice president, that's criminally suspect Anderson. \u2014 Eva \ud83d\udc7b (@EvaBronn) October 16, 2019\n\nJoe Biden: \u201cNo one has indicated\u201d that I discussed Ukraine with my son. Except Hunter told the New Yorker they did, with Joe warning him: \u201cI hope you know what you are doing.\u201d Who\u2019s lying? #DemDebate \u2014 Michael Ahrens (@michael_ahrens) October 16, 2019\n\nJoe Biden lied just now during the debate.

After Anderson Coopers extensive investigation into Biden/Ukraine \u2013 it\u2019s been declared false. We should all thank Anderson Cooper and CNN for their thorough work and investigations \u2014 Extremely Stable Genius (@FiatJustitia_) October 16, 2019\n\nAnderson Cooper just made the statement to Joe Biden that President Trump falsely accused Hunter Biden of wrong doing. How does Anderson Cooper know it\u2019s false. Answer: (HE DOESN\u2019T) It just shows the blatant bias in this CLOWN debate! \u2014 USCG Proud (@uscg_proud) October 16, 2019\n\nI love that Anderson Cooper says Trump falsely accused Hunter Biden instead of accused, what a tip off of extreme bias. \u2014 Randy Treibel (@therealrainfall) October 16, 2019\n\n@cnn @andersoncooper both suck. Cooper just said \u201cTrump falsely accused Hunter Biden\u2026\u201d. Where did he get that confirmation that this was a false accusation? The bias of a failing network. \u2014 Ocho Fox (@thewhit70) October 16, 2019\n\nAnderson Cooper to Joe Biden: \u201cMr Trump has falsely accused your son\u2026.\u201d well so much for an unbiased media at the debate!! @CNN @NewYorkTimes11 @nytopinion \u2014 Kristi Nelson (Gittins) (@kgittins) October 16, 2019\n\nAnderson Cooper just prefaced his question to Biden by noting \"You have been falsely accused.\" I had a hard time deciding whether to laugh, yell or throw up. What a joke. \u2014 Jeff Carlson (@themarketswork) October 16, 2019\n\nCooper to Biden: \"Trump FALSELY accused your son \u2026 \"\n\nA Candy Crowely moment? \u2014 SNARK-enfreude (@Fritzz2009) October 16, 2019\n\nAnderson Cooper just said Trump falsely accused Hunter Biden.

Remarkable neutral media. \u2014 Taylor (@oldarmy1) October 16, 2019\n\nAnderson Cooper really just said Trump FALSELY accused Hunter Biden of wrongdoing. Cooper, your bias is showing. #DemDebate \u2014 Jessica Fletcher (@heckyessica) October 16, 2019\n\nLOL Anderson Cooper asks abt conflict of interest re: Hunter Biden/Ukraine and says: \u201cTrump has *falsely* accused your son of doing something wrong\u201d and said there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that Biden engaged in any \u201cwrongdoing.\u201d This is a very serious, unbiased debate, guys. #DemDebate \u2014 Amanda Prestigiacomo (@AmandaPresto) October 16, 2019\n\nBiden pressed on his son Hunter\u2019s shady Ukraine dealings: \"What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate.
