Freedom of speech, I thought that is OK, but I get fined for it. That is the league. That is what they do. They fine you for some ridiculous things. It is just how it is. There is a reason everybody is talking about it. It is not just me. It goes for every team. With how our team is, we are not going to get a lot of calls and we know that. Especially going into this week, there is no time to worry about it and no time to stress about it. Just play our game.\u201d\n\nMayfield said he knew he\u2019d be fined when complaining about the officiating after the Week Six loss to the Seahawks. He echoed that sentiment on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI knew I was going to get fined, but it needs to be said,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cPeople have to be held accountable for their job. When it affects my job, it sucks because it is not in my control.\u201d\n\nMayfield\u2019s original fine happened simply because he said the officiating was \u201cpretty bad today.\u201d His more recent complaints about the fine and his reiterated concerns about officiating could result in yet another fine.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether the league fines him again will show whether the league is serious about using the threat of monetary sanctions to get players to not say what everyone else is saying: The NFL\u2019s officiating simply isn\u2019t good enough, and the NFL isn\u2019t doing nearly enough to fix the problem.", "description": "The NFL has decided to deal with its officiating crisis by silencing internal dissent.
