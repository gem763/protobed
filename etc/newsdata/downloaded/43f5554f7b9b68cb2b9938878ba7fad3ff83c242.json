It underlines the danger that Brexit could lead to a long-term souring in relations with continental Europe, and a politics of embittered nationalism in the UK.\n\nFor Brussels, the danger is that the EU will ultimately be faced with two angry and alienated neighbours, in Britain and Russia. Both are great powers in European terms, with considerable capacity to make mischief.\n\nIt is of course true that Britain has a liberal and democratic tradition that is absent in Russia. That aligns London\u2019s political values much more closely with Paris and Berlin than Moscow. Those values make it much less likely that the British political class will allow the country to \u201cgo rogue\u201d in the manner of Russia under Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut geopolitics is not driven by values alone. There are also emotions and strategic interests involved. And here the parallels between post-Soviet Russia and post-Brexit Britain are concerning.\n\nThe economic turmoil and strategic setbacks of the 1990s convinced many Russians that their country had been taken advantage of by the west. Russian anger focused on the US and on NATO expansion. But the Kremlin also came to see the EU as a threat \u2014 since, in Moscow\u2019s eyes, it was expanding into Russia\u2019s natural hinterland.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s decision to intervene militarily in Ukraine was triggered by the fact that the country was about to sign an association agreement with the EU.\n\nIf Brexit goes badly wrong, it could trigger events reminiscent of the collapse of the Soviet Union \u2014 the break-up of the country, accompanied by a profound economic shock.\n\nEnglish nationalists would undoubtedly see the EU as complicit in such malign events: some critics already accuse Brussels of manufacturing artificial problems on the Irish border, unreasonably delaying a free-trade deal and encouraging Scottish independence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the moment, British and EU officials are careful still to talk the language of friendship and future partnership. But, beneath the surface and off the record, antagonisms are stirring.\n\nOne influential former EU official argued to me recently that because Brexit Britain would be a threat to the EU, it is in Europe\u2019s interests to encourage Scottish independence and Irish unity. (Wine had been consumed \u2014 but in vino veritas.)\n\nWhen, with the Russian parallel in mind, I suggested that it would be a bad idea to humiliate the UK, I was told that Britain was responsible for its own humiliation; and besides, the UK had humiliated the EU by voting to leave. (\u201cYou said you are better than us.\u201d)\n\nEven on the record, you can hear hints of rivalry stirring. Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, usually the voice of moderation, said recently that Britain will be a \u201ccompetitor\u201d to the EU after Brexit \u2014 bracketing it with China and the US.\n\nIf, as seems likely, the EU responds to that perceived competitive threat by refusing to move towards tariff-free trade with Britain, then antagonism between London and Brussels will grow. The Europeans will argue, with some justification, that Britain has brought its sorry fate upon itself \u2014 just like Russia.\n\nBut winning the debate would not head off confrontation.\n\nIn an increasingly bad situation, the UK (or possibly just England) would play what few cards it has \u2014 cutting back on security and diplomatic co-operation with Europe, and working with forces that are hostile to the EU.\n\nThese threats are not taken very seriously in EU capitals at the moment because Britain is in such a mess. The same dismissive attitude was adopted towards the Russians in the 1990s. After all, their country had just fallen apart and their economy was in freefall. But, spurred on by a feeling of humiliation, Russia reasserted its power \u2014 in ways that the EU now finds alarming.\n\nThe lesson is that countries that have been major European powers for centuries are unlikely simply to drift into irrelevance. Their interests need to be accommodated. If that cannot be done, they will have to be confronted. Either way, a European construction that excludes Britain and Russia is unlikely to be either stable or secure. gideon.rachman@ft.com\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "After Brexit, the UK could drift into an antagonistic relationship with its continental neighbours - like the one Russia has with the EU.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6df785ca3a2a53e8f5cd3d14f8da40f686718e4d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
