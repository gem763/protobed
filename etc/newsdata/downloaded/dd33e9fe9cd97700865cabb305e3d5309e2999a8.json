You never know when it\u2019s 1-0 \u2014 you always want to get more.\n\n\u201cThey are dangerous going forward and their goalkeeper made some spectacular saves. I was pleased to come on and give us a bit of comfort. There was a real purpose to our game today.\u201d\n\nBernard made the breakthrough after latching onto a fine ball from Theo Walcott. The Brazilian declined to shoot first time as Arthur Masuaku closed him down but he cleverly cut back and wrong-footed the defender before sliding the ball under Roberto.\n\nRicharlison went close to a second from an Alex Iwobi pass but his low shot came back off a post and Iwobi then shot at Roberto from distance.\n\nA disappointing West Ham side made it to the break trailing by just a single goal but Everton were quickly on top again in the second half.\n\nRicharlison had the ball in the net just after the re-start following a neat build-up but his well-taken effort was ruled out for off-side.\n\nPablo Fornals had a golden chance to equalise minutes later but he could only steer it wide of the left post, falling to his knees in disappointment.\n\nYerry Mina twice headed too close to Roberto from corners and the Toffees went close again as Walcott rattled the crossbar with a ferocious half-volley before Iwobi wasted another chance, shooting straight at Roberto when clean through.\n\nDespite being outplayed, West Ham were still in the game and earned a couple of late chances against an increasingly edgy Everton.\n\nEverton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford did well to keep out a deflected close-range strike from Angelo Ogbonna.\n\nBut the home side finally made the game safe when Sigurdsson curled the ball past the diving Roberto from the edge of the box.", "description": "Liverpool (AFP) \u2013 Everton climbed out of the Premier League relegation zone on Saturday with a well-deserved 2-0 victory against West Ham that eased", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/34194c_bernard-centre-scores-everton-west-ham-everton-beat-west-ham-ease-pressure-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
