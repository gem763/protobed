They were embarrassed to say how they had arrived at their decision and merely said a decision had been taken, that even though there were instances where my rights were undermined, after weighing the arguments out they deemed the crime I committed to be too grave making it acceptable that my rights be infringed upon\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat shocked us is that high court rulings are above all other rulings so this court could not arrive at such a decision... this is very unusual,\u201d said Zuma to cheers from the large crowed that had gathered outside the court in articulation of the start of the former president\u2019s criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nMT @JKwritingz: Zuma: This case has been dragging on for almost 15 years which resulted in my legal team applying for a permanent stay of prosecution. Too much has happened in the 15 years that mean I cannot afford a fair trial. #ZumaTrial \u2014 City Press (@City_Press) October 15, 2019\n\nZuma\u2019s legal team, led by advocate Thabani Masuku, told the court their client would be appealing the dismissal of his application in line with the law which affords Zuma the right to appeal within 15 days of Friday\u2019s judgement.\n\nJudges Mnguni, Poyo-Dlwati and Steyn last week dismissed Zuma\u2019s application, saying the \u201cunreasonable delay\u201d in prosecution \u2013 which Zuma has argued to be prejudicial to his cause \u2013 could not only be credited to the National Prosecution Authority but also the former president\u2019s numerous court challenges.\n\nRT @JKwritingz: Zuma explains why proceedings have been postponed to next year, he says his legal team still seeks to test the ruling made last week.#ZumaTrial pic.twitter.com/lcztcdWVdJ \u2014 City Press (@City_Press) October 15, 2019\n\nAs a result, the court dismissed Zuma\u2019s application with costs, paving the way for him to face 16 charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering relating to the arms deal.\n\n\n\nIt is alleged that Zuma received 783 payments, totalling just over R4 million, from his then financial adviser Schabir Shaik and his Nkobi group of companies between 1996 and 2005.\n\nThe criminal trial has since been postponed to February 4 2020 to make way for the appeal to be had before a full bench in November.\n\nAlthough the state, through advocate Billy Downer, indicated that the National Prosecuting Authority would challenge the appeal, the state was in agreement with Zuma\u2019s legal team that it would be best for all parties that proceedings only commence in February 4 2020.\n\n\u201cThe appeal against last week\u2019s application by Zuma can only be heard before a full bench and the earliest this can happen is November 22,\u201d said Downer.\n\nREAD: Mondli Makhanya: What now for Zuma\u2019s Stalingrad?\n\nThe two parties agreed on February 4 as a holding day for the pre-trial arguments, saying it would be favourable as all parties would by then know how far the appeal processes would have gone.\n\nDuring his address outside the court, Zuma also made reference to the fact that some within his own organisation, the ANC, have now turned against him and called on those still in his corner to again gather in numbers when the case next appears.", "description": "Zuma accuses the High Court of undermining his rights.", "authors": ["Juniour Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9473/0f9530e8a09344adb1389b886656e9d9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
