Were I trying to curb my smartphone addiction\u2014which I\u2019m not, because that is a Sisyphean task\u2014here\u2019s what I\u2019d check out first:\n\nWhat I love about Morph is how this app turns your home screen and launcher into a productivity experiment. Instead of using the standard Google home screen and launcher that you\u2019re probably used to seeing on your device\u2014assuming you\u2019re using a Pixel, like I am\u2014you gain the ability to set different home screens and launchers for different, larger tasks.\n\nFor example, using Morph, you can select different \u201cmodes\u201d to pick from, like \u201cWork,\u201d \u201cHome,\u201d and TK. Within each mode, you pick a few apps you\u2019d want to be able to access for whatever it is you\u2019re doing. They appear on your home screen and, as an added bonus, all notifications from apps that aren\u2019t your handpicked items get blocked.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel like switching modes manually, you can have Morph set modes based on specific times or, better yet, locations\u2014in other words, gym mode can kick in whenever you\u2019re at the gym, and all you have to mess with is the music you want to play while you lift (or whatever it is you do to distract yourself). Switching between modes is as easy as swiping up and down, though, so it\u2019s OK to go manual, too.\n\nThis one isn\u2019t an app, so much as a wallpaper. Install Unlock Clock onto your device and set it up as your wallpaper, much as you would a new image, by scrolling to find it in the \u201cLive Wallpaper\u201d category of your wallpaper-picking screen. How it works is quite simple: You see a big-arse number on the centre of your screen. Each time you unlock your phone, the number goes up. And, as far as I know, this number resets each day.\n\nThe point? You can see how much you\u2019ve been using your device\u2014really using your device\u2014with a raw count of how many times you unlock it. Once you start hitting the triple-digits, it might be time to put the smartphone down and distract yourself with some other hobby or interest.\n\nAnd, yes, Unlock Clock\u2019s name is a bit of a misnomer. It\u2019s not a clock, more a counter. I hope you will be able to forgive Google for the deception.\n\nIf you need a nuclear option for managing your many notifications, consider Post Box. Sure, Android 10 gives you a number of options for reducing the flurry of pings and updates you get on your device, but Post Box is a great alternative if you really want to go cold turkey with all the annoyances.\n\nInstall the app,and you get to pick one of four delivery options: one, two, three, or four times per day. These, of course, are for the bundle of notifications that Post Box will be storing in the background. You won\u2019t get a single notification going forward, save for the deluge that arrives at whatever delivery times you\u2019ve set within the app.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. You can check back with the app to find out when your next delivery is, but you won\u2019t be able to coax any notifications out until it\u2019s time. Cruel? Yes. Effective? Absolutely.\n\nEverything else Google Creative Lab launched\n\nThe aforementioned three apps are the ones I found most effective at curbing one\u2019s smartphone addiction. However, there are three others worth checking out, too, as Android Police notes. (I just didn\u2019t fall as in love with them as the others.)", "description": "Android:\u00a0The Google Creative Lab has kicked six new experimental apps out into the wild, all designed with one purpose in mind\u2014to get you to stop obsessing over every notification, checking every social network, and generally gluing your phone to your face (or hand) for the better part of your day....", "authors": ["Lifehacker Staff", "John Long"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/v2eelcnud8taisx7wuwk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
