He has no agenda apart from answering the Committees\u2019 questions fully and truthfully,\u201d Luskin said in the statement.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the State Department\u2019s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u2019 subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,\u201d Luskin said.\n\n\u201cThe subpoena was issued hours after Sondland was ordered by the White House not to appear for a scheduled deposition with the Democrat-led House committees leading the impeachment probe,\u201d CNBC reported.\n\nCNBC reported on the text messages that connect Sondland to Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president where the president spoke about efforts to investigate corruption in the country, including Hunter Biden\u2019s controversial involvement with an energy conglomerate while Joe Biden was vice president. According to the report:\n\nSondland\u2019s text messages with other U.S. diplomats were released last week after they were given to those House panels by former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker during his own deposition. In a Sept. 9 exchange, Bill Taylor, a senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, told Sondland: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Sondland responded: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that [Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky] promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nThe White House legal team also sent a letter to House Democrats that laid out the reasons the administration would not cooperate with the various committees looking into Trump\u2019s alleged misdeeds.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, will sit for a deposition as part of the Trump impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1175169658-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
