In an area that's recently gone weeks without rain, the storm was seen more as a welcome sight.\n\n\"You have to keep it in perspective: 75 percent of our city was destroyed,\" Cathey said. \"A little rain is welcome. Hopefully it won't be something crazy, but if that's all it is, I can deal with that. There's nothing in this system that I've seen that tells me Mexico Beach needs to be alarmed.\"\n\nBy early Saturday morning, the storm was centered about 85 miles south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It had top sustained winds of 50 mph and was moving northeast at 17 mph.\n\nNational Weather Service\n\nNestor was expected to move inland over the Florida Panhandle later Saturday morning, and then move across parts of the southeastern U.S. on Saturday and Sunday. It's expected to move offshore of the coast of North Carolina and into the western Atlantic Ocean by late Sunday.\n\nThe storm's expected to further weaken once it moves inland, and is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone later Saturday. A tropical storm warning west of the Okaloosa/Walton County line in Florida has been discontinued.", "description": "Storm surge and winds are lashing much of Florida's Gulf Coast", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/19/87934e2a-63c0-42f3-a0c0-32a429a57453/thumbnail/1200x630/9c51b7aa7e3a0c98c1b886522acd3805/storm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
