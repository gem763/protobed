Investigators believe his phone may have been in \u201csleep mode\u201d when it sent its final signal.\n\nThe hat was discovered by a volunteer search group, which has continued to scour the area for any trace of the missing teen since he disappeared more than five months ago.\n\nThe case was referred to the coroner in September, when Theo\u2019s father Laurent Hayez returned to Australia for an update on the investigation. Theo\u2019s 19th birthday was on September 29. The teenager had been travelling around Australia for five months when he went missing.\n\nHACKERS SEARCH FOR THEO\n\nOver the weekend, Theo\u2019s case was marked as one of the 12 missing person cases to be investigated by the National Missing Person\u2019s Hackathon.\n\nThe Hackathon involved law enforcement empowering about 350 \u201cethical hackers\u201d across 10 locations around the country to use their online sleuthing skills to generate new leads for law enforcement to crack cold cases. The joint initiative involved the AustCyber Canberra Cyber Security Innovation Node, the Australian Federal Police, the National Missing Persons Co-ordination Centre and Trace Labs. Hackers don\u2019t engage with victims\u2019 families and are discouraged from speculating on the intelligence they gather.\n\nThe results were profound, with 100 leads generated for every 10 minutes the teams worked, according to the ABC. The hackers worked using a combination of \u201copen source intelligence\u201d, meaning publicly available data, and information collected from the dark web to gather intelligence.", "description": "The family of missing backpacker Theo Hayez say they believe a hat found in bushland in Byron Bay belongs him.", "authors": ["Phoebe Loomes"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3e953d2ebf0a8a1a8cddecf5bba99d6a?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
