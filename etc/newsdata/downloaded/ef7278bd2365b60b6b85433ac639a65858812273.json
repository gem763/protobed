The most likely explanation seems to be he simply lost track of where he was and thought he was driving back in Romania, which is why, even when others were driving towards him, he did nothing.\n\n'It tends to suggest he thought he was on the right side of the road.'\n\nProsecutor Michael Bunch said: 'After passing the tractor, the defendant's vehicle continued past the other car, leading the driver to comment that the driver must have thought he was on a dual carriageway.\n\n'Initially the oncoming lane was clear but as the west-bound traffic approached a bend, three cars appeared in view, heading east.\n\n'The defendant's car took no evasive action until it was too late and collided with the first east-bound car.'\n\nMrs Oliver, in the Hyundai, had only driven a short distance to post a letter in Haydon Bridge.\n\nShe saw Grancea's car heading straight for her and assumed it would pull back into the correct lane, but it continued on a collision course.\n\nMrs Oliver tried to pull left, out of his way, but Grancea pulled right at the same time and they collided.\n\nThe driver of the car Grancea had overtaken after the tractor said he saw him get out of his car and go round to the passenger side, where he saw him shake Miss Radvan, whose head was slumped on her chest, and he slapped her face to try to rouse her. She died at the scene from her injuries.\n\nMiss Menea, who lost consciousness for a time, suffered spinal fractures and a fracture to a bone in her pelvis.\n\nMrs Oliver suffered fractures to her spine and had to wear a halo brace for two to three months. She also had fractures to her collarbone and pain in her arm and hip.\n\nDid you know the victim?
