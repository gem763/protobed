Canada has now added 358,100 since December, the most in the first nine months of a year since 2002.\n\nCanada\u2019s labour market seems to have been vaccinated against the global economic flu going around Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets\n\nThe strong print will only reaffirm Bank of Canada expectations that the economy has developed a certain amount of resilience to trade headwinds and global economic uncertainties, giving it ammunition to buck the global trend of lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s labour market seems to have been vaccinated against the global economic flu going around,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets Inc., said in a note to investors.\n\nThe rise in employment dropped the unemployment rate to 5.5 per cent, from 5.7 per cent in August, near the lowest in the past four decades.\n\nEconomists were anticipating just 7,500 jobs in September, with the unemployment rate unchanged. Canada\u2019s dollar jumped after the report, rising 0.5 per cent to C$1.3227 against its U.S. counterpart at 8:33 a.m. Toronto time. Yields on government two-year bonds increased 9 basis points to 1.63 per cent.\n\nThe underlying details of the report were not as strong as the headline number. While the gains were all full-time, they were entirely public-sector positions and self-employed. Private sector jobs dropped by 21,000, with continued weakness in goods-producing industries.\n\nOn the plus side, not only is employment growing, but so are wages. Hourly pay was up 4.3 per cent in September from a year earlier, accelerating from a 3.7 per cent pace in August. The last few months have seen the strongest year-over-year increases in a decade\n\nGet More", "description": "The economy gains 53,700 job, blowing past forecasts", "authors": ["Theophilos Argitis", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jobs2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
