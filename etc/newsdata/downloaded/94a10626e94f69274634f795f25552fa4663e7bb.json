Retailers and manufacturers could be fined $1,000 for violations.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, over the weekend signed Assembly Bill 44 into law, which bans the sale and manufacturing of fur products in California. Retailers and manufacturers could be fined $1,000 for violations. \u201cCalifornia is a leader when it comes to animal welfare and today that leadership includes banning the sale of fur,\u201d Newsom said, announcing the legislation.\n\nThat was followed on Monday by an announcement from Macy\u2019s Inc. M, +2.79% that it would stop selling real fur products at its department stores, which includes Bloomingdale\u2019s, by the end of fiscal 2020.\n\nThe California prohibition applies to clothing, handbags, footwear, hats, or any accessories like key chains that contain fur. Each violation carries a civil penalty. The new law exempts leather, cowhide and shearling, plus fur products used for religious purposes. The law also exempts taxidermy products, fur originating from an animal killed by someone with a hunting license, and secondhand fur.\n\nThis is the first statewide fur ban in the U.S., but it follows the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles, which separately announced last year that they\u2019re banning the sale of animal fur products. The anti-fur movement has also gone global: Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Norway, Luxembourg and Serbia, among others, have banned fur farming.\n\nThe fur industry, unsurprisingly, reacted swiftly to the news of California\u2019s fur ban. \u201cGovernor Newsom has now made California the first state in the nation to abolish a centuries-old, lawful, highly regulated, job-producing, environmentally sound, tax-paying industry,\u201d according to the Fur Council of America, an industry trade group.\n\nU.S. fur sales hit $531 million last year, reaching a 17-year high, according to Euromonitor International. That\u2019s up from $337 billion in 2014.\n\n\u201cHe has failed to recognize the human toll here resulting from the government forcing these businesses to close with no compensation to the business owners. They will lose generations of investment [and] their livelihoods will be cut off and for many in long-term lease agreements.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir staffs, many of them highly skilled craftsmen, will join the ranks of the unemployed, unlikely to find work at similar wage levels,\u201d it added. \u201cTo be sure, it is the stuff of legacy, just not the legacy any other chief executive would want.\u201d\n\nNationwide, however, fur sales are on the rise. U.S. fur sales hit $531 million last year, reaching a 17-year high, according to the market-research firm Euromonitor International. That\u2019s up from $337 billion in 2014.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all fur hats, gloves and coats. Spending on fur by the furniture industry, has risen by roughly 2% annually in recent year as a chair covering and in other soft furnishings. An investigation by National Geographic earlier this month suggested that many people have turned a blind eye to graphic images of animals kept captive in industrial-scale fur farms.\n\nFur farms dominate the trade, and production has more than doubled since the 1990s, to about 100 million skins last year, mostly mink and some fox,\u201d it found. \u201cTrappers typically add millions of wild beaver, coyote, raccoon, muskrat and other skins. That\u2019s besides untold millions of cattle, lambs, rabbits, ostriches, crocodiles, alligators and caimans harvested for food as well as skins.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S, fur is still being used by some of the biggest fashion designers in the world and sold by America\u2019s most exclusive department stores, although it does not come cheap.\n\nIndustrialization has made the problem even more acute for both the animals and those who want to ban fur farming and trapping. \u201cLike pig or chicken farming, fur farming is about keeping animals in captivity their entire lives and then killing them. It entails practices many people would consider unthinkable. Some fox farmers, for example, kill their animals by anal electrocution. It\u2019s supposedly the quickest practical method,\u201d National Geographic added.\n\nIn the U.S., however, fur is still being used by some of the biggest fashion designers and sold \u2014 for now at least\u2014 at the most exclusive department stores, although it does not come cheap. Fur coats cost $24,900 for a belted mink coat by The Row at Bergdorf Goodman or $30,500 for a mink coat with crystal embroidery by Oscar de la Renta at Neiman Marcus. There\u2019s also a brisk market in pre-owned, professionally appraised furs on sites such as EstateFurs.\n\nIn announcing its upcoming fur ban, Macy\u2019s said Monday that it has had regular conversations with the Humane Society and other groups, and noted that improvements in fabric technologies such as faux fur should make the transition easier, the Associated Press reported. New York City and state are also mulling similar bans on the manufacture and sale of fur.\n\nPETA, meanwhile, applauded Newsom for introducing a statewide fur ban. \u201cPETA pushed hard and thousands of our supporters wrote to their representatives in support of the ban,\u201d it said. \u201cThis lifesaving measure will prevent animals from being beaten, electrocuted, and skinned alive for environmentally toxic items that compassionate shoppers no longer want and top designers no longer use.\u201d", "description": "Demand for this luxury material in the U.S. has actually increased in recent years, despite stores like Macy\u2019s saying it will soon ban the sale of fur.", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GR130_fur_co_ZG_20181003162716.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
