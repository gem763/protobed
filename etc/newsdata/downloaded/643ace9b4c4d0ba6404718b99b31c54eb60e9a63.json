No, I do not accept it,\" he told Le Pelerin (via Sport Witness ).\n\n(Image: REUTERS/Hannah McKay)\n\n\"You do not have to be fatalistic in certain situations. I have always been respectful and humble. Even if I do not agree with the coach, I do not criticise him.\n\n\"But in myself, I cannot accept it because I know what I'm worth on a pitch. Last year, when I felt that I deserved to play, I asked the coach for explanations.\"\n\nGiroud, who made 20 of his 27 Premier League appearances from the bench last season, joined Chelsea from local rivals Arsenal in January 2018.\n\nAnd despite admitting that his decision to leave the Gunners was a difficult one to make, the forward said he does not regret the move and believes it was a step up due to the recent success of the two sides.\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\n\"It was not easy to leave Arsenal for Chelsea two years ago. I loved Arsenal,\" added Giroud, who scored the only goal in France's 1-0 win over Iceland on Friday.\n\n\"But it was a progression because Chelsea is the English club that has won the most titles, with Manchester City , in ten years.\n\n\"I had competitors in attack \u2013 [Alvaro] Morata, [Gonzalo] Higuain, who ended up leaving. I won at the end: I played the final of the FA Cup in 2018 and the [Europa League] final in 2019.\n\n\"Once again, I'm starting the year in a difficult situation. But as my brother says, I have always built myself in the face of adversity. Although I would like there to be less!\"", "description": "The French striker has started just one Premier League game for Frank Lampard's side this season", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Reuters Hannah Mckay", "Getty Images Europe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574229.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Champions-League-Group-H-Chelsea-v-Valencia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
