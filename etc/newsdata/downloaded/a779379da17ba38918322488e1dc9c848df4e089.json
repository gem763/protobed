In some cases, it could be temporary discouragement. In others, it could be a result of burnout. We all need breaks. Even Jesus took time for rest. God has even built into the week one day off---the Sabbath. If we burn the candle from both ends, we can suffer the consequences of burnout.\n\nIn still other cases it can be the result of perhaps a terrible experience, like a brutal church split. I once experienced a church split---I told people this is as close to a divorce as I ever hope to get.\n\nIn some cases, those who fall away may have done so because they associate pain with the faith. Christian apologist Alex McFarland wrote a whole book, 10 Answers for Skeptics (Bethany House, 2011), where he dissects the unbelief of many modern-day skeptics and provides answers to their objections.\n\nAlex told me, \"In medicine, physicians sometimes speak of a patient's 'presenting problem,' which may be different from their actual problem. Some diagnostic questions and a thorough examination help the doctor determine the true source of an illness. In apologetics and evangelism this is also very much the case. The objection that a skeptic presents may not at all be the actual reason that they have rejected God, or have turned away from Christianity. \u201c\n\nFor his books, McFarland spent a lot of time interviewing 34 professed atheists. He said to me, \u201cSurprisingly, 28 of the atheists I interviewed were ex-Protestants. 100% of the people I interviewed answered affirmatively that they had or still do occasionally pray. In fact, immediately after a radio debate with one atheist (during which he had vehemently defended his unbelief), off air he asked me to pray for his wife who had cancer.\u201d\n\nWhat are we to make of this? McFarland sheds further light: \u201cFor years I said, \u2018emotional pain is often the starting point for intellectual skepticism.\u2019 I now modify that to say, \u2018The road to skepticism always begins with emotional pain.\u2019 It is the default position of the human mind to believe in God. Atheism is a learned pathology. It is counter-intuitive on so many levels. However, many skeptics resolutely train themselves to see the world through the eyes of unbelief because of disappointment with God through some past experience.\u201d\n\nFinally, McFarland noted, \u201cAs I interviewed atheists, my heart went out to so many of them who tearfully told about their perception of unanswered prayers, loved ones who weren't healed of terminal illnesses, toxic experiences in church, and respected \u2018Christian leaders\u2019 who in some way let them down.\u201d Painful indeed.\n\nMeanwhile, Christianity is based on some bedrock facts of history. And no amount of disbelief voids those facts of history.\n\nIn a different context, John Adams once said, \u201cFacts are stubborn things.\u201d The facts surrounding the death and resurrection of Jesus are solid. He was crucified publicly in the Roman Empire, and then soon after reports popped up all over the place of Him appearing to various people---mostly His disciples. But in two cases, He appeared to skeptics, who became converted---Saul of Tarsus, who became Paul the Apostle, and James, who later became the Bishop of Jerusalem.\n\nThe most important consideration is that even if millions of professing Christians fell away, it still would not undermine the fact that Jesus Christ rose from the dead.\n\nLuke was a first century physician. He was a companion and fellow traveler with the Apostle Paul. Luke wrote one of the four Gospels, and he followed it up with the first chronicle of the early church, the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nEarly in that book, Dr. Luke states, \u201cTo these [the apostles] He [Jesus] also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.\u201d (Acts 1:3, NASB)\n\nThe original skeptics of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead were the apostles themselves. Jesus manifested Himself as alive over and over, providing them with \u201cmany convincing proofs.\u201d Those apostles were so convinced they went out to the four corners of the earth (\u201cDoubting Thomas\u201d as far as south India) to proclaim Christ and Him crucified and risen from the dead. Most of them were martyred for this proclamation.\n\nThere are solid historical reasons for believing that Christianity is true, and Alex McFarland has written many books demonstrating this.\n\nIt is tragic to see Christians fall away from the faith, but ultimately the loss is theirs. For the Bible notes, \u201cIt is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\u201d\n\nJerry Newcombe, D.Min., is an on-air host/senior producer for D. James Kennedy Ministries.
