At the same time, it\u2019s a film that straddles the past and the present, a decades-spanning tale of treachery, regret and amorality that\u2019s been designed for the big screen and yet will primarily be seen on Netflix (which produced it), and a rich, practically minded character study that employs breakthrough CGI to de-age its stars.\n\nIn every respect, it\u2019s epic. And, also, a titanic triumph.\n\nFirst, to answer the most pressing question on everyone\u2019s mind: The Irishman\u2019s special effects are largely successful at transforming its leads into their youthful selves. They\u2019re almost imperceptible when used for Pacino and Pesci, and with De Niro, they\u2019re only shaky when he\u2019s at his youngest, and spied from a distance. During those moments, the actor\u2019s appearance tips somewhat into video game-ish \u201cuncanny valley\u201d territory. But for the most part\u2014especially once the protagonists move into middle age and beyond\u2014one quickly acclimates to Scorsese\u2019s computerized makeovers. In short: the technique works.\n\nDebuting in theaters on Nov. 1 and on Netflix on Nov. 29 (following tonight\u2019s New York Film Festival world premiere), The Irishman begins with a trademark Scorsese journey through a well-populated interior space\u2014in this instance, a retirement home, where the director\u2019s camera turns this way and that to take in elderly residents before settling on wheelchair-bound Frank Sheeran (De Niro). It\u2019s from his reminiscing perspective that the ensuing narrative is told, although there are stratified layers of memories in Steven Zaillian\u2019s script, which also uses as a recurring framing device the 1975 drive to Detroit undertaken by Sheeran and his mob-boss benefactor and staunch friend Russell Bufalino (Pesci) and their two wives. In both of these sequences, exhaustion and melancholy go hand in hand, epitomized by a hilarious scene in which Bufalino\u2019s wife Carrie (Katherine Narducci) requests permission to smoke in the car, Bufalino explains (clearly for the umpteenth time) that he objects (\u201cI made a vow\u201d), and Carrie opts to take out a cigarette anyway. It\u2019s a moment primed for a Goodfellas-esque Pesci explosion, and yet in response to this disobedience, all his Bufalino can do is sigh.\n\nBased on Charles Brandt\u2019s book I Heard You Paint Houses, Scorsese\u2019s film concerns the harsher response to the far greater act of defiance perpetrated by Hoffa (Pacino), who became convinced that the vast power afforded by his position made him beyond reproach. That was fine so long as his relationship with his mobster bedfellows was strong. As most know, however, Hoffa vanished from the face of the Earth under famously unsolved circumstances, and The Irishman eventually details his downfall after his 1971 release from prison, when his ego prevented him from playing nice with rival Anthony Provenzano (a phenomenal Stephen Graham), as well as stomaching a reduced role in the organization he built. \u201cI am the Teamsters!\u201d he proclaims at one point, and later, \u201cNo one threatens Hoffa.\u201d These declarations resound as self-rung death knells for the big shot, who understands the rules of the game he\u2019s playing and yet thinks himself above them anyway, to his own fatal detriment.\n\nHewing to its source material, The Irishman contends that it was Sheeran\u2014Hoffa\u2019s friend and Teamsters compatriot\u2014who was responsible for the bigwig\u2019s demise, which makes the film, on the one hand, a piece of speculative historical crime fiction. Yet it\u2019s far more than that. Charting Sheeran\u2019s transition from lowly truck driver to Bufalino\u2019s right-hand man to Hoffa\u2019s trusted confidant and colleague, Scorsese\u2019s story focuses heavily on the way in which a working-class stiff rose up the underworld ranks by doing what he was told. It\u2019s an ethos Sheeran learned in WWII: in a flashback, we see him carry out his superiors\u2019 implied instructions to kill two POWs after forcing them to dig their own graves. And it\u2019s one he continued to embrace in his subsequent mafia role, where he became adept at \u201cpainting houses\u201d (code for killing people) whenever ordered.\n\nThere are executions in The Irishman, including that of \u201cCrazy\u201d Joe Gallo (Sebastian Maniscalco), and Scorsese shoots them with a swift, ferocious bluntness that neuters any traditional sense of \u201cexcitement\u201d; they\u2019re case studies in the banality of evil. Murder is depicted as punishment for insolently violating Cosa Nostra guidelines about respect and having loose lips, and Hoffa is thus merely the highest-profile example of what happens to anyone who doesn\u2019t toe the company line. In this saga of 20th-century American corruption, replete with subplots about Sheeran and company\u2019s involvement in JFK\u2019s election and assassination, there\u2019s always someone higher up on the hierarchical ladder. And to test their tolerance for rebelliousness, much less power-hungry greed, is to tempt fate.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s a film that straddles the past and the present, a decades-spanning tale of treachery, regret and amorality. \u201d\n\nDe Niro\u2019s Sheeran understands this fundamental truth, and accepts it without reservation. This makes him a part of the \u201cfamily,\u201d despite his Irish heritage setting him apart from his Italian cohorts. His devotion to Bufalino, however, alienates him from daughter Peggy (Lucy Gallina as an adolescent; Anna Paquin as an adult), who as a kid watches her father brutally beat a shopkeeper for a minor infraction, and who spends the rest of her screen time flashing him accusatory stares. She\u2019s the proceedings\u2019 silent Greek chorus, her gaze a damning indictment of his failures as a father and a man\u2014shortcomings directly brought about by his adherence to his chosen profession\u2019s inflexible protocols.\n\nAs established by the nursing-home scenes, Sheeran survived to old age, thereby making him \u201clucky\u201d when compared to so many associates. In a cheeky, pointed device that epitomizes the film\u2019s surprising humor, Scorsese often freeze-frames on random Mafiosos in order to present textual information about their untimely demises. With both grimness and absurdity, The Irishman is upfront about the fact that unromantic, backstabbing doom awaits most of these wiseguys, either literally or figuratively (Hoffa\u2019s chants of \u201cSolidarity!\u201d to union members consequently play as an ironic joke). It\u2019s the latter that Sheeran is destined to suffer once commanded to handle Hoffa. Scorsese spends hours establishing the duo\u2019s growing closeness and, more wrenching still, Hoffa\u2019s fatherly bond with young Peggy\u2014a relationship contrasted with her detachment from Bufalino, and one that makes Sheeran\u2019s ultimate hit an even graver betrayal.\n\nAided by ace cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Scorsese stages his action with a reserve that\u2019s anything but static or sluggish; his (relatively) unshowy camerawork perfectly suits a story drenched in despondency. That\u2019s also true of Robbie Robertson\u2019s soundtrack, punctuated not by Scorsese\u2019s beloved Rolling Stones but, instead, The Five Satins\u2019 \u201cIn the Still of the Night,\u201d which is all the more haunting for being so thematically apt. As evoked by an initial cut from senior-citizen Sheeran to a gun firing and blood splattering a wall, the lingering weight of violence on a person\u2019s conscience and soul, especially as they near death, is central to The Irishman, resulting in an oppressive, and devastating, elegiac atmosphere.\n\n\u201c The Irishman is, at heart, about the passage of time, and its effect on one\u2019s perception of themselves, their lives, and the things they\u2019ve done. \u201d\n\nSheeran\u2019s late confession that he doesn\u2019t feel anything about the horrors he\u2019s perpetrated underscores Scorsese\u2019s critique of his protagonist, and by extension, the illicit system to which he swore loyalty at the expense of family, friends and morality. De Niro does much by doing very little as Sheeran, using a placid, squint-and-scowl expression to convey his character\u2019s empty coldness. No matter his affection for Hoffa or his offspring, he\u2019s an individual who\u2019s made himself into a receptive vessel for others\u2019 commands, and De Niro is riveting in a performance that relies heavily on nuance. That goes double for Pesci, who never raises his voice and still manages to exude imposing menace and authority, all while simultaneously suggesting sensitivity around the edges of his sternness. In its cagey subtlety, it\u2019s a powerhouse turn.\n\nNonetheless, in the first big-screen collaboration for its headlining trio (not to mention Scorsese favorite Harvey Keitel, in a small early role), it\u2019s Pacino who stands tallest. Obsessed with ice cream and punctuality, his Hoffa initially comes on like a hoo-ahing force of nature, riling up crowds (and his sense of self) and ranting at minions who can\u2019t get his orders right. Like Pesci, though, he does his best work at the corners, as when he becomes so frustrated during a rant that he literally pauses and droops his head to catch his breath and compose himself\u2014and then, when Sheeran takes hilarious umbrage with his insults, he segues on a dime from wide-eyed flamethrower to apologetic buddy. Pacino hasn\u2019t been this magnetic in some time, and his tour-de-force culminates with a pleading conversation between Sheeran and Hoffa at the former\u2019s awards ceremony that\u2014marked by the fateful phrase, \u201cIt\u2019s what it is\u201d\u2014is the stuff of tragedy.\n\nRepeated shots of Sheeran\u2019s gold watch underline that The Irishman is, at heart, about the passage of time, and its effect on one\u2019s perception of themselves, their lives, and the things they\u2019ve done. It\u2019s not difficult to see that theme echoed in the film\u2019s gathering together of these acclaimed actors for one last hurrah about a subject that\u2014thanks to Goodfellas, Casino and even The Godfather\u2014has greatly defined their careers. And it\u2019s also, of course, easy to sense it in Scorsese\u2019s return to the gangster milieu that has served as such fertile inspiration for his own oeuvre. It\u2019s a place he continues to know better than almost anyone else. Although even more than the larger-than-life mobsters that inhabit his criminal sagas, it\u2019s the director himself\u2014a cinematic preservationist, champion, pioneer, artist\u2014who, with The Irishman, once again proves to be the truly timeless legend.", "description": "The lingering weight of violence on a person\u2019s conscience and soul, especially as they near death, is central to the auteur\u2019s new mob movie\u2014a triumphant culmination of his career.", "authors": ["Nick Schager"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569626971/190927-schager-irishmen-tease_2_mfqyoz", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
