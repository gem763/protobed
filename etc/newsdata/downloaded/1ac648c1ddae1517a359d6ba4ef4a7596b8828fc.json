(Matt Stone/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald)\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Bill Belichick defended the helmet-to-helmet hit that took out Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen during the fourth quarter of Sunday\u2019s game against the Patriots.\n\nThe hit, which was doled out by New England cornerback Jonathan Jones while safety Duron Harmon was also making contact, sent Allen to the sideline with a concussion. He is still in the league\u2019s protocol.\n\nSpeaking on the Ordway, Merloni & Fauria show on WEEI in Boston, Belichick said Jones was doing what he\u2019d been told to do during the play. \u201cJon did what we\u2019ve coached him to do. If that\u2019s a foul we\u2019ll have to coach him differently,\u201d Belichick said. In Belichick\u2019s eyes, it was Allen, not Jones, who lowered his head and created the helmet-to-helmet contact.\n\nJones was flagged on the play but thanks to an offsetting Buffalo infraction, the penalty was not enforced.\n\nHere's the hit on Josh Allen.pic.twitter.com/J9HCYhM9Pp \u2014 Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) September 29, 2019\n\n\u201cI think when a player, when there isn\u2019t really much you can tell him to do differently, then I think you don\u2019t tell him anything,\u201d Belichick said on a conference call Monday. \u201cI mean, Allen\u2019s a big runner, he\u2019s a strong guy, he\u2019s hard to tackle. He certainly broke several tackles against us. Jon turned when he hit him. He didn\u2019t lead with his head. He didn\u2019t have that posture. Ultimately the decision rests with (NFL Senior Vice President) Al Riveron, the game officials and the NFL office on that play. Really doesn\u2019t matter what you think or what I think or what anybody else thinks. They are the ones who are officiating the play. We\u2019ll coach it within the rules that\u2026as the rules are interpreted.\u201d\n\nAt this point, it seems Jones will not be suspended but he could still face a fine.\n\nThe Bills, who lost the game 16-10, obviously feel differently.\n\n#Bills head coach Sean McDermott says he thinks Jonathan Jones should have been ejected after that hit on Josh Allen in the 4th quarter. @WGRZ #BillsMafia pic.twitter.com/SlSHdK4AXQ \u2014 Heather Prusak (@haprusak) September 29, 2019\n\nIn a related story, Oakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict has been hit with a season-long suspension for his illegal headshot on Indianapolis tight end Jack Doyle.\n\nVontaze Burfict was ejected for this hit on Jack Doyle pic.twitter.com/vFply5QOKN \u2014 NFL Stats (@NFL_Stats) September 29, 2019\n\nA repeat offender who has previously been suspended twice for illegal hits, Burfict is expected to appeal the suspension.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at USA Today", "description": "Speaking on the Ordway, Merloni & Fauria\u00a0show on WEEI in Boston, Belichick said safety Jonathan Jonnes was doing what he'd been told to do during the play.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177928327-e1569936454179.jpg?fit=670%2C448", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
