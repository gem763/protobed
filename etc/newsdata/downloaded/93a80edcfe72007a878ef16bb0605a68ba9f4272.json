REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo\n\nItaly\u2019s tax police said on Friday they had found evidence that safety reports for some viaducts operated by Atlantia\u2019s motorway unit had been falsified or information omitted, with the aim of misleading transport ministry inspectors.\n\nOne employee at motorway unit Autostrade per l\u2019Italia and two officials at maintenance arm SPEA were placed under house arrest as part of the probe, which follows the collapse of a bridge operated by Autostrade in the city of Genoa that killed 43 people.\n\nShares in Atlantia, in which the Benetton family owns a 30.25% stake through its holding company Edizione, had shed 8.5% by 1220 GMT, adding to a 8.4% drop on Friday.\n\nAt the weekend Edizione issued an unusual sharply worded statement saying it was dismayed by the revelations of the probe, which focused on several motorway viaducts other than the one that collapsed last year.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the latest events, Edizione ... will without hesitation and immediately take all necessary actions ... to safeguard the credibility, reputation and good name of its shareholders and subsidiaries,\u201d the holding company said.\n\nAccording to a source close to the matter, the statement marked a \u201csharp change in the attitude of the Benetton family\u201d towards the company and the way it has been managed.\n\nThe family has so far supported Atlantia\u2019s long-standing CEO Giovanni Castellucci, who also served as chief executive at Autostrade per l\u2019Italia until last November.\n\nCastellucci and other top managers at Atlantia are under investigation, together with top officials at Italy\u2019s transport ministry, in a separate probe into the collapse of the Genoa bridge.\n\nThe Genoa disaster last year put the company under heavy political pressure, with ruling coalition party the 5-Star Movement demanding Autostrade be stripped of its motorway concession, which accounts for one third of its core profit.\n\nThe Edizione board is due to meet at 1300 GMT on Monday for an already-scheduled meeting whose agenda has not been made public.", "description": "Shares in Atlantia fell sharply on Monday ahead of a board meeting of its top investor Edizione, which a source said was expected to discuss allegations of falsified safety reports at the group's road operations.", "authors": ["Francesca Landini", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430447093&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0UP", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
