FOREX-Dollar picks up before Fed, pound braces for EU meeting on Brexit\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n* Dollar in focus as Fed meets, BOJ likely to stay pat\n\n* Brexit process dogs sterling\n\n* Trade war and Brexit woes pose risk to global economy\n\nBy Stanley White\n\nTOKYO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The dollar traded near its highest in more than\n\ntwo months versus the yen on Monday ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting this\n\nweek where policymakers are expected to cut interest rates but emphasise their\n\nreluctance to ease policy further.\n\nSterling edged lower versus the dollar and the euro, with an agreement\n\nexpected later on Monday to delay Britain's divorce from the European Union to\n\nJan. 31 after Prime Minister Boris Johnson failed to win approval for his Brexit\n\ntimetable.\n\nChina's yuan rose to its strongest level in two weeks on Monday after\n\nBeijing and Washington said they were \"close to finalizing\" a first-stage\n\nagreement to scale back their trade war, but some traders tempered their\n\noptimism because a quick resolution is far from certain.\n\nThe market focus will shift to the Fed meeting ending Oct. 30 and a Bank of\n\nJapan meeting ending Oct. 31. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates for a\n\nthird time this year, but fixed income analysts say this is largely priced into\n\nthe market. The BOJ is leaning toward keeping policy on hold next week, but the decision\n\nis a close call as policymakers struggle with threats to the global outlook from\n\nthe U.S.-China trade war and Brexit. \"A Fed rate cut is already factored in, but the dollar could be bought back\n\nif the Fed somehow signals it won't cut rates further,\" said Yukio Ishizuki,\n\nforeign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\"Until we can confirm this, traders are likely to adjust their existing\n\npositions in the dollar.\"\n\nThe dollar traded at 108.77 yen on Monday, close to 108.94 yen, which\n\nis the highest since Aug. 1.\n\nThe greenback was quoted at $1.1083 per euro, close to its strongest\n\nin more than a week.\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 fell 0.14% to $1.2818 and eased 0.15% to 86.48 pence per\n\neuro EURGBP=D3 .\n\nThe EU bloc's 27 ambassadors will meet at 0900 GMT on Monday in Brussels to\n\nagree on a three-month delay from the current Brexit date of Oct. 31, diplomatic\n\nsources told Reuters. More than three years after Britons voted in a referendum to quit the EU,\n\nthe country and its parliament remain divided over how, when and even whether to\n\nleave, and the matter has triggered a spiralling political crisis in the UK.\n\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at\n\n97.849, also near its highest in more than a week.\n\nThe Fed meeting this week is widely expected to result in a cut in interest\n\nrates of 25 basis points, and that has been priced in, but some analysts expect\n\nthe Fed to sound \"hawkish\" by signalling it is reluctant to cut rates further.\n\nThe U.S. currency got a mild boost on Friday after the U.S. Trade\n\nRepresentative's office said it is \"close to finalizing\" some parts of a trade\n\nagreement with China. On Saturday, China's Ministry of Commerce said \"technical consultations\" on\n\nsome parts of a trade agreement were basically completed, but investors are\n\nlikely to remain sceptical because even a partial deal would not eliminate risks\n\nposed by trade friction.\n\nIn the onshore market, the yuan CNY=CFXS briefly strengthened to 7.0523\n\nper dollar, the strongest since Oct. 14. In the offshore market, the yuan\n\nCNH=D3 briefly rose to 7.0450 per dollar on Monday, the strongest since Sept.\n\n13, but then gradually gave up its gains.", "description": "FOREX-Dollar picks up before Fed, pound braces for EU meeting on Brexit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB3C0TV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
