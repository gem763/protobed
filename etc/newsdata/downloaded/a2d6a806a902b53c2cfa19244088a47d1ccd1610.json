But as the clash begins to inflict economic pain on the global economy, negotiators from both sides seem increasingly focused on reaching a mini-deal that would resolve just a portion of the trade dispute.\n\nMyron Brilliant, the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the Chamber of Commerce, told reporters on Thursday that he was \u201chopeful\u201d that a limited arrangement stopping a planned tariff increase on Oct. 15 would emerge from this week\u2019s meetings.\n\nMr. Brilliant, who recently spoke with both negotiating teams, added that a more comprehensive pact could be announced this week but that the scope of the deal would depend on what Chinese negotiators brought to the table. The Trump administration could also contemplate removing the threat of additional tariffs that are scheduled to be imposed in December or roll back some of the tariffs it has already levied on more than $360 billion of Chinese goods based on the package of offers brought by the Chinese negotiating team, he said.", "description": "A U.S. Chamber of Commerce official said a limited deal that would prevent President Trump\u2019s planned tariff increase this month and set rules around how China manages its currency could be announced.", "authors": ["Ana Swanson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/business/10dc-trade2/10dc-trade2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
