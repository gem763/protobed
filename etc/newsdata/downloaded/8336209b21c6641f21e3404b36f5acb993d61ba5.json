Liz Cheney., R-Wyo., called the attack on Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman \u201cshameful.\u201d\n\nVindman, who was born in Ukraine and came to the U.S. with his parents at the age of 3, was expected to tell House investigators that he was on the line for Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and was troubled by Trump\u2019s demand for an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen,\u201d Vindman\u2019s prepared opening statement read in part. \u201cAnd I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nOn Fox News Monday night, Laura Ingraham cited a New York Times article, noting that Ukrainian officials sought Vindman\u2019s advice on how to deal with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who was pressing Trump\u2019s demands on Ukraine. Ingraham said she found it \u201cvery interesting\u201d that Vindman, who is fluent in both English and Ukrainian, would sometimes speak to officials in Kiev in their language.\n\n\u201cHere we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House apparently against the president\u2019s interests and usually they spoke in English,\u201d Ingraham said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people might call that espionage,\u201d replied John Yoo, a former deputy assistant U.S. attorney general under President George W. Bush and one of the guests on Ingraham\u2019s show.\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman and President Trump.

Vindman is a soldier, a wounded Iraq War veteran, combat veteran,\u201d Bash said. \u201cHis primary duty of loyalty is to the country, to the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn his opening statement to House investigators, which was first reported by the Times, Vindman said he reported his concerns about the July call to a superior officer.\n\nAppearing on CNN Tuesday morning, former GOP Rep. Sean Duffy, a newly hired contributor to the cable news network, implied that Vindman was acting out of concern for Ukraine\u2019s military requirements. One focus of the House investigation is the allegation by numerous officials that the White House held up military aid to Kiev as a way to enforce Trump\u2019s demand for political help.\n\n\u201cIt seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy, but his main mission was to make sure that the Ukraine got those weapons. I understand it: We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from.\n\n\u201c... He has an affinity, I think, for the Ukraine,\u201d Duffy said of Vindman, who earned a Purple Heart in Iraq. \u201cHe speaks Ukrainian, he came from the country, and he wants to make sure they\u2019re safe and free.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying that Col. Vindman, a decorated war veteran, isn\u2019t looking out for America first?\u201d CNN host John Berman asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Duffy replied.\n\nHelping Ukraine resist aggression by Russia, which occupies part of the country and has been supporting separatist guerrillas, is stated U.S. policy.\n\nCNN's Brianna Keilar absolutely scorches her new colleague Sean Duffy:\n\n\n\n\"That's some anti-immigrant bigotry and it\u2019s odd questioning of patriotism coming from a guy who spent his 20s on MTV's The Real World and the Real World/Road Rules Challenge\" while Vindman served in Iraq pic.twitter.com/dCF7cQ6zgM \u2014 Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) October 29, 2019\n\nCNN's Brianna Keilar later excoriated Duffy for questioning Vindman's patriotism.", "description": "Hours before Army Lt.
