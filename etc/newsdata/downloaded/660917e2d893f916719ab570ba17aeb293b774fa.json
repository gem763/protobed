With a revealing leg slit, and button detailing, the chic dress was the perfect pre-Halloween choice, especially as she coordinated it with matching heels.\n\nStanding in a communal shower (because where else is more appropriate on Halloween weekend?), Jenner captioned her photo, \"showering you with loooooooks \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4 \ud83d\udebf.\"\n\nKylie was filmed walking hand-in-hand with Sofia Richie, as the pair attended a J Balvin concert. Jenner and Richie were also caught on camera swigging tequila from the bottle, and washing it down with a Red Bull chaser.\n\nIn another cute video, Kylie borrowed will.i.am's light-up glasses.\n\nLater in the night, Kylie showcased her first Halloween costume of 2019. Recreating the iconic performance given at the 2003 MTV VMAs, Jenner transformed into Madonna, while Anastasia Karanikolaou became Britney Spears. The pair sang along to \"Like a Virgin,\" and even replicated Britney and Madonna's onstage kiss.\n\nPresumably Kylie is only just getting started, and she'll showcase many more costumes before Halloween is over.\n\nFor more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the Marie Claire newsletter.\n\nsubscribe here\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "She even channeled 'Psycho' by posing in a shower.", "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xwZUIDiGEx8b6hC75JeSTA--~B/aD0yNzE7dz01NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marie_claire_447/eb1878a538b3c469719463398b1c700d", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
