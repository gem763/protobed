No Trick-or-Treat at this address!!\u201d signs in the front yards of over 200 sex offenders registered in the county from Oct. 24-Nov. 2. The sheriff\u2019s office plans to use the same tactic again this year, and three registered sex offenders have filed suit.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Sheriff Gary Long said he had instituted the signs as a result of the cancellation of a local Halloween festival, \u201cHalloween on the Square,\u201d and the subsequent influx of door-to-door trick-or-treaters. He said they had been following Georgia law and protecting children when they implemented the public warnings.\n\n\u201cThe law allows the sheriff to put a list of registered sex offenders at his office, at the courthouse, on the internet,\u201d the lead attorney for the petitioners, Mark Yurachek, told Fox 5 Atlanta. \u201cIt does not allow him to go door-to-door telling people you have a sex offender living next door to you.\u201d\n\nMICHIGAN WOMAN MISSING AFTER TRIP TO REMOTE CABIN, MAKING EARLY-MORNING CALL FOR HELP, POLICE SAY\n\n\"I'm just not sure that this kind of action makes your kids any safer,\" Yurachek said of the initiative. \"It just makes your constitutional rights less safe.\"\n\n\u201cThe trespass stuff is pretty clear. They\u2019re coming onto their property and putting the signs on there,\u201d Yurachek added.\n\nTheir attorney argued that since the Georgis State Sex Offender Registry does not require offenders to post these signs, they shouldn\u2019t be forced by local deputie to have them displayed outside.\n\nBABY WEIGHING LESS THAN 1 POUND GOES HOME FROM NICU NEARLY 5 MONTHS LATER\n\n\u201cThey are individuals who have been brave enough to not be afraid to let the public know that they are registered sex offenders, but are also not willing to tolerate this unlawful action by the sheriff,\u201d said Yurachek. Registrants have no obligation to inform the public of their status, according to the attorney.\n\n\"I understand that there are a lot of people who think this is a great idea, who think 'Yeah this protects my kids, but what they should be thinking about is 'Does this protect my rights?'\" Yuracheck said.\n\nLong said that regardless of the Judge\u2019s ruling on Thursday, he would do everything within the law to protect the community\u2019s children.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOther counties in Georgia also used the \u201cNo Trick-or-Treat\u201d signs, such as Monroe and Lamar counties. In Monroe County, if an offender didn\u2019t want a sign in their yard, they had to wait in the lobby of the local sheriff\u2019s office during trick-or-treat hours on Halloween.", "description": "A group of sex offenders in Georgia is suing the Butts County Sheriff\u2019s office for posting \u201cNo Trick-or-Treat\u201d signs on their homes.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Trick-or-Treat-sign.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
