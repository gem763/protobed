Two other images and a video of him in blackface later emerged.\n\nNow, Mr Scheer is the clear front-runner with as much as a 5-percentage-point lead, according to three different polls conducted after the images were published and released between late Monday and early Tuesday.\n\n\"Right now, the election has become a referendum on Justin Trudeau,\" Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker said in an interview. \"Is he trustworthy? Is he competent?\"\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe old blackface pictures of Trudeau have taken over the campaign narrative ahead of the Oct 21 vote and are \"blotting out the sun,\" Mr Bricker said.\n\nConservatives would win 36 per cent of the vote compared with 32 per cent for the Liberals, the Ipsos poll for Global News showed, while the Angus Reid Institute puts Scheer's party at 35 per cent versus 30 per cent for Trudeau's Liberals. Ekos Politics has the Conservatives at 35.3 per cent and Liberals at 32%.\n\nOn the flip side, the Nanos Research poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail, which is conducted daily, has the Liberals taking back the lead with 35.1 per cent against 33.5 per cent for the Conservatives after a series of policy announcements in recent days.\n\nEkos pollster Frank Graves said the initial dramatic shift in public opinion caused by the scandal had receded, but there were increasing questions about Mr Trudeau's leadership and the race was wide open.\n\n\"The backlash may very well be a product of issues around Mr Trudeau, rather than the blackface episode itself,\" Mr Graves said. \"The race now appears much tighter and less predictable than it did before.\"\n\nMr Trudeau is campaigning in British Columbia on Tuesday and is expected to talk about the environment in a region where his party is battling against the Green Party for several seats.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BURNABY, British Columbia] Canada's Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer has overtaken Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ahead of next month's national election, polls showed on Tuesday, after past images of Trudeau in blackface emerged last week. .
