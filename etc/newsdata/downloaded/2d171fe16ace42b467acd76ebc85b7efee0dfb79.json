Yet as soon as it premiered \u2013 and for every project he did afterwards \u2013 it was talked about as a Charlie Kaufman film, even though it was directed by Spike Jonze, whose work on innovative commercials and videos for Weezer (Buddy Holly), Beastie Boys (Sabotage), and others had earned him a reputation as one of the most sought-after talents in the business. This was virtually unprecedented; even Robert Towne, whose script for Chinatown is frequently cited among the best ever written, wasn\u2019t credited over its director, Roman Polanski.\n\nFight Club at 20: the prescience and power of David Fincher's drama Read more\n\nStill, it was only natural to cite Kaufman for the inspired absurdity of his premise, which treats the very specific consciousness of an esteemed character actor as the site for a grown-up Alice in Wonderland, a place where people can escape their sad, desperate lives for 15 minutes before getting thrown out on to a ditch by the New Jersey Turnpike. It was Kaufman who imagined The Belle of Amherst performed by a 60ft tall Emily Dickinson puppet (\u201cgimmicky bastard\u201d), a workplace conceived for the short-statured on the 7\u00bdth floor of a nondescript office building (\u201cThe overhead is low!\u201d), and 44-year-old humans as vessels for those who want to live forever. And none of that even accounts for the random one-liners and conceits that are jammed into the screenplay, or the emotional richness of its themes, from loneliness to self-loathing to yearning, and how love can transcend bodies and genders.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Spike Jonze and John Malkovich on set.

Through various high-concept, off-the-wall conceits \u2013 a screenwriter named \u201cCharlie Kaufman\u201d struggling to adapt The Orchid Thief (Adaptation), a surgery that erases memories of a failed relationship (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), a theater production that metastasizes like a cancer (Synecdoche, New York), a stop-motion world where everyone is the same (Anomalisa) \u2013 he balances absurdist comedy with insight into specific human vulnerabilities. These enormous and crazily ornate apparatuses are constructed around sentiments that are touchingly precious, like the value of holding on to even painful memories or, in this case, the lengths we\u2019ll go to make ourselves appealing to those we desire.\n\nThe film also introduces the Charlie Kaufman type: pasty and disheveled, with bad hair and lumpen bodies and a thin film of flopsweat on the face. He\u2019s not a hero, either, which is another great and rare quality Kaufman has as a screenwriter. He doesn\u2019t want his characters to be loved; he\u2019ll settle for them being identifiable and understood. To that end, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a self-involved artiste, obsessed with getting some recognition for his uncompromising work as a realist puppeteer, but mostly languishing in a cramped, lightless garden apartment with his wife Lotte (a frizzy-haired Cameron Diaz) and her pet parrot and chimpanzee. Soon after his nimble fingers land him a job as a file clerk at LesterCorp, a company on the 7\u00bdth floor of the Mertin-Flemmer Building in New York, he falls hard for the glamorous Maxine (Catherine Keener), who wants nothing to do with him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Cusack as Craig Schwartz in the film. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto\n\nWhen Craig discovers a hidden portal that leads into the mind of John Malkovich, new possibilities open up for everyone except the hilariously tormented actor, who\u2019s subject to constant insults and the eventual forfeiture of his body. It\u2019s important to note that Maxine never goes into the portal herself \u2013 she\u2019s just happy to run an after-hours business called JM Inc and collect her half of the $200 people will pay for their 15 minutes \u2013 but Craig and Lotte use Malkovich as a separate means to pursue their attraction to her. Lotte experiences some form of transexual awakening, thrilled that she\u2019s finally discovered her true self in seeing Maxine through his body. (\u201cDon\u2019t stand in the way of my actualization as a man!\u201d) Craig, for his part, can manipulate the actor like one of his puppets and be someone that Maxine will accept as a partner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cameron Diaz as Schwartz\u2019s wife Lotte. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/Allstar/Cinetext Collection\n\nBeing John Malkovich is a dense piece of work, as if Kaufman needed his own Malkovichian vessel to serve as a clearing house for ideas that built up over 15 years in the screenwriting wilderness. (Kaufman\u2019s awareness of these tendencies is exposed in Synecdoche, New York.) But one of the pleasures of the film is how multiple viewings bring out different aspects of it: I\u2019ve never heard a group of critics laugh harder than its first screening in Chicago 20 years ago, with a then-full-voiced Roger Ebert bellowing from the back row. It\u2019s perhaps later that something like Lotte\u2019s longing becomes so powerful, or that you lock into the idea of the body and mind as prisons of thwarted desire, or you appreciate Jonze\u2019s directorial touches and his commitment to a modest, grimy aesthetic. On this viewing, it was Malkovich\u2019s own journey that stood out to me, from the various slights directed at him (everyone remembering him from \u201cthat jewel thief movie\u201d, Craig muzzling him as \u201can overrated sack of shit\u201d) to his wonderful comic apoplexy to the particular level of celebrity that would have made him nearly irreplaceable by another star. (\u201cWhat is this strange power Malkovich exudes?\u201d)\n\nOne more 1999 connection stands out: in a deliberately mundane point-of-view sequence in his apartment, Malkovich is ordering periwinkle towels over the phone, recalling the \u201ccornflower blue\u201d that Edward Norton\u2019s narrator singles out in Fight Club from the same year. In both films, there\u2019s something in the air about the meaningless of material things \u2013 even American Beauty, which criminally defeated Being John Malkovich for original screenplay that year, had Kevin Spacey yelling about a couch being \u201cjust a couch\u201d \u2013 and a common longing for a more meaningful life. Norton finds it in violence and machismo while Kaufman\u2019s characters can only find themselves by discarding their old lives, as if Malkovich was the pupa stage in a metamorphosis. For them, being John Malkovich for 15 minutes is better than a lifetime of being themselves.", "description": "One of the most fascinatingly strange and unpredictable films of 1999 still carries with it more pleasures to be discovered", "authors": ["Scott Tobias"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39742bbb967d004ec6d14deba77faadcda9a126/0_883_1889_1133/master/1889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4c60a2c06424fdf2ff468f059bd44d96", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
