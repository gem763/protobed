It so far has been attributed to twelve deaths and 805 confirmed and probable cases in the United States. Most news coverage \u2014 and legislative response \u2014 has focused on nicotine products like Juul, whose CEO recently stepped down amidst these public health concerns, replaced by an executive at Altria, a cigarette empire. Walmart, which will continue to sell cigarettes (and guns), has announced plans to stop selling e-cigarettes, and several states have banned them outright.\n\nBut among the cases confirmed by the CDC thus far, most were attributed to the use of THC cartridges, many of which were purchased on the black market. (Many, if not most, of the cases reported involved patients who used both nicotine and THC, sometimes self-mixed.) Annoyingly, when we say \u201cvaping,\u201d we could be referring to the use of either e-cigarettes or cannabis, thereby conflating the two. As a result, I think, the weed-related part of this story has flown under the radar pretty much everywhere, except cannabis-specific sites like Leafly.\n\nMany marijuana advocacy organizations have warned consumers not to buy THC vape products from unlicensed retailers, but is that really enough? The Cut spoke to a range of experts who study and work with cannabis to determine best practices for cannabis users both casual and frequent in this period of vape-related uncertainty.\n\n\n\nAre we overreacting?\n\nDepends who you ask. Andrew Hathaway, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Guelph in Canada, says it\u2019s reasonable for people (i.e., vapers) to be skeptical about the amount of attention being paid to VAPI. \u201cNot to diminish the tragedy, but when you see this panic [as a result of fewer than] a dozen deaths in a country of 300 million people, that has the markings of a moral panic,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there is some cause to be cynical about that.\u201d\n\nStephen Bright, a senior lecturer on addiction at Edith Cowan University in Australia who specializes in harm reduction, worries that reactive vaping legislation might have unintended consequences. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a moral panic, governments need to be seen as responding in some way because people are concerned, and when they react very quickly, often what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t evidence-based, and it can have unintended negative effects,\u201d he says. In his own research on the Australian government\u2019s reaction to synthetic cannabis products, Bright found that banning products outright sometimes resulted in newer, less-understood psychoactive products entering the market. He likens the outright ban like those increasingly seen in the U.S. as using \u201ca sledgehammer on a nail.\u201d A more effective approach is to apply stringent regulations, says Bright.\n\nAre weed pens as dangerous as vaping nicotine?\n\nIn short \u2014 yes, potentially. Vaping THC oil has become a popular alternative to smoking weed in recent years, largely due to the product\u2019s convenience, lack of odor, and potency. Just as Juul likely captured segments of the otherwise non-smoking market, weed pens are especially attractive to marijuana newcomers. \u201cIt gave people who weren\u2019t your committed chronic pot smokers \u2014 your soccer moms, your grandmas \u2014 a way to enjoy the benefits of cannabis consumption without the fear of smoke-related harm,\u201d says Hathaway. And much like Juul has been promoted as being inherently safer than smoking cigarettes, advertising for liquid cannabis cartridges tends to promote their ability to deliver a \u201ccleaner\u201d high.\n\nBut liquid cannabis cartridges are a relatively new and unstudied product, and their regulation criteria are irregular state to state. Though most of the cartridges identified by the CDC have been purchased illegally (many under the brand name \u201cDank Vapes\u201d), doctors working in medicinal cannabis express concerns about legal cartridges as well. Erick Kaufman is a cannabis doctor working in Oklahoma, where legal medical marijuana is less than a year old. \u201cIn Oklahoma, all you have to have is $2500 and be 25 years of age, and you can get a license to open your own dispensary,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have over a thousand dispensaries. A lot of the people who\u2019ve gotten into this business are people who were slinging weed illegally in the past and are now doing it legally, and they can source their product from anybody that they want.\u201d\n\nKaufman worries that lax regulation will allow sellers to prioritize profit over safety, particular in vaping products. \u201cGetting THC distillate is not hard at all,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively inexpensive to do a hydrocarbon extraction for THC, and there\u2019s such a profit to be made that I think it\u2019s the Wild Wild West.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Kaufman\u2019s concern is not for the THC itself, but what it\u2019s mixed with. Vitamin E acetate, commonly used as a thickening agent with THC oil on the black market, has been highlighted as a common denominator among a number of VAPI cases. And while legal dispensaries in certain states are required to test their products for pesticides and other contaminants, Vitamin E isn\u2019t among them \u2014 though some labs have voluntarily begun adding it to their roster of tests. Among them is BelCosta Labs, a cannabis-testing lab in California. \u201cThere\u2019s a slew of other solvents and other things we do look at, but this one wasn\u2019t on the list, which is probably why people were using it,\u201d says CEO Myron Ronay. The whack-a-mole nature of lab testing (among the few states that even require it) leaves open the possibility that new chemicals will simply be substituted for those added to a lab\u2019s roster of tests. And while Ronay says that \u201cmost\u201d legal dispensaries in California don\u2019t use cutting or thickening agents in their THC cartridges, he can\u2019t guarantee none do. \u201cStates need to have a process for testing for pesticides and solvents and cutting agents,\u201d says Ronay. \u201cAnd individual brand owners [need to] show they\u2019re not using cutting agents.\u201d\n\nWhile some vape cartridge brands have been eager to distance their products from VAPI, most have continued business as usual, often with little to no substantive proof behind claims that their products are safe \u2014 a difficult claim for any company to make truthfully, given the lack of regulation nationwide.\n\nIs vaping CBD safer than vaping THC?\n\nNo, and some experts worry it might be more dangerous. Though CBD is a non-psychoactive component of cannabis, and much more readily available than THC, its regulation is even more erratic. \u201cI\u2019ve got major concerns about the health and safety of the public using CBD products because there are no regulations,\u201d says Ronay. \u201cIn most places, e-cigarettes and legal cannabis have some, but CBD has zero. It\u2019s scary that people don\u2019t know what\u2019s in CBD.\u201d\n\nBecause CBD is currently marketed as a kind of \u201cvitamin\u201d in the wellness world, companies can say it\u2019s in just about anything, from coffee to leggings. In the best-case scenario, the CBD advertised in a product won\u2019t do much of anything, but in the worst cases, Ronay worries there\u2019s significant opportunity to introduce undisclosed chemical agents, in part because the claims made around its effects are so nebulous. Bright agrees. \u201cIn the U.S., particularly with CBD products, there\u2019s not enough regulation,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Australia, CBD is a schedule 8 drug, so it\u2019d be like a schedule 2 drug in the U.S. You can\u2019t just go into a 7-11 and buy it.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s the safest way to consume marijuana?\n\nAll but the most committed stoners agree that marijuana is never entirely without risk \u2014 though, importantly, many researchers also believe marijuana is safer than both cigarettes and alcohol. If vaping THC oil is, for the time being at least, an unsafe and unwise method of cannabis consumption, what\u2019s the best alternative?\n\nRadhika Ratnabalasuriar, an emergency-medicine physician and medical-marijuana practitioner who goes by \u201cDr. Rad,\u201d recommends her patients use edibles and/or tinctures as their first line of consumption, and smoking second. \u201cPrior to vaping-related lung injuries, we still knew there was a risk of recurrent bronchitis and laryngitis [with smoking weed], but we also found that when people stopped inhaling, that lung damage was usually reversible, and these were mild cases,\u201d says Dr. Rad. Edibles and tinctures avoid that risk altogether, she says.\n\n\u201cWhen you eat something, it\u2019s going through that slower metabolism, and that\u2019s why it takes 60\u2013120 minutes to kick in, but you\u2019re not getting that direct exposure to your lungs.\u201d While Dr. Rad acknowledges that it can be hard for patients to wait (and hard to predict how much to take), the effects are longer-lasting, and she likes to avoid the risk to patients\u2019 lungs.\n\nFor those who prefer the immediacy of smoking, but still want to spare their lungs as much as possible, Kaufman recommends a dry herb vaporizer, like the Aegis or similar. (There are a lot of these devices out there, and virtually all of them are coyly marketed as being intended for \u201cground material.\u201d They mean pot.) These devices operate like little ovens, allowing users to avoid combustion and the resulting smoke. And because you\u2019re using the actual plant, you\u2019re getting all the benefits it has to offer.\n\n\u201cThe actual cannabis plant has 100 different active ingredients that work together in what we call the entourage effect, and when somebody isolates THC and sells it to you, you\u2019re missing out on a lot of the really helpful compounds that come from the flower,\u201d says Kaufman. \u201cUnless you just want to get stupid high and see things and get paranoid, why mess with it?\u201d", "description": "Experts on cannabis talk about VAPI, vaping-associated pulmonary illness, and the risks inherent to THC oil cartridges, which remain poorly regulated.", "authors": ["Katie Heaney"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/26/26-vaping-pen.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
