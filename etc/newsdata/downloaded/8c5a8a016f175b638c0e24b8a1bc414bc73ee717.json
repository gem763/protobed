(Kin Cheung/AP)\n\nThe 15-year-old student woke Monday morning, donned his school uniform of white shirt and blue pants, and left the Hong Kong apartment he shares with his parents and grandparents.\n\nBut he had no intention of heading to school. He was among the thousands of students boycotting the first day of classes after a summer of sustained protests that have been fueled largely by teenagers like him.\n\n\u201cMy grandparents don\u2019t agree with me, so I had to pretend,\u201d the student, who wanted to be known only by his last name Wu, said at a rally in central Hong Kong he was attending instead of being in class. \u201cI put on my uniform like I was going to school, but came here instead.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government had been hoping that once school started, the tensions \u2014 and occasional violence \u2014 that have played out weekend after weekend on the city\u2019s streets would subside.\n\nStudents on Monday, however, hoped to send a clear message that they are not going anywhere and plan to continue to be the backbone of dissent against their government, the city\u2019s police force and Beijing\u2019s influence on their semiautonomous territory.\n\nStudents plan to \u201cescalate\u201d their actions if the government doesn\u2019t meet their demands \u2014 raising the specter of even more unrest as Hong Kong\u2019s police force cracks down harder on protests and the city\u2019s government remains unwavering in its refusal to compromise.\n\n\u201cThings will not just go back to normal just like that,\u201d said one 17-year-old student who gave only his last name, Chan. \u201cIf the government does not respond to our demands, there is no way this will stop.\u201d\n\nProtests have grown in intensity since June, originally sparked by plans to allow extraditions to mainland China. The past weekend saw some of the worst violence on city streets in months, with unprecedented police use of force and huge fires set by protesters. The crisis has unearthed deep grievances in Hong Kong, the most fundamental being the fear that Beijing wants to erode the city\u2019s freedoms and cultural uniqueness.\n\nChinese state media, meanwhile, have continued to escalate their rhetoric. The state-owned Xinhua News Agency said in an editorial that the \u201cend is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonize China.\u201d\n\n\n\nA deep rift has also been created between police and citizens as harsher tactics are being used to discourage the protests.\n\n\n\nThousands of students gather during a strike on the first day of school at the Chinese University in Hong Kong on Monday. (Vincent Yu/AP)\n\nOutside the gates of several high schools across the city on Monday morning, students and alumni in black surgical masks, helmets and respirators linked hands in protest. At St. Francis\u2019 Canossian College, an all-girls high school that counts Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam as one of its graduates, students held up signs that read: \u201cChief Executive, will you listen to the voices of the younger sisters from your school?\u201d\n\n[Protesters focus on Hong Kong\u2019s airport, snarling transport links after day of violence ]\n\nAt Queen\u2019s College, students placed a hard hat, goggles and a respirator on a statue of Sun Yat-sen, known as the founder of modern China and the all-boys high school\u2019s most distinguished alumnus.\n\nIn a news conference Tuesday, Hong Kong Education Secretary Kevin Yeung said schools \u201cshould not be used as places for raising political demands or trying to exercise pressure on the government on political issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would like to keep schools as a calm, peaceful and orderly place for students to study,\u201d he added.\n\nLater in the afternoon, tens of thousands attended a rally at the Chinese University of Hong Kong despite a warning from school authorities that their gathering was \u201crisky\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be held. Students packed the center of campus and draped black banners on university buildings, including one reading \u201cFight for Freedom.\u201d\n\nChants of \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\u201d thundered across the campus, at times completely drowning out the speakers addressing the enormous crowd.\n\nUniversities in Hong Kong \u2014 which up until this point in the protests have been in summer recess \u2014 are expected to be the new battleground for tensions between mainland Chinese and Hong Kongers.\n\nAlready there have been clashes on college campuses in Australia and elsewhere in the world between those supporting the Hong Kong protests and those backing Beijing\u2019s stance.\n\nStudents from the mainland make up a huge chunk of university students in Hong Kong, and many of them cannot understand why the local students are taking to the street.\n\nBefore the rally at Chinese University, one mainland Chinese student ripped up a protest banner and yelled that he supported the Hong Kong police. \u201cStudents should study, not strike!\u201d he screamed, according to a witness.\n\n\n\nStudents wearing gas masks and helmets hold a banner that reads \u201cFive major demands are indispensable,\u201d at St. Francis' Canossian College in Hong Kong, on Monday. (AP)\n\nAlmost all of the dozen or so students interviewed by The Washington Post mentioned police attacks and their use of force as a key reason for their continued participation in protests and Monday\u2019s boycotts.\n\nOn Saturday, police stormed subway trains and swung their batons and shot pepper spray at protesters and ordinary citizens cowering in the carriages. Police said they were responding to \u201cviolent acts\u201d and vandalism in the stations.\n\nPolice made 159 arrests between Friday and Sunday, they said in a news conference, including at the subway stations. Almost a thousand people have been arrested on charges relating to the protests since June, including dozens on harsh riot charges.\n\n\u201cMy heart is broken from the police brutality,\u201d said Jerry Liu, a 15-year-old student also boycotting class. \u201cSkipping school is nothing compared to our brothers and sisters who dare to go out and fight . . . for our freedoms.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe school boycotts coincided with a call for a general strike on Monday and an effort to once again disrupt transportation networks in Hong Kong. The plans however appeared to have limited effect, as officers in riot gear waited at subway stations to arrest anyone who tried to hold doors open. Officers made eight more arrests on Monday morning.\n\nAbout 40,000 people joined a rally to mark the strike in Tamar Park, near the Legislative Council building. Some protesters later gathered around government buildings close to a police cordon and were pushed back with pepper spray.\n\nPolice also stopped and searched students outside high schools around the city. Officers stopped alumni who were handing out pamphlets and brochures in support of protests outside their high schools, and searched their backpacks.\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid, these are just scare tactics,\u201d said Isaac Cheng, a 19-year-old university student who helped organize a rally for secondary school students. \u201cIn our fight for freedom and our fight for democracy, we must overcome our fear.\u201d\n\nTiffany Liang and Timothy McLaughlin contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nHong Kong protesters defy ban as clashes escalate on key pro-democracy anniversary\n\nWith Hong Kong in turmoil, questions grow over leader\u2019s refusal to offer concessions to protesters\n\nFive lives in Hong Kong: Stories of foment, fear and struggle that converge on the streets\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The government has been hoping summer\u2019s end would ease the tensions that have rocked the city for months, but students say they will not quit.", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "Anna Kam", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_Q5teh76Hg8mVYtnxA6v3mcjkq4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SYDSPOWNMMI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
