Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) were just three of 10 candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination on stage in Houston on Thursday night.\n\nBut once they got past opening statements, seven candidates stood silent, as the current frontrunners debated the future of the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nBiden, who has held steady at the top of the polls since his entrance into the race in April, hesitated for a moment before launching into not-so-subtle attacks on Warren and Sanders. But when asked about his plan to build on the Affordable Care Act, former President Obama\u2019s signature health care policy, Biden took the opportunity to criticize both his progressive rivals, who have been inching up on his lead for several months.\n\n\u201cIt costs $740 billion. It doesn't cost $30 trillion,\u201d Biden said before launching into Warren. \u201cHow are we going to pay for it? I want to hear that tonight. My distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it and the senator has, in fact, come forward and said how he's going to pay for it, but it gets him halfway there. There's a lot of things that need to be done.\u201d\n\nWarren, who evoked Obama\u2019s name in her own response, fired back.\n\n\u201cThe question is, how best can we improve on it?\u201d Warren said about fixing the country\u2019s health care system. \u201cI believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by health care at the lowest possible cost. How do we pay for it? We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more. and middle class families are going to pay less. that's how this is going to work,\u201d she said.\n\nBiden-world spent the week laying the groundwork for their boss\u2019s line of attacks the ABC debate. In a briefing with reporters on Thursday afternoon, three senior campaign officials previewed a strategy seemingly tailored to draw contrasts between the former vice president and his two liberal rivals in the field\u2019s top tier.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need more than just plans\u2014we need action,\u201d said one official, echoed moments later by a colleague: \u201cPlans are great, but you have to get things done.\u201d\n\nWhile the officials didn\u2019t explicitly name Warren, the implication was clear that Biden sees the senator\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan for that\u201d moniker as heavy on policy and light on the kind of hard accomplishments that the former six-term senator can boast.\n\n\u201cThis race is not just about plans, it\u2019s about getting things done for people,\u201d one official said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between talking about change and getting it done\u201d\n\nSanders, whose Medicare-for-All plan has been a hallmark of his candidacy, didn\u2019t miss a chance to dig into the current frontrunner.\n\n\u201cLet us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we have spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\u201cThis is America,\u201d Biden plainly replied.", "description": "The former vice president took shots at Warren and Sanders on health care.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo", "Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568335914/190912-Trudo-healthcare-tease_vgtppw", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
