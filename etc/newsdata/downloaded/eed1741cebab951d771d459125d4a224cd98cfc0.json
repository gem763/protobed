That pursuit required more effort back then, when nothing was streaming and everything had to be hunted down, bought or borrowed. But those changes aren\u2019t what this essay is about. Culturally ravenous young people have always been insufferable and never unusual, even though they tend to invest a lot in being different \u2014 in aspiring (or pretending) to something deeper, higher than the common run. Viewed with the chastened hindsight of adulthood, their seriousness shows its ridiculous side, but the longing that drives it is no joke. It\u2019s a hunger not so much for knowledge as for experience of a particular kind. Two kinds, really: the specific experience of encountering a book or work of art and also the future experience, the state of perfectly cultivated being, that awaits you at the end of the search. Once you\u2019ve read everything, then at last you can begin.\n\n2 Furious consumption is often described as indiscriminate, but the point of it is always discrimination. It was on my parents\u2019 bookshelves, amid other emblems of midcentury, middle-class American literary taste and intellectual curiosity, that I found a book with a title that seemed to offer something I desperately needed, even if (or precisely because) it went completely over my head. \u201cAgainst Interpretation.\u201d No subtitle, no how-to promise or self-help come-on. A 95-cent Dell paperback with a front-cover photograph of the author, Susan Sontag.\n\nThere is no doubt that the picture was part of the book\u2019s allure \u2014 the angled, dark-eyed gaze, the knowing smile, the bobbed hair and buttoned-up coat \u2014 but the charisma of the title shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. It was a statement of opposition, though I couldn\u2019t say what exactly was being opposed. Whatever \u201cinterpretation\u201d turned out to be, I was ready to enlist in the fight against it. I still am, even if interpretation, in one form or another, has been the main way I\u2019ve made my living as an adult. It\u2019s not fair to blame Susan Sontag for that, though I do.\n\n3 \u201cAgainst Interpretation,\u201d a collection of articles from the 1960s reprinted from various journals and magazines, mainly devoted to of-the-moment texts and artifacts (Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s \u201cSaint Genet,\u201d Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cVivre Sa Vie,\u2019\u2019 Jack Smith\u2019s \u201cFlaming Creatures\u201d), modestly presents itself as \u201ccase studies for an aesthetic,\u201d a theory of Sontag\u2019s \u201cown sensibility.\u201d Really, though, it is the episodic chronicle of a mind in passionate struggle with the world and itself.\n\nSontag\u2019s signature is ambivalence. \u201cAgainst Interpretation\u201d (the essay), which declares that \u201cto interpret is to impoverish, to deplete the world \u2014 in order to set up a shadow world of \u2018meanings,\u2019 \u201d is clearly the work of a relentlessly analytical, meaning-driven intelligence. In a little more than 10 pages, she advances an appeal to the ecstasy of surrender rather than the protocols of exegesis, made in unstintingly cerebral terms. Her final, mic-drop declaration \u2014 \u201cIn place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art\u201d \u2014 deploys abstraction in the service of carnality.\n\n\u201cWriter Susan Sontag with her son, David, N.Y.C. 1965.\u201d Photograph by Diane Arbus\n\n4 It\u2019s hard for me, after so many years, to account for the impact \u201cAgainst Interpretation\u201d had on me. It was first published in 1966, the year of my birth, which struck me as terribly portentous. It brought news about books I hadn\u2019t \u2014 hadn\u2019t yet! \u2014 read and movies I hadn\u2019t heard about and challenged pieties I had only begun to comprehend. It breathed the air of the \u201960s, a momentous time I had unforgivably missed.\n\nBut I kept reading \u201cAgainst Interpretation\u201d \u2014 following it with \u201cStyles of Radical Will,\u201d \u201cOn Photography\u201d and \u201cUnder the Sign of Saturn,\u201d books Sontag would later deprecate as \u201cjuvenilia\u201d \u2014 for something else. For the style, you could say (she wrote an essay called \u201cOn Style\u201d). For the voice, I guess, but that\u2019s a tame, trite word. It was because I craved the drama of her ambivalence, the tenacity of her enthusiasm, the sting of her doubt. I read those books because I needed to be with her. Is it too much to say that I was in love with her? Who was she, anyway?\n\n5 Years after I plucked \u201cAgainst Interpretation\u201d from the living-room shelf, I came across a short story of Sontag\u2019s called \u201cPilgrimage.\u201d One of the very few overtly autobiographical pieces Sontag ever wrote, this lightly fictionalized memoir, set in Southern California in 1947, recalls an adolescence that I somehow suspect myself of having plagiarized a third of a century later. \u201cI felt I was slumming in my own life,\u201d Sontag writes, gently mocking and also proudly affirming the serious, voracious girl she used to be. The \u201cpilgrimage\u201d in question, undertaken with a friend named Merrill, was to Thomas Mann\u2019s house in Pacific Palisades, where that venerable giant of German Kultur had been incongruously living while in exile from Nazi Germany.\n\nThe funniest and truest part of the story is young Susan\u2019s \u201cshame and dread\u201d at the prospect of paying the call. \u201cOh, Merrill, how could you?\u201d she melodramatically exclaims when she learns he has arranged for a teatime visit to the Mann residence. The second-funniest and truest part of the story is the disappointment Susan tries to fight off in the presence of a literary idol who talks \u201clike a book review.\u201d The encounter makes a charming anecdote with 40 years of hindsight, but it also proves that the youthful instincts were correct. \u201cWhy would I want to meet him?\u201d she wondered. \u201cI had his books.\u201d\n\n6 I never met Susan Sontag. Once when I was working late answering phones and manning the fax machine in the offices of The New York Review of Books, I took a message for Robert Silvers, one of the magazine\u2019s editors. \u201cTell him Susan Sontag called. He\u2019ll know why.\u201d (Because it was his birthday.) Another time I caught a glimpse of her sweeping, swanning, promenading \u2014 or maybe just walking \u2014 through the galleries of the Frick.\n\nMuch later, I was commissioned by this magazine to write a profile of her. She was about to publish \u201cRegarding the Pain of Others,\u201d a sequel and corrective to her 1977 book \u201cOn Photography.\u201d The furor she sparked with a few paragraphs written for The New Yorker after the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 words that seemed obnoxiously rational at a time of horror and grief \u2014 had not yet died down. I felt I had a lot to say to her, but the one thing I could not bring myself to do was pick up the phone. Mostly I was terrified of disappointment, mine and hers. I didn\u2019t want to fail to impress her; I didn\u2019t want to have to try. The terror of seeking her approval, and the certainty that in spite of my journalistic pose I would be doing just that, were paralyzing. Instead of a profile, I wrote a short text that accompanied a portrait by Chuck Close. I didn\u2019t want to risk knowing her in any way that might undermine or complicate the relationship we already had, which was plenty fraught. I had her books.\n\n7 After Sontag died in 2004, the focus of attention began to drift away from her work and toward her person. Not her life so much as her self, her photographic image, her way of being at home and at parties \u2014 anywhere but on the page. Her son, David Rieff, wrote a piercing memoir about his mother\u2019s illness and death. Annie Leibovitz, Sontag\u2019s partner, off and on, from 1989 until her death, released a portfolio of photographs unsparing in their depiction of her cancer-ravaged, 70-year-old body. There were ruminations by Wayne Koestenbaum, Phillip Lopate and Terry Castle about her daunting reputation and the awe, envy and inadequacy she inspired in them. \u201cSempre Susan,\u201d a short memoir by Sigrid Nunez, who lived with Sontag and Rieff for a while in the 1970s, is the masterpiece of the \u201cI knew Susan\u201d minigenre and a funhouse-mirror companion to Sontag\u2019s own \u201cPilgrimage.\u201d It\u2019s about what can happen when you really get to know a writer, which is that you lose all sense of what or who it is you really know, including yourself.\n\n8 In 2008, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Sontag\u2019s longtime publisher, issued \u201cReborn,\u201d the first of two volumes so far culled from nearly 100 notebooks Sontag filled from early adolescence into late middle age. Because of their fragmentary nature, these journal entries aren\u2019t intimidating in the way her more formal nonfiction prose could be, or abstruse in the manner of most of her pre-1990s fiction. They seem to offer an unobstructed window into her mind, documenting her intellectual anxieties, existential worries and emotional upheavals, along with everyday ephemera that proves to be almost as captivating. Lists of books to be read and films to be seen sit alongside quotations, aphorisms, observations and story ideas. Lovers are tantalizingly represented by a single letter (\u201cI.\u201d; \u201cH\u201d; \u201cC.\u201d). You wonder if Sontag hoped, if she knew, that you would be reading this someday \u2014 the intimate journal as a literary form is a recurring theme in her essays \u2014 and you wonder whether that possibility undermines the guilty intimacy of reading these pages or, on the contrary, accounts for it.\n\n9 A new biography by Benjamin Moser \u2014 \u201cSontag: Her Life and Work,\u201d published last month \u2014 shrinks Sontag down to life size, even as it also insists on her significance. \u201cWhat mattered about Susan Sontag was what she symbolized,\u201d he concludes, having studiously documented her love affairs, her petty cruelties and her lapses in personal hygiene.\n\nI must say I find the notion horrifying. A woman whose great accomplishments were writing millions of words and reading who knows how many millions more \u2014 no exercise in Sontagiana can fail to mention the 15,000-book library in her Chelsea apartment \u2014 has at last been decisively captured by what she called \u201cthe image-world,\u201d the counterfeit reality that threatens to destroy our apprehension of the actual world.\n\nYou can argue about the philosophical coherence, the political implications or the present-day relevance of this idea (one of the central claims of \u201cOn Photography\u201d), but it\u2019s hard to deny that Sontag currently belongs more to images than to words. Maybe it\u2019s inevitable that after Sontag\u2019s death, the literary persona she spent a lifetime constructing \u2014 that rigorous, serious, impersonal self \u2014 has been peeled away, revealing the person hiding behind the words. The unhappy daughter. The mercurial mother. The variously needy and domineering lover. The loyal, sometimes impossible friend. In the era of prestige TV, we may have lost our appetite for difficult books, but we relish difficult characters, and the biographical Sontag \u2014 brave and imperious, insecure and unpredictable \u2014 surely fits the bill.\n\n10 \u201cInterpretation,\u201d according to Sontag, \u201cis the revenge of the intellect upon art. Even more. It is the revenge of the intellect upon the world.\u201d And biography, by the same measure, is the revenge of research upon the intellect. The life of the mind is turned into \u201cthe life,\u201d a coffin full of rattling facts and spectral suppositions, less an invitation to read or reread than a handy, bulky excuse not to.\n\nThe point of this essay, which turns out not to be as simple as I thought it would be, is to resist that tendency. I can\u2019t deny the reality of the image or the symbolic cachet of the name. I don\u2019t want to devalue the ways Sontag serves as a talisman and a culture hero. All I really want to say is that Susan Sontag mattered because of what she wrote.\n\n11 Or maybe I should just say that\u2019s why she matters to me. In \u201cSempre Susan,\u201d Sigrid Nunez describes Sontag as:\n\n... the opposite of Thomas Bernhard\u2019s comic \u201cpossessive thinker,\u201d who feeds on the fantasy that every book or painting or piece of music he loves has been created solely for and belongs solely to him, and whose \u201cart selfishness\u201d makes the thought of anyone else enjoying or appreciating the works of genius he reveres intolerable. She wanted her passions to be shared by all, and to respond with equal intensity to any work she loved was to give her one of her biggest pleasures.\n\nI\u2019m the opposite of that. I don\u2019t like to share my passions, even if the job of movie critic forces me to do it. I cling to an immature (and maybe also a typically male), proprietary investment in the work I care about most. My devotion to Sontag has often felt like a secret. She was never assigned in any course I took in college, and if her name ever came up while I was in graduate school, it was with a certain condescension. She wasn\u2019t a theorist or a scholar but an essayist and a popularizer, and as such a bad fit with the desperate careerism that dominated the academy at the time. In the world of cultural journalism, she\u2019s often dismissed as an egghead and a snob. Not really worth talking about, and so I mostly didn\u2019t talk about her.\n\n12 Nonetheless, I kept reading, with an ambivalence that mirrored hers. Perhaps her most famous essay \u2014 certainly among the most controversial \u2014 is \u201cNotes on \u2018Camp,\u2019 \u201d which scrutinizes a phenomenon defined by \u201cthe spirit of extravagance\u201d with scrupulous sobriety. The inquiry proceeds from mixed feelings \u2014 \u201cI am strongly drawn to Camp, and almost as strongly offended by it\u201d \u2014 that are heightened rather than resolved, and that curl through the 58 numbered sections of the \u201cNotes\u201d like tendrils in an Art Nouveau print. In writing about a mode of expression that is overwrought, artificial, frivolous and theatrical, Sontag adopts a style that is the antithesis of all those things.\n\nIf some kinds of camp represent \u201ca seriousness that fails,\u201d then \u201cNotes on \u2018Camp\u2019 \u201d enacts a seriousness that succeeds. The essay is dedicated to Oscar Wilde, whose most tongue-in-cheek utterances gave voice to his deepest thoughts. Sontag reverses that Wildean current, so that her grave pronouncements sparkle with an almost invisible mischief. The essay is delightful because it seems to betray no sense of fun at all, because its jokes are buried so deep that they are, in effect, secrets.\n\n13 In the chapter of \u201cAgainst Interpretation\u201d called \u201cCamus\u2019 Notebooks\u201d \u2014 originally published in The New York Review of Books \u2014 Sontag divides great writers into \u201chusbands\u201d and \u201clovers,\u201d a sly, sexy updating of older dichotomies (e.g., between Apollonian and Dionysian, Classical and Romantic, paleface and redskin). Albert Camus, at the time beginning his posthumous descent from Nobel laureate and existentialist martyr into the high school curriculum (which is where I found him), is named the \u201cideal husband of contemporary letters.\u201d It isn\u2019t really a compliment:\n\nSome writers supply the solid virtues of a husband: reliability, intelligibility, generosity, decency. There are other writers in whom one prizes the gifts of a lover, gifts of temperament rather than of moral goodness. Notoriously, women tolerate qualities in a lover \u2014 moodiness, selfishness, unreliability, brutality \u2014 that they would never countenance in a husband, in return for excitement, an infusion of intense feeling. In the same way, readers put up with unintelligibility, obsessiveness, painful truths, lies, bad grammar \u2014 if, in compensation, the writer allows them to savor rare emotions and dangerous sensations.\n\nThe sexual politics of this formulation are quite something. Reading is female, writing male. The lady reader exists to be seduced or provided for, ravished or served, by a man who is either a scamp or a solid citizen. Camus, in spite of his movie-star good looks (like Sontag, he photographed well), is condemned to husband status. He\u2019s the guy the reader will settle for, who won\u2019t ask too many questions when she returns from her flings with Kafka, C\u00e9line or Gide. He\u2019s also the one who, more than any of them, inspires love.\n\n14 After her marriage to the sociologist Philip Rieff ended in 1959, most of Sontag\u2019s serious romantic relationships were with women. The writers whose company she kept on the page were overwhelmingly male (and almost exclusively European). Except for a short piece about Simone Weil and another about Nathalie Sarraute in \u201cAgainst Interpretation\u201d and an extensive takedown of Leni Riefenstahl in \u201cUnder the Sign of Saturn,\u201d Sontag\u2019s major criticism is all about men.\n\nShe herself was kind of a husband. Her writing is conscientious, thorough, patient and useful. Authoritative but not scolding. Rigorous, orderly and lucid even when venturing into landscapes of wildness, disruption and revolt. She begins her inquiry into \u201cThe Pornographic Imagination\u201d with the warning that \u201cNo one should undertake a discussion of pornography before acknowledging the pornographies \u2014 there are at least three \u2014 and before pledging to take them on one at a time.\u201d\n\nSontag in Paris in October 1995. Her book \u201cUnder the Sign of Saturn\u201d begins in a \u201ctiny room in Paris,\u201d which may represent her solitary consciousness. G\u00e9rard Rondeau/Agence VU/Redux\n\nThe extravagant, self-subverting seriousness of this sentence makes it a perfect camp gesture. There is also something kinky about the setting of rules and procedures, an implied scenario of transgression and punishment that is unmistakably erotic. Should I be ashamed of myself for thinking that? Of course! Humiliation is one of the most intense and pleasurable effects of Sontag\u2019s masterful prose. She\u2019s the one in charge.\n\n15 But the rules of the game don\u2019t simply dictate silence or obedience on the reader\u2019s part. What sustains the bond \u2014 the bondage, if you\u2019ll allow it \u2014 is its volatility. The dominant party is always vulnerable, the submissive party always capable of rebellion, resistance or outright refusal.\n\nI often read her work in a spirit of defiance, of disobedience, as if hoping to provoke a reaction. For a while, I thought she was wrong about everything. \u201cAgainst Interpretation\u201d was a sentimental and self-defeating polemic against criticism, the very thing she had taught me to believe in. \u201cOn Photography\u201d was a sentimental defense of a shopworn aesthetic ideology wrapped around a superstitious horror at technology. And who cared about Elias Canetti and Walter Benjamin anyway? Or about E.M. Cioran or Antonin Artaud or any of the other Euro-weirdos in her pantheon?\n\nNot me! And yet. ... Over the years I\u2019ve purchased at least three copies of \u201cUnder the Sign of Saturn\u201d \u2014 if pressed to choose a favorite Sontag volume, I\u2019d pick that one \u2014 and in each the essay on Canetti, \u201cMind as Passion,\u201d is the most dog-eared. Why? Not so I could recommend it to someone eager to learn about the first native Bulgarian to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, because I\u2019ve never met such a person. \u201cMind as Passion\u201d is the best thing I\u2019ve ever read about the emotional dynamics of literary admiration, about the way a great writer \u201cteaches us how to breathe,\u201d about how readerly surrender is a form of self-creation.\n\n16 In a very few cases, the people Sontag wrote about were people she knew: Roland Barthes and Paul Goodman, for example, whose deaths inspired brief appreciations reprinted in \u201cUnder the Sign of Saturn.\u201d Even in those elegies, the primary intimacy recorded is the one between writer and reader, and the reader \u2014 who is also, of course, a writer \u2014 is commemorating and pursuing a form of knowledge that lies somewhere between the cerebral and the biblical.\n\nBecause the intimacy is extended to Sontag\u2019s reader, the love story becomes an implicit m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. Each essay enacts the effort \u2014 the dialectic of struggle, doubt, ecstasy and letdown \u2014 to know another writer, and to make you know him, too. And, more deeply though also more discreetly, to know her.\n\n17 The version of this essay that I least want to write \u2014 the one that keeps pushing against my resistance to it \u2014 is the one that uses Sontag as a cudgel against the intellectual deficiencies and the deficient intellectuals of the present. It\u2019s almost comically easy to plot a vector of decline from then to now. Why aren\u2019t the kids reading Canetti? Why don\u2019t trade publishers print collections of essays about European writers and avant-garde filmmakers? Sontag herself was not immune to such laments. In 1995, she mourned the death of cinema. In 1996, she worried that \u201cthe very idea of the serious (and the honorable) seems quaint, \u2018unrealistic\u2019 to most people.\u201d\n\nWorse, there are ideas and assumptions abroad in the digital land that look like debased, parodic versions of positions she staked out half a century ago. The \u201cnew sensibility\u201d she heralded in the \u201960s, \u201cdedicated both to an excruciating seriousness and to fun and wit and nostalgia,\u201d survives in the form of a frantic, algorithm-fueled eclecticism. The popular meme admonishing critics and other designated haters to shut up and \u201clet people enjoy things\u201d looks like an emoji-friendly update of \u201cAgainst Interpretation,\u201d with \u201cenjoy things\u201d a safer formulation than Sontag\u2019s \u201cerotics of art.\u201d\n\nThat isn\u2019t what she meant, any more than her prickly, nuanced \u201cNotes on \u2018Camp\u2019 \u201d had much to do with the Instagram-ready insouciance of this year\u2019s Met Gala, which borrowed the title for its theme. And speaking of the \u2019Gram, its ascendance seems to confirm the direst prophecies of \u201cOn Photography,\u201d which saw the unchecked spread of visual media as a kind of ecological catastrophe for human consciousness.\n\n18 In other ways, the Sontag of the \u201960s and \u201970s can strike current sensibilities as problematic or outlandish. She wrote almost exclusively about white men. She believed in fixed hierarchies and absolute standards. She wrote at daunting length with the kind of unapologetic erudition that makes people feel bad. Even at her most polemical, she never trafficked in contrarian hot takes. Her name will never be the answer to the standard, time-killing social-media query \u201cWhat classic writer would be awesome on Twitter?\u201d The tl;dr of any Sontag essay could only be every word of it.\n\nSontag was a queer, Jewish woman writer who disdained the rhetoric of identity. She was diffident about disclosing her sexuality. Moser criticizes her for not coming out in the worst years of the AIDS epidemic, when doing so might have been a powerful political statement. The political statements that she did make tended to get her into trouble. In 1966, she wrote that \u201cthe white race is the cancer of human history.\u201d In 1982, in a speech at Town Hall in Manhattan, she called communism \u201cfascism with a human face.\u201d After Sept. 11, she cautioned against letting emotion cloud political judgment. \u201cLet\u2019s by all means grieve together, but let\u2019s not be stupid together.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound so unreasonable now, but the bulk of Sontag\u2019s writing served no overt or implicit ideological agenda. Her agenda \u2014 a list of problems to be tackled rather than a roster of positions to be taken \u2014 was stubbornly aesthetic. And that may be the most unfashionable, the most shocking, the most infuriating thing about her.\n\n19 Right now, at what can feel like a time of moral and political emergency, we cling to sentimental bromides about the importance of art. We treat it as an escape, a balm, a vague set of values that exist beyond the ugliness and venality of the market and the state. Or we look to art for affirmation of our pieties and prejudices. It splits the difference between resistance and complicity.\n\nSontag was also aware of living in emergency conditions, in a world menaced by violence, environmental disaster, political polarization and corruption. But the art she valued most didn\u2019t soothe the anguish of modern life so much as refract and magnify its agonies. She didn\u2019t read \u2014 or go to movies, plays, museums or dance performances \u2014 to retreat from that world but to bring herself closer to it. What art does, she says again and again, is confront the nature of human consciousness at a time of historical crisis, to unmake and redefine its own terms and procedures. It confers a solemn obligation: \u201cFrom now to the end of consciousness, we are stuck with the task of defending art.\u201d\n\n20 \u201cConsciousness\u201d is one of her keywords, and she uses it in a way that may have an odd ring to 21st-century ears. It\u2019s sometimes invoked now, in a weak sense, as a synonym for the moral awareness of injustice. Its status as a philosophical problem, meanwhile, has been diminished by the rise of cognitive science, which subordinates the mysteries of the human mind to the chemical and physical operations of the brain.\n\nBut consciousness as Sontag understands it has hardly vanished, because it names a phenomenon that belongs \u2014 in ways that escape scientific analysis \u2014 to both the individual and the species. Consciousness inheres in a single person\u2019s private, incommunicable experience, but it also lives in groups, in cultures and populations and historical epochs. Its closest synonym is thought, which similarly dwells both within the walls of a solitary skull and out in the collective sphere.\n\nIf Sontag\u2019s great theme was consciousness, her great achievement was as a thinker. Usually that label is reserved for theorists and system-builders \u2014 Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud \u2014 but Sontag doesn\u2019t quite belong in that company. Instead, she wrote in a way that dramatized how thinking happens. The essays are exciting not just because of the ideas they impart but because you feel within them the rhythms and pulsations of a living intelligence; they bring you as close to another person as it is possible to be.\n\n21 \u201cUnder the Sign of Saturn\u201d opens in a \u201ctiny room in Paris\u201d where she has been living for the previous year \u2014 \u201csmall bare quarters\u201d that answer \u201csome need to strip down, to close off for a while, to make a new start with as little as possible to fall back on.\u201d Even though, according to Sigrid Nunez, Sontag preferred to have other people around her when she was working, I tend to picture her in the solitude of that Paris room, which I suppose is a kind of physical manifestation, a symbol, of her solitary consciousness. A consciousness that was animated by the products of other minds, just as mine is activated by hers. If she\u2019s alone in there, I can claim the privilege of being her only company.\n\nWhich is a fantasy, of course. She has had better readers, and I have loved other writers. The metaphors of marriage and possession, of pleasure and power, can be carried only so far. There is no real harm in reading casually, promiscuously, abusively or selfishly. The page is a safe space; every word is a safe word. Your lover might be my husband.\n\nIt\u2019s only reading. By which I mean: It\u2019s everything.", "description": "The critic A.O.
