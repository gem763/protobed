It was the second straight month of weaker year-on-year data. China expects annual GDP growth of 6% to 6.5% this year, down from last year's 6.6% growth.\n\nStill, investors appeared relieved the numbers weren't worse, considering the ongoing tariff war with the U.S. and signs of a global slowdown.\n\n\"While the GDP is testing the lower bound of the official annual 6-6.5% target, today's data suggests there is a very limited risk of breaching the lower bounds of that target this year,\" Stephen Innes, Asia-Pacific market strategist for AxiTrader, wrote in a note. \"While risk asset is not flashing all green, markets can breathe a sigh of relief.\"\n\nJapan's Nikkei rose 0.6% as a core inflation reading fell to 0.3% in September, the lowest level since April 2017, but in line with analysts' expectations. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.1% giving up early gains, while the Shanghai Composite fell 0.2% and the smaller-cap Shenzhen Composite was last about flat. South Korea's Kospi was flat as well, while benchmark indexes in Taiwan , Singapore , Indonesia and Malaysia were little changed. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.6%.\n\nAmong individual stocks, robotics maker Fanuc (6954.TO) gained in Tokyo trading, along with Rakuten (4755.TO) and Fast Retailing (9983.TO) . In Hong Kong, Sunny Optical (2382.HK) and AIA (1299.HK) gained, while property developers such as Wharf Real Estate (1997.HK) retreated after big gains Thursday. Kia Motors (000270.SE) gained in South Korea, while Westpac (WBC.AU) and Commonwealth Bank (CBA.AU) slipped in Australia.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 23:31 ET (03:31 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
