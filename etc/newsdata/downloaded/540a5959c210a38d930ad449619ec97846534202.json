Analysts had expected $435 million in revenue for the quarter.\n\nMore from Variety\n\n\u201cWe delivered strong results this quarter, and we are pleased that the investments we have made are continuing to drive the growth of our community and our business,\u201d said Snap CEO Evan Spiegel in a statement. \u201cWe are a high growth business, with strong operating leverage, a clear path to profitability, a distinct vision for the future, and the ability to invest over the long term. We are excited about executing on the many opportunities in front of us.\u201d\n\nHowever, while Spiegel may be talking up a path to profitability, Snap is still losing a lot of money to sustain its growth: The company\u2019s losses for the quarter came in at $227 million, compared to $325 million a year ago. Q3 2019 results translated to losses of $0.16 per share.\n\nContinued losses also seemed to be on the minds of investors Tuesday afternoon, with Snap Inc.\u2019s share price declining by as much as 5% in after-hours trading, only to stabilize around 2% down following the earnings call.\n\nSnapchat specifically called out its Discover content distribution platform as a growth engine, declaring that time spent by Snapchat users watching Discover content had grown 40% year-over-year. In the third quarter, over 100 Discover channels reached a monthly audience of 10 million or more viewers, according to the company.\n\nIn prepared remarks for Tuesday\u2019s earnings call, Spiegel painted the traction professional content is seeing on Snapchat as part of a broader movement of audiences away from traditional TV and towards mobile screens. \u201cWe believe that this shift in behavior towards mobile content has created a large opportunity for our business, and we are excited about investing more to scale our content platform,\u201d he said.\n\nInterestingly, Snap didn\u2019t provide any success metrics for its nascent gaming business that launched in April of this year. Instead, Spiegel seemed to taper expectations, telling investors that gaming would be a medium-term opportunity that may come more into focus over the next 3-5 years.\n\nSpiegel also reiterated the company\u2019s interest in augmented reality (AR) beyond the phone, but cautioned that AR headsets may take some time to arrive. \u201cOver the long term, the next 7-10 years, we will work towards realizing our vision of computing overlaid on the world through wearable augmented reality,\u201d he said.\n\nSnap continues to iterate on Spectacles as a precursor to full-blown AR glasses, but Spiegel made it clear on Tuesday that the product is little more than an experiment for the company. \u201cWe are building low volumes of Spectacles 3 and using this iteration to test and learn more about wearable computing,\u201d he said.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
