The stench of relegation is already overpowering.\n\nRodgers will return to Liverpool for the first time next weekend and optimism is continuing to build with each passing week that something magical is stirring at Leicester.\n\nThey will probably never win the Premier League title again, but these are heady days and there will never be a better chance for them to break into the top six again.\n\nThings went from bad to worse for Steve Bruce Credit: Reuters\n\nNewcastle are the only team to win at the King Power since Rodgers\u2019s appointment in February, but this was always going to be a far more difficult task.\n\nThe visitors actually made the brighter start, with Miguel Almiron at the heart of their promising counter-attacks, without ever presenting Leicester with any nervy moments.\n\nAnd they were behind after 17 minutes. It was a wonderful goal from Ricardo Pereira, running from his own half and exchanging passes with Ayoze Perez before racing towards the Newcastle penalty area and striking a fine left-footed shot into the bottom corner.\n\nStory continues\n\nNo wonder Rodgers is so bewildered over Pereira\u2019s continued absence from the Portuguese national squad.\n\nNewcastle\u2019s defending was incredibly suspect in the build-up, and Leicester almost capitalised again when Ben Chilwell\u2019s flick over Martin Dubravka was cleared away from goal by Jamaal Lascelles.\n\nIsaac Hayden was dismissed for a horrible lunge on Dennis Praet in the first half Credit: AP\n\nThe rain was relentless, Bruce completely drenched in the technical area, and the gallows humour from the Newcastle supporters was flowing.\n\nNewcastle\u2019s afternoon then plumbed further depths of misery two minutes before half-time with Hayden\u2019s dismissal.\n\nAs another Newcastle move broke down, Praet turned and was caught by the full force of Hayden, who may have won the ball first but followed through with his right foot just below the Belgian midfielder\u2019s knee.\n\nHayden was furious, insisting it was a legitimate challenge, and needed to be escorted off the field to the tunnel by Lascelles. Yet it was reckless, dangerous and, with the conditions so wet, could have been even worse.\n\nNewcastle had been so poor, so devoid of ideas and lightweight in key areas, that further Leicester goals were inevitable.\n\nThe second goal came ten minutes into the second half and owed much to Jamie Vardy\u2019s predatory instincts. As Newcastle hesitated, Vardy raced onto Barnes\u2019s chipped pass and beat Dubravka at the near post.\n\nRicardo set Leicester on their way with a fine goal Credit: Reuters\n\nLeicester were now rampant, increasing their lead in the 56th minute after another Newcastle mistake. Pereira played in Praet and his attempted cross took a huge deflection off Paul Dummett to squirm over the line.\n\nWith the home fans chanting about European tours, Vardy added the fourth with a simple header from close range after a fine cross from substitute Marc Albrighton.\n\nThe outstanding Wilfred Ndidi completed the demolition job in added time, turning in the area to beat Dubravka and secure Rodgers his biggest win yet.\n\nAs time ebbed away, the 2,649 travelling Newcastle supporters continued to chant \u201cWe\u2019ll support you ever more\u201d. Bruce is one of them, but his dream job is turning rapidly into a nightmare.\n\n6:22PM\n\nFull time: Leicester 5 Newcastle 0\n\nWow. That was some performance from Leicester, and a real statement of intent. Five goals and completely dominant in every department. This is a club on the up, and this result takes them back into the top four with a very healthy goal difference.\n\nFor Newcastle, it really is hard to see where they go from here. How can there be any future for Steve Bruce after this result? Yes, they weren't helped by Isaac Hayden's ludicrous challenge that saw him sent off in the first half but they never threatened at any point in this game and fully deserved to get thrashed.\n\n6:19PM\n\nGOAL!!!!! Leicester 5 Newcastle 0 (Ndidi)\n\nChilwell whips a hopeful ball into the Newcastle box and it finds its way through to Ndidi, who takes a touch, swivels and shoots low past Dubravka. Five-nil, and just so easy.\n\n6:17PM\n\n88 mins - Leicester 4 Newcastle 0\n\nNewcastle finally manage to string a few passes together. Still, they don't get the ball to within anything like striking distance of Schmeichel's goal. Leicester break and Schar takes down Ndidi. Yellow card.\n\n6:14PM\n\n86 mins - Leicester 4 Newcastle 0\n\nNewcastle Twitter focuses admirably on the positives:\n\n83' - Carroll produces a fine sliding tackle to deny the attacking Periera before Dummett blocks the right back's cross. 4-0. #NUFC \u2014 Newcastle United FC (@NUFC) September 29, 2019\n\n6:11PM\n\n83 mins - Leicester 4 Newcastle 0\n\nAnother Leicester change: Demarai Gray replaces Ayoze Perez.\n\n6:09PM\n\n81 mins - Leicester 4 Newcastle 0\n\nLeicester are knocking the ball around deep in Newcastle territory, going down each flank and coming back, recycling possession over and over again. Newcastle, exhausted and deflated, can't get near it.\n\nWhere do Newcastle and Steve Bruce go from here? Credit: Getty images\n\n6:08PM\n\n78 mins - Leicester 4 Newcastle 0\n\nDennis Praet gets a standing ovation as he walks off to be replaced by Hamza Choudhury after a fine day's work on his first Premier League start.\n\n6:02PM\n\n73 mins - Leicester 4 Newcastle 0\n\nAlmiron is replaced by DeAndre Yedlin, who is making his return from injury. Leicester in complete control... and going in search of a fifth goal.\n\n5:59PM\n\n70 mins - Leicester 4 Newcastle 0\n\nFair play to the away fans who are still singing louder than the Leicester lot. They may as well try and enjoy themselves.\n\n5:56PM\n\n67 mins - Leicester 4 Newcastle 0\n\nNot let up whatsoever for Newcastle. Albrighton wins a free-kick on the left in a dangerous position. Longstaff looks like he is about to cry. Chilwell puts the free-kick into the wall.\n\n5:52PM\n\nGOOOOAAL!!!! Leicester 4 Newcastle 0 (Vardy)\n\nVardy has another! Albrighton drifts forwards on the left, is allowed back onto his favoured right foot and he puts it on a plate for Vardy to head home from all of three yards. It's a lovely goal but it is just so, so easy.\n\n5:51PM\n\n63 mins - Leicester 3 Newcastle 0\n\nWhere does Steve Bruce go from here? I can't see how Mike Ashley could possibly justify keeping him on. The team just looks completely, totally utterly hopeless.\n\nHe has an idea, though. Big Andy Carroll. He's going to solve all of Newcastle's problems, isn't he? He comes on for Joelinton.\n\n5:49PM\n\nA player reborn\n\n13 - Since Brendan Rodgers\u2019 first match with Leicester in March, Jamie Vardy has scored more Premier League goals than any other player; netting 13 times in 17 appearances. Unleashed. pic.twitter.com/XRMY7hgL4y \u2014 OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) September 29, 2019\n\n5:48PM\n\n60 mins - Leicester 3 Newcastle 0\n\nMarc Albrighton replaces Harvey Barnes for Leicester.\n\n5:45PM\n\nGOOOOAAL!! Leicester 3 Newcastle 0 (Dummett og)\n\nAnd another! Ricardo comes forward through the middle, draws a defender in and then slips the overlapping Praet in. He looks to square it for Vardy but Dummett gets in the way of it, and succeeds only in wrongfooting Dubravka and the ball spins just inside the near post.\n\n5:42PM\n\nGOAAAAALL!!!!! Leicester 2 Newcastle 0 (Vardy)\n\nBarnes races onto a ball in the left channel and he spots Vardy motoring through the middle. He slips him in first time and Vardy, from a tight angle, strikes low at goal with his left foot and beats Dubravka (possibly too easily). Game well and truly over.\n\n5:40PM\n\n52 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nLongstaff lofts it towards the back post but it is too high for Joelinton and bounces out for a goal kick. A waste.\n\n5:40PM\n\n51 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nAtsu wins a free-kick deep in Leicester territory and this is the kind of position Newcastle simply have to take advantage of. Longstaff is over it and the centre-backs plod forward.\n\n5:37PM\n\n47 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nA bit of early possession for Newcastle, who have at least started energetically. Ki provides a bit of calm in central midfield.\n\n5:34PM\n\nSecond half\n\n10-man Newcastle get the second half started.\n\n5:34PM\n\nSomeone in the office just suggested some people think that *wasn't* a red card\n\nHayden followed through and caught Praet high up on his leg Credit: AP\n\nLet's be clear: it was.\n\n5:21PM\n\nHalf time\n\nOne way traffic from start to finish, that. Leicester have been superior in just about every department, with Vardy, Barnes and Tielemans looking very bright, and the marauding full-backs Chilwell and goalscorer Ricardo impressing again. Fully deserving of their lead.\n\nIt was a miserable first 45 minutes for the visitors. I have no idea what Newcastle's game plan is. I have no idea how Bruce wants this team to play. And things got worse for them when Isaac Hayden made a completely needless challenge and was rightly sent off.\n\n5:18PM\n\nVideo of that red card challenge. Easy decision for the ref.\n\nRED CARD FOR HAYDEN\n\n\n\nIsaac Hayden is rightly sent off for a poor tackle on Praet.\n\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd Watch on Sky Sports Premier League\n\n\ufffd\ufffd Follow #LEINEW here: https://t.co/pb2ykGjLOb\n\n\ufffd\ufffd Download the @SkySports app! pic.twitter.com/tWvFF4aDcm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) September 29, 2019\n\n5:18PM\n\n45 mins +2 - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nVardy and Tielemans combine well to open up a shooting opportunity for Barnes... but he blazes over from the edges of the box.\n\n5:16PM\n\n45 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nNewcastle make a change to replace the dismissed central midfielder: Ki Sung-yueng replaces Yoshinori Muto.\n\n5:12PM\n\nRED CARD! Isaac Hayden is sent off!\n\nHayden flies in far, far too strongly for a loose ball and although he gets the ball first it's a really reckless challenge and he connects horribly with Dennis Praet's standing leg. It looks nasty and Craig Pawson has no hesitation in showing Hayden the red card.\n\nRed card for Hayden Credit: Sky Sports\n\nIt's an awful, awful challenge and I cannot understand how Hayden is protesting that.\n\n5:12PM\n\n42 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nTielemans whips in a vicious low cross which Vardy flicks goalwards but he gets too much on it and it goes well over the bar.\n\n5:10PM\n\n40 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nNewcastle just cannot keep hold of the ball anywhere near Leicester's goal. Quite what their game plan is, I have no idea. Hopeless balls forward with no target.\n\n5:07PM\n\n37 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nA bit of pinball around midfield as the wet conditions start to take their toll. Schar then nicks ball behind for a cheap corner as the ball skids off the surface away from him.\n\nBrendan will be happy with what he has seen so far Credit: Getty images\n\n5:04PM\n\n34 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nAtsu gets a chance to run at Ricardo, beats him around the outside and shoots... but it flies well over the bar.\n\n5:01PM\n\n31 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nNewcastle break from the resulting corner but Schar - not the man you want to see in that position - gets it all wrong the halfway line out on the right. I think it was an attempt to chip the ball into Muto's path but he only manages to smack it straight off the pitch and out for a goal kick.\n\n5:00PM\n\n30 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nA wicked cross from the left by Barnes is punched away by Dubravka who made a good decision to come for a ball that he might have left, but it falls only as far as Praet, who drills a shot goalwards, only for a flurry of Newcastle bodies to block.\n\n4:57PM\n\nWatch: Ricardo puts Leicester in front\n\nGOAL FOR LEICESTER\n\n\n\nA superb run and finish from Ricardo!\n\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd Watch on Sky Sports Premier League\n\n\ufffd\ufffd Follow #LEINEW here: https://t.co/pb2ykGjLOb\n\n\ufffd\ufffd Download the @SkySports app! pic.twitter.com/NrssMpao4M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) September 29, 2019\n\n4:55PM\n\n25 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nJamie Vardy is booked - rather harshly in my opinion - after chasing down Fabian Schar as he went to clear the ball. He might have caught him but Schar went down theatrically. I don't think Vardy has done much wrong there.\n\n4:53PM\n\n23 mins - Leicester 1 Newcastle 0\n\nNot much in the way of a response from Newcastle. Leicester come again with a chance for Chilwell and then Ricardo gets into the Newcastle box but can't get the ball under control. Flying full-backs are really fun, aren't they?\n\n4:49PM\n\nSuch a good player, and hard to disagree with any of this.\n\nStrong argument that Leicester City have the second best full-back pair in the league (after Liverpool). Pereira could play as a winger. \u2014 Daniel Storey (@danielstorey85) September 29, 2019\n\nAlmost every time I watch Ricardo Pereira play I wonder how the hell clubs like Spurs and Utd let him slip to Leicester. Absolutely ridiculous. \u2014 Sam Tighe (@stighefootball) September 29, 2019\n\nHow many other right-backs in the league could do that? Brilliant. \u2014 Joe Brewin (@JoeBrewinFFT) September 29, 2019\n\n4:46PM\n\nGOAAAAAL!!!! Leicester 1 Newcastle 0 (Ricardo)\n\nWhat a goal that is! Ricardo picks the ball up on the touchline on halfway, plays a neat one-two with Perez out on the wing, and the storms right through the heart of the opposition. They back off and back off and back off, and Ricardo all of a sudden finds himself on the edge of the box. He slides a delicate finish low towards the far corner and it fizzes off the surface and into the net!\n\n4:46PM\n\n15 mins - Leicester 0 Newcastle 0\n\nPerez does well to dig out a cross on the right, and he finds Tielemans at the back post. He volleys at goal first time but it is clearly blocked and should be given as a corner, but Craig Pawson gives a goal kick. Tielemans isn't happy.\n\n4:43PM\n\n12 mins - Leicester 0 Newcastle 0\n\nLeicester still very much on top and controlling proceedings but Newcastle have settled into the game well enough and showing more than a little adventure on the break.\n\nThe ball falls to Hayden 25 yards from goal and out to the right. He lines up a shot but drags it horribly... and it very nearly plays Muto in. He gets his feet stuck under himself though and can't direct it towards goal.\n\n4:40PM\n\nThe injured James Maddison watches on\n\nJames Maddison watches on from the stands\n\n4:36PM\n\n6 mins - Leicester 0 Newcastle 0\n\nLong, raking, direct ball from Jonny Evans so nearly gets Vardy in on goal but Schar sticks out a toe to clear.\n\n4:34PM\n\n4 mins - Leicester 0 Newcastle 0\n\nLeicester have started this match at some tempo. Their pressing is suffocating the Newcastle defence.\n\n4:33PM\n\n2 mins - Leicester 0 Newcastle 0\n\nSome early excitement as a ball bound for a goal kick canons off the corner flag and back into play.\n\nAnd then Leicester very nearly open the scoring within two minutes as Barnes storms down the left channel and his cross is turned goalwards by Ayoze Perez. Dubravka gets down well to stop it, though.\n\n4:30PM\n\nNewcastle do what they did in the win at Spurs...\n\n... and having won the toss, they decide to switch ends. It unsettled Spurs. Will it do the same to Leicester?\n\nAnd we're under way.\n\n4:28PM\n\nHere come the players\n\nKick-off is just a couple of minutes away...\n\n4:21PM\n\nSteve Bruce confirms change of formation\n\nThe Newcastle manager tells Sky Sports \"you'll have to wait and see\" if they have changed formation before confirming that injuries to Willems and Ritchie mean Newcastle have \"no natural player in the left wing-back position\" and his team will switch to a back four today.\n\n4:18PM\n\nTalking of Jamie Vardy...\n\nHe has three goals from just nine shots this season. He touches the ball only 20 times per game, but is absolutely crucial to a Leicester side that like to dominate possession. He stretches play with his tireless running and looks like he might actually - somehow - be getting better. My colleague JJ Bull wrote about him this week, and you can (and should) read about him here.\n\nJamie Vardy remains a key player for Leicester Credit: Reuters\n\n4:04PM\n\nHow will Leicester fare without Maddison?\n\nThis will be the first Premier League game this season that Leicester will start without key man James Maddison... He has created more chances than any other Leicester player this season, with 11, and has had more shots than any team-mate, with 20... that's 11 more than striker Jamie Vardy. It's a huge loss.\n\n3:58PM\n\nOoooh, an omen!\n\n1 - Leicester have lost just one of their last nine home games in the Premier League (W6 D2), though that defeat was against Newcastle in April. Resumed. pic.twitter.com/wqW6cmECR4 \u2014 OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) September 29, 2019\n\n3:53PM\n\nArrivals at the KP\n\nA very fly Ben Chilwell Credit: Getty images\n\nSteve Bruce looking dapper Credit: Getty images\n\n3:40PM\n\nAnkle injury does for Maddison\n\nThe ankle injury that Maddison sustained in the win over Tottenham rules him out of this game.\n\nNewcastle, meanwhile, are hoping an extra man up front in Yoshinori Muto can solve their problems in front of goal.\n\n3:35PM\n\nThe teams are in and there is no sign of James Maddison\n\nSix changes for Leicester from the team that beat Luton. No Maddison in the 18:\n\nSchmeichel; Ricardo, Evans, Soyuncu, Chilwell; Ndidi, Tielemans, Barnes, Praet; Perez, Vardy.\n\nThree changes for Newcastle as Muto, Krafth and Longstaff come in. Looks like a 4-4-2:\n\nDubravka; Krafth, Schar, Lascelles, Dummett; Almiron, Hayden, Longstaff, Atsu; Muto, Joelinton.\n\n3:18PM\n\nFinally some footy!\n\nAfter waiting around all day with the rugby and then the Russian Grand Prix, finally it's time for some Premier League football.\n\nTwo teams who feel like they are headed in opposite directions meet in the only game of the day today, with Leicester - very much on an upward trajectory - hosting Newcastle, for whom there is rather little to get excited about right now.\n\nLeicester followed up last week's comeback win over Tottenham with a 4-0 trouncing of Luton in midweek, and they now have the feeling of a club going places under Brendan Rodgers. Widely tipped as the most likely side to break into the top six this season, they can go back into the top four with a positive result here.\n\nLeicester feel like they are going places under Rodgers Credit: Reuters\n\nNewcastle also recently enjoyed an unexpected win over Spurs recently, but that result was the exception rather than the rule to their season so far... otherwise, there have been two draws (against Watford and Brighton), three losses and only three more goals in five matches. Steve Bruce, who began life at Newcastle needing to convince the fans that there was some reason to his appointment, desperately needs a few good results soon if things aren't to turn nasty on Tyneside. Their supporters can be a patient bunch but for a former Sunderland manager there is extremely short shrift. And recent form makes it hard to foresee anything other than a comfortable home win today...\n\nWe'll have team news for you very shortly.", "description": "The rain was torrential, hammering down on Steve Bruce all afternoon, and Newcastle are already submerged in the relegation swamp.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/USnnCT814KPsQJqEdWEd7w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/O.lRC38UIUVZZiKDa_cRAw--~B/aD0xNTY0O3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/e904f5dc0eb5dcfc1104a7bbd1335bc5", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
