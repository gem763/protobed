Medical history, smoking and physical activity were taken into account,\n\nAltogether, there were 2,820 cases of coronary heart disease (CHD) and 1,072 cases of stroke - including 300 haemorrhagic strokes, which happen when a weakened blood vessel bursts and bleeds into the brain.\n\nThe pescatarians were found to have a 13% lower risk of CHD than the meat-eaters, while the vegetarians and vegans had a 22% lower risk.\n\nBut those on plant-based diets had a 20% higher risk of stroke. The researchers suggested this could be linked to low vitamin B12 levels but said more studies were needed to investigate the connection.\n\nIt is also possible that the association may have nothing to do with people's diets and may just reflect other differences in the lives of people who do not eat meat.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Is there such a thing as vegan junk food?\n\nSo does it show vegan and vegetarian diets are unhealthy?\n\nDr Frankie Phillips, from the British Dietetic Association, says not - because this was an observational study.\n\n\"They looked at what people ate and followed them for years, so it's an association, not cause-and-effect,\" she says.\n\n\"The message, for everyone, is it makes sense to have a well-planned diet, and to eat a wide variety of foods.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A varied diet is the key, not \"meat and potatoes every night\"\n\n\"Meat-eaters don't necessarily have a varied diet, because they might live on meat and potatoes for dinner every night and not have any vegetables.\"\n\nHas what people eat changed since this study started?\n\nResearchers did go back to participants in 2010 to ask them again about their diets.\n\nBut Dr Phillips says vegan and vegetarian diets will have changed.\n\n\"This is data that's been collected from a couple of decades ago,\" she says.\n\n\"It might well be that the typical vegetarian diet today looks very different to a vegetarian or vegan diet from 20 or 30 years ago.\n\n\"The range of vegetarian and vegan convenience foods has escalated massively. It's a lot more mainstream.\"\n\nAnd we know more about the health risks linked to eating too much processed and red meat, which has been linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer..\n\nSo what should go on my plate?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe NHS's the Eatwell Guide sets out the balance of foods you need, whatever kind of diet you eat:\n\nEat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day\n\nBase meals around higher-fibre starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, rice or pasta\n\nDon't forget protein - from lean meat, fish, seafood, pulses, tofu or unsalted nuts\n\nInclude dairy or dairy alternatives\n\nFoods high in fat, sugars or salt should be eaten less often and in small amounts\n\nBut people on vegan and vegetarian diets also need to take particular care to consume enough of some specific nutrients.\n\nFor example, people who eat meat, dairy and fish usually have enough vitamin B12, needed for healthy blood and nervous systems.\n\nHowever, vegans can become deficient, though B12 is also present in foods such as fortified breakfast cereals and yeast extract spreads.\n\nIron is also less easily absorbed from plant-based foods, so those who choose not to eat meat need to ensure they include foods such as wholemeal bread and flour, dried fruits and pulses.\n\nAnd there was a call last month for vegans to be aware of the need to ensure they were consuming enough of another nutrient, called choline, important for brain health.", "description": "However, the benefits to the heart seem to outweigh the risks to the brain.", "authors": ["Caroline Parkinson", "Health Editor", "Bbc News Website"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F961/production/_108614836_veganfood.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
