Trump, the president\u2019s younger brother.\n\nAfter the contract was awarded, an anonymous rival bidder filed a complaint with the Justice Department\u2019s office of the inspector general, alleging that CertiPath failed to disclose that \u201cone of the President\u2019s closest living relatives stood to benefit financially from the transaction,\u201d according to a copy of the July 22 complaint letter obtained by The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances of this contract award, and what appear to be CertiPath\u2019s efforts to obscure Mr. Robert Trump\u2019s financial interest in the company even as it trades on the Trump name, present the appearance of preferential treatment for those who are close to the President,\u201d said the complaint, which was sent by Venable, a Washington law firm, on behalf of the client.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
