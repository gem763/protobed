I get behind the wheel of the hottest cars and test them in real-world scenarios. Today I\u2019m testing the MultiPro Tailgate in the GMC Sierra, and giving my full review along the way. This is \u201cReal Reviews\u201d from Cars Insider.\n\nThe GMC Sierra Denali aims to up the game for premium, full-sized pickups. Its cabin is full of luxurious materials, and it has a lot of high technology and driver-assistance features. But it\u2019s what\u2019s in the back that makes the biggest difference. GMC calls it the MultiPro Tailgate, and it has six different configurations. I\u2019m gonna take it to Belleville Lumber Supply today, pick up some home-improvement stuff, and test out all the different setups. But first I\u2019m gonna take the Sierra for a test drive.\n\nThe Sierra Denali has always been one of my favourite pickups. It\u2019s a notch up from the Chevy Silverado, so if the Chevy Silverado\u2019s not really luxurious enough for you, you go to GMC. The Denali trim is GMC\u2019s sort of extra-special, double-cool, you know, premium-materials kind of thing. The driving performance of the truck, it\u2019s great, it\u2019s very smooth, it\u2019s very powerful with the 420-horsepower motor, it\u2019s got gobs of torque, it\u2019s terrifically powerful, it\u2019s gonna be able to tow 9,600 pounds, it can carry 2,000 pounds in the bed. It doesn\u2019t drive like a luxury sedan or a luxury SUV, but it\u2019s about as, you know, smooth and easy a ride as you should expect from a full-size pickup truck without compromising any of the versatility and functionality you need with one of these things.\n\nOK, here I am at Belleville Lumber Supply, and I\u2019m gonna see what this fancy tailgate can do. GMC\u2019s multi tailgate pro is the first of its kind. It offers users better functionality by adding five additional configurations to the primary tailgate function. I\u2019m gonna test out all of these features, except for the standard tailgate, to see if they make a difference. And I\u2019m gonna start with the full-width step.\n\nThe full-width step should make it easier for me to step into the truck bed while loading material, such as these bags of mortar here. God, these are heavy! So far it\u2019s making this job an enormously easier one, \u2019cause these things are not light, and to get up in the bed when it\u2019s just in a standard configuration with no step would be extremely challenging. There\u2019s absolutely no way I would have been able to do that job in, what, about two, three minutes there? Without the step.\n\nNow let\u2019s check out the easy-access feature, which should allow me better access to the bed to unload materials. The way you do the easy-access feature is you fold this up. Look at that, easier access to the back of the truck. Easy access worked as advertised, but I can\u2019t reach the back of the bed to get those sacks out, so I would have to move them a little bit closer to the end of the bed here if I wanted to use the feature.\n\nThe load stop can be used when you\u2019re loading materials that are longer than the bed and the tailgate has to remain open. We\u2019ve got some lumber here that we\u2019re gonna put in, 8 feet long, and slide it in like that. Ah, look at that. It\u2019s too long, it\u2019s going past the load stop, so what I\u2019m gonna have to do is put it in at an angle. That should be fine. This lumber, this is working great. This is an incredibly useful feature, because you\u2019d be in a position of having to secure this wood in the bed if you had it open like this, and you\u2019d have to tie a piece of red flag to it or something to let everybody know it\u2019s a bit of a hazard, but right like this it\u2019s good.\n\nThe inner gate load stop further expands the truck bed at the top. So, you gotta kinda fold the whole thing back up, drop the top, and throw up the inner gate load stop. Now I\u2019m gonna put the lumber in just like I did before. With these 8-foot pieces of lumber, we really are at the limits of this bed\u2019s capabilities. I\u2019m not even sure this is gonna work. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be secure. OK, this is not working out so great. I don\u2019t feel comfortable driving around with this load the way it is, and we were given the short bed of the Sierra Denali to test out. If you had the longer bed, you\u2019d be able to get this wood into this configuration a little bit more comfortably. Now let\u2019s move on to the work-surface test, and for this one I\u2019ve got a slightly different idea.\n\nAnd finally, the work surface turns the truck into a mobile workstation. This is kind of a rolling desk that\u2019s on the back of the bed here, and it\u2019s extremely useful for doing work, but I don\u2019t have any work to do, so I\u2019m going to eat lunch. If I had work to do, on the other hand, it would be absolutely fantastic. It\u2019s a little thing, this feature, but it\u2019s really, really useful. You could set up any of a number of things. You could go over plans for a job, you could set up a laptop here. This truck has 4G LTE WiFi, which will support numerous devices. You also have power back here in the bed of the truck. You could run your laptop off of that, you could run any of a number of devices off of it, you could also have power tools that you\u2019re charging up. So, it\u2019s extremely useful; it\u2019s one of my favourite features of the MultiPro Tailgate. So, those are the five additional features of the MultiPro Tailgate.\n\nNow let\u2019s hop inside and talk about the interior. The Sierra Denali\u2019s interior is about as close to luxurious as you can get in a pickup truck. That\u2019s the whole idea behind the upscale Denali trim level. It\u2019s plush, roomy, and user-friendly. The infotainment system is a freshened-up version of what GM uses across its lineup of vehicles, and it\u2019s one of the top systems in the auto industry. It\u2019s a piece of cake to operate, using the touch-screen interface. You also have OnStar as a backup and fast 4G LTE WiFi connectivity.\n\nThe GMC Sierra Denali as we have it configured here is a $US70,000 pickup, so it\u2019s not really cheap, but it\u2019s so crammed full of technology, premium amenities, and versatility that I think it\u2019s almost a bargain. The MultiPro Tailgate really adds a lot to this truck, as we found out today when we checked it out at Belleville Lumber and found out that in all the different positions it works great, even the inner position with the gate up and the load stop deployed where we couldn\u2019t quite get the lumber in. That wasn\u2019t the truck\u2019s fault. If we had a bigger bed it would have been fine. The 6.2-litre V8 pulls like a freight train and is gonna fill you with confidence if you\u2019re towing a trailer or if you\u2019ve got a 2,000-pound load in the back. If you\u2019re in the market for a premium pickup, the GMC Sierra Denali is really a great choice.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
