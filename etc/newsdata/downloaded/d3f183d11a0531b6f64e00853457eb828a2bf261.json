Photo: Vulture\n\nWith a passel of fiction sequels on the horizon and not one but two Old Masters on this year\u2019s Booker Prize shortlist (Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood), the Serious Season of book publishing is kicking off with a retro flavor. There\u2019s a definitive biography of dear, departed Susan Sontag; creative reconceptions of classic tales like Don Quixote, Frankenstein, and the adventures of David Livingstone; essays by veteran novelist Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re; stories by near-veteran novelist Zadie Smith, and a venture into traditional fiction by auto-fiction superstar Ben Lerner. And yet there\u2019s plenty of invention in these pages \u2014 old ground tread by fresh minds \u2014 as well as a few debut authors and some writers you may not have heard of, but definitely should.\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Great\n\nBy Boris Kachka and Molly Young\n\nSeptember\n\nThe Sweetest Fruits, by Monique Truong (Viking; 9/3)\n\nI\u2019ve been addicted to Truong\u2019s writing ever since her debut, The Book of Salt, a work of historical fiction incorporating real people that felt \u2014 unlike much of that genre \u2014 lush, invigorating, and real. Her third novel fictionalizes Greek-Irish writer Lafcadio Hearn but through the eyes of only his mother and his two wives \u2014 one a freed American slave, the other his Japanese translator. \u2014B.K.\n\nGun Island, by Amitav Ghosh (FSG; 9/10)\n\nWith his \u201cIbis\u201d trilogy, Ghosh recast the adventure story as a commentary on colonial capitalism; his nonfiction book The Great Derangement showed how ill equipped we are to deal with climate change. Gun Island combines the two, following an Indiana Jones\u2013like book dealer on the trail of an ancient Bengali myth. \u2014B.K.\n\nOut of Darkness, Shining Light, by Petina Gappah (Scribner; 9/10)\n\nPerhaps no story was as ripe for the Wide Sargasso Sea treatment (the revision of a classic by marginalized voices) as the tale of missionary David Livingstone\u2019s death in Africa. In contrasting styles, the Zimbabwean novelist lets two characters describe their trek across Africa with Livingstone\u2019s body, beautifully complicating the narrative. \u2014B.K.\n\nSavage Gods, by Paul Kingsnorth (Two Dollar Radio; 9/17)\n\nHow often do we get an environmental activist and poet \u2014 who once worked undercover in West Papua New Guinea, who has been cited by figures as diverse as David Cameron and Mark Rylance, and who believes \u201c[s]ocial media is like a giant communal toilet\u201d \u2014 confronting the failure of language and civilization in 142 pages? \u2014M.Y.\n\nThey Will Have to Die Now: Mosul and the Fall of the Caliphate, by James Verini (W.W. Norton; 9/17)\n\nVerini\u2019s grasp of English makes me feel like I speak an inferior dialect. This account has been compared to Michael Herr, blurbed by George Packer, and applauded by David Petraeus, which must be the military-history equivalent of an EGOT. \u2014M.Y.\n\nOctober\n\nThe Topeka School, by Ben Lerner (FSG; 10/1)\n\nHow do you write your way out of autofiction\u2019s cul-de-sac? Masterfully. Lerner stays close here to his own life and occasionally lets the mask of fiction slip, but his account of an overeducated family in a regional capital of toxic masculinity has all the pleasures of a traditional novel \u2014 a more self-aware Franzen. \u2014B.K.\n\nGrand Union, by Zadie Smith (Penguin; 10/8)\n\nSmith is justly acclaimed for her novels, but she also gives generously between books, with wonderful criticism and the occasional jolt of short fiction. Her first story collection supplements eight published stories with 11 brand-new pieces, many of them dipping into realms far removed from realism (or even hyperrealism). \u2014B.K.\n\nSelf-Portrait in Black and White: Unlearning Race, by Thomas Chatterton Williams (W.W. Norton; 10/15)\n\nIn addition to having a name that sounds like a delectable tea, Williams is a fascinating thinker on topics ranging from Paris couture to shame to Dunkin\u2019s Thin Mint\u00ae latte. His writing is always elegant and frequently commotion-causing; I can only hope this slim volume on race continues the pattern. \u2014M.Y.\n\nAll This Could Be Yours, by Jami Attenberg (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; 10/22)\n\nVersatile, earthbound, and unforgiving, the novelist returns to the comic blend of messy family drama that made The Middlesteins such a smart best seller. This time, the madness swirls around the (sort of) grown children of the dying Victor, a tyrannical and very shady real-estate developer. \u2014B.K.\n\nNovember\n\n97,196 Words, by Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re (FSG; 11/5)\n\nCarr\u00e8re\u2019s books show that books are the original memes: Each of his is a canny artifact of our time, passed among friends to instantly satisfying effect. This collection brings together a quarter-decade\u2019s worth of his nonfiction \u2014 on crime, Catherine Deneuve, Davos, and immigration. \u2014M.Y.\n\nThe Worst Kind of Want, by Liska Jacobs (MCD; 11/5)\n\nThis crispy biscotti of a novel is about a producer who goes to Italy, has a scandalous relationship, and decodes not just the meaning of life but also the meaning of death, sex, dance clubs, and emoji. You\u2019ll feel indecent reading it in public. \u2014M.Y.\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Big\n\nBy Boris Kachka\n\nSeptember\n\nQuichotte, by Salman Rushdie (Random House; 9/3)\n\nTo paraphrase the unnamed target of Rushdie\u2019s satire, some people are saying this is the best Rushdie in a long time.\n\nThe Testaments, by Margaret Atwood (Nan A. Talese; 9/10)\n\nHulu took its liberties with the adventures of Gilead in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, but Atwood is at long last publishing her own sequel. The Booker Prize has already deemed it worthy of its 2019 long list and short list.\n\nRed at the Bone, by Jacqueline Woodson (Riverhead; 9/17)\n\nA National Book Award finalist for adult fiction and a winner for children\u2019s fiction, Woodson returns to the brownstone setting of her last adult novel, Another Brooklyn, for this intricate family drama.\n\nSontag: Her Life and Work, by Benjamin Moser (Ecco; 9/17)\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since the great streaked one roamed the earth, but Moser\u2019s biography should be definitive, uncovering scandalous new details.\n\nThe Water Dancer, by Ta-Nehisi Coates (One World; 9/24)\n\nThe influential public intellectual\u2019s first novel, a magic-realist antebellum slave-escape narrative.\n\nOctober\n\nFrankisstein, by Jeanette Winterson (Grove; 10/1)\n\nThe author is acclaimed for breaking taboos, and this one toggles between the origin story of Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein and an AI scientist\u2019s meet-cute with a transgender muse named Ry Shelley.\n\nOlive, Again, by Elizabeth Strout (Random House; 10/15)\n\nFans of Olive Kitteridge will devour Strout\u2019s sequel, in which the famously ornery Olive tries to become a slightly better person.\n\nFind Me, by Andr\u00e9 Aciman (FSG; 10/29)\n\nIn this sequel to Call Me by Your Name, the original romance thrums in the background, urging the lovers backward and forward in time.\n\n*This article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
