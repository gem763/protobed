It is illegal to solicit or receive foreign help in a U.S. election.\n\nAmong McKinley\u2019s concerns was the administration\u2019s failure to support Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted in March on orders from Trump.\n\nMcKinley, who as a Latin America expert was not specifically involved in Ukraine, was also frustrated that there had been no response to an August inspector general\u2019s report that found significant evidence of leadership and management problems, including allegations from career employees that Assistant Secretary of State Kevin Moley and his former senior adviser Marie Stull retaliated or tried to retaliate against them as holdovers from the Obama administration.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters outside the closed-door hearing that McKinley was complimentary about Pompeo\u2019s role but did raise other issues.\n\n\u201cI think most of this is a concern by a colleague for an ambassador that he held in high regard,\u201d Meadows said, declining to provide more details of the closed session.\n\nRepublicans are crying foul over the process of the impeachment inquiry, but as House Democrats press on with the investigation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell briefed Republicans about the possible trial ahead.\n\nMcConnell warned of a possible House impeachment vote by Thanksgiving that would force a trial in the Senate, likely by Christmas. He used slides and history lessons during a private Senate GOP lunch in the Capitol to talk about the process, according to a person familiar with the meeting.\n\nAt the White House, congressional leaders abruptly ended an explosive meeting with the president on the situation in Syria, when Trump called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a \u201cthird-grade politician,\u201d according to Democrats. Pelosi said later the president was having a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he knows his House colleagues didn\u2019t run for office to conduct an impeachment investigation, but he said, \u201cThe facts that are already in the public domain are so deeply troubling and must be taken very seriously.\u201d\n\nAnother key figure in the impeachment investigation, special envoy Kurt Volker, returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to review the transcript of his Oct. 3 testimony to investigators, according to a person familiar with his appearance.\n\nVolker provided text messages to lawmakers that revealed an effort at the State Department to push Ukraine\u2019s leader into opening an investigation of the gas company Burisma connected to Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, in return for a visit with Trump.\n\nThat effort soon escalated into what one diplomat feared was a quid pro quo for U.S. military aid. Trump has denied that, saying assistance to Ukraine was delayed to pressure the country into addressing corruption.\n\nAnother ambassador involved in those text message exchanges, Gordon Sondland, has been asked to appear Thursday.\n\nThe testimony so far from the witnesses, mainly officials from the State Department and other foreign policy posts, largely corroborates the account of the government whistleblower whose complaint first sparked the impeachment inquiry, according to lawmakers attending the closed-door interviews.\n\nOne witness said it appeared \u201cthree amigos\u201d tied to the White House \u2014Sondland, Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry \u2014 had taken over foreign policy. Another quoted national security adviser John Bolton as calling Giuliani a \u201chand grenade\u201d for his back-channel efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nTrump\u2019s July 25 phone call in which he pressed Ukraine\u2019s president , Volodymr Zelenskiy, to investigate Biden\u2019s family is at the center of the Democrats\u2019 inquiry.\n\nPelosi, despite intensifying calls from Trump and Republicans to hold a formal vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry, showed no indication she would do so. She said Congress will continue its investigation as part of the Constitution\u2019s system of checks and balances of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThis is not a game for us. This is deadly serious. We\u2019re on a path that is taking us, a path to the truth,\u201d Pelosi told reporters Tuesday.\n\nTrump calls the impeachment inquiry an \u201cillegitimate process\u201d and has blocked officials from cooperating.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are bracing for a vote and trial. House GOP Whip Steve Scalise invited GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was an impeachment manager decades ago during President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, to brief Republican lawmakers on the process ahead.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee overseeing the probe, has praised the State Department officials for stepping forward, under subpoena, to shed light on the matter.\n\n\u201cWe have learned much of this thanks to the courageous testimony of the State Department officials who have been put in an impossible situation by the administration,\u201d which is urging them not to comply with requests to testify to Congress, he said. \u201cThey are doing their duty.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael Balsamo, Andrew Taylor, Matthew Daly, Colleen Long, Padmananda Rama, Eric Tucker and Alan Fram contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A former top State Department aide testified in the impeachment inquiry that the Trump administration's politicization of foreign policy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/0e012c_trump-impeachment-52971-michael-mckinley-michael-mckinley-top-aide-secretary-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
