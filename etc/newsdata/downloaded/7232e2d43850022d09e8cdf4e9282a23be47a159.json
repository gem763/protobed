In the letter, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian, Cook says \u201cthese decisions are never easy, and it is harder still to discuss these topics during moments of furious public debate. It\u2019s out of my great respect for the work you do every day that I want to share the way we went about making this decision.\n\nHong Kong protests: Apple pulls tracking app after China criticism Read more\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill. This case is no different. The app in question allowed for the crowdsourced reporting and mapping of police checkpoints, protest hotspots and other information. On its own, this information is benign.\n\n\u201cHowever, over the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimise individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law.\u201d\n\nBut Cook\u2019s claims have been disputed by those on the ground, who argue the violations described don\u2019t match up with what the app displays. Individual officers are not displayed on the map, an online version of which is still live: only large concentrations of police are shown, with the stated intention of allowing protesters to avoid rather than confront law enforcement.\n\nSimilarly, the app does not display areas where \u201cno police are present\u201d, since it only focuses on police concentrations that are large enough to affect protests.\n\nCharles Mok, a member of Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council, wrote to Cook saying he was \u201cdeeply disappointed with Apple\u2019s decision to ban the app, and would like to contest the claims made by Hong Kong police force.\n\n\u201cHKmap.live helps HK residents, journalists, tourists, etc \u2026 avoid being hurt by teargas, rubber bullets, baton, beanbag round and water cannon that the Hong Kong police claims to be \u2018minimum force\u2019, and get real-time updates of public transport.\n\nCharles Mok \u83ab\u4e43\u5149 (@charlesmok) Today I wrote to Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, to tell him his company\u2019s decision to remove HKmap live app from Appstore will cause problems for normal Hong Kong\u2019s citizens trying to avoid police presence while they are under constant fear ofpolice brutality. Values over profits, pls! pic.twitter.com/guaBfV8Pnf\n\nIn its initial response, the developer of HKmap.live said Apple\u2019s decision to pull the app was \u201cclearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human rights in #HongKong\u201d.\n\nMaciej Ceg\u0142owski, a software developer and activist who has been reporting from Hong Kong over the summer, tweeted that the claim the app violated the law was similarly unfounded. \u201cNeither he or anyone else at Apple has specified which law this is. At a press conference today, Hong Kong authorities didn\u2019t know either, and deferred all questions on the matter to Apple.\u201d\n\n'Protecting rioters': China warns Apple over app that tracks Hong Kong police Read more\n\nOthers have noted the apparent double standards at play. A number of services, most notably the driving app Waze, prominently offer western users the option of avoiding police speed checks. Waze, a Google subsidiary, advertises the feature on the very first page of its entry on the iOS App Store. \u201cAvoid traffic, police and accidents,\u201d it says, with an icon depicting a police officer on the map.\n\n\u201cI offer my sincerest condolences to @waze,\u201d Ceg\u0142owski tweeted, \u201cwhich unlike HKmap is an app specifically intended for evading law enforcement, and which by Mr. Cook\u2019s logic must therefore brace itself for imminent removal from the App Store.\u201d", "description": "Apple chief said in a letter HKmap.live was \u2018used maliciously to target\u2019 officers as claim was disputed by protesters on the ground", "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20acff22baa8739bdc37f3b00846ebf74fce3a93/0_216_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=593c753640189fe58d8bb3a5f66dceb6", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
