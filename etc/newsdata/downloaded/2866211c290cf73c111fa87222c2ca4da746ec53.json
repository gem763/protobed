USA TODAY\n\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. \u2014 Consider what it must have been like for Lamical Perine and his Florida running back friends Saturday. All game long, they kept slamming into a wall. No room to run. Sometimes, it probably seemed against those monstrous Auburn defenders, nowhere to hide.\n\nAnd then, suddenly opportunity opened wide. It was getting late and Florida was clinging to a slim lead when Perine bounded through a rare hole. Bounced off a linebacker. And bolted 88 yards down the home sideline for the clinching touchdown.\n\n\u201cIt almost brought tears to my eyes,\u201d he said later.\n\nWell, sure. A 24-13 victory against Auburn was terrific, yes. Important, no question. In the moment when Perine broke free, Florida Field\u2019s decibel level rocketed from ear-crackling to painful. And when it was over, the party kept going for a while.\n\n\u201cJust a big-time atmosphere, big-time crowd,\u201d Perine said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I was able to make that big-time play.\u201d\n\nLAMICAL PERINE 88 YARDS TO THE HOUSE.\n\nTHE SWAMP IS ROCKING. pic.twitter.com/ZkbQ30mtsd \u2014 CBS Sports (@CBSSports) October 5, 2019\n\nEnjoy it, Gators. Revel a little in the program\u2019s biggest win since \u2013 well, when? \u2013 and that 6-0 record, and the rise in the rankings that\u2019s about to happen. But do it quickly, and then reset. Up next: A visit to LSU.\n\n\u201cYou know what winning a big-time game like this means?\u201d Florida coach Dan Mullen said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to show up and get ready to win an even bigger one next week. That\u2019s life in the SEC.\u201d\n\nAt least for Florida, Auburn and LSU, that\u2019s exactly right. For those three teams, which finished September unbeaten, this month features a round-robin of destiny. Or doom. Nothing but slamming into each other, over and over again, hoping to exploit a sliver of opportunity.\n\nAuburn is the first to go down (and still has LSU awaiting). This week, we get Florida heading to Baton Rouge. Come November, they all get their shots at Alabama or Georgia (or in Auburn\u2019s case, both). But well before then, they\u2019ll be defined by this triangulating schedule.\n\nWinners and losers: Michigan leads way in Week 6\n\nWeek 6 observations: College football is often random, so don't write off Auburn yet\n\nGive Round 1 to Florida. And give the Gators some leeway if the postgame celebration was accompanied by more than a hint of defiance. Of the five SEC teams ranked in the Top 10 last week, Florida was the easiest to deem unworthy \u2013 and the Gators knew it.\n\n\u201cA lot of people doubted us, said we were overrated and stuff,\u201d junior safety Donovan Stiner said. \u201cI think our record speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nIf not, how about now?\n\n\u201cWe just want everybody to know that we\u2019re here,\u201d Perine said.\n\nBut where, exactly, are they? The 11-point final margin was more than a little deceptive in a game that was either a defensive slugfest, a futile slog by anemic offenses, a quasi-comedy of flawed but fun teams trading errors \u2013 or maybe all of the above.\n\nFlorida won despite four turnovers, and because a ferocious defense clamped down on Auburn, and because of a gutsy performance by quarterback Kyle Trask, who returned after a scary-looking knee injury (which Mullen later called a sprained ligament) to play solidly. Or else the Gators won because of Auburn\u2019s four turnovers, and an erratic performance by Tigers quarterback Bo Nix, who played like a true freshman.\n\nLet\u2019s go with the first theory: Florida\u2019s defense was dominant. Auburn managed 92 yards and two first downs in the first half. In the second half, the Tigers threatened but never found the end zone. And Perine\u2019s run provided just enough cushion to overcome Auburn\u2019s own very good defense. That combination might not be good enough to dub Florida a true SEC contender \u2013 but it pushes the Gators one step closer, anyway, to getting there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cI know what the Gator standard is. I know what the expectations are. Trust me, my expectations are higher than that.\u201d\n\nAnd later, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ll get there.\u201d\n\nFlorida defensive back Marco Wilson celebrates his fourth-quarter interception vs. Auburn. (Photo: Douglas DeFelice, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nStill, here\u2019s how close they were to going somewhere else. Trailing 17-13 late in the third quarter, Auburn suddenly began moving the ball on the ground. It set up a deep shot by Nix. Seth Williams was wide open, several steps beyond the defense.\n\n\u201cIt could have been a changing play in the game,\u201d Perine said.\n\nBut that\u2019s the point. The ball was overthrown. Williams strained to catch it, but instead of scoring he tumbled to the ground at the 13. Three plays later, Nix\u2019s pass into the end zone was intercepted by free safety Donovan Stiner. Auburn\u2019s bid for the lead was finished.\n\nFlorida forces the Nix pick! pic.twitter.com/4UawXnTj82 \u2014 CBS Sports (@CBSSports) October 5, 2019\n\nA few moments later, Perine took the handoff on an outside zone play. He broke out of the grasp of linebacker K.J. Britt, avoided safety Daniel Thomas \u2013 and was gone.\n\n\u201cThe offensive line had a lot of ups and downs,\u201d Perine said, \u201cbut at the end of the day, they just blocked it up perfect for me. I made two guys miss, and it was just a great thing to see open field like that.\u201d\n\nIt was the longest touchdown run by a Florida player since 1988. It clinched what seems like the biggest win since \u2013 well, in a very long time \u2013 and set up an even bigger opportunity against LSU. These Gators are flawed. But they\u2019re unbeaten, headed for another showdown. They\u2019ll keep trying what finally worked against Auburn, hoping for a similar result. As Mullen put it:\n\n\u201cPounding away, nothing happening \u2013 bang!\u201d", "description": "Florida is flawed but still 6-0 after beating Auburn. Can they stay undefeated?
