There's no question about it. Some of the limitations: We wanted it at a specific time, we wanted it in early June, so that limits it a little bit. And there's difficulties with going various places.\"\n\nTrump floated the idea of hosting the next summit at his financially underperforming resort after the G7 summit this year in Biarritz, France, saying Doral was both spacious and conveniently located next to Miami International Airport.\n\nThe Washington Post reported in May that Doral's net operating income had plunged by a stunning 69% since 2015. Between 2016 and 2017 alone, revenue at Doral fell 13.8% and net operating income dropped 62%, according to the Post's David Fahrenthold.\n\nFarenthold further tweeted on Thursday: \"The summit will be held in June, when Miami is hot and Doral is usually empty. In 2017, only 38% of Doral's rooms were occupied in June. Only August (31%) was slower.\" He added that with Trump hosting a summit of world leaders at the facility in June, the resort would be fully booked.\n\nRead more: House Judiciary Committee says it will investigate Trump's pitch to host the next G7 summit at his Doral resort\n\nThe decision raised obvious ethical issues and concerns that Trump, in hosting a massive summit at one of his company's properties, would be profiting from his presidency. The emoluments clause of the US Constitution bars presidents from accepting any cash or valuable gifts from foreign governments without approval from Congress.\n\n\"I was skeptical. I was,\" Mulvaney told reporters. \"I was aware of the political sort of criticism that we'd come under for doing it at Doral, which is why I was so surprised when the advance team called back and said this is the perfect physical location to do this.\"\n\nWhen a reporter raised the issue of Trump profiting from the event, Mulvaney said: \"Again, he's not making any money off of this, just like he's not making any money from working here. And if you think it's going to help his brand, that's great, but I would suggest that he probably doesn't need much help promoting his brand.\"", "description": "The Washington Post recently reported that the Miami Doral resort's net operating income had fallen by a stunning 69% since 2015.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da89cfbcc4a0a133b3e4523?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
