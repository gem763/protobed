Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports\n\n(Reuters) - LeBron James weighed in on the controversy between China and the NBA on Monday, saying that Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated\u201d when he sent a tweet in support of protesters in Hong Kong this month. Morey\u2019s tweet of support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong on Oct. 4 set off a firestorm, prompting Chinese sponsors and partners to cut ties with the league and the National Basketball Association (NBA) to answer difficult questions about free speech. \u201cWe all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech. But at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others,\u201d James told reporters before the Lakers\u2019 preseason game against Golden State in California. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.\u201d Not long after the media session, James took to Twitter to clarify his statements. \u201cLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet,\u201d James tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 tweets and statement have set off their own firestorm, with basketball fans in the U.S. and China sounding off.\n\nOn Twitter, many users responded to his statement with anger. \u201cWeak,\u201d said one user. Others simply posted emoji of bags of money.\n\nOn the other side of China\u2019s Great Firewall, netizens weighed in to support James, whose statements were trending on Weibo, China\u2019s equivalent to Twitter, and Douyin, a popular short video platform owned by Bytedance Ltd.\n\n\u201cMy James is being attacked by Americans, Americans believe Morey should be supported, and James\u2019 words are basically opposing Morey,\u201d said one user on Weibo. \u201cSigh, I love you James, hope you can continue to be healthy and play ball!\u201d\n\nThe Lakers played two exhibition games in China against the Brooklyn Nets last week, but the NBA canceled media availability for the teams during the trip. A Rockets staff member also shut down a CNN reporter in Tokyo last week while trying to ask players a question about the controversy. The league later apologized to the reporter in a statement. James is one of the few NBA representatives to speak openly about the contention.\n\n\u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week,\u201d he tweeted on Monday. \u201cI think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\u201d", "description": "LeBron James weighed in on the controversy between China and the NBA on Monday, saying that Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey \"wasn't educated\" when he sent a tweet in support of protesters in Hong Kong this month.
