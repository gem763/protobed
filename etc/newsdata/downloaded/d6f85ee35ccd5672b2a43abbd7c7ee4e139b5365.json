Chief Executive Sheldon Adelson told Wall Street analysts he's happy to be back after a nearly yearlong absence from conference calls discussing the company's quarterly earnings.\n\nMr. Adelson, the company's 86-year-old chairman and founder, was undergoing treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma earlier this year, according to the company. The billionaire didn't discuss his health on Wednesday's call, beyond telling analysts: \"I feel good.\" The last time he joined an earnings call was in October 2018. Neither Mr. Adelson nor the company has said whether those treatments are continuing.\n\n\"I deeply appreciate the well wishes and everyone who took the time to reach out to me,\" Mr. Adelson said. \"It certainly means a lot.\"\n\nThe casino giant reported net income of $669 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, a 4.3% decline from the year-earlier period. Net revenues declined 3.6% to $3.25 billion.\n\nAsked Wednesday about recent political unrest in Hong Kong, Sands President and Chief Operating Officer Robert Goldstein indicated that the impact on the company so far has been limited. Like other gambling giants, Sands derives the majority of its revenue from Macau, which neighbors Hong Kong.\n\nThe company's Las Vegas Strip operations, including the Venetian resort, accounted for only about 10% of earnings before factoring in costs such as interest, taxes and depreciation, over the previous 12 months. Macau accounted for 60% and Singapore about 30%.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Adelson called President Trump in August to warn about economic repercussions in the U.S. from escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. A truce over tariffs has since been agreed upon this month.\n\nMr. Goldstein said Macau has proved to be a resilient market, built on a large percentage of younger, affluent customers.\n\nSands is spending an estimated $2.2 billion on new construction and renovations in the gambling enclave. They include $1.35 billion on a renovation and expansion at the rebranded Londoner Macau, $400 million on a separate 370-suite Londoner Tower Suites and $450 million on a hotel tower at the Grand Suites at Four Seasons Macau.\n\n\"We want to invest more money in Macau,\" Mr. Goldstein said.\n\nCasino operators in Macau face a deadline of June 2022, when their 20-year concessions, or licenses, expire unless the government extends the agreements.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan recently legalized casinos last year, opening the way for companies like Sands and MGM Resorts International Inc. to pursue developments there, including casino, hotel, retail and meeting spaces.\n\nIn August, Sands said it is focusing on opportunities in the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama, after initially pursuing Osaka. Mr. Goldstein said development costs for a Japanese location could exceed $10 billion, widely considered in the industry the minimum price.\n\nSands entered a development agreement with the Singapore government for a $3.3 billion expansion of its Marina Bay Sands property, continuing the company's focus on Asia. The project includes a 1,000-suite tower and entertainment arena.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotel room revenues were up 4.3% and slot machine win increased 3.4%. Like other Las Vegas casinos, the company identified conventions and meetings and entertainment as key areas of growth on the Strip.", "description": "Las Vegas Sands Corp.
