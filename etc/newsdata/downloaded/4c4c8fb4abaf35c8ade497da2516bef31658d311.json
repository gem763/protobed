The New York Times confirmed the continuation of the investigation on Sunday.\n\nState Department investigators began contacting officials about the emails some 18 months ago, the Post reported. But the effort was apparently dropped before being revived in August.\n\n\u201cAs many as 130\u201d officials have been contacted by the Trump administration since then, the paper said, adding that \u201cthose targeted were notified that emails they sent years ago have been retroactively classified and now constitute potential security violations.\u201d\n\nThe emails were largely sent between 2009 and 2013, when Clinton was secretary of state under former President Barack Obama.\n\nThis story says the State Department suddenly revived it's \"investigation\" of Hillary Clinton's emails \"in August,\" which is when the White House learned that a whistleblower had reported Trump's shakedown call with Zelensky to the CIA general counsel. https://t.co/UTFI4FLDuh \u2014 Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) September 28, 2019\n\nState Department officials denied to the Post that the probe was politically motivated. But one former senior U.S. official familiar with the investigation described it as a way for Republicans \u201cto keep the Clinton email issue alive.\u201d\n\nTrump, for one, has not dropped the matter.\n\nJust Wednesday, Trump \u2015 who\u2019s facing an impeachment inquiry following a series of troubling revelations related to a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2015 touted a baseless conspiracy theory about Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\n\u201cI think one of the great crimes committed is Hillary Clinton deleting 33,000 emails after Congress sends her a subpoena,\u201d Trump told reporters in New York while sitting alongside Zelensky ahead of a bilateral meeting, referring to a cache of emails that was deleted by a Clinton aide in 2014.\n\nTrump suggested those emails \u201ccould very well\u201d be in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump rails against Hillary Clinton over emails at #UNGA: \"It's corrupt government. Because we have corruption also... We have a lot of corruption in our government.\" pic.twitter.com/AETZbjpgiX \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) September 25, 2019\n\nClinton came under scrutiny during the 2016 presidential election for her use of a private email server to conduct State Department business \u2015 and her choice to delete emails that she\u2019d deemed personal rather than turning them over to investigators.\n\nThen-FBI Director James Comey said Clinton and her aides had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of classified information but ultimately recommended the case be closed with no charges.\n\nComey also said the FBI had found no evidence that the 33,000 deleted emails had been \u201cintentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\u201d Some of the emails were recovered by intelligence officials, NBC News noted.\n\nClinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president, has said she believes Comey\u2019s decision to send a letter to Congress about the email controversy mere days before the presidential election was a major factor contributing to her loss.\n\n\u201cAbsent that, I believe the evidence shows I would have won,\u201d Clinton said in 2017.", "description": "Dozens of current and former State Department officials have been contacted in recent weeks about emails they sent years ago to Clinton's private account.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d909b102200005a00df6e96.jpeg?cache=ryu33aqk4m&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
