USA TODAY\n\nKnowing what we now know about the boys-will-be-boys philosophy of the Houston Astros, we probably should be relieved that they finally stumbled upon the decision to fire assistant general manager Brandon Taubman for his expletive-laced tirade supporting an alleged domestic abuser directed at three journalists, all of them women, in the Astros locker room Saturday night after the American League Championship Series.\n\nThat the Astros were at least three days late in firing Taubman, and that they still botched Thursday\u2019s announcement, should surprise no one. This is a team that has been a continuing embarrassment to a sport and a league desperately in need of attracting a newer, younger, less-male audience. This is a team that has sullied the biggest week on the baseball calendar trying to cover up a self-induced public relations fiasco. This is a team that has shown an utter disregard for honesty, for fairness, for doing the right thing.\n\nBrandon Taubman, former assistant GM of the Astros.

Otherwise, \u201cpro-actively\u201d assisting an MLB investigation should pretty much be standard operating procedure for an actual MLB team.\n\nThe Astros\u2019 statement went on to say that their \u201cinitial investigation\u201d led them to believe that Taubman\u2019s \u201cinappropriate comments were not directed toward any reporter.\u201d\n\nOPINION: Astros' non-apology another sign of their unchecked arrogance\n\nAn hour or so after that statement came out, Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow actually contradicted it in front of reporters at Nationals Park, saying there was no investigation by the organization.\n\nLet\u2019s pause for a moment to consider just how inept the leadership of the Astros must be to take all that time to try to get it right, and still get it wrong. The whole bumbling Astros organization must be stuck in the seventh inning of World Series Game 2, unable to escape.\n\nBut since the statement did talk of an \u201cinitial investigation,\u201d if it had happened, this is how it would have gone:\n\nAstros: Brandon, did you scream, \u201cThank God we got (Roberto) Osuna! I\u2019m so (bleeping) glad we got Osuna!\u201d over and over at three reporters?\n\nTaubman: No.\n\nAstros: Okay, great, we\u2019re done with our investigation. Now we\u2019ll attack the Sports Illustrated reporter who broke the news.\n\nIn their Thursday statement, the Astros did say that they were wrong about this, and \u201csincerely\u201d apologized to SI\u2019s Stephanie Apstein, who exhibited the professionalism, grace and class to try to get a comment from the Astros Monday before writing even one word about this troubling incident, only to be trashed by the Astros PR people, who really should be joining Taubman in finding a new line of work.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to that Monday statement. The Astros called Apstein\u2019s story \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible,\u201d then proceeded to make up a story to cover for Taubman. \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated\u2019s attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\u201d\n\nLies, all lies. Anyone who wrote this, read this or approved this should not be allowed to work another day for the Astros. Lo and behold, one of those people was Luhnow, who admitted Thursday, \u201cI saw it before it went out.\u201d\n\nThis is a big deal. What say you, Astros ownership and MLB? Are you really serious about this issue? If so, how does Luhnow escape punishment?\n\nAlso in their new statement, the Astros said they \u201cin no way intended to minimize the issues related to domestic violence.\u201d\n\nOf course they did. This is another flat-out lie. Minimizing domestic violence is exactly what the Astros did when they signed Osuna, who was suspended for 75 games under MLB\u2019s domestic violence policy in 2018 for allegedly assaulting the mother of his then-3-year-old child.\n\nIt\u2019s what they are doing during the Series by having Osuna still on their roster as their closer. Someone should tell the Astros they actually have the ability to get rid of Osuna right now if they wanted to show how much they are not minimizing domestic violence.\n\nWhile the Astros have shown themselves to be entirely out of their league in 21st century America, they were exposed this week by dozens of journalists, women and men, who called out their lies on Twitter. The social media onslaught, so heartening on behalf of women in sports media, must have shocked them.\n\nThe Astros thought they were living in a different world, a world where lying and covering up and supporting alleged domestic abusers is still accepted.
