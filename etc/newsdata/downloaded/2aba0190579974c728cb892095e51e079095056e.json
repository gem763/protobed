It was directly above a hotplate for cooking food.\n\nThe painting is thought to be part of a large diptych dating from 1280 when Cimabue, also known as Cenni di Pepo, painted eight scenes depicting Christ\u2019s passion and crucifixion.\n\nTwo other scenes from the work hang in the National Gallery in London \u2013 The Virgin and Child with Two Angels \u2013 and the Frick Collection in New York (The Flagellation of Christ).\n\nThe scene in the National Gallery was also lost for centuries, and found only when a British aristocrat was clearing his ancestral seat in Suffolk. It was given to the nation in 2000.\n\nThe French painting\u2019s owner thought it was just a rather old religious icon when she took it to her local auctioneers to be valued.\n\nEarly Renaissance art was hugely influenced by Byzantine art, which is still produced in a similar style today on a background of gold paint. However, tests using infrared light found that there was \u201cno disputing that the painting was done by the same hand\u201d as other known works by Cimabue, said art expert Eric Turquin.\n\nIt will go under the hammer at the Acteon auction house in Senlis, north of Paris, on 27 October.", "description": "Christ Mocked, by the 13th-century painter Cimabue, could be worth up to \u20ac6m", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Paris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e14f8533a8c8782f7ea3802353e48e5f5459a312/0_352_5800_3480/master/5800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=954ed4b0f356a13a128ab54df7552f2c", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
