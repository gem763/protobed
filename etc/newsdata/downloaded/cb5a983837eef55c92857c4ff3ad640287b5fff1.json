But there's more work to do.\n\n\"There are buildings still on the Heritage at Risk Register that can be rescued and can be brought back to beneficial use and generate an income, contributing to the local community and economy.\"", "description": "England's oldest surviving timber trestle bridge, a 19th century lighthouse and a military complex built during the Napoleonic Wars are in danger of being lost forever if not given funds for restoration, according to Historic England.", "authors": ["Jamie Johnson", "Sajid Javid", "Allister Heath"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/16/DP248868-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-yKXUOr_MwQ_nCnkwkIf1K3XIjfGrkZyYeXKzNXbyE0.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
