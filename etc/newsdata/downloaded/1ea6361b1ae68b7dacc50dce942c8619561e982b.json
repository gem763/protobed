The Government wants tech to let it access encrypted messages and claims encryption helps cyber criminals.\n\nA statement from the Five Eyes alliance of the UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand last year said they \u201cencourage information and communications technology service providers to voluntarily establish lawful access solutions to their products\u201d.\n\nTwo staff at the National Cyber Security Centre, part of GCHQ, suggested messaging firms add security services as a \u201cghost\u201d recipient of encrypted messages. But firms including Apple, Microsoft and WhatsApp said the proposal could \u201cthreaten fundamental human rights\u201d.\n\nLady Kidron has urged firms to implement PhotoDNA, a service developed by Microsoft in 2009 that can automatically remove images of child sexual abuse.", "description": "A leading child safety campaigner says the Government is using \u201cthe shield and sympathy\u201d of child sexual abuse as an excuse to access encrypted messages.", "authors": ["James Cook", "James Titcomb"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2016/04/19/BTFANC_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoC1KLvdKTc_v1L1R92-Vtfv18YlR_ZdAeGXxy7N0ppo.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
