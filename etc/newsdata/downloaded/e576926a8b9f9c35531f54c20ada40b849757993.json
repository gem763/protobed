YouTube/War on Fear\n\nBeijing \u2014 China's government on Monday denounced U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for saying that Beijing is trying to erase Muslim culture in its northwest. A foreign ministry spokesman rejected Pompeo's comment at the United Nations that the detention of Uighurs was unrelated to anti-terrorism activity.\n\nThe verbal jousting comes amid new evidence to challenge China's insistence that the hundreds of thousands of Uighurs are being \"re-educated\" in camps \u2014 not imprisoned.\n\nPompeo on Sunday called on Central Asian governments to reject Chinese demands that they send home ethnic minorities who might face repression in China. Pompeo said China is trying \"to erase\" minority cultures and religions.\n\nThe ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Chinese activities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where Muslims are held in detention camps, are the same as de-radicalization efforts in other countries.\n\nChina separating Muslim children from families\n\nGeng complained that American politicians \"slandered China's policy toward Xinjiang and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs.\"\n\n\"These measures are no different in nature from the deradicalization and preventive counterterrorism measures taken by many other countries, including the United States,\" Geng said at a regular news briefing. \"The lies of U.S. politicians can't deceive the world and only further reveals their ulterior political goals.\"\n\nBut the Chinese government's latest defense of the Xinjiang camps comes on the heels of a claim by an Australian analyst who found video purportedly showing hundreds of Uighur men being herded like prisoners at a train station in the province.\n\n4 days ago a video showing 3-400 detainees handcuffed & blindfolded at a train station in Xinjiang was uploaded to YouTube (https://t.co/GpEaZ7YkIK)\n\nIn this thread I'll share how I've verified that this video was filmed at \u5e93\u5c14\u52d2\u897f\u7ad9 (41.8202, 86.0176) on or around August 18th. pic.twitter.com/hr5xd8nahM \u2014 Nathan Ruser (@Nrg8000) September 21, 2019\n\nAnalyst Nathan Ruser, who works for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute's International Cyber Policy Center, has studied satellite imagery for years in an effort to track the development of the secretive \"re-education camps\" in northwest China. On Saturday he posted a series of messages on Twitter explaining the technical means he used to conclude that the video was shot in August of 2018 at a train station near the city of Korla, in Xinjiang.\n\nHe said the video, shot by a drone and uploaded to a relatively new YouTube account on September 17, shows between 300 and 400 Uighur men, blindfolded and handcuffed, being closely guarded and led around a train station in Xinjiang.\n\nRuser said that while the Chinese government has taken \"journalists and diplomats on very guided, very manicured tours around the region, to particular camps to highlight what they call progress and human rights in the region\u2026this video undercuts that narrative and shows clearly the very inhumane treatment that detained individuals get in the system.\"\n\nHis report has gotten the attention of Australian officials.\n\nRare look at China's efforts to silence Muslim minority group\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Marise Payne told Australian network ABC in response to their report highlighting Ruser's findings that the video was \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\n\"I have previously raised Australia's concerns about reports of mass detentions of Uyghurs and other Muslim peoples in Xinjiang,\" ABC quoted Payne as saying on Monday. \"We have consistently called for China to cease the arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and other Muslim groups. We have raised these concerns \u2014 and we will continue to raise them \u2014 both bilaterally and in relevant international meetings.\"", "description": "But amid the war of words over secretive \"re-education\" camps, video has emerged challenging Beijing's insistence that they're not prisons", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/23/b5ae8455-9072-407b-aacb-67cbf27fd52a/thumbnail/1200x630/9a2f45c9fd31d6d9a9f12bcd1c4e1f68/china-xinjiang-uighurs-purported-video.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
