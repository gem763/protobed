They also asked for more information regarding the U.S. delegation to the Ukrainian president's inauguration in May and a potential visit of Zelensky to the U.S. for an Oval Office meeting with Trump, among other things.\n\n\"Secretary Pompeo's obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry does not alleviate you of your independent legal obligation to produce to the Committees any responsive documents in your personal possession, custody, or control,\" the chairmen wrote to Sondland.\n\n\"There is no valid basis to withhold documents from the Committees by relying on instructions from Secretary Pompeo, who is a fact witness in this inquiry and who is currently defying his own duly issued subpoena for documents \u2014 particularly if the Department's goal is to block the Committees from gaining access to your documents prior to your testimony.\"", "description": "Democrats warned that if Gordon Sondland fails to comply with the subpoena, it would strengthen their case for obstruction by the president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4218122/1000x563_nbc-191008-gordon-sondland-trump-ew-611p_09cc49df46f17341ca136bb86a6d6bca.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
