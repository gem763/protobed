PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Zach Parise scored the go-ahead goal midway through the third period and the Minnesota Wild won their second game of the season, beating the Montreal Canadiens 4-3 on Sunday.\n\nJason Zucker, Marcus Foligno and Brad Hunt also scored for Minnesota, which matched its highest goal total through eight games this season. The Wild also scored four goals in a 7-4 home loss to Pittsburgh.\n\nDevan Dubnyk made 29 saves and earned his first win of the season.\n\nPhillip Danault scored twice and Tomas Tatar added a goal for the Canadiens. Keith Kinkaid stopped 29 shots in his second game of the season.\n\nParise took a perfect pass from Zucker through traffic and sent a shot that beat Kinkaid and gave the Wild a 4-3 lead. The score came just over four minutes after Hunt tied the game on the power play.\n\nThe teams squared off for the second time in a four-day span. The host Canadiens won the previous meeting 4-0.\n\nFoligno scored with just 12.9 seconds left in the second period to tie the game. Danault\u2019s second goal of the game in the third gave Montreal a short-lived lead before goals by Hunt and Parise put Minnesota ahead for good.\n\nZucker opened the game with a first-period goal in the team\u2019s first game since the player included head coach Bruce Boudreau in a controversial quote, saying everyone on the team needed to be better. Zucker redirected a shot from the point on the power play at 8:57.\n\nAll three of Zucker\u2019s goals this season have come on the power play.\n\nThe finest of Kinkaid\u2019s saves on Sunday came when he stopped Zucker midway through the second period. As he fell to the ice, Kinkaid gloved a shot by Zucker that would have tied the game.\n\nMontreal scored twice in a 16-second span in the second period. Tatar evened the game with a power-play goal at the 2:50 mark. Dubnyk gave up a big rebound to Tatar, who buried it for his third goal of the year.\n\nThen Danault put Montreal up 2-1 after a turnover by Minnesota in its own zone. Danault banked the puck off Dubnyk\u2019s skate seconds after Tatar\u2019s equalizer.\n\nNOTES: The Wild\u2019s regular-season sellout streak ended at 230 consecutive games. Sunday\u2019s announced attendance of 17,344 fell short of the Xcel Energy Center\u2019s capacity of 17,954. \u2026 Sunday was Minnesota\u2019s second home game of the season through eight games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCanadiens: Host San Jose on Thursday night.\n\nWild: Host Edmonton on Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Zach Parise scored the go-ahead goal midway through the third period and the Minnesota Wild won their second game of the season, beating the Montreal Canadiens 4-3 on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tyler Mason"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/canadiens_wild_hockey_47595_c0-104-2474-1547_s1200x700.jpg?f2068708ef413edba0e497f6676caa19738a2459", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
