And that\u2019s certainly still the case here. Rather than directly calling Trump out for his decision to pull troops from northern Syria \u2014 a move that is apparently paving the way for Turkey to target the United States\u2019 Kurdish allies who led the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, and that some worry could revitalize it \u2014 they\u2019ll often cite the \u201cadministration\u201d or broadly express concern about the Kurds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut even the things they are saying strongly suggest that the president they support will soon have blood on his hands. They\u2019ll never say it in so many words, perhaps, but that\u2019s really what they\u2019re saying, for all intents and purposes.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria is having sickening and predictable consequences,\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3-ranking House Republican, said Wednesday. She added: \u201cThe U.S. is abandoning our ally the Kurds, who fought ISIS on the ground and helped protect the U.S. homeland. This decision aids America\u2019s adversaries, Russia, Iran, and Turkey, and paves the way for a resurgence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe derision extends to Trump\u2019s most devoted base, evangelical Christians. The Rev. Franklin Graham echoed what many evangelicals have been saying Wednesday: \u201cThe Kurds are the ones who have been leading the fight against ISIS in Syria. Also pray for the Christians who the Kurds have been protecting. They could be annihilated. Would you pray w/me that Pres. \u2066\u202a@realDonaldTrump\u202c\u2069 will reconsider? Thousands of lives hang in the balance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Kurds are the ones who have been leading the fight against ISIS in Syria.

Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) warned Monday, \u201cIf the President sticks with this retreat, he needs to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children.\u201d\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said via Twitter that the \u201cadministration\u201d had \u201ccut [a] deal with Erdogan allowing him to wipe [the Kurds] out.\u201d He added that \u201cthis is not a matter of if many ISIS fighters break out, it\u2019s a matter of when.\u201d\n\nAt request of this administration the Kurds served as the primary ground fighters against ISIS in Syria so U.S. troops wouldn\u2019t have to.\n\n\n\nThen cut deal with Erdogan allowing him to wipe them out.\n\n\n\nDamage to our reputation & national interest will be extraordinary & long lasting. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 9, 2019\n\nAs I pointed out two days ago in the attached R/T this is not a matter of if many ISIS fighters break out, its a matter of when. https://t.co/3OM7USrf7p pic.twitter.com/xSVhcWBcpP \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 9, 2019\n\nSo Trump cut a deal that will lead to mass death, and terrorists will be freed, at which point they can target the West. Rubio didn\u2019t say Trump, but he said a lot.\n\nSome of these politicians might dress it up, but what they\u2019re saying, strictly speaking, is that Trump has made a decision that could well lead to a mass slaughter of U.S. allies and also increase the threat from the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world. They\u2019re saying that people will die, perhaps en masse, and that Trump\u2019s decision increases the danger to the Western world and Americans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven Trump seemed to concede the latter point Wednesday, suggesting that Islamic State fighters might go to Europe.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe; that\u2019s where they want to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to go back to their homes, but Europe didn\u2019t want them from us.\u201d\n\nIf it happens \u2014 or if the dire predictions about the Kurds come true \u2014 how can Republicans then turn around and say Trump is the steady leader this country needs? How can they argue that \u201csocialism\u201d is worse than an increased terrorist threat and/or the mass death of U.S. allies whom they said Trump, practically speaking, sent to their own slaughter? Most of them still probably would, almost certainly, but that argument would carry significant cognitive dissonance. The quotes above would certainly loom large in Democratic arguments that Trump has proved to be genuinely dangerous.\n\nTo this point in his presidency, despite his many controversies, Trump has avoided a true catastrophe involving massive loss of life that can be directly chalked up to the federal government. Whatever you think of this decision, he has walked into a scenario in which that could well be the case \u2014 and even his allies are predicting it pretty unmistakably.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump has made one of the riskiest decisions of his presidency.
