If you are holding an event or attending one, please still go ahead.\n\n\"\u00a3500,000 is enough to cover the treatment and care Oscar would require if all went to plan.\n\n(Image: Olivia Saxelby / SWNS)\n\n(Image: Worcester News / SWNS)\n\n\"Now we need to make sure that we have contingency funds available should Oscar need more care or have a more complicated recovery whilst there. \"\n\nThe pair added that they may require extra funds to cover any future hurdles.\n\nThey said: \"As you will have seen from Oscar's Facebook page, Oscar has needed to receive more treatment and have further tests done whilst we have been fundraising to keep his leukaemia at bay.\n\n\"Now we have the difficult bit, the waiting.\n\n\"The initial funds are ready. Oscar's medical team now need to wait for the results of his further tests, which determine the next steps.\n\n(Image: David Dunbar / SWNS)\n\n(Image: Olivia Saxelby / SWNS)\n\n\"When the best treatment plan for Oscar is confirmed by his medical team, having this funding will allow us to move very quickly.\n\n\"Thank you so much to the people of Worcestershire and beyond for making this possible and once again doing everything in their power to help save our boy.\"\n\nOscar's appeal was backed by the Grace Kelly Childhood Cancer Trust, which has been collecting money on the family's behalf.\n\nFounder, Dr Jen Kelly, said: \"On behalf of the trust, I would like to thank everyone that has supported Oscar's campaign in any way.\n\n\"In particular mentioning the amazing team at Pitmaston Primary School, both the staff and parents who have gone to the most extraordinary lengths to make Oscar's huge campaign a reality.\n\n\"The Grace Kelly Childhood Cancer Trust is very proud to have been able to play a key role in Oscar's campaign and we will continue to help support Oscar and other children affected by childhood cancer wherever possible.\"", "description": "Oscar Saxelby-Lee, from Worcester, can now undergo cutting-edge therapy in Singapore to tackle a rare form of cancer", "authors": ["Mark Cardwell", "Matthew Dresch", "Alicia Kelly", "Image", "Olivia Saxel", "Swns", "Worcester News", "David Dunbar"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528008.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_SAXELBY_FUNDRAISING_05.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
