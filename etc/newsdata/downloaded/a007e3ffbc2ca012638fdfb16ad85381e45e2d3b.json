The complaint reported an \"urgent concern\" about Mr. Trump's request for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pelosi announced the House is launching a formal impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, setting up a dramatic constitutional clash just over a year before the presidential election.\n\n\"Today I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,\" Pelosi said at the Capitol late Tuesday afternoon. The inquiry marks just the fourth time in American history a president has faced a viable threat of impeachment.\n\nOther moderate Republican governors have yet to weigh in on an impeachment inquiry.\n\nWhen pressed by reporters, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said Wednesday he was withholding judgment.
