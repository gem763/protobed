They demanded that the company agree to a new labor agreement by Sept. 14. The company broke the deadline Sunday morning. The strike affects about 46,000 hourly workers, per Axios' Joann Muller.\n\nUnder the existing labor contract, GM can't close plants, except in the case of a sudden market downturn. However, the UAW sued GM for violating the agreement, saying the company was using semantics to idle plants.\n\nThe UAW is demanding fairer wages, affordable health care, profits, job security and a path for permanent positions for temporary employees.\n\nThe UAW hoped that a new labor contract for its GM members would set the standards for all labor contracts in the industry, benefitting its members who work at Ford and Fiat Chrysler.\n\nYes, but: The union's position in negotiations was hit by a scandal involving misappropriation of union funds that implicates union president Gary Jones.\n\nFederal authorities accused Jones of helping current and former senior union officials embezzle member dues to buy personal luxuries, according to the Detroit News.\n\nWhat they're saying: Dittes told members in a letter after final negotiations on Saturday night that the union and company remained divided. He said the company would not receive an extension.\n\nThe union vice president accused GM of refusing \"to put hard working Americans ahead of their record profits of $35 billion in North America over the last three years.\"\n\nGM, the largest US automaker, said in a statement that it is still willing to work to reach a deal to build \"a strong future for our employees and our business.\"\n\nPresident Trump tweeted, \"Here we go again with General Motors and the United Auto Workers. Get together and make a deal!\"\n\nGo deeper: GM to cut workers, idle U.S. manufacturing plants\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with President Trump's tweet.", "description": "UAW's GM members are steaming about the firm's move to \"unallocate\" 5 plants.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/owq5FDgmHL4FyDbR1CfalTDRx74=/0x328:4000x2578/1920x1080/2019/09/16/1568609989163.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
