He hates it, he doesn't want to do that in the living room.\n\n\"It'd be a massive step to be able to do all those normal things again.\"\n\nHull City Council said: \"Because of Blake's considerable disabilities now and in anticipation of his future needs, it is proposed to build for the family a significant extension.\n\n\"However it has proved difficult to get the required size of extension into the triangular shape of the family\u2019s garden.\n\n\"This has required further careful planning and a new solution has been proposed. Unfortunately, assessing, planning and undertaking works of this nature can take time. It is anticipated that actual construction will start in the new year.\"\n\nBut Blake's stepdad Joseph questioned that proposed start date after a surveyor who visited them last week told them that previous measurements had been incorrect.\n\n(Image: xxxxxxxxx WS)\n\n\"They told us that before the new surveyor came but he's come along and said it's all wrong,\" he said.\n\n\"The council has already said our current situation is unlivable and they can't relocate us anywhere.\n\n\"It's ridiculously frustrating, just giving us a start date would make it so much more comforting.\"\n\nAnd he said the delays had been made worse by the most recent surveyor not having any contact with them for nearly two months.\n\nAfter trying to get hold of him since May, Joseph said he spent just 10 minutes at the house during his visit on October 14.\n\nHe said that when Kirsty asked the surveyor when the changes were likely to be made, he replied: \"Not any time soon, love.\"\n\nJoseph said: \"Kirsty was beside herself, she couldn't believe it.\n\n(Image: Joseph Dowell)\n\n\"They're meant to be professionals, people we rely on. And especially when working with disabilities they're absolutely integral to everyday life and getting the job right is vital.\n\n\"And maybe not just getting it right, but having a bit of empathy too.\n\n\"But rocking up after months and saying that, when we already struggle as a family, it's absolutely unforgivable.\"\n\nThe family are now fundraising for treatments for Blake that are not available on the NHS.\n\nAnyone wanting to support them can donate to their GoFundMe page here .", "description": "Blake Hostick, six, was left unable to walk, eat or talk after complications with the flu resulted in him contracting an ultra-rare neurological condition", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Xxxxxxxxx Ws", "Joseph Dowell"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20720972.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Flu-son.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
