One way of doing this is the so-called exploit tactics. American companies spend millions on ways to combat computer exploits used for cyber attacks. This has \u201cinspired Chinese hackers to build a secret path to garnish those resources for their own,\u201d Check Point said.\n\nUNCLE SAM WANTS HACKERS TO HELP IT BOLSTER US NATIONAL SECURITY\n\nThe report cites a blog from cybersecurity giant Symantec outlining an NSA (National Security Agency)-like exploit used by a Chinese state-sponsored group named APT3 prior to 2017, the year in which a number of NSA exploits were leaked by a group named The Shadow Brokers.\n\n\u201cThe leak of NSA tools by the Shadow Brokers in 2017 has shown how the US has immense in-house exploit [capabilities]. The Chinese would obviously want to get to the same capabilities, but their way to gain those powers is different from that of the U.S.\u201d the report said.\n\nCheck Point: how the Chinese do it\n\nCheck Point Research analyzed the malicious tool used by APT3 and learned that the Chinese group was monitoring computers that were compromised by the NSA, capturing traffic from the attack then leveraging it to reverse engineer vulnerabilities.\n\nUS EYES RANSOMWARE THREAT TO VOTER DATABASES PRIOR TO 2020 ELECTION\n\nUsually, these tools are built in-house or purchased from a third party, Check Point said. But in this case the tools obtained by the Chinese are reverse engineered from the U.S. for use in their own hacking arsenal, according to Check Point.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese were able to build their own exploitation tool that looked almost the same as the American one but was actually built in China,\u201d the report said.\n\n\"This...suggests a narrative where China and the US are engaged in a cyber arms race to develop new exploits,\" the report added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News has reached out to the Chinese government with a request for comment on this story.", "description": "China is now trying to hack into U.S. networks to exploit the ongoing trade war, experts say.", "authors": ["Brooke Crothers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/a3b62dad-chinaflaghall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
