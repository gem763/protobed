They're worn to disguise protesters from the police and prevent arrest.\n\nSome of Saturday's protesters did defiantly wear face masks, although some were the smaller surgical masks which are more commonly used to protect against illnesses.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s metro system also stayed shut on Saturday, paralysing transport in the Asian financial hub.\n\nMTR Corp said its network, which carries about five million passengers each day, would remain suspended, while shopping malls and supermarkets also closed, in a new blow for retailers and restaurants in a city on the edge of recession.\n\n\u201cAs we are no longer in a position to provide safe and reliable service to passengers in the circumstances, the corporation had no choice but to make the decision to suspend the service of its entire network,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nFriday\u2019s protests across the Chinese-ruled city erupted hours after its embattled leader, Carrie Lam, invoked colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years to ban the face masks demonstrators use to hide their identities.\n\nThe night\u2019s \u201cextreme violence\u201d justified the use of the emergency law, Beijing-backed Lam said in a television address on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe radical behaviour of rioters took Hong Kong through a very dark night, leaving society today half-paralysed,\u201d she said in pre-recorded remarks.\n\n\u201cThe extreme violence clearly illustrated that Hong Kong\u2019s public safety is widely endangered. That\u2019s the concrete reason that we had to invoke emergency law yesterday to introduce the anti-mask law.\u201d\n\nThe increasingly violent demonstrations that have roiled the city for four months began in opposition to a bill introduced in April that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, but they have since spiralled into a broader pro-democracy movement.\n\nThe unrest has plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis since its handover from Britain to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that granted it autonomy and broad freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina\u2019s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said on Friday the protests were evolving into a revolution backed by foreign forces and could not continue indefinitely.", "description": "After a night of unrest, protesters return to the city's streets, this time peacefully.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/83/42/1000x563_cmsv2_c501552a-7bef-5f11-94b1-ea07dcc210aa-4208342.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
