Many are hired by recruitment companies which specialise in Asian labour, whose number has exploded.\n\n\u201cAt first we were solicited for small projects, but for the past three years the demand for workers for large projects has increased significantly,\u201d Corina Constantin, director of recruiter Multi Professional Solutions, tells AFP.\n\nAccording to a 2018 study by US-based ManpowerGroup, four out of five Romanian employers have difficulties in filling posts.\n\nWith a total workforce of 5.1 million, the country \u2014 one of the poorest in Europe \u2014 lacks an estimated 300,000 workers, according to industry groups.\n\n\u201cAll sectors are affected but things are particularly bad in industries, where there are strict deadlines and contracts to be respected throughout the year,\u201d Christian Parvan, vice-president of the Association of Entrepreneurs, tells AFP.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Abusive behaviour\u2019 \u2013\n\nParvan says foreign workers get \u201ctreated well\u201d, and their employers try to integrate them in the conservative EU member state, which unlike many other European countries has not seen a surge of nationalist sentiment.\n\nBaluta, the Bucharest district mayor, says 500-odd Vietnamese employed in construction in his district receive the equivalent of 900 euros ($1,000) net per month, one third higher than the average salary in Romania.\n\nBut trade unionist Dumitru Costin criticises what he describes as \u201cabusive behaviour\u201d by many employers, adding that the Asian workforce \u201cis much, much cheaper than the local one\u201d.\n\nHe says labour inspectors cannot check whether the \u201cminimum standards\u201d of conditions for workers are respected because it is impossible to communicate directly with the employees.\n\n\u201cWhen they have travelled thousands of miles to find a job, it is obvious that they will obey without flinching and work unpaid overtime for fear of being sent back to their country,\u201d says Costin, who heads SNB, one of the country\u2019s main trade union confederations.\n\nAcross the border in Hungary, trade unionists make the same accusations.\n\nEmployers \u201cexploit the language barriers by faking even their working papers\u201d, says Pallagi, the head of the construction workers\u2019 union.\n\nZoltan Laszlo, head of the Metallurgical Trade Union, says Hungarian employees likewise are under pressure from their bosses who tell them they are \u201ceasily replaceable\u201d by Ukrainians, Mongolians or Vietnamese.", "description": "Bucharest (AFP) \u2013 Sporting yellow safety helmets, about 30 men are busy at work on a construction site south of Bucharest, exchanging a few words in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/41e3be_bucharest-was-forced-recruit-far-eu-borders-workers-local-mayor-romania-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
