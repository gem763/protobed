He had gotten married just a month earlier.\n\nThe Indian Navy reported that the fire had not seriously damaged the combat capabilities of the vessel, which is India\u2019s only operational carrier. The 45,000-ton Vikramaditya \u2013 the ex-Soviet carrier Admiral Gorshkov -- had just completed a deployment in the Arabian Sea, and was preparing to begin joint exercises with the French Navy\u2019s only aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, off the Indian coast.\n\nThe cause of the fire has not yet been disclosed. But Chinese media quickly ran a story that suggested the fire was the result of Indian incompetence. Li Jie, a Chinese naval expert, told the state-owned Global Times newspaper \u201cthat the fire was more likely to be out of human error rather than mechanical problems. The fire and the extinguishing process suggested that they are unprofessional and unprepared to address such an emergency, he said.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndia has been actively developing its military in recent years, but \u2018its military culture is lax and it has loose regulations,\u2019 which cannot effectively train soldiers to operate advanced military equipment, Li said.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Beijing didn't mince words.", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jWPP5kHGfXna6_z.sYFr7A--~B/aD04MTA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/32e72a078d7557153fb121632da4439d", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
