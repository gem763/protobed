About 1 in 5 said they remain undecided, and nearly two-thirds of Democrats and independents said they could still change their minds.\n\nMany of the candidates, including Buttigieg, O'Rourke and Harris, are still relatively unknown to a majority of Americans, and only about 1 in 10 said they watched this week's Democratic debate in Ohio.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,116 adults in all, including 703 Democrats and independents. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Chris Kahn; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden expanded his lead over more than a dozen other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination this month as U.S. House Democrats looked into allegations that President Donald Trump tried to pressure a foreign leader to investigate him, according to a Reuters/Ipsos", "authors": ["Chris Kahn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/krAbWr6_FTMo92.oTNyURw--~B/aD02MjA7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/9a2f16290ebc69ee64e2a2362b2554c9", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
