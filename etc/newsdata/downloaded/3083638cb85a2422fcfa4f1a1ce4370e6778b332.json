XRP price remains well supported on the downside near the $0.2750 level.\n\nRipple Price Analysis\n\nYesterday, we saw a nice upward move in ripple price above the $0.2560 resistance against the US Dollar. Later, Ethereum and bitcoin followed and started a nice upward move above $180 and $8,200 respectively. It sparked more gains in XRP/USD above the $0.2750 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Moreover, the price broke the $0.2800 and $0.2820 resistance levels.\n\nFinally, ripple traded to a new weekly high at $0.2853 and it seems like it could correct higher. The stated $0.2850 area is a major resistance, suggesting a possible downside correction. The price is currently trading below the $0.2820 level. Moreover, it broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $0.2716 low to $0.2853 high.\n\nIt seems like there is a rising channel forming with support near $0.2780 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The channel support coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $0.2716 low to $0.2853 high. If there is a downside break below the chancel support, ripple price could correct lower towards the $0.2750 support area. Any further losses may perhaps start an extended downside correction towards the key $0.2650 support (the previous resistance).\n\nOn the upside, the key resistance area is near the $0.2850 level. If there is a clear break above the $0.2850 resistance, the price could rise another 5% and trade towards the $0.2920 and $0.2950 resistance levels.\n\nLooking at the chart, ripple price is trading nicely above the $0.2780 and $0.2750 support levels. However, the $0.2850 level is a key barrier for more gains. Therefore, there are chances of a short term downside correction towards $0.2780 or $0.2750. On the upside, a solid rally above $0.2850 could even set the pace for a move towards $0.3000.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is about to move into the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is currently correcting lower towards the 60 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $0.2780, $0.2750 and $0.2720.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.2850, $0.2920 and $0.2950.", "description": "Ripple price is up more than 5% against the US Dollar, and it recovered vs bitcoin.
