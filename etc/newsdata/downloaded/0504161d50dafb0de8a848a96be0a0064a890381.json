President Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s election brought the party back into power in 2012.\n\nBut while campaigning, then-candidate Pe\u00f1a Nieto specifically named three young Mexican governors as exemplary figures in \u201cthe new PRI.\u201d\n\nAll three governors turned out to be criminals. And then became fugitives.\n\n\u201cThese detentions are a firm and forceful message from the Mexican State against impunity,\u201d the president said on Monday\u2014not mentioning Yarrington or Duarte by name\u2014before swiftly moving on to other matters.\n\nBut all across Mexico this week, the people were skeptical. And the country has been bubbling with questions.\n\n***\n\nAccording to current Tamaulipas governor Francisco Garc\u00eda Cabeza de Vaca, Yarrington, who left his post five years ago, was under the official protection of the state government until as recently as last October, when his security detail was finally revoked\u2014roughly the same time Governor Duarte fled Veracruz, and then the country.\n\nYarrington, who ran the state bordering Texas from 1999 to 2005, was often praised by then-Texas Governor George W. Bush, who called him \u201ca friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomas [Yarrington] is terrific, worked with him a lot,\u201d Bush said in 2000, just months before his election as the 43rd U.S. president. Bush, at the time, had even personally reached out to the now-disgraced governor to request leniency for several Texas residents who illegally brought guns into Mexico.\n\nBut that, of course, was before it became known that Yarrington\u2019s campaign was funded by the Gulf cartel, which then thrived and expanded under official protection, as its gruesome death squad\u2014the fearsome paramilitary-styled Zetas\u2014broke off to form their own cartel.\n\nThe former governor is wanted in both the U.S. and Mexico on charges related to drug trafficking, organized crime, and money laundering. And both countries will be contending for custody of the criminal politician, whose extradition will be decided by a Florence appeals court.\n\nBut Yarrington has been long forgotten as just another corrupt dinosaur politician.\n\nThis week, the spotlight was on rosey-cheeked Javier Duarte, the greasy 43-year-old former governor of Veracruz, whose creepy facial tick\u2014inopportune smiling\u2014was on full display as he sat handcuffed this weekend, in the custody of Guatemalan Interpol.\n\nNews of his arrest, rather than serve as a \u201cforceful\u201d blow to corruption as the president hoped, has served to fuel a number of raging and widely varying theories\u2014none too outlandish to be believed in a country where the wildest stories have become official truths.\n\nMexico, remember, allowed its last most wanted fugitive, \u201cEl Chapo\u201d, to escape\u2014not once, but twice\u2014from maximum security prison. First, the government claims, in a laundry cart, then years later through the shower drain in his prison cell, which led to a mile-long tunnel burrowed underneath the prison.\n\nIn Mexico, the word unbelievable is often meant literally.\n\nThe story of the arrest on Guatemalan soil of Mexico\u2019s most wanted man since El Chapo, Javier Duarte\u2014who somehow managed to remain fugitive for even longer than that fugitive, the world\u2019s most powerful drug lord since Pablo Escobar\u2014has sparked equal incredulity this week.\n\nDuarte, Mexico\u2019s villain du jour, has been accused of everything from replacing chemotherapy drugs for dying children with an inert saline solution\u2014as alleged by his successor, Governor Miguel Angel Yunes\u2014to granting a dozen dubious contracts to the Brazilian engineering giant Odebrecht, which on Monday was fined an unprecedented $2.6 billion by a U.S. judge for bribing officials in a dozen Latin American countries, including $10 million doled out to Mexican officials.\n\nBut, mostly, Duarte\u2019s name has become synonymous with one thing: stealing.\n\nLots of stealing. Unprecedented stealing.\n\n***\n\nThe people of Mexico, from laymen to politicians, have spent years calling Duarte a criminal.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until May of last year\u2014when investigative journalists at Animal Politico dropped a bombshell report revealing the vast network of collaborators facilitating Duarte\u2019s efforts to bleed his state dry\u2014that the proof became undeniable.\n\nDuarte is accused of leaving the state of Veracruz near-destitute, and draining public coffers for his own enrichment through a complicated scheme involving an untold number of public officials, private businesspeople, and family members.\n\nOfficially, on the lowest end of the spectrum, the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s Office has timidly accused Duarte of taking about $22 million from the state.\n\nBut, less forgiving estimates, like that of Mexico\u2019s Federal Auditor\u2019s Office, have calculated the drain on federal and state funds at well over $3 billion missing or misappropriated during just three years of Duarte\u2019s nearly-six-year term.\n\nJuan Manuel Portal, who heads the government office, called the theft \u201chistoric\u201d last November. But the staggering sum of state and federal funds that Duarte is alleged to have stolen or otherwise diverted from Veracruz is still being tallied.\n\nAccording to Arturo Angel, a reporter for Animal Politico\u2014the news organization that first evidenced the breadth of the governor\u2019s impropriety last May\u2014the latest total has reached an unfathomable 73 billion pesos.\n\nThat\u2019s roughly $3.8 billion.\n\nBy that measure, Duarte was stealing about $76,000 an hour during his term as governor. Or, more than $1.8 million for each of the 2,130 days he spent in office.\n\nWorse, this theft had seemingly been an open secret for years before the news outlet revealed its enormity, precipitating the investigation that would push Duarte into hiding. Federal auditors had been aware of the inconsistencies since 2012, but their complaints had been consistently and officially ignored.\n\nWhen the governor finally stepped down last October, he said he was doing so to \u201cface the false accusations\u201d against him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to flee,\u201d he said in his final television interview before abruptly disappearing.\n\nThe interim governor, Flavino R\u00edos, admitted he facilitated Duarte\u2019s escape via helicopter. While in air, the helicopter changed routes several times before finally taking Duarte to a getaway car that drove him to Chiapas, where he remained until fleeing to Guatemala.\n\nLast Halloween, two weeks after he went missing, outspoken Catholic priest Alejandro Solalinde tweeted that Duarte was hiding in Chiapas, the Mexican state bordering Guatemala. Father Solalinde had received the tip from community members, he said, who had seen heavy military presence guarding the area. The priest said, then, that if Duarte left the country it would be because of the government\u2019s omission.\n\nAccording to the official version, parroted by Mexico\u2019s deputy attorney general Alberto El\u00edas Beltr\u00e1n this week, the first real clue to Duarte\u2019s whereabouts didn\u2019t come until two weeks later.\n\nOn November 10, a man was arrested at the Chiapas airport carrying two passports with pseudonyms and the photographs of Governor Duarte and his wife, Karime Mac\u00edas Tubillo, along with $7,500 in cash. He was released hours later and not charged with any crime.\n\nAccording to the deputy attorney general, the big break in the case, which led Mexican authorities to the Guatemalan resort where Duarte was arrested on Saturday, came the day before the arrest, when Duarte\u2019s family was briefly detained en route to Guatemala.\n\nDuarte\u2019s wife\u2019s sister, her husband, and their children boarded a plane to Guatemala from Mexico State last Friday, along with Duarte\u2019s children and mother-in-law. They were travelling with roughly $16,000 in cash\u2014a stash of euros, dollars, and pesos\u2014and were fined for the undeclared money.\n\nBut they were allowed to travel regardless, authorities said, in order to lead authorities straight to Duarte\u2019s hideout at the upscale lakeside resort in Guatemala.\n\n***\n\n\u201cJavier Duarte is on his way,\u201d wrote the Veracruz-based journalist Alejandro Aguirre Guerrero in a column for El Universal, two days before the arrest, and one day before the revealing Duarte family plane trip was booked.\n\nIn the days before the arrest, the journalist said over the phone, federal sources told him that Duarte would be \u201carrested in Central America on Saturday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was authorized to make that public,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I decided to not publish that information, because I didn\u2019t want to accidentally blow the whistle before Duarte could be brought in. I feared interfering in the arrest, or hindering justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the official version of events, there isn\u2019t any reason that [federal authorities] should have known that the family was headed to Guatemala, nor that Duarte would be detained on Saturday,\u201d he said. Although, Aguirre said, his source had told him weeks before that Duarte had \u201cpoked his head out,\u201d signaling his network of conspirators that he was running low on cash and thirsty for more.\n\nGuatemalan prosecutor Thelma Aldana Hern\u00e1ndez confirmed on Monday that authorities in her country were not asked to detain the fugitive until the day of his arrest, April 15.\u201cMy sources confirmed, as they were honing in on him, that Duarte was the only one the government would arrest\u2014not his family or wife,\u201d said Aguirre, who last year won the National Journalism Prize for his coverage of Veracruz.\n\n\u201cOne thing I considered, a logical conclusion really, is that the whole thing was arranged ahead of time,\u201d Aguirre said, echoing the theory that has resoundingly predominated this week in Mexico. \u201cThat\u2019s what this would lead you to believe. It is suspicious, really.\u201d\n\nWhen Aguirre was given the go-ahead on Thursday to publish that Duarte would be arrested on Saturday, he wondered\u2014\u201cas anyone would\u201d\u2014if perhaps he was being used by official sources, as a way to give Duarte the nod. But the journalist was judicious in what he chose to reveal publicly.\n\n\u201cI asked my source if it was planned that Duarte would agree to turn himself in in exchange for [authorities] not pursuing his family,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was unable extract a response. Not even a wink.\u201d\n\nInconsistencies and unanswered questions abound. According to Mexico\u2019s deputy attorney general, Alberto El\u00edas Beltr\u00e1n, who led the effort on Mexico\u2019s behalf, Duarte was arrested in the hotel lobby on Saturday without incident.\n\nBut the arresting officers in Guatemala said the former governor was cornered while attempting to flee the fifth floor of the hotel, after authorities deactivated the elevators and WiFi. He initially denied being Javier Duarte, they said.\n\nBut the deputy director of Interpol in Guatemala, Manuel Noriega, told the Associated Press that Duarte was asked to leave his room, and agreed to do so voluntarily. \u201cI\u2019m Javier Duarte, the governor,\u201d he allegedly said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do now but tell the truth.\u201d\n\nGuatemalan Interpol also said that someone from the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s Office called the former governor\u2019s hotel room, informed Duarte that he was surrounded, and suggested he give himself up. Authorities then met him at the door of his room, they said, but allowed him to go back inside, alone, to speak to his wife and children, before being calmly escorted downstairs.\u201cI have questions. You have questions. We all have questions,\u201d journalist Alejandro Aguirre told me. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a hole in the story.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know why he wasn\u2019t immediately deported to Mexico,\u201d he said, like Sinaloa cartel boss El Chapo was when he was detained in Guatemala in 1993 under similar circumstances. \u201cAnd why his family is still free.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\u201cI deserve abundance. I deserve abundance. I deserve abundance. I deserve abundance,\u201d read an obsessive mantra written over and over, consuming one full page of a notebook found abandoned in a large warehouse in C\u00f3rdoba, Veracruz.\n\nThe warehouse, whose contents were seized in late February and proudly presented to the press by the state\u2019s current governor Miguel Angel Yunes, was full of items ranging from personal to public property. The random surplus included over-the-top oil portraits of Duarte and his wife, art, framed family photographs, gifts, antiques, a grip of fancy pens, collectibles, sports memorabilia, hoards of dishware, boxes of school uniforms, expired goods, and dozens of wheelchairs.\n\nDuarte\u2019s wife, Karime Mac\u00edas, who headed the state\u2019s social services agency, kept meticulous notes, and appears to have left a clear trail of complicity in her husband\u2019s (alleged) crimes in the pages of her diaries.\n\nThe stash of more than a dozen notebooks\u2014whose pages are filled with lists of bank account numbers and hand-drawn maps of illegally acquired properties both foreign and domestic\u2014appear to be a roadmap of the couple\u2019s greed, written in girlish script.\n\nBut, beyond Duarte\u2019s wife, a bevy of her family members have also been tied to the governor\u2019s improprieties. Like Duarte, and his network of official collaborators, Karime\u2019s family acquired costly properties throughout the U.S. and Mexico, which have not yet been officially explained.\n\nDuring a government raid in February of a Chiapas home belonging to his in-laws, authorities discovered more than $50,000 in cash\u2014but this is, admittedly, pocket change compared to the more than $12 million in cash found stuffed inside cardboard boxes inside another raided Duarte-linked home in Mexico City.\n\nA half-dozen of Karime\u2019s family members were even on state payroll during his administration\u2014one cousin was made finance secretary, another named head of communications.\n\nThe man detained, and subsequently released, in Chiapas last October, carrying phony passports for the governor and his wife, was unveiled as Karime\u2019s cousin.\n\nAnother of her cousins who was also on the payroll, Brenda Tubilla, was linked to a shady plane-load of money that has never been fully explained.\n\nVeracruz officials were detained after flying to Mexico State from Veracruz with suitcases containing more than $1.3 million in cash. Duarte\u2019s officials claimed the cash was meant to pay for an upcoming state-programmed festival that his wife\u2019s cousin was in charge of organizing, and the money was eventually returned to the Veracruz government\u2014with interest.\n\nIn one of Karime\u2019s 2012 diary entries, photographed by the journalist Aguirre who visited the warehouse after the raid, she wrote about keeping a straight face, while dining with celebrities and reporters from TV Azteca, as rumors swirled about the plane full of cash.\n\n\u201cPieces of the puzzle began falling into place, assembling the full story of the detained airplane,\u201d reads the journal entry from the day after the discovery. \u201cThroughout this, I watched and successfully made sure that the atmosphere over dinner remained as though everything were normal (and it was!).\u201d\n\nQuoting another dinner guest, a prominent businessman married to a well-known telenovela star, she wrote, \u201cGoverning is like trying to hold up two columns made of sand at all times.\u201d\n\nShe could have guessed, then, that it would all eventually come crashing down. But likely expected it never would. \u201cThe plane belonged to the government,\u201d the journal entry concludes.\n\nKarime\u2019s parents are under investigation for Duarte-related financial crimes, and her sister and brother-in-law were travelling to Guatemala this weekend with envelopes full of excessive cash intended for Duarte. Yet, despite the doubts that have arisen about her and her family, Mexico\u2019s deputy attorney general has made it clear that they are all free to do and travel as they please.\n\nAfter Duarte told a Guatemalan judge on Wednesday that he would not accept extradition until Mexico formally submits a request\u2014which could take several weeks, but must be filed in less than 60 days\u2014Duarte\u2019s family left the continent.\n\nHis wife, children, and in-laws were spotted hours later at an airport in Colombia. From there, his children and mother-in-law reportedly flew to England.\n\n***\n\n\u201cAs a Veracruzano, I obviously celebrated his arrest just as much as anyone else. When Duarte first disappeared, it was like a weight had been lifted off our chests,\u201d Aguirre said, speaking as a journalist who watched the state transform under the disgraced politician.\n\nBeyond the theft, graft, cronyism, and corruption, Duarte leaves a tainted legacy that includes the horrific murder of no less than 17 journalists in his state during his term.\n\nBut there were others, too, like photojournalist Ruben Espinosa, who was brutally murdered alongside the human rights activist Nadia Vera\u2014both of whom fled the state weeks before, alleging Duarte wanted them dead.\n\nDespite the relief many journalists felt when Duarte stepped down, safety conditions continue in a downward spiral. As an unknown number of bodies\u2014more than 300 skulls, and thousands of bone fragments\u2014were discovered in mass graves unearthed in Veracruz in the span of one week this past March, journalist Ricardo Monlui was brutally murdered in the state. The following week, another reporter was gunned down in Veracruz, but managed to survive despite life-threatening injures.\n\nLast year, as Mexico faced its deadliest year for journalists since the gruesome drug war was launched in 2006, Veracruz claimed the title of \u201cdeadliest state.\u201d\n\nUnder Duarte, Veracruz became the most dangerous state to practice journalism in Mexico, and, according to Reporters Without Borders, one of the 10 most dangerous places for journalists in the world.\n\nBut, besides that distinction, Veracruz also, ironically, became the Mexican state with the largest number of news outlets.\n\nThe state government had been spending millions on contracts with local media companies\u2014a common, legal, and unfortunate practice in Mexico. But, since Duarte left Veracruz crippled and impoverished, those contracts have all now been put to an end.\n\nAccording to the journalist Aguirre, many of the local media companies \u201cthat became complacent and reliant on those funds\u201d have been forced to shutter. Others have resorted to mass firings.\n\n\u201cOne of the papers I work for, Imagen de Veracruz, had huge government contracts,\u201d said Israel Hern\u00e1ndez, another Veracruz-based journalist who reports locally and nationally on the state\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cThe policy was strange. You could be critical of the government as an entity, but to mention [Duarte\u2019s] name in the same line as political corruption or diverted resources\u2014absolutely forbidden,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez explained over the phone. \u201cIt was okay to blame it on a subordinate, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral of us, who had our work stalled internally or were asked to remove his name, would just end up taking those articles to national media outlets instead,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all common here. The policy was implicit and explicit. By no means is it a secret.\u201d\n\nHern\u00e1ndez was shot three weeks ago while livestreaming an armed encounter that left two dead and more than 20 others injured. He\u2019s recovering well, and said he kept the bullet as a professional souvenir.\n\n\u201cI expected the authorities to ask me for it at some point. One would assume they would would want it as, I don\u2019t know, evidence. But they never came,\u201d he said\u2014not sounding too surprised.\n\nWhen news of Duarte\u2019s arrest broke on Saturday, Hern\u00e1ndez celebrated alongside his fellow Veracruzanos, on crutches at a taco stand\u2014barely on his second day outside since that bullet was lodged in his pelvic bone.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez like many local journalists, has lost colleagues, received death threats, been followed, and otherwise kept on his toes.\n\nLike Aguirre, he said Duarte\u2019s disappearance was felt hard by the state media, but that the arrest brings some symbolic relief for his colleagues.\n\nBut both agreed, the end of government media contracts in Veracruz is perhaps the one good thing that came from Duarte\u2019s staggering theft. It\u2019s a practice they\u2019d like to see put to an end, nationally.\n\n***\n\nDuarte, with his thumb on the local press and in the good graces of the federal government, was \u201cuntouchable.\u201d\n\nBut now detained in a Guatemalan cell, he is untouchable for entirely different reasons.\n\nPoliticians across Mexico leapt over each other this week in an effort to distance themselves from the slimy governor, who\u2014always smiling\u2014posed for enough political photo-ops during his career to provide cannon fodder for politicians of all stripes in Mexico.\n\nPundits in Mexico are predominantly theorizing that Duarte\u2019s arrest came at an opportune moment for the ruling political party, which is facing contentious elections in several key states come June.\n\nThe PRI risks losing municipal seats throughout Veracruz, as well as the governorship of three other PRI strongholds, including Mexico State\u2014where President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto first came to power as governor.\n\nThe two PRI governors arrested this week join the ranks of more than a dozen other dirty governors in Mexico. In addition to the pair, three former governors are currently serving time behind bars\u2014all members of the ruling PRI.\n\nAt least two other PRI governors are currently under investigation.\n\nAnd, despite the latest arrests of Duarte and Yarrington, two more Mexican governors are still on the run: Cesar Duarte in Chihuahua\u2014no relation to the disgraced Veracruz governor\u2014and Yarrington\u2019s successor in Tamaulipas, Eugenio Hern\u00e1ndez, who is wanted in the U.S. on money laundering charges, but is not being actively sought in Mexico.\n\nThey, too, served under the umbrella of the ruling PRI.\n\nYet, the idea that the governors\u2019 arrests do anything to benefit the ruling party\u2019s chances come state elections this June, and national elections next year, has proliferated this week, however ludicrous at face value.\n\nThe leftist populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, an early favorite in the 2018 presidential elections, is perfectly poised to ride the wave of both anti-Trump and anti-PRI sentiments in Mexico.\n\nAMLO, as the perennial presidential candidate is popularly known, vociferously contested the results of the irregularity-plagued 2006 and 2012 elections, both of which he claimed to have won.\n\nHis very close upset in the two previous elections led, first, to the 2006 appointment of the man known as the engineer of the Mexican drug war, Felipe Calderon\u2014whose wife, Margarita Zavala, will also be running for president in 2018\u2014and then to the subsequent election of current President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\n\nBut this week, AMLO\u2014whom one would expect to have the least political capital invested in the failed PRI governor Duarte\u2014called his arrest a \u201cpolitical maneuver,\u201d claiming that the government \u201cmade the decision to arrest Duarte as a way to throw mud on [the political party he founded] Morena.\u201d\n\nThe current governor of Veracruz, Miguel Angel Yunes, has accused AMLO and his party of taking cash from dirty Duarte.\n\nAnd AMLO, himself, fueled the fire this week by tweeting that Duarte is a \u201cscapegoat,\u201d and calling his arrest \u201ca simulation.\u201d\n\nIn Mexico State, arguably the most important state to be decided this June, the candidate for the National Action Party, or PAN\u2014the party that briefly interrupted the PRI\u2019s continuous 71-year rule over Mexico from 2000 until President Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s 2012 election\u2014accused both the ruling party, and the leftist opposition of taking money from Duarte.\n\nAMLO, in turn, accused the PAN candidate of misusing funds received from President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who \u201cbetrayed\u201d Duarte this week, even after the former governor \u201cgave money to [Pe\u00f1a\u2019s presidential] campaign in 2012.\u201d\n\nAs theories and speculation about Duarte\u2019s arrest dominated the news, accounting for 40 percent of opinion columns produced this week, 32 percent of the analyzed columns concluded that Duarte\u2019s case is the worst case of corruption seen in Mexico that involves multiple political players.\n\nAs Duarte\u2019s extradition hearing promises to stretch on for as long as one year, his trial in Mexico to answer questions about the myriad crimes he is accused of will be severely postponed.\n\nWith Duarte out of the way, and conveniently silenced by the prolonged extradition proceedings, the dust has yet to settle on just who those players are. And what\u2019s left is a cloud of confusion and conspiracy.\n\n\u201cDuarte knows a lot,\u201d said journalist Aguirre. His colleague Israel Hern\u00e1ndez said, \u201cHe knows too much.\u201d\n\nBut what he knows Mexico will not in time for state elections. And it is unlikely his case will be resolved before Election Day, 2018.\n\nWhat happens this June at the state level promises to set the political stage on which the presidential election will be fought.\n\nAnd, as is typical during Mexican campaign seasons, already a political foodfight has broken out before the starting bell. As Duarte\u2019s connections continue to be revealed, and his name is weaponized and flung about like hot fudge, political players are bound to get a little dirty.\n\nAccording to opinion polls released this week, 40 percent of those polled said the ruling PRI will be most negatively impacted by his arrest. But a close 37 percent believed leftist presidential candidate AMLO\u2019s Morena party will likely take the biggest hit.\n\nAs for Duarte, making a slow crawl through a potentially year-long extradition process before he can even begin the next lengthy process in Mexico, 74 percent of those polled believe that Duarte is guilty.\n\nYet nearly just as many\u201463 percent\u2014said it is unlikely he will be punished.", "description": "Javier Duarte was nabbed in Guatemala after allegedly stealing billions from Veracruz, where scores of journalists were murdered under his watch.", "authors": ["Andrea Noel"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492987187/articles/2017/04/22/mexico-s-most-wanted-man-since-el-chapo/170421-noel-cartels-duarte-tease_tgxzhr", "published_at": "2017-04-22"}
