This is after a surge in complaints in the final month before the deadline.\n\nAround GBP600 million of capital that was allocated to buy back shares from the market will now be held in reserve, Lloyds Banking Group said. However, the company said it continues to target a progressive ordinary dividend at the year end.\n\nThe lender said it has revised its guidance downward. It is no longer targeting a yearly capital build of 170 basis points to 200 basis points, and a statutory return on tangible equity of 12% for 2019.\n\nThe banking group joins a number of other financial services companies that have had to book unexpected charges relating to missold PPI-claims, including Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN) and CYBG PLC (CYBG.LN).\n\nWrite to Carlo Martuscelli at carlo.martuscelli@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 09, 2019 02:37 ET (06:37 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
