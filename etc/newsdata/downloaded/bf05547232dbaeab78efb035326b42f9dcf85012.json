(Picture: Fashion Nova)\n\nOne person joked that you should probably consider shaving if you\u2019re going to wear the leggings.\n\nHowever, loads of other people were desperate to buy them, saying how cute they are.\n\nHonestly, while the style is nice, we can\u2019t help but think the whole day would be spent worrying about the tie coming loose, the uncomfortableness of not wearing underwear, the effort they look to actually even put on, and flashing your genitals.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice idea, but most likely a no from us.\n\nMORE: Woman reveals what it\u2019s like to have two vaginas, two cervixes and two wombs\n\nMORE: Attention, KFC fans: The hot wings bucket deal is back\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Fashion Nova is selling some odd leggings with an open crotch - and it makes you look like you've forgotten to do up your zipper.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91172879_1571761731.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
