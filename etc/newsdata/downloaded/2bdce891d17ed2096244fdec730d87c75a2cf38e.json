Do you?\u201d quipped the third seed, after a reporter asked if he expected to win another Grand Slam title at his age.\n\n\u201cWe never know. I hope so, of course. I think still it\u2019s been a positive season. Disappointing now, but I\u2019ll get back up, I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nHe batted down suggestions that his Wimbledon performance this year played a role in his surprise U.S. Open upset.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think of it. If you move on, it\u2019s a thing of the past. I do remember playing good semis there, so it wasn\u2019t bad. If I think of that, I\u2019m, like, really happy,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Federer, nothing is out of the question \u2014 and not without precedent: The oldest man to win the U.S. Open title was Bill Larned, who was 38 years, 8 months and 3 days old when he triumphed.\n\nOf course, that was in 1911.\n\nAnd past precedent is likely little comfort for Federer, who laid out for reporters an aggressive schedule of future competition.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cLaver Cup, Shanghai, Basel, maybe Paris, London. That\u2019s the schedule for now. I don\u2019t know if the team have other ideas or not,\u201d said Federer. \u201cI\u2019m happy to get a bit of a break now, go back to practice, reassess and attack from there.\u201d\n\nIn four months, he\u2019ll renew his effort to add to his Grand Slam coffers at the Australian Open, where he collected his last title in 2018.\n\n\u201c(I have) got to take the losses. They\u2019re part of the game,\u201d said Federer. \u201cLooking forward to family time and all that stuff, so... Life\u2019s all right.\u201d", "description": "Fresh from a heart-breaking loss at the All-England Tennis Club, the abrupt end to Roger Federer's U.S. Open on Tuesday raised questions whether the 38-year-old can deliver on a record-extending 21st Grand Slam title.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426024528&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830EZ"}
