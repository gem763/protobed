It started when Donald Trump was able to falsely equate Hillary\u2019s emails with Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood tape. One hour after the tape dropped, around 5 p.m. that Oct. 7, Julian Assange started dumping emails that Russian intelligence services had hacked from Clinton\u2019s campaign onto WikiLeaks for the world to see. The idea was simple: distract, obfuscate, and confuse.\n\nAnd it worked. It worked very, very well. It was the cornerstone of an empire of conspiracies and lies, the birth of a cottage industry of far-right hucksters who put the \u201ccon\u201d in conspiracy.\n\n\u201cBut her emails\u201d became such a common refrain it rose to the highest level of internet content: the meme. Sure, Trump had bragged about sexually assaulting women, but have you seen John Podesta\u2019s risotto recipe?", "description": "The Trump M.O. is to make the other person look as big a sleazeball as Trump. Which raises the question: What will be the \u201cbut her emails\u201d of 2020?", "authors": ["Molly Jong-Fast"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2700,w_4800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572043488/191023-Jong-trump-white-house_cxw5k8", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
