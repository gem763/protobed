The younger Biden had served as a director of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThe two men were each charged by federal prosecutors in New York with two counts of conspiracy, one count of false statements and one of falsification of business records. U.S. law prohibits foreign donations in American elections.\n\nParnas and Fruman were trying to buy political influence to help set up recreational marijuana businesses, prosecutors said. They also said Parnas played a role in a successful effort to have Trump remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\n\"Protecting the integrity of our elections, and protecting our elections from unlawful foreign influence, are core functions of our campaign finance laws,\" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman told reporters in New York. \"And as this office has made clear, we will not hesitate to investigate and prosecute those who engage in criminal conduct that draws into question the integrity of our political process\"\n\nBerman served on Trump's transition team after Trump was elected president to prepare for taking office in January 2017.\n\nThe indictment said Parnas and Fruman falsely claimed the company, called Global Energy Producers or GEP, which was making the political donations, was \"a real business enterprise\" and that \"its major purpose is energy trading, not political activity.\" In fact, the company had no real business, the indictment added.\n\nThe two were arrested at Dulles airport in Virginia on Wednesday night, prosecutors said.\n\nJohn Dowd, the lawyer for Parnas and Fruman, declined to comment on the charges. Dowd previously represented Trump in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that detailed Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to boost Trump's candidacy.\n\nParnas and Fruman made their initial court appearance in Alexandria, Virginia, with another court date set for next Thursday. They were being represented in the court appearance by lawyers for Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is serving prison time after being convicted last year in Mueller's investigation.\n\nFederal Magistrate Judge Michael Nachmanoff imposed a lengthy, strict set of conditions that Parnas and Fruman must meet to be released, including each posting $1 million bond and being placed on GPS monitoring in home detention. The prosecution called the men a flight risk.\n\nAsked for a response, Giuliani told Reuters he had \"no involvement\" in the flow of money at the heart of the Parnas and Fruman indictment.", "description": "WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Two foreign-born Florida businessmen who have helped President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani investigate political rival Joe Biden were arrested in a scheme to illegally funnel money to a pro-Trump election committee and other U.S. political", "authors": ["Aram Roston", "Brendan Pierson", "Karen Freifeld"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
