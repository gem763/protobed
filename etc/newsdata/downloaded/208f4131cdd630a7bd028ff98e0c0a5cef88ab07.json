Rasmussen, the referee, heads out of town to feed his pack of sled dogs.

The team has not been Greenland champion since 2007. This is its chance.\n\nFrederiksen and his team of volunteers have gone all out for the occasion: Ennio Morricone\u2019s theme from \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d blares from the public-address system, as do songs from the Greenlandic band Chilly Friday. Most of the other teams in the competition have come to watch, taking up positions on the cliff in club-branded gear.\n\nThe game, one that might have been a forfeit, proves one-sided: N-48 runs rampant, winning, 4-0, and denying the vaunted B-67 a place in the final.\n\nSlowly, the crowd begins to disperse, clambering down the cliff, drifting back to town, to normal life. N-48\u2019s players cram into cars and head to the beach, to dip their legs in the cold water, to try to recover. For them, and for all the teams, there was one more night to spend on mattresses in makeshift lodgings. One more game to play.\n\nN-48 beats G-44 in the final. IT-79 rallies to claim third, holding off Greenland\u2019s Real Madrid. Brummerstedt\u2019s G.S.S. does finish last. Everyone will soon be on their way home, at sea again, ready for their lives to start again.\n\nIt had been only seven days since the tournament began, but it feels far longer. A season that lasts just a week is still a season; it still contains months.\n\nBefore the final day, on Saturday night, Frederiksen and one of his volunteers went out to sea.
