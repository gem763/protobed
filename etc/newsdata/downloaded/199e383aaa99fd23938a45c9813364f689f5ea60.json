Underwood says that he and state Attorney General Mark Herring don't believe the law applies to the city's 80-foot (24-meter) Confederate monument of a solider nicknamed \"Johnny Reb.\"\n\nThe 1904 law initially applied to counties and was expanded in 1997. However, the city's bronze monument was erected in 1907. In 2017, Herring issued an opinion that said the law didn't apply retroactively to statues erected before the law's expansion.\n\nIt's unclear when the statue will be moved.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
