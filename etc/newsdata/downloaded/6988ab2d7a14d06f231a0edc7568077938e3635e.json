In 2000, Smith, then 28, was disciplined for having sex four times with 50-year-old prison guard Houston Cagle. (He pleaded guilty and spent 3 months in jail.)\n\nThe following year, a prison captain, Alfred Rowe, also pleaded guilty to having sex with Smith and was sentenced to five years probation.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that changes how some guards deal with her,\u201d the prison source tells PEOPLE exclusively. \u201cThe guards never allow her to be alone with one of them; she is always with two or more guards, and extra prisoners are often transported with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one trusts her to be alone with a guard,\u201d the source continues. \u201cShe spends most of her time in her cell or working her job, but when she\u2019s being transported, there are always two guards with her, preferably a male and a female.\u201d\n\nView photos\n\nSmith, now 48, has spent more than half of her life in prison for the drowning murder of her two sons. The case, which became international news and was featured on the cover of PEOPLE, made Smith a household name in the mid-1990s.\n\nOn October 25, 1994, she told police that she had been carjacked by a black man who had taken off with her two young sons still in her car. For 9 days, she made tearful pleas for their safe return. But it was all a lie \u2014 and she finally admitted that there was no carjacker. She had let her car roll into a lake with Michael, 3, and Alex, 14 months, still strapped into their car seats.\n\nHer motive: She was secretly dating a man who didn\u2019t want children. Smith was convicted of two counts of murder and is serving a life sentence.\n\nView photos Susan Smith in August, 2017 | South Carolina Department of Corrections More\n\nRecords obtained by PEOPLE show that her incarceration has been marred with disciplinary infractions for self-mutilation and drug use.\n\nAt least six times in the past two years, Smith has had severe enough medical issues that she has been transferred to another facility for outpatient treatment. The nature of her treatment has not been made public.\n\nIn the past nine years, Smith has been disciplined at least five times for various infractions, including self-mutilation and the use and possession of narcotics or marijuana.
