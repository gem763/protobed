In doing so, they run the danger of ignoring some of the lessons of history.\n\nBefore the global financial crisis a decade ago, investors flooded into mortgage trusts and other unlisted funds to capture the attractive yields. They were offered immediate redemptions but, when the crisis hit, discovered their investments were illiquid.\n\nThe message is to maintain a balanced portfolio and not fall into the trap of believing history cannot repeat itself.\n\nLearning from history\n\nAustralia\u2019s banks escaped the worst of the global crisis and did not have to be rescued by the government as happened in the United Kingdom and the United States. But that does not mean investors should treat the equity style securities issued by banks as if they amounted to risk-free fixed interest.\n\nThe hybrid securities issued by banks \u2013 convertibles, preference shares and capital notes \u2013 are more akin to equity than fixed interest. They are issued as a back-up that can be called upon in times of trouble. They can suffer severe capital losses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year bank hybrids have been heavily bid to the point where they are regarded as expensive. But the yields seem attractive at about 2.8 per cent compared with bank savings rates of 1.5 per cent.\n\nIt would seem National Australia Bank offers the most competitive deposit rate through its online bank, UBank. It offers a 2.41 per cent rate deposit rate, which is only available with the combination of a USaver account and Ultra transaction account.\n\nThe specialist fixed income managers had some worrying anecdotes. They said investors were rushing into high-risk peer-to-peer lending products to get yields of 7 per cent. This raises questions about the risk-reward trade-off.\n\nAlso, some fixed-income funds were piling leverage on leverage to goose up yields, the managers said.\n\nMany investors will inevitably shift from fixed interest into equities to secure the yields they need to preserve their household income. The logical move will be into companies exposed to US dollar earnings given the fall in the Australian dollar to the lowest level since 2004.\n\nAustralia has had one of the best performing stock markets in the world this year. Rate cuts will help this trend.\n\nIf you believe the economy is travelling better than the RBA thinks, then the shift into shares will prove to be a smart option. If you believe the economy is heading downwards, then government bonds will prove a good option.", "description": "RBA governor Philip Lowe admits the world's central banks are fighting against a global appetite to save, which is far stronger than the appetite to invest.
