REUTERS/Jefferson Siegel/File Photo\n\nGooding is expected to appear in court Thursday and plead not guilty to the charges, according to his lawyer, Mark Heller.\n\nThe charges are not yet public, and a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance declined to provide details. Heller said the charges stemming from the third accuser were \u201csimilar\u201d to those involving the other two women, and that all are misdemeanors.\n\n\u201cEach accuser is totally fraudulent,\u201d Heller said, adding that there was video of all three alleged incidents exonerating his client.\n\nGooding, 51, won a best supporting actor Oscar in 1997 for the film \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d and is known for roles in movies including \u201cA Few Good Men\u201d and \u201cThe Butler\u201d and in the television miniseries \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson.\u201d\n\nHe was previously charged with one count of forcible touching and one count of sexual abuse in connection with each of the first two accusers. He pleaded not guilty on Oct. 15.\n\nProsecutors said at the time that they hoped to establish a pattern of behavior at Gooding\u2019s trial using testimony from 12 additional women who have said they were subjected to unwanted touching and advances by the actor in bars and clubs.\n\nIt was not clear whether the accuser behind the new charges is one of the 12.\n\nGooding, who is divorced, is one of dozens of men in politics, entertainment, sports and the business world who have been accused of sexual misconduct since allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein triggered the #MeToo movement.\n\nWeinstein is scheduled to stand trial in New York in January on charges of rape and assault involving two women. He has denied any non-consensual sex.", "description": "Actor Cuba Gooding Jr, already facing a criminal case over accusations he touched a woman's breasts in a bar and pinched another's buttocks in a nightclub, has been charged in connection with a third woman, his lawyer said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446699119&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T20Q", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
