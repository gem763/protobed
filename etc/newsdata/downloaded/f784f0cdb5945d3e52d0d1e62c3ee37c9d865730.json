Hancock said that during the ride, Kim made unwanted sexual advances and attacked him when he threatened to pull over -- the crux of a self-defense defense.\n\nWhen Hancock arrived at Kim\u2019s destination two miles away, surveillance video showed Kim-- who had a blood alcohol content level of .308 when the autopsy was performed -- did not get out of the car.\n\nUber records showed that by the time Hancock shot Kim, the car had traveled about 70 miles from the spot Kim was picked up.\n\nARKANSAS WOMAN CLAIMS BROTHER FED HER 'METH SANDWICH'\n\nDefense lawyers said Hancock demanded that Kim enter another address into the Uber app. They said Kim touched Hancock more than once on the leg and became aggressive. Kim punched the driver in the face and reached for the steering wheel and ignition. Prosecutors said Hancock stopped the car, went to the front passenger side where Kim was sitting, and fired 10 bullets from his semi-automatic handgun. At least five struck Kim.\n\nA witness called 911 and Hancock\u2019s defense said Hancock got on the phone, told dispatchers he had been attacked and asked first responders to hurry so Kim might live, according to KMGH-TV.\n\nEL PASO WALMART MASSACRE SUSPECT PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO CAPITAL MURDER CHARGES\n\nDefense lawyer Johnna Stuart said Hancock tried to jump out of his still-rolling car, but Kim attempted to pull him back by his dreadlocks, prompting Hancock to grab the gun.\n\nProsecutors said it was possible Kim did not get out at his destination because he was passed out and Hancock drove around to increase the fare. They acknowledged that Kim likely provoked a fight in the car, but said he could have woken up startled and upset about being driven around in the car. Hancock did have an injury above his eyebrow after the killing, but prosecutors said it was not serious enough for him to have reasonably feared for his life.\n\nUber records showed no previous altercations for either man.\n\nDeputy District Attorney Brenna Zortman said she believed Hancock was sorry for shooting Kim but said the killing was deliberate. \u201cRegret does not negate intent,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs the not-guilty verdict was read, Hancock\u2019s family hugged, sobbed and cheered. The attorney who represents Kim's kin said they plan to file a wrongful-death lawsuit against Uber.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The Uber driver who fatally shot a drunken, unruly passenger was found not guilty of murder by a Colorado jury Thursday.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/uber.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
