The issue only affects Windows 10 1903.\n\n\"Microsoft has received reports that some users are having issues related to the Start menu and Windows Desktop Search,\" Microsoft notes.\n\nThe company is \"presently investigating and will provide an update when more information is available\".\n\nWindows 10 1903 users on Reddit have complained that after installing the Patch Tuesday update, the Start Menu \"results in a blank window again\".\n\nReddit users appear to be losing patience with Microsoft's ongoing Windows 10 fumbles.\n\n\"Typical Microsoft, fixes the CPU usage by completely breaking search so it can't even be used,\" wrote another Windows 10 user.\n\nMicrosoft is also drawing criticism on the Windows 10 Feedback Hub, where a user is recommending others against installing the security update, as per MSPoweruser.\n\n\"KB4515384 should address an issue that causes high CPU usage from SearchUI.exe for a small number of users. But this update again introduces the same problem as the previous update. Part of the problem is a high CPU usage (~30%) and a totally broken search function. Currently, I see no other option than to blacklist this update also to prevent update to reinstall it again and again.\"\n\nWhich brings users of Windows 10 1903 \u2013 the latest version of Windows 10 \u2013 back to the same predicament they were in a month ago. Should they install a security update with fixes for 17 critical flaws or wait for the next update that may or may not address bugs that break key Windows 10 features?\n\nAt least one Windows watcher, Woody Leonhard, was rightly skeptical on Tuesday when noting that KB4515384 included an \"apparent fix for the SearchUI.exe\" bug.\n\nMore on Microsoft's Windows 10 updates", "description": "Microsoft is looking into new Windows Desktop Search problems, caused by its latest Windows 10 1903 patch.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/08/20/9355437c-dfa6-4901-895a-8913921d1ea7/thumbnail/770x578/a3baf3c0730c876c6e369f9c9e5e6670/social-media-fatigue-blocked-istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
