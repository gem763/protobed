They \u2014 like many other young Canadians \u2014 were railing against what they consider deficiencies in Trudeau\u2019s environmental policy.\n\nThe nationalization of an oil pipeline in 2018 is one of the major criticisms leveled against Trudeau, who is seeking re-election in Canada\u2019s election on Monday.\n\nThe Liberal government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline, which links Alberta to British Columbia, from the American energy giant Kinder Morgan for Can$4.5 billion ($2.7 billion, 2.4 billion euros).\n\nThe goal was to speed up the export of oil from Alberta to new foreign markets. In exchange, the Canadian government promised to invest the profits in green technology.\n\nMany Canadian environmentalists viewed Trudeau\u2019s move as a betrayal. The deal may cost him crucial votes on Monday, with the prime minister currently polling neck and neck with Conservative Andrew Scheer.\n\nFor activists, Trudeau, who was a symbol of hope when he took office in 2015, is no longer a change agent but the man who didn\u2019t do enough for the environment.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Huge disappointment\u2019 \u2013\n\nOn university campuses, protesting for the environment \u2014 one of the key issues in the election \u2014 is all the rage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an uptick in membership in all sorts of environmental groups at McGill\u201d in recent weeks, said Audrey Nelles from Divest McGill, a student group advocating for the prestigious Montreal university to withdraw funds it has invested in fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cI think that after the Harper years, there was a lot of hope,\u201d said Annabelle Couture-Guay, also of Divest McGill, referring to Trudeau\u2019s Conservative predecessor Stephen Harper.\n\nBut \u201cbuying the Trans Mountain pipeline, that was a huge disappointment. It made a lot of people cynical,\u201d she said.\n\nThe pipeline issue has also provided Trudeau\u2019s rivals with plenty of ammunition.\n\nThe Liberals \u201ctried to please everyone, and that drew criticism from the right for not having gone far enough in economic development, and from the left for having bought the pipeline,\u201d said Daniel Beland, a political specialist at McGill.\n\nAt the end of September, the New Democratic Party (NDP) \u2014 whose leader Jagmeet Singh has risen in the polls and appeals to the Liberal left wing \u2014 issued a five-word statement responding to Trudeau\u2019s climate plan: \u201cYou. Bought. A. Pipeline.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Future \u2013\n\nLiberals have pledged net zero carbon emissions by 2050, two billion trees planted and the promotion of clean technology.\n\nThere have also been a few advances, such as a federal carbon tax plan, the protection of 14 percent of marine and coastal areas, and the publication of major scientific reports on climate change in Canada.\n\nYoung voters demanding stronger climate policy are facing a dilemma because of Canada\u2019s first-past-the-post system: voting for smaller parties can split the vote between the left and the center, opening the door for the Conservatives.\n\nBut protesters at \u201cFridays for Future,\u201d a movement started by teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, promise to continue applying pressure \u2014 whether or not they are of voting age.\n\n\u201cSince we\u2019re young people who can\u2019t vote, we want to influence people who can,\u201d explained Marlene Gaudreau, 17, co-organizer of a Friday protest outside Trudeau\u2019s campaign office.\n\n\u201cWe would like to have a future too,\u201d she said.", "description": "Montreal (AFP) \u2013 Bearing posters of Justin Trudeau\u2019s face, written over with green crosses and the word \u201cpipeline,\u201d students", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/25fef3_students-protest-stronger-climate-policy-justin-trudeau-campaign-headquarters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
