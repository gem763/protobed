The system effectively allows operators to compete on price in real time.\n\nIn May, the SEC said securities exchange operators must do a better job of describing and justifying their fees when they make a filing, or else the filing will be suspended for review.\n\nTuesday's proposal, which is subject to public consultation before adoption, comes after a years-long dispute over what many brokers and investors see as soaring costs for services essential for trading, but which are also major revenue drivers for most exchange operators.\n\nExchanges lodge hundreds of fee-related filings with the SEC each year. Under current rules - known as the National Market System plan, or Regulation NMS - fee changes become effective immediately to ensure retail investors get the best price possible. NMS also prevents trades being executed at prices inferior to bid and offer prices displayed at other trading venues.\n\nUnder Tuesday's proposal, the delay before implementing changes could make it tougher for exchange operators to compete quickly on price, potentially limiting future revenue growth.\n\n\"The fees charged by NMS plans affect a wide variety of investors and market participants,\" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement. \"This rulemaking will help ensure that NMS plan fee changes benefit from review and comment by investors and market participants before those fees can be charged.\"", "description": "U.S. SEC proposes exchanges seek public consultation on data fee changes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9103E_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
