Business Insider / Lamont Mark Smith\n\nHave you ever been on a foreign cab ride where you feel like your driver is ripping you off?\n\nWell, you might not have to worry about that if you could hail a ride without having to worry about the language barrier.\n\nA partnership between ride-hailing service Grab and Booking.com will allow travellers to book local rides without worrying about language barriers or about getting ripped off.\n\nAnnounced on Tuesday (Oct 29) morning, Booking.com app users can now book Grab rides in Singapore without having to create a new account or downloading the Grab app.\n\nThe service will be rolled out in Indonesia and Thailand by the end of the year, and will be made available in Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Phillippines by early 2020.\n\nAvailable only on iOS, the partnership will provide users with \u201cthe tools they need to travel like a local,\u201d the companies said.\n\nUsers can choose their preferred currency and language on the service, and messages sent via the Grab\u2019s instant messaging (IM) feature will be auto-translated into any of the 42 local languages that Booking.com operates in.\n\nFor example, Danish-speaking travellers in Singapore will be able to send messages to Grab drivers in their native language, as their messages will be auto-translated as long as they are using the Booking.com app.\n\nThe service is located under the \u201cmore\u201d section of the Booking.com app, and users will be able to change their preferred language and currency in the \u201csettings\u201d menu. Business Insider / Lamont Mark Smith\n\nSouth-east Asia, \u201cwith its love of mobile technology, is the obvious arena in which to take on the challenge of ride-hailing,\u201d the companies said. According to ABI Research, as much 70 per cent of the world\u2019s ride-hailing activity takes place in Asia as a whole.\n\nAdditionally, tourist arrivals to Asean are projected to reach 155.4 million by 2022, according to GlobalData.\n\nSean Keng, Grab\u2019s regional head of business development, told reporters on Tuesday morning that the partnership is a \u201cnatural fit\u201d for the company to cater towards international travellers, especially since \u201cground transport is really fragmented in South-east Asia\u201d\n\nThis is not the only time the online travel site will be partnering with Asian transport providers.\n\nDavid Adamczyk, Booking.com transport division\u2019s director of strategy, said that the site is looking to collaborate with China\u2019s Didi Chuxing ride-hailing service as well, after the full rollout of the Grab service.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - The service will be available in 42 languages and currencies, and will have an auto-translate messaging platform as well..
