This growing consumer base encouraged more manufacturers to enter the industry and create unique products for individual drivers and families. In turn, the automotive marketplace became more innovative, competitive and profitable.\n\nDan Albert\u2019s \u201cAre We There Yet?: The American Automobile Past, Present, and Driverless\u201d is an enjoyable, well-written examination of America\u2019s love affair with the automobile. He gracefully mixes serious stories with humorous anecdotes and examines what the future holds in a hands-free, driverless environment.\n\nMr. Albert has gained a reputation as a leading automotive historian in his contributions for the literary magazine n+1. In his view, \u201ca deep understanding of American automotive history and the American car culture is critical to cutting through the self-serving explanations for the driverless car and getting to the truth.\u201d Driverless vehicles are still being developed, and haven\u2019t established a comfort zone with most people. At the same time, \u201cthe end of driving in America will have profound consequences for how we organize our lives.\u201d\n\nThe automobile\u2019s history is diverse. Early prototypes include Flemish missionary Ferdinand Verbiest\u2019s \u201cJesuit Rat Car\u201d in 1672 (although there\u2019s no proof it ever existed) and France\u2019s Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot\u2019s cannon hauler in 1769. The first Americans to own cars were Europeans \u201cby another name,\u201d including the Rothschild and Astor families.\n\nIn fact, \u201cAmerica First types may be disappointed to learn that it was France that had the first car culture.\u201d Mon dieu!\n\nIt didn\u2019t take took long for Americans to pass on their fascination with bicycles and move to cars. This first wave included the \u201clargely forgotten\u201d William Morrison, who rode his electric vehicle in Chicago in 1891, Charles and Frank Duryea\u2019s 1893 internal combustion automobile and the Stanley brothers\u2019s 1897 steam automobile.\n\nIt was Ford\u2019s automobiles that truly broke the American mold. While some viewed him as a \u201cbenevolent authoritarian \u2026 who bestowed mobility on the common man,\u201d others recognized his affordable Model T as \u201cnot simply the product of American capitalism but of a particular vision of our motorized future.\u201d This visionary built his first car in 1896, established his motor company in 1903, paid his employees high wages to encourage productivity and introduced an assembly line.\n\nFord was a flawed individual. Mr. Albert suggests he had a \u201cmonomaniacal, dictatorial, and simpleminded approach to running a car company.\u201d He published the anti-Semitic tract \u201cThe International Jew\u201d in the early 1920s, which was sent to Ford dealers and placed in Model T backseats. Most importantly, he didn\u2019t adapt to customers\u2019 changing tastes, which destroyed his greatest creation.\n\nThis opened the door to competitors like General Motors, founded by William C. Durant in 1908. His management style was described in the book as \u201cseat-of-the-pants.\u201d A \u201csnake oil and carriage salesman\u201d who spent money like water, he used GM as a holding company and purchased smaller manufacturers like Oldsmobile, Cadillac and Oakland (later Pontiac). He even tried to buy Ford, but lacked dollars and cents. As Mr. Albert amusingly writes, \u201chad someone told him about credit default swaps he might have fainted from joy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre We There Yet?\u201d also looks at developments that did affect, or could have affected, the automobile.\n\n\u201cThe Interstates are not the product of Republican free-market ideology,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut of its opposite: statist central planning by Washington.\u201d There\u2019s an intriguing chapter on flying cars, which was the stuff of dreams as \u201creal-life aerial drama\u201d captured American hearts and minds. Ralph Nader became a \u201ccrusader for auto safety\u201d long before he ran for the White House. Foreign competition, including the Volkswagen Bug, was originally America\u2019s mortal enemy because to drive it \u201cwas to reject the car that capitalism built in favor of the socialist machine, the people\u2019s car.\u201d\n\nIn the rich history of American automobiles, there\u2019s a sense of sadness that it will gradually come to an end. \u201cWhen we embrace driverless cars,\u201d Mr. Albert writes, \u201cwe will surrender our American automobile as an adventure machine, as a tool of self-expression, and the wellspring of our wealth and our defense.\u201d He\u2019s probably right. At least we\u2019ll still have fond memories of riding those winding roads as independent, car-loving creatures.\n\n\u2022 Michael Taube is a frequent contributor to The Washington Times.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nARE WE THERE YET?: THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE PAST, PRESENT, AND DRIVERLESS\n\nBy Dan Albert\n\nW.W.
