The scientists also collected urine, vaginal fluid and blood samples.\n\nAccording to the findings, 35 per cent of the women were eligible to be vaginal fluid transplant donors. The hope is that scientists will be able to eventually identify \u201csuper donors\u201d, who have favourable lactobacillus-dominated microbiota, which tends to be higher in protective lactic acid content and lower pH.\n\nTo become a donor, researchers suggest abstaining from sex for at least 30 days would be necessary, before giving a sample. The donor would also be screened for infections including HIV.\n\nAccording to study co-author and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, Dr Laura Ensign: \u201cOnce a safe donor has been identified using this protocol, she could donate on multiple appropriately screened occasions. The idea of a 'super-donor' with no identified past or current infections and with favourable Lactobacillus-dominated microbiota is one that should be explored.\"\n\nThe technique has already received regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n\"If we can get funding, we could start right away,\" said Dr Ensign.", "description": "Women who suffer from a common vaginal infection that makes them more vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections may soon be treated with vaginal fluid transplants.\u00a0 Scientists in the US are currently researching the technique, which would involve taking vaginal bacteria from a healthy donor and transferring it to the patient, in treating bacterial vaginosis (BV).", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/17/istock-874066468.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
