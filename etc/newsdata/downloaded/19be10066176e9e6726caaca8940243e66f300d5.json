We have a ton of ideas, we want to have a lot more engineers and definitely we are gonna need a lot more capital in order to do that,\u201d he said, adding that the company might \u201cbe able to announce something before the end of the year.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, their strategy is to get more people interested in some of the free or cheaper lower-tier products.\n\n\u201cIf we can get them interested in the system and happy with our user interface and general experience, then they\u2019ll probably expand and want to start using other products within the suite. If we put out a lot of products, we get a lot of interest. As Bitcoin continues to expand we just want to ride that wave,\u201d the CTO explained.\n\nAlso, he stressed that today many crypto users may not be willing to invest in their asset security as \u201cthey don\u2019t have much to lose.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin continues to grow, they will have more to lose, it\u2019ll be riskier and they\u2019ll be willing to basically pay more to insure it,\u201d Lopp said.\n\nTheir core product is the Casa Keymaster, or the multisignature vault, that might cost up to USD 420 per month, depending on the security level.\n\n\u201cWe have a decent number of users that are top tier, who pay thousands of dollars a year because they are securing potentially millions of dollars worth of value,\u201d the CTO said, adding that their user base has increased as they\u2019ve introduced some cheaper tiers, including a free one.\n\n______\n\nWatch the whole interview with Jameson Lopp below:", "description": "Casa, the U.S.-based private key security specialist, also known for its plug-and-play Bitcoin and Lightning node, is looking to raise more capital to finance their business growth as the company aims to ride the Bitcoin adoption wave, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Jameson Lopp told Cryptonews.com.", "authors": ["Eimantas \u017demaitis", "Linas Kmieliauskas"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d8/d8a584ae89.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
