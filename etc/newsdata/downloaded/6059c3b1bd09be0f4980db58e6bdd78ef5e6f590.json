They\u2019ll be dropping in every now and again, sharing their expertise on the basics you don\u2019t have time to research and the weird and wonderful things you don\u2019t yet know you need.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard, \u201990s-style combat books are back (and if you are curious as to why, read here). And these particular Michael by Michael Kors combat boots, which we wrote about a few weeks ago, and which were hand-plucked by our colleagues in the Cut\u2019s fashion department as being wonderful, are currently 25 percent off as part of a wider 25 percent off Michael Kors sale.\n\nWe like that the toe is a little pointy (so it\u2019s slightly more elegant than your classic combat boot), that they\u2019re patent leather (so they\u2019re kind of fancy), and that the heel is almost wedgelike (so they\u2019re likely quite comfortable).\n\nThere\u2019s also a cheetah-print calf-hair version on sale. As well as a more traditional combat boot with a higher, chunkier heel.\n\nMichael by Michael Kors Haskell Combat Boots $149 (was $199, now 25% off) $149 at Macy's Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
