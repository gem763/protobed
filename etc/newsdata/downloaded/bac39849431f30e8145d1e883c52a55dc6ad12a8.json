I am feeling good.\n\n\u201cAfter Roger Bannister it took another 65 years to make history,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019ve gone under two hours to inspire other people and show the world nobody is limited.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBack in Kenya thousands poured on to the streets of the capital Nairobi as Kipchoge made history.\n\nOn streets usually clogged with traffic, cars stopped so drivers could watch the run on big screens.\n\nKipchoge\u2019s time was not recognised as a world record because the event was not classed as an official race.\n\nThe Kenyan\u2019s of 2:01:39 run in Berlin last year still holds that distinction.\n\nBut many now believe he could one day get under two hours in a race that qualifies for world record status.\n\nAnd Kipchoge reckons others will undoubtedly crack the time now that he is shown it can be done.\n\nAlthough running is a solo pursuit, this was much a team effort with British influence to the fore.\n\nIt was organised and funded by British chemical company Ineos, run by Jim Ratcliffe, and dubbed the Ineos 1.59 challenge.\n\nA group of 41 world-class athletes were choreographed into rotating teams of seven pacemakers to ensure Kipchoge kept the right speed.\n\nThey included American Olympic 1500metre champion Matthew Centrowitz, and Paul Chelimo, who took silver in the 5000m at the Rio Games in 2016.\n\nGuided by green laser beams fired from an electric Audi on to the ground to precisely control their pace, they were divided into teams of seven.\n\nFive runners formed an arrowhead in front of Kipchoge to reduce wind resistance while two ran behind him.\n\nIt is a tactic common in cycling and much of the planning was done by Brit Dave Brailsford, who runs the Tour de France winning outfit, Team Ineos.\n\nEach group ran in stints of just under three miles as Kipchoge completed 4.4 laps of the 5.97-mile course, in Prater Hauptallee park in the centre of Vienna.\n\nThe long straight with loops at the end, has slightly raised banks and was partially resurfaced to help Kipchoge keep pace and avoid injury.\n\nThe venue, just 540ft above sea level, and time of year were carefully chosen to offer the best running conditions \u2013 cool and still.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nTo save time, drinks were provided by a bicycle rider with Kipchoge supping a super-rich Swedish energy drink called Maurten, rather than his usual sugary tea.\n\nAs the pacemakers peeled away on the final straight, he accelerated, smiling and pointing at the crowd who gave him a rousing reception.\n\nHe punched his chest twice and pointed as he crossed the line and ran into the arms of his jubilant wife Grace Sugut, his childhood sweetheart.\n\nBut the man nicknamed \u201cthe philosopher\u201d by friends because of his love of reading, showed no such emotion during the race.\n\n\u201cI was really calm and trying to go with the pace, not to be crazy or slow,\u201d Kipchoge said.\n\nAsked about the reaction in Kenya, he went on: \u201cEveryone can step out of their door and think positively.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can make this world a beautiful world and a peaceful world.\n\n\u201cMy wife and children, I am happy for them to come and witness history.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nIt was Kipchoge\u2019s second attempt to break the barrier, having missed out by 26 seconds in Monza, Italy, in 2017.\n\nAnd he is likely to be handsomely rewarded for cracking it this time.\n\nWhen he returns to home to the city of Eldoret, in the Rift Valley, Kipchoge may become a Kenyan shilling billionaire \u2013 equivalent to \u00a37million.\n\nKenya\u2019s Brigid Kosgei eclipsed the 16-year-old women\u2019s marathon world record held by Britain\u2019s Paula Radcliffe at the Chicago Marathon yesterday. The 25-year-old recorded a time of 2:14:04, easily inside Radcliffe\u2019s mark of 2:15:25 which was set in the 2003 London Marathon.\n\nOnly 22 athletes in the men\u2019s race ran faster than Kosgei, whose time would have been a men\u2019s world record in 1964.\n\nBannister, Beamon, Ali... top sport milestones\n\n(Image: PA Archive/Press Association Images)\n\nEliud Kipchoge\u2019s remarkable time has earned himself a place in the history books alongside the world\u2019s sporting greats.\n\nHe is following in the footsteps of the finest ever athletes, including Roger Bannister who, in 1954, ran the first sub-four-minute mile.\n\nIn the 1968 Olympics American Bob Beamon leaped over 29ft, a long jump record that stood until for 23 years, until 1991. While Cuban high jumper Javier Sotomayor\u2019s 8ft-plus 1993 world record still stands.\n\nTen years later Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Akhtar bowled the first 100mph ball, faced by Nick Knight in the 2003 World Cup.\n\nA more sedate but no less impressive achievement came from Tiger Woods in 2001 when he won golf\u2019s grand slam by holding all 4 majors simultaneously.\n\nIn F1 Finn Keke Rosberg made history in 1985 by completing a grand prix lap at an average of more than 160mph.\n\nMuhammad Ali began earning his nickname The Greatest at an early age. He was just 22 when he beat Sonny Liston, the youngest boxer to unseat a reigning heavyweight champion.\n\nRomanian Nadia Comaneci was the first gymnast to be awarded a perfect score of 10 at the Olympic Games.\n\nShe got six more 10s en route to winning three golds at the Montreal Games in 1976.\n\nJamaica\u2019s Usain Bolt still holds the 100m world record with a time of 9.58 seconds, set in Berlin in 2009.", "description": "Super-human athlete from Kenya first trained in his mountain village \u2014 and this high-intensity altitude running laid the foundations for huge success", "authors": ["Tom Parry", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa", "Pa Archive Press Association Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572123.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Eliud-Kipchoge-the-marathon-world-record-holder-from-Kenya-attempts-to-run-a-marathon-in-under-two.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
