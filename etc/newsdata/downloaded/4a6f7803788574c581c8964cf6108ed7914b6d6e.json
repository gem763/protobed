This is the fight Nobel Prize-winning economist Esther Duflo wants to address. Duflo was honoured with the coveted award alongside her husband, India-born Abhijit Banerjee and Prof Michael Kremer for their work in alleviating global poverty. Abhijit, 58, and Esther, 46, work as professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 46-year-old economist, a France national, is the second-ever woman to be bestowed by this honour. She is the youngest recipient of Nobel economics honour as well. The first woman to win the Nobel for economics was Elinor Ostrom, who was awarded in the year 2009. She died in 2012.\n\nCongratulations to 2019 Economic Sciences Laureate Esther Duflo!\n\n\n\nDuflo was woken up this morning to news of her Prize in Economic Sciences and sent us this selfie right afterwards.#NobelPrize pic.twitter.com/aH4ndPU4FA \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 14, 2019\n\n\"Showing that it is possible for a woman to succeed and be recognised for success I hope is going to inspire many, many other women to continue working and many other men to give them the respect they deserve, she said, in her Nobel speech, reflecting on the lack of representation for women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to show younger people that economics is relevant to problems that they care about,\" she said. Humbled over her prestigious win, she said that winning the award was completely unexpected as usually \u201ca Noble prize goes to a male economist over the age of 60\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prize money of nine million Swedish krona (\u00a3728,000) will be shared by the three academics.\n\n\n\nWatch her speech here:\n\n", "description": "2019 Economic Sciences Laureate Esther Duflo, born in 1972, is the second woman and the youngest person to be awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/esther-duflo-sm-thub1571118419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
