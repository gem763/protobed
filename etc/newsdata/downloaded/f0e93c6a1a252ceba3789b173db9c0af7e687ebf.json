Leave to rest for 20 minutes before making the pancakes.\n\nHeat a non-stick pancake or small frying pan over a medium heat, then once the pan is hot, brush with oil evenly, then carefully pour in half a ladleful of the batter and immediately spread with the back of the spoon to form pancakes.\n\nBrush oil on top and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side. Check if the pancake is fluffy and cooked on both sides. Repeat to cook the remaining pancakes. Serve with a dollop of coconut milk yoghurt or your choice of chutney.\n\nKachumber salad\n\nThis is one of the most common salads made in the homes and restaurants of Indian families. I think it goes really well with so many dishes because of its fresh flavour and vibrant colours.\n\nTime: 10 minutes\n\nServes 3-4\n\n\u00bd small cucumber, deseeded and chopped into fine batons\n\n1 small red onion, thinly sliced\n\n40g white hard cabbage, shredded\n\n\u00bd green apple, cored and sliced\n\nSeeds of \u00bd pomegranate\n\nJuice of 1 lime\n\n\u00bd tsp salt\n\n1 tsp chopped fresh coriander\n\nAdd all the ingredients to a serving bowl and toss everything together well. Eat immediately.\n\nPosto boras \u2013 poppy seed cakes\n\nPosto boras is a white poppy seed dish that is cooked in Bengali households. Also known as poppy seed cakes, these are small round bites that are mouth-wateringly\u200b delicious. You can serve these as a side dish with a main meal, but I love them as snacks.\n\nTime: 50 minutes\n\nMakes 8-10\n\n100g white poppy seeds\n\n4 green chillies, seeds in, chopped\n\n1 small onion, chopped\n\n1 tsp grated fresh root ginger\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n1 tsp cumin seeds\n\nMustard or rapeseed oil, for shallow-frying\n\nSliced shallots and mint and coriander chutney, to serve\n\nSoak the poppy seeds in cold water for 30 minutes. Drain the poppy seeds, tip them into a blender and whiz to a paste. Add the paste to a bowl with the rest of the ingredients, except the oil.\n\nHeat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. While the oil is heating, make 8-10 golf ball-sized balls from the poppy seed mixture and then flatten them.\n\nOnce the oil is hot, lower the temperature. Cook the boras, in batches, until golden and crispy on all sides.\n\nRemove the boras with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain the excess oil. Serve hot with sliced shallots and mint and coriander chutney.\n\n\u2018Zaika: Vegan recipes from India\u2019 by Romy Gill, published by Orion Books is out now.
