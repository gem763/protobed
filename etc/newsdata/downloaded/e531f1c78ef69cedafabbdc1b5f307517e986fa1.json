Mazie Hirono (D-HI) criticized her colleague Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) for defending President Donald Trump for referring to the impeachment inquiry as a \u201clynching.\u201d\n\nSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching. But we will WIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nHirono said, \u201cWhen I heard the president use the word \u2018lynching\u2019 with regard to what he\u2019s going through, to liken a constitutional inquiry process to mass murder of blacks by \u2014 murder of blacks by mass mobs in our country is just \u2014 I was so appalled that I hardly had any words to say. For those who are coming forward to defend the president\u2019s use of that word, I just want to say to them, do you not know anything about the history of our country and the racism in our country and the racism in our country? These are \u2014 I\u2019m just appalled.\u201d\n\nHost Jake Tapper said, \u201cThe only person I\u2019ve heard defending the president\u2019s use of the term is your colleague Senator Lindsey Graham. So what would you say to him?\u201d\n\nHirono said, \u201cWell, maybe everybody else will just not go there. That would be good.\u201d\n\nTapper said, \u201cBut what would you say to him if he were in front of you right now because he has used \u2014he said it is a lynching and \u2014he said, quote, it is a lynching in every sense of the word, unquote.\u201d\n\nHirono said, \u201cWould hardly have the words to say to Lindsey now because he has turned 360 on first criticizing the president when he was running for president himself and then turning around and being one of the prime defenders of the president. So Lindsey is\u2014he\u2019s going to say what he\u2019s going to say. I totally disagree with him. And I am just so saddened and appalled by Lindsey\u2019s continuing defense of the president.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Tuesday's broadcast of CNN's \"The Lead,\" Sen.
