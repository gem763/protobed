The market has regained its footing; however, the problem is how to get the kind of momentum needed to get through key resistance that also happens to be all-time highs. Over the past month, investors moved into Financials and Energy looking for value rather than growth-driven Technology stocks.\n\nInvestors rotating among various sectors underscore the fact stocks are generally more attractive than other investment options, but defensive investing isn\u2019t usually the catalyst to get major indices higher.\n\nRight now, the workhorses that powered the market higher are facing their own battles. I don\u2019t think Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), or Apple (AAPL) will be broken up, but they could come under different legal restrictions and oversight, which means more investigations and lots of fines.\n\nA whole lot of fines.\n\nOf course, if these companies can show great performance during this period and not be sidetracked like International Business Machines (IBM) was when it fought government overtures toward a breakup, then these names will probably move back into the driver\u2019s seat in time for a year-end rally.\n\nS&P 500 Index +3.16% Communication Services (XLC) +3.09% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +2.56% Consumer Staples (XLP) +0.28% Energy (XLE) +6.04% Financials (XLF) +6.04% Health Care (XLV) +1.50% Industrials (XLI) +4.36% Materials (XLB) +3.44% Real Estate (XLRE) +1.03% Technology (XLK) +1.50% Utilities (XLU) +3.57%\n\nConstructive\n\nWhen we hear talks were \u201cconstructive,\u201d it allows everyone to take a sigh of relief, especially when it\u2019s associated with trade talks between the United States and China and the comments from their state news agency Xinhua.\n\nPortfolio Approach\n\nLast week, we didn\u2019t do a lot of fresh names, but we have reiterated several open positions. I think current entry points are very attractive, so make sure to contact your rep or research@wstreet.com.\n\nCommunication Services Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples 1 2 1 Energy Financials Healthcare 1 1 2 Industrial Materials Real Estate 3 2 1 Technology Utilities Cash 3 0 3\n\nAutumnal Equinox\n\nI\u2019m a fan of fall, but I get the blues because I know it means winter is right around the corner and will probably stick around for six months. For now, enjoy the season and its crisper air, leaves changing, and a natural uptick in optimism as we head into the holiday season.\n\nIt\u2019s often a great time for the market once we get through the wild gyrations of October, which Goldman Sachs (GS) promises will be crazier than ever \u2013 we\u2019ll see.\n\nAnother Gimmick?\n\nI\u2019ve never been a fan of \u201cpumpkin spice\u201d even though I enjoy an occasional slice of pumpkin pie. I was surprised to learn it\u2019s a blend of spices and contains no pumpkin.\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is at a double top formation and must find a way to breakout soon or could be vulnerable to a big pullback. The last time the index failed to breakout through a double top was October 3, 2018, (see arrow) although that failure comes with an asterisk: it\u2019s when Jay Powell gave an off-the-cuff remark that suggested a pipeline of Fed rate hikes well into 2019.\n\nSo, it turns out China didn\u2019t bolt from a purposed visit to American farms because of President Trump\u2019s firm line on wanting a complete deal, but at the request of the United States. When hatred drives the news or reaction to news, we all lose.\n\nCertainly, algorithms are programmed to sell first and ask questions later, but maybe humans should count a few beats and get facts before acting.", "description": "Friday was a sloppy close to a pensive week.
