And just keep it going. Be nice to end that whole disaster.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cwhole disaster\u201d is apparently a reference to Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukrainian territory, both its seizure of Crimea and its move into the eastern Ukrainian provinces of Donbas and Luhansk. Trump heard that progress had been made on resolving this, perhaps in his July 31 call with Putin.\n\n\u201cI really hope that Russia \u2014 because I really believe that President Putin would like to do something, I really hope that you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem,\u201d Trump added later. \u201cThat would be a tremendous achievement. And I know you\u2019re trying to do that.\u201d\n\nLast week, Zelensky announced his support for the Steinmeier formula, a compromise proposal developed by German politician Frank-Walter Steinmeier in which the separatist provinces in eastern Ukraine could be recognized as self-governing after local elections. While Zelensky insisted that the elections would occur only after Russia withdrew from the area, Ukrainians are concerned that the agreement is a concession that will strengthen Russia\u2019s grip in the region.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Steinmeier formula means Putin\u2019s formula,\u201d former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said in an interview.\n\nAs the Daily Beast reported Friday, Russia agrees. Putin\u2019s press secretary Dmitry Peskov \u2014 last in the news in the U.S. for his office\u2019s contacts with Trump\u2019s attorney Michael Cohen in 2016 \u2014 embraced the development. One commentator on a discussion show on Russian state television tied Zelensky\u2019s acquiescence to Trump: \u201cTrump let Zelensky down. Three times he told him: \u2018Go meet with Putin.' \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s in Russia\u2019s interest to promote the idea that Zelensky\u2019s decision was a function of his facing pressure from Trump. But Ukraine\u2019s embrace of the Steinmeier formula is also not the only recent decision in which Trump has been depicted as aiding Russia.\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) offered his view of Trump\u2019s decision Sunday evening to let Turkey move forward with an operation in northern Syria. The civil war in that country has created a complex mix of competing interests, with Russian allying with Syria\u2019s existing regime and Turkey opposing Kurdish fighters who\u2019d received U.S. military aid.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup,\u201d the statement from McConnell\u2019s office read. \u201cI urge the President to exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s not alone in suggesting that Russia could benefit from Trump\u2019s decision. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a strong Trump ally, described the decision as one that would \u201cabandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran, & Turkey.\u201d The president\u2019s former envoy for the fight against the Islamic State offered a sweeping criticism of Trump on Monday morning \u2014 including describing the decision as \u201ca gift to Russia, Iran\u201d and the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s government was busy celebrating a different geopolitical win that came courtesy of Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the release of a whistleblower complaint centered on that Trump-Zelensky call, new attention was focused on Trump\u2019s other interactions with world leaders. On Friday, The Post detailed a number of alarming examples, including this one involving former British prime minister Theresa May:\n\n\u201cIn a summer 2018 call with Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump harangued the British leader about her country\u2019s contribution to NATO. He then disputed her intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Putin\u2019s government had orchestrated the attempted murder and poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil.\u201d \u201c'Trump was totally bought into the idea there was credible doubt about the poisoning,' said one person briefed on the call. \u2018A solid 10 minutes of the conversation is spent with May saying it\u2019s highly likely and him saying he\u2019s not sure.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Guardian, a British newspaper, seized upon that anecdote under the headline, \u201cTrump told Theresa May he doubted Russia was behind Skripal poisoning\u201d \u2014 a reference to the former spy, Sergei Skripal.\n\nAs with other Russian interventions overseas (including in the United States in the 2016 election), there\u2019s robust evidence that Skripal was in fact targeted by intelligence agents from his former country. As with those other interventions, Russia denies involvement. So Russia\u2019s Embassy in Britain eagerly embraced the Guardian report.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBest evidence that no evidence of Russian involvement exists.https://t.co/nvUojfCmLo \u2014 Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) October 6, 2019\n\nThis is mostly a troll, of course, leveraging Trump\u2019s ongoing denials and diminishment of Russia\u2019s efforts in the presidential election in which he was elected president.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder of the other gift to Russia embedded in Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky.\n\nWhen Zelensky mentioned to Trump that Ukraine might want to purchase more defensive weapons for its struggle against Russia, Trump responded with a request.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csituation\u201d to which he was referring was an odd, unfounded theory related to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 \u2014 a theory in which Russia wasn\u2019t culpable for the crime.\n\nAD", "description": "The U.S. president continues to lay political gifts at Russia's feet.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-aftXJ2TwWCvnHuoFBJtSU-9YEU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DJHAMPHI54I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
