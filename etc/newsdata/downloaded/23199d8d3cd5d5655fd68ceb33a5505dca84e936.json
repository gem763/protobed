Google says it has achieved quantum supremacy, which means the quantum computer did something a conventional computer could never do.\n\n\"For those of us working in science and technology, it\u2019s the \u201chello world\u201d moment we\u2019ve been waiting for\u2014the most meaningful milestone to date in the quest to make quantum computing a reality,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post announcing the breakthrough. \"But we have a long way to go between today\u2019s lab experiments and tomorrow\u2019s practical applications; it will be many years before we can implement a broader set of real-world applications,\" he continued.\n\nCompetitor IBM is disputing that Google achieved the benchmark, saying Google underestimated the conventional supercomputer.\n\nQuantum computing is an advanced computing technology that is still at a relatively early stage of development.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/12/0/0/Sundar-Pichai-TOP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
