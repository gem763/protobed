He does gives us something different.\u201d\n\nMartial, though, is the only senior player Solskjaer will have back for this weekend with Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic and Luke Shaw all still missing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working very hard to get them fit and, hopefully, we can get them back soon,\u201d said Solskjaer. \u201cI\u2019m not going to put a deadline on it but it won\u2019t be long, hopefully.\u201d", "description": "Norwich (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Manchester United travel to Norwich on Sunday hoping the promising performance to hold Premier League leaders", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/833e4d_ole-gunnar-solskjaer-left-is-hoping-return-anthony-martial-spark-manchester-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
