Dan Bishop in the Sept. 10 special election for North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District\u2026during a candidate forum the Fayetteville NAACP hosted \u201c\u2026politicians like state Sen. Bishop,\u201d McCready said at the event,\u2026 \u201cThey don\u2019t believe in public schools. They do anything they can to conduct a war on schools.\u201d \u2026Despite McCready\u2019s accusations that his political opponents lack faith in public schools, he has enrolled some of his own four children, ages 2 to 8, in a Charlotte-based private school with a tuition rate close to $18,000 per student.\n\nThen again, maybe McCready\u2019s hypocrisy isn\u2019t so unusual. Rich politicians in Washington, including Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, routinely send their kids to private school while fighting to deny school choice for others.\n\nWhy?\n\nTo be fair, it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t like kids from poor families. The problem is that they put the interests of teacher unions ahead of the interests of those kids. Public Choice 101.\n\nThat\u2019s despicable.\n\nAnd what\u2019s equally despicable is that the NAACP, where McCready was speaking, also opposes school choice \u2013 even though minority children suffer the most because of the failed government school monopoly.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they\u2019re also bought off by the teacher unions.\n\nI\u2019ll close by directing your attention to this column about the empirical evidence for school choice.\n\nP.S. It\u2019s also uplifting to see very successful school choice systems operate in nations such as Canada, Sweden, Chile, and the Netherlands. And India doesn\u2019t have school choice, but it\u2019s a remarkable example of how private schools are the only good option for poor families that want upward mobility.\n\nP.P.S. The Washington Post provides an example of honest and decent leftism, having editorialized in favor of poor children over teacher unions.", "description": "I\u2019ve shared\u00a0some amazing stories about\u00a0leftist hypocrisy over the years.John Kerry .09/02/2019 3:25:56AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
