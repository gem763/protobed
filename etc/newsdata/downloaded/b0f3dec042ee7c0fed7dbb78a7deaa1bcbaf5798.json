After all, not even Trump claims that he was joking yesterday when he nudged China yesterday to investigate the Bidens while standing on the White House lawn. Some Trumpers did use that excuse in 2016 when he called on Russia at a press conference to \u201cfind\u201d Hillary\u2019s emails, even though that was \u2014 at best \u2014 \u201ckidding on the square.\u201d But yesterday wasn\u2019t a joke. It was part of Trump\u2019s core defense of his Ukraine conduct: It\u2019s not wrong to ask a foreign government to investigate a former U.S. official for corruption, even if that official just so happens to be leading the Democratic polls and even if he just so happens to be the only official you\u2019ve asked about in two and a half years.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Rubio just repeat that defense, however unconvincing it may be, instead of resorting to this \u201cyou got trolled lol\u201d nonsense?\n\nAll I can think is that he\u2019s a broken man at this point. Two and a half years of this circus have finally broken him.\n\nSome people will tell you that Rubio still dreams of being president and that he\u2019s doing what the Ted Cruzes and Josh Hawleys of the world are doing nowadays, pandering to Trump\u2019s populist base and making excuses for the president as needed. I don\u2019t see it. Rubio\u2019s never been a populist and doesn\u2019t go out of his way to pretend otherwise; the most he\u2019ll do is crank out an op-ed now and then arguing unpersuasively that Trump-style nationalism and old-fashioned melting-pot pluralism are kinda sorta the same thing. I also doubt that he\u2019s under any illusions about his viability as a national figure in a party that\u2019s been conquered by white identity politics and a restrictionist view of immigration. Rubio didn\u2019t even want to be a senator again, remember; he was prepared to step away from politics after his failed 2016 presidential campaign until McConnell and the party leadership begged him to run again. That\u2019s not the hallmark of a 2024 hopeful.\n\nSo what\u2019s the point of all this? No matter how much Trump ass he kisses, he\u2019ll always be suspicious to populists thanks to his Gang of Eight membership and his hardcore interventionist foreign policy. I doubt he\u2019d be the choice of moderate Republicans in 2024 either with Nikki Haley waiting in the wings to run. At this point he seems like a zombie senator, a guy who doesn\u2019t want to be in Washington, doesn\u2019t recognize the party around him, doesn\u2019t respect its leader, doesn\u2019t see a future for himself in it, but for some reason can\u2019t muster the will to say any of that out loud. All he can do is mumble \u201clol nothing matters.\u201d\n\nBroken man. And not the first one on the Hill in the Trump era! I was reminded on Twitter that another broken man, Paul Ryan, once resorted to this same lame excuse when Trump was caught saying something he shouldn\u2019t have.\n\nThe punchline is that I suspect Rubio\u2019s post-Trump memoir will be one of the most fulsome in claiming how \u201ctroubled\u201d he was by this entire period. Like Ryan, he\u2019ll find his nerve to voice his concerns the moment it no longer matters.\n\nSomeone should ask him if he\u2019s troubled by this. At this point, I\u2019d be curious to hear his response:\n\n2/ The attorney for the whistleblower declined to comment. The IG said \"such evidence did not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern 'appears credible' particularly given the other information the ICIG obtained during its preliminary review.\" \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 3, 2019\n\nA normal politician would balk at the idea that it\u2019s impossible for a member of one party to credibly report misconduct by a member of the other, but a broken man who now believes \u201clol nothing matters\u201d might lunge at it. Rubio\u2019s top priority at this point is obviously just finding a way not to have to answer uncomfortable questions about Trump. Why not point to the fact that whistleblower is a Democrat as evidence that Trump has been framed, case closed? That would be marginally more convincing than \u201che was trolling about China and the Bidens.\u201d", "description": "\"That's not a real request.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/m-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
