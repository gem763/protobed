And, according to Jenni Middleton, the head of beauty at trend-forecasting agency WGSN (with over 16 years of experience in the health, retail, and beauty industries), an advent calendar is also a way to start \u201cthe self-gifting early\u201d because \u201cwho doesn\u2019t want and need some treats once we start our very busy December schedules?\u201d Since these calendars are already hitting the shelves, we consulted Middleton and Chiu about the best ones to buy right now (eagle-eyed observers may note the exception of the collectible M.A.C calendar, which is sadly only available in the U.K. for now), plus ones that give you much more than you pay for.\n\nSpace NK Advent Calendar A curated assortment from a retailer with good taste is one of the savviest ways to shop for these sets. \u201cSome of the beauty of these is knowing and trusting a particular brand,\u201d says Middleton. \u201cYou trust that whatever you\u2019re going to get from them is going to surprise and delight you.\u201d She cites Space NK\u2019s A Beauty Anthology as a good example of this fact. This year, that means 25 cult favorites like Olaplex\u2019s No. 3 Bond Perfector, Eve Lom\u2019s Original Cleanser, Sunday Riley\u2019s Luna Sleeping Night Oil, and others \u2014 at a fraction of their usual prices. $265 at Space NK Buy\n\nLiberty London Beauty Advent Calendar The Liberty London Advent Calendar \u201cis as eagerly awaited as Santa with his sleigh, as every year it features a great value set of products,\u201d Middleton explains, including 18 full-size products and seven sample sizes, including Diptyque\u2019s Baies Scented Candle, Byredo\u2019s Rose Rinse-Free Hand Wash, and a Nars Blush and Bronzer Duo. The set has already sold out in the U.K., despite increasing production by over 40 percent this year, so we suggest snapping it up fast. $275 at Liberty London Buy\n\nLook Fantastic Advent Calendar \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about a beauty house that has a reputation for pulling together great brands, it\u2019s Look Fantastic,\u201d says Middleton. It doesn\u2019t preview which brands are included in the set until you open it, so if you prefer to be surprised, read no further. But online spoilers reveal that this year we\u2019ll see a Morphe eye-shadow palette, Eyeko Lash Alert Mascara, and Mellow Cosmetics Liquid Lip Paint, among others \u2014 all things that are ideal for executing holiday makeup looks. $99 at Look Fantastic Buy\n\nNet-a-Porter 25 Days of Beauty Advent Calendar For luxury beauty nerds, Net-a-Porter is known for its taste, as well as including products that are often uniquely cult-y and expensive. Chiu calls it \u201ca bit of a beauty splash out,\u201d but is worth it because you can find \u201cluxury skin care, hair and makeup.\u201d The edit is focused on getting you through the taxing holiday-party season, featuring highly pigmented makeup products to get ready with, as well as post-soir\u00e9e skin saviors. This year\u2019s set, for example, clocking in at just over $250, includes some of our most beloved (and pricey) hair and beauty brands at the Strategist, from Dr. Barbara Sturm and Dr. Dennis Gross skin care to Charlotte Tilbury and Sunday Riley \u2014 so this is one we\u2019d recommend scooping up before it sells out. $208 at Net-a-Porter Buy\n\nSephora Collection Frosted Party Advent Calendar At a lower price point, for the person who identifies as a Sephora aficionado. And Middleton loves this affordable Frosted Party advent calendar for its variety. Note that these are exclusively makeup minis from Sephora\u2019s in-house collection, with highlights that include \u201ca charcoal nose strip, eye mask, lip mask, and makeup remover wipes.\u201d $45 at Sephora Buy\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the vendors Diptyque Advent Calendar Beyond a curated potpourri of minis from bigger retailers, beauty-obsessed people might want something more specific to their high-end tastes. The selection from Diptyque \u2014 one of the most cult-y luxury brands \u2014 never fails to disappoint, and this year\u2019s advent calendar contains 25 mini-candles, plus perfumes and oils, for $425 (which, when you consider the cost per item, is still a steal). Middleton says this one hits a sweet spot of being both festive and appropriately lavish: \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to have a candle during the holidays? Anything that\u2019s super-indulgent, with bath and body and luxury, from relaxing candles to relaxing fragrances, or body souffl\u00e9s and body butters, people will want to spend more money on those, especially if they think they\u2019re getting more value out of them.\u201d $425 at Diptyque Buy\n\nL\u2019Occitane Classic Advent Calendar We also like this beauty set from L\u2019Occitane, which tends to be a hit with moms (and people who hoard their hand creams). And when you consider that a single hand cream typically runs for $12 a pop, the fact that you\u2019re getting a pocket-size medley of goodies \u2014 from soaps to creams \u2014 makes this a really nice investment set for the holidays. $64 at Sephora Buy\n\nRituals The Ritual of Advent Calendar Another consistent best seller is Rituals\u2019 advent calendar, whose popularity Middleton attributes to the fact that \u201cRituals has raving fans and such a luxury following.\u201d And it\u2019s got utility beyond your own personal use, she adds: \u201cEveryone\u2019s hosting guests for Christmas, or they\u2019re traveling themselves, so I always think mini-samples are just wonderful to have around the house at Christmas so you can offer something special for your guests to use.\u201d $74 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nElemis 12 Days Of Beauty 12 Piece Collection \u201cElemis always has a great offer behind each window of their advent presentations,\u201d says Middleton. Elemis offers 12 skin-care products from its Pro-Collagen Marine Cream, formulated with powerful marine actives, to its Camellia Tea Seed Oil\u2013enriched Skin Nourishing Body Cream, and more nourishing skin-care products that are ideal for dry winter skin. $145 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nCharlotte Tilbury Magic Moon Advent Calendar Vault For sheer presentation alone (look at all this glitter), plus the hyperpopularity and cost of Charlotte Tilbury products, Middleton also suggested checking out Charlotte Tilbury\u2019s advent calendar of 12 makeup and skin-care staples, from her iconic Pillowtalk lipstick to her deeply rich magic cream. \u201cCharlotte Tilbury\u2019s Glittering Galaxy of Make-up Magic just looks fabulous with lovely glittery gold boxed drawers that reveal enough makeup for two makeup looks and lots of skin-care treats too,\u201d she says. $200 at Sephora Buy\n\nBareMinerals 24 Days of Clean Beauty Advent Christmas For clean beauty lovers, look no further than BareMinerals, says Middleton. \u201cIt offers anyone who buys it a complete skin-care and makeup look,\u201d including lipstick, highlighter, and blush. \u201cI am pretty sure you\u2019d want to use all of these products \u2014 there wouldn\u2019t be any languishing in the back of a bathroom drawer until next Christmas.\u201d $99 at BareMinerals Buy\n\nKiehl\u2019s Limited Edition Advent Calendar According to Middleton, \u201cSustainability is really important to consumers, so calendars that can be reused or refilled will be popular.\u201d Kiehl\u2019s is offering a reusable and refillable organic-cotton advent calendar, with each of the 12 pockets decorated by Finnish illustrator Janine Rewell, making the calendar reusable and something shoppers will want to keep, she says. \u201cThe outer packaging is a seeded bag, which can be planted in the garden,\u201d once the weather warms up. It\u2019s filled with enough masks, serums, cleansers, and moisturizer minis to last you for months \u2014 so at $90, it\u2019s a steal. $90 at Kiehl\u2019s Buy\n\nDr. Barbara Sturm Advent Calendar 2019 For fans of luxury beauty, we suggest Dr. Barbara Sturm\u2019s Advent Calendar, which features 21 of her cult-status skin-care products, including her beloved hyaluronic serum. As Rio explains: \u201cEveryone loves Dr. Barbara Sturm, and I haven\u2019t yet found a product of hers that doesn\u2019t have over-the-top rave reviews.\u201d $575 at Net-a-Porter Buy\n\nESPA Precious Moments Advent Calendar Middleton calls this year\u2019s ESPA calendar \u201csuper-elegant\u201d with \u201clovely gray and gold drawers opening to reveal the Espa classics,\u201d like its Restorative Bath Oil, Skin Rescue Balm, and 24-Hour Replenishing Eye Moisturiser. $242 at Look Fantastic Buy\n\nGLOSSYBOX Beauty Advent Calendar \u201cExpect to find some interesting new brands in the Glossybox advent calendar,\u201d from New York\u2019s Winky Lux to London-based Advant Skincare, says Chiu. \u201cThis affordable advent calendar has 25 products, worth over $500 for a fifth of that price.\u201d $99 at Glossybox Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
