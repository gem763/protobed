I don\u2019t know what the break-down for them was. Just those little things we definitely need to tidy up.\"\n\nAustralia already had winger Reece Hodge suspended for three matches after he went high in a try-saving tackle against Fiji, a ban which infuriated Cheika.\n\nCheika was then further incensed when center Samu Kerevi was penalised when his arm went high when fending off a tackler during the 29-25 Wales loss, a major turning point in the match.\n\nHis rants against the refereeing and World Rugby in general drew criticism in the lead-up to Uruguay, with some Australian media pundits saying they could backfire rather than fire up the team.\n\nThe Wallabies, wearing their green indigenous jersey for the first time at a World Cup, had their third slow start of the tournament against Uruguay, having struggled to get out of the blocks against Fiji in their opener and Wales.\n\nThe yellow cards held them to 19-3 at the break before they overpowered the Uruguayans with a second half featuring some sparkling running rugby.\n\n\"The one thing we need to be mindful of, I think, is we haven\u2019t started games well,\" said Cheika. \"Not that we haven\u2019t played well. We\u2019ve been a little less consistent at that part of the game. That\u2019s something we need to address for sure.\"\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Australia coach Michael Cheika showed a sidestep worthy of David Campese in his prime when declining to weigh in on the Wallabies' high tackling after the problem resurfaced during the victory over Uruguay at the World Cup on Saturday.
