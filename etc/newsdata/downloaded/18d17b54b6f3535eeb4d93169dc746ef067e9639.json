Kaku said a pocketed alien paper clip, alien fork, even a bit of \u201calien dandruff\u201d would yield useful chemical and genetic information to scientists.\n\nIt is, of course, a matter of speculation whether extraterrestrials have hair, let alone dandruff. Drawings based on the descriptions of people who claim to have seen them typically depict them as bald, although there is also believed to be a race of blond humanoid aliens known as \u201cNordics.\u201d\n\nKaku, a well-known science writer, media personality and professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York Graduate Center, also spoke to Yahoo News about assorted planetary matters, including his concerns about a future traffic jam in orbits around the moon, in a separate interview.\n\nEven without extraterrestrial dandruff to analyze, the field of astrobiology, the study of life outside Earth, has been invigorated recently by some provocative findings released over the past 20 months. Researchers have been poring over recently declassified videos shot by U.S. Navy pilots over the East Coast in 2015, showing mysterious flying objects that behave like no known aircraft. Thanks to newly updated radar systems in Navy jets, the videos have aided scientists by providing \u201ctestability\u201d and previously unknown metrics about UFOs. \u201cWe now know they fly between Mach 5 and Mach 20 \u2014 five to 20 times the speed of sound,\u201d Kaku said. \u201cWe know they zigzag so fast that any pilot would be crushed by centrifugal force. That they have no exhaust that we can see.\u201d The explanations usually invoked for UFO sightings \u2014 meteors, weather balloons, even the planet Venus \u2014 can\u2019t explain these live-action high-precision shots, said Kaku, leading to either of two possible conclusions: They are of human origin, representing a technology so cutting-edge that even leading scientists are puzzled by it. Or, he said, \u201cmaybe they are evidence of an advanced outer space civilization.\u201d\n\nCould they be Russian, not Martian? Perhaps, Kaku allowed, given that last year Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that \u201cRussia had built a hypersonic flying vehicle that can zigzag.\u201d The U.S. and China are also working on hypersonic drones. On the other hand, Kaku emphasized, \u201cmaybe they are extraterrestrial.\u201d After all, he noted, the universe is 13.8 billion years old, while earthly science was born merely 300 years ago; on any of 4,000 recently discovered exoplanets, where life as we know it might be able to exist, alien civilizations may well have had much longer to advance their scientific and technological skills.\n\nEven if not smoking-gun proof, the declassified videos \u2014 bolstered by confirmation of multiple sightings of unexplained aerial vehicles during 2014 and 2015, including at least one near-collision \u2014 are giving ufology new weight. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a turning point,\u201d Kaku said. \u201cIt used to be that believers had to prove that these objects were from an intelligent race in outer space. Now the burden of proof is on the government to prove they\u2019re not from intelligent beings in outer space.\u201d\n\nThe possibility that they are vehicles from other planetary civilizations, Kaku told Yahoo, \u201cnow has to be put on the table.\u201d\n\nStill, in the absence of even a molecule of aliens\u2019 DNA, if they have DNA \u2014 Kaku cautioned that pilots in alien spacecraft may be cybernetic or robotic \u2014 astrobiology remains largely a discipline without a material subject matter. Which is why Kaku wants something scientists can touch and examine in the lab, predicting that \u201cit will end the debate right then and there.\u201d\n\nWhatever the state of provability, ETs and spinning discs are again the rage, as evidenced in more than just ticket prices for the three-day Ufology World Congress, which ranged up to $1,600 for premium seating and a \u201cmeet-and-greet\u201d with Kaku.\n\nThe crowd at the Ufology World Congress.

In a throwback to the \u201950s and \u201960s, when sightings of flying saucers were front-page news and TV shows warned viewers not to shake hands with aliens should they encounter them, the media, from Fox News to the New York Times, Politico and the Washington Post, is now giving the topic more airtime and more ink. Congress is demanding more information about UFO sightings as well. New TV shows and documentaries are popping up, among them a series backed by Sony Pictures TV about the 1980 Rendlesham Forest incident, when unidentified aerial vehicles near U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K. were sighted by multiple military witnesses. And there is renewed interest in the 1947 Roswell incident \u2014 when unidentifiable debris from what the U.S. military later said was a weather balloon crashed in New Mexico \u2014 and in Area 51, the classified Nevada military base that conspiracy theorists believe houses captured aliens and their vehicles. This summer, when a 21-year-old Nevada man, Matthew Roberts, posted a public Facebook page calling for a mass march on the base to uncover the truth, some 2 million Facebook users signed on, even though Roberts, as he later admitted, meant it as a joke. The substitute event, a pair of festivals nearby dubbed \u201cAlienstock,\u201d was canceled after Pentagon officials warned civilians to keep away from the installation.\n\nAlien art on display at the Ufology World Congress. (Photo: Jos\u00e9 Colon for Yahoo News) More\n\nAs of last December, only 35 percent of Americans believed aliens have landed on Earth, according to an Economist/YouGov poll, but further intrigue and research into UFOs is being spurred by funding from Tom DeLonge, the frontman for the turn-of-the-millennium pop punk band Blink-182, who founded the science and media venture To the Stars Academy of Arts & Science as \u201ca vehicle for the disclosure of the UFO phenomenon.\u201d\n\nDeLonge is also executive producer of \u201cUnidentified: Inside America\u2019s UFO Investigation,\u201d a six-part documentary on the History Channel, which also airs \u201cAncient Aliens\u201d and \u201cProject Blue Book.\u201d DeLonge\u2019s series explores a shadowy Pentagon initiative called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which was first officially acknowledged in December 2017, when the New York Times ran a front-page article that included links to two declassified videos never before seen by the public.\n\nThe AATIP, which the Pentagon claims was shuttered in 2012, ostensibly was created in 2007 to catalogue aerial threats from foreign countries. But the titles of supplemental reports, which were listed in an unclassified letter to Sen. John McCain obtained by former British Ministry of Defense official Nick Pope (a speaker at the ufology conference), imply that the Defense Department was looking at threats much farther over the horizon than Russia: \u201cTraversable Wormholes,\u201d \u201cInvisibility Cloaks,\u201d \u201cSpace Communication Implications of Quantum Entanglement\u201d and \u201cWarp Drive, Dark Energy and the Manipulation of Extra Dimensions.\u201d The contents of the reports remain secret.\n\nLuis Elizondo, who headed the AATIP and stars in \u201cUnidentified,\u201d is demanding that UFOs be taken more seriously: he marched out of his Defense Department post in October 2017 protesting that the department was ignoring \u201cthe many accounts from the Navy and other services of unusual aerial systems interfering with military weapons platforms and displaying beyond-next-generation capabilities.\u201d Now employed by the To the Stars Academy, he told Politico in April, \u201cIf you are in a busy airport and see something you are supposed to say something. With our own military members it is kind of the opposite: \u2018If you do see something, don\u2019t say something.\u2019\u201d\n\nArtwork on display at the Ufology World Congress. (Photo: Jos\u00e9 Colon for Yahoo News) More\n\nUFO believer Robert Bigelow, owner of Bigelow Aerospace, which conducted secret research for the AATIP, and who prior to that ran a hush-hush \u201cUFO lab\u201d on his Skinwalker Ranch in Utah, the subject of a recent documentary, despairs of the \u201cjuvenile taboo\u201d he says attaches to research on the subject. Christopher Mellon, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence who consults for To the Stars, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last year that the Pentagon\u2019s don\u2019t-bother-us-with-alien-spacecraft attitude is \u201ca serious and recurring impediment to progress,\u201d akin to \u201chaving the Army conduct a submarine search without the Navy.\u201d \u201cNobody wants to be \u2018the alien guy\u2019 in the national security bureaucracy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNobody wants to be ridiculed.\u201d\n\nThe calls to make the study of UFOs more respectable got a boost at the Barcelona conference from appearances by Kaku and other serious speakers, including researchers and a government official, but there was also a large representation of enthusiasts and eccentrics. One self-declared expert on the relationship between humans and extraterrestrials warned the audience that aliens are coming to Earth to enslave humans and eat their babies.\n\nEven so, the general tone was upbeat. \u201cWe\u2019re in game-changing, paradigm-busting territory,\u201d said Pope, who for 21 years worked in the U.K.\u2019s Ministry of Defense, including four during the 1990s when he headed Britain\u2019s UFO program. He said that during his years there the program \u201cnever found proof you could take to the bank,\u201d but neither did it conclude that UFOs were definitively not from outside Earth.\n\nNick Pope onstage at the Ufology World Congress. (Photo: Jos\u00e9 Colon for Yahoo News) More\n\nWhen the U.K. began allowing Freedom of Information requests 15 years ago, many files from the UFO program were opened up. Pope said UFOs are the topic that Brits most often ask their government about. Citing reports from European governments as well as the U.S. and accounts of sightings by \u201cpolice officers, pilots and military personnel,\u201d he said in an interview that he hopes to \u201cbring the subject out of the fringe and into the mainstream.\u201d\n\nPrior to the 1990s, Pope \u201chad no interest in the topic at all \u2014 I was simply assigned it as a government job.\u201d Now he believes that \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d at least some UFOs may be of extraterrestrial origin. \u201cThere\u2019s no smoke without fire. When you put it all together, even if 99 percent are misidentification and hoaxes, you only need to prove one. The skeptics have to be right every day, but the believers only have to be right once.\u201d\n\nJan Harzan at the Ufology World Congress. (Photo: Jos\u00e9 Colon for Yahoo News) More\n\nFormer IBM executive Jan Harzan, executive director for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), which has been cataloguing and investigating reports of UFOs for 50 years, was more emphatic: \u201cWe are definitely not alone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact!\u201d He has believed this since his childhood, when he and his brother witnessed a UFO in their backyard in Thousand Oaks, Calif., where the boys played around with radio equipment and tried to conduct experiments with antimatter. Harzan said the great majority of the 500 or more reports his organization receives monthly are dismissed, but \u201cwe think about 5 percent appear to be legitimate.\u201d\n\nThat implies around 300 genuine sightings of alien craft a year, and not even a speck of dandruff to show for it.\n\nOr is there? Mexican journalist Jaime Maussan spoke about the possibility that three-fingered mummies from Peru contain alien DNA (if alien life is, in fact, DNA-based). J.J. and Desiree Hurtak, both social scientists, spoke about pyramids on Mars and how Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were among those who believed they\u2019d witnessed UFOs, which they said have also been spotted near the site of the destroyed nuclear power plant at Fukushima, Japan. \u201cWe believe [extraterrestrials] are not happy with nuclear energy,\u201d said Desiree, while J.J. explained that during a vision he had in 1973, he was given a world map that showed him precisely where to find the footprints of giants in South Africa, as outlined in his book \u201cThe Keys of Enoch.\u201d In an interview with Yahoo, they said they \u201chave evidence\u201d of a number of alien corpses. \u201cMichio Kaku says [scientists] need [alien] tissue samples,\u201d noted J.J. \u201cWe\u2019re suggesting there already are tissue samples. All are under top-secret control, and they won\u2019t be available for several years.\u201d\n\nAt the table from right: Desiree and J.J. Hurtak, Antonio Portugal and Nick Pope take part in a panel at the Ufology World Congress. (Photo: Jos\u00e9 Colon for Yahoo News) More\n\nThe conference spanned three days of lectures and workshops, exploring the diversity of UFO craft (shaped like barbells, cigars, shiny orbs or even Tic Tacs), the numerous varieties of alien races (from the lizard-like Dracos and large-eyed, hairless Greys to the tall, human-like Nordics), and the phenomena of crop circles, lucid dreaming, pineal gland stimulation and preparing for alien arrivals by learning \u201cthe language of light.\u201d Some of the attendees said they\u2019d seen UFOs, and one claimed to actually be from Mars, bearing the message that humans needed to love each other. Spanish media celebrities ambled about, some doing interviews, some giving impromptu talks \u2014 among them parapsychology investigator Sergio Ruiz, who broadcasts five radio shows in Spain. His reason for coming from the Basque country to the conference: demonic possession. Ruiz said he\u2019d recently completed a Vatican course on the subject. According to him, the first thing that\u2019s taught is that victims of possession may in fact have been overtaken by extraterrestrials.\n\nAs to why those from outer space would have any interest in Earth, most speakers said they were coming in peace and to help humanity. Harzan, MUFON\u2019s director, said that most messages conveyed to those whose experiences MUFON believed were legitimate concerned saving the planet from destruction.\n\nScene at the Ufology World Congress. (Photo: Jos\u00e9 Colon for Yahoo News) More\n\nBut one of the final speakers of the ufology congress, American author Alfred Webre, a self-described \u201cinternational lawyer\u201d who writes books about \u201cexopolitics\u201d \u2014 the politics between Earthlings and aliens \u2014 raised the most alarming possibility: that extraterrestrials are coming to Earth to recruit human slave labor. \u201cThere are some estimates that 60 million humans are enslaved in industrial facilities in the solar systems, producing products used through the galaxy,\u201d he told Yahoo. Even worse, he said, some aliens, specifically the race known as Draco-Reptilians, believed to come from the Orion constellation, have a taste for human babies.\n\nWebre, who said he previously worked for the Stanford Research Institute, now SRI International, claimed he headed a project called the Extraterrestrial Communication Study, established early in the Carter administration but \u201cstopped in its tracks by the Pentagon in October 1977.\u201d The reason, he said: The project was about to expose the fact that \u201cthe United States has had secret treaties with certain extraterrestrial civilizations\u201d \u2014 Orion Greys and Draco-Reptilians, to be specific \u2014 going back to FDR\u2019s time. He said our world is actually being overseen by a regional galactic government of \u201cseven or eight civilizations.\u201d\n\nFor all his lurid depictions of extraterrestrials, Webre had come to deliver good news in his speech at the congress. \u201cThe famous Brazilian prophet Xico Xavier,\u201d he said, made a prediction on July 20, 1969, \u201cthe same day the U.S. allegedly landed on the moon.\u201d In 50 years from that day, said Webre, \u201cif World War III hadn\u2019t broken out by then,\u201d it would never happen, and humanity \u201cwould be rejoining the galactic community of nations\u201d \u2014 to which he hopes to be an Earthly representative.\n\nHis message was so crucial that Webre posted on his Facebook page that Hurricane Dorian was a \u201cweather warfare event,\u201d meant to interrupt or overshadow his talk at the conference and the impending \u201creunification of Earth humanity with peaceful galactic communities.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, Barcelona media broke the news that two tornadoes had touched down in the city, in which tornadoes are a rarity \u2014 the first about 3 miles north of the hotel, the second about 3 miles south. And they\u2019d touched down just before Webre was to speak.\n\nYahoo News contributor Melissa Rossi is a U.S. journalist based in Spain.\n\nScene from the Ufology World Congress.
