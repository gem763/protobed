Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said during a speech at the C40 World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen that her dreams of motherhood now \u201ctaste bittersweet\u201d due to climate change.\n\nThe freshman lawmaker delivered a speech at the summit this week and emotionally declared that her dreams of motherhood \u201ctaste bittersweet\u201d because of climate change and the impact it will have on \u201cour children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u201cI speak to you not as an elected official or public figure. But I speak to you as a human being,\u201d she began.\n\n\u201cA woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bittersweet because of what I know about our children\u2019s future and that our actions are responsible for bringing their most dire possibilities into focus,\u201d she continued, audibly holding back tears.\n\n\u201cI speak to you as a daughter and descendant of colonized peoples who have already begun to suffer,\u201d she added, citing the thousands of Puerto Rican lives lost due to Hurricane Maria, which she described as a \u201cclimate change powered storm.\u201d\n\nShe said her grandfather died in the aftermath along with others, all because \u201cthey were living under colonial rule, which contributed to the dire conditions and lack of recovery.\u201d\n\nDozens of C40 mayors called for a \u201cGlobal Green New Deal\u201d to address the mounting environmental concerns.\n\n\u201cAs mayors our first priority is to protect the safety of our citizens,\u201d C40 chair, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said. \u201cIt will soon be four years since the Paris Agreement was signed in our city.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorld leaders met in New York just last month and once again failed to agree anything close to the level of action necessary to stop the climate crisis,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cThere is no other solution but a Global Green New Deal to be the pivotal instrument to win this race against the clock. All decision-makers must take responsibility in making it a reality,\u201d she added.\n\nThis is far from the first time the socialist lawmaker has painted a dark picture of the future over concerns related to climate change. She told viewers during a live video on social media in August that she wants to \u201cperhaps have one less child\u201d due to the looming threat.\n\n\u201cEven now, you know, when you put climate change on top of that, I know that I want to perhaps have one less child than I thought I would maybe have,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI think having a mixed family is part of my personal planning. But it\u2019s really hard, and I don\u2019t think sometimes that older generations understand how much we\u2019re taking this into account,\u201d she added:", "description": "AOC said during a speech at the C40 World Mayors Summit that her dreams of motherhood now \"taste bittersweet\" due to climate change.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Ocasio-Cortez-in-Glasses-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
