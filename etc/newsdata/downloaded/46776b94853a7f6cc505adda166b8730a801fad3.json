Blue-chip housebuilders Persimmon (L: ) and Berkeley (L: ) added more than 1% each.\n\nThe mid-morning proceedings took the spotlight away from good news overnight that the United States and China will resume trade talks next month.\n\nAfter its steepest monthly fall this year amid escalating trade tensions and recession fears in August, the blue-chip index has rebounded this month as various central banks have cut interest rates to counteract slowing global growth.\n\nAmong a few notable news-driven movers was mid-cap A.G. Barr (L: ) which jumped 6% after the soft drinks maker stuck to its annual forecast despite a \"disappointing\" first half.\n\nAmong smaller stocks, Metro Bank (L: ) sank almost 17% to a new life-low, as the troubled lender ditched a 250 million pound bond issue on Monday after failing to attract investors.\n\n\"It shows the kind of mire Metro is in after the accounting error and now expanding FCA investigation ... this is a worrying sign that the bank is not able to raise fresh debt and/or capital when the going gets tough,\" Wilson said.\n\nAIM-listed ad agency M&C Saatchi (L: ) slid 12% to its lowest in more than seven years after warning annual profit would fall 5%-10% below estimates.", "description": "FTSE 100 falls as Supreme Court ruling lifts pound", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8N0FO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
