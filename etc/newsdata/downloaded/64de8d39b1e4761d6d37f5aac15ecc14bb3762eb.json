Garoppolo tore his ACL in the middle of the season and the team finished with the second-worst record in the NFL.\n\nThere was a positive to take away from last season: the emergence of tight end George Kittle, who will likely become Garoppolo\u2019s top target during the 2019 season. Kittle had more than 1,000 yards and five touchdown catches in his first season at the Niners\u2019 starting tight end.\n\nMarquise Goodwin and Dante Pettis also return to the team\u2019s wide receiving core.\n\nSan Francisco would have hoped to have their top draft pick Nick Bosa on the defensive line to start the season but an ankle sprain has at least put things into question for him heading into Week 1.\n\nThe Niners added Dee Ford in the offseason from the Kansas City Chiefs. Ford forced seven fumbles and recorded 13 sacks in 2018.\n\nThe NFC West is going to be a tough division to win. But a six-win season for San Francisco would be a major improvement considering how disastrous last season was.\n\nRead below for more about the 49ers heading into the 2019 season.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n--\n\n2019 SCHEDULE\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nQB: Jimmy Garoppolo\n\nWR: Marquise Goodwin\n\nTE: George Kittle\n\nDE: Dee Ford\n\nDE: Nick Bosa\n\nCB: Richard Sherman\n\n49ERS DRAFT PICKS\n\nRound 1, Pick 2: Nick Bosa, DL Round 2, Pick 36: Deebo Samuel, WR Round 3, Pick 67: Jalen Hurd, WR Round 4, Pick 110: Mitch Wishnowsky, P Round 5, Pick 148: Dre Greenlaw, LB Round 6, Pick 176: Kaden Smith, TE Round 6, Pick 183: Justin Skule, T Round 6, Pick 198: Tim Harris, CB\n\nRECENT STORIES", "description": "Let's look at the San Francisco 49ers' upcoming season.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
