We\u2019ve won it twice so everyone is playing because they want to win.\n\n\u2018He [Ozil] can helps us and tonight is a good opportunity with him. He knows his team-mates and he knows how we play.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s playing in his best position and we want him to use his qualities in this shape. Physically I feel he can be good and perhaps he can play the full 90 minutes.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer Arsenal ace Alan Smith, meanwhile, called for a line to be drawn in the sand after the Granit Xhaka incident but insists the Swiss should apologise.\n\nXhaka \u2013 who responded angrily to Arsenal fans booing him in a 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace \u2013 wasn\u2019t named among Emery\u2019s squad for the trip to Anfield, with Hector Bellerin captaining the side in the team leader\u2019s absence.\n\nMany have questioned whether the midfielder can be reintegrated to the side after his actions, but Smith hopes everyone can forgive and forget.\n\nXhaka has come under fire (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018He\u2019s clearly sticking by his guns and doesn\u2019t feel he\u2019s done too much wrong,\u2019 Smith said. \u2018It would be in his best interests to apologise, for his sake and the club\u2019s and supporters.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think the fans should have given him the welcoming committee they did as he walked off but it\u2019s done now and a line needs to be drawn, and the best way for that to happen is probably for him to say I\u2019m sorry I did what I did, let\u2019s go forward as one. If he doesn\u2019t apologise, it all rumbles on.\u2019\n\nOn the choice to captain Bellerin, Emery added: \u2018It\u2019s my decision who is the captain and tonight I made the decision to give it to Hector Bellerin.\u2019\n\nMORE: Alan Smith slams Unai Emery as he finally starts Mesut Ozil for Arsenal against Liverpool", "description": "Unai Emery recalled Mesut Ozil to the starting line-up for Arsenal's trip to Liverpool for Wednesday night's Carabao Cup clash.
