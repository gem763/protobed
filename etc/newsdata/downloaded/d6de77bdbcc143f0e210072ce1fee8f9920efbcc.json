Trump Won.", "language": "en", "text": "The gap between President Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve chairman he appointed has narrowed considerably.\n\nA year ago, Powell and his fellow officials at the Federal Reserve were in the midst of a monetary poilicy they described as \u201cnormalization\u201d and which required gradual rate hikes. The Fed hiked rates four times in 2018, provoking Trump to describe Powell as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cout of control.\u201d\n\nThis was described, falsely, as an unprecedented breach of decorum by Trump. (Ronald Reagan had been sharply critical of the Fed and its then-chairman Paul Volcker the early 1980s.) Perhaps more importantly, Trump view that monetary policy was too tight was derided as wrong.\n\n\u201cEconomists surveyed by The Washington Post overwhelmingly think Powell is right to raise the benchmark U.S. interest rate Wednesday to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent,\u201d Heather Long of the Washington Post wrote. \u201cTwenty-seven out of the 32 surveyed said the economy is strong enough to handle a more \u2018normal\u2019 interest rate that is closer to 3 percent.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Fed announced its third rate cut of the year. The Fed\u2019s target is now 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent\u2013around half of what all those economists overwhelmingly said was \u2018normal.\u2019 Trump won.\n\nPowell said believes the central has provided the appropriate amount of monetary accommodation based on where it sees the economy\u2019s likely path. But he also provided reassurance that the Fed would not resume hiking rates unless there was a significant uptick in inflation.\n\nIn other words, the normalization era is over. No longer will the Fed raise rates just because it thinks normal rates should be higher. It will only hike to stave off inflation\u2013and the risk of higher inflation is very low right now.\n\nSo hikes are off the table. But further cuts are only on hold. If the economy weakens, the Fed will return to cutting. So the Fed is more or less writing a one-way insurance policy on the economy: if things go well, rates will stay where they are. If the economy slumps, we\u2019ll get more cuts.\n\nThere gap between Trump and the Fed has not completely closed, of course. The Fed sees the normal pace of growth for the U.S. economy at about 1.8 percent, lower than it has been any time this year. The president thinks the economy could grow much faster\u2013especially if the Fed was willing to cut more.\n\nIt is worth noting that Trump did not attack the Fed or Powell on twitter following the central banks\u2019 interest rate decision. Maybe some of the tension has eased along with the interest rate.", "description": "Fed chair Jerome Powell cut rates and promised he would only hike if inflation posed a significant threat.", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/donald-trump-fist-pump-usa-open-for-business-getty-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
