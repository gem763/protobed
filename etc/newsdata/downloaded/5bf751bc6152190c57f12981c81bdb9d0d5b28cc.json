I\u2019m proud of the judgment he made.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s supporters say he did fine, but fine isn\u2019t going to be good enough. With apologies, a sports metaphor is apt. Joe Biden looks like a pro in training camp\u2014running at half speed, joshing with teammates, showing brief flashes of former skills. Democrats who think Mr. Biden will get better than this training-camp competence are deluding themselves. Come next year\u2019s October presidential debates, Donald Trump would flatten him.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Henninger", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
