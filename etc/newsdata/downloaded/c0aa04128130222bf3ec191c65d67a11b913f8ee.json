Rodriguez said in her apology she\u2019s a longtime Fugees and Lauryn Hill fan and didn\u2019t mean to offend anyone.\n\nShe sang along to \u201cReady or Not\u201d and recited the racial slur as she sat in a makeup chair.\n\nSome of the outrage focused on remarks Rodriguez made last year during a panel discussion. She said black women in Hollywood are paid more than Latina women. Detractors at the time noted the highest paid TV actress in the world that year was Sofia Vergara, from Colombia.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gina Rodriguez has apologized for singing along on her Instagram story to a Fugees verse that includes the N-word.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/people-gina_rodriguez_26796_c0-197-2044-1389_s1200x700.jpg?5197ccbb07a8d1c883cb3cafd496967706322af1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
