The policy is only the latest of many Trump administration moves to restrict both legal and illegal immigration.\n\nMcAleenan argued in a Washington Post interview earlier this month that he lacked control over the messaging from his department. He also said the Trump administration \u201cwent too far\u201d when it decided to separate thousands of migrant parents and children at the southwest border in 2018, a move he recommended at the time.\n\nMcAleenan tried several times to begin his speech Monday, but protesters repeatedly interrupted him.\n\n\u201cAs a career law enforcement professional, I\u2019ve dedicated my career to protecting the right to free speech and all the values we hold dear in America,\u201d he said, attempting to address the disruptions.\n\niBut protesters quickly interrupted him again, eventually forcing him to leave the stage.\n\nThe event\u2019s organizers unsuccessfully tried to convince protesters to allow the speech to proceed.\n\n\u201cDemocracy requires dialogue, it requires listening,\u201d said MPI President Andrew Selee.\n\nThe liberal group CREDO Action said it took the lead organizing the protest. Georgetown Law students also demonstrated outside the event.\n\n\"No Trump henchmen should be given a platform to spread hatred or defend the racist, xenophobic policies put into place by Donald Trump and Stephen Miller,\" CREDO Action campaign director Nicole Regalado said in a written statement after the action. The group had circulated an open letter days earlier that called on event organizers to rescind McAleenan\u2018s invitation.\n\nMorning Shift Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

The immigration court backlog has nearly doubled under Trump and now stands at more than a million cases, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. As a result, immigrants can wait years for the resolution of their cases.\n\n\u201cIf we are unable to achieve fair and expeditious immigration results, with due process, and effectively repatriate those without valid claims to remain in the U.S., more will pay smugglers and make the journey and crisis levels of arrivals will continue,\u201c McAleenan said.\n\nHe also touted the Trump administration\u2019s response to the border surge. Border arrests \u2014 a metric used to determine illegal crossings \u2014 dropped to 51,000 in August, down from a peak of 133,000 in May.\n\nDespite the progress, McAleenan asserted that illegal entries remain at \u201ccrisis levels.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6e/8b/1ddd93ca4acf97bb9a2414100ea1/mcaleenan.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
