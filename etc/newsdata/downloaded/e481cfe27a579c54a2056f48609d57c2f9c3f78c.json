Time to turn your 'running-through-the-sprinkler' dreams into dreams of reading under a fuzzy blanket, eating chicken pot pie and watching the snow fall over a hot cup of something. Before you get too comfy though, consider that you're going to be spending a lot of time at home over the next few months \u2014 does your cocoon need a zhuzh? A fresh coat of paint and a few accessories can make spending winter afternoons at home a more inspiring experience, so we asked some of our favourite Canadian design experts what paint colours they're crushing on right now and how to use them as inspiration for a complete room design.\n\nSteven Sabados, Designer/Artist\n\nPaint colour: Farrow & Ball, Hay\n\nTrim colour: Farrow & Ball, All White\n\nSS: There should be three elements in a well-decorated room. First, it needs a mood. The mood or feeling you want to create is usually generated by the wall colour. So, do you want the room to feel energetic and active, or calm, cozy and encapsulating? The starting point for this space is Hay, from Farrow & Ball, which is a beautiful and on-trend neutral yellow tone. Designers are shying away from the world of beige and bringing in hues of warmer tones to create more inviting living spaces . The beauty of this warm colour is that it has a green undertone so your walls won't look overly yellow and \"buttery\", but instead, very earthy.\n\nSo, you've decided on the wall colour and the mood, the next required element is something unexpected \u2014 something that trips your senses. This could be an unusual conversation piece, an accessory, or mismatched side lamps at either end of a sofa. I created this oversized artwork for my new studio line and its generous proportions definitely make a statement.\n\nThe faceted and linear nature of the painting has influenced the geometric lighting choices and decorative accessories.\n\nFinally, there should be somewhere for your eyes and mind to rest so I chose a monochromatic sofa, void of contrasting decorative cushions. The overall feeling of this room is elegant, trendy and energetic.\n\nSource guide\n\nGeo artwork by Steven Sabados Studio\n\nTwig brushed gold Chandelier by Steven Sabados, S&C\n\nMonrovia area rug, Renwil\n\nWhite ceramic accessories, Lee / Martins, Renwil\n\nLewis armless swivel chair, Elte\n\nFlooring - Sombra - Organic Hard Maple - by Lauzon\n\n1930's French trolley bar cart, Restoration Hardware\n\nBeacon floor lLamp, Powell and Bonnell, Southhill Home\n\nBlack iron circular sculpture (round accessory), Elte\n\nLozi mortar stools, Snob\n\nCeline sofa by Steven Sabados, S&C\n\nHudson Shagreen tray rectangular coffee sable, Restoration Hardware\n\nLisa Worth\n\nPaint colour: Farrow & Ball, Strong White\n\nLW: No matter what your style, your living room should be a curated space that reflects your personality and life. The client I designed this space for recently moved back to North America after a brief work stint in London. She wanted a chic space with playful touches rooted in traditional elements. Loving the bones of her former London loft, with ornate crown mouldings, vintage doors and rod iron windows, my goal was to create a space with a Euro chic vibe.\n\nAs a high profile attorney, her living room provides an oasis to escape her demanding work schedule and sip ros\u00e9 with girlfriends.\n\nI searched and searched for the perfect white. The white I chose has a slight gray undertone giving it complete flexibility for all schematics, providing the perfect backdrop for the artwork and furnishings to shine.\n\nTextural sisal rugs and ornate gold Trumeau mirrors lend an Old World elegance and contrast with the sleek lines of the slab black and white marble fireplace. Lucite drapery rods with square brass rings top white linen drapery that break on the floor, setting the tone for a relaxed vibe. Chic animal print cushions adorn white sofas upholstered in mohair velvet and Italian modern occasional tables deliver an unexpected pop of colour and provide the perfect spot to rest a wine glass.\n\nSource guide\n\nLiving room image \u2013 Design, Emma Donnersberg \u2013 Photography, Stephan Julliard\n\nBlue bar cabinet, D\u00e9cor Pad, Chango and Co.\n\nWall sconce, EQ3\n\nAnimal cushions, Etsy\n\nMirror, Restoration Hardware\n\nOccasional tables, Holly Hunt Design\n\nDrapery hardware, Etsy\n\nAccessories (vase and brass sculpture), Kelly Wearsler\n\nWhite oak flooring, Northern Wide Plank\n\nOlivia Botrie, Principal Designer, Dart Studio\n\nPaint colour: Farrow & Ball, De Nimes\n\nTrim colour: Farrow & Ball, De Nimes\n\nOB: I was drawn to this colour because of its cozy, moody quality that creates a relaxed family setting. A matte finish on the walls, and a satin version of the same colour on the trim gives the room a warm, enveloping feeling and I chose limestone for the fireplace that I imagine this space having, to enhance that cozy feeling.\n\nMy goal was to layer colour and pattern for a room that encourages relaxation and conversation \u2014 anything to make those teens talk! To avoid an overly-sophisticated feeling, I chose a mix of warm bohemian prints in heavy duty fabrics that will be comfortable and stand the test of time in a busy family space.\n\nSource guide (clockwise from chair leather)\n\nChair leather, Robin Bruce\n\nSofa fabric, pattern CF103-19, color code W, Robin Bruce\n\nPillow fabric, Caravan in terracotta, Brook Perdition Textiles\n\nPillow fabric, Tobermory Felt in Flannel, Tonic Living\n\nFloor, Nadurra wood, Pure Neue Chamonix\n\nHardware, Upper Canada\n\nOttoman fabric, Valentina velvet in paprika, Tonic Living\n\nPillow fabric, Dandaloo in deepest indigo, Rapture and Wright\n\nVintage rug\n\nVariegated Indiana Limestone in Sawn Bed, Mason's Masonry\n\nHardware, Upper Canada\n\nDrapery fabric, windowpane linen in Stone, Tonic living\n\nDeb Nelson\n\nPaint colour: Benjamin Moore, Hale Navy\n\nTrim colour: Benjamin Moore, Cloud White\n\nDN: I chose a dark navy paint colour which adds drama to any space \u2014 navy, dark charcoal or even black can be an instant game changer in a living room \u2014 suddenly your artwork, furnishings and light fixtures pop!\n\nA cream slipcovered sofa and a pair of caramel leather chairs are grounded by the texture of a sisal rug and, to add more interest, an antique rug is layered on top. Be sure to include lots of bright cushions on the sofa to add some additional colour and choose a gorgeous, textured linen fabric for drapery. A coffee table with a chunky leg and a touch of gold ( gold and aged brass accents are ideal with navy) adds visual interest and an antique console to house stacks of books and stylish accessories will contrast nicely against the navy wall. The artwork hung above the console can be placed gallery style, using a few unique pieces in a variety of frame colours that contrast with the navy walls. A caramel-coloured leather-wrapped floor lamp with a cream shade finishes off the room and completes the luxurious, sophisticated look.\n\nSource guide\n\nSisal rug\n\nVintage rug, Elte\n\nLinen drapery\n\nSofa, Cisco Brothers\n\nGreen pillow, Shoppe by Amber Interiors\n\nToss cushions, Anthropologie\n\nChair, CB2\n\nCoffee table, Anthropologie\n\nFloor lamp, Ralph Lauren Furniture\n\nArtwork and accessories, Serena & Lily\n\nLindsay Agnew, Lead Designer, Si & Oui\n\nPaint colour: Benjamin Moore, Goldsmith\n\nTrim colour: Benjamin Moore, Chantilly Lace\n\nLA: There is no question that gold has been back in a big way for a while now, but the trend hasn't really moved up the wall into paint. I think it's time to change that. This pallet is inspired by the beauty of yellow onyx and the natural golden tones in its banding. Goldsmith by Benjamin Moore has the earthiness I was after and is the starting point for this living room plan.\n\nThe warmth of golden yellow makes it perfect for a gathering space. Goldsmith is the proverbial warm hug of this room, but because the colour is so bold it can easily overwhelm it. In order to combat that, I balanced it with cool greys, crisp whites and subdued golden yellow accents. Natural light and ambient light will affect the way you see this colour and it will appear to change throughout the day. With that in mind, I keep this room monochromatic so the gold would not compete with any other colours as the light changes.\n\nThis room is meant to be used, and all the finishes cater to someone who does not want to think twice before using their space. The moodboard was assembled with longevity and durability in mind; this room can withstand everything from house guests drinking wine on the sofa to the family dog running through the room covered in dirt.\n\nSource guide\n\nFlooring, Greek Villa, Twelve Oaks Vinyl Floor\n\nHardware, Merlot Suite Pewter, Lee Valley\n\nWallpaper, Brunschwig & Fils Les Touches - Canary, Kravet\n\nArea rug, Mickey Grey/Yellow 100% Viscose, Elte Mkt\n\nGrey fabric, Quercus and Co.

And no, you don't need to be scared of painting your room a dark colour. As long as there's sufficient ambient (all-over) lighting, thoughtful accent lighting and effective task lighting, dark paint like Hague Blue is sophisticated, comfortable and welcoming. I would pair it with a deep bone trim like Farrow & Balls Old White. Although not white, against the Hague Blue it will appear almost white without a stark contrast.\n\nBooks, collectibles and textures are set off by this deep navy hue. It's all about maximum comfort without sacrificing absolute sophistication. To set off the dark navy walls, I would use light ivory or bone upholstered pieces mixing velvets, boucles and leathers. Ivory wool drapery falls elegantly and keeps the room from being too shadowy. I would inject blue's complementary colour, orange (and a hint of pink,) in the rug and artwork. Darkened brass accents gleam against the dark walls, white accessories harmonize the colour story and a lucite mirror with pearl-like accents bounces light around this stylish and elegant space.\n\nSource guide\n\nHeathered wool drapery, Restoration Hardware\n\nArt, Wild Peaches / Mark Lijftogt\n\nKoi's Mo's chair, Athens\n\nLounge chair, Baker\n\nIndentation vases, Global Views\n\nShield drink table, Baker\n\nTourmaline mirror, Baker\n\nStardust rug, W Studio\n\nPompeii cocktail table, Baker\n\nMax sofa, Baker\n\nThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n\nPortia Corman is the executive producer of CBC Life.", "description": "Don\u2019t worry, we got them to do storyboards, too.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5319016.1570830977!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/michelle-mawby-colour-story-mood-board.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
