Arsenal winter transfer targets 1/10 Arsenal winter transfer targets Josh Kroenke has promised Arsenal plan to be \u2018proactive\u2019 in the winter transfer market. But who could they sign? Getty 2/10 Wilfried Zaha Arsenal have not completely given up on prizing Wilfried Zaha away from Crystal Palace. He won't come cheap ... but for the right price Palace may be tempted to cash in, particularly if the 26-year-old fails to impress in the first half of the season. Getty Images 3/10 Eduardo Camavinga The 16-year-old - who enjoyed a breakthrough performance against PSG in Ligue 1 last weekend - is also a target for Manchester United, City and Tottenham. Arsenal could attempt to replicate their William Saliba deal with Saint-\u00c9tienne by signing Camavinga and then immediately loaning him back to current club, Rennes. AFP/Getty Images 4/10 Dayot Upamecano If Josh Kroenke is true to his word, and his family do back the club in the winter market, than 20-year-old defender Dayot Upamecano is surely the first player they will attempt to sign. Arsenal came close to landing him this summer, only to balk at Leipzig's \u00a355m price tag having so recently spent a club-record \u00a372m on Nicolas Pepe. Bongarts/Getty Images 5/10 Samuel Umtiti Arsenal will monitor the first half of the 25-year-old's season at Barcelona very closely. The defender's 2018/19 season was hampered by injury and Unai Emery has gone on record about how much he rates the World Cup winner. Icon Sport via Getty Images 6/10 Daniele Rugani Juventus are desperate to get rid of the defender as they scramble to balance the books ahead of this week's Italian transfer deadline. If they fail to offload Rugani he will certainly be available in the winter, and could make a good cut-price solution if Arsenal do indeed manage to sell Shkodran Mustafi this month. AFP/Getty Images 7/10 Robert Arboleda Arsenal came very close to signing the Ecuador international Robert Arboleda from S\u00e3o Paulo on transfer deadline day, instead snapping up David Luiz. But if they are short in defence in five months time, the 27-year-old would make a sensible purchase, especially considering his club were willing to sell. AFP/Getty Images 8/10 Fagner Conserva Another South American defender that Arsenal have preciously explored signing, that they could move for if necessary in January. Plays for Edu's former club Corinthians, which would help speed up any deal. AP 9/10 Everton Arsenal seriously explored signing the 23-year-old Brazil international this summer, but were deterred by his rapidly escalating price tag. But if they are backed by Josh Kroenke this winter, could they return for the Gr\u00eamio star? A move to Europe surely beckons for the electric forward, who won the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica top scorer award this summer.

Getty Images\n\n\u201cOf course mistakes are here, but it\u2019s not an excuse and next time we have to do better. We are very disappointed, we had a good first half and then we came out and played so bad in the second half.\n\n\u201cWe paid for that. We knew they had nothing to lose and they would come for us but we didn\u2019t show our game, we were too scared, nobody wanted the ball.\n\n\u201cEvery team in the Premier League is strong enough to score so you have to stay calm, be mentally strong and we weren\u2019t today.\u201d\n\nWhile Unai Emery bemoaned Watford\u2019s superior physicality.\n\n\u201cPhysically they are more stronger than us,\u201d the Spaniard claimed. \u201cSo we want to break the lines from the goal-kick and connect to Mesut Ozil, like we did with the first goal.\n\n\u201cWe have young players, we are working to improve and they will gain experience from matches like today. We can grow up and learn with these mistakes. We knew that 2-0 was not enough at half time.\u201d", "description": "Granit Xhaka admits Arsenal\u00a0were \u2018scared\u2019 and lacked \u2018character\u2019 after collapsing\u00a0to draw 2-2 against Watford.\u00a0 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had given the Gunners a 2-0 lead at Vicarage Road.\u00a0 But after Sokratis Papastathopoulos gifted Tom Cleverley a goal to halve the deficit, David Luiz hacked down Roberto Pereyra.", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/19/Xhaka-claims-Arsenal-were-scared.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
