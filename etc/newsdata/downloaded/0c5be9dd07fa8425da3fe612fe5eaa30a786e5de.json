The right to cross-examine other witnesses is necessary. The right to have counsel is necessary. The right to participate fully in the process is necessary.\u201d\n\nHe went on to declare this impeachment process, which differs from that of former Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, the evisceration of the system of law by House Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey used to talk about Russia for two and a half years,\u201d Levin added. \u201cThey used to talk about the Mueller report. They used to talk about volume 2 of the Mueller report. They used to demand grand jury information. They have failed on every single front. So now it\u2019s Ukraine, and they don\u2019t intend to fail this time, you see. Because they are going to violate \u2014 violate \u2014 the procedures that have been in place in the House of Representatives for Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton. It is they who are eviscerating our system of law. It is they who need to be held to account.\u201d\n\n(h/t CR)\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "Wednesday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Mark Levin, author of \"Unfreedom of the Press,\" criticized the process by which House Democrats are pursuing impeachment against President Donald Trump. | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Levin924-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
