He is hosting huge rallies, with massive attendance (far more than the numbers the Dems have been able to put up collectively.) He\u2019s also holding these rallies mostly in toss-up, rust-belt, and swing states where he has a shot to increase his numbers in 2020.\n\nBut even if we assume the obvious\u2014that after a tough and bitter battle with \u201cwhoever\u201d gets the nod from the Democrats\u2014President Trump wins and probably by a wide margin, what the Dems are doing is still reckless and dangerous.\n\nHere\u2019s but a few reasons:\n\n1. They\u2019ve moved to new targets. Like it or not the new (albeit ignorant) standard for the Democratic Party is the giving away of everything. Gone is any semblance of the JFK Democrat who echoed his words, \u201cask not what your country can do for you but rather what you can do for your country!\u201d When Bernie preaches free college, Warren adds free health care, Kamala adds free needles, Biden promises no jail for non-violent crimes, and Yang is literally promising cash from the treasury, there is a conditioning occurring \u2014 my government owes me stuff.\n\n2. They\u2019ve assumed new powers. When they openly pledge to violate the constitution and through literal threat of seizure announce that they are ignoring the foundational law and the second oldest of the Constitutional amendments, how long does it take before they decide to do the same with First Amendment protections? When the governing class decides to ignore a portion of their lawful constraint and accountability one can pretty much bank on none of the lawful constraints that they are meant to operate under will be observed.\n\n3. They\u2019ve sunk to new lows. When one of the candidates looks into a camera and proclaims the United States to be plagued with \u201csystemic racism\u201d you know they are lying. But when the entire group does it\u2014hundreds of times in three hours\u2014it takes on a perverse sense of strategy. Slavery existed in some form in nearly every society on the planet until the primarily European and American abolitionist movements that began world wide change. Nations in Central and South America continued to practice race-based slavery after America declared it illegal. In India, portions of Southwest Asia, and Africa\u2014to this day\u2014slavery based on ethnic and religious prejudice continues to be perpetrated. In America you have individuals who have made it to the top of every industry of every race and background. We are the least racist nation on the planet. Yet the Democratic candidates are willing to slander their fellow countrymen, if it will help them turn out 15 percent more votes in heavily Democratic districts where these lies are continually repeated.\n\nThe Democrats running for president are not serious people.\n\nTheir ideas are plagued by historical inaccuracy in their assumptions and claims. They believe in lying to everyone listening, promising things they can never deliver, at a cost to everyone far greater than they indicate, that will not accomplish what they purport they will.\n\nThe lack of seriousness is palpable. The damage they are doing to the future of our nation is very real though.\n\nIt\u2019s why we must expose the danger in their lies.\n\nThose who come behind us are counting on us.", "description": "One thing that is somewhat comforting this week is that .09/15/2019 10:20:58AM EST.", "authors": ["Kevin Mccullough", "Beth Baumann", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/1831f493-66c1-4e34-b590-75f29543808b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
