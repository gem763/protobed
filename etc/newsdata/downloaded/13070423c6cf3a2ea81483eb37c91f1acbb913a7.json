Here are 25 of the beloved sitcom\u2019s most memorable quotes.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nFrom left, Matt LeBlanc, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer in \u201cThe One With The Rumor,\u201d a Season 8 episode of \u201cFriends.\u201d (PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n\u201cFriends\u201d is officially 25, which means it\u2019s time for a super low-key birthday celebration with its dearest pals \u2014 a group that exceeded 52 million when the sitcom aired its final episode in 2004.\n\nThe Internet has talked, at great length, about what made the show special (in addition to the ways it hasn\u2019t aged so well). But there\u2019s no denying \u201cFriends\u201d made an indelible mark on our culture \u2014 and has continued to do so for new generations discovering the show on streaming networks or in syndication.\n\nIn celebration of the show\u2019s quarter-century milestone, we\u2019ve put together a list of some of the most memorable quotes from Monica (Courteney Cox), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Ross (David Schwimmer), Joey (Matt LeBlanc), Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow).\n\n1. \u201cWell, maybe I don\u2019t need your money. Wait, wait, I said maybe!\u201d\n\nBy the time \u201cFriends\u201d ended, Rachel had forged a successful career in fashion. But when we first meet her in the show\u2019s pilot, she is heavily dependent on her wealthy father, who disagrees with his daughter\u2019s decision to leave her orthodontist fiance at the altar. This line was part of the conversation that led Rachel to move in with Monica, giving way to one of TV\u2019s most iconic friend groups.\n\n2. \u201cWe were on a break!\u201d\n\nWho could forget this gem \u2014 used repeatedly by Ross \u2014 to justify sleeping with someone other than his longtime love, Rachel, after she suggested they take a break (but not break up, duh).\n\n3. \u201cSee? He\u2019s her lobster.\u201d\n\nPhoebe always knew Ross and Rachel were meant to be together.\n\n4. \u201cJoey doesn\u2019t share food!\u201d\n\nAfter a date deigned to eat two of his french fries, Joey revealed his biggest dealbreaker.\n\n5. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Chandler. I make jokes when I\u2019m uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nCould this Chandler Bing quote be any more on the nose?\n\n6. \u201cI wish I could, but I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nPhoebe established early on that she had no qualms about saying no to favors such as helping put together furniture.\n\n7. \u201cSeven!\u201d\n\nMonica was intense about pretty much everything \u2014 even an impromptu tutorial on erogenous zones.\n\n8. \u201cPivot!\u201d\n\nRoss, meanwhile, was intense about moving furniture. And he over-pronounced \u201cpivot.\u201d If you haven\u2019t said this at least once while moving, we\u2019ll assume you haven\u2019t watched many \u201cFriends\u201d episodes. Or you, understandably, find Monica\u2019s brother annoying.\n\n9. \u201cCould I be wearing any more clothes?\u201d\n\nRemember when Joey expertly trolled Chandler, his sweatpants and his singular approach to intonation?\n\n10. \u201cIt tastes like feet!\u201d\n\nAt least Ross gave an honest review of Rachel\u2019s abominable Thanksgiving trifle.\n\n11. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like? Custard: good. Jam: good. Meat: good!\u201d\n\nWe can also appreciate this equally honest review from Joey.\n\n12. \u201cThis is all a moo point.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like a cow\u2019s opinion, according to Joey, who also says \u201csupposably.\u201d\n\n13. \u201cYour little Harmonica is hammered.\u201d\n\nRemember \u201cThe One Where They All Turn Thirty,\u201d when Monica figured it was time to come clean to her parents about her rebellious behavior?\n\n14. \u201cCan\u2019t hold her own head up, but yeah \u2014 jumped.\u201d\n\nRoss teasing Rachel for panicking while their infant daughter was (accidentally) locked inside their appointment is peak Ross.\n\n15. \u201cAnd I have to live with a boy!\u201d\n\nPoor cohabitating Monica.\n\n16. \u201cHow you doin'?\u201d\n\nThis list would not be complete without Joey\u2019s signature catchphrase.\n\n17. \u201cOh. My. God.\u201d\n\nOr the uniquely uttered catchphrase of Chandler\u2019s ex-girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler).\n\n18. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a \u2018pla.\u2019 \u201d\n\nYou may not remember that Phoebe said this during an episode that featured a George Stephanopoulos subplot, but true \u201cFriends\u201d fans will always remember this example of Phoebe\u2019s blatant and what would today be meme-worthy honesty \u2014 in response to a question about whether she had a plan.\n\n19. \u201cOkay, you have to stop the Q-Tip when there\u2019s resistance.\u201d\n\nChandler cut us (and an especially garrulous Joey) deep with this biting remark, which Perry cited as his favorite one-liner from his 10 seasons on the show in a \u201cGood Morning America\u201d interview.\n\n20. \u201cOh, come on Will, just take off your shirt and tell us.\u201d\n\nWhen Brad Pitt guest-starred as Will, the nemesis of the character played by his then-wife, Aniston, Phoebe was her typically forward self.\n\n21. \u201cNestl\u00e9 Toulouse.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll never bake Nestl\u00e9 Toll House cookies without thinking about Phoebe and her French grandmother, whose French name we \u201cAmericans always butcher.\u201d\n\n22. \u201cThey don\u2019t know that we know they know we know.\u201d\n\nWhen Phoebe and Joey found out Monica and Chandler were secretly dating, things got kind of complicated.\n\n23. \u201cYou can\u2019t just give up. Is that what a dinosaur would do?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Joey actually understood what Ross did for a living.\n\n24. \u201cCome on, Ross, you\u2019re a paleontologist. Dig a little deeper.\u201d\n\nIf ever there were a roast of Ross Geller, Phoebe would be the obvious host.\n\n25. \u201cI got off the plane.\u201d\n\nAs in the show\u2019s pilot, Rachel made a pivotal (hi, Ross!) decision in the series finale: She got off the plane.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe \u2018Downton Abbey\u2019 cast wants to take you back to a more innocent time \u2014 2012\n\nTaylor & Kanye: How two superstars, four words and 15 seconds of TV influenced a decade of pop culture", "description": "We still use these lines from Rachel, Monica, Joey, Chandler, Phoebe and Ross.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "September At Am", "Bethonie Butler Writes About Television", "Pop Culture For The Washington Post.
