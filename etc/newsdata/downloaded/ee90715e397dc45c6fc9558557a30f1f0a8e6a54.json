All assailed Trump without mercy.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker called Trump a racist. Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke called him a white supremacist. And Kamala Harris, a California senator, said Trump\u2019s hateful social media messages provided \u201cthe ammunition\u201d for recent mass shootings.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, you have spent the last two-and-a-half years full time trying to sow hate and vision among us, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve gotten nothing done,\u201d Harris declared.\n\nThe Democrats primary contest has been remarkably stable, but the debate comes at a pivotal point in the campaign as more voters move past their summer vacations and begin to pay closer attention to politics.\n\nPolls show that a strong majority of all voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction under the first-term president\u2019s leadership. But nine months into their nomination fight, divided Democrats have yet to answer fundamental questions about who or what the party stands for beyond simply opposing Trump.\n\nThe debate is shaped by evolving issues of race, gender, generation and ideology that again exploded into public view on the debate stage Thursday night.\n\nObama himself emerged as a hot point as the discussion shifted to health care and immigration in particular.\n\nSanders said Biden, Obama\u2019s two-term vice president, bears responsibility for millions of Americans going bankrupt under the \u201cObamacare\u201d health care system.\n\nBiden slapped back at both Sanders and Warren and contended they haven\u2019t yet explained how they would pay for Sanders\u2019 government-backed \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care plan.\n\nCastro, who served as Obama\u2019s housing chief, kept the pressure on the front-runner.\n\nThe 44-year-old Texan appeared to touch on concerns about Biden\u2019s age when he accused the former vice president of forgetting a detail about his own health care plan. At 76, Biden would be the oldest president ever elected to a first term.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro asked. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that you have to buy in and now you\u2019re forgetting that.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nThe ABC News debate was the first limited to one night after several candidates dropped out and others failed to meet new qualification standards. A handful more candidates qualified for next month\u2019s debate, which will again be divided over two nights.\n\nBesides the infighting, viewers saw the diversity of the modern Democratic Party.\n\nThe debate, held on the campus of historically black Texas Southern University, includes women, people of color and a gay man, a striking contrast to the Republicans. It unfolded in a rapidly changing state that Democrats hope to eventually bring into their column.\n\nThe debate shifted to gun violence in a state shaken by a mass shooting last month that left 22 people dead and two dozen more wounded.\n\nIn an emotional moment, O\u2019Rourke said that there weren\u2019t enough ambulances at times to take all the wounded to the hospital.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said, as the crowd cheered.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar noted that all the candidates on stage favor a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. She favors a voluntary buy-back program on assault weapons, however.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump noted he\u2019d be in Baltimore at a Republican retreat during the debate and wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d get a chance to watch. But he predicted the Democratic nominee would ultimately be Biden, Warren or Sanders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very interesting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to watch it as a re-run.\u201d\n\nThe leading Democratic candidates may not have another chance to face off for quite some time.\n\nThe Democratic field may be divided into two groups when they meet in October because more than 10 candidates qualified for the next round.\n\n___\n\nPeoples reported from Washington.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The three leading Democratic presidential candidates clashed over health care, immigration and President Barack Obama's legacy on Thursday in a fierce debate that pitted an aggressive Joe Biden against liberal rivals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bill Barrow", "Steve Peoples"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/election_2020_debate_63790_c0-158-3794-2370_s1770x1032.jpg?23d59563da3935a99902906cfcb30551535e07c4", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
