War against Islamic State ended two years ago and the oil-rich country has seen an unprecedented level of security.\n\nA demonstrator gestures as he stands close to burning tires blocking a road, during a protest over unemployment, corruption and poor public services, in Baghdad, Iraq October 2, 2019. REUTERS/Khalid al-Mousily\n\nBut corruption and economic mismanagement have worsened conditions even further for many, leading to a new round of unrest and anger at a government that has been in power almost a year.\n\nProtesters took to the streets in their thousands on Tuesday chanting against graft and demanding jobs and services. Security forces opened fire. Two people died, and scores including police were injured. Protests re-ignited on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe people want the fall of the regime\u201d - a slogan often reserved for specific leaders in the Arab world - were in Iraq directed at an entire political class and system.\n\nDemonstrators say the ruling establishment has fuelled endemic corruption and kept millions of people living in poverty despite the OPEC member\u2019s vast oil wealth.\n\n\u201cBaghdad\u2019s renewed protests and the violent reaction by security forces is a sign that people are rejecting the political establishment for failing to improve lives despite a huge national budget,\u201d said economic lecturer Ahmed al-Mumin.\n\nIn Iraq\u2019s 2019 budget, nearly 19% of more than $106 billion is spent on security alone while the oil ministry gets 14%. The education, reconstruction and health sectors receive around 8% between them.\n\nMost protesters were young men seeking jobs and services promised for years by successive governments, Mumin said.\n\nIraq still suffers from a chronic lack of job opportunities, power and water supply and other basic services two years after the war against the hardline Islamic State (IS) ended.\n\nIraqis hoped better security would offer the respite needed to fix infrastructure. Roads, hospitals, schools and much else were hurt by years of war and neglect, including U.N. sanctions, a U.S.-led invasion and toppling of dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003, civil war and most recently the fight against IS.\n\nInstead, they say it is getting worse - mainly because of corruption.\n\n\u201cJobs are available only to those with links to militias and powerful religious political parties,\u201d said Salam Jaafar, 30, a graduate from a technical institution and father of three.\n\nUnemployment stood at 13% with youth unemployment at 25.6% in 2017, according to International Labour Organization data. A survey by the National Democratic Institute in July said a large majority of Iraqis see corruption as worsening in recent years.\n\nPOWERFUL PARTIES, WEAK GOVERNMENT\n\nMany like Jaafar blame the parties that control Iraq\u2019s parliament and government, which include factions linked to powerful Iran-backed paramilitary groups.\n\nTheir image as heroes who had an important role in defeating IS has in some cases been sullied by accusations of sleaze and control of parts of the economy. The groups deny this.\n\nThe government has set aside 2% of the 2019 budget to pay its paramilitaries, which are now formally part of the state.\n\nThe most powerful armed groups on the ground are represented by a large group of lawmakers. A self-styled populist bloc led by cleric Moqtada al-Sadr also controls a large number of seats.\n\nIraq\u2019s political system divides up cabinet seats among the most powerful parties, who competed for months to form a government before picking the independent Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi last year.\n\nAnalysts say Abdul Mahdi is beholden to the often clashing interests of those parties and so unable to enact real reform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a failure of vision... the protests yesterday really just showed how lacking in ideas or any alternative vision or any political programme all the political classes are,\u201d said Fanar Haddad, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Middle East Institute.\n\nMany Iraqis despise politicians and governing institutions. Lawmakers spend large stretches of time abroad and are unavailable to constituents when parliament is not in session.\n\nThey accuse them of awarding jobs and contracts to their parties or kin and controlling ministries for their own gain.\n\nPoliticians say Iraq needs an extended period of stability and calm for reform to take root. They argue Iraq\u2019s internal security is held to ransom by bigger powers like the United States and Iran, which are engaged in a destabilising regional showdown over sanctions and influence.\n\nBut many say that with Iraq\u2019s vast resources - it possesses the world\u2019s fourth-largest oil reserves according to the International Monetary Fund - its citizens should prosper.\n\nThe IMF in a recent report said the conflict with IS had caused some $46 billion of damage to infrastructure and property. But it added that \u201cweak governance and corruption are widely acknowledged as parts of the problem.\u201d\n\nREGIONAL INSTABILITY\n\nAbdul Mahdi\u2019s government is also trying to avoid being bruised by the strains between the United States and Iran.\n\nIraq, which hosts both U.S. troops and Iran-backed paramilitary groups, often in close proximity, is desperate to avoid being stuck in the middle of a regional conflagration.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThis summer rocket attacks which Washington blamed on Iran-backed groups hit near U.S. forces, and alleged Israeli air strikes hit Shi\u2019ite Muslim militia groups.\n\n\u201cThe Iran-U.S. crisis has pressured Abdul Mahdi\u2019s government and distracted his efforts to handle key issues such as fixing the war-hit economy,\u201d Baghdad-based analyst Ahmed Younis said.\n\n\u201cBut worrying about keeping Iraq away from the regional conflict more than fixing a poor domestic economy is a fatal mistake that could have dire consequences. Mishandling protests could create a real crisis for him.\u201d", "description": "Fed up of waiting for a peace dividend, Iraqis feel their country should be well on the road to recovery by now.
