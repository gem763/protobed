We've got belief in each other and in the squad.'\n\nWales might have beaten France in seven of their last eight meetings since the 2011 World Cup semi-final - only losing the infamous 100-minute Six Nations match by two points in 2017 - but they are wary of their rivals.\n\nOnly eight months ago Les Bleus were 16-0 up at half-time against Wales in Paris, before they collapsed to lose 24-19.\n\nWales recovered from 16-0 down to beat France in their Six Nations clash in February\n\n'France are renowned for being able to turn it on and when they do they're extremely dangerous.,' said Adams.\n\n'They've got some quality players. At times in this competition they've looked really, really good.\n\n'They definitely pose a threat to us without a doubt.'\n\nYoung fly-half Romain Ntamack is confident that France will show their mental fortitude\n\nFrance fly-half Romain Ntamack is determined to prove they are not flaky, though.\n\n'We start matches strongly, we have the opportunity to kill them off, but we don't and teams come back,' the 20-year-old said.\n\n'We hold back, our first-half success deserts us. We have to correct that and we'll correct it this weekend.\n\n'We had a great first half (in the Six Nations match). We put Wales in trouble.\n\n'We have to take that as our working base.\n\n'The goal is to make the same start, last 80 minutes, and if we have the chance, kill off the match.'\n\nWhile Wales have just a week between matches, France will not have played for a fortnight when the quarter-final in Oita is played on Sunday after their England match was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nBut Adams said he prefers to be battle-hardened having started all four the the Pool games.\n\n'Personally playing, in a funny way, does keep me rugby tough,' the winger said.\n\n'That's helped me.'", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN BEPPU: The World Cup's\u00a0top try-scorer, Wales' Josh Adams, is in record-hunting mood having fired his side into the quarter-finals.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/19/19706368-0-image-a-10_1571079561018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
