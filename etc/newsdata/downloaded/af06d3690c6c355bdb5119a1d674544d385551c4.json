A seemingly broken play after the half-time siren turned into a move the Harlem Globetrotters would have been proud of as a flurry of flick passes and offloads ended in the hands of Jennings who found his nuggety hooker with an inch-perfect grubber to make it 12-0.\n\nLions coach Wayne Bennett would have been desperate to see a response from his side after they were totally outplayed in the opening 40 minutes, and the signs were promising when Oliver Gildart went close to start the second half.\n\nBut errors and ill-discipline cruelled their chances, and it was fitting that a piece of foul play pushed the margin out to 14 points when Siosiua Taukeiaho slotted a simple penalty goal with 16 minutes remaining.\n\nThe scene was set for the visitors' star-studded spine to spark somewhat of a comeback but instead it was left to Canberra star John Bateman who slid over late to get his side on the board with a try that proved little more than a consolation.", "description": "The Tonga Invitational XIII put off-field dramas aside to stun Great Britain 14-6 in Hamilton in a frightening display of physicality and flair ahead of...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
