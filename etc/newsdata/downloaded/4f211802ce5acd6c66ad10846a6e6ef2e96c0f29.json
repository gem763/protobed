Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stood her ground on her plan for a wealth tax on Tuesday, saying that billionaires should be able to pitch in 2 cents \u201cso every other kid in America has a chance to make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I think this is about our values as a country. Show me your tax plans, and we\u2019ll know what your values are,\u201d she said at the Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nThe candidates were asked about supporting a wealth tax on billionaires, a plan that only Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have proposed and openly advocated for. Warren\u2019s plan would impose a 2% tax on households with net worths of more than $50 million, with an additional 1% on wealth above $1 billion.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator claims the tax plan would cover universal child care, universal pre-kindergarten, billions in funding for historically black colleges and better teacher pay. But more moderate Democrats have shied away from the proposal, fearing it wouldn\u2019t win them the election.\n\n\u201cMy question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s why does everyone else on this stage think it\u2019s more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren on closing the income gap: \"My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax, it's why does everyone else on the stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/XHQV586X4W \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), a moderate Democrat, used Warren\u2019s answer to go after the candidate, who is currently one of the party\u2019s front-runners and surging in polls. Klobuchar has not yet reached the polling threshold to qualify for the fifth Democratic debate in November.\n\n\u201cI want to give a reality check to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,\u201d Klobuchar said, referring to billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, who made his first appearance on a debate stage Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump,\u201d the Minnesota senator added, hinting that Warren\u2019s approach will not help Democrats beat the president.\n\n\"I want to give a reality check to Elizabeth [Warren], because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires.

Amy Klobuchar on Warren's support for a wealth tax #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/7vxVy16IM0 \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 16, 2019\n\nWarren responded by defending being more radical in her ideas and explaining that a wealth tax would yield more than an income tax.\n\n\u201cThe rich are not like you and me,\u201d Warren told Klobuchar. \u201cThe really, really billionaires are making money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation.\n\n\u201cI understand that this is hard,\u201d Warren continued. \u201cBut I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard. Not when we dream small and quit before we get started.\u201d", "description": "The Massachusetts senator criticized other Democrats at the debate for not hitting billionaires hard enough to help fix income inequality.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da677c4210000570fad26f3.jpeg?cache=iggpsbhll9&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
