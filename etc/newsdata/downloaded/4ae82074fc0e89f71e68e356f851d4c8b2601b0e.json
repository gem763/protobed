A 15-year-old died protecting his little sister, police say.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cA violent encounter had ensued, and the teenager succumbed to [his] injuries,\u201d Charlotte County Sheriff Bill Prummell said at a news conference last week. \u201cThis has been a very tough scene to deal with. It was a senseless crime.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe grisly episode has rocked the harbor town of nearly 55,000 people on southwest Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast, where friends, classmates and family members are now remembering the high school sophomore as a hero. More than 100 people attended a candlelight vigil on Sunday, singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d as they sent sky lanterns into the air.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA piece of my heart will forever be missing!!\u201d his mother wrote on Facebook. And on a GoFundMe page, she said, \u201cMy son had a long life ahead of him, that was taken too soon.\u201d Neither she nor her daughter have been identified publicly, and police said Edman\u2019s family has asked for privacy.\n\nBut Crystal Stone, who is representing Edman\u2019s family, said that the circumstances of the teenager\u2019s death has revealed his true character.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is no hero that can amount to Khyler,\u201d Stone told WINK. \u201cHe loved his family. He was his sister\u2019s keeper.\u201d\n\nAt around 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, police said they received several 911 calls about burglaries and an \u201cinjured white male,\u201d who appeared to have been stabbed and was acting strangely near Port Charlotte\u2019s Augusta Avenue. The man, later identified by authorities as 27-year-old Ryan Clayton Cole, had raised suspicions while walking around the mostly residential area, lined with shrubs and palm trees near a canal.\n\nAD\n\nAs police responded to the scene, Cole began sprinting away from them and ducked behind a home two streets down.\n\nNeighbor Chris Hinrichs told the Port Charlotte Sun he saw the suspect on his patio, soaking wet as blood poured out of his right hand and onto his arm. The man was kneeling down, trying to put on a child-sized boxing glove that had come from inside Hinrich\u2019s house.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe looked like he was in a hurry,\u201d Cole told the newspaper. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really look too with it.\u201d\n\nAs Hinrichs approached the man, he yelled, \u201cWhat are you doing in my house? I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d\n\nThe suspect answered with only two words: \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut Hinrichs called 911 about the invader anyway. Officers were able to chase down Cole and arrest him 15 minutes later, they said, before taking him to the hospital for his wounds, which police described as stabbing injuries without specifying where they came from.\n\nAD\n\nA police search around the Port Charlotte neighborhood following the arrest led them to the house on Starlite Lane, where they found the uninjured 5-year-old and Edman\u2019s body. Police said he died from injuries incurred in the \u201cviolent encounter,\u201d but did not say exactly what they were.\n\nAD\n\nCole, who is being held without bond for violating parole, was no stranger to local law enforcement, Prummell said. He has a history of drug abuse and had been arrested over 20 times, according to jail records from the Charlotte County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nBefore filing charges related to Edman\u2019s death, Prummell said, the office is working with the state attorney\u2019s office. That agency told CNN that Cole, who made his first appearance in court on Tuesday, has not yet been assigned a lawyer.\n\nThe teenager\u2019s death has shocked the community, located about 100 miles south of Tampa. On Monday, students at Port Charlotte High School held a moment of silence and wore blue in Edman\u2019s honor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe it when I first heard about it, I really didn\u2019t,\u201d his classmate, Sioux Anderson, told WBBH. \u201cWhen he protected his sister he became a man that day, not a lot of people would do that.\u201d\n\nA member of the Junior Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps at his high school, Edman loved the outdoors, the Florida Gators and trips to play with bumper cars at a nearby amusement park, his obituary said.\n\nMike Riley, a spokesperson for Charlotte County Public Schools, told CNN that the teenager, who took some honors classes, \u201claid his life down to save his baby sister and showed his community how much of a hero he was.\u201d\n\nAs of early Wednesday, a GoFundMe created by Stone to raise funeral expenses for the family had raised more than $70,000. Edman\u2019s classmates have also been selling decals to raise money, WINK reported, and Stone said any additional expenses would go toward relocating the family to a new house.\n\nLike a neighbor who lives across the street, Stone questioned why Cole was out on probation after so many arrests. Edman\u2019s family is now pushing for a proposal they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cKhyler\u2019s Law\u201d to toughen sentences for repeat offenders.\n\nWhat the family wants to focus on, she told WINK, is \u201cgetting Khyler the justice that he deserves.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Students at local schools wore blue on Monday in honor of Khyler Edman, 15, who died from injuries related to the attack.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kdmhKU0Odh-B9IoLd9D8FsHrKMs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SFV3LEJXSFCJTHWZC7BD6KE5M4.png"}
