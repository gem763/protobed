He said: 'All of Italian football joins the family's condolences for the death of Giorgio Squinzi.\n\n'The many sincere messages inspired by his memory... they bear witness to how the Sassuolo patron was appreciated and respected for his human qualities even more than his professional capacity.'\n\nAcross Italian football there have been endless tributes, while UEFA once singled out Sassuolo as a model club for progression and Squinzi for his successful ownership.\n\nDuring a colourful 17 years at the helm, he took Sassuolo from Serie C2 to Serie A, transformed the fortunes of a town and earned legendary status during a journey that was not without plenty of success and controversy.\n\nSassuolo fan Fracesco Morini told Sportsmail: 'He invested a lot in the team without expecting anything: he just loved soccer in its pure form. He will be remembered very fondly by fans.'\n\nEvery club in Serie A held a minute's silence as tribute to Squinzi after his death\n\nSquinzi was also sure to enjoy all the moments that success brought him and his club.\n\nA boyhood fan of AC Milan, Squinzi entered into a bet with his friend Remo Morini ahead of the team's first-ever Serie A encounter with rivals Inter Milan in 2013.\n\nShould Sassuolo do the improbable and win, Morini would gift Squinzi a trophy.\n\nSince that first Serie A match in 2013, Sassuolo have beaten Inter Milan seven times, and seven trophies now adorn Squinzi's office.\n\nIn a poignant twist, Sassuolo's first match after Squinzi's death is against Inter Milan.\n\nMinnows Sassuolo have won seven matches against Inter Milan since reaching Serie A\n\nSquinzi was initially better known for his investments in cycling, running the very successful Mapei professional team until 2002, when his attentions turned to football.\n\nBefore Squinzi took charge, UC Sassuolo Calcio, founded in 1920, had spent much of its existence in the regional leagues before finally rising to Serie D in 1968.\n\nA first taste of Serie C2 football came in 1984, but six years later they were demoted again before climbing back in 1998.\n\nSquinzi's arrival four years later did not bring instant success.\n\nIt was not until 2006 that they earned a first promotion, via the play-offs, to begin the long climb up the leagues.\n\nMassimilliano Allegri was boss of Sassuolo before achieving great success at Juventus\n\nSquinzi and his advisers possessed a sharp eye for emerging managers - during one season at Sassuolo in 2007-08, future five-time Scudetto winner Massimiliano Allegri led the club to an unlikely Serie C1 triumph and into Serie B for the first time.\n\nAfter a difficult spell at struggling Lecce, Eusebio Di Francesco would be given a second chance by Squinzi in Serie B in 2012.\n\nNeeding a win against Livorno to seal promotion on the final day of the season, Simone Missiroli sparked pandemonium and ensured Serie A football for the first time ever with a last-minute winner.\n\nSquinzi showed all sides of his character in 2014, briefly sacking Eusebio after a string of defeats.\n\nHowever, the owner failed to lure Filipo Inzhagi to the club and turned to Alberto Malesani. He managed five games and no wins before departing and back came Di Francesco.\n\nHaving ensured survival with a 17th-place finish, Di Francesco was not done there, helping the club to 12th and, in 2016, a sixth place that saw his side Europa League football for the first time ever.\n\nFittingly, they announced themselves with a 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao - the highlight of a group stage exit.\n\nDomenico Berardi has played for Suassuolo since the age of 16 and is already a club legend\n\nUnderpinning all this was shrewd investment and faith in home-grown Italians, even at the highest level.\n\nMatteo Politano was signed in 2015 and now plays for Inter Milan and the Italian national side. Sime Vrsaljko is now at Inter Milan via Atletico Madrid.\n\nThe crown jewel, of course, is Domenico Berardi. At the club since the age of 16, he made his debut aged 18 in the Serie B promotion-winning season. Having spurned interest from Juventus, he has five senior Italy caps and 234 club appearances at 25, the second-highest in Sassuolo history.\n\nThe highest, with 439, is Francesco Magnanelli, the last-surviving veteran of every promotion under Squinzi. Now 34 and in his 13th season at the club, Magnanelli has played in every division plus the Europa League.\n\nIn Sassuolo's matchday programme before facing Inter Milan, Magnanelli paid tribute to the president: 'A far-sighted president, a president who saw beyond the single match and who tried to build the swing of something bigger and lasted over time.'\n\nFrancesco Magnanelli (left) has been a Sassuolo player for 13 years and risen up the divisions\n\nKeen to progress the club, Squinzi purchased the rights to the 21,584-capacity Stadio Citta del Tricolore in Reggio Emilia - renaming it Mapei Stadium - in an auction in 2013 and moved Sassuolo there.\n\nIn doing so, Squinzi ensured his club were the first of three in Serie A - alongside Juventus and Udinese - to own their own stadium, even if it was outside of Sassuolo's city limits.\n\nThat, however, did not please the club's small but vocal Curva Nord ultras, who said at the time: 'How many times have we reaffirmed our sense of belonging and love for our city, and how important it is not to constantly feel like guests; but unfortunately economic interests have prevailed over the passion and attachment to our colours\u2026 One more time, we do not belong in this stadium.'\n\nHowever, Squinzi persevered and the club introduced an innovative approach to ticketing, with 23 executive boxes available, that has helped the club generate consistent matchday income.\n\nSuch was his sense of philanthropy he allowed local side and previous owners Reggiana - a former Serie A side that went bust and reformed in Serie C in 2018 - to play there.\n\nFans do, however, maintain deep affection for Squinzi.\n\nMorini said: 'With Sassuolo he saw the chance of creating a really good team also for young players.\n\n'This is the main reason everyone loved him, because for him soccer was first of all entertainment and sport, business was always coming last.'\n\nDespite the minor discontent, such foresight and prudence was a hallmark of Squinzi's patronage. A \u20ac22million sponsorship deal with his own firm Mapei - the most lucrative in Serie A - ensured the club had the resources to be competitive at the top level.\n\nWhen promotion to Serie A was sealed in 2013, Squinzi was swift to deliver the necessary upgrades \u2013 new scoreboards, fresh turf and renovated seating were introduced to ensure the club lived up to their new surroundings.\n\nIn an age of unpredictable owners leading clubs to ruin in pursuit of glory, Squinzi stands almost alone as a president who has brought untold success and stability to a true minnow.\n\nHis side now have one last chance to say a fitting goodbye.", "description": "Standing on the banks of the River Secchia, a short drive from Modena in the Emilia Romagna region and boasting a population of little more than 40,000, Sassuolo had little Sporting heritage.", "authors": ["James Ayles For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19658860-0-image-a-39_1570980567265.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
