It has already been approved by the upper house.\n\nThe law makes it legal for terminations to be conducted up to 22 weeks into a woman's pregnancy - or later if two doctors agree.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The debate over the bill prompted protests on both sides\n\nThe reform had been strongly opposed by some activists and several MPs who raised objections due to their personal beliefs, as well as concerns about late-term abortions.", "description": "New South Wales becomes the final state to overturn laws which had been criticised as archaic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1794A/production/_108968569_gettyimages-1169035786.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
