It's incredible nobody was killed. Or hurt. We had nobody even hurt,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's why the dog was so great.\"\n\nThe dog, a Belgian Malinois, was sent into a tunnel to subdue al-Baghdadi during the early-morning raid on a compound in Syria. Al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three children and wounding the dog.\n\nWe have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi! pic.twitter.com/PDMx9nZWvw \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2019\n\nEarlier in the day, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, said the name of the dog \u2014 who appears to be a very good boy or girl \u2014 remained classified.\n\n\"We're not releasing the name of the dog right now. The dog is still in theater. The dog, the canine, the military working dog, performed a tremendous service, as they all do in a variety of situations. Slightly wounded and fully recovering. But the dog is still in theater, returned to duty with its handlers,\" Milley said. \"We're protecting the dog's identity.\"\n\nBelgian Malinois are known for their work ethic and intelligence and widely used by the military and law enforcement. A Malinois named Cairo famously accompanied U.S. commandos on the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nFin Gomez contributed reporting.", "description": "The dog, a Belgian Malinois, was sent into a tunnel to subdue the ISIS leader during the early-morning raid on a compound in Syria", "authors": ["Stefan Becket"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/28/d9ac7eec-f598-4352-b635-b87e09b40f6b/thumbnail/1200x630g2/86ea6a74b0350f292f2847f246828969/belgian-malinois.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
