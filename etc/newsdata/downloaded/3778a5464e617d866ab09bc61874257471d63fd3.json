Photo: Neon\n\nWarning: some mild spoilers ahead.\n\nParasite\u2019s description seems simple enough: A poor family schemes their way into a wealthy family\u2019s employ \u2014 the summer of scam returns! When we meet the poor family (the Kims), they\u2019re living in a below-street-level apartment where they crawl onto elevated toilets to mooch Wi-Fi from their neighbors. Meanwhile, the wealthy family (the Parks) are living in a modernist mansion that\u2019s the finest real estate I\u2019ve seen this side of Big Little Lies. One by one, the Kims, pretending not to know each other, manage to get hired into service at the Park mansion: as tutors for their children, as a housekeeper, as a driver. It seems obvious that the Kims are leeching off the Parks. (\u201cIf you put our salaries together,\u201d Ki-taek observes one night, \u201cthe amount of money coming from that family into ours is immense.\u201d) But Parasite\u2019s worldview isn\u2019t so simple as to cast one family evil and the other heroic. Director Bong Joon-ho described it as \u201ca comedy without clowns and a tragedy without villains.\u201d Together, the families form a twisted, brilliant octet, and that\u2019s before we get to what\u2019s going on behind certain closed doors.\n\nBut we are gathered here today not to talk about those doors, but to talk about peaches. Because I promise that after Parasite, which screened this week as part of the Toronto International Film Festival, you will not look at them the same way again.\n\nIt all starts with the Kim kids \u2014 who go by Kevin and Jessica in the Park household and get hired first \u2014 as the aforementioned tutors to a daughter and son, respectively. To get their dad on payroll, they plant a pair of panties in the backseat of Mr. Park\u2019s car, framing the family driver and ensuring their father is pulled in as his replacement. Then they set their sights on Park\u2019s longtime housekeeper, Moon-kwang. She\u2019s older, not exactly warm, and a little suspicious of the new staff and how quickly they\u2019ve infiltrated her home. Soon enough, the Kims discover something about her they can exploit: her very serious peach allergy. It\u2019s not a tickle-in-your-throat allergy or something that can be staved off with a few pills \u2014 her peach allergy is just as sickly hilarious as Will Smith\u2019s in Hitch. All it takes is a few little scrapes of peach fuzz for Moon-kwang to have to abandon the luxurious house (not so voluntarily) and its blue-blood residents.\n\nAnd so, upon watching Parasite, here is something I have become convinced of: It\u2019s not the Jennifers (Lawrence or Lopez) or the Chrises (Pine, Evans, Hemsworth, Meloni, or Messina) or the Hollywood Alans (Arkin or Alda, yes I am trying to make this a thing) \u2014 peaches have the best agent in Hollywood. They show up in everything, doing everything. I am so happy to report that peaches have continued to be employed as the chaos agent of contemporary cinema, or at least the last two-ish years of my movie-going life. They were penetrated (and, importantly, uneaten) in Call Me by Your Name; they\u2019re poisonous in Parasite; they even have a bit part on Succession, as the last name of the season\u2019s best new character, Cyd Peach!\n\nSure, pre-Parasite, peaches got a star-making role in Call Me by Your Name. Frustrated-in-love teen Elio Perlman plucks a peach as a summer afternoon snack, but begins stroking it affectionately, and one thing leads to another and \u2014 hmm, how to put this delicately? \u2014 fucks it. Enter his slightly older lover Oliver who, surprised and amused by Elio\u2019s action, dips a finger into the peach and tastes its remains. I\u2019m imagining the Call Me By Your Name scene as a real ingenue moment for peaches: Grapes and oranges always get to shine, but peaches were overlooked. Peaches were working day shifts at a caf\u00e9 and auditioning on afternoons off, like Emma Stone in La La Land. But then, in Call Me by Your Name, they\u2019re discovered! Huzzah, a new \u201cIt\u201d fruit arrives in Hollywood \u2014 suddenly they\u2019re booked and busy and also ignoring hundreds of emails just to check the Google Alert for their name, which previously only buzzed when James and the Giant Peach was added or removed from a streaming service.\n\nParasite, though, is the the star-making moment for this fruit. After Call Me by Your Name they were just on a Young Hollywood list, between an ex-Disney star and a YouTuber; now they\u2019re being approached at LAX arrivals by a TMZ reporter waiting for Bieber. The power peaches have: Apples are poisonous in every movie. That\u2019s not range! Bananas are always the butt of some sophomoric phallic gag. That\u2019s not depth! Avocados \u2014 which I will admit I did not realize qualified as fruit until this very moment \u2014 are the premier lazy person\u2019s signifier for millennial status. Cherries and lemons were each immortalized by separate Beyonc\u00e9 projects, so they\u2019re doing just fine.\n\nStrawberries, watermelon, grapefruit, and blackberries: You should all be calling peaches\u2019 agent. Cantaloupes can choke though, because I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m allergic.", "description": "Director Bong Joon-ho described \u2018Parasite\u2019 as \u201ca comedy without clowns and a tragedy without villains.\u201d I describe it as a star-solidifying moment for the peach fruit.", "authors": ["Hunter Harris"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-parasite.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
