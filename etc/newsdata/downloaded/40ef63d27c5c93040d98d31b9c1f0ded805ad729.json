Fourteen victims remain missing.\n\nInvestigators have yet to determine the cause of the fire. Authorities said Tuesday that there was no indication that an explosion had occurred. Passengers were unable to get out because both the main stairwell and escape hatch were likely blocked by fire. It is unclear whether passengers were actually asleep when they died, U.S. Coast Guard Captain Monica Rochester said.\n\nHere's what we know about how the tragedy unfolded:\n\nA fire overtook the Conception early Monday morning. The vessel was anchored off Santa Cruz Island. More\n\nSaturday, August 31 \u2014 Conception leaves Santa Barbara Harbor\n\n4 a.m. The boat \"Conception\" leaves Santa Barbara Harbor for a recreational scuba diving trip, going on to tour Santa Cruz Island\u2019s south side that afternoon. On board the vessel charted by Truth Aquatics are six crew members and 33 passengers.\n\n11 p.m. Conception stops for the night on the island\u2019s east side.\n\nSunday, September 1 \u2014 Conception continues island tour\n\nConception tours Santa Cruz Island\u2019s northwest side before looking for a place to dock for the night near the island.\n\nMonday, September 2 \u2014 A fire sinks Conception\n\n12:05 a.m. According to MarineTraffic.com, Conception's last recorded location was near Platts Harbor. Law enforcement later confirmed the boat docked 20 yards from the shore of Santa Cruz Island.\n\nAround 3 a.m. Asleep on another boat, the Grape Escape, Bob Hansen and his wife awoke to knocking on the side of their vessel. Five crew members had escaped in a dingy. In the distance, Hansen could see Conception fully ablaze.\n\n\"They were not just in shock but several were crying,\u2019\u2019 said Bob Hansen, 70. \u201cOne guy was in a tremendous amount of pain (with a broken leg). The captain was all shook up. Nothing can prepare you for that. For myself, it was like, \u2018I can\u2019t do anything here. I\u2019m freaking helpless.\u2019 It\u2019s like an airplane (crash). What are you going to do after it\u2019s already hit the ground?\u2019\u2019\n\nInstead of heading back toward the Conception, Hansen said the boat's captain suggested he contact the Coast Guard instead.\n\n3:15 a.m. A distress call is made to the Coast Guard. Authorities later said a call was made from the Conception and others from the Great Escape. In audio of a call on Broadcastify that authorities suggested may have been edited to combine multiple calls, only the Coast Guard dispatcher can be heard, not the responses.\n\nThe dispatcher asks if passengers are trapped and if there's an escape hatch.\n\n3:30 a.m. The Coast Guard arrives on scene and begins to fight the fire.\n\n7:20 a.m. Conception sinks in 64 feet of water off the coast of Santa Cruz Island.\n\n8:40 a.m. James Kohls arrives at the U.S. Coast Guard Station Channel Island, waiting to hear from his brother Mike, who he says is a cook and a deckhand on the Conception.\n\n\"I haven't heard from anybody,\" Kohls said.\n\n9 a.m. At a press conference, the Coast Guard says that 34 people are unaccounted for and that shoreline searches on the island are underway. The department also says that the five crew members were asleep on the top deck while passengers were asleep below deck.\n\n11:15 a.m. The Coast Guard announces that four bodies have been found near the Conception.\n\n4 p.m. At an afternoon press conference, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown says four more bodies have been found, increasing the death toll to eight victims.", "description": "\"Conception\" left Santa Barbara Harbor for a recreational scuba diving trip on Saturday.
