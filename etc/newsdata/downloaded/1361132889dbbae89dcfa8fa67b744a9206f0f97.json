I still remember when we had to remove the used condoms and needles before our kids could play at several public playgrounds.\n\nThe only people who benefit from this legislation are the pimps, prostitutes and drug dealers of D.C., which sends a sad message out into our communities. This town used to be seen as crime-ruled and -riddled, so it wasn\u2019t considered a safe place to visit or work. But now our parks are clean and safe, you can enjoy jogging and other outdoor activities throughout the city, and tourism has increased.\n\nI hope D.C. Council members consider how this law will hurt the economy of the city and make it harder to attract new businesses. A city can\u2019t make money if crime runs the streets.\n\nGREG RALEIGH\n\nWashington\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
