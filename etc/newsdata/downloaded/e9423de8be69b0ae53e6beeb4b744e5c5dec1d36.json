With a combined 26 knockouts on their resumes, each has made a career of turning the lights out on their opponents.\n\nWhen asked about a potential fight with Ngannou, Johnson said he\u2019d be interested only if the stakes were high, and that a fight that big would have to have implications like a title on the line.\n\nNgannou echoed that sentiment.\n\n\u201cI listened to what he said, and he said it well,\u201d Ngannou told MMA Junkie. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say it better than that. If they put it in the right context and they put the right elements for that fight, then it should happen. But it won\u2019t just be like, \u2018OK, just go fight. Entertain people. Just go do some main event,\u2019 or whatever, or some special fight. That doesn\u2019t interest me.\u201d\n\nNgannou is currently chasing gold, and has had to sit on the sidelines waiting for the right fight. He is on a three-fight winning streak with finishes over Curtis Blaydes and former heavyweight champions Cain Velasquez and Junior Dos Santos.", "description": "Francis Ngannou would also be interested in fighting Anthony Johnson but only if it was in the right context.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ufc_espn_3_junior_dos_santos_vs_francis_ngannou_8.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
