But Kings officials aren't taking any chances.\n\nThe 2012 and 2014 Stanley Cup champions haven't won a playoff series since their home arena, Staples Center, put up a banner in 2015 celebrating Swift's record number of sellout concerts there.\n\nThe NHL team covered up the banner for Saturday's home opener \u2014 which, coincidentally, was against the Nashville Predators.\n\n\u201cThe connection to our fans is our highest priority and through our engagement they have made it clear that the banner shouldn\u2019t be part of their Kings game experience,\u201d Michael Altieri, senior vice president of marketing, communications and content for the Kings, told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nL.A.'s two NBA teams who play at Staples Center have differing philosophies on the unfurled fabric. The Clippers cover Swift's banner, along with those of the Lakers and the WNBA's Sparks, for their home games. The Lakers don't cover anything.\n\nSwift hasn't performed at Staples Center since her record-setting 16th sellout on Aug. 21, 2015.", "description": "L.A.
