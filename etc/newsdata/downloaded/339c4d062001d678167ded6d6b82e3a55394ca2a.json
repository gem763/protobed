He was much better in the army than I was. He was a very good tactician, as you can see.\n\n\"Then we met up again when I was the physio and he was the captain of the university team.\"\n\nNienaber added that over the years the relationship had endured its fair share of tests.\n\n\"We have been friends for a long time, but as we always say, whenever there is a rugby decision that needs to be discussed, sometimes we disagree and we get angry at each other,\" he said.\n\n\"But it\u2019s never personal. It\u2019s always to make the team better.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got a good relationship in terms of that. We are friends on the one side, but Rassie is my boss.\n\n\"We can have a drink together, but when we have to make decisions about rugby, we don\u2019t have egos of accepting the route we want to take.\"\n\nKick-off on Sunday is at 11:00 (SA time).\n\nTeams:\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 S'bu Nkosi, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn\n\nWales\n\nTBA", "description": "One of the most impressive aspects of the Springboks at the 2019 Rugby World Cup has been their robust defence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9410/57fb31f414054630aba8503398e67383.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
