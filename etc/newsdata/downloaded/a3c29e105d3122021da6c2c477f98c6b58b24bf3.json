Perhaps the best captain India has ever had was now ruling the cricket board. When one takes into account that Virat Kohli is in charge of the team, well it does look like an imposing combination.\n\nKohli's way of conducting himself on the field is similar to the way Ganguly was back in his playing days. By Dada's own admission, one does see a lot of him in the current captain. Perhaps then it is a good thing that Dada is heading the board with Kohli at the helm of the team. Ganguly has already extended his support to Kohli calling him the most important man in Indian cricket and their partnership is expected to be legendary.\n\nBCCI\n\nGanguly's stint for the moment, is for 10 months. He may or may not get an extension but right now he is the boss. So over this period expect to see some great things both in the administration or by the team itself. Ganguly shall handle the logistics while Kohli takes care of business out in the middle. Both have their playing fields and both know what is expected of them. Needless to say, both know how to do their jobs.\n\nWhile Kohli looks to win more games and also make sure we are all set for the World T20 next year, Ganguly shall be looking at key issues like money from ICC, domestic players' payments, day/night Tests etc. Knowing both these individuals' ability to succeed, expect some great things for Indian cricket both on the field and in the administration.\n\nDon't Miss 312 SHARES 162 SHARES 3.8 K SHARES\n\nCricbuzz\n\nBoth have their priorities and their success shall rub off on each other. Needless to say, Indian cricket will benefit both as an institution and as a sport. Fast forward 10 months from now, and one can see a brighter picture of the game in the country. We are in a good place now, we shall be in a better place then.", "description": "On October 23, Sourav Ganguly began his tenure as the 39th president of the BCCI.
