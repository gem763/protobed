He also predicted that the U.K. government will set up a payments system in which small- and medium-sized enterprises would own and be able to transfer the financial and demographic data they generated. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: Unlike regulators who\u2019ve mainly focused on the financial-stability and money-laundering implications of digital currencies like the Facebook-led Libra, Carney has also spoken positively about such coins. He is also keen to encourage competition between them, citing India, whose central and commercial banks have partnered on an electronic payments settlement system. \u201cThe heart of payments is interoperability,\u201d said fellow panelist Nandan Nilekani, noting that the setup allows users of different services to send money to one another. Nilekani is a former tech executive who led the digital identity program on which the payments system is partly based. \u201cThe uniqueness of this model is that Big Tech participates along with the banks,\u201d he said; no banks are part of the Libra project. David Marcus, head of Facebook\u2019s Calibra financial services division, said while the Indian model is a good one, \u201cthose efforts are often domestic, in one region,\u201d and that there\u2019s a need for a new global system to move money around the world.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
