Mr Fitzgibbon said the new lump sum should be bigger. The Coalition announced Thursday it would give drought-affected farmers a one-off payment of up to $13,500. The one-time farm household allowance, available to residents of drought-affected areas after their four-year allotted assistance is up, equates to $7,000 for single people and $13,500 for couples.
