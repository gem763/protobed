Since its founding in 2014, the LVMH Prize has sought to provide emerging talent from around the world with both. Past recipients include Grace Wales Bonner, Marine Serre, and Japanese streetwear designer Masayuki Ino for his label Doublet in 2018. On Wednesday morning, the 26-year-old designer Thebe Magugu was awarded this year\u2019s prize, which includes a \u20ac300,000 grant and a year-long mentorship.\n\nOriginally from South Africa, Magugu is the first African designer to be awarded the LVMH Prize. He studied fashion design in Johannesburg before founding his namesake womenswear label in 2017. \u201cCreating clothes with cultural significance, exploring social issues, sharing stories from my country, empowering those I can, and making beautiful yet functional clothes women want to wear has been a checklist I continually hold the brand to,\u201d he wrote after becoming one of eight finalists for the Prize in March.\n\nOthers up for this year\u2019s Prize were: Kunihiko Morinaga of Anrealage, Bethany Williams, Emily Adams Bode of Bode, Hed Mayner, Kenneth Izedonmwen of Kenneth Ize, Spencer Phipps of Phipps, and Stefan Cooke and Jake Burt of Stefan Cooke. Hed Mayner was awarded the Karl Lagerfeld Prize, formerly known as the Special Jury Prize, which Simon Porte Jacquemus won in 2015.\n\nMagugu was selected by a jury of industry leaders including Marc Jacobs, Maria Grazia Chiuri of Dior, Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re of Louis Vuitton, Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy, and LVMH executives. Look out to see what he does next.", "description": "Since its founding in 2014, the LVMH Prize has sought to provide young designers with the funds, mentorship, and connections they need to succeed.
