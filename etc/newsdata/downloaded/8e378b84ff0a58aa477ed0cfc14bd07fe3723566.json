I think you could argue that\u2019s when they blew the league.\n\n\u2018Liverpool were really poor on the day. We know the qualities they\u2019ve got, we know they\u2019re a good team, but they\u2019ve got to come to Old Trafford and prove they can win a game there.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has named Manchester City's Pep Guardiola and Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp as the two best managers in the world.
