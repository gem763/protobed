The number of uninsured rose by nearly two million people overall, the Census Bureau said, which is about how many fewer people were covered under Medicaid compared with 2017. The number of people covered by private insurance didn't significantly change.\n\nThe 27.5 million people without health coverage represents 8.5% of Americans, up from 7.9%, or 25.6 million people, in 2017, according to the census data. The percentage increase is the first since one from 2008 to 2009.\n\n\"As the economy continues to slowly improve, people's incomes were maybe going up a bit and that was enough to pull them out of Medicaid but not enough for job-based coverage,\" said Rachel Garfield, a vice president at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe ACA, which mostly went into effect in early 2014, reduced the number of uninsured in large part through the expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income and unemployed people. Enrollment in the program rose by 14.7 million people between 2013 and 2019, with most of the increase coming in states that expanded the program. Several Republican-led states haven't expanded their Medicaid eligibility.\n\nSome 91.5% of Americans had health-insurance coverage for all or part of 2018, compared with 92.1% in 2017.\n\nThe growth in the uninsured population is bad news for the health-insurance industry. Insurers have benefited from overall expansion in their enrollment under the 2010 law, much of it in Medicaid, because states increasingly turn to private companies to manage the program. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, payments to Medicaid managed-care companies added up to $264 billion in fiscal 2017, or around 46% of total Medicaid spending.\n\nEmployment-based insurance, insurers' traditional bread and butter, also stagnated in 2018, as did the share of people buying their own plans. The change in private coverage wasn't statistically significant, but it cut against the employment trend in a strong economy.\n\n\"It's a very troubling beginning to an erosion of coverage,\" said John Gorman, a former health-care consultant who is now an investor. \"We've got a growing economy and you'd expect the number of the uninsured would go down.\"\n\nThe report did point to an important bright spot for the insurance industry: the continued growth of Medicare, as Baby Boomers increasingly age into the program. As with Medicaid, private companies play a growing role in the federal program, with about one-third of beneficiaries enrolled in insurers' Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates have made expanding coverage beyond the ACA a central campaign plank. That comes as some Republican-led states have moved to tighten Medicaid eligibility requirements and as the Trump administration has worked to undercut the law, including by supporting a multistate lawsuit aimed at striking down the entire law.\n\n\"The relentless effort by Republicans to sabotage our health-care system has resulted in millions of fewer Americans with health insurance and skyrocketing costs for American families,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).\n\nAmong adults aged 19 to 64, the youngest group, up to age 25, was among the most likely to be uninsured, according to the census data. That demographic had an uninsured rate of 14.3%. The census data said the proportion of uninsured children under age 19 increased by 0.6 percentage point between 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe rise in uninsured comes despite strong wage growth and thousands of new jobs. Earlier data had indicated an uptick in the number of uninsured, so the findings didn't surprise some policy analysts. They said a host of factors are at play, including the new Medicaid restrictions by some GOP states that may have resulted in some people losing coverage. Congressional Republicans also ended the ACA's penalty on people who don't have insurance, which also prodded some people to forgo coverage.\n\nRepublicans who have long opposed the ACA blame the law's regulations, including a mandate that insurers can't deny coverage based on consumers' pre-existing health conditions, for driving up premiums that they say lead to coverage losses.\n\nIn 2018, the average premium for a benchmark health plan bought on one of the ACA's health exchanges -- a gross amount not including any premium tax credits -- was about 34% higher than it was in 2017, according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office, though people who get subsidies on coverage that they buy through ACA exchanges are largely protected from the impact of the higher costs.\n\n\"It's just too expensive,\" said Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, a public-policy free-market research organization. \"People are siphoning themselves off.\"\n\nAbout 11% of Americans purchased their health coverage directly last year, the Census Bureau said, a group that includes those who bought coverage on the ACA exchanges.\n\nThe coverage decrease could play into the 2020 campaign by emboldening Democratic candidates such as Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts who back Medicare for All, which would move all Americans to a federal-government-run health system.\n\nIt could also rally support for the expansion of Medicaid in states that haven't expanded the program. Advocates in Oklahoma and Missouri are pushing to get initiatives on Medicaid expansion on the ballot in 2020.\n\nThe uninsured rate in 2018 rose by 0.6 percentage point in states that expanded Medicaid, to 3.5%, for people living at or above 400% of poverty, or about $80,000 for a family of three, according to the census data. It rose 1.7 percentage points to 6.2% in states that didn't expand Medicaid for this group.\n\nThirty-seven states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid under the ACA.\n\n--Anna Wilde Mathews contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 10, 2019 18:02 ET (22:02 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
