The other 11 Pacific Rim countries, including big farm producers such as New Zealand and Canada, went ahead without the United States and were enjoying preferential treatment in Japan.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory for America\u2019s farmers, ranchers and growers. And that\u2019s very important to me,\u201d Trump said in a signing ceremony at the White House.\n\nBut Tami Overby, senior director on Asia and trade issues at the McLarty Associates consultancy, said America\u2019s competitors in agriculture got a two-year head start and used it to sign multi-year contracts in Japan to sell farm products. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to thrash back and fight for lost market share,\u201d she said.\n\nThe deal comes at a time when other parts of the Trump administration\u2019s trade agenda have stalled. The United States has been locked in a costly trade war with China for more than a year \u2014 though negotiators are scheduled to resume talks in Washington on Thursday. Congress has yet to approve a North American trade deal Trump\u2019s trade team negotiated last year with Canada and Mexico.\n\nWhile rewarding American farmers, the new U.S.-Japan mini-deal does not resolve differences over trade in autos. Trump has said the two countries continue to work on a more comprehensive agreement.\n\nTrump has threatened to impose import taxes on foreign autos, claiming they pose a threat to U.S. national security. At the UN general assembly, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that Trump had assured him that a previous agreement to spare Japan from new auto tariffs still stood.\n\nBut Japanese automakers were disappointed that the United States kept existing auto tariffs at 2.5%.\n\nThe limited trade pact also includes market-opening commitments on $40 billion worth of digital trade between the two countries.\n\nMonday\u2019s Japan deal, Overby said, \u201cis important, but it\u2019s still not the whole enchilada.\u201d U.S. business groups are holding out for a broader deal that would give American companies more access to Japan in businesses such as insurance and pharmaceuticals.\n\nTrump has long complained about America\u2019s large trade deficit with Japan, which came to $58 billion last year. Japan is the world\u2019s third-biggest economy behind the United States and China.\n\nNews of a U.S. pact with Japan might sound familiar. The deal was first announced at the August Group of 7 summit in Biarritz, France. At the UN gathering last month, the two countries signed an agreement-in-principle.", "description": "The United States and Japan signed a limited trade agreement Monday, a deal that would win back benefits American farmers lost when President Donald Trump...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS813_usjapa_ZG_20191007173551.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
