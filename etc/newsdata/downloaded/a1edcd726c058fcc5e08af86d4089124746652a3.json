No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nSeveral sources said that the Speaker is not conditioning the move on impeachment on President Trump producing a whistleblower complaint that prompted questions of whether he leveraged military aid to compel a foreign government to damage a political rival. The speaker said that the Director of National Intelligence had a choice before testifying before Congress on Thursday: \u201cHe will have to choose whether to break the law or honor his duty to the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of Pelosi\u2019s support for impeachment proceedings is Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Details of the call have been reported by several news outlets, came to light in the wake of the complaint from an anonymous whistleblower who has attempted to get their report before lawmakers. The Trump administration moved last week to block that complaint from reaching the House Intelligence Committee, even though such complaints require a congressional review if they are deemed urgent\u2014which the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) announced on Tuesday\u2014before Pelosi\u2019s appearance\u2014that his committee might see testimony from the whistleblower as soon as this week. The whistleblower is reportedly aiming to speak to members of the GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee, which will see testimony from the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump tweeted from the United Nations General Assembly that he would release an un-redacted transcript of his phone call with Zelensky as soon as Wednesday. Speaking at The Atlantic magazine festival in D.C. earlier Tuesday, Pelosi made clear that transcripts were the beginning, not the end, of attempts to get to the bottom of the Ukraine matter and that there were other issues that would inform impeachment proceedings beyond what happened in Ukraine.\n\nThis week\u2019s turn of events has pushed Pelosi into territory that seemed unimaginable just days ago. The longtime House Democratic leader has worked to quell the brewing impeachment movement in her caucus from the moment she took the speaker\u2019s gavel in January. She managed to pull off that feat even as Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report detailed possible obstruction of justice by the president and the administration stonewalled Democrats\u2019 subpoenas for documents and testimony to learn more. That obstruction helped swelled the ranks of House Democrats who backed impeachment. But the past few days have brought the number to a near-critical mass and lawmakers said on Tuesday that there was full support for the speaker's announcement.\n\n\u201cI think that the most important thing that I think I would just convey to you is that unlike any other caucus meeting, there was broad consensus. I did not hear one word of dissent,\u201d said Rep Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL). \u201cAnd that\u2019s the first time that I recall, that\u2019s occurred in a discussion of the President.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s reluctance to move forward\u2014rooted in the belief that an impeachment proceeding based on these topics would backfire politically\u2014frustrated the party\u2019s progressive base but largely satisfied the moderates who delivered Democrats their majority in 2018.\n\nThe calculus has clearly changed, due to a string of explosive news reports detailing activity by Trump that would be far easier to work into an impeachment case than what Mueller outlined.\n\nIndeed, those same reluctant moderates have, in the past 24 hours, come out in droves to express support for impeachment. Freshman House Democrats who flipped seats that were long held by Republicans\u2014and that Trump won in 2016\u2014voiced support for impeachment based on the Ukraine story, though many said they\u2019d back impeachment if the Ukraine allegations were proven by congressional investigators. At the same time, progressive holdouts closely allied with Pelosi jumped on the impeachment train, too, signaling that they privately had the speaker\u2019s backing.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, a majority of House members were publicly supportive of impeachment.\n\nWith reporting by Jackie Kucinich", "description": "The move caps off a wave of House Democrats getting in line behind impeaching the president over allegations Trump asked foreign leaders to assist his re-election.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Sam Stein", "Congressional Reporter", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2912,w_5178,x_0,y_417/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569353365/GettyImages-1169803390_l6zkeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
