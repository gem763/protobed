What I Own is a sister series to What I Rent, which is the same idea but focusing on renting.\n\nBoth series are intended to take an honest look at the reality of housing, from the dodgy landlords and absurdly priced studio flats to how on earth people save up for a deposit.\n\nThis week we\u2019re chatting to Jade Vanriel, a 26-year-old blogger and business owner.\n\nJade is a law graduate who used to work in product management and advertising. She managed to buy a house at the age of 23.\n\nBut \u2013 spoiler \u2013 like many people who buy a house, a big part of Jade being able to afford the deposit was living with her aunt, so not having to faff around with the expensive rents the average person has to face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe still had to work hard and save even with that significant leg-up, but was able to get a mortgage on a two-bedroom flat in Harrow.\n\nShe paid a \u00a327,000 deposit at 23 (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk the deposit. How much did you need to save?\n\nI managed to save \u00a327k for my deposit over seven years. While at college and uni I had multiple part-time jobs and once I finished uni I went straight into work with the intention to save most of my earnings.\n\nAnd how much was the total amount of your mortgage?\n\nIt was around \u00a3200,000. I\u2019ve owned my flat for three years now \u2013 I was 23 when I bought it\n\nHow did you find the flat?\n\nI was constantly online looking at sites like Rightmove, Zoopla etc. I set up loads of email alerts daily and spent every Saturday going on viewings for months until I found the right flat\n\nWhat was the process of getting a mortgage like? Did you feel prepared?\n\nI did feel very prepared because I researched a lot of things, I was looking for about a year so plenty of time to ask questions and speak with my mortgage broker on anything I didn\u2019t understand. I would say the only part I struggled with was having bidding wars and getting gazumped so many times!\n\nNow Jade pays \u00a3600 a month to pay off her mortgage, and around \u00a3400 for bills (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nAnd how much do you pay each month for your mortgage?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mortgage is roughly \u00a3600 a month and I would say about \u00a3400 for household bills.\n\nWhy Essex?\n\nHaving been born and raised in London I wanted somewhere quieter and an easy commute, so I chose Essex as it\u2019s so easy to get to London on a day to day basis and much more affordable.\n\nDo you feel like you have enough space in the flat?\n\nYes, I do for the next few years. I\u2019ve used the second bedroom as my wardrobe and office space which I am so lucky to have.\n\nThe flat has loads of cosy and comforting touches (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nHow does owning a home feel different to renting?\n\nI never rented before owning my home. I did live with an aunt and pay towards bills but I didn\u2019t have a proper renting experience.\n\nHow have you made the flat feel like home?\n\nI took my time with redecorating because I didn\u2019t have a big budget, so many things were a DIY project like my kitchen. I only changed the cabinet doors and painted the wooden worktop grey. I documented the process on my YouTube channel and people loved it.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a sofa or flooring for six months until I could comfortably afford to do those things. And I only just completed my bathroom which was the most expensive room, so now the whole flat is finished!\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted my flat to be fresh and bright yet still cosy so I\u2019ve added all of my favourite things everywhere like cushions, flowers, and candles\n\nAnd lots of fancy bits (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your YouTube channel! You make a lot of videos about home ownership and renovations. Why do you think it\u2019s important to share these?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love sharing my experience and tips because I don\u2019t feel there is enough real conversation around home ownership.\n\nMy followers come to me for advice and insight and over the past 3 years my audience has grown so much. Young people want to know more about the process and need practical ways to get onto the property ladder.\n\nWhat are your future plans, home-wise?\n\nI am aiming to buy a house soon, and I would love to hold onto this flat forever as it means so much to me.\n\nOh, cool. A second property. We\u2019ll just go ahead and regret our life choices. Shall we have a look around, though?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the living room (Picture: Alison Jenkins for metro.co.uk)\n\nLook at that plush sofa (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nShe\u2019s not kidding about her love for candles (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of grey and silver in this room (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nMore candles and infusers\u2026 try to keep count, we dare you (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe like that pink chair (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nNext door is the kitchen (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nVery nice, very white (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nGotta have champagne handy (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nThere\u2019s a nice dining table, too (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nJade uses the second bedroom as an office and wardrobe (Picture: Alison Jenkins for Metro.co.uk)\n\nSpot a colour theme in this room?
