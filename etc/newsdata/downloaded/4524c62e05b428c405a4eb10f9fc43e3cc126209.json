This ordinary conversation would have ordinarily been placed instead on an ordinary server used by multiple federal agencies.\n\nCritics say Trump buried the transcript on the secret server because it revealed Trumpian misdeeds. Sure looks like a cover-up.\n\nBut the story changed a bit over the next couple of days. Apparently, the Trump White House has been using this secret server for years to store transcripts of Trump phone calls. Why? According to intelligence community sources who dish to reporters, it began after \u201c[b]ack-to-back leaks of controversial remarks by President Trump during calls with leaders of Mexico and Australia,\u201d in the words of the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhat were the \u201ccontroversial remarks\u201d that leaked out of those calls? Well, that's just the thing. Nobody asserted that those phone calls revealed an abuse of power, collusion, or anything even possibly illegal. Rather, the \u201ccontroversy\u201d was that the calls went poorly and could easily be presented to make Trump look bad.\n\nThe intelligence officials who leaked those Australia and Mexico transcripts weren\u2019t whistleblowers by any stretch of the word. They were politically motivated leakers having a bit of fun at Trump's expense.\n\nBut when the intelligence community leaks the president\u2019s phone calls to make him look bad, that is malfeasance. This sort of malfeasance has become the norm in the Trump era, and it\u2019s set off a spiral of paranoia, secrecy, dishonesty, and distrust that has helped bring us to the precipice of impeachment.\n\nTrump is an extraordinary human being, unlike anyone else who has been even close to the Oval Office. He came in lacking experience in politics or policy. Most importantly, he came in lacking the comportment or habits we would normally find in a statesman.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency was bound to put America\u2019s institutions under a stress test. The intelligence community, the bureaucracy, Congress, the courts, and the media were going to be tempted by this man who didn\u2019t follow the standard rules of politics. Would these institutions respond by doing their jobs, or would they respond by breaking norms? Would they believe that an unsteady captain required a steady crew, or would they decide that the old rules didn\u2019t apply and wage a quiet mutiny?\n\nUnfortunately, many supposed guardians of our democracy responded to Trump's election by smashing norms themselves. Sally Yates, acting as attorney general, flatly refused to enforce the law because merely she thought it unwise and unjust. James Comey, the FBI director, appears to have laid subtle threats and traps for the president. Many of our colleagues in the press utterly abandoned their sobriety when faced with Trump.\n\nAnd then some in the intelligence community took to using their access to the president\u2019s phone calls as a way to leak information that simply made him look bad. And so Trump\u2019s White House, to keep every single phone call from being leaked, responded with its own norm-breaking: it became more paranoid and more opaque. It moved to the secret server phone calls that would normally be placed on a standard server. But \u201cnormally\u201d doesn\u2019t apply anymore, it seems. Our politics has come to feature a vicious circle of ever-escalating norm-breaking.\n\nThis is bad news if you're a conservative who believes laws and politicians can never keep peace but that norms and customs are always necessary. It's bad news if you're a liberal, who these days regularly lament the smashing of norms.\n\nIt's bad news for America where nobody feels the need to play by the rules and nobody thinks the other side cares about the rules.", "description": "In the whistleblower story about President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, one important detail has changed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a05e51c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fea%2F14%2Fb6d4812b4568b6786250cf492c31%2Fap-18239470914276.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
