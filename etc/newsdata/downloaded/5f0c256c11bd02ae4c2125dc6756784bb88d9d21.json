If the company meets its goal, it will use no more than 350,000 tonnes (386,000 tons) of new plastic each year from 2025, down from around 700,000 tonnes (772,000 tons) in 2018.\n\nTo get there, Unilever will offer more reusable and refillable packaging, and sell more \"naked,\" or unwrapped, products. The company will also use more recycled plastic in its packaging.\n\n\"There is a lot of plastic pollution in the environment. And the fact of the matter is \u2014 too much of it carries our name,\" Unilever said in a statement.\n\nUnilever has been developing new ways to deliver its products, which the company says are used daily by 2.5 billion people in over 190 countries.
