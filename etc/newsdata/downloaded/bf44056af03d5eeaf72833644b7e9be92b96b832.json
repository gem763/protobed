Dubbed \u201cThe Moment,\u201d the photo clinched the grand title in the competition, which saw 48,000 entries received from 100 countries.\n\nThe competition winners were named during an awards ceremony at London\u2019s Museum of Natural History on Tuesday.\n\nENORMOUS LION TERRIFIES PHOTOGRAPHER WITH LOUD ROAR \u2014 THEN SMILES AT HIM\n\n\u201cPhotographically, it is quite simply the perfect moment. The expressive intensity of the postures holds you transfixed, and the thread of energy between the raised paws seems to hold the protagonists in perfect balance,\u201d said Roz Kidman Cox, chair of the judging panel, in a statement. \u201cImages from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are rare enough, but to have captured such a powerful interaction between a Tibetan fox and a marmot -- two species key to the ecology of this high-grassland region -- is extraordinary.\u201d\n\nThe female fox was hunting to keep her three cubs alive when she pounced on the marmot, according to the museum. Yongqing Bao captured the marmot\u2019s final moments, as the unfortunate rodent was killed by the fox, according to the BBC.\n\nThe Natural History Museum notes that, while Tibetan foxes are not hunted or persecuted, their prey is. \u201cThe foxes are dependent on a small mammal known as the plateau pika, a species which has been subject to eradication attempts,\u201d it said, in its statement. \u201cIf the pikas are wiped out, the foxes will be quick to follow.\u201d\n\nRARE POLKA-DOTTED BABY ZEBRA DISCOVERED IN KENYA, INCREDIBLE PHOTOS SHOW\n\nNatural History Museum Director Sir Michael Dixon said that climate change poses a threat to the Tibetan fox\u2019s habitat.\n\n\u201cThe area in which this was taken, often referred to as the \u2018Third Pole\u2019 because of the enormous water reserves held by its ice fields, is under threat from dramatic temperature rises like those seen in the Arctic,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cAt a time when precious habitats are facing increasing climate pressures, seeing these fleeting yet fascinating moments reminds us of what we need to protect.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "A remarkable photo of a fox battling a marmot in the remote Qilian mountains of China has won the top award in the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/WildlifePhotographeroftheYearYongqingBao.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
