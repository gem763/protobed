Fox hires \u201cgive Hillary the questions\u201d @donnabrazile, Juan Williams and low ratings Shep Smith. HOPELESS & CLUELESS! They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That\u2019s what I do, Win. Too Bad!.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2019\n\n....I don\u2019t want to Win for myself, I only want to Win for the people. The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2019\n\nBaier says he has taken Trump's criticism towards the network and himself \"in stride\" because \"it's part of the deal.\"\n\n\"Listen, we're just trying to call balls and strikes. And if we can do that everyday, be fair to him, but also cover the news fairly to all sides, that's what I'm trying do,\" he said.\n\nHe was then asked if he feels Trump using \"enemy of the people\" to describe journalists consistently \"endangers\" them.\n\n\"I think it is a problem. I don't love that. That's a bad phrase. I think we're all trying to do our job,\" Baier replied.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/22/2019 11:04:39AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/295/519c6f1c-07a4-4822-bd20-a68af1bb7fed.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
