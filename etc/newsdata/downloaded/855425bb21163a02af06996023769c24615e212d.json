There are worse fates, you know? But in 2019, a year where the news outweirds itself on a daily basis and events feel plucked from a randomizer that\u2019s pulling ideas out of a hat, our current status is equally plausible: Untitled Goose Game is not just a funny game but an excellent one.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t played Untitled Goose Game yet, you should. It\u2019s both short and funny as heck, a biting combo. Austin\u2019s review from last month, comparing the game to Hitman, is worth a read. It\u2019s the kind of game you can play with people who claim they don\u2019t like games, and if you have children, they will enjoy pressing the HONK button over and over again. In a time when you have infinite games to play, it\u2019s still worth carving out some time for this one.\n\nBy all accounts, Untitled Goose Game is a success, in that it\u2019s sold a lot of copies. But it\u2019s also been a very different type of success: Untitled Goose Game is a meme, a cultural icon.\n\nUntitled Goose Game has achieved an awareness most games dream of, drawing interest from surprising places. A few days back, Twin Peaks actor Kyle MacLachlan tweeted about trying to track down the elusive goose. One of social media\u2019s universally beloved icons, Chrissy Teigen, who\u2019s shown an interest in games in the past, wanted to know what was up. At TwitchCon, the band Blink-182 was hyping up the crowd by giving the game a shout out.\n\nThere\u2019s also fan art everywhere, transporting the havoc-inducing goose to moments in time where their unconventional approach to the world could have benefits, to turning the bird into a symbol for the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. There\u2019s a good chance people are sharing Untitled Goose Game jokes without knowing Untitled Goose Game is a real game.\n\nWhich is all to say this must be a surreal moment for House House, the developers of Untitled Goose Game. It is not their first game. Push Me Pull You, a gross-looking sports game about bodies stretching to unnatural lengths, put them on the map during the local multiplayer trend. But Untitled Goose Game is another level of attention. It\u2019s a phenomenon.\n\nIt has to be a moment that\u2019s given House House pause, and I wanted to know more about that pause. Fortunately, Untitled Goose Game designer Michael McMaster was willing to spend some time with me recently over email, answering everything from the absurd to the insightful. We talked about everything from the politics of the goose, to a shocking revelation about the origins of its HONK, to the haphazard and fumbly way the game was developed. It's a chat as wide-ranging as the game itself.\n\nVICE Games: This morning, I asked my three-year-old daughter what sound a goose makes. She told me \"goose goose goose.\" When I told her it was, in fact, \"honk,\" she shook her head and repeated \"goose goose goose.\" Thoughts?\n\nMichael McMaster: I mean, I'm not the authority on geese\u2014the meaning of art is malleable and should be in the hands of its consumers, not its creators. Can't say I totally agree, but that\u2019s her opinion and I respect it. \u201cGoose goose goose,\u201d sure, love it.\n\nVICE Games: Untitled Goose Game is, as of this writing, the most popular game on the eShop. It's a meme. It's being talked about by everyone from Blink-182 to Chrissy Teigen. Are you doing OK? Be honest.\n\nThat\u2019s a really thoughtful question\u2014I wish I could give a straightforward answer. The four of us are mainly overwhelmed, I think. We\u2019re happy, of course, but we\u2019re also very tired, and emotionally fragile, and probably a bit manic. It\u2019s been a very strange feeling to be able to, at any moment, open up our Twitter notifications and see a flood of positive responses to the game, and videos, and people making memes, and BRANDS making memes, and Blink 182 and Chrissy Teigen, and everything else. It\u2019s weird to be able to turn that tap on at any point, and it\u2019s sometimes hard to turn it off. So we\u2019re all a bit overstimulated, maybe.\n\nWe knew from when we first posted our trailer that people were excited about the game, but throughout development I think we all operated in this very risk-averse way\u2014trying not to get our hopes up, reminding ourselves that maybe people just like to watch videos of this game, and might not actually enjoy playing it. We were very prepared for the most pessimistic outcome, but I don\u2019t think we ever let ourselves prepare for the most optimistic one. Trying to process all of this (while also speaking to a lot of press, and fielding a huge pile of emails, and patching fixes to the game) has made for a very weird couple of weeks.\n\nVICE Games: What's been your favorite moment of this explosion in interest? You can name a few.\n\nAs emotionally complex as everything has been for us, there have been a bunch of moments of totally uncomplicated joy. We\u2019ve been enormous fans of the Scottish comedian Limmy for years, so watching him play through our game was incredible (and the fact that he actually liked it, something we weren\u2019t expecting, was even better).\n\nThe speedrunning scene that has popped up around the game has been absolutely wild to watch. I love speedrunning, and had always secretly hoped that a few people might try it with this game\u2014watching the Any% category get more or less perfected in a matter of days, and then seeing people start to route glitchless and 100% categories, has just been such a totally joyous thing to watch.\n\nAnother thing, which is maybe a bit obvious: the positive critical response has been amazing. We\u2019d known for years that people were excited for this game from its trailers, but were always a bit nervous about how that would affect people\u2019s expectations for the game\u2014the news that it had, apparently, lived up to its hype, let me shed a very specific anxiety that I\u2019d been carrying around for years. Maybe this is too much, but I wanted to say how much I appreciated Austin\u2019s review on your site in particular: throughout development we\u2019d sometimes had to be defensive of the slightly awkward way the goose moved and controlled, though I\u2019d never found a good vocabulary for actually describing WHY it felt good to us\u2014his recognition and description of that stuff was deeply gratifying and relieving to read.\n\nVICE Games: Before we talk too much about where things stand now, can we go back a hot minute? What was the original germ of an idea for Untitled Goose Game? And when did it actually become a game you were making?\n\nThe original moment of inspiration is, thankfully, very clearly documented: in August 2016, Stuart posted a stock photo of a goose in our Slack and said, jokingly, \u201cwe should make a game about this\u201d. We joked for a bit about why we thought geese are funny. I tweeted about it and we all forgot about the conversation for a while.\n\nThis was a few months after we\u2019d released our first game, Push Me Pull You, which was a 2D local-multiplayer game\u2014we knew then that we wanted our next project to be in 3D, and to be single-player. We were also interested in making a game about moving a body around in space in interesting ways (Mario 64 is a major point of inspiration for us)\u2014we played around with a non-goose prototype for a while, but it never really clicked for us. At some point we revisited that Slack conversation and took the idea of a game about a goose seriously. We started out by modelling and animating a goose and giving it a range of things to do\u2014honk, flap, crane its neck, etc. We didn\u2019t have any kind of mechanical context for these actions, we just started with the goose itself. We added some people who had objects that they liked to keep in one place, and if the goose took the objects they\u2019d chase it down and put the objects back in place. We sort of muddled our way into making a systemic stealth-ish game, but it was always a very bottom-up approach\u2014the goose came first.\n\nVICE Games: Possibly the most important question of all: Who is the goose based on? Is there an origin goose? You must have recorded the sound somewhere. Who is the voice of the HONK?\n\nThe goose is based on that stock image of a goose, or maybe the collectively-imagined goose we described in that Slack conversation\u2014our platonic goose. White and orange, frowning mouth, honking noise. A classic goose. We get asked a lot if we\u2019d add an option for a Canada Goose skin, but we\u2019ve always bristled at this\u2014ours is a game about THIS goose, our specific goose, not a customisable goose-avatar.\n\nRegarding the honk: the honk in the game was added by our amazing sound designer, Em Halberstadt. In the credits, there\u2019s a credit for the voice of the goose, too. In our very first trailer before Em had come on board, the goose is actually quacking (but that\u2019s a longer development anecdote and I\u2019ve probably already written too much!)\n\nVICE Games: Sorry, now you have to tell me that anecdote.\n\nOkay, I might\u2019ve oversold this but, yep, our honk was originally a quack. In our first trailer before our sound designer Em had come on board, most of our sounds had been sourced from freesound.org\u2014we had trouble finding a perfect discrete honk, but eventually found one that was nice and short and sharp from a field recording titled \u201cGeese honking\u201d, or something similar. We clipped it out and put it in the trailer. After the trailer blew up in late 2017, we got a bunch of emails telling us that, actually, this was definitively a duck\u2019s quack. We went back and looked up the field recording, and read the expanded description, which was something: \u201cSeveral geese honking recorded in a churchyard in Ireland. There might be one or two duck quacks in there, not sure.\u201d\n\nIt turns out honks are kind of slow and warbly, so it took a long time to find a replacement that had the same qualities as that quack\u2014loud and abrupt and rude. With Em\u2019s very patient expertise we eventually settled on our authentic canonical honk.\n\nVICE Games: Do you remember what the a-ha moment was, once you were playing with the concept? Was there an early puzzle, something that made you all go \"OK, we're onto something here.\"\n\nSo, our original vision for this game was much bigger and more impersonal than where it ended up\u2014we\u2019d imagined a big clockwork system of dozens of little faceless people, all moving around on their own schedule that the goose was there to disrupt. Pretty quickly, though, the game became a lot more detailed and intimate than that. The closest thing to an a-ha moment would\u2019ve been when Jake rigged up the goose and the groundskeeper with an inverse kinematics system, so that they\u2019d turn their heads to look at each other when standing at a certain distance. That eye contact went SUCH a long way to informing the emotional tenor of the game\u2014these two characters staring silently at each other suddenly had this very distinct interpersonal relationship. This was a long way from the impersonal crowds we\u2019d originally envisioned\u2014that simple bit of IK injected so much humanity into the game. It still feels really special.\n\nVICE Games: The world sucks right now. It often sucks, but it really sucks at the moment. There's not much to cheer about, and the news is relentlessly upsetting. But people seem to have latched onto Untitled Goose Game and run with it; it's become a vehicle of humor, of happiness. Why?\n\nWe\u2019ve been asked this question a few times now and I\u2019ve never found a good answer\u2014I don\u2019t think we as the game\u2019s creators are any better equipped to answer this than anyone else, honestly. I get a bit uncomfortable when people say that this game is \u201cwhat the world needs right now,\u201d or something along those lines - I don\u2019t like the idea that our game (or media in general) succeeds because it anaesthetises people to the horrors of the world, when clarity and action are more urgently necessary than ever. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it, though? I\u2019d be curious to hear what someone with a better grasp of media theory than me might have to say.\n\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of messages from people who have been going through bad times recently, letting us know that our game was a nice respite from that, which I will say was very deeply heartwarming. In very simple terms, we set out to make a funny and joyful game, and it\u2019s extremely gratifying to hear that for most people we did this successfully. I don\u2019t think I can offer a more nuanced answer than that.\n\n\"We knew from when we first posted our trailer that people were excited about the game, but throughout development I think we all operated in this very risk-averse way\u2014trying not to get our hopes up, reminding ourselves that maybe people just like to watch videos of this game, and might not actually enjoy playing it. We were very prepared for the most pessimistic outcome.\"\n\nVICE Games: Can you talk about the design process for building the world and the puzzles buried within? Everything feels handcrafted, purposeful. Presumably, achieving that was a lot of hard work.\n\nGenerally speaking, our process is generally a bit of a mess\u2014the four of us in House House don\u2019t work with defined development roles or clear ownership over any single part of the game, which means that basically every creative decision needs to be one we\u2019re all happy with. So it\u2019s a lot of talking.\n\nIn this sense, developing the areas and puzzles of our world felt a bit like a writers\u2019 room at times - we\u2019d start with a very broad context (\u201cthe backyards of two neighbours that you play against each other a la Yojimbo\u201d) and then we\u2019d workshop a big list of gags that could potentially take place within that context. Once we had a few setpieces in mind, Jake would start building a level around them, which typically underwent a lot of revision as we tried to shoehorn in setups for more gags.\n\nThere were a few mechanical constraints that we had to keep in mind when it came to actually implementing these gags into the game. The core loop of the game involves people tidying up in the wake of the goose, so we had to devise a way for every puzzle to be self-resetting: this way failed (or successful) pranks could be attempted and enjoyed again. We had a very weird line drawn in the sand regarding how the goose could plausibly interact with the world: they could pick things up and move them around, or interact with simple switches, but they couldn\u2019t combine items with other items or make use of them in a way that feels too clever (so, a goose can turn on a tap, but it can\u2019t put a key in a lock).\n\nVICE Games: The commitment to the bit of a game called Untitled Goose Game was impressive, but you must have, at some point, considered something more traditional. Can you share one of them?\n\nBefore we committed to Untitled Goose Game as a working title (and then eventually as the actual non-title) we were toying with calling it just \u201cGoose\u201d, I think? I honestly have such a hazy memory of that time, but you can see in the first few seconds of the 2017 pre-alpha trailer that we\u2019d titled it that way. It was never a serious consideration, though, just a placeholder.\n\nBeyond that there were never any other actual contenders, I\u2019m sorry. Part of that is because, once we\u2019d posted that first trailer under Untitled Goose Game, we got flooded with suggestions of more or less every conceivable title, and we realised quickly that we were too stubborn to take someone else\u2019s suggestion. I\u2019m glad the title ended up where it did, anyway.\n\nVICE Games: I wanted to follow-up on a point you made regarding the mechanical and creative limits of the goose. How much of that was defined at first, foundationally, and how much of that was discovered as you started putting the game together? It seems like it would have been pretty easy to start designing more elaborate gags that relied on the goose being human-level smart.\n\nI think a lot of those constraints were informed by our own instincts about what felt appropriate to the tone of the game. We didn\u2019t sit down and write out a big design document detailing what we thought the goose could and couldn\u2019t do, but we quickly worked out those implicit boundaries for ourselves anyway\u2014once we\u2019d decided that the goose couldn\u2019t use the groundskeeper\u2019s keys to open the door to the garden, we had to stick with that rule for the rest of the game. For a game like ours, where very few of the game\u2019s implicit rules are spelled out to the player, this kind of consistency is pretty crucial.\n\nThese game design guidelines were meant to support the fictional conceit that this goose could plausibly just be muddling its way through the town like Mr. Magoo, acting on its own instinctual whims, unaware of the consequences of any of its actions. Of course, throughout the game the goose does a bunch of very complex interconnected actions, so there\u2019s a kind of cartoon-logic suspension of disbelief happening (and the existence of the to-do list and the pile of bells throws this all out the window anyway\u2014but it was a useful constraint to keep in mind).\n\nAll of that said, it\u2019s not as though we found ourselves totally fenced-in by this constraint\u2014we weren\u2019t ever trying to concoct especially elaborate gags. The gags that felt right to us were typically very low-stakes and elemental, like any good slapstick bit\u2014we never really wanted to get much more ambitious than pulling a chair away from someone as they\u2019re sitting down.\n\nVICE Games: Has the process of making this game, and the ensuing and surprising response to it, changed any part of your development process? What's the internal legacy of making Untitled Goose Game?\n\nThis is a very good question, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got a particularly good answer in me at the moment! Maybe I could tell you this once we\u2019ve started work on whatever comes next.\n\nVICE Games: Finally, one last question from Austin Walker: You're on the record stating that the villagers of Untitled Goose Game are Marxists, and that in the game's version of the U.K., the Conservative Party declined after a goose chased Thatcher out of office. Does that mean that the goose is a countercultural reactionary, hoping to disrupt this peaceful socialist village and reinstate neoliberal values? Or is it loyal to another school of leftist politics? Trotskyism? Syndicalism? Anarcho-primitivism maybe?\n\nSimilarly to my response to your daughter, I\u2019m gonna have to call \u201cdeath of the author\u201d on this one. If you\u2019re happiest playing the game through the lens of the goose as a tankie, sure, go for it! We\u2019re certainly overjoyed to see people claiming the goose as a leftist icon.\n\nAs far as we\u2019re concerned, though, the goose is a goose\u2014I\u2019d said before that the goose can\u2019t put a key in a lock, so we probably also need to concede that it can\u2019t also be motivated by a complex political ideology. The goose is just a goose. That tweet we wrote was a tongue-in-cheek pushback against this idea that it\u2019s necessary to think of these townspeople as evil in order to enjoy harassing them\u2014we have a very deep fondness for these villagers and felt like they deserved defending. They\u2019re working class people just trying to get on with their day, and you are a horrible goose\u2014you're meant to feel at least a little bit bad about what you\u2019re doing.\n\nI\u2019m very wary, though, of this being taken as a kind of deluded \u201cour games don\u2019t have politics\u201d position. It\u2019s definitely not\u2014like all creative work, this game was made through a series of political decisions. Even if this doesn\u2019t explicitly manifest in the text of the game, there are a bunch of ambient traces of our politics evident throughout it: this is why there are no cops in the game, and why there\u2019s no crown on the postbox. This isn\u2019t to say we\u2019ve executed things perfectly\u2014there are definitely big problems inherent to our presentation of rural England as a rosy storybook utopia. But we do try to be critical in how we reflect the world through our games, and responsible about the conditions of their production.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter.
