(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) on Friday chastised President Trump for his late-night assertion that he has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to enlist foreign countries in corruption investigations, as another day of high drama unfolded in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nFallout continued Friday from the late night release of text messages by House investigators, while another key figure, the inspector general of the intelligence community, prepared to testify on Capitol Hill behind closed doors.\n\nEarly Friday, Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor also said he would conduct an \u201caudit\u201d of an investigation related to former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nThe texts released late Thursday show how State Department officials coordinated with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s top aide and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer to leverage a potential summit between Trump and Zelensky on a promise from the Ukrainians to investigate an energy company that employed Hunter Biden.\n\nThe White House also faced a Friday deadline to produced documents related to the controversy or be served with a subpoena.\n\n\u25cfTrump publicly calls on China to investigate Bidens\n\n\u25cfTrump\u2019s removal would require Republican dissidents. But those who speak out become targets of viral disinformation.\n\n\u25cfTrump wanted Ukraine\u2019s president to launch investigations before face-to-face meeting, State Dept. texts show\n\nRead the whistleblower complaint | The rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky | House Democrats\u2019 letter on State Department texts\n\n8:50 a.m.: Trump seizes on unemployment rate in arguing against impeachment\n\nTrump seized the release of new unemployment numbers Friday morning to argue against his impeachment.\n\n\u201cBreaking News: Unemployment Rate, at 3.5%, drops to a 50 YEAR LOW,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWow America, lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!).\u201d\n\nTrump made no mention that the same report showed the economy adding a modest 136,000 jobs in September, in what is likely to be interpreted as further evidence that the country is headed for a slowdown.\n\n[U.S. economy added just 136,000 jobs in September, in fresh sign economy is cooling]\n\n8:25 a.m.: Schiff says Republicans must decide if Trump has \u2018absolute right\u2019 he claims\n\nIn a morning tweet, Schiff responded to Trump\u2019s late-night assertion that he has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to enlist foreign countries in corruption investigations.\n\nTrump\u2019s contention, in a tweet, came at the end of a day in which he publicly urged both Ukraine and Biden to investigation the business dealings of Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to this,\u201d Schiff tweeted. \u201cWe\u2019ve cut through the denials. The deflections. The nonsense. Donald Trump believes he can pressure a foreign nation to help him politically. It\u2019s his \u2018right.\u2019 Every Republican in Congress has to decide: Is he right?\u201d\n\nMinutes after Schiff\u2019s tweet, Trump doubled-down on his assertion.\n\n\u201cAs President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!\u201d\n\n6:45 a.m.: Ukraine\u2019s new chief prosecutor to \u2018audit\u2019 Biden case\n\nKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s new chief prosecutor said Friday his office will conduct an \u201caudit\u201d of an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that had recruited Hunter Biden for its board.\n\nA criminal probe of the company was closed in 2016, and Trump has alleged it was because of pressure by Hunter Biden\u2019s father, Joe Biden, who was then vice president. Trump has insisted that Ukraine open a new investigation.\n\nUkrainian officials said previously that the probe was focused on the years 2010 to 2012, before the younger Biden joined the board. They also have said that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing on his part.\n\nProsecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka told a news conference that he is aware of at least 15 investigations that may have touched on Burisma, its owner Nikolai Zlochevsky, an associate named Serhiy Zerchenko, and Biden, and that all will be reviewed. He said no foreign or Ukrainian official has been in touch with him to request this audit.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Will Englund\n\n7 a.m.: Atkinson to appear before House Intelligence Committee\n\nThe inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, is scheduled to appear behind closed doors in front of the House Intelligence Committee at 10:30 a.m.\n\nAtkinson is the official who received the complaint on Aug. 12 from the whistleblower, based on conversations with more than half a dozen U.S. officials.\n\nTwo weeks later, Atkinson, finding the report credible and urgent, forwarded it to Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence.\n\n6 a.m.: Trump wanted Ukraine\u2019s president to launch investigations before face-to-face meeting, texts show\n\nHouse investigators released numerous text messages late Thursday night illustrating how senior State Department officials coordinated with the Ukrainian president\u2019s top aide and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer to leverage a potential summit between the heads of state on a promise from the Ukrainians to investigate the 2016 U.S. election and an energy company that employed Biden\u2019s son.\n\nThe texts, which former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker provided investigators during a nearly 10-hour deposition Thursday, reveal that officials felt Trump would not agree to meet with Zelensky unless Zelensky promised to launch the investigations \u2014 and did so publicly.\n\nAlthough the texts do not mention Biden by name, congressional Democrats leading an impeachment inquiry are pointing to them as clear evidence that Trump conditioned normal bilateral relations with Ukraine on that country first agreeing \u201cto launch politically motivated investigations,\u201d top Democrats said in statement Thursday night.\n\n\u201cheard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,\u201d Volker texted Zelensky\u2019s aide, Andrey Yermak, on July 25, hours before Trump and the Ukrainian president spoke via phone.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian, Rachael Bade, Josh Dawsey and John Hudson\n\n6 a.m.: Trump asserts \u2018absolute right\u2019 to investigate corruption\n\nTrump on Thursday night asserted an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to investigate corruption, which he said includes reaching out to foreign countries for assistance, and suggested that he might sue Pelosi.\n\nHe comments on Twitter came hours after he told reporters that he would like to see investigations of the Bidens not only by Ukraine but also China, prompting an uproar from congressional Democrats.\n\n\u201cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nLater, he took aim at Pelosi for standing by Schiff\u2019s comments in a hearing last week.\n\nTrump has called for Schiff to resign for remarks in which he embellished Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky.
