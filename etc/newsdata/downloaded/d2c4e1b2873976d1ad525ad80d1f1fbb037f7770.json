In fact, 18 of the 30 fastest-growing jobs from 2018 to 2028 are expected to be in the medical field, it said.\n\nWhile the average growth rate for all occupations will be an estimated 5.2% through 2028, health care support occupations are expected to grow at 18.2% and health care practitioner jobs could expand almost 12%.\n\nHere are four medical jobs that don\u2019t require an M.D., but still make a six-figure median annual salary.\n\n\u2022 Physician assistants made $108,610 in median annual wages in 2018 and have a 11.5% growth projection.\n\n\u2022 Nurse anesthetists made $167,950, with a 17% growth rate.\n\n\u2022 Nurse midwives made $103,770, with a 15.7% growth rate.\n\n\u2022 Nurse practitioners made $107,030 with a 28.2% growth rate.\n\nAll four jobs require master\u2019s degrees, the agency noted. And, to be clear, a master\u2019s degree definitely doesn\u2019t come cheap. One estimate says nurse practitioners emerge with an average of $149,000 in student loans.\n\nBut medical school bills can be even heftier.\n\nThree-quarters of aspiring doctors take on debt to go to medical school, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Students graduate with a $200,000 median debt load, the organization said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: The No. 1 job in America with the \u2018best career opportunities\u2019 pays $112,000 a year \u2014 and it\u2019s not in tech\n\nRenewable energy and computers are two other fast-growing fields, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 biennial projections. Solar panel installers and wind turbine service technicians are jobs with the biggest projected growth rates from 2018 to 2028, expanding at 63.3% and 56.9% respectively.\n\nThe median 2018 pay for a solar panel installer was $42,680, while a turbine service technician made $54,370. Neither position requires a college degree, the agency said. But the occupations are relatively small now and will only add an estimated 9,900 jobs in the coming 10 years.\n\nJobs for computer and IT managers will grow at 11% over the next 10 years. The median annual wage for the job was $142,530 in 2018 and requires a college degree.", "description": "More than half of the fastest growing jobs over the next decade will be in health care, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ677_nurse__ZG_20190904125414.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
