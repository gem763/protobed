(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nDepression is really so very similar to \u2018illnesses du regular\u2019 and yet, at the same time, so bafflingly different.\n\nJust like \u2018normal illnesses\u2019 (like the flu, for example) it can happen to anyone, doesn\u2019t care about your money or your status, needs treatment, and can come back once you thought you were in the clear.\n\nUnlike a lot of other illnesses, though, it takes a completely different form in everyone unfortunate enough to be playing host to it, and thus reacts differently to each individual\u2019s treatment of it, in whatever form that may take.\n\nBut the big question (one that I\u2019ve often found myself Googling at 4am after wretching through tears) is: can you ever cure yourself of depression?\n\nWill depression ever completely go away? Can you actually \u2018get rid\u2019 of it for good?\n\nThe general answer seems to be: \u2018no, but you can manage it and it can disappear for a really really long time \u2013 but there\u2019s always a chance of it coming back.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSigh.\n\nDr Kate Mason tells Metro.co.uk: that because depression has such a high risk of recurrence, it\u2019s even more important that you try to treat it as soon as you realise you have it, or think that you could have it.\n\n\u2018The earlier you seek help, the more chance you have of a successful recovery,\u2019 she said. \u2018You may always have a vulnerability to depression but that\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t live a full and meaningful life.\n\n\u2018Through early intervention you can learn ways to manage symptoms before they get too debilitating and help to prevent or lessen some of the major episodes.\n\nDepression can be managed, but different things work for different people (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018A large proportion of people who\u2019ve experienced one major episode of depression are likely to experience at least one other, possibly triggered by major life events that we just can\u2019t avoid.\u2019\n\nHaving previously been in a very, very bad place before, I can personally vouch for depression definitely lessening if it\u2019s given enough attention and treatment. I manage mine with therapy, medication and (occasional) exercise. There are definitely periods when it\u2019s worse and I still have very dark times, but it\u2019s nowhere near as bad as it was when it was a constant thrum of misery.\n\nHolly Stevens, who also has depression, is of a similar opinion that her depression can be managed well but probably not cured.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe tells us: \u2018I know people for whom depression is happily resigned to the past. My completely unscientific anecdotal research, however, is that these are people for whom depression was sparked by an external event, trauma or circumstance.\n\n\u2018While there is an element of that in my case, I also have a strong genetic link (mental illness doesn\u2019t run in my family; it practically gallops, as the memes say) so I suspect my depression cannot be cured as such but the right meds, therapies and lifestyle have eliminated most of my symptoms. So, as long as I maintain the three, I am effectively cured.\u2019\n\nA 2016 study showed that psilocybin (commonly found in magic mushrooms) provided relief from and lessening of depression in a group of patients whose depression had been previously found to be treatment-resistant. This is hugely encouraging, and more studies with psychedelics taken in micro-doses are taking place. In some anec-data about myself, I\u2019ve only taken \u2018shrooms once and they made me feel fantastic and I want some more. It\u2019s thought that psilocybin could become part of prescription medication within the next five years, which is great, but a long, long time if you\u2019re in a black hole. Also, while the treatment sounds promising, it will affect everyone differently and may not work for all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCounsellor Fiona Wright is also in the \u2018perhaps not cured for everyone, but definitely treated and managed for most\u2019 camp. She says: \u2018Depression is unique to the individual and can affect people in many different ways, but there are common symptoms, and it is treatable.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s possible to recover from depression, but sometimes it can be more about learning to manage the symptoms.\n\n\u2018Depression can be managed through medication, therapy and self-care, ideally a combination of these. Medication such as antidepressants or SSRIs can help people move to a place where they can function more effectively, along with other ways of managing symptoms. These drugs are generally safe, but often have side effects.\u2019\n\nAgain, antidepressants will work so differently for everyone. I tried three different types before I found one that worked for me \u2013 as in, gave me the fewest side effects and least misery. Antidepressants don\u2019t make you happy, they make you less sad and less clouded, and can allow you to think more clearly about how you\u2019re going to deal with the mess inside your brain. But they don\u2019t work for everyone.\n\nNothing works for everyone with depression, and everyone will have their different coping tactics. If riding the bus in the front seat and singing the national anthem does it for you, then do that. If therapy makes you feel less awful, then do that. For now, it seems that depression can be relieved for a certain amount of time, at least, and if it comes back then there are options to try to manage it to make your life more bearable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you or a loved one is struggling with mental health, you can find a qualified local counsellor in your area with Counselling Directory.
