Three water tasters undergo the testing each day.\n\nGreta says they have been trained to a high level.\n\n\"During our training we were given several different tasting pills, which we dropped into water so we could train our palates.\n\n\"There were flavours such as musty, rotten vegetables, onion, metallic, earthy, boiled eggs and antiseptic.\n\n\"We are not allowed to do the testing if we have a cold sore or a sore throat and we must not have eaten or smoked an hour before testing.\n\n\"I detected petrol last week in a sample when I sniffed it, so I didn't drink it. It turns out it had come from a private water supply at a cottage.\n\n\"We put an exclamation on the lid in these cases and send them off to public health.\"\n\nSo are they also experts in wine tasting?\n\nGreta said: \"I do like wine but I'm definitely no expert.\"", "description": "Meet the Scottish Water scientists who are the aficionados of our tap water.", "authors": ["Angie Brown", "Bbc Scotland", "Edinburgh", "East Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E0EF/production/_108738575_watertaster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
