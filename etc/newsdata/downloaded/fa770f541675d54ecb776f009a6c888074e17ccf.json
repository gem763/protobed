Now a single swiftly deleted tweet has put all that time and money in jeopardy.\n\nDaryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted an image of a slogan supporting Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters on Friday. That brought a backlash from supporters of the communist government, casting a shadow on what has been one of China\u2019s most popular NBA teams.\n\nChinese sportswear maker Li Ning Co. and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Credit Card Center suspended cooperation with the Rockets, while national broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings Ltd. said they will halt broadcasting the team\u2019s games. Searches for Rockets gear on Chinese e-commerce sites operated by JD.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. didn\u2019t return any results on Monday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nQuick apologies to China and its loyalists from Morey, the Rockets\u2019 ownership and the NBA brought outrage of their own. Texas politicians Julian Castro, Ted Cruz and Beto O\u2019Rourke were among those who tweeted their displeasure with the statements, which included the NBA calling the effect of Morey\u2019s original tweet \u201cregrettable.\u201d\n\nThe NBA is just the latest international business feeling the heat from the standoff between pro-democracy demonstrators and Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-backed authorities that has escalated since June. From Starbucks Corp. to Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., brands and companies have been targeted if they\u2019re seen to be supporting either side in the dispute. But the reaction to the NBA has been more intense as the world of sports gets dragged into the controversy.\n\nRead more on Hong Kong protests:\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough the NBA said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d with Morey\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d comment in a Chinese version of its statement, Commissioner Adam Silver defended the Rockets official\u2019s right to freedom of expression.\n\nAcknowledging the economic impact from the tweet, he told Kyodo News in Japan that as a \u201cvalues-based organization, I want to make it clear that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression.\u201d Those comments sparked further criticism on Chinese social media.\n\nThe league says 800 million people in China watched NBA programming on TV, digital media or smartphones last year, which is nearly 2.5 times the entire population of the U.S. That huge viewership brings with it extensive sales of sponsorships and branded merchandise, the fate of which is in the balance amid the current contretemps.\n\n\u201cThey could lose their business in China,\u201d said Marc Ganis, a sports consultant. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that to happen because the NBA has built up a tremendous amount of goodwill, but they\u2019re going to have to call on those reserves.\u201d\n\nLate 1980s\n\nThe NBA has been making deals in China since the late 1980s, when it agreed to share a portion of advertising revenue in return for games being shown on CCTV. Expansion within the country became a major focus of then-commissioner David Stern, who declined to comment for this article.\n\nThe NBA was the first U.S. sports league to establish a footprint in China, opening a Hong Kong office in 1992, and launched NBA China in 2008. The league now has offices in a handful of Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai.\n\nThe NBA was also the first U.S. league to host games in China -- a pair of 2004 preseason match-ups between the Rockets and the Sacramento Kings. The league has staged more than 20 games in China, with two more scheduled for later this week.\n\nThe NBA has also embraced investment from Chinese businessmen. In 2016, investor Lizhang Jiang became the league\u2019s first Chinese minority owner, buying a small piece of the Minnesota Timberwolves. Joe Tsai, co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, last month became the league\u2019s first Chinese majority owner when he took over the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nEarlier this year, the league extended its partnership with internet giant Tencent, a five-year deal worth a reported $1.5 billion, a threefold increase over the previous deal. Tencent is the league\u2019s largest partner outside the U.S.\n\nThere are also a number of other leaguewide deals, and team-specific deals. Earlier this year, an NBA representative told Bloomberg that the NBA\u2019s business in China has grown at double-digit percentages every year since 2008.\n\nTrade Tensions\n\nWhen trade tensions heated up between China and the U.S., the NBA sought its first head of government and public affairs in China to help shape its \u201cpublic narrative\u201d within the country.\n\nThe Rockets have been among the most popular teams in Asia dating back to the playing career of Yao Ming, a 7-foot-6-inch all-star center who spent his entire eight-year career in Houston. Another former Rockets star, Tracy McGrady, had a successful career in China after leaving the NBA. There\u2019s also a large Chinese-American community in Houston. When the Rockets sold to Tilman Fertitta for a league-record $2.2 billion, a part of that valuation included the team\u2019s popularity in Asia.\n\nYao now runs the Chinese Basketball Association, which said it opposed Morey\u2019s comments and would stop working with the Rockets. In a June interview with Sports Illustrated about Yao\u2019s role with the Chinese basketball league, NBA Commissioner Silver addressed the differences between the U.S. and China.\n\n\u201cHe has obstacles that I don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the Chinese economy has experienced dramatic growth, it\u2019s not a free-enterprise system; the government hand is very strong on all businesses, including sports. He does not have the same economic liberties that a business in the U.S. has.\u201d\n\n(Updates with NBA commissioner\u2019s comments in seventh paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Scott Soshnick and Jinshan Hong.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Eben Novy-Williams in New York at enovywilliam@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, John J.
