Photo: Miramax\n\nThis post is updated twice a month to reflect the latest movies to leave and enter Amazon Prime. *New additions are indicated by an asterisk.\n\nYou really should be using your Amazon Prime subscription for more than just shipping discounts and Whole Foods sales. The people at Amazon have amassed a truly impressive library of films that can be accessed with your Prime account, and in many ways, it\u2019s equal to and arguably even superior to Netflix\u2019s library. But how do you know where to begin? As we have done with Netflix, allow us to present a regularly-updated guide to 100 movies to watch on Amazon Prime. A collection of classics, blockbusters, and under-the-radar flicks, you really should watch all 100. Get back to us after you do.\n\n*12 Monkeys\n\nTerry Gilliam\u2019s sci-fi allegory is one of the visually ambitious director\u2019s best films, a perfect blend of style and daring storytelling. Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, and Brad Pitt star in a story of time travel, betrayal, and even romance. Based loosely on the legendary short La Jet\u00e9e, this is a reminder of how studio films used to take genuine risks. It\u2019s hard to imagine a major company getting behind a movie this strange in 2019.\n\nThe 39 Steps\n\nUntil someone starts Hitchcock+ (get on that, people), there won\u2019t be a streaming service out there that has enough films by the master of suspense. The big three (Hulu, Amazon, Netflix) only have a handful a piece, and Amazon recently added this 1935 classic, named in 2017 by a group of critics as one of the best British films of all time. Robert Donat plays a classic Hitchcock everyman caught up in a web of intrigue and suspense. Don\u2019t miss it.\n\nThe Accused\n\nJodie Foster won her first Oscar for her fearless performance here as a rape victim fighting for justice. When The Accused was released in 1988, Hollywood hadn\u2019t really reckoned with rape and the issues around it like trauma and victim blaming. This movie was brave enough to do so, and it\u2019s anchored by one of the most striking performances of the \u201880s by one of her generation\u2019s best actresses.\n\nThe Act of Killing\n\nThere aren\u2019t many documentaries as difficult to watch as Joshua Oppenheimer\u2019s Oscar-nominated film about not just the Indonesian genocides of the \u201860s but the way its perpetrators haven\u2019t been brought to justice. Oppenheimer films the murderers reenacting their crimes as if they\u2019re in some of their favorite Hollywood movies, and the result is both enlightening and terrifying.\n\nThe African Queen\n\nThere aren\u2019t enough undeniable classics on Amazon, so you should take the chance to watch the few that there are, even if just to fill in your personal viewing history with some movies made before 1980. Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are simply perfect together in this adventure rom-com that should be listed in any film dictionary next to the words star chemistry. Trivia: This is the only movie Bogart won an Oscar for.\n\n*Airplane!\n\nComedies don\u2019t get much funnier than this 1980 smash hit from Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker, a spoof of the disaster genre franchises of the \u201870s. A film that always ranks highly on any list of the best comedies ever made, Airplane! holds up wonderfully as a perfect blend of physical humor and slapstick comedy. Quotable to the extreme, Airplane! is one of those movies people like to say can\u2019t be made today. Check it out to see why.\n\nAnnihilation\n\nParamount notoriously had no idea what to do with Alex Garland\u2019s film and barely promoted it in American theaters, dropping it on Netflix in the rest of the world. In this country, it\u2019s on Amazon. And it\u2019s amazing. One of the best films of 2018 stars Natalie Portman as a woman who enters an alien occurrence to find out what happened to her husband there. Although that barely scratches the surface of this complex, already-beloved film.\n\n*The Apartment\n\nOne of the best comedies of all time is just sitting there on Amazon waiting for you to watch it. Billy Wilder\u2019s Oscar winner for Best Picture and Best Director stars Jack Lemmon as a lowly employee who allows his superiors to use his apartment to have affairs. Sounds dark, right? It is, and that\u2019s only one of the daring things about this 1960 classic that is quite honestly an all-time great.\n\n*Aquirre, the Wrath of God\n\nWerner Herzog was one of the most fearless filmmakers in the world in the prime of his career, and this 1972 period adventure film captures the director at his craziest. Partnered with someone even more off-center than him in Klaus Kinski, the two recount the story of Lope de Aguirre, who lost his mind trying to find El Dorado, the city of gold. And everyone nearly lost their mind making it.\n\n*Bad Lieutenant\n\nAbel Ferrara\u2019s 1992 drama features one of the most fearless performances of its era from Harvey Keitel. Long before monsters were regularly the protagonists of independent films, audiences were shocked by Keitel\u2019s portrayal of an NYPD lieutenant who has gone completely off the rails. Sure, we had edgy cops, but we didn\u2019t have ones who smoked crack while on the job or masturbates in front of teenage girls. This is the kind of insanity that should make for a B-movie, but Ferrara and Keitel elevate it into fine art.\n\nBig Night\n\nAny list of the best \u201cfood movies\u201d ever made that doesn\u2019t include this 1996 dramedy is simply wrong. Co-directed by two men known mostly for their acting \u2014 Campbell Scott and Stanley \u2014 Big Night is a tender movie about a pair of Italian brothers (Tucci and Tony Shalhoub) who own a restaurant in \u201850s New York. As they struggle to keep it afloat, Big Night becomes a heartfelt movie about the immigrant experience and the American Dream.\n\nThe Big Sick\n\nIt\u2019s not common for a breakthrough comedy to be so acclaimed and popular that it actually becomes an Oscar nominee for Best Screenplay, but The Big Sick is not a typical comedy (and Holly Hunter was robbed of a nomination too, by the way). Kumail Nanjiani loosely adapts his own story and does great work alongside Zoe Kazan. It\u2019s really as crowdpleasing as comedies get. You kind of have to be an asshole not to like it.\n\n*Bill & Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure\n\nWith the announcement that Bill & Ted Face the Music is FINALLY coming to theaters next Summer, there\u2019s never been a better time to catch up with one of the best comedies of the \u201880s. Never quite given the credit it should have been as a straight-up brilliant piece of comedy, this one has held up so much better than most of its peers. It\u2019s truly excellent. Wyld Stallyns Forever!\n\n*Blow Out\n\nMost of the films from the peak of Brian De Palma\u2019s career were riffs on Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s best movies and this is the masterful director\u2019s take on Rear Window. John Travolta gives the best performance of his career as a sound effects technician who happens to record a murder. Travolta, Nancy Allen, John Lithgow and Dennis Franz are all great in a movie that\u2019s really about the excess of the era, even though it\u2019s just as powerful today.\n\n*Bringing Out the Dead\n\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s 1999 adaptation of Joe Connelly\u2019s book was widely seen as a critical and commercial disappointment when it was released but has developed a loyal following in the two decades since. Nicolas Cage plays Frank Pierce, a paramedic who has burned out to such a degree that he\u2019s starting to see things. Haunting and moving, the movie surprised people expecting to see the action star version of Cage, but it has really held up. Most Scorsese movies do.\n\nCandyman\n\nYes, that Candyman. Before the remake comes out, revisit the 1992 horror classic, a movie that\u2019s probably a lot better than you remember. Sure, you recall the bees and the urban-legend riff on a boogeyman who appears when you say his name, but did you realize how smart this movie is about social and racial issues? Or how well it uses Chicago as a backdrop? It\u2019s an incredibly effective film that hasn\u2019t just held up over almost 30 years but has actually gotten better with age.\n\nCarrie\n\nStephen King has arguably never been bigger than he is in 2019, with the release of films like Pet Sematary and It: Chapter Two, as well as a new book arriving in the fall. Use this Brian De Palma masterpiece to flash back to a time when King wasn\u2019t yet a household name. Sissy Spacek gives one of her best performances as the title character, a bullied girl who discovers that she\u2019s not your ordinary teenager. This is still one of the best King adaptations of all time.\n\nCharade\n\nWhen Stanley Donen died in February of 2019, most of the obituaries pointed to Singin\u2019 in the Rain and On the Town as the movies for which he would be most remembered, but this thriller has and will stand the test of time too. Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are at their most charismatic, delivering Peter Stone\u2019s witty repartee and elevating a fantastic mystery into a classic.\n\nChildren of a Lesser God\n\nThere was a brief window in the mid-\u201980s when William Hurt was arguably the best working actor. In this film, he plays a new teacher at a school for the deaf, where he meets an outcast named Sarah, played unforgettably by Marlee Matlin, who won an Oscar for her work here. Some of this romantic drama plays a little broad and manipulative, but the performances by Hurt and Matlin carry it.\n\nChinatown\n\nForget it, Jake. One of the essential films of the \u201870s was directed by Roman Polanski and released to rapturous reviews in 1974. (It would have won Best Picture if not for a little movie called The Godfather, Part II.) Jack Nicholson stars as Jake Gittes, a private eye who gets involved in the California water wars of the \u201830s. Polanski uses a noir structure to get at something deeper about corruption and poison in the entire system. It\u2019s a masterpiece.\n\nCloverfield\n\nMatt Reeves\u2019s 2008 found-footage monster movie was a major event, something that helped redefine how films are sold to audiences. We only saw glimpses of the monster in commercials and previews (and even in the movie itself), and the result was a massive hit, making over $170 million worldwide and launching a franchise. See where it all began.\n\nThe Conversation\n\nArguably the best performance of Gene Hackman\u2019s career resides in this Francis Ford Coppola masterpiece. Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert in San Francisco who gets embroiled in a job that amplifies his already-high paranoia. One of the best films of the \u201870s, Coppola actually released this the same year as The Godfather, Part II.\n\nDead Ringers\n\nWe don\u2019t deserve David Cronenberg. One of the best living filmmakers delivered one of his best films in 1988 in this twisted thriller starring Jeremy Irons as twin gynecologists who share flings with their clients without them knowing. Well, they do until one of them develops an attachment to the latest patient. Creepy and masterful, this contains arguably Irons\u2019 best performance.\n\nThe Dead Zone\n\nStephen King is everywhere lately from Pet Sematary to It to Castle Rock. Why not revisit one of the more successful adaptations of his work from the \u201880s? Christopher Walken stars as a man who can learn a person\u2019s secrets just by touching them. For most people, this probably wouldn\u2019t be that big a deal, but then he makes contact with a Senator (Martin Sheen) running for President and\u2026well, see for yourself. It\u2019s a little dated but still a fun movie.\n\nDear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father\n\nYou know all those true crime docs that you can\u2019t stop watching on Netflix and HBO? Most of them aren\u2019t as good as Kurt Kuenne\u2019s heartbreaker about his friend Andrew Bagby. After Andrew died, Kurt decided to make a movie about his buddy for the son that would never get to know his father. What began as a project for a friend and his family became a word-of-mouth indie hit with a twist so devastating that most people can\u2019t talk about it without crying.\n\nDiabolique\n\nThere\u2019s an apocryphal story that goes that Alfred Hitchcock made Psycho because he wanted to make a movie as scary as Henri-Georges Clouzot\u2019s Diabolique. You\u2019ve probably seen the story of Norman Bates. Shouldn\u2019t you see the brilliant French thriller that inspired it into existence?\n\nDistrict 9\n\nSharlto Copley stars in Neill Blomkamp\u2019s wildly successful sleeper hit, a movie that really came out of nowhere to become one of the biggest film stories of 2009. Sci-fi movies with no stars from debut directors don\u2019t usually go on to become Best Picture nominees, but District 9 is not your typical sci-fi movie.\n\nDressed to Kill\n\nThere are elements of Brian De Palma\u2019s thriller that haven\u2019t exactly aged well in terms of the way it treats gender issues, but it\u2019s impossible to deny the strength of the suspense master\u2019s display of craft here. Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, and Nancy Allen star in a film that feels like De Palma\u2019s riff on Psycho with more style than nearly any other BDP film \u2013 you can decide if that\u2019s a good or bad thing.\n\n*Dumb and Dumber\n\nSometimes you want highbrow adult fare; sometimes you want to watch a couple of beautiful idiots. Look down on one of Jim Carrey\u2019s best movies all you want from your ivory tower, but this comedy has held up brilliantly. Physical humor transcends generations, and you won\u2019t find two physical comedy performances much better than Carrey and Jeff Daniels here.\n\nEighth Grade\n\nBo Burnham\u2019s feature film debut won him multiple awards last year and it\u2019s already on Amazon Prime for you to see what all the fuss is about. Elsie Fisher gives a breakthrough performance as a young lady who makes YouTube videos that pretty much only she sees and struggles her way through the most socially awkward years of existence. Smart, moving, and incredibly clever, this is a great comedy that rings of enough truth that it hurts.\n\nFirst Reformed\n\nEthan Hawke stars in Paul Schrader\u2019s best film in a generation. Hawke stars as a small-town priest confronted with a crisis of faith when he meets a man who teaches him about the evil of environmental poisoning. Would God really let his planet be destroyed? This crisis hits head on with health problems and the result is one of the smartest screenplays of 2018 and arguably its best performance, period.\n\nFitzcarraldo\n\nWerner Herzog set out to make a movie about a man who was insane enough to try and move a steamship over land from one river to another and Herzog himself was insane enough to actually try and replicate it. The result is a film that\u2019s mesmerizing in its detail and blatant in its study of power gone mad, both in the narrative and the filmmaking. Watch Burden of Dreams after \u2013 a great doc about the crazy making of this film. (It\u2019s on Prime too.)\n\nThe Florida Project\n\nSean Baker\u2019s study of a mother and daughter on a low run of the social ladder in a Florida motel is a riveting blend of character study and magical realism. It has a sense of wonder that reflects its unforgettable child leading lady without ever pandering to her or looking down on its subjects. It\u2019s heartbreaking and beautiful, one of the best films of the \u201810s.\n\nGangs of New York\n\nMartin Scorsese films from this century don\u2019t get the same adoration as his classics from the last one. There\u2019s even a sense in some circles that he sold out in some way (a silly charge if you look at the passion that still drives his choices). While this may not be a classic when compared to other Scorsese films, it\u2019s still a great movie, anchored by yet another masterful turn from Daniel Day-Lewis.\n\nA Ghost Story\n\nIt may not be a movie for everyone, but those who love David Lowery\u2019s meditation on loss really love it. Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck star in a film that\u2019s incredibly difficult to sum up in a few sentences. It\u2019s about time, grief, and the afterlife, but not in a way that you\u2019ve ever seen before. Just watch it.\n\n*Goldeneye\n\nAmazon Prime members of a certain age will remember that James Bond was in a bit of a dire place in the late \u201880s and early \u201890s. The Roger Moore era went out with a whimper and Timothy Dalton didn\u2019t really work for movie goers. So this first Pierce Brosnan vehicle was a comeback for 007, and what a fun, glorious, underrated comeback it was. This is not only one of the best Bond movies, it\u2019s one of the best action movies of the \u201890s.\n\nThe Handmaiden\n\nNone of the streaming services have a truly deep selection of international cinema but Amazon Prime is better than most. Take for example Park Chan-wook\u2019s masterful period drama about betrayal, sex, and more betrayal. It\u2019s one of the most technically gorgeous films you could possibly watch tonight. Make sure the kids are in bed first though.\n\nHeathers\n\nChristian Slater kinda does a Jack Nicholson impression and Winona Ryder is at the peak of her \u201880s emo-charm in this clever satire of high school life. Ryder plays the high school outcast and Slater plays the guy who teaches revenge is a dish best served with an attitude.\n\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\n\nJohn McNaughton\u2019s document of the life of a serial killer and his new also-homicidal friend is one of the best independent films of its generation. Not only does it use a dark, rarely seen side of Chicago brilliantly, but its balance of horror and even humor remains powerful three decades later.\n\nHereditary\n\nMake sure you\u2019re in the right mental place before watching Ari Aster\u2019s 2018 debut film, a movie that will rattle you to your core. Toni Collette gives one of the best performances of 2018 as a mother who faces tragic loss before she faces something much scarier. It\u2019s unforgettable.\n\nHigh Noon\n\nAny list of the most influential movies of all time that doesn\u2019t include Fred Zinneman\u2019s 1952 Western classic is simply incomplete. Gary Cooper won an Oscar for a performance that would redefine square-jawed, American grit, and the final scenes of this movie have been mimicked ever since.\n\nHis Girl Friday\n\nWhen people think of the most influential Hollywood comedies of all time, this 1940 Howard Hawks hit often makes the list. Watch it to see why. You\u2019ll witness Cary Grant at his most charismatic as Walter Burns, an editor who is watching his best reporter and ex-wife walk out the door. He suggests they cover one last story, and Hollywood magic ensues. American movies don\u2019t get much more classic than this.\n\nHoop Dreams\n\nThe selection of high-quality docs on streaming services are more limited than one would like (there are a lot of them, but not necessarily the best). However, Amazon does feature one of the best non-fiction films of all time, Steve James\u2019 examination of two young men on the South Side of Chicago and their aspirations to be NBA stars. It\u2019s the kind of deeply humanist storytelling that James makes look it easy when it\u2019s really not.\n\n*Hoosiers\n\nAny list of crowd-pleasing sports movies that doesn\u2019t include this 1986 smash hit is incomplete. The true story of a small-town Indiana high school basketball team that won the state championship stars Gene Hackman as the new coach, and co-stars Barbara Hershey and Dennis Hopper, who landed the only acting Oscar nomination of his career for his great work here.\n\nHugo\n\nMartin Scorsese adapts Brian Selznick\u2019s The Invention of Hugo Cabret in for this beautiful 2011 family film, a flick nominated for 11 Academy Awards (and winner of five). This is one to watch on the biggest TV in the house. You probably can\u2019t replicate the experience of Scorsese\u2019s foray into 3D but this is a movie that needs to be watched as big as possible to appreciate its vision and technical craftsmanship.\n\nHustle & Flow\n\nLong before Empire, this was the breakthrough for Terence Howard and Taraji P. Henson. Craig Brewer\u2019s story of a pimp turned hip-hop artist pulses with an energy and authenticity often missing from these films. And a song called \u201cIt\u2019s Hard Out Here for a Pimp\u201d won an Oscar! Let that sink in.\n\nIn the Heat of the Night\n\nFifty years before Green Book won Best Picture, a very different portrait of race relations in the South took home that same prize. Sidney Poitier stars as a black officer who gets caught up in a murder case, and Rod Steiger plays his white counterpart. Both men are breathtakingly good, and the film contains one of cinema\u2019s most notable slaps.\n\nInside Llewyn Davis\n\nHave we started to take the Coen brothers for granted? The Oscar winners hit home runs every single time, but their recent output doesn\u2019t seem to garner the attention that every one of their new releases once did. Take this music masterpiece, a film that unfolds like a great lost folk album and contains so-far-career-best work from Oscar Isaac. It\u2019s one of the best movies of the last decade, much less on Amazon.\n\nIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\n\nFrank Capra\u2019s classic often gets a ton of replay around the holidays, but it\u2019s the kind of heartwarmer that works all year long. This is no mere Christmas movie but a story about the impact that one man can have on an entire community. It really defined the on-screen persona of Jimmy Stewart and has become a beloved film around the world, even in warm weather.\n\n*The Killing\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen the \u201cgreatest hits\u201d of Stanley Kubrick like 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining, but he directed a number of great films before becoming a household name. Take this 1956 noir (with dialogue by the great Jim Thompson) that stars Sterling Hayden as a newly-released convict sucked into a heist at a racetrack. It\u2019s a great film.\n\nThe King of Comedy\n\nMartin Scorsese is often more recognized for his gangster movies, classics like GoodFellas and Casino, but he\u2019s a filmmaker who can do absolutely everything. One of his most underrated genre experiments is this prescient 1982 black comedy about everyone wanting their 15 minutes of fame. Robert De Niro gives an unforgettable performance as Rupert Pupkin, an unhinged stand-up comedian who becomes obsessed with a talk-show host, played by Jerry Lewis.\n\nLady Bird\n\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s Oscar nominee is one of the most personal and striking coming-of-age films in years. Saoirse Ronan stars as the titular character, a young Californian who longs for someplace cooler than her own hometown. It\u2019s a heartfelt and very smart film, buoyed by great performances throughout, including Ronan, Tracy Letts, Timothee Chalamet, Lucas Hedges, Beanie Feldstein, and Laurie Metcalf, who was robbed of that Oscar.\n\nLast House on the Left\n\nWe can\u2019t really be shocked anymore in the same manner that audiences were when they saw Wes Craven\u2019s 1972 debut. Based on Ingmar Bergman\u2019s The Virgin Spring, this low-budget horror classic remains a brutally shocking and effective thriller.\n\n*The Last Waltz\n\nAny list of the best concert films of all time that doesn\u2019t included Martin Scorsese\u2019s 1978 masterpiece about the final performance of the legendary group The Band in late 1976. It\u2019s a perfectly constructed ode to creativity and musical passion, featuring appearances by Eric Clapton, Robbie Robertson, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Ringo Starr, and Dr. John.\n\nLeave No Trace\n\nOne of the best films of 2018, Debra Granik\u2019s return to filmmaking stars Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie and Ben Foster as a daughter and father who live way off the grid. His PTSD doesn\u2019t allow him to live in traditional settings, but he can sense that his daughter is pulling away from him and ready to live in the society he has shunned.\n\nLeaving Las Vegas\n\nRemember when Nicolas Cage won an Oscar? Believe it or not, the actor now known mostly for his \u201cextreme\u201d acting choices gave one of the most subtle performances of the \u201890s in this Mike Figgis film, which won Cage the Academy Award. He plays Ben Sanderson, a screenwriter so in the grip of alcoholism that he goes to Las Vegas with the plan to drink himself to death. There he meets Sera (Elizabeth Shue), a hooker with a heart of gold who gives him a reason to live.\n\nThe Lost City of Z\n\nJames Gray may be the most underrated American filmmaker what with The Immigrant, Two Lovers, and his latest, this period piece about obsession starring Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson. This is not your typical explorer movie as Gray seeks to present something more challenging about why men seek the unexplored and commit themselves long past the point of sanity to seemingly impossible tasks.\n\nThe Machinist\n\nEven people who have never seen this movie know the story of how Christian Bale nearly killed himself with weight loss to make it all the more harrowing. Bale stars as Trevor Reznik, an insomniac who spirals into complete madness. Brad Anderson is the best director you probably don\u2019t know by name and this is one of his best films, anchored by the complete commitment of its leading man.\n\nManchester by the Sea\n\nCasey Affleck won an Oscar for his heartbreaking performance in Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s drama about a broken man finally put back together when he\u2019s forced to take care of his nephew. Lonergan\u2019s film is an unforgettable character study, full of complex emotions and beats. And it has two scenes that are almost guaranteed to make you cry.\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate\n\nJohn Frankenheimer\u2019s beloved 1962 adaptation of the 1959 novel of the same name has become such a part of the national consciousness that one can reference its title in political conversations and be completely understood. If you somehow have never seen it, Frank Sinatra stars as a Korean vet who may be a sleeper agent for enemies of the United States. It has held up better than nearly any other film from its era.\n\nMemories of Murder\n\nBong Joon-ho has become an internationally renowned filmmaker with movies like The Host, Snowpiercer, and Okja, but arguably his best film has yet to really find an audience because it doesn\u2019t have a U.S. Blu-ray release. How wonderful that you can still watch what could be called \u201cKorean Zodiac\u201d on Amazon. It\u2019s a riveting study of two cops who become obsessed with a true serial killer.\n\nThe Messenger\n\nThere\u2019s still a weird belief that Woody Harrelson is better at comedy than drama, even using the former to shade roles like that in Three Billboard Outside Ebbing, Missouri. However, Woody kills it when he goes deeply dramatic too as in this Oren Moverman drama about the men who tell loved ones that soldiers have died in combat. Ben Foster is incredible here too.\n\n*Mission: Impossible Fallout\n\nTom Cruise\u2019s latest adventure as Ethan Hunt may actually be his best. It\u2019s certainly one of the best action movies of the last couple years, and it\u2019s already available on streaming services! Sure, you\u2019ve read a lot about how Cruise does his own stunts (which is impressive), but watch this for a master class in action film editing too. The film hums and moves in ways that other action movies just don\u2019t. It\u2019s as wildly entertaining as anything you\u2019ll find on Amazon Prime.\n\nMother!\n\nDarren Aronofsky talked someone at Paramount into letting him make the strangest and most ambitious studio film in years. Jennifer Lawrence stars in the movie that notoriously angered audiences when it was released in theaters, but this movie has a loyal fan base for a reason and it seems to be growing. It\u2019s crazy, and we mean that in a good way. If only more studios made more crazy movies.\n\nMud\n\nA key entry in the McConaughaissance is this 2012 coming-of-age thriller from the great Jeff Nichols. McConaughey stars as the title character, someone living way off the grid who is discovered by two local boys in the Deep South. He\u2019s hiding out, waiting for his gal, played by Reese Witherspoon. Sam Shepard, Sarah Paulson, and Michael Shannon add flavor to a great supporting cast.\n\nMurder on the Orient Express\n\nLong before Kenneth Branagh resurrected Agatha Christie\u2019s beloved detective Hercule Poirot for a new generation, Sidney Lumet gathered a cast of all-stars to adapt one of the suspense master\u2019s most beloved novels. You think the 2017 version had an impressive cast? Check out the \u201870s version, with Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Perkins, and more. It\u2019s held up wonderfully.\n\nThe Neon Demon\n\nNo one makes movies quite like Nicolas Winding Refn. The director of Drive delivered one of his most unforgettable flicks in this horror film about the fashion industry, featuring a fearless performance by Elle Fanning. And Keanu Reeves is in it too!\n\nParadise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills\n\nHave you heard of the West Memphis Three? You won\u2019t forget them after you watch this 1996 HBO documentary about a trio of boys accused of a horrific murder in 1993. Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky followed this case so closely that they produced two sequels to this doc (in 2000 and 2011), both of which are also on Prime. Marathon!\n\nPaterson\n\nJim Jarmusch\u2019s best film is also his most recent, and it\u2019s on Prime! The indie auteur finds one of his best mouthpieces in Adam Driver\u2019s Paterson, a bus driver who moonlights as a poet. Gentle, beautiful, and unforgettable, it\u2019s a movie that honestly captures how easy it is to find poetry in everyday life without ever being as cheesy as that description sounds like it could be.\n\nThe Proposition\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of great Westerns on Amazon, but this modern one is worth your time. John Hillcoat directs a gritty, vicious script by Nick Cave (of The Bad Seeds fame) and draws excellent performances from a cast that includes Guy Pearce, Ray Winstone, Emily Watson, John Hurt, and a movie-stealing Danny Huston. With riveting cinematography by Benoit Delhomme, this is a Western that looks phenomenal, unfolding like a visualization of one of Cave\u2019s albums.\n\nA Quiet Place\n\nWho could have possibly guessed that Jim from The Office would be behind one of the most successful horror films of the \u201810s? Or that it would be on streaming services only a year after its release? You\u2019ve probably already seen it, this story of a world in which silence is the only way to survive, but it\u2019s worth another look to marvel at its tight, taut filmmaking and a stellar performance from Emily Blunt. This one is going to age well.\n\nRain Man\n\nOne of the most character-driven Best Picture winners of all time, Barry Levinson\u2019s 1988 drama won out in part because it was a relatively weak year but more so because of how people completely fell in love with Dustin Hoffman\u2019s performance as Raymond, an autistic savant partnered with his previously unknown brother, played by Tom Cruise. It\u2019s a gentle humanist drama that sometimes veers into melodrama, but the two leads bring it back to something grounded and genuine.\n\nRomeo Is Bleeding\n\nThe most underrated performance in Gary Oldman\u2019s career is in this 1993 Peter Medak neo-noir thriller, a movie that far too few people have seen. Oldman plays the kind of anti-hero we didn\u2019t see much in the early \u201990s (but do all the time now) \u2013 a corrupt cop caught up in a web of lies and dangerous women. Oldman is great, but the movie is stolen by its powerful female cast, including Lena Olin, Annabella Sciorra, and Juliette Lewis. The great ensemble also includes Roy Scheider, Michael Wincott, Will Patton, James Cromwell, and Ron Perlman. Yeah, you want to see that.\n\nRonin\n\nAny list of the best car-chase movies that doesn\u2019t include John Frankenheimer\u2019s 1998 action flick is simply wrong. Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, and Sean Bean star in this David Mamet\u2013scripted thriller about a team of operatives with a habit of betraying one another. The story is secondary to the stunt work, which includes some of the best choreographed and shot car-chase sequences of all time. Your pulse will race. We guarantee it.\n\n*Rosemary\u2019s Baby\n\nEveryone talking about the arrival of elevated horror on the scene as if Get Out and Hereditary were the first of the genre to be taken seriously must not remember the \u201870s, when movies as dark and vicious as Rosemary\u2019s Baby won Oscars and made millions. Roman Polanski\u2019s adaptation of Ira Levin\u2019s novel has lost none of its terrifying power, thanks in large part to the phenomenal work by Mia Farrow, who makes Rosemary\u2019s predicament palpable.\n\nThe Running Man\n\nThis one is peak Ah-nuld. Is it a great movie? Maybe not, but they can\u2019t all be Oscar winners. Sometimes you\u2019re more in the mood to watch the biggest action star in the world survive a homicidal TV show in a dystopian future than anything serious.\n\nShivers\n\nDavid Cronenberg became widely known for movies you\u2019ve probably seen like The Fly and Eastern Promises, but maybe you never caught his twisted 1975 horror film about alien parasites that work their way through the residents of an average apartment complex. With his focus on body horror and buckets of blood, this one still has the power to shock. It was shot under the title Orgy of the Blood Parasites. Who doesn\u2019t want to see that?\n\nThe Shootist\n\nEvery once in awhile a film comes along that deconstructs not just a character but the career of a performer. Think Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven or Robert Redford in Old Man & the Gun. John Wayne has a couple of these fascinating deconstructions, especially his final film, this 1976 Don Siegel Western about an over-the-hill shootist in his final days. Wayne co-stars with Lauren Bacall, Ron Howard, James Stewart, John Carradine and more in his final classic.\n\nShutter Island\n\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s adaptation of Dennis Lehane\u2019s best novel is a perfect example of one of those movies in which people have just started taking a master filmmaker\u2019s skills for granted. Who else could have directed such a technically precise and visually striking film as Marty did here? And who could have drawn one of the best performances of Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s career but his favorite collaborator? People seem to be coming back to this film and agreeing we underrated it when it came out. Join the chorus.\n\nA Simple Plan\n\nSam Raimi directs a dramatic thriller that\u2019s not exactly like the horror and superhero films for which he is primarily known. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton star as Minnesotan brothers who find a plane crash with $4.4 million in cash. They take the money and, well, things go wrong from there. It\u2019s a fantastic thriller with a \u201cwhat if\u201d premise about what you would do in the same situation.\n\nSixteen Candles\n\nJohn Hughes defined a generation with his look at teenage life in the Chicago suburbs, and this remains one of his most beloved films (even if some of its humor hasn\u2019t aged well). Like a lot of Hughes movies, there\u2019s something so likable and buoyant about Sixteen Candles, especially in the central performance from Molly Ringwald (not to mention the great Joan Cusack). Like Pretty in Pink, it\u2019s kind of a time machine to your childhood. (Or to your mom\u2019s childhood.)\n\n*Sleepy Hollow\n\nIs this the last great Tim Burton movie? This 1999 Johnny Depp flick was the perfect distillation of both Burton and his favorite star\u2019s interests, allowing both to display their love for the dark side in a big-budget adaptation of Washington Irving\u2019s classic short story. Depp plays Ichabod Crane, who investigates a series of murders allegedly committed by a headless horseman. Stylish and creepy, it\u2019s a film of its era that\u2019s held up remarkably well.\n\nSome Like It Hot\n\nOne of the best comedies ever made. It\u2019s as simple as that. When someone in your life is struggling to watch anything made before 1990, introduce them to this Billy Wilder classic, a movie that is so good that it works as a gateway drug to classic cinema. It may have been made in 1959, but the perfect performances by Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe, as well as Wilder\u2019s masterful timing, mean that it\u2019s just as funny as it was six decades ago.\n\nSophie\u2019s Choice\n\nMeryl Streep won her second Oscar for this heartbreaking adaptation of William Styron\u2019s novel. Everyone remembers the unforgettable scene to which the title of this film refers, but there\u2019s more to this movie than just that impossible decision. It\u2019s as much about the impact of war and trauma as it is the events themselves, and Streep\u2019s landmark work is ably supported by Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol.\n\nSpotlight\n\nAs the industry known as journalism faces daily attacks from the White House itself, it may be a good time to be reminded of the power of a team of reporters who are undaunted when it comes to getting the story. This true tale of Boston journalists who exposed not just rampant abuse but cover-ups within the Catholic Church is both shocking in what it exposes and inspiring in how it captures the importance of what talented people can accomplish when they\u2019re motivated to do their jobs well.\n\nThe Squid and the Whale\n\nNoah Baumbach\u2019s personal 2005 drama dissects the impact of divorce on an average family and offers the suggestion that the flaws of parents will only be amplified in their children. Jeff Daniels, Laura Linney, and Jesse Eisenberg all give excellent performances in a film that feels both specifically revealing and universal in its themes.\n\nStar Trek\n\nJ.J. Abrams successfully resurrected the then-dead film arc of the U.S.S. Enterprise with this fun, clever blockbuster that reboots the entire original series. Stepping into William Shatner\u2019s shoes, Chris Pine proves an able leading man, and the supporting cast is underrated in its greatness, including John Cho, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, Anton Yelchin, and more. Both sequels \u2013 Star Trek Into Darkness and Star Trek Beyond \u2013 are also on Prime.\n\nStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\n\nKhaaaannnnnn! Unless you\u2019re of the right age, it\u2019s hard to understand what a phenomenon this movie became as it completely redefined the entire Star Trek franchise. The stories of Captain Kirk and the USS Enterprise were always relatively benign (people forget the first movie was rated G!), but then this dark, twisted adventure story came along and proved that this world could be just as rich and daring as the one created by George Lucas. It\u2019s a genre classic \u2014 and still the best Star Trek movie.\n\nStop Making Sense\n\nThis might be the best concert movie ever made. Jonathan Demme doesn\u2019t just film a Talking Heads performance, he makes a film that truly conveys how special they were as musicians and on-stage. Opening up more with each song, this film becomes a joyous expression of creativity.\n\nThe Sweet Hereafter\n\nIf you don\u2019t know the name Atom Egoyan, you really should fix that oversight in your viewing history. He\u2019s made some more challenging films than this one (Exotica, Felicia\u2019s Journey) but this film remains his best, an emotionally devastating adaptation of Russell Banks\u2019 novel about a horrific bus accident that kills numerous children. How something that awful tears an entire community apart is handled with complexity and grace.\n\n*The Terminator\n\nJames Cameron\u2019s sci-fi/action game-changer is one of those films that has become such an iconic part of \u201880s movie history that even people who haven\u2019t seen it quote and GIF it. Why not actually go back and watch the film that altered sci-fi history and made Ah-nuld a star? The superior Judgment Day isn\u2019t on Prime, but you should really own that one already anyway.\n\n*Thief\n\nLong before he made Heat and The Insider, Michael Mann had the directorial goods in his feature film debut, a thriller that not only includes one of the best performances of James Caan\u2019s career but the gorgeous visual craftsmanship that would define Mann\u2019s career. Caan plays a safecracker who gets sucked into one final job, which, of course, doesn\u2019t go as planned. It\u2019s a beautiful, meditative look into the criminal underworld that finds some of the macho poetry that would become such a big part of the Mann aesthetic.\n\nThelma & Louise\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been almost three decades since Thelma & Louise took over the national conversation and the Academy Awards. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis give two of the best performances of their careers in this unforgettable story of an assault that sends two women on a fateful road trip. Everything about this movie works better than you remember, particularly the performances from its two stars.\n\nTranssiberian\n\nAnother under-the-radar film you may not have seen, this 2008 Brad Anderson thriller owes a great deal to Hitchcock in the way it captures average people caught up in a very not-average situation. Woody Harrelson, Kate Mara, and Emily Mortimer star in a movie for which it\u2019s truly best if you know as little as possible going in. International train travel and mystery \u2013 what more do you want to know?\n\nThe Virgin Suicides\n\nSofia Coppola made her directorial debut with this adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides\u2019s beloved novel about a group of sisters who captivated the entire neighborhood in which they lived. Kirsten Dunst anchors a dreamy, enchanting movie about the myth of perfection that exists in the world of picket fences in Middle America. It\u2019s got a great Air soundtrack too.\n\nWanderlust\n\nSure, maybe this isn\u2019t a great movie, but there\u2019s not a lot of mainstream comedy on Amazon worth recommending, and sometimes you just need a way to check out. This vehicle for Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston should fit the bill. David Wain of Wet Hot American Summer fame directs the story of a city couple who end up living in a commune in Georgia. Rudd\u2019s prodigious charisma anchors the film, but he\u2019s ably assisted by a supporting cast that includes Justin Theroux, Malin Akerman, Kathryn Hahn, and even Alan Alda.\n\nWest Side Story\n\nAs the high-profile remake of this classic ramps up production, do yourself a favor and check out one of the most beloved movie musicals of all time. The 1961 adaptation of the 1957 Broadway hit won 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. A riff on Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo & Juliet, this is a joyous, vibrant film that really helped shape the form of the movie musical in the \u201860s and \u201870s. It\u2019s a must-see.\n\nWhale Rider\n\nIf there was any cinematic justice in the world, Whale Rider would have made Niki Caro and Keisha Castle-Hughes into household names. This is one of those movies that everyone who has seen it loves \u2013 it\u2019s just not enough people have seen it. Castle-Hughes stars as a 12-year-old who wants to be the leader of her tribe, a role that has been filled by only men for generations. Castle-Hughes is so genuine that she was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress (the youngest at the time to ever be nominated) and the story of female empowerment remains timely. After the little girl in your house sees Captain Marvel, introduce her to another kind of hero.\n\nYou Were Never Really Here\n\nJoaquin Phoenix stars in Lynne Ramsay\u2019s technically masterful deconstruction of the life of a hitman. Ramsay\u2019s amazing skill with editing and sound design is balanced by Phoenix\u2019s instinctual, almost primal performance. When he\u2019s asked to save the daughter of a prominent politician from sex trafficking, his life comes apart. Well, what little life he had left. This is riveting filmmaking and Phoenix\u2019s work is one of the best performances of 2018.", "description": "The best movies streaming on Amazon Prime include Gangs of New York, Raging Bull, The Virgin Suicides, Lady Bird, and many more.
