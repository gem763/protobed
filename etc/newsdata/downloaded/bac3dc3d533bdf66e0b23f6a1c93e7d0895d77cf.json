It\u2019s a grand slam. There is lots of pressure, lots of expectations from people. But you also put lots of pressure on yourself.\n\n\u201cYou have to just go out there, do your job and don\u2019t think too much what\u2019s going on around you, and who handle it the best wins.\n\n\u201cDefinitely it\u2019s a big challenge to play against her. Obviously Serena is amazing champion. It\u2019s probably it\u2019s going to be really tough against her.\u201d", "description": "Serena Williams dropped just one game as she blew China\u2019s Wang Qiang away 6-1, 6-0 in well under an hour to move into the semi-finals of the US Open", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eded94011d20ffe1cc9bef327e26edc97fcd3cf/0_0_3783_2271/master/3783.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=63b0d95864789b0cbf449dfca182253a"}
