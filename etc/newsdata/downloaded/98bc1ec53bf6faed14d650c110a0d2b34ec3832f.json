The Fed said it would lower its benchmark overnight lending rate to a target range of 1.75% to 2%, from 2% to 2.25%.\n\n\"Fed funds and the 10-year is still inverted,\" Siegel said. \"We should bring down that fed funds rate at least another 25 basis points. ... We got to normalize the curve.\"\n\nThe Fed was divided in its decision to lower rates Wednesday, with three officials dissenting. Central bank officials are also split on further action this year. U.S. stocks closed little changed after the central bank failed to signal it will cut rates again in 2019.\n\n\"What the Fed's telling you is this is risk management. They want to bring down rates a little bit but they ultimately see the economy as being in good shape,\" said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.\n\nSiegel doesn't expect that there will be a recession but said that there will be a \"significant slowdown.\" He cited FedEx's pessimism about the global economy on the delivery giant's post-earnings conference call with analysts as a reason to be concerned.\n\nThe Fed can avoid that with one more rate cut, he said.\n\n\"I know some of the [economic] data has been decent,\" Siegel said.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.", "description": "\"I agree completely with\" St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who has advocated for a 50 basis point cut, Siegel says.", "authors": ["Berkeley Lovelace Jr."], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105609533-1544038057814gettyimages-959302608.jpeg?v=1568841576", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
