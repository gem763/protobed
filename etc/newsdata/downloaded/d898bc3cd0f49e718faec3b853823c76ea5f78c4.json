I had Ribas taking this one, because I think she's a more complete MMA fighter. There's a difference between being critical and being an asshole. \u2014 Fernanda Prates (@NandaPrates_) October 13, 2019\n\n@MackenzieDern Great fight so far from both ladies- but win or lose- I\u2019m proud of that girl!
