(AP) - For Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Miami Dolphins, a last-second defeat meant progress.\n\nMiami lost 17-16 to the Washington Redskins on Sunday when Fitzpatrick\u2019s 2-point conversion pass was dropped in the flat by running back Kenyan Drake.\n\nThe Dolphins (0-5) remained winless under rookie coach Brian Flores, while the Redskins (1-5) earned their first victory.\n\nStill, it could have been worse - and often has been for the 2019 Dolphins.\n\n\u201cMoral victory - I don\u2019t know if we believe in those,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cBut it\u2019s much more fun to be involved in a game like this than one when you look up and you\u2019re losing by 40-plus points.\u201d\n\nIn succession the Dolphins have been beaten by 49 points, 43, 25, 20 and 1. The latest loss was a close call because of Fitzpatrick, who replaced Josh Rosen at the start of the fourth quarter with Miami trailing 17-3.\n\nRosen will remain the starter, however, Flores said.\n\nFitzpatrick - known as FitzMagic because of his knack for the improbable even as a journeyman - led touchdown marches of 55 and 75 yards, with the second drive coming in the final 2:02. He threw for 132 yards in one quarter, with no sacks or interceptions, while Rosen threw for 85 yards in three quarters, with five sacks and two interceptions.\n\nRosen had no quarrel with being yanked by Flores.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely got to get better,\u201d Rosen said. \u2018Flo\u2019s\u2018 job first and foremost is to win football games and I respect the decision. It\u2019s my job to not put him in that position.\u201d\n\nFlores switched from Fitzpatrick to Rosen as his No. 1 QB after Week 2, but doesn\u2019t plan another switch. He and the Dolphins want to find out whether Rosen is a potential franchise quarterback.\n\n\u201cJosh will continue to be the starter,\u201d Flores said. \u201cIf we need that spark, Fitz has to go in.\u201d\n\nNeither Rosen, 22, nor Fitzpatrick, 36, has any complaint about how Flores is handling the quarterback situation.\n\n\u201cAbove my pay grade,\u201d Rosen said.\n\n\u201cWhatever my role is, I\u2019m going to try to do it to the best of my ability,\u201d Fitzpatrick said.\n\nIn Rosen\u2019s defense, pass protection was awful when he was in the game. The Dolphins went into their two-minute offense with Fitzpatrick, and the Redskins dialed back their pass rush.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an experienced vet - a salty, savvy veteran coming in late in the game,\u201d Redskins interim coach Bill Callahan said. \u201cHe came in there very cool and proceeded to obviously take advantage of some of our coverages.\u201d\n\nThe Dolphins\u2018 touchdowns were only their third and fourth this season, and their first points after halftime all year. From the sideline, Rosen applauded the increase in productivity.\n\n\u201cAs a team, this is a step in the right direction,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cPersonally, I may not say the same. Take it on the chin and continue to improve.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Miami Dolphins, a last-second defeat meant progress.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steven Wine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/redskins_dolphins_football_63515_c0-152-3641-2275_s1200x700.jpg?415063eec54c2c7f34e92d9db04c815812bc28b2", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
