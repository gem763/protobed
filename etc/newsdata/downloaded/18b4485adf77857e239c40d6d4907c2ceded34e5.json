But there is no real deadline for those talks, and with the Santiago summit off the calendar, it is not clear when the phase-one deal will be finalised.\n\nTrump had not planned to attend the environmental summit in Chile, though a US delegation was expected.\n\nThe White House also announced Wednesday that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross would lead the US delegation to the East Asia Summit and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations gathering in Bangkok next week. Trump has not attended those events since 2017.\n\nLeaders from around the world had planned to gather in Chile for the COP to continue a push to ramp up efforts to sharply cut carbon emissions in coming years and to meet the goals of the landmark Paris climate accord, which was signed in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeen climate activist Greta Thunberg had planned to speak at the conference, once again chiding world leaders to act with more urgency. Trump is also expected to give official notice soon that the United States is withdrawing from the Paris accord next year, and delegates to the summit would have been forced to wrestle with that reality.\n\nNow, questions remain about how many nations will be prepared to meaningfully increase their pledges to take more aggressive climate action ahead of 2020 - the date when the Paris agreement said countries must make a new round of promises.\n\nThe United Nations, which oversees the annual gathering, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Presidents DonaldTrump and Xi Jinping were scheduled to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Santiago from November 15 to 17.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cc774ee7d896d55b6131774a0a3190dd66eb7bfb", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
