Penn has since led numerous scientific sailing expeditions around the world that have conducted research on things like ocean acidification and toxics in the water. The journey will take around two years to complete.\n\nEmily Penn Instagram\n\nDon't Miss 953 SHARES 611 SHARES\n\n\u201cThe plastic pollution challenge our ocean faces is a global one and it will take an inspired army of passionate, skilled and experienced people to tackle it,\u201d says Penn to TIME.\n\nUnder her leadership, this voyage will comprise of 300 women spanning across industries and experiences, including scientists, teachers, filmmakers, product designers, photographers of different ages, skills b and cultural backgrounds. eXXpedition aims to contribute to cutting-edge scientific research and solutions based thinking.\n\nDealing with plastic has become a world-wide problem. We are consuming plastic at an alarming rate. Take a look around. Everything around you will be made of plastic. The problem has become particularly severe because plastic takes a minimum of 450 years to break down once it reaches the sea. Plastic, even if it's ground down into tiny pieces, doesn\u2019t dissolve. The oceans are slowly being choked with it: there's an estimated 8 trillion kilograms of plastic that lands up there every year.\n\nBy 2050, it's estimated that there will be more plastic in the sea than fish.\n\nWe really hope this voyage comes back with answers about what can be done to reduce plastic waste in oceans. But before that, please start with small efforts like getting rid of single use plastic and switching to bamboo products. We all need to come together to save our planet from sinking in plastic.\n\nThis plastic then makes its way to our dinner tables, and eventually ends up inside us. To put it bluntly, humans could be ingesting as much as 5 grams of plastic each week.", "description": "This voyage is also being regarded as a scientific mission, conducted by an organisation called 'eXXpedition', will cover over 38,000 nautical miles and 30 voyage legs, and will start and end in the United Kingdom.
