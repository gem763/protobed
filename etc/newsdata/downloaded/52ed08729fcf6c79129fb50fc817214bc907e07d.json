This 'honest mistake' means the Police will not be pursuing further criminal action\n\nMs Thomas said: 'It is really important that people check what they are purchasing before going ahead. This way you don't leave yourself liable to prosecution.'\n\nShe suggested people speak to their local Wildlife Crime Officer to make appropriate checks as the police can take action against illegal trade in the UK.\n\n'Seizures like this one are not only important to help stop illegal trade but are also an opportunity to educate the public about protecting endangered species.'\n\nThe Siamese crocodile population is slowly diminishing with only small numbers in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam\n\nThe Siamese Crocodile is a critically endangered Annex A species under the Control of Trade in Endangered Species (COTES) Regulations. Their population is slowly diminishing, with only small numbers in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, the total Siamese crocodile population size is around 500-1000 mature individuals.
