I have no idea, and apparently neither does he", "language": "en", "text": "It would be wrong to say that \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d was, in the end, not a historic occasion. There was plenty of history, it\u2019s just that it didn\u2019t happen in the House of Commons itself, but in a small room just outside it, where, at the end of the unhistoric historic occasion in question, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson came to answer questions from journalists about the very unhistoric history they had just witnessed.\n\nObviously, the House of Commons avoided having its big, crunch, Brexit vote for a little while longer. Instead of voting on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, it voted for a complicated amendment by the Tory backbencher, Oliver Letwin, that means MPs will now only give their formal approval to the deal after all the legislation that will be required for it has been passed, both in Westminster, and Brussels.\n\nEffectively, it was designed to stop the UK crashing out with no deal on a technicality, or by accident, or more specifically, stopping the UK doing what many people still think is the government\u2019s main strategy, which is to crash out of the EU with no deal accidentally-on-purpose.\n\nThe passing of the Letwin amendment does mean that Boris Johnson is now legally compelled to write to the EU, today, on Saturday 19 October, to ask for an extension to the Article 50 process beyond 31 October.\n\nFor several months now, the government has sustained a truly bizarre constructively ambiguous position on this, saying that \u201cit will obey the law\u201d but it won\u2019t ask for an extension. Quite how it intends to maintain both these impossible positions has been a source of considerable vexation. And the passing of the Letwin amendment should have been the moment the answer would have to come out.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t. What Johnson said was, \u201cI won\u2019t negotiate a delay with the EU\u201d. Then he sat down again.\n\nWhat does this mean? Will he be writing the letter? Won\u2019t he? This fundamental question is the one that needs to be answered, because it makes no sense. So when a hundred or so journalists gathered around the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson, to ask this very question, this was surely the point at which the ambiguity would have to end.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister has just spoken. I have nothing to add to that,\u201d came the answer, perhaps a dozen times over.\n\nWill he write the letter? Won\u2019t he write the letter? \u201cThe prime minister has just spoken. I have nothing to add to that.\u201d\n\nWhat does it mean? \u201cYou have the prime minister\u2019s words.\u201d\n\nBut what do they mean? \u201cThe prime minister has just spoken. I have nothing to add to that.\u201d\n\nSo the letter will or won\u2019t be written. The extension will or won\u2019t be requested. None of us can know.\n\nFor those interested in such parochial matters, there is much debate about whether briefings by the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson should be televised, as they are in, for example, the White House and the European Union. If the prime minister cares about such things, he can consider himself extremely lucky that there is no video footage of this occasion, which was \u2013 even in these rarefied days \u2013 among the most farcical things I have ever known.\n\nIs the prime minister going to break the law? Is he not going to break the law? \u201cYou have the prime minister\u2019s words.\u201d\n\nBut those words make no sense? \u201cThe prime minister has just spoken. I have nothing to add to that.\u201d\n\nIf he does write the letter \u2013 which he legally has to write today \u2013 will it be published later on this afternoon? \u201cYou have the prime minister\u2019s words.\u201d\n\nYou are the spokesperson. Spoke, from the ancient German, sprach, to speak, and the Greek, persona. You are the person who speaks, are you not? \u201cThe prime minister has just spoken. I have nothing to add to that.\u201d\n\nSo here we are then, on Saturday afternoon, an entirely pointless day has drawn to its pointless end. White is black. Black is white. The prime minister isn\u2019t going to break the law but isn\u2019t going to not break it.\n\nHe will write the letter but he won\u2019t write the letter. He will ask for an extension but he won\u2019t ask for an extension.\n\nYou smelt it, you dealt it. You said the rhyme, you did the crime. The one who denied it, supplied it.\n\nTwelve days till Brexit, which is either happening or not happening, depending on whether you choose to believe the people who won\u2019t tell you anything anyway.\n\nRead more\n\nBercow ready to sign extension letter to Brussels if asked\n\nVoter ID: a dangerous policy that will stifle black voices on Brexit\n\nHundreds of thousands protest at Westminster to demand Final Say vote\n\n\u2018One million\u2019 protesters demand second referendum in London\n\nVoters still don\u2019t want the hard facts on Brexit\n\nLive: PM to seek extension as Letwin amendment delays Brexit vote\n\nMPs vote to force Brexit extension beyond 31 October", "description": "It would be wrong to say that \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d was, in the end, not a historic occasion.
