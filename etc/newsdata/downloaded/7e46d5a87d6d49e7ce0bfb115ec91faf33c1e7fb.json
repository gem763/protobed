(HGTV)\n\nThe couple also claimed the renovation was riddled with defects that could lead to mould, fires, water damage and high concentrations of carbon dioxide \u2014 putting their family's health and safety at risk.\n\nNone of the couple's allegations have been proven in court.\n\nThe company, its producers and the contractor have asked for the case to be dismissed entirely.\n\nThe response to the couple's claim, filed in B.C. Supreme Court, said the renovation is up to code. It also said the contractor is not an actor and has 30 years of experience in construction.\n\nAlmeida, Waine and their four children appeared on season four of the show in 2016.\n\nDuring each episode, families have to decide whether to keep their current home. Two hosts, one real estate agent and one designer, try to sway participants to move or stay.\n\nThe real estate agent works to find a new house on the market suited to the family, while the designer renovates the participants' current home. At the end of the episode, homeowners choose to move or stay in their spruced-up old house, which is shown to them in a walk-through on camera.\n\nAlmeida and Waine claimed they paid the show's production company, Should I Stay or Should I Go West Productions, more than $175,000 for the renovation.\n\nThe kitchen, dining room, laundry room, garage and back deck were transformed. During the on-air reveal of their new house, Almeida and Waine said they loved the \"gorgeous\" final product.\n\nThey claimed issues cropped up after the show aired.\n\nIn their lawsuit, the couple said they signed a contract agreeing that work would be carried out by Kenny Gemmill, the show's resident contractor, or a \"reasonable alternative.\" Almeida and Waine claimed the show instead hired Kerry van der Griend, whom they described as an actor with \"little to no experience\" as a general contractor.\n\nThe defendants said that allegation alone is \"reckless\" and false. The court filing said the couple's allegations have harmed Van der Griend personally and professionally.\n\nAlmeida and Waine are asking for damages for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, as well as general and special damages. They did not specify how much compensation they were seeking.\n\nThe defendants denied the couple \"suffered any loss, damage or expense, as alleged or at all.\"\n\nThe Love It or List It franchise, developed by Big Coat Media in Toronto, has versions in Australia, the U.S. and several countries in Europe. Love It or List It Vancouver was the first spinoff.", "description": "Crewmembers behind the home reno show Love It Or List It Vancouver have denied all the accusations made by a dissatisfied couple who sued them\u00a0last year, saying all the renovations at the heart the lawsuit\u00a0were completed properly.", "authors": ["Rhianna Schmunk Is A Reporter For Cbc News Based In Vancouver.
