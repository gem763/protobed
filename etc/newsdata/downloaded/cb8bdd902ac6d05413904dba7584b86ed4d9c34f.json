Five years later she also became the first person to complete a \"century\" swim of over 160km in neutral water.\n\nBut four months later she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She was given the all-clear in the summer of 2018 and notched up her training again for her next challenge.\n\nJoe Washer and Elaine Kornbau Howley, who are making a crowdfunded documentary on the swimmer, released some footage of Thomas swimming the Channel.\n\nWhen she finally made it back to British shore early on Tuesday morning, Washer revealed that she celebrated with a bag of M&Ms.\n\nThe new record-holder, meanwhile, simply wrote on Facebook: \"Whoa. Ouch.\"\n\nWant more news?", "description": "Sarah Thomas, 37, set off from Dover on Sunday morning and completed the gruelling feat in 54 hours and 13 minutes, according to a swim tracker.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/16/32/74/1000x563_cmsv2_5de2823a-9db2-5d82-8c86-f8b7e45f9eef-4163274.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
