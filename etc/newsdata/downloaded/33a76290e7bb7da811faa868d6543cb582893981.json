Media reports that negotiations will come down to the wire, with the European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs the council of European leaders, saying on Wednesday afternoon: \u201cTheoretically, in seven to eight hours everything should be clear.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has told the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s powerful executive arm, he was confident an agreement could be made as early as today. Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar, one of the key players in European negotiations, also said that while he believes there is still work to do, he has faith a deal can be struck by exit day on October 31st.\n\nHowever, the DUP has said that claims the Northern Irish unionist party had agreed to the latest proposals regarding customs arrangements on the isle of Ireland were \u201cnonsense\u201d. Party leader Arlene Foster said: \u201cDiscussions continue. There needs to be a sensible deal which unionists and nationalists can support.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s team had hoped that negotiators would agree on a deal by Wednesday, before being debated and accepted by European leaders during the summit. After which, the deal would be voted on in the House of Commons. On Tuesday, Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said that he was \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d of Brexit happening on October 31st, adding: \u201cI think the votes [in the Commons] are now there for a deal.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister has also been reportedly told that even if a deal is agreed, confirming the specifics would take \u201ctwo more months\u201d, according to a German government source speaking to The Times, which pushes Brexit back to January 1st, 2020.\n\nBrexit delay until 2020? https://t.co/0qDK2772Iy \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 16, 2019\n\nThe Times reports that the EU is requiring that the UK sign up to future environmental, social, and state aid regulations as part of \u201clevel playing field\u201d provisions, as the EU is fundamentally opposed to the UK becoming an economic rival post-Brexit. On Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed concern that Brexit Britain could be a \u201cpotential competitor\u201d to the EU, along the lines of other international powerhouses China and the United States.\n\nReflecting on developments, Nigel Farage said this week promises to be \u201cone of the biggest weeks for Brexit since the referendum\u201d.\n\nThe Brexit leader does not remain optimistic that, fundamentally, a good exit treaty can be agreed, with Mr Farage saying: \u201cAt this stage, I don\u2019t think there is a cat in hell\u2019s chance of the EU agreeing this week that the UK can break completely free of single market rules or the Customs Union.\u201d\n\nHe added that the Remain-dominated Commons \u201cwill vote on another version of May\u2019s surrender treaty this weekend\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny deal that does not give us full control of our trade, borders, laws, and territorial fishing waters, it is not Brexit. And any second referendum, especially one without a Clean-Break Brexit on the ballot paper, will be a stitch-up.\n\n\u201cBoris says he wants to \u2018get Brexit done,\u2019 but committing us to another EU treaty similar to May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement will cause the UK years of wrangling and tension with Brussels, unable to focus on our bright post-Brexit future.\u201d", "description": "The Brexit Secretary has confirmed that PM Johnson will write to the EU requesting a Brexit delay if a deal is not agreed by Saturday.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Boris-Johnson-PM-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
