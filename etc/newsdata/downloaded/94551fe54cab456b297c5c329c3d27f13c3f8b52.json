The asteroid 2001 SE101 can be seen streaking in a curved line from the bottom left of the image\n\nAstronomers say they can use photographs which are interrupted by asteroids to learn more about the space rocks hurtling through them.\n\nTo this end the European Space Agency (ESA) has set up a project enlisting around 1,900 citizen volunteers to try and find asteroids in satellite images of space.\n\nThis one, in the stunning photo of the Crab Nebula, was discovered and edited by astronomy enthusiast Melina Th\u00e9venot.\n\nShe discovered the trail of an asteroid named 2001 SE101, which was first seen 18 years ago.\n\nIn the image it appears as a curved streak that crosses the image from bottom left to top right, near the nebula\u2019s centre.\n\nThe Crab Nebula is a the remnant of a supernova \u2013 the explosion of a star \u2013 in the Taurus constellation.\n\nIt got its quirky name from William Parsons, the 3rd Earl of Rosse, who looked at it through a telescope in 1840 and drew it.\n\nHis drawing came out looking something like a crab, and the name was born.\n\nThe ESA added: 'Now that volunteers have perused the platform to spot and mark asteroid trails, it is astronomers\u2019 turn to get to work.\n\n'Knowing the date and time when the Hubble images were taken, they can use the trails marked in the pictures to infer asteroids\u2019 positions and velocities.\n\n'This means they can determine the orbits and future trajectories of known and previously unknown asteroids with greater precision than before.\n\n'This knowledge is especially important for near-Earth objects: precisely determining the orbits of these asteroids can help protect our planet from possible impacts.'", "description": "The photograph was taken originally in 2005 in black and while and has now been edited by a volunteer and amateur astronomer in Germany - Melina Th\u00e9venot - who colourised it.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/17/19998670-0-image-a-19_1571673805872.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
