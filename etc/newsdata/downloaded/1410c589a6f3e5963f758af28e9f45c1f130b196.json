A ticketed passenger ran on the jet bridge, bypassing the gate agent during the boarding process of Flight 1060 from Miami to Newark, American Airlines told CBS Miami.\n\nAnother passenger who was getting ready to board took video of the man being taken into custody in the terminal after he was removed from the plane and posted it on his Twitter account.\n\n\"This guy ran on the flight and he started shouting that it was his plane and that he was from the FBI,\" Ari Teman told CBS Miami. \"And everyone started standing up to watch and they were blocking the aisle and then they called for security and he was dragged off the plane.\"\n\nVideo of police taking arrested \"decoy\" away. #aa1060.
