Instead, farmers will be rewarded for environmental work such as protecting habitats, providing flood defences and improving water quality.\n\nThere is not much point getting too excited about this specific bill because a general election is expected to be called in the coming weeks or months. However, it is a strong indication of the direction the government is heading in and many environmental organisations are cautiously optimistic.\n\nHowever, the success of the OEP will depend on whether it has as much power as the current EU system. Lots of this comes down to whether the OEP is sufficiently funded and has enough clout to hold the government to account when it\u2019s breaking its own rules (which it seems to do frequently).\n\nAlready, there are warning signs this regulatory body might not have as much muscle as its EU equivalent.\n\nOne concern is its size. Initially it will employ just 120 people \u2013 which isn\u2019t many when you consider the enormity of the task ahead.\n\nAnother warning sign is that unlike the EU, the OEP will not hand out fines. Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green Party, said it risked looking like a \u201cbogus watchdog\u201d without the power to punish the government for breaching regulations.\n\nMr Gove said we could be \u201cthe first generation to leave the environment in a better state than that in which we found it\u201d but the past few years haven\u2019t given people much hope and wildlife declines have continued unchecked.\n\nTake the cautionary tale of Natural England.\n\nThis is the government agency in charge of protecting and monitoring nature sites which has been so stripped of funding it can\u2019t do its job properly. In the past decade, the agency\u2019s budget has been cut by more than half.\n\nGeorge Monbiot commented that it was now little more than \u201ca nodding dog in the government\u2019s rear window\u201d.\n\nAs a result Natural England struggles to maintain independence from the government and if the OEP isn\u2019t taken seriously enough, it could end up in the same sorry state.\n\nIn the autumn budget, the government gave just \u00a330m to help the country meet its 2050 net zero target. This was just 0.1 per cent of what is required, according to Britain\u2019s biggest environmental groups, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth.\n\nSuch moves completely undermine the government\u2019s legal commitment to cut greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050.\n\nComments about pursuing the \u201csustainable growth\u201d of the aviation sector are another indication that it\u2019s not that serious about meeting net zero. How will we know if it is serious about meeting other environment pledges?\n\nWhen (if?) Brexit happens there will be many new forces to contend with. We will be under extreme pressure to agree new trade deals with countries with dodgy records when it comes to animal welfare. Pressure to get trade deals set up could mean these values are watered down.\n\nEnvironmental issues are seen as more important than ever \u2013 the public wants the government to take the protection of the natural world seriously. This new regulatory body must reverse shocking declines in UK wildlife and protect our natural spaces and ensure we meet carbon pledges.\n\nAs Professor Lord John Krebs from the University of Oxford says: \u201cA toothless watchdog will not be enough.\u201d", "description": "There has been much talk about a green Brexit.\u00a0As environment secretary\u00a0Michael Gove\u00a0said, leaving the EU meant not only would the UK\u00a0match EU green policies,\u00a0it\u00a0would outclass them.\u00a0 The government has now released a massive \u2013 and much anticipated \u2013 Environment Bill that will take over from EU law after Brexit.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/17/istock-1171739176.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
