Multiple launch rocket systems were stationed at Suruc, some 60 km (40 miles) to the west, opposite the Syrian border town of Kobani, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nERDOGAN VISIT\n\nThe prospect of a military offensive has unsettled Turkish financial markets, with the lira this week hitting its weakest level since late August. The currency firmed slightly to 5.8220 against the dollar on Wednesday morning.\n\nErdogan will visit the United States on Nov. 13 at Trump's invitation, a White House spokesman said. On Monday, Erdogan said U.S. troops had started to withdraw after a phone call he had with Trump, adding that talks between Turkish and U.S. officials on the matter would continue.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Turkey has chosen to act unilaterally. As a result we have moved the U.S. forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety,\" U.S. Defense Department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.\n\nTrump's decision to withdraw troops from northeast Syria has rattled allies, including France, one of Washington's main partners in the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.\n\nRussia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's strongest foreign ally, said it was not told in advance by Washington or Turkey about any agreements to pull U.S. troops. Amid deepening humanitarian concerns, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties in northeast Syria to exercise maximum restraint and protect civilians.", "description": "Turkish forces and Syrian rebel allies will cross the Syrian border \"shortly\", a Turkish official said early on Wednesday, as a surprise withdrawal of U.S. troops made way for the Turkish incursion.
