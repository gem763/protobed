Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., brushed off the possibility that he and Sen. Elizabeth Warren could split the progressive vote, creating an easy path for former Vice President Joe Biden to win the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nAs it stands now, polls show Sanders and Warren vying for second place behind Biden even though the combined bloc supporting the two progressives is larger than that of the ex-vice president.\n\nSanders and Warren have broadly similar platforms. While there are some differences between their approaches, they both support Sanders\u2019s signature Medicare for All public health care plan, large increases in spending to fight climate change, and programs to cut student debt and expand affordable housing.\n\nBiden has far more moderate positions, including a health care plan that would preserve private insurance and more modest spending to address climate change. And while Biden has called for increased education spending, unlike Warren and Sanders he hasn\u2019t backed plans to make public colleges fully tuition-free and to eliminate large amounts of student debt. Sanders has said Biden doesn\u2019t share his \u201cvision\u201d for the country.\n\nStill, when asked about the possibility that having two progressive candidates will end up dooming them both, Sanders offered a one-word response.\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think there is a political process, and people will make their own choices,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling pretty good about the future.\u201d\n\nThe Vermont senator stressed that he is \u201cconfident\u201d about his organization in key early states.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a long way away from Election Day in Iowa. I think it\u2019s about five months, and a lot can change. All I can say is that given the grassroots movement that we have in Iowa, in New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, California, I\u2019m feeling pretty good that we\u2019re going to win those states,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Sanders and Warren share similar policy goals, there are some indications their bases of support are quite different, and if one dropped out, the supporters wouldn\u2019t necessarily migrate to the remaining candidate. But Sanders offered a message to any progressives who might be choosing between him and Warren.\n\nWhen asked about the distinctions between the two, Sanders emphasized his record and role in pushing the Democratic Party to the left since his last run for president in 2016.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (Screenshot: Yahoo News) More\n\n\u201cWhat I would say is, if you look at the issues that folks are talking about today \u2014 not only candidates but people all over this country \u2014 that has a lot to do with my willingness four years ago to stand up to the political establishment, the economic establishment, the media establishment, and say, \u2018You know what? Maybe we need policies and a government that represents all of us and not just wealthy campaign contributors,\u2019\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhile Warren is mounting her first presidential campaign and doesn\u2019t have as long a political career as Sanders, she was a prominent advocate for reducing income inequality during her prior academic career. Since she was elected to the Senate in 2012, Warren has, like Sanders, pushed for dramatic expansions to public education and health care programs.\n\nSanders said he\u2019s pleased other candidates are supporting aspects of his agenda, including universal health care, free public education and aggressive steps to fight climate change.\n\n\u201cThese are issues that I talked about in a very aggressive way. I am proud that other candidates are coming onboard,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut I think that if you check my record, I have a life of standing up to the very powerful special interests and fighting for working people.\u201d\n\nYahoo News pressed Sanders on whether he was implying that he \u201cpaved the way\u201d for Warren\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to talk about Elizabeth Warren or anybody else; [it\u2019s] not a question of paving the way. Everybody comes to their own views,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAll I can say is that for the last many decades, going back to when I was elected mayor of Burlington, my record has been standing up for working families, taking on powerful special interests and, in fact, achieving some real results.\u201d", "description": "Bernie Sanders brushed off the possibility that he and Sen.
