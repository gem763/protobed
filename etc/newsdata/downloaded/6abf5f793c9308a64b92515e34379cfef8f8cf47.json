(GTBP) (GTBP.PA) an immuno-oncology company focused on innovative treatments based on the Company's proprietary NK cell engager (TriKE\u2122) platform, announced today that Drs. Jeffrey Miller, Martin Felices and Pippa Kennedy from the University of Minnesota presented research results at the recently concluded 18th meeting of the Society for Natural Immunity concerning a solid tumor targeting TriKE\u2122 which demonstrates killing of non-small cell lung cancer tumor cells.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 84% of all lung cancer diagnoses. In 2019, it is estimated there will be 228,150 cases of newly diagnosed lung cancer. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer, and this year it is estimated that 142,670 people will die from lung cancer. The 5-year survival rate for all people with all types of lung cancer is 19%.\n\nMr. Anthony Cataldo, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GT Biopharma commented \"we are excited about the progress Dr. Miller and his colleagues are making developing a TriKE\u2122 which targets solid tumors.\" Mr. Cataldo further stated \"we believe the NSCLC TriKE\u2122 has the potential to offer lung cancer patients with a treatment option that achieves targeted killing of metastatic lung cancer cells in all locations within the body, and hopefully will become part of a scalable and curative therapeutic strategy for lung cancer patients.\"\n\nAbout GTB-3550 TriKE\u2122 and GTB-3550 TriKE\u2122 Phase I/II Clinical Trial\n\nGTB-3550 is the Company's first TriKE\u2122 product candidate which is a single-chain, tri-specific recombinant fusion protein construct composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD16 and anti-CD33 antibodies and a modified form of IL-15. The GTB-3550 Phase I/II clinical trial for treatment of patients with CD33-expressing, high risk myelodysplastic syndromes, refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia or advanced systemic mastocytosis opened for patient enrollment September 2019. The clinical trial is being conducted at the University of Minnesota's Masonic Cancer Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota under the direction of Dr. Erica Warlick.\n\nAbout GT Biopharma, Inc.\n\nGT Biopharma, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of immuno-oncology products based off our proprietary Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE\u2122) and Multi-Target Directed Bispecific Drug Conjugate technology platforms. Our TriKE platform is designed to harness and enhance the cancer killing abilities of a patient's immune system natural killer cells (NK cells). GT Biopharma has an exclusive worldwide license agreement with the University of Minnesota to further develop and commercialize cancer therapies using proprietary TriKE technology developed by researchers at the university to target NK cells to cancer. Our Multi-Target Directed Bispecific Drug Conjugate platform can generate product candidates that are bi-specific, ligand-directed single-chain fusion proteins that, we believe, represent the next generation of targeted therapy.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including statements regarding the potential acquisition, the likelihood of closing the potential transaction, our clinical focus, and our current and proposed trials.
