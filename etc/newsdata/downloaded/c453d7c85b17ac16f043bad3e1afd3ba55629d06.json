However, he might not get to add to his 24 test caps just yet.\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland replied \u201cpossibly\u201d when asked if Hill is going to be ruled out of the tournament.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t return to fitness he\u2019ll go back to the U.K.,\u201d Gatland added. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to assess him tomorrow and just see how much progress he\u2019s made.\u201d\n\nWales beat Georgia 43-14 on Monday and has matches in Pool D against Australia on Sunday, then Fiji and Uruguay.\n\nGatland\u2019s side scored six tries against Georgia without adding to its injury list, even though flyhalf Dan Biggar picked up a minor cut to his chin from a teammate\u2019s head during the pre-match warmup.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been through it with the physio now. We\u2019ve got a few guys sore and battered, as you\u2019d expect after an international test match. But nothing of major concern.\u201d\n\nWales led 29-0 at halftime, and then faded after the break.\n\nTwo-time champion Australia followed the opposite pattern in beating Fiji 39-21 in its opening game.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a tough side. Australia played exceptionally well against the All Blacks in Perth,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cAs a team we tend to get stronger the longer we go on in tournaments. But there\u2019s a lot of room for us to improve.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Wales will give a fitness test to injured lock Cory Hill on Tuesday, which may decide whether he stays at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
