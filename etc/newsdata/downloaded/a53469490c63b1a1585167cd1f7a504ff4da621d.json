In this series, the team at VICE's Astro Guide explain each planet, and how it correlates to your natal chart.\n\nMars is the planet of passion, anger, war, assertion, and separation, and its placement in your birth chart indicates how you pursue your goals, assert yourself, attack and defend, and cut people or circumstances off (think breakups). It also points to the way you weaponize your skills for protection and competition. Knowing someone\u2019s Mars sign can tell you how they fight and what they fight for.\n\nBut Mars isn\u2019t all about the battle. It\u2019s also the planet that symbolizes your sex life! In a natal chart, Mars symbolizes the way you tap into raw, primal instincts, including the way you disseminate creative and sexual energy. It\u2019s true that Venus plays a major role in creativity, but Mars offers the fiery energy that disperses that creativity. Venus is the yin to Mars\u2019s yang, meaning Venus is the more receptive energy while Mars is more concerned with projecting outwards. Both have their place in the bedroom.\n\nWhile Venus symbolizes your experience of harmony and receiving, Mars shows stamina and how you express your libido. Venus is the embrace, and Mars is the thrust! And although Venus demonstrates social and romantic compatibility, your Mars\u2019s placement in your natal chart will clue you in on inexplicable chemistry\u2014the type of attraction that feels powerful, animalistic, and driven by passion. Regardless of sex or gender identity, Mars essentially symbolizes peacocking behavior to potential mates.\n\nMars can travel far from the sun, so it\u2019s not easy to guess simply based on someone\u2019s birthday! To find your Mars sign, plug in your birth date, time, and location to your preferred birth chart generator and find the symbol that looks like a circle with an arrow pointing up, illustrative of a penetrative force. Once you\u2019ve figured it out, read what our team of astrologers at Astro Guide have to say about your Mars sign!\n\nAries Mars\n\nWeapon: Ram\u2019s horns, head-butting\n\nMars is at home in the sign of Aries, meaning it can do what it does best: act! Act first, then figure out the rest later. Aries is the first of the fire signs and having Mars here points to spot-on intuition that leads to immediate\u2014and often impulsive\u2014action. People with Mars in Aries are great at thinking on their toes and have a knack for working in high-paced environments, so your habit of taking the initiative usually works out. When it comes to fighting and fucking, you like to approach people head-on. You\u2019re very direct, telling it like it is, so people know where they stand with you. Of course, you\u2019re also a bit of a show-off, so it\u2019s not hard to tell when you\u2019re sexually attracted to someone. Whether you play daredevil in front of your love interest or tease and taunt them, you make sure that people know you\u2019re there.\n\nDespite Aries getting much of its reputation for feistiness from the god of war, Ares, your Mars sign is actually named after the ram in the Golden fleece mythology. Nonetheless, Mars is still Aries\u2019s planetary ruler, and is super powerful in this sign! Of course, you\u2019re still a bit of a hot-head, so it\u2019s important that you learn to practice more patience. Considering your drive to always be on top, you also want to be mindful about playing the role of the bully.\n\nAll aside, you\u2019re gifted with a fearless and courageous temperament, both of which are a fantastic vehicle for taking action! At your best, you wage a fight for the underdog\u2014believing in their strength (while knowing your own)\u2014and possess incredible willpower.\n\nTaurus Mars\n\nWeapon: Bull\u2019s horns, bullheadedness, and brute strength\n\nTaurus is a sign known for taking its time with the things it has to do. So Mars\u2014the initiative-taking planet\u2014doesn\u2019t express itself the way it normally would here, making it a unique and special placement. As a fixed earth sign, Taurus is also known for being stubborn while Mars is all about expressing your will, which means people probably have a hard time getting you to do anything you don\u2019t want to do! Laziness can sometimes lead to your downfall, but you\u2019re also more intentional about how you invest your energy, especially when it comes to who you\u2019ll bone and which battles to fight.\n\nYou also prefer to take your time instead of rushing to your end goal, but what you lack in speed you make up for with deliberation! You\u2019re not the type to act impulsively because you\u2019re more focused on spending the least amount of energy while still getting the results you want. In the natal chart, Mars in Taurus is motivated by comfort, but desire itself can often lead you to stray from effort. That said, it\u2019s important that you\u2019re mindful not to ditch endeavors that call for your blood, sweat, and tears for the path of least resistance. Endurance to power through your goals is one of your strengths, but pacing yourself and admitting the value of persistence and consistency is something you\u2019re learning with this Mars placement. When you stick to your pursuits, your talent for efficiency shines through. While Mars is the planet of passion, sex, and anger, your libido and temper tend be slow to arouse, but you don\u2019t lack in stamina and force once you get going!\n\nGemini Mars\n\nWeapon: Words, hands, and the mind\n\nMars in Gemini is often known for playing the role of devil\u2019s advocate. It\u2019s also a sign of great debating skills with a talent for arguing about a broad variety of topics, even if you only have a superficial understanding of them. Your secret weapon? Agility with words! Mars is the planet of strategy and severance, while Gemini is the sign that symbolizes the mind and communication. Mercury-ruled Gemini is often known as the silver-tongued trickster, but Mars in Gemini points to a sharp tongue! You love to learn about everything under the sun, and you\u2019ll even go as far as provoking people just to see what their reaction is and what you can learn from it. Outwitting your competition tends to be your goal, but when you\u2019re the one who is out-smarted, you\u2019re turned on and/or willing to concede with respect for your opponent.\n\nYou\u2019re quick on your feet, but your mouth moves even faster. If you don\u2019t slow down every now and then, you\u2019re also prone to cutting people with your words. Just because you can say it, doesn\u2019t mean you should. Speaking carefully is important if you don\u2019t want to hurt others unintentionally or have your own words used against you. When it comes to sex, you\u2019re curious enough to experiment and try out all kinds of things, at least once. New sexual experiences are a big motivator for you, but a healthy dose of dirty talk and new positions can do the trick if you\u2019re in a monogamous relationship.\n\nCancer Mars\n\nWeapon: Small but sharp crab pincers, protective shell\n\nHaving natal Mars in Cancer is a sign that you\u2019re not a fan of confrontation. Like the side-walking crab, you\u2019re known for playing defense in a less direct manner. Like Mars in Taurus, Mars in Cancer expresses itself in a unique way, contrary to its planetary nature. When you respond to an argument or an invitation to bone, you come prepared, but it also hints that you may have a tendency to overthink things. Your driving force is your eagerness to build a safe and happy home life, making you quite industrious. When it comes to flirting, you enjoy the chase, but again, tend not to make direct moves\u2014you like to take your time, slowly seducing someone with your tender, emotionally in-tune, sensual ways!\n\nAlthough your intuition tends to be on point, your method of engaging others requires very thoughtful and strategic messaging. Targeting the hearts of lovers and foes is a strength to embrace, but if you let your emotional reflexes get the best of you (which you often do), you can struggle to appeal to other people\u2019s emotional sides in the way you were aiming for. Team building is actually an innate gift that you can lean into when you need support to reach certain goals. Cancer is a sign that needs to belong, so convincing others that they want to join you, instead of oppose you, is your ticket to \u201cwinning.\u201d The tricky part is that when you get upset, your reaction is often to become overwhelmed with your emotions and freeze, meltdown, or hide in your cave (you\u2019re not afraid to ghost someone when they upset you). Getting people to side with you is a skill, but it takes time, so you have to learn to demonstrate patience and confidence while you wait for your magic to work. Having Mars in Cancer doesn\u2019t make you helpless, but it does mean you feel extra vulnerable. Unlike Mars in fire signs, your watery Mars placement suggests you need time to take information in and digest it before acting. Having space to figure out what you what to do and when you want to strike is important. Once you do win people over, though, you\u2019re boosted with energy to fight for those you care about\u2014and you\u2019ll do whatever it takes to protect them.\n\nLeo Mars\n\nWeapon: Teeth\n\nNo one wants to mess with a lion, so you\u2019re quite proud to have Mars in this sign! Your roar is loud\u2014and your bite is hard, too. You command respect and have a regal air about you. You almost have to laugh when someone picks a fight with you because it\u2019s unbelievable that someone would imagine confronting you! In the wild, lions commonly strangulate prey by crushing their airways with their teeth/jaw force\u2026you do this by stealing the spotlight from your nemeses. Just like lions that hunt in prides, you possess social influence and know how to sway people in the direction you want, particularly to turn on those who have wronged you and others. Humiliating others or singling them out is an effective way to get people off your back, but you also need to watch your catiness. If you\u2019re not conscientious about it, you can become the bully that burns people.\n\nMetaphorically, you know how to snuff out a person\u2019s fire, but you also know how to lift people up, and when you\u2019re flirting, you love to give compliments and see the joy other people feel when they get attention. Generally, though, you prefer the spotlight to be on you, and you aren\u2019t averse to hooking up in public or in front of a mirror! Sometimes you\u2019ll pick a fight for fun, just because you love drama. You love a game of cat and mouse with a fair amount of chase, but you\u2019re repelled by show-offs. You\u2019re also very loyal to those you love, and show up to fight for them without hesitation.\n\nVirgo Mars\n\nWeapon: Holier than thou, will condemn you\n\nMars in analytical Virgo strategizes and approaches problems with surgical precision. You love helping people and you\u2019re motivated by being of service to others. With an eye for detail, you\u2019re also talented at finding weak spots, flaws, and holes in arguments\u2014and asking considerate questions is one of the ways you catch your opponents off guard and break through their defense. You work best when you have a to-do list, and lists and spreadsheets might be your secret weapon. You\u2019re either very organized or your place is a total mess because you\u2019re juggling so many projects. Luckily, you always know where everything is!\n\nYou prefer to get things done through proper channels, always ready with your paperwork in order. You don\u2019t cut corners and you make sure people know you\u2019ll do things \u201cthe right way,\u201d but you\u2019re also very clever\u2014able to find a loophole just about anywhere\u2014using your wits to talk your way into good graces if that\u2019s the only option. Mars in Virgo strives for perfection, and you\u2019re not afraid to point out where others fall short. In fact, it\u2019s one of your most disarming weapons\u2014you can read anyone to filth! Just be mindful about turning your weapon on yourself; self-deprecation is dangerous in front of the wrong company. While you can be quite critical and know what to say to hurt someone\u2019s feelings, you also know exactly what to say to get someone to be interested in you. You\u2019re patient and will always make the effort to find your partner\u2019s sweet spot. Lucky them! Anyone fortunate enough to be your lover knows you\u2019re not stingy in the bedroom. Yours is a Mars sign that aims to please.\n\nLibra Mars\n\nWeapon: Kills you with kindness, the pen, and contracts\n\nWarrior Mars usually doesn\u2019t care about getting covered with mud during a battle, but dainty Libra would rather not get their new clothes stained. Like Mars in Gemini, Mars in Libra fights with words. Having Mars in Venus-ruled Libra makes you highly aware of how others perceive you\u2014and very good at using it to your advantage! Mars in Libra is about optics, but it\u2019s also about fairness, making it vital that you have wordsmiths on your side (like lawyers, writers, and politicians) if you\u2019re not already crafty with words to defend and drive home your points. But the chances are that you\u2019re actually very articulate. Appearances are important to your Mars sign, which can lead you to be passive aggressive, leading people to conclusions in round-about ways instead of getting to the point. When charm and manners don\u2019t work, however, you\u2019re not afraid to pour your anger and passion into an articulate letter or speech. You like to keep things civil, so your martial talents tend toward diplomacy, compromise, and the art of persuasion. You have an aversion to confrontation, so you usually find the most palatable way to present an argument or disagreement before approaching others. Your ability to see both sides of a situation might be your greatest strength when it comes to anticipating and countering arguments.\n\nYou\u2019re highly motivated to win the trust of others, and humility is one of your greatest qualities that helps you achieve this goal. The passive type, you\u2019re more likely to wait for others to make the first move in the bedroom and on the debate floor. As an airy cerebral Mars placement, you\u2019re good at mirroring partners and opponents, intuiting their train of thought and movement. But rather than risking rejection or failure, you prefer to wait and see how you can reach your goal without spending time in the trial-and-error process, which makes the pen (and written word) a more powerful tool to you. You can erase, scribble out, and carefully edit a written message, but actions speak louder than words, and the thought of that being used against you makes you reluctant to say or do anything that can give others ammunition. Committing to a decision can feel intimidating to you because you\u2019re well aware that there are always consequences to actions, and the thought of not being able to undo something often makes you hesitant. But more often than not, that can lead you to gain an unfavorable reputation, so it\u2019s important that you make an effort to earn and maintain people\u2019s trust by following through.\n\nScorpio Mars\n\nWeapon: Stinger, poison, secrecy\n\nWith Mars in Scorpio, you like to play offense\u2014you\u2019re very calculating and often eight steps ahead of everyone else, making sure that all bases are covered before others have the chance to make a move! Intuition and focus grant you talent in uncovering and addressing every weak spot your opponent possesses, so you\u2019re keen on taking your time to make the right move. Psychological warfare is your game, and no one plays it better than you. As someone who is highly empathetic, you know how to get under someone\u2019s skin, but you also know what to do to make someone desire you. Instead of taking information at face value, you rely on sharp psychic senses to suss out insecurities, weak spots, and hidden desires, and then weaponize them or use them to seduce others. That said, your tendency to fixate on goals and objects of desire can be a double-edged sword, making it important that you embrace detachment and the law of impermanence. Losing and making mistakes are important experiences to acquire if you ever want to win.\n\nA natural sleuth, you often use anonymity or camouflage to protect yourself until you\u2019ve assessed that it\u2019s safe to let your guard down. When threatened, you don\u2019t hesitate to use whatever secrets or insecurities you\u2019ve dug up to sting others\u2014and your targets often won\u2019t know what hit them until it\u2019s too late. People tend to be afraid of the dark because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s around them, but you\u2019re comfortable lingering in the shadows, and you\u2019re fond of luring both mates and opponents there to have your way with them.\n\nSagittarius Mars\n\nWeapon: Bow and arrow\n\nAs a Mars in Sagittarius native, your fiery temperament makes you both a passionate lover and fighter. If there were one word to describe your Mars sign, it would be \u201cloud.\u201d There\u2019s usually an air of drama about you when you get upset and you\u2019re not one to hold back. It\u2019s not enough for people to know when you\u2019re mad\u2014you also want them to know why! While you often use humor to make your points, you take your beliefs seriously. You\u2019re known for playing the role of both preacher and politician to disarm and attack, giving you the reputation of being self-righteous and philosophical. People will know you\u2019re on the war-path against them not only because you have a big mouth, but because you\u2019re expert at crusading against people. Keep in mind that you need to be careful about getting lost in or swallowed up by your own anger.\n\nPeople need to be long-winded to keep up with you, especially in a fight\u2014when you show up for a battle, you\u2019re usually found stepping on your soap box. But Mars in the sign of the centaur also points to your love of partying. Despite your moral interests, indulging in a little debauchery can actually be a turn-on and the party scene is where you\u2019ll let loose. If you\u2019re not thoughtful, people can call you out for being hypocritical and try to throw you off your high horse. That said, justice is incredibly important to you and your carrot stick tends to be \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d While your bottom half is all animal (a sign of great instincts), your top half has a brain\u2014one filled with cultured insights from your travels. Whether you\u2019re flirting or fighting, you\u2019re always ready to flex some knowledge.\n\nCapricorn Mars\n\nWeapon: Will end your career\n\nMars has access to its greatest power in the sign of the sea-goat, which means you\u2019re the boss in any situation, Capricorn Mars. You make the rules...and you enforce them! Saturn-ruled Capricorn is famous for industriousness and with natal Mars in this formidable earth sign, you possess incredible staying power. A force to be reckoned with, you have the ability to out-climb opponents and strategically make it to the top, the same way mountain goats nimbly leap their way up the steepest cliffs and mountains. Willing to take risks, you don\u2019t let the fear of falling from great heights stop you from pursuing your goals. Even if you fall, you\u2019re resilient enough to take failures in stride.\n\nPatience is part of your strategy and you have the capacity to play the long game, knowing when and where to strike. Yours is a Mars sign filled with wisdom and grit. Everything you do is for a reason, and you have the fortitude to wait out the hardest situations until opportunity arrives. You\u2019re no stranger to pushing yourself to aspirational heights, even when there\u2019s no end or finish line in sight. In fact, there often isn\u2019t a limit for you because you\u2019re always setting the bar higher. Your headstrong demeanor usually leaves a trail of followers and hopeful competitors in your path, inspired to accomplish the greatness that you pursue without fear.\n\nWhen it comes to sex, you have plenty of stamina\u2014you\u2019re one lusty goat! Playful taunting and teasing, as well as flaunting power in the bedroom are fun ways you enjoy expressing your sexuality. As an earthy Mars, your lovers would also say you\u2019re highly sensual.\n\nAlthough Capricorn is famous for its business-oriented reputation, you definitely party as hard as you work...that passionate energy has to go somewhere once you leave the office! While you\u2019re not one to take revenge, you\u2019ll end someone\u2019s career if they deserve it.\n\nAquarius Mars\n\nWeapon: Isolation\n\nAquarius never cares about fitting in, yet this sign is always in the cool kids club. With Mars in the sign of Aquarius, you may exclude people when you go on attack\u2014you know that rejection stings! Aquarius is a rebellious sign, so having natal Mars here also means you don\u2019t care to follow the rules. You\u2019re motivated by causes that make people\u2019s lives better, so you\u2019ll resist the urge to break the rules if that means violating someone\u2019s personal boundaries. Nonetheless, you will try to reason your way out having to abide by them. Despite its misleading name, Aquarius is a rationally-oriented air sign (not a water sign) so having Mars here is an indication that you\u2019re driven to assert your ideas, however wild they might seem. Whether they\u2019re lying in bed with you or going up against you in a fight, people often can\u2019t read you. Keeping the competition on their toes is advantageous, but communication is vital in the bedroom.\n\nBattling with you can be intimidating to people because your judgement doesn\u2019t tend to get clouded by overwhelming emotions. You\u2019re not a robot, but your ability to remain objective during an argument can frustrate others and translate into a lack of passion. But you\u2019re not dispassionate; you\u2019re passionately independent, challenging others to think for themselves. The secret is that you might also act detached because you know it presses people\u2019s buttons, giving you an upper hand in certain situations. This makes it important that you\u2019re mindful not to gaslight your opponents. You love being a rebel, surprising people, and doing things your own way. If you were stranded and needed rescuing, you would probably know how to build a flashlight out of a potato\u2014you\u2019re resourceful and inventive. Why are you stranded in the middle of nowhere with a potato? Who knows! That\u2019s Mars in Aquarius\u2014you\u2019re always up to something unexpected.\n\nPisces Mars\n\nWeapon: Love\n\nMars is complicated in Pisces: As a Jupiter-ruled water sign, Pisces is all about bringing things together while Mars seeks to seperate. The result often leaves you acting a bit flakey. Your strength is less about divisiveness and more about flexibility and raw emotional power. Water is reflective, and having Mars in this sign makes you empathetic and compassionate. You intuit what competitors and opponents are feeling, but you don\u2019t necessarily weaponize that information. Emotion and sensitivity aren\u2019t a weakness, especially when you have Mars in Pisces. Similar to the other watery Mars signs, you\u2019re driven to fight for who and what you care about, but you need to be mindful about when you play the role of the martyr. The more you believe in something, the stronger your drive. You\u2019re motivated by unity, so you\u2019ll often try to convey your empathy, mirroring what people believe. Like Mars in Sagittarius, you appeal to faith, but water signs have more subtle ways of playing offense and defense. Although Mars is a planet that prefers direct attacks that involve fire or blades, water has its own way of making people surrender. Water can be soft, but it can also crash, knocking down opponents with force. Your ability to tap into and speak to people\u2019s emotions can feel like an overwhelming wave of truth they didn\u2019t see until they were hit with it.\n\nWhen it comes to sex and romance, you aim to whisk your lovers away with eroticism and fantasy. Pisces is infatuated with the love story of a victim, so you might also enjoy playing out these kinds of scenarios in the bedroom with ties or elaborate role play. Of course, if you want to skip all the pretending, you might simply hop in the shower or a body of water and let the rhythm of the waves do their work.\n\nWhat's in the stars for you in October?
