The drop came after the courier delivery service giant\u2019s first-quarter results, with adjusted earnings that came in at $3.05 per share \u2014 an 11.8% decline from the previous year period and well below consensus bets of $3.57 a share. Sales remained mostly flat at $17.05 billion, but Wall Street\u2019s average estimate was $18.04 billion.\n\nMore from Footwear News\n\nFor the full fiscal year, FedEx predicts adjusted earnings per share in the range of $11 to $13 \u2014 a downward adjustment from its previous forecasts. It also announced expectations of slowing international trade volumes \u2014 which will contract this year for the first time since 2009 \u2014 as the trade dispute between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping continues to adversely affect manufacturing in Europe and Asia as well as stifle global shipping demand. (According to the Memphis, Tenn.-based firm, international sources account for a third of its annual revenue.)\n\n\u201cThe new forecast reflects our lower revenue outlook driven by increasing trade tensions and the corresponding weakening in global economic conditions,\u201d EVP and CFO Alan Graf said in a conference call with investors. \u201cWith the increasing uncertainty of trade negotiations and government policies, forecasting customer demand and our corresponding earnings is exceedingly difficult. \u2026 A further ramping in any trade measures and/or adverse changes in international trade policies and relations would likely drive additional weakness in our business.\u201d\n\nOver the past year and a half, the Trump administration has initiated four tranches of tariffs on Chinese imports. The U.S. leader recently postponed levies on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods \u2014 representing the combined first three tranches \u2014 as a \u201cmeasure of goodwill\u201d during the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The 5% duty increase, originally scheduled to take effect on Oct. 1, will now be imposed on Oct. 15.\n\nHowever, the fourth group of duties, which would impact $300 billion in Chinese imports \u2014 including footwear, apparel and other accessories \u2014 has been spread across two dates. On Sept. 1, Washington hit Beijing with a 15% levy on $112 billion worth of those goods. China retaliated by slapping American products with new duties that range from 5% to 10%. Tariffs on the remaining $188 billion will be implemented on Dec. 15.\n\nWant more?\n\nColumbia, VF Corp. and Others in the Outdoor Industry Warn Congress of Tariffs\u2019 Impact\n\nRun the Numbers: As Tariffs Loom, Consumers Might Be Deterred From Buying Big\n\nSign up for FN's Newsletter.
