That is all I could think about when Gina was in the kitchen at Emily\u2019s daughter Annabelle\u2019s birthday party with a full tiger painted on her face and talking about her DUI hearing.\n\nThat is some serious cognitive dissonance right there. Sure, Gina can\u2019t see it, but can\u2019t she just feel that face paint burning into her skin while she\u2019s trying to talk to her friend about very grown-up matters? Then she almost gets into a fight with Emily about how she\u2019s getting closer to Shannon, and the only thing worse than being dressed like an \u201980s mall rat with crimped hair while screaming in someone\u2019s face is getting in a fight with a bad Daniel Tiger drawing on your mug.\n\nThe two of them are talking about the \u201cwellness retreat\u201d in Arizona that Shannon is taking everyone to. Shannon says it\u2019s a place where they\u2019ll work out and meditate but also do fun things like have a honey tasting inside a giant beehive. I don\u2019t know. I know what honey tastes like. Do I really want to do it somewhere that I could be stung by hundreds of bees at any moment?\n\nThe big argument here is not about whether they\u2019re going to go but whether Victoria Denise Gunvalson Jr. is going to be invited. Shannon wants her there because she thinks that Vicki and Kelly need to heal their relationship. The producers also want her there because without Vicki talking about Kelly\u2019s train, the only thing that would be happening this season is us staring at Dr. Deb\u2019s evolving collection of non\u2013Countess Crackerjack\u2013brand statement necklaces.\n\nKelly doesn\u2019t want to see Vicki ever again, so she says she won\u2019t go on the trip if Vicki\u2019s there. Shannon thinks they need to be together to heal, but let me tell you something, there is going to be no healing going on between these two. Tamra \u2014 who, smartly, is on Kelly\u2019s side \u2014 points out that Vicki has been spreading rumors about people and saying \u201cThat\u2019s just what I heard\u201d for the better part of a decade. She does it when Tamra and Shannon stop by her house and she says, \u201cI heard they call Braunwyn \u2018Boring Wyn,\u2019\u201d which is the dumbest putdown I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nVicki tells Tamra and Shannon that she wants peace with Kelly, but she\u2019s going to stand up for herself. The problem is that to achieve the peace that Shannon wants, one of these two women is going to have to back down. This really falls at Vicki\u2019s feet. I don\u2019t blame Kelly for being upset that Vicki spread a rumor that she had a train pulled on her by eight guys. But we all know that when Kelly gets mad, she doesn\u2019t just throw bombs \u2014 she does an incantation to bring about an asteroid like the one that killed all the dinosaurs to assail the Earth. That leaves Vicki to be the bigger person, but if history has taught us anything, it\u2019s that Vicki would fit right in during the scene when Dorothy first finds the Yellow Brick Road. That is to say, this fight will continue on forever and anyone wishing otherwise is a fool.\n\nThis episode is just littered with family fights that will never end. Kelly is also in a conflict with her mother and younger brother Eric, who moved back to Arizona after living with Kelly for a year and a half. Kelly felt they were taking advantage of her, and now she hasn\u2019t talked to that branch of her family in almost two years. Yikes! The only good part of this is that we learned that Jolie has her mom saved in her phone as \u201cMommie Dearest.\u201d I am so heartened that a 12-year-old girl from Orange County knows enough about the oeuvres of both Faye Dunaway and Joan Crawford that she would even make that joke.\n\nOver in Tamra\u2019s gated community, she\u2019s asking if her liberal son, Spencer, will get along with his half-brother, Ryan, a gun-toting, MAGA-hat-wearing, gay-wedding-cake-hating Trump supporter. They are in the exact same place as Vicki and Kelly. Ryan is mad at Spencer for calling him a racist (or a Nazi, in Spencer\u2019s telling), and he is waiting for an apology. Spencer says that he\u2019s waiting for Ryan to do something, because he\u2019s not being open-minded. All I know is that whenever politics rears its ugly head on the Housewives, I want to retreat back into my body like a circumcised penis after a Polar Bear Plunge. This is our escape! Stop fouling it up with your very real and legitimate and timely family issues.\n\nThings between Braunwyn and Dr. Deb are a little bit deeper and chillier. They go on a hike, and Dr. Deb is wearing a gold necklace so large even Biggie Smalls would think it was garish and that appropriately says \u201cEGO.\u201d Braunwyn asks her mother about a recent incident involving her aunt, Dr. Deb\u2019s sister. Apparently Braunwyn doesn\u2019t want her children around this aunt, and Dr. Deb didn\u2019t respect her wishes. When Braunwyn confronts her mom about this, Dr. Deb just says, \u201cOh, look! A bee.\u201d Braunwyn has to make a concerted effort to let her mother know how she feels and let her know that her boundaries are crossed.\n\nHer mother eventually gets it, and the two stand about a meter apart, both staring off at nothing in particular, seething that this very familiar script has played out once again. The bees keep buzzing, the flowers keep swaying, and the two of them, lodged in their fragile interiority, just imagine a world where the other was not as they are. They imagine a beautiful place where everything was fixed and everyone behaved just as they did, and then that feeble fantasy is destroyed by a man in a red tech fleece vest with his face blurred out speeding by because his Apple Watch has told him he needs 4,000 more steps to complete one of his fitness circles.\n\nOnce again, we have to end with the cold war between Emily and her husband, Shane, a malignant golem made of lint. I have said before and I will say again that I think the problems in Emily and Shane\u2019s marriage are brought about by both of them. Like when Emily, who is headed to Vegas, says, \u201cSo you\u2019re going to take care of the kids?\u201d I can see how that is annoying. Of course Shane is going to take care of the kids. Emily is not looking for an answer but rather a way to connect with Shane about the kids and the shared joy they both take in them.\n\nHowever, Shane does himself no favors. When she asks that question, he says, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to neglect them.\u201d Instead of Emily getting the connection she is looking for, she gets smacked in the face with his stupid, sarcastic answers. Shane has the sense of humor of an 8-year-old who is made to sit in the back of the class so that no one will notice he spends all day picking his nose. It\u2019s just all passive-aggressive jokes and stupid plays on semantics. For instance, he gets mad that Emily says he\u2019s always sarcastic. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s satire, which is jokes at the expense of others. So it\u2019s not always sarcasm.\u201d\n\nHe may not mean any of these cutting jokes, but I can see how Emily, who is not getting everything she wants out of her husband, would be exasperated. Yes, she might be annoying him, but Shane has to realize that his juvenile assaults on his wife, who otherwise seems very patient and understanding, are making him look like Lex Luthor with a bad case of dandruff. If I were Emily and he called me the Wicked Witch of the West, I would try to drop a house on that Mormon Munchkin faster than Vicki can repeat a rumor.", "description": "This episode is just littered with family fights that will never end.
