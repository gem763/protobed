Trump\u2019s half-joking fear bursts into view", "language": "en", "text": "Trump thrust his relationship with the vice president back into the spotlight last week, when the embattled president nudged reporters during a United Nations news conference to \u201cask for VP Pence\u2019s conversation, because he had a couple conversations also\u201d with Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe out-of-the-blue reference triggered questions about the vice president\u2019s role in the latest mess and the unusual relationship between the pair of leaders. If Trump falls alone, Pence becomes the 46th president of the United States \u2014 a development many mainstream Republicans would prefer. If Trump and Pence go down together or in quick succession, it\u2019s President Nancy Pelosi \u2014 a prospect that would not be lost on Senate Republicans voting on whether to oust their party\u2019s leaders\u2026\n\n\u201cHe tends to flash this paranoia every now and then that Pence is after the job,\u201d Lobianco said. \u201cIt\u2019s like joking not-joking. But I was shocked that he was so out in the open this time.\u201d\u2026\n\nA senior administration official dismissed the notion that Trump would throw Pence under the bus if he ever sensed disloyalty. \u201cThat is silly. It\u2019s the opposite, meaning that [Pence\u2019s] calls are fine, too,\u201d the official said of Trump\u2019s latest remark. \u201cThink this through: POTUS and VP are gone and Pelosi becomes president? Please.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": ""}
