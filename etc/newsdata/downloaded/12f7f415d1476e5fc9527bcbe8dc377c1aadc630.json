REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nJudge Richard Leon of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had been examining a government plan announced in October to allow the merger on condition that Aetna sell its Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc (WCG.N). Both deals have already closed.\n\nLeon had initially balked at approving the merger conditions and insisted on hearing from critics of the deal, but finally decided to grant the motion to approve the consent agreement.\n\nBut he took aim at the common practice of companies\u2019 closing multibillion-dollar deals while the court review, required by the Tunney Act, was still in process.\n\n\u201cIf the Tunney Act is to mean anything,\u201d Leon wrote, \u201cit surely must mean that no court should rubberstamp a consent decree approving the merger of \u2018one of the largest companies in the United States\u2019 and \u2018the nation\u2019s third largest health-insurance company,\u2019 ... simply because the Government requests it!\u201d\n\nIn December, Leon said he was \u201cless convinced\u201d than the government that the asset sale to WellCare would resolve antitrust concerns. Since then, Centene Corp (CNC.N) agreed to acquire WellCare for $15.27 billion.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, said he was pleased with Leon\u2019s decision.\n\nCVS said the judge\u2019s decision reinforced that CVS and Aetna have already merged.\n\n\u201cCVS Health and Aetna have been one company since November 2018, and today\u2019s action by the District Court makes that 100 percent clear. We remain focused on transforming the consumer health care experience in America,\u201d CVS spokesman T.J. Crawford said in an emailed statement.\n\nCritics of the CVS-Aetna deal included the American Medical Association and the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.\n\nAnother critic, U.S. PIRG, expressed skepticism that savings from the merger would end up in consumers\u2019 pockets.\n\n\u201cAgain and again, CVS Caremark has used its market power to both increase the cost of medications for consumers and rip off the government, instead of passing on savings its promised to consumers,\u201d PIRG said in a statement.\n\nPending Leon\u2019s approval, CVS agreed to temporarily allow Aetna to independently make critical product, pricing and personnel decisions.\n\nCVS has been in the process of converting itself into a healthcare company and said in June that it would offer expanded health services such as nutrition counseling and blood pressure screenings in 1,500 stores by the end of 2021.\n\nMost consent agreements that the antitrust agencies strike with companies to resolve competitive concerns are approved by federal courts with little fuss under the 1974 Tunney Act, which requires courts to ensure the agreements are in the public interest.\n\nCompanies generally do not wait for final court approval before closing their transactions.", "description": "A federal judge reviewing a Justice Department decision to allow U.S. pharmacy chain and benefits manager CVS Health Corp to merge with health insurer Aetna said on Wednesday that the agreement was in fact legal under antitrust law.", "authors": ["Diane Bartz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426288749&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF832AS"}
