Can an elite team fix that?", "language": "en", "text": "Last year, Allen and his colleagues reviewed academic literature and came away with 10 evidence-backed general principles that raise meeting satisfaction and effectiveness. He shared a summarised version with the group:\n\nInvite only the people who need to be there. Attendees should be limited to those whose expertise is necessary to accomplish the tasks at hand.\n\nSchedule the meeting to match its goals. A meeting shouldn\u2019t be an hour if the content can be effectively discussed in 27 minutes.\n\nUse your agenda wisely. A detailed agenda circulated beforehand allows people to prepare. It becomes useless if not adhered to. Keep discussions focused and on task.\n\nArrive early \u2013 or at the very least, on time. Tardiness wastes everyone\u2019s time. In addition, research shows that a few minutes of pre-meeting chitchat helps people feel more comfortable speaking up in the discussion later.\n\nDebrief afterwards. Immediately after the meeting, leaders should send minutes and action items, and clearly identify the people responsible for following through.\n\nSide benefits\n\nNow, the uncomfortable question: could the meeting about meetings just have been an email?\n\nOn a purely informational basis: possibly. The first part of the day was spent in various presentations about meetings, group behaviour, and the like, and during the afternoon the participants broke into groups to brainstorm those ideas about how meetings could go better.\n\nIn the group brainstorming sessions, participants tossed out creative ideas: have all participants wear matching jumpsuits to eliminate hierarchy. Trade content at the beginning of a meeting and force colleagues to present one another\u2019s ideas. Give the moderator a heat map to monitor when participants are physically stressed or excited by an idea (yikes). Create a class of professionals whose primary function is to run meetings, or just scrap them altogether and just let chaos unfold.\n\nYet no cohesive theory of meeting disruption emerged. Despite the abundance of collected talent, it will take far more than one eight-hour workshop to invent a viable meeting replacement. That painful weekly check-in is still on your calendar; you will still be able to hear Paul\u2019s dog in the background the next time he works from home.\n\nPerhaps this experiment reinforces the idea that meetings aren\u2019t the ideal subject for 'moonshot'-style thinking. Walshe describes high-performance training as 70% evidence-based practices (for an athlete, good sleep and nutrition; for a meeting goer, showing up on time and sticking to the agenda), 20% experimental training, and 10% out-there longshots. Perhaps the same can apply to meetings \u2013 but, as Allen and others pointed out, most managers still aren\u2019t even nailing the 70%.\n\nBut what would have been lost had they never met at all? Why do any group of people gather in a professional environment?\n\nSome were intrigued by the participant list and excited to meet new potential collaborators. Others wanted to reconnect with people already in their network. For those who focus on meetings for a living, it was a valuable research opportunity. And a few just wanted to get out of their office for a day. And on those fronts, the day was a success.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons people meet that have nothing to do with the information on the agenda. A good meeting is one where everyone wants to be there.", "description": "Surgeons, ex-special forces, NBA coaches: can some of the best minds in human performance come up with a plan to make business meetings better?", "authors": ["Corinne Purtill"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7r/zm/p07rzmpd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
