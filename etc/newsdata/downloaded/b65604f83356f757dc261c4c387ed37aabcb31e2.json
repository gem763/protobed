Read more\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say they\u2019re an item,\u201d Ridge said when asked about the characters\u2019 relationship. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely a gay couple and we\u2019re proud of that.\u201d\n\nFans, as usual, were light years ahead of the curve, and had assumed the characters were a couple after an episode in the first season of the show, Dangerous Business, in which Flix and Orka headed off to visit Flix\u2019s mother, bearing a case of flowers.\n\nThe fact that the characters are nonhuman and the moment of revelation obscure and fleeting reflects other very minor but highly publicised moments of queer inclusivity in Disney narratives, such as a look shared between two characters at the end of the 2017 live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast.\n\nDisney has made moves to include more rounded queer characters in its films, with Tessa Thompson\u2019s Valkyrie slated to be the first bisexual character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Thor: Love and Thunder, expected in 2021.\n\nThe Star Wars franchise has been under pressure for its lack of queer representation, particularly as wishful fans have noticed intense chemistry between characters, such as Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) in 2015\u2019s The Force Awakens, and characters who are queer in the books and comics attached to the universe don\u2019t feature in the blockbuster films.\n\nStar Wars Resistance is set six months before the events depicted in the The Force Awakens. It was nominated for an Emmy this year for outstanding children\u2019s program.", "description": "Producers confirm that Orka and Flix in the animated children\u2019s series are first queer couple in the franchise", "authors": ["Stephanie Convery"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a2ebc614a4dc621a057d93630e6eb8b1f988e2/94_0_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0fdf81cf561d9991590ed3553e07c694", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
