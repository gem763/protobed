The defense, well, it couldn\u2019t stop anyone named Aaron. As the Packers were driving for what would be the fourth touchdown for running back Aaron Jones late in the third quarter, quarterback Aaron Rodgers found his ninth different receiver on the day. As Fox\u2019s Troy Aikman put it: \u201cIf you play soft against Rodgers, he will dice you up all day.\u201d And he did, even with Davante Adams, his favorite receiver, out with turf toe.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSteelers' Mason Rudolph knocked out cold on a scary hit\n\nThe veteran quarterback and first-year coach Matt LaFleur appear to have worked out some of the kinks in their relationship, although Rodgers had a relatively quiet stat line with 238 passing yards and no touchdowns. But what happened to Dallas\u2019s identity? For three quarters on Sunday, star running back Ezekiel Elliott was staring up at the big screen that hangs over the field at AT&T Stadium, as if he expected it to reveal the secret for turning the game around. The NFL\u2019s highest paid running back finished with just 12 carries for 62 yards. After consecutive 100-yard games against the Redskins and Dolphins last month, he has just 97 yards on the ground over the Cowboys\u2019 last two games, including a 12-10 Week 4 loss to the New Orleans Saints.\n\nDallas was scoreless at the half against Green Bay, which meant its high-powered offense notched just 10 points over a six-quarter span. Cameras, as they always do when the Cowboys are playing, lingered on an increasingly bilious Jones in his suite. He watched silently during the offensive struggles, his lips often pursed.\n\nThen came a furious finish, as the teams rolled up 898 yards of total offense. The Packers may have moved to 4-1, but there were questions for the Green Bay defense as the Cowboys passing game poured it on in the fourth quarter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough, and so the Cowboys drop to 3-2, with victories are over teams (the Giants, Redskins and Dolphins) that are a combined 2-12. Their losses are to the leaders of the NFC South (Saints) and North (Packers), teams that are a combined 8-2. Both now have tiebreakers over Dallas.\n\nThe @Packers are now 5-0 all-time in AT&T Stadium (includes one playoff win over the Cowboys and Super Bowl XLV victory over the Steelers).\n\n\n\nThat makes the Packers one of just three teams who are 5-0 or better all-time at one of the NFL's 31 active venues.\n\n\n\n(h/t @EliasSports) pic.twitter.com/y8AzmoTSQp \u2014 ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 7, 2019\n\nDak Prescott\u2019s 463 passing yards included two touchdowns, and he threw for 320 yards in the second half alone, but there were also three interceptions. Jones mentioned last week that he thinks Prescott more closely reminds him of Tom Brady rather than Tony Romo or Troy Aikman, his former quarterbacks, because of his versatility.\n\n\u201cWe know Tom Brady, and he\u2019s no Tom Brady. I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Jones said Friday on 105.3 The Fan. \u201cBut the point is he will evolve and is evolving into a guy that will beat you. He will beat you with different circumstances and different players and different type teams. He will be on teams that have better defense than others. He will be on teams that have better protection than others. I think we got us one in Dak.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Prescott couldn\u2019t beat Green Bay on Sunday, and the two recent losses will raise questions about the identity of a team supposedly built around its running game. Jones was maintaining a brave face, at least.\n\n\u201cThis loss hurts,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut on the other hand, Dak learns from adversities \u2026 He learns from setbacks.\u201d\n\nHis confidence that Prescott will bounce back?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as comfortable as I can be,\u201d Jones said.\n\nBut the Cowboys can\u2019t be as comfortable as they were two weeks ago.\n\nRead more on the NFL from The Post:\n\nAwful on field and directionless off, it\u2019s time for Redskins to face a hard reality\n\nPatriots\u2019 offense \u2018can be a lot better,\u2019 Tom Brady says after win over Redskins\n\nPatriots fans took over FedEx Field and even Tom Brady thought it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019\n\nKey moments from the Redskins\u2019 33-7 loss to the Patriots\n\nAD", "description": "Dallas started 3-0 and was riding high, but consecutive losses to NFC contenders offered a troubling note of caution.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZM7GXTd3iKWGXMw1TlSRTc_Inh8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XP2MBCHIQ4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
