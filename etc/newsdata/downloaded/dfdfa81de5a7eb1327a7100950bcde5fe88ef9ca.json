Manufacturing and agriculture were the two weak spots in the late summer.\n\nReports on consumer spending was \u201cmixed,\u201d with auto sales continuing at a modest pace and \u201csolid\u201d tourism activity. Employment grew at a modest pace, with moderate upward wage growth. Price increases were modest. Businesses said that the impact of recent trade tariffs on Chinese products would not be felt for a few months on prices that consumers pay at the store.\n\nBig picture: Economists generally don\u2019t think that weak manufacturing and agriculture will be enough to push the economy into a ditch. Today\u2019s report fits with the same 2% growth rate seen in the first half of the year.\n\nFed officials are split about how to respond to fears of a sharper downturn, with some urging no rate cut while others push for aggressive easing at the next policy meeting on Sept. 17-18. Most economists think the safest course for the Fed will decide to cut interest rates by a quarter-point at its next policy meeting in two weeks, following up on a similar move in July.\n\nInteresting anecdotes:\n\n\u2022 Retailers in Boston said there was a slowdown in getting products from non-Chinese Asian manufacturers, as ports in these countries were said to be not yet able to handle the increased shipping demand.\n\n\u2022 In New York, a major retailer said that had raised prices for furniture and other big-ticket items but that they were likely to reverse those hikes as consumers were not responding well.\n\n\u2022 In Cleveland, manufacturers were not laying off workers but were taking other steps to reduce labor such as fewer shirts, reduced overtime, fewer temporary employees and shrinkage by attrition.\n\n\u2022 Ports in the Richmond district saw robust activity from strong import volumes.\n\n\u2022 Retailers in Atlanta detected some uncertainty among consumers about the geopolitical environment, and expressed some concern about the upcoming holiday season.\n\n\u2022 Some retailers in Chicago were starting to incrementally increase prices to avoid a \u2018single noticeable increase\u2019 when tariffs come into effect.\n\nMarket reaction: Stocks were higher on hopes of possible end to violent protests in Hong Kong.
