Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas doubled down Sunday on his call for a mandatory buyback of \u201cassault weapons,\u201d including AK-47 and AR-15 firearms, in response to the deadly shooting Saturday in West Texas.\n\n\u201cYes, this is f\u2013ed up,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke is running as a candidate in the 2020 presidential race. \u201cIf we don\u2019t call it out for what it is, if we\u2019re not able to speak clearly, if we\u2019re not able to act decisively, then we will continue to have this kind of bloodshed in America. And I cannot accept that.\u201d\n\nA gunman shot and killed seven people and wounded 19 others after a traffic stop Saturday in Midland, Texas. The gunman shot at police and at random passersby before abandoning his vehicle and hijacking a postal truck. He was killed in a shootout with law enforcement outside a movie theater in Odessa.\n\nIn addition to universal background checks and a federal red-flag law, Mr. O\u2019Rourke has called for the federal government to buy back as many as 15 million semiautomatic rifles, including AK-47 and AR-15 models, as well as gun-registry and licensing systems.\n\n\u201cIt is really important that we buy back those weapons of war that are out on our streets right now \u2014 millions of them,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to expand background checks or prevent their further sales, Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, while acknowledging that such steps would be helpful. \u201cWeapons of war\u201d must not be on the streets at all, he said.\n\n\u201cIf millions of them remain on the streets, they will still be instruments of terror that terrify and terrorize us and take our lives, and I will not accept that,\u201d he said.\n\nNot long ago, the idea of compelling gun owners to relinquish their firearms under the threat of government force, even if there were financial reimbursement, would have been anathema. But the prospect has gained steam on the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign trail, fueled by recent mass shootings.\n\nAt least two candidates who have since dropped out of the presidential race, Rep. Eric Swalwell of California and Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, have expressed support for mandatory firearms buybacks.\n\nSuch proposals have run into opposition from gun-rights groups and Republicans. Sen. Rick Scott, Florida Republican, said Sunday that he opposed proposals to wrest firearms from law-abiding gun owners.\n\n\u201cI believe in the Second Amendment. I don\u2019t want to take guns away from law-abiding citizens. I want to focus on the people that have mental illness. That\u2019s my focus,\u201d Mr. Scott said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he thought there were \u201ctoo many guns,\u201d Mr. Scott said, \u201cThere\u2019s too many people that have mental illnesses that we\u2019re somehow not addressing, and they have access to weapons, and they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOthers have said that pushing for mandatory buybacks could backfire politically on Democrats, potentially dooming any gun control package by \u201cmaking millions of law-abiding firearm owners criminals for not selling their rifles back to the federal government,\u201d as USA Today said in an Aug. 22 editorial.\n\nAbout 393 million firearms are in the hands of private U.S. owners, more than one for every person in the country, according to a 2018 Small Arms Survey.\n\nAsked whether such a plan went too far, Mr. O\u2019Rourke said that \u201cpeople live in terror now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than I worry about the politics or the polling, more than I care about what the NRA has to say on this, I care for my kids and this country,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
