Turkey is backing the Tripoli forces.\n\nMitiga airport, the only working airport in Tripoli, was also targeted in the early hours of Monday, an eastern military source told Reuters. It has been closed due to continued air strikes.\n\nHaftar and his backers say they are trying to free the capital from armed groups which they blame for destabilising Libya since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.\n\nHaftar\u2019s critics accuse him of trying to seize power through a military coup, deepening a conflict between factions based in the east and west of the sprawling North African country.\n\nSirte, Gaddafi\u2019s birth place, was a stronghold for Islamic State militants until Tripoli-forces backed by U.S. airstrikes expelled the group in December 2016.\n\nThe coastal city lies at the unofficial border of areas of influence of the Tripoli forces in western Libya and the LNA controlling the east, home to a parallel government.", "description": "Eastern Libyan forces on Monday mounted air strikes on positions in the central city of Sirte held by the internationally recognised government, an official and residents said, widening a conflict engulfing the capital Tripoli.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
