It is expected to determine whether the world\u2019s two largest economies are starting to chart a path out of their 14-month trade war or headed for new and higher tariffs on each others\u2019 goods.\n\nCancellation of the Chinese agriculture visits, which were seen as potentially leading to increased purchases of U.S. soybeans and pork, caused Wall Street\u2019s main stock indexes to fall as early optimism about the talks faded.\n\nGrain and soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade and livestock futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also slumped. China is the world\u2019s largest pork market and the largest importer of soybeans.\n\n\u2018COMPLETE DEAL\u2019\n\nBefore the talks started, some reports had suggested that an interim deal was being considered, involving Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods, some improvements in Chinese market access and an easing of U.S. sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]\n\nBut U.S. President Donald Trump made clear on Friday that purchases would not be enough for him to end his punitive tariffs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a complete deal. I\u2019m not looking for a partial deal,\u201d he told reporters, adding that he did not need a deal to happen before the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSpeaking at a White House meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Trump touted the billions of dollars in U.S. tariff receipts on Chinese imports, adding that the total would soon reach $100 billion.\n\n\u201cI will say this: we\u2019re making a lot of progress with China,\u201d the Republican president said.\n\nThe Trump administration and China\u2019s Communist Party remain far apart on issues that are the basis of their trade dispute, including the U.S. declaring some Chinese state companies national security risks, and Beijing\u2019s refusal to revamp its economic model by eliminating subsidies for state companies.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters while meeting with Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Scott Morrison in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nUSTR issued three Federal Register notices on Friday to exclude a wide range of products from tariffs in response to requests from U.S. companies, which argued that the levies would cause economic hardship.\n\nThe 437 exempted products range from printed circuit boards for computer graphics processors to dog collars, laminated wood flooring and miniature Christmas lights.\n\nThe United States is asking that China substantially increase purchases of American soybeans and other farm commodities, a person with knowledge of the planned discussions told Reuters.", "description": "A U.S.-China trade deal appeared elusive on Friday after Chinese officials unexpectedly cancelled a visit to farms in Montana and Nebraska as deputy trade negotiators wrapped up two days of negotiations in Washington.", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432051499&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1QH", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
