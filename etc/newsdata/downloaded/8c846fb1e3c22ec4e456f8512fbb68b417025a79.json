He reiterated his call for the prime minister to resign.\n\nThe buoyant speech, which was brought forward a day following the unprecedented legal decision, allowed Corbyn to exit the conference on a high after three days that have been dominated by bitter tribal divisions and rancor over its Brexit policy. To cheers, Corbyn said the prime minister would \"never shut down our democracy or silence the voices of the people.\" Parliament will sit again on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m. local time.\n\nActivists in the conference hall shouted \"Johnson out\" as Corbyn described Johnson's administration as a \"born-to-rule government of the entitled who believe that the rules they set for everyone else don\u2019t apply to them.\"\n\nLegislation passed by MPs before Boris Johnson illegally closed down parliament was \"clearly essential,\" the Labour leader added. \"After what has taken place no one can trust this government and this prime minister not to use this crisis of their own making and drive our country over a no-deal cliff edge in five weeks\u2019 time,\" he said.\n\nReferring to Johnson's push for an early trade deal with the U.S., the Labour leader told his party faithful that a no-deal Brexit was really \"a Trump Deal Brexit.\" Corbyn claimed the U.S. president was \"delighted to have a compliant British prime minister in his back pocket.\"\n\nHe also used his speech to justify his party's Brexit policy, which was decided during an acrimonious and chaotic series of votes Monday. Labour's party conference has been riven by its own Brexit splits and Corbyn had to face down a threat on Monday to make the party unambiguously pro-Remain.\n\nAllies rallied around his preferred policy to renegotiate a Brexit deal with the European Union, and put it to the country within six months of winning power. \"Only a vote for Labour will deliver a public vote on Brexit,\" Corbyn said.\n\nCorbyn said Labour offered \"real change,\" promising \"bold, radical measures.\" The big new announcement of the speech was a plan to create a publicly-owned drugs company to supply the National Health Service with cheaper medicines.", "description": "The Labour leader attacked the Tory \u2018born-to-rule government of the entitled,\u2019 saying it could not be trusted.", "authors": ["Annabelle Dickson", "Rosa Prince"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170772386-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
