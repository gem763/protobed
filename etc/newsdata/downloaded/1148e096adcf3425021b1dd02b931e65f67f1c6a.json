And suddenly he turns the entire room of grovelling, curmudgeoned, angry men into howling schoolgirls.'\n\nShe added: 'It was just electrifying to see that kind of personality, change the complete energy of the room. So that's when I was like, ''who is this guy? I gotta go say hi''.\n\n'And I walked right over and I said, Mr Johnson, my name is Jennifer Arcuri. I would really love it if you'd come speak at my venture capital event.'\n\nMr Johnson was given until Monday to explain why he wants to keep secret the details of his relationship with entrepreneur Ms Arcuri.\n\nJennifer Arcuri and Boris Johnson (pictured in 2014).

The assembly demanded to know the reasons.\n\nLabour's Len Duvall, chairman of the assembly's oversight committee, wrote to the PM warning he had 'not provided the information requested' and gave him the Monday deadline.\n\nMr Johnson has denied any impropriety in his role but has repeatedly failed to deny having sex with the businesswoman, who told the Mail this week that Mr Johnson was her Henry VIII - and she was his Anne Boleyn.\n\n\u2018Anne Boleyn made Henry VIII literally crazy for six years because she wouldn\u2019t give him her virtue,' Ms Arcuri said. 'She never gave away too much of herself because she knew that if she did, what happened to her sister would happen to her.\u2019\n\nThe revelation comes as lawyers for Mr Johnson have tried to get out of assisting an official inquiry into his links with Ms Arcuri \u2013 by claiming it has no right to question him (pictured: Ms Arcuri in the Back Boris 2012 campaign)\n\nMs Arcuri says that any grants given to her firm were 'above board' (pictured: Miss Arcuri in a July 2013 photoshoot)\n\nThe Californian added that the 'last thing' she wanted to be was 'the girl that showed up, sh***ed him and left\u2019, insisting that she was the one who brought the axe down on their 'unique connection'.\n\nJohnson spoke at four events run by Innotech, Ms Arcuri's start-up company - and the pair visited Kuala Lumpur, New York and Tel Aviv on three EU-funded trade missions.\n\nThe revelation comes as lawyers for Mr Johnson have tried to get out of assisting an official inquiry into his links with Ms Arcuri \u2013 by claiming it has no right to question him.\n\nThe Prime Minister's law firm Atkins Thomson have written a letter to the chairman of the Greater London Authority (GLA) oversight committee Len Duvall after the body requested 'extensive' details of Mr Johnson's relationship with the 34-year-old.\n\nThe letter adds: 'It appears to us the GLA oversight committee may be exceeding their remit or overstepping the mark by requiring information of our client.'\n\nThe GLA committee wrote to Mr Johnson over claims that as London mayor he 'failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in relation to the awarding of public funds' to Miss Arcuri.\n\nAnd the body requested 'details and a timeline of all contact with Jennifer Arcuri during your period of office as Mayor of London, including personal, social and professional'.\n\nIt came as Miss Arcuri gave an exclusive interview to the Mail in which she referred to herself as 'Boris's Anne Boleyn', describing how the second wife of Henry VIII had refused to 'give him her virtue'\n\nJennifer Arcuri meets Boris Johnson at Excel World Islamic Economic Forum, London, October 2013\n\nMr Johnson this week responded by sending material to the committee \u2013 but marked it 'private and confidential' and 'Not for publication'. Mr Duvall of the GLA committee has already written to him demanding to know why he marked the information as secret.\n\nMr Johnson has consistently denied any impropriety \u2013 but has singularly failed to deny having an affair with Miss Arcuri.\n\nMiss Arcuri also says that any grants given to her firm were 'above board'.\n\nThe letter from Mr Johnson's lawyers, sent this week and leaked to the Huffington Post, said their client 'intends to fully cooperate with the Director General of the Independent Office for Police Conduct in its separate inquiry into the PM's links to Arcuri.'", "description": "The image of Boris Johnson and Jennifer Arcuri's first meeting was taken at a gathering of venture capitalists in central London while Mr Johnson was Mayor in October 2011.", "authors": ["Henry Martin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/11/19622688-0-image-a-7_1570875480143.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
