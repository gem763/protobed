It was triggered by activity near the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, called Sagittarius A*, which is over four million times as massive as the Sun.\n\nThe event reveals that the Milky Way\u2019s core is more dynamic and energetic than expected. It \u201cmust have been a bit like a lighthouse beam,\u201d said Joss Bland-Hawthorn, director of the Sydney Institute for Astronomy and lead author of a forthcoming study in The Astrophysical Journal about the flare, in a statement.\n\nThe exact origins of the flare are unknown, but it would have required \u201ca lot of gas to suddenly be dumped into the galactic nucleus,\u201d said Bland-Hawthorn in an email. For instance, a giant molecular cloud may have gotten too close to Sagittarius A*, only to be consumed and spit out from both poles of the galaxy in this gigantic flare.\n\nBland-Hawthorn and his colleagues mapped out the effects of the explosion on the Magellanic Stream, a massive river of gas and dust that orbits the Milky Way at a distance of 200,000 light years.\n\nDespite how far away the stream is from the Milky Way\u2019s core, the team observed that some parts of this gassy river were energized by the pyrotechnic event. Gas in the stream appears to be ionized, or stripped of electrons, signaling that the flare recently influenced it.\n\nBland-Hawthorn and his colleagues first published a paper about the aftermath of this potential flare event in 2013. The new study includes \u201cnew observations and a better understanding\u201d of the flare\u2019s impact on the Magellanic Stream, as well as updates to \u201cthe likely timescale for the Seyfert flare,\u201d the team said in the study.\n\n\u201cIt's likely that the flare was about as bright as could be expected for a supermassive black hole [of Sagittarius A*\u2019s mass],\u201d said co-author Philip Maloney, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado Boulder, in an email.\n\nSo if you were one of humanity\u2019s early ancestors living at this time, such as the Australopithecines, what exactly would you see in the night sky?\n\nMaloney said that most of the optical light from the blast would be absorbed by the dust and gas surrounding the galactic nucleus. \u201cThe flare might have been comparable (say, one-tenth as bright or so) to the full Moon in brightness,\u201d he speculated, \u201calthough of course it would be spread over a much larger area of the sky.\u201d\n\nHowever, if you could transport X-ray observatories back in time 3.5 million years, you would capture a much more dazzling glimpse of the flare\u2019s brilliant jets. This is because about 10% of the flare\u2019s total luminosity was emitted by high-energy X-rays, Maloney explained, which are much less likely to be blocked by gas and dust.\n\n\u201cThe flare would be extremely bright to modern X-ray telescopes, unless there was a very large amount of gas lying along our line of sight to it\u2014which can happen, but it takes a lot of gas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we would still be able to see the effects of the flare as it ionized and heated the gas away from the plane, the fading remnants of which we still see today.\u201d", "description": "The explosion stretched for hundreds of thousands of light years into space and \u201cmust have been a bit like a lighthouse beam,\u201d researchers say in a new study.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9b5b2239335f000a93c1e3/lede/1570462500205-explosion.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
