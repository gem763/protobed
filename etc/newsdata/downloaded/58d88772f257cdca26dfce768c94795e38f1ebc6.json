The house sits in the middle of town on the business route of a state highway, but it is surrounded by acres of old forest, close to everything but seemingly miles away, an oasis of natural beauty in the middle of a small Southern town.\n\nThe house was built in 1847 by the owner of a plantation. This plantation was only 12 miles away but on lower ground near swamps when many believed that the \u201cmiasma\u201d (malaria) of the lowlands could be avoided in the higher pineland.\n\nAD\n\nThe house sits on a hill that protects it from flooding, more important now than ever in this time of climate crisis. And this beautiful house built of heart pine with wooden pegs and dowels, has escaped devastation for 172 years from hurricanes, earthquakes and General Sherman. We are dedicated to its preservation that it has surely earned.\n\nIn this new occasional feature, we ask homeowners what they love most about their home. If you\u2019d like to share your story, please send a high-resolution photo of the room/feature you love (preferably with you in the photo, too) and 250 to 300 words describing the space and why you love it to: mlerner@gmail.com.\n\nAD", "description": "TOWN SQUARE | The acoustics are spellbinding, allowing us to host chamber music recitals in the music room, and all the notes carry to the far reaches of the house and spill onto the porches on four sides of the house.", "authors": ["Michele Lerner"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FpCk2b8TMYvSI3Bof-SDL3FglAs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AQS4S7XF6QI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
