I. \u201cSo That\u2019s Just One Of My Losses\u201d Clyde Ross was born in 1923, the seventh of 13 children, near Clarksdale, Mississippi, the home of the blues. Ross\u2019s parents owned and farmed a 40-acre tract of land, flush with cows, hogs, and mules. Ross\u2019s mother would drive to Clarksdale to do her shopping in a horse and buggy, in which she invested all the pride one might place in a Cadillac. The family owned another horse, with a red coat, which they gave to Clyde. The Ross family wanted for little, save that which all black families in the Deep South then desperately desired\u2014the protection of the law. In the 1920s, Jim Crow Mississippi was, in all facets of society, a kleptocracy. The majority of the people in the state were perpetually robbed of the vote\u2014a hijacking engineered through the trickery of the poll tax and the muscle of the lynch mob. Between 1882 and 1968, more black people were lynched in Mississippi than in any other state. \u201cYou and I know what\u2019s the best way to keep the nigger from voting,\u201d blustered Theodore Bilbo, a Mississippi senator and a proud Klansman. \u201cYou do it the night before the election.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s regime partnered robbery of the franchise with robbery of the purse. Many of Mississippi\u2019s black farmers lived in debt peonage, under the sway of cotton kings who were at once their landlords, their employers, and their primary merchants. Tools and necessities were advanced against the return on the crop, which was determined by the employer. When farmers were deemed to be in debt\u2014and they often were\u2014the negative balance was then carried over to the next season. A man or woman who protested this arrangement did so at the risk of grave injury or death. Refusing to work meant arrest under vagrancy laws and forced labor under the state\u2019s penal system. Well into the 20th century, black people spoke of their flight from Mississippi in much the same manner as their runagate ancestors had. In her 2010 book, The Warmth of Other Suns, Isabel Wilkerson tells the story of Eddie Earvin, a spinach picker who fled Mississippi in 1963, after being made to work at gunpoint. \u201cYou didn\u2019t talk about it or tell nobody,\u201d Earvin said. \u201cYou had to sneak away.\u201d \u201cSome of the land taken from black families has become a country club in Virginia,\u201d the AP reported. When Clyde Ross was still a child, Mississippi authorities claimed his father owed $3,000 in back taxes. The elder Ross could not read. He did not have a lawyer. He did not know anyone at the local courthouse. He could not expect the police to be impartial. Effectively, the Ross family had no way to contest the claim and no protection under the law. The authorities seized the land. They seized the buggy. They took the cows, hogs, and mules. And so for the upkeep of separate but equal, the entire Ross family was reduced to sharecropping.\n\nThis was hardly unusual. In 2001, the Associated Press published a three-part investigation into the theft of black-owned land stretching back to the antebellum period. The series documented some 406 victims and 24,000 acres of land valued at tens of millions of dollars. The land was taken through means ranging from legal chicanery to terrorism. \u201cSome of the land taken from black families has become a country club in Virginia,\u201d the AP reported, as well as \u201coil fields in Mississippi\u201d and \u201ca baseball spring training facility in Florida.\u201d A year-by-year catalogue of some of the magazine's most momentous work.\n\nRead more Clyde Ross was a smart child. His teacher thought he should attend a more challenging school. There was very little support for educating black people in Mississippi. But Julius Rosenwald, a part owner of Sears, Roebuck, had begun an ambitious effort to build schools for black children throughout the South. Ross\u2019s teacher believed he should attend the local Rosenwald school. It was too far for Ross to walk and get back in time to work in the fields. Local white children had a school bus. Clyde Ross did not, and thus lost the chance to better his education. Then, when Ross was 10 years old, a group of white men demanded his only childhood possession\u2014the horse with the red coat. \u201cYou can\u2019t have this horse. We want it,\u201d one of the white men said. They gave Ross\u2019s father $17. \u201cI did everything for that horse,\u201d Ross told me. \u201cEverything. And they took him. Put him on the racetrack. I never did know what happened to him after that, but I know they didn\u2019t bring him back. So that\u2019s just one of my losses.\u201d\n\nThe losses mounted. As sharecroppers, the Ross family saw their wages treated as the landlord\u2019s slush fund. Landowners were supposed to split the profits from the cotton fields with sharecroppers. But bales would often disappear during the count, or the split might be altered on a whim. If cotton was selling for 50 cents a pound, the Ross family might get 15 cents, or only five. One year Ross\u2019s mother promised to buy him a $7 suit for a summer program at their church. She ordered the suit by mail. But that year Ross\u2019s family was paid only five cents a pound for cotton. The mailman arrived with the suit. The Rosses could not pay. The suit was sent back. Clyde Ross did not go to the church program. reporter\u2019s notebook\n\nElegant Racism\n\n\u201cIf you sought to advantage one group of Americans and disadvantage another, you could scarcely choose a more graceful method than housing discrimination.\u201d\n\nRead more It was in these early years that Ross began to understand himself as an American\u2014he did not live under the blind decree of justice, but under the heel of a regime that elevated armed robbery to a governing principle. He thought about fighting. \u201cJust be quiet,\u201d his father told him. \u201cBecause they\u2019ll come and kill us all.\u201d\n\nClyde Ross grew. He was drafted into the Army. The draft officials offered him an exemption if he stayed home and worked. He preferred to take his chances with war. He was stationed in California. He found that he could go into stores without being bothered. He could walk the streets without being harassed. He could go into a restaurant and receive service. Ross was shipped off to Guam. He fought in World War II to save the world from tyranny. But when he returned to Clarksdale, he found that tyranny had followed him home. This was 1947, eight years before Mississippi lynched Emmett Till and tossed his broken body into the Tallahatchie River. The Great Migration, a mass exodus of 6 million African Americans that spanned most of the 20th century, was now in its second wave. The black pilgrims did not journey north simply seeking better wages and work, or bright lights and big adventures. They were fleeing the acquisitive warlords of the South. They were seeking the protection of the law. Clyde Ross was among them. He came to Chicago in 1947 and took a job as a taster at Campbell\u2019s Soup. He made a stable wage. He married. He had children. His paycheck was his own. No Klansmen stripped him of the vote. When he walked down the street, he did not have to move because a white man was walking past. He did not have to take off his hat or avert his gaze. His journey from peonage to full citizenship seemed near-complete. Only one item was missing\u2014a home, that final badge of entry into the sacred order of the American middle class of the Eisenhower years.\n\nIn 1961, Ross and his wife bought a house in North Lawndale, a bustling community on Chicago\u2019s West Side. North Lawndale had long been a predominantly Jewish neighborhood, but a handful of middle-class African Americans had lived there starting in the \u201940s. The community was anchored by the sprawling Sears, Roebuck headquarters. North Lawndale\u2019s Jewish People\u2019s Institute actively encouraged blacks to move into the neighborhood, seeking to make it a \u201cpilot community for interracial living.\u201d In the battle for integration then being fought around the country, North Lawndale seemed to offer promising terrain. But out in the tall grass, highwaymen, nefarious as any Clarksdale kleptocrat, were lying in wait. From the 1930s through the 1960s, black people across the country were largely cut out of the legitimate home-mortgage market. Three months after Clyde Ross moved into his house, the boiler blew out. This would normally be a homeowner\u2019s responsibility, but in fact, Ross was not really a homeowner. His payments were made to the seller, not the bank. And Ross had not signed a normal mortgage. He\u2019d bought \u201con contract\u201d: a predatory agreement that combined all the responsibilities of homeownership with all the disadvantages of renting\u2014while offering the benefits of neither. Ross had bought his house for $27,500. The seller, not the previous homeowner but a new kind of middleman, had bought it for only $12,000 six months before selling it to Ross. In a contract sale, the seller kept the deed until the contract was paid in full\u2014and, unlike with a normal mortgage, Ross would acquire no equity in the meantime. If he missed a single payment, he would immediately forfeit his $1,000 down payment, all his monthly payments, and the property itself.\n\nThe men who peddled contracts in North Lawndale would sell homes at inflated prices and then evict families who could not pay\u2014taking their down payment and their monthly installments as profit. Then they\u2019d bring in another black family, rinse, and repeat. \u201cHe loads them up with payments they can\u2019t meet,\u201d an office secretary told The Chicago Daily News of her boss, the speculator Lou Fushanis, in 1963. \u201cThen he takes the property away from them. He\u2019s sold some of the buildings three or four times.\u201d Ross had tried to get a legitimate mortgage in another neighborhood, but was told by a loan officer that there was no financing available. The truth was that there was no financing for people like Clyde Ross. From the 1930s through the 1960s, black people across the country were largely cut out of the legitimate home-mortgage market through means both legal and extralegal. Chicago whites employed every measure, from \u201crestrictive covenants\u201d to bombings, to keep their neighborhoods segregated. Their efforts were buttressed by the federal government. In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration. The FHA insured private mortgages, causing a drop in interest rates and a decline in the size of the down payment required to buy a house. But an insured mortgage was not a possibility for Clyde Ross. The FHA had adopted a system of maps that rated neighborhoods according to their perceived stability. On the maps, green areas, rated \u201cA,\u201d indicated \u201cin demand\u201d neighborhoods that, as one appraiser put it, lacked \u201ca single foreigner or Negro.\u201d These neighborhoods were considered excellent prospects for insurance. Neighborhoods where black people lived were rated \u201cD\u201d and were usually considered ineligible for FHA backing. They were colored in red. Neither the percentage of black people living there nor their social class mattered. Black people were viewed as a contagion. Redlining went beyond FHA-backed loans and spread to the entire mortgage industry, which was already rife with racism, excluding black people from most legitimate means of obtaining a mortgage. Explore Redlining in Chicago \u201cA government offering such bounty to builders and lenders could have required compliance with a nondiscrimination policy,\u201d Charles Abrams, the urban-studies expert who helped create the New York City Housing Authority, wrote in 1955. \u201cInstead, the FHA adopted a racial policy that could well have been culled from the Nuremberg laws.\u201d\n\nThe devastating effects are cogently outlined by Melvin L. Oliver and Thomas M. Shapiro in their 1995 book, Black Wealth/White Wealth: Locked out of the greatest mass-based opportunity for wealth accumulation in American history, African Americans who desired and were able to afford home ownership found themselves consigned to central-city communities where their investments were affected by the \u201cself-fulfilling prophecies\u201d of the FHA appraisers: cut off from sources of new investment[,] their homes and communities deteriorated and lost value in comparison to those homes and communities that FHA appraisers deemed desirable. In Chicago and across the country, whites looking to achieve the American dream could rely on a legitimate credit system backed by the government. Blacks were herded into the sights of unscrupulous lenders who took them for money and for sport. \u201cIt was like people who like to go out and shoot lions in Africa. It was the same thrill,\u201d a housing attorney told the historian Beryl Satter in her 2009 book, Family Properties. \u201cThe thrill of the chase and the kill.\u201d reporter\u2019s notebook\n\nThe American Case Against a Black Middle Class\n\n\u201cWhen a black family in Chicago saves up enough to move out of the crowded slums into Cicero, the neighborhood riots.\u201d\n\nRead more The kill was profitable. At the time of his death, Lou Fushanis owned more than 600 properties, many of them in North Lawndale, and his estate was estimated to be worth $3 million. He\u2019d made much of this money by exploiting the frustrated hopes of black migrants like Clyde Ross. During this period, according to one estimate, 85 percent of all black home buyers who bought in Chicago bought on contract. \u201cIf anybody who is well established in this business in Chicago doesn\u2019t earn $100,000 a year,\u201d a contract seller told The Saturday Evening Post in 1962, \u201che is loafing.\u201d\n\nContract sellers became rich. North Lawndale became a ghetto. Clyde Ross still lives there. He still owns his home. He is 91, and the emblems of survival are all around him\u2014awards for service in his community, pictures of his children in cap and gown. But when I asked him about his home in North Lawndale, I heard only anarchy. \u201cWe were ashamed. We did not want anyone to know that we were that ignorant,\u201d Ross told me. He was sitting at his dining-room table. His glasses were as thick as his Clarksdale drawl. \u201cI\u2019d come out of Mississippi where there was one mess, and come up here and got in another mess. So how dumb am I? I didn\u2019t want anyone to know how dumb I was. \u201cWhen I found myself caught up in it, I said, \u2018How? I just left this mess. I just left no laws. And no regard. And then I come here and get cheated wide open.\u2019 I would probably want to do some harm to some people, you know, if I had been violent like some of us. I thought, \u2018Man, I got caught up in this stuff. I can\u2019t even take care of my kids.\u2019 I didn\u2019t have enough for my kids. You could fall through the cracks easy fighting these white people. And no law.\u201d Blacks were herded into the sights of unscrupulous lenders who took them for money and for sport. But fight Clyde Ross did. In 1968 he joined the newly formed Contract Buyers League\u2014a collection of black homeowners on Chicago\u2019s South and West Sides, all of whom had been locked into the same system of predation. There was Howell Collins, whose contract called for him to pay $25,500 for a house that a speculator had bought for $14,500. There was Ruth Wells, who\u2019d managed to pay out half her contract, expecting a mortgage, only to suddenly see an insurance bill materialize out of thin air\u2014a requirement the seller had added without Wells\u2019s knowledge. Contract sellers used every tool at their disposal to pilfer from their clients. They scared white residents into selling low. They lied about properties\u2019 compliance with building codes, then left the buyer responsible when city inspectors arrived. They presented themselves as real-estate brokers, when in fact they were the owners. They guided their clients to lawyers who were in on the scheme.\n\nThe Contract Buyers League fought back. Members\u2014who would eventually number more than 500\u2014went out to the posh suburbs where the speculators lived and embarrassed them by knocking on their neighbors\u2019 doors and informing them of the details of the contract-lending trade. They refused to pay their installments, instead holding monthly payments in an escrow account. Then they brought a suit against the contract sellers, accusing them of buying properties and reselling in such a manner \u201cto reap from members of the Negro race large and unjust profits.\u201d Video: The Contract Buyers League\n\nIn return for the \u201cdeprivations of their rights and privileges under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments,\u201d the league demanded \u201cprayers for relief\u201d\u2014payback of all moneys paid on contracts and all moneys paid for structural improvement of properties, at 6 percent interest minus a \u201cfair, non-discriminatory\u201d rental price for time of occupation. Moreover, the league asked the court to adjudge that the defendants had \u201cacted willfully and maliciously and that malice is the gist of this action.\u201d\n\nRoss and the Contract Buyers League were no longer appealing to the government simply for equality. They were no longer fleeing in hopes of a better deal elsewhere. They were charging society with a crime against their community. They wanted the crime publicly ruled as such. They wanted the crime\u2019s executors declared to be offensive to society. And they wanted restitution for the great injury brought upon them by said offenders. In 1968, Clyde Ross and the Contract Buyers League were no longer simply seeking the protection of the law. They were seeking reparations. II. \u201cA Difference of Kind, Not Degree\u201d According to the most-recent statistics, North Lawndale is now on the wrong end of virtually every socioeconomic indicator. In 1930 its population was 112,000. Today it is 36,000. The halcyon talk of \u201cinterracial living\u201d is dead. The neighborhood is 92 percent black. Its homicide rate is 45 per 100,000\u2014triple the rate of the city as a whole. The infant-mortality rate is 14 per 1,000\u2014more than twice the national average. Forty-three percent of the people in North Lawndale live below the poverty line\u2014double Chicago\u2019s overall rate. Forty-five percent of all households are on food stamps\u2014nearly three times the rate of the city at large. Sears, Roebuck left the neighborhood in 1987, taking 1,800 jobs with it. Kids in North Lawndale need not be confused about their prospects: Cook County\u2019s Juvenile Temporary Detention Center sits directly adjacent to the neighborhood.\n\nNorth Lawndale is an extreme portrait of the trends that ail black Chicago. Such is the magnitude of these ailments that it can be said that blacks and whites do not inhabit the same city. The average per capita income of Chicago\u2019s white neighborhoods is almost three times that of its black neighborhoods. When the Harvard sociologist Robert J. Sampson examined incarceration rates in Chicago in his 2012 book, Great American City, he found that a black neighborhood with one of the highest incarceration rates (West Garfield Park) had a rate more than 40 times as high as the white neighborhood with the highest rate (Clearing). \u201cThis is a staggering differential, even for community-level comparisons,\u201d Sampson writes. \u201cA difference of kind, not degree.\u201d\n\nInteractive Census Map\n\nIn other words, Chicago\u2019s impoverished black neighborhoods\u2014characterized by high unemployment and households headed by single parents\u2014are not simply poor; they are \u201cecologically distinct.\u201d This \u201cis not simply the same thing as low economic status,\u201d writes Sampson. \u201cIn this pattern Chicago is not alone.\u201d\n\nThe lives of black Americans are better than they were half a century ago. The humiliation of Whites Only signs are gone. Rates of black poverty have decreased. Black teen-pregnancy rates are at record lows\u2014and the gap between black and white teen-pregnancy rates has shrunk significantly. But such progress rests on a shaky foundation, and fault lines are everywhere. The income gap between black and white households is roughly the same today as it was in 1970. Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University, studied children born from 1955 through 1970 and found that 4 percent of whites and 62 percent of blacks across America had been raised in poor neighborhoods. A generation later, the same study showed, virtually nothing had changed. And whereas whites born into affluent neighborhoods tended to remain in affluent neighborhoods, blacks tended to fall out of them. This is not surprising. Black families, regardless of income, are significantly less wealthy than white families. The Pew Research Center estimates that white households are worth roughly 20 times as much as black households, and that whereas only 15 percent of whites have zero or negative wealth, more than a third of blacks do. Effectively, the black family in America is working without a safety net. When financial calamity strikes\u2014a medical emergency, divorce, job loss\u2014the fall is precipitous. And just as black families of all incomes remain handicapped by a lack of wealth, so too do they remain handicapped by their restricted choice of neighborhood. Black people with upper-middle-class incomes do not generally live in upper-middle-class neighborhoods. Sharkey\u2019s research shows that black families making $100,000 typically live in the kinds of neighborhoods inhabited by white families making $30,000. \u201cBlacks and whites inhabit such different neighborhoods,\u201d Sharkey writes, \u201cthat it is not possible to compare the economic outcomes of black and white children.\u201d A national real-estate association advised not to sell to \u201ca colored man of means who was giving his children a college education.\u201d The implications are chilling. As a rule, poor black people do not work their way out of the ghetto\u2014and those who do often face the horror of watching their children and grandchildren tumble back.\n\nEven seeming evidence of progress withers under harsh light. In 2012, the Manhattan Institute cheerily noted that segregation had declined since the 1960s. And yet African Americans still remained\u2014by far\u2014the most segregated ethnic group in the country. With segregation, with the isolation of the injured and the robbed, comes the concentration of disadvantage. An unsegregated America might see poverty, and all its effects, spread across the country with no particular bias toward skin color. Instead, the concentration of poverty has been paired with a concentration of melanin. The resulting conflagration has been devastating. One thread of thinking in the African American community holds that these depressing numbers partially stem from cultural pathologies that can be altered through individual grit and exceptionally good behavior. (In 2011, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, responding to violence among young black males, put the blame on the family: \u201cToo many men making too many babies they don\u2019t want to take care of, and then we end up dealing with your children.\u201d Nutter turned to those presumably fatherless babies: \u201cPull your pants up and buy a belt, because no one wants to see your underwear or the crack of your butt.\u201d) The thread is as old as black politics itself. It is also wrong. The kind of trenchant racism to which black people have persistently been subjected can never be defeated by making its victims more respectable. The essence of American racism is disrespect. And in the wake of the grim numbers, we see the grim inheritance.\n\nThe Contract Buyers League\u2019s suit brought by Clyde Ross and his allies took direct aim at this inheritance. The suit was rooted in Chicago\u2019s long history of segregation, which had created two housing markets\u2014one legitimate and backed by the government, the other lawless and patrolled by predators. The suit dragged on until 1976, when the league lost a jury trial. Securing the equal protection of the law proved hard; securing reparations proved impossible. If there were any doubts about the mood of the jury, the foreman removed them by saying, when asked about the verdict, that he hoped it would help end \u201cthe mess Earl Warren made with Brown v. Board of Education and all that nonsense.\u201d An unsegregated America might see poverty spread across the country, with no particular bias toward skin color. The Supreme Court seems to share that sentiment. The past two decades have witnessed a rollback of the progressive legislation of the 1960s. Liberals have found themselves on the defensive. In 2008, when Barack Obama was a candidate for president, he was asked whether his daughters\u2014Malia and Sasha\u2014should benefit from affirmative action. He answered in the negative. The exchange rested upon an erroneous comparison of the average American white family and the exceptional first family. In the contest of upward mobility, Barack and Michelle Obama have won. But they\u2019ve won by being twice as good\u2014and enduring twice as much. Malia and Sasha Obama enjoy privileges beyond the average white child\u2019s dreams. But that comparison is incomplete. The more telling question is how they compare with Jenna and Barbara Bush\u2014the products of many generations of privilege, not just one. Whatever the Obama children achieve, it will be evidence of their family\u2019s singular perseverance, not of broad equality.\n\nIII. \u201cWe Inherit Our Ample Patrimony\u201d In 1783, the freedwoman Belinda Royall petitioned the commonwealth of Massachusetts for reparations. Belinda had been born in modern-day Ghana. She was kidnapped as a child and sold into slavery. She endured the Middle Passage and 50 years of enslavement at the hands of Isaac Royall and his son. But the junior Royall, a British loyalist, fled the country during the Revolution. Belinda, now free after half a century of labor, beseeched the nascent Massachusetts legislature: The face of your Petitioner, is now marked with the furrows of time, and her frame bending under the oppression of years, while she, by the Laws of the Land, is denied the employment of one morsel of that immense wealth, apart whereof hath been accumilated by her own industry, and the whole augmented by her servitude.\n\n\n\nWHEREFORE, casting herself at your feet if your honours, as to a body of men, formed for the extirpation of vassalage, for the reward of Virtue, and the just return of honest industry\u2014she prays, that such allowance may be made her out of the Estate of Colonel Royall, as will prevent her, and her more infirm daughter, from misery in the greatest extreme, and scatter comfort over the short and downward path of their lives. Belinda Royall was granted a pension of 15 pounds and 12 shillings, to be paid out of the estate of Isaac Royall\u2014one of the earliest successful attempts to petition for reparations. At the time, black people in America had endured more than 150 years of enslavement, and the idea that they might be owed something in return was, if not the national consensus, at least not outrageous. \u201cA heavy account lies against us as a civil society for oppressions committed against people who did not injure us,\u201d wrote the Quaker John Woolman in 1769, \u201cand that if the particular case of many individuals were fairly stated, it would appear that there was considerable due to them.\u201d\n\nAs the historian Roy E. Finkenbine has documented, at the dawn of this country, black reparations were actively considered and often effected. Quakers in New York, New England, and Baltimore went so far as to make \u201cmembership contingent upon compensating one\u2019s former slaves.\u201d In 1782, the Quaker Robert Pleasants emancipated his 78 slaves, granted them 350 acres, and later built a school on their property and provided for their education. \u201cThe doing of this justice to the injured Africans,\u201d wrote Pleasants, \u201cwould be an acceptable offering to him who \u2018Rules in the kingdom of men.\u2019 \u201d Edward Coles, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Thomas Jefferson who became a slaveholder through inheritance, took many of his slaves north and granted them a plot of land in Illinois. John Randolph, a cousin of Jefferson\u2019s, willed that all his slaves be emancipated upon his death, and that all those older than 40 be given 10 acres of land. \u201cI give and bequeath to all my slaves their freedom,\u201d Randolph wrote, \u201cheartily regretting that I have been the owner of one.\u201d In his book Forever Free, Eric Foner recounts the story of a disgruntled planter reprimanding a freedman loafing on the job: Planter: \u201cYou lazy nigger, I am losing a whole day\u2019s labor by you.\u201d\n\n\n\nFreedman: \u201cMassa, how many days\u2019 labor have I lost by you?\u201d In the 20th century, the cause of reparations was taken up by a diverse cast that included the Confederate veteran Walter R. Vaughan, who believed that reparations would be a stimulus for the South; the black activist Callie House; black-nationalist leaders like \u201cQueen Mother\u201d Audley Moore; and the civil-rights activist James Forman. The movement coalesced in 1987 under an umbrella organization called the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America (N\u2019COBRA). The NAACP endorsed reparations in 1993. Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a professor at Harvard Law School, has pursued reparations claims in court.\n\nBut while the people advocating reparations have changed over time, the response from the country has remained virtually the same. \u201cThey have been taught to labor,\u201d the Chicago Tribune editorialized in 1891. \u201cThey have been taught Christian civilization, and to speak the noble English language instead of some African gibberish. The account is square with the ex\u2011slaves.\u201d Not exactly. Having been enslaved for 250 years, black people were not left to their own devices. They were terrorized. In the Deep South, a second slavery ruled. In the North, legislatures, mayors, civic associations, banks, and citizens all colluded to pin black people into ghettos, where they were overcrowded, overcharged, and undereducated. Businesses discriminated against them, awarding them the worst jobs and the worst wages. Police brutalized them in the streets. And the notion that black lives, black bodies, and black wealth were rightful targets remained deeply rooted in the broader society. Now we have half-stepped away from our long centuries of despoilment, promising, \u201cNever again.\u201d But still we are haunted. It is as though we have run up a credit-card bill and, having pledged to charge no more, remain befuddled that the balance does not disappear. The effects of that balance, interest accruing daily, are all around us. Broach the topic of reparations today and a barrage of questions inevitably follows: Who will be paid? How much will they be paid? Who will pay? But if the practicalities, not the justice, of reparations are the true sticking point, there has for some time been the beginnings of a solution. For the past 25 years, Congressman John Conyers Jr., who represents the Detroit area, has marked every session of Congress by introducing a bill calling for a congressional study of slavery and its lingering effects as well as recommendations for \u201cappropriate remedies.\u201d\n\nA country curious about how reparations might actually work has an easy solution in Conyers\u2019s bill, now called HR 40, the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act. We would support this bill, submit the question to study, and then assess the possible solutions. But we are not interested. reporter\u2019s notebook\n\nWhat We Should Be Asking About Reparations\n\n\u201cAny contemplation of compensated emancipation must grapple with how several counties, and some states in the South, would react to finding themselves suddenly outnumbered by free black people.\u201d\n\nRead more \u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s black folks making the claim,\u201d Nkechi Taifa, who helped found N\u2019COBRA, says. \u201cPeople who talk about reparations are considered left lunatics. But all we are talking about is studying [reparations]. As John Conyers has said, we study everything. We study the water, the air. We can\u2019t even study the issue? This bill does not authorize one red cent to anyone.\u201d That HR 40 has never\u2014under either Democrats or Republicans\u2014made it to the House floor suggests our concerns are rooted not in the impracticality of reparations but in something more existential. If we conclude that the conditions in North Lawndale and black America are not inexplicable but are instead precisely what you\u2019d expect of a community that for centuries has lived in America\u2019s crosshairs, then what are we to make of the world\u2019s oldest democracy?\n\nOne cannot escape the question by hand-waving at the past, disavowing the acts of one\u2019s ancestors, nor by citing a recent date of ancestral immigration. The last slaveholder has been dead for a very long time. The last soldier to endure Valley Forge has been dead much longer. To proudly claim the veteran and disown the slaveholder is patriotism \u00e0 la carte. A nation outlives its generations. We were not there when Washington crossed the Delaware, but Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze\u2019s rendering has meaning to us. We were not there when Woodrow Wilson took us into World War I, but we are still paying out the pensions. If Thomas Jefferson\u2019s genius matters, then so does his taking of Sally Hemings\u2019s body. If George Washington crossing the Delaware matters, so must his ruthless pursuit of the runagate Oney Judge. Black families making $100,000 typically live in the kinds of neighborhoods inhabited by white families making $30,000. In 1909, President William Howard Taft told the country that \u201cintelligent\u201d white southerners were ready to see blacks as \u201cuseful members of the community.\u201d A week later Joseph Gordon, a black man, was lynched outside Greenwood, Mississippi. The high point of the lynching era has passed. But the memories of those robbed of their lives still live on in the lingering effects. Indeed, in America there is a strange and powerful belief that if you stab a black person 10 times, the bleeding stops and the healing begins the moment the assailant drops the knife. We believe white dominance to be a fact of the inert past, a delinquent debt that can be made to disappear if only we don\u2019t look.\n\nThere has always been another way. \u201cIt is in vain to alledge, that our ancestors brought them hither, and not we,\u201d Yale President Timothy Dwight said in 1810. We inherit our ample patrimony with all its incumbrances; and are bound to pay the debts of our ancestors. This debt, particularly, we are bound to discharge: and, when the righteous Judge of the Universe comes to reckon with his servants, he will rigidly exact the payment at our hands. To give them liberty, and stop here, is to entail upon them a curse. IV. \u201cThe Ills That Slavery Frees Us From\u201d America begins in black plunder and white democracy, two features that are not contradictory but complementary. \u201cThe men who came together to found the independent United States, dedicated to freedom and equality, either held slaves or were willing to join hands with those who did,\u201d the historian Edmund S. Morgan wrote. \u201cNone of them felt entirely comfortable about the fact, but neither did they feel responsible for it. Most of them had inherited both their slaves and their attachment to freedom from an earlier generation, and they knew the two were not unconnected.\u201d When enslaved Africans, plundered of their bodies, plundered of their families, and plundered of their labor, were brought to the colony of Virginia in 1619, they did not initially endure the naked racism that would engulf their progeny. Some of them were freed. Some of them intermarried. Still others escaped with the white indentured servants who had suffered as they had. Some even rebelled together, allying under Nathaniel Bacon to torch Jamestown in 1676.\n\nOne hundred years later, the idea of slaves and poor whites joining forces would shock the senses, but in the early days of the English colonies, the two groups had much in common. English visitors to Virginia found that its masters \u201cabuse their servantes with intollerable oppression and hard usage.\u201d White servants were flogged, tricked into serving beyond their contracts, and traded in much the same manner as slaves. This \u201chard usage\u201d originated in a simple fact of the New World\u2014land was boundless but cheap labor was limited. As life spans increased in the colony, the Virginia planters found in the enslaved Africans an even more efficient source of cheap labor. Whereas indentured servants were still legal subjects of the English crown and thus entitled to certain protections, African slaves entered the colonies as aliens. Exempted from the protections of the crown, they became early America\u2019s indispensable working class\u2014fit for maximum exploitation, capable of only minimal resistance. For the next 250 years, American law worked to reduce black people to a class of untouchables and raise all white men to the level of citizens. In 1650, Virginia mandated that \u201call persons except Negroes\u201d were to carry arms. In 1664, Maryland mandated that any Englishwoman who married a slave must live as a slave of her husband\u2019s master. In 1705, the Virginia assembly passed a law allowing for the dismemberment of unruly slaves\u2014but forbidding masters from whipping \u201ca Christian white servant naked, without an order from a justice of the peace.\u201d In that same law, the colony mandated that \u201call horses, cattle, and hogs, now belonging, or that hereafter shall belong to any slave\u201d be seized and sold off by the local church, the profits used to support \u201cthe poor of the said parish.\u201d At that time, there would have still been people alive who could remember blacks and whites joining to burn down Jamestown only 29 years before. But at the beginning of the 18th century, two primary classes were enshrined in America. \u201cThe two great divisions of society are not the rich and poor, but white and black,\u201d John C. Calhoun, South Carolina\u2019s senior senator, declared on the Senate floor in 1848. \u201cAnd all the former, the poor as well as the rich, belong to the upper class, and are respected and treated as equals.\u201d In 1860, the majority of people living in South Carolina and Mississippi, almost half of those living in Georgia, and about one-third of all Southerners were on the wrong side of Calhoun\u2019s line. The state with the largest number of enslaved Americans was Virginia, where in certain counties some 70 percent of all people labored in chains. Nearly one-fourth of all white Southerners owned slaves, and upon their backs the economic basis of America\u2014and much of the Atlantic world\u2014was erected. In the seven cotton states, one-third of all white income was derived from slavery. By 1840, cotton produced by slave labor constituted 59 percent of the country\u2019s exports. The web of this slave society extended north to the looms of New England, and across the Atlantic to Great Britain, where it powered a great economic transformation and altered the trajectory of world history. \u201cWhoever says Industrial Revolution,\u201d wrote the historian Eric J. Hobsbawm, \u201csays cotton.\u201d The wealth accorded America by slavery was not just in what the slaves pulled from the land but in the slaves themselves. \u201cIn 1860, slaves as an asset were worth more than all of America\u2019s manufacturing, all of the railroads, all of the productive capacity of the United States put together,\u201d the Yale historian David W. Blight has noted. \u201cSlaves were the single largest, by far, financial asset of property in the entire American economy.\u201d The sale of these slaves\u2014\u201cin whose bodies that money congealed,\u201d writes Walter Johnson, a Harvard historian\u2014generated even more ancillary wealth. Loans were taken out for purchase, to be repaid with interest. Insurance policies were drafted against the untimely death of a slave and the loss of potential profits. Slave sales were taxed and notarized. The vending of the black body and the sundering of the black family became an economy unto themselves, estimated to have brought in tens of millions of dollars to antebellum America. In 1860 there were more millionaires per capita in the Mississippi Valley than anywhere else in the country. Beneath the cold numbers lay lives divided. \u201cI had a constant dread that Mrs. Moore, her mistress, would be in want of money and sell my dear wife,\u201d a freedman wrote, reflecting on his time in slavery. \u201cWe constantly dreaded a final separation. Our affection for each was very strong, and this made us always apprehensive of a cruel parting.\u201d Forced partings were common in the antebellum South. A slave in some parts of the region stood a 30 percent chance of being sold in his or her lifetime. Twenty-five percent of interstate trades destroyed a first marriage and half of them destroyed a nuclear family. When the wife and children of Henry Brown, a slave in Richmond, Virginia, were to be sold away, Brown searched for a white master who might buy his wife and children to keep the family together. He failed: The next day, I stationed myself by the side of the road, along which the slaves, amounting to three hundred and fifty, were to pass. The purchaser of my wife was a Methodist minister, who was about starting for North Carolina. Pretty soon five waggon-loads of little children passed, and looking at the foremost one, what should I see but a little child, pointing its tiny hand towards me, exclaiming, \u201cThere\u2019s my father; I knew he would come and bid me good-bye.\u201d It was my eldest child! Soon the gang approached in which my wife was chained. I looked, and beheld her familiar face; but O, reader, that glance of agony! may God spare me ever again enduring the excruciating horror of that moment! She passed, and came near to where I stood. I seized hold of her hand, intending to bid her farewell; but words failed me; the gift of utterance had fled, and I remained speechless. I followed her for some distance, with her hand grasped in mine, as if to save her from her fate, but I could not speak, and I was obliged to turn away in silence. In a time when telecommunications were primitive and blacks lacked freedom of movement, the parting of black families was a kind of murder. Here we find the roots of American wealth and democracy\u2014in the for-profit destruction of the most important asset available to any people, the family. The destruction was not incidental to America\u2019s rise; it facilitated that rise. By erecting a slave society, America created the economic foundation for its great experiment in democracy. The labor strife that seeded Bacon\u2019s rebellion was suppressed. America\u2019s indispensable working class existed as property beyond the realm of politics, leaving white Americans free to trumpet their love of freedom and democratic values. Assessing antebellum democracy in Virginia, a visitor from England observed that the state\u2019s natives \u201ccan profess an unbounded love of liberty and of democracy in consequence of the mass of the people, who in other countries might become mobs, being there nearly altogether composed of their own Negro slaves.\u201d V. The Quiet Plunder The consequences of 250 years of enslavement, of war upon black families and black people, were profound. Like homeownership today, slave ownership was aspirational, attracting not just those who owned slaves but those who wished to. Much as homeowners today might discuss the addition of a patio or the painting of a living room, slaveholders traded tips on the best methods for breeding workers, exacting labor, and doling out punishment. Just as a homeowner today might subscribe to a magazine like This Old House, slaveholders had journals such as De Bow\u2019s Review, which recommended the best practices for wringing profits from slaves. By the dawn of the Civil War, the enslavement of black America was thought to be so foundational to the country that those who sought to end it were branded heretics worthy of death. Imagine what would happen if a president today came out in favor of taking all American homes from their owners: the reaction might well be violent. \u201cThis country was formed for the white, not for the black man,\u201d John Wilkes Booth wrote, before killing Abraham Lincoln. \u201cAnd looking upon African slavery from the same standpoint held by those noble framers of our Constitution, I for one have ever considered it one of the greatest blessings (both for themselves and us) that God ever bestowed upon a favored nation.\u201d In the aftermath of the Civil War, Radical Republicans attempted to reconstruct the country upon something resembling universal equality\u2014but they were beaten back by a campaign of \u201cRedemption,\u201d led by White Liners, Red Shirts, and Klansmen bent on upholding a society \u201cformed for the white, not for the black man.\u201d A wave of terrorism roiled the South. In his massive history Reconstruction, Eric Foner recounts incidents of black people being attacked for not removing their hats; for refusing to hand over a whiskey flask; for disobeying church procedures; for \u201cusing insolent language\u201d; for disputing labor contracts; for refusing to be \u201ctied like a slave.\u201d Sometimes the attacks were intended simply to \u201cthin out the niggers a little.\u201d Terrorism carried the day. Federal troops withdrew from the South in 1877. The dream of Reconstruction died. For the next century, political violence was visited upon blacks wantonly, with special treatment meted out toward black people of ambition. Black schools and churches were burned to the ground. Black voters and the political candidates who attempted to rally them were intimidated, and some were murdered. At the end of World War I, black veterans returning to their homes were assaulted for daring to wear the American uniform. The demobilization of soldiers after the war, which put white and black veterans into competition for scarce jobs, produced the Red Summer of 1919: a succession of racist pogroms against dozens of cities ranging from Longview, Texas, to Chicago to Washington, D.C. Organized white violence against blacks continued into the 1920s\u2014in 1921 a white mob leveled Tulsa\u2019s \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d and in 1923 another one razed the black town of Rosewood, Florida\u2014and virtually no one was punished.\n\nThe work of mobs was a rabid and violent rendition of prejudices that extended even into the upper reaches of American government. The New Deal is today remembered as a model for what progressive government should do\u2014cast a broad social safety net that protects the poor and the afflicted while building the middle class. When progressives wish to express their disappointment with Barack Obama, they point to the accomplishments of Franklin Roosevelt. But these progressives rarely note that Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, much like the democracy that produced it, rested on the foundation of Jim Crow. \u201cThe Jim Crow South,\u201d writes Ira Katznelson, a history and political-science professor at Columbia, \u201cwas the one collaborator America\u2019s democracy could not do without.\u201d The marks of that collaboration are all over the New Deal. The omnibus programs passed under the Social Security Act in 1935 were crafted in such a way as to protect the southern way of life. Old-age insurance (Social Security proper) and unemployment insurance excluded farmworkers and domestics\u2014jobs heavily occupied by blacks. When President Roosevelt signed Social Security into law in 1935, 65 percent of African Americans nationally and between 70 and 80 percent in the South were ineligible. The NAACP protested, calling the new American safety net \u201ca sieve with holes just big enough for the majority of Negroes to fall through.\u201d The oft-celebrated G.I. Bill similarly failed black Americans, by mirroring the broader country\u2019s insistence on a racist housing policy. Though ostensibly color-blind, Title III of the bill, which aimed to give veterans access to low-interest home loans, left black veterans to tangle with white officials at their local Veterans Administration as well as with the same banks that had, for years, refused to grant mortgages to blacks. The historian Kathleen J. Frydl observes in her 2009 book, The GI Bill, that so many blacks were disqualified from receiving Title III benefits \u201cthat it is more accurate simply to say that blacks could not use this particular title.\u201d In Cold War America, homeownership was seen as a means of instilling patriotism, and as a civilizing and anti-radical force. \u201cNo man who owns his own house and lot can be a Communist,\u201d claimed William Levitt, who pioneered the modern suburb with the development of the various Levittowns, his famous planned communities. \u201cHe has too much to do.\u201d But the Levittowns were, with Levitt\u2019s willing acquiescence, segregated throughout their early years. Daisy and Bill Myers, the first black family to move into Levittown, Pennsylvania, were greeted with protests and a burning cross. A neighbor who opposed the family said that Bill Myers was \u201cprobably a nice guy, but every time I look at him I see $2,000 drop off the value of my house.\u201d The neighbor had good reason to be afraid. Bill and Daisy Myers were from the other side of John C. Calhoun\u2019s dual society. If they moved next door, housing policy almost guaranteed that their neighbors\u2019 property values would decline. Whereas shortly before the New Deal, a typical mortgage required a large down payment and full repayment within about 10 years, the creation of the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation in 1933 and then the Federal Housing Administration the following year allowed banks to offer loans requiring no more than 10 percent down, amortized over 20 to 30 years. \u201cWithout federal intervention in the housing market, massive suburbanization would have been impossible,\u201d writes Thomas J. Sugrue, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIn 1930, only 30 percent of Americans owned their own homes; by 1960, more than 60 percent were home owners. Home ownership became an emblem of American citizenship.\u201d That emblem was not to be awarded to blacks. The American real-estate industry believed segregation to be a moral principle. As late as 1950, the National Association of Real Estate Boards\u2019 code of ethics warned that \u201ca Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood \u2026 any race or nationality, or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values.\u201d A 1943 brochure specified that such potential undesirables might include madams, bootleggers, gangsters\u2014and \u201ca colored man of means who was giving his children a college education and thought they were entitled to live among whites.\u201d The federal government concurred. It was the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation, not a private trade association, that pioneered the practice of redlining, selectively granting loans and insisting that any property it insured be covered by a restrictive covenant\u2014a clause in the deed forbidding the sale of the property to anyone other than whites. Millions of dollars flowed from tax coffers into segregated white neighborhoods. One man said his black neighbor was \u201cprobably a nice guy, but every time I look at him I see $2,000 drop off the value of my house.\u201d \u201cFor perhaps the first time, the federal government embraced the discriminatory attitudes of the marketplace,\u201d the historian Kenneth T. Jackson wrote in his 1985 book, Crabgrass Frontier, a history of suburbanization. \u201cPreviously, prejudices were personalized and individualized; FHA exhorted segregation and enshrined it as public policy. Whole areas of cities were declared ineligible for loan guarantees.\u201d Redlining was not officially outlawed until 1968, by the Fair Housing Act. By then the damage was done\u2014and reports of redlining by banks have continued. The federal government is premised on equal fealty from all its citizens, who in return are to receive equal treatment. But as late as the mid-20th century, this bargain was not granted to black people, who repeatedly paid a higher price for citizenship and received less in return. Plunder had been the essential feature of slavery, of the society described by Calhoun. But practically a full century after the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, the plunder\u2014quiet, systemic, submerged\u2014continued even amidst the aims and achievements of New Deal liberals. VI. Making The Second Ghetto Today Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in the country, a fact that reflects assiduous planning. In the effort to uphold white supremacy at every level down to the neighborhood, Chicago\u2014a city founded by the black fur trader Jean Baptiste Point du Sable\u2014has long been a pioneer. The efforts began in earnest in 1917, when the Chicago Real Estate Board, horrified by the influx of southern blacks, lobbied to zone the entire city by race. But after the Supreme Court ruled against explicit racial zoning that year, the city was forced to pursue its agenda by more-discreet means. Like the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation, the Federal Housing Administration initially insisted on restrictive covenants, which helped bar blacks and other ethnic undesirables from receiving federally backed home loans. By the 1940s, Chicago led the nation in the use of these restrictive covenants, and about half of all residential neighborhoods in the city were effectively off-limits to blacks. It is common today to become misty-eyed about the old black ghetto, where doctors and lawyers lived next door to meatpackers and steelworkers, who themselves lived next door to prostitutes and the unemployed. This segregationist nostalgia ignores the actual conditions endured by the people living there\u2014vermin and arson, for instance\u2014and ignores the fact that the old ghetto was premised on denying black people privileges enjoyed by white Americans. In 1948, when the Supreme Court ruled that restrictive covenants, while permissible, were not enforceable by judicial action, Chicago had other weapons at the ready. The Illinois state legislature had already given Chicago\u2019s city council the right to approve\u2014and thus to veto\u2014any public housing in the city\u2019s wards. This came in handy in 1949, when a new federal housing act sent millions of tax dollars into Chicago and other cities around the country. Beginning in 1950, site selection for public housing proceeded entirely on the grounds of segregation. By the 1960s, the city had created with its vast housing projects what the historian Arnold R. Hirsch calls a \u201csecond ghetto,\u201d one larger than the old Black Belt but just as impermeable. More than 98 percent of all the family public-housing units built in Chicago between 1950 and the mid\u20111960s were built in all-black neighborhoods. Governmental embrace of segregation was driven by the virulent racism of Chicago\u2019s white citizens. White neighborhoods vulnerable to black encroachment formed block associations for the sole purpose of enforcing segregation. They lobbied fellow whites not to sell. They lobbied those blacks who did manage to buy to sell back. In 1949, a group of Englewood Catholics formed block associations intended to \u201ckeep up the neighborhood.\u201d Translation: keep black people out. And when civic engagement was not enough, when government failed, when private banks could no longer hold the line, Chicago turned to an old tool in the American repertoire\u2014racial violence. \u201cThe pattern of terrorism is easily discernible,\u201d concluded a Chicago civic group in the 1940s. \u201cIt is at the seams of the black ghetto in all directions.\u201d On July 1 and 2 of 1946, a mob of thousands assembled in Chicago\u2019s Park Manor neighborhood, hoping to eject a black doctor who\u2019d recently moved in. The mob pelted the house with rocks and set the garage on fire. The doctor moved away. In 1947, after a few black veterans moved into the Fernwood section of Chicago, three nights of rioting broke out; gangs of whites yanked blacks off streetcars and beat them. Two years later, when a union meeting attended by blacks in Englewood triggered rumors that a home was being \u201csold to niggers,\u201d blacks (and whites thought to be sympathetic to them) were beaten in the streets. In 1951, thousands of whites in Cicero, 20 minutes or so west of downtown Chicago, attacked an apartment building that housed a single black family, throwing bricks and firebombs through the windows and setting the apartment on fire. A Cook County grand jury declined to charge the rioters\u2014and instead indicted the family\u2019s NAACP attorney, the apartment\u2019s white owner, and the owner\u2019s attorney and rental agent, charging them with conspiring to lower property values. Two years after that, whites picketed and planted explosives in South Deering, about 30 minutes from downtown Chicago, to force blacks out.\n\nWhen terrorism ultimately failed, white homeowners simply fled the neighborhood. The traditional terminology, white flight, implies a kind of natural expression of preference. In fact, white flight was a triumph of social engineering, orchestrated by the shared racist presumptions of America\u2019s public and private sectors. For should any nonracist white families decide that integration might not be so bad as a matter of principle or practicality, they still had to contend with the hard facts of American housing policy: When the mid-20th-century white homeowner claimed that the presence of a Bill and Daisy Myers decreased his property value, he was not merely engaging in racist dogma\u2014he was accurately observing the impact of federal policy on market prices. Redlining destroyed the possibility of investment wherever black people lived. VII. \u201cA Lot Of People Fell By The Way\u201d Speculators in North Lawndale, and at the edge of the black ghettos, knew there was money to be made off white panic. They resorted to \u201cblock-busting\u201d\u2014spooking whites into selling cheap before the neighborhood became black. They would hire a black woman to walk up and down the street with a stroller. Or they\u2019d hire someone to call a number in the neighborhood looking for \u201cJohnny Mae.\u201d Then they\u2019d cajole whites into selling at low prices, informing them that the more blacks who moved in, the more the value of their homes would decline, so better to sell now. With these white-fled homes in hand, speculators then turned to the masses of black people who had streamed northward as part of the Great Migration, or who were desperate to escape the ghettos: the speculators would take the houses they\u2019d just bought cheap through block-busting and sell them to blacks on contract. To keep up with his payments and keep his heat on, Clyde Ross took a second job at the post office and then a third job delivering pizza. His wife took a job working at Marshall Field. He had to take some of his children out of private school. He was not able to be at home to supervise his children or help them with their homework. Money and time that Ross wanted to give his children went instead to enrich white speculators. \u201cThe problem was the money,\u201d Ross told me. \u201cWithout the money, you can\u2019t move. You can\u2019t educate your kids. You can\u2019t give them the right kind of food. Can\u2019t make the house look good. They think this neighborhood is where they supposed to be. It changes their outlook. My kids were going to the best schools in this neighborhood, and I couldn\u2019t keep them in there.\u201d Mattie Lewis came to Chicago from her native Alabama in the mid-\u201940s, when she was 21, persuaded by a friend who told her she could get a job as a hairdresser. Instead she was hired by Western Electric, where she worked for 41 years. I met Lewis in the home of her neighbor Ethel Weatherspoon. Both had owned homes in North Lawndale for more than 50 years. Both had bought their houses on contract. Both had been active with Clyde Ross in the Contract Buyers League\u2019s effort to garner restitution from contract sellers who\u2019d operated in North Lawndale, banks who\u2019d backed the scheme, and even the Federal Housing Administration. We were joined by Jack Macnamara, who\u2019d been an organizing force in the Contract Buyers League when it was founded, in 1968.
