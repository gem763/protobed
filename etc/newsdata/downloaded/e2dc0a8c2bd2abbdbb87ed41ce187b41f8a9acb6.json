He only killed his own flesh and blood. The judge repeatedly said life means life.\"\n\nMs Playfair expressed concerns that 50-year-old Smith could find another woman and father another child if he is released from prison.\n\nShe also questioned why he was now deemed not a risk to the public, two years after the parole board decided to keep him inside a secure facility.\n\nDuring the murder trial, Smith tried to convince jurors that while he killed Lauren, the other babies died of cot death.\n\n(Image: THE SENTINEL)\n\nThe jury heard Smith took baby Lauren into a pub in Stone where he had two-and-a-half pints of beer on the first day he had looked after her on his own.\n\nThen, because Lauren was crying, Smith took her to Westbridge Park where he pushed her face into a car seat before taking her home and suffocating her with his hand over her face.\n\nThe trainee care home assistant was convicted on three counts of murder after expert witnesses suggested the children had all been suffocated.\n\nMs Playfair believes her daughter Lauren was born to bring about justice for Jamie and Eleisha - her death triggering an investigation into the other two babies'.\n\nEarlier this year the bereaved mum started a petition calling for Smith to be kept in a secure prison.\n\n(Image: THE SENTINEL)\n\nIt received more than 4,500 signatures.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice said public protection was its priority and offenders were returned to closed prison \"at the first sign of concern\".\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \"This will understandably be a very distressing decision for the victims' families and our thoughts remain with them.\n\n\"The independent Parole Board conducts a thorough risk assessment before recommending a transfer to open conditions.\"", "description": "The Parole Board has moved murderer Simon Smith to an open prison after he killed three babies in the Staffordshire town of Stone", "authors": ["James Rodger", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "The Sentinel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20643495.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_gojf3k45q5eg2dnwdhf0n555-1375521220.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
