Courtesy Lisa Reihana\n\nBut apart from her compelling cross\u2011cultural vision, key to Reihana\u2019s global success has been her commitment to travel and fostering relationships with far-flung curators and collectors on the ground. \u201cI adhere to a Maori philosophy that values kanohi ki te kanohi [\u201cface to face\u201d] or the known face,\u201d Reihana explains. \u201cRelationships are what makes my work stronger \u2013 a combination of knowledge and empathy.\u201d\n\nIn Sydney, that \u201cknown face\u201d is Dan\u2011Cuthbert. The pair met in 2002 when they were introduced through a mutual friend, and Dan-Cuthbert and her husband Chris acquired a work from Reihana\u2019s celebrated Digital Marae series. Not only does the imposing photographic portrait Mahuika from the series hold \u201cpride of place\u201d in their eastern suburbs home, but it has literally embedded Reihana\u2019s family into their lives.\n\n\u201cWhenever I visit, I feel at home,\u201d says Reihana, \u201cas there is my Aunty Rongo, who I cast as Mahuika, on the wall. And over the years I have become good friends with Sally\u2019s family. We have had a soft approach to this idea of \u2018the dealer\u2019, becoming friends first.\u201d\n\nIn their case, it has been a friendship forged in journeying and travel \u2013 the subject, as it happens, of Reihana\u2019s epic in Pursuit of Venus [infected], an animated history of European colonialism in the Pacific which premiered at the 2017 Venice Biennale.\n\nA still from Lisa Reihana\u2019s video installation \"in Pursuit of Venus [infected]\".\n\nDan-Cuthbert says that \u201ctravel allows me to see the creativity and what\u2019s happening all around the world firsthand and in confluence\u201d.\n\nFor Reihana: \u201cTravel feeds ideas. Family is always with me. I often work with and include family in my work \u2013 I never feel alone.\u201d", "description": "Sydney gallery owner Sally Dan-Cuthbert and star New Zealand artist Lisa Reihana share their favourite global art destinations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2853%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_651/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/06dc8f6a2a70c5768ea65d420bf7602f9c600efb", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
