Protesters Say It's 'Too Little, Too Late.'", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "This article originally appeared on VICE News.\n\nHong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam announced Wednesday that her government is formally withdrawing a controversial extradition bill, a major concession to the hundreds of thousands of protesters who have been flooding the streets of the city in recent months.\n\nBut protesters say the move is \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came in a pre-recorded video published after Lam met with leading political figures in Hong Kong, including the Executive Council and the Hong Kong deputies to the National People\u2019s Congress, at the Government House.\n\nLam addressed the demands made by the protesters, saying the government responses have been \u201cmade with full consideration of different constraints and circumstances.\u201d\n\nLam outlined four steps her government is planning to take to address protesters\u2019 concerns:\n\nAs well as withdrawing the extradition bill, she is setting up a commission to investigate society\u2019s ills, allow the public to directly air their grievances with her office, and support a police-led inquiry into the violence in recent weeks,\n\nBut, in a chilling message to protesters, Lam warned: \u201cIt is our foremost priority now is to end violence, to safeguard the rule of law and to restore order and safety in society. As such, the Government has to strictly enforce the law against all violent and illegal acts.\u201d\n\nSome now fear that Lam\u2019s concession to protesters will be used to take more drastic actions against the protesters.\n\n\u201cIf this does not put an end to the protests in Hong Kong, it will still make it easier for the authorities to use even more repressive methods to crackdown on the activist protesters,\u201d Steve Tsang, director of London\u2019s SOAS China Institute, told VICE News.\n\nREAD: Hong Kong police have started arresting pro-democracy protest leaders\n\nThe controversial bill that sparked the last 13 weeks of protests would have allowed the extradition of suspects on a case-by-case basis to mainland China, where human rights abuses are rife and death sentences common.\n\nLam suspended the bill in July, after the city had been rocked by four consecutive weeks of protests.\n\nWednesday\u2019s announcement follows three months of increasingly tense and violent protests that have become a wider challenge to hold fully democratic and open elections, amid growing concerns about the influence Beijing exerts over Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the move has pleased markets, with the Hang Seng Index shooting up over 1,000 points on the news, pro-democracy protesters and lawmakers have already denounced the move as \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarrie Lam's response comes after 7 lives sacrificed, more than 1,200 protestors arrested, in which many are mistreated in police station,\u201d Joshua Wong, who helped lead the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests, tweeted moments before the announcement was made.\n\nWong is one a number of activists who have been arrested or attacked in recent weeks as the Hong Kong government sought to quash the protests.\n\nREAD: Chinese Military vehicles just entered Hong Kong. Beijing says there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\n\nThe activist claimed in a series of tweets that Lam\u2019s \u201cnotorious track record\u201d means no one will believe what she says, and warned the watching world not to be tricked by this announcement into thinking anything had changed.\n\nAs well as demanding the withdrawal of the extradition bill, protesters want authorities to stop the prosecution of protesters, stop referring to the protesters as rioters, hold an independent inquiry into police misconduct, and allow free elections.\n\n\u201cJust formally withdrawing the bill is very little and very late and is not enough \u2014 but it's a start,\u201d Emily Lau, a pro-democracy lawmaker, told VICE News. \u201cApart from withdrawing the bill, Carrie Lam should respond to the demand for setting up an independent Commission of inquiry to look into the months of protests and unrest and police brutality.\u201d\n\nREAD: A shadowy website Is offering big money for Hong Kong protesters to snitch on each other\n\nLau added that the reaction of the markets \u201cshows the business community, many of whom are from Mainland China, are anxious for good news that will boost the sickly economy.\n\nUltimately, however, the protesters are seeking major political reform in Hong Kong, to allow them to elect a government \u201cby universal and equal suffrage,\u201d Lau said.\n\nCover: - In this Sept. 3, 2019, file photo, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam speaks during a press conference in Hong Kong.
