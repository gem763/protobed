a lodestar by which we will guide our country towards a cleaner and greener future\u201d were among 22 Bills unveiled.\n\nOther legislation includes a long-delayed shake-up of social care, tougher sentences for the most serious criminals and confirmation of two Mirror victories on banning imports from trophy hunting and on Helen\u2019s Law, which will mean killers who refuse to reveal where they hid victims will be denied parole.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nThe move comes after a campaign by Marie McCourt, mother of Helen McCourt who vanished in February 1988 aged 22.\n\nHer murderer was convicted but has refused to say where he hid her body.\n\nThe Queen said: \"New sentencing laws will see that the most serious offenders spend longer in custody to reflect better the severity of their crimes.\"\n\nA Sentencing Bill will change the automatic release point from halfway to two thirds for adult offenders serving sentences of four years or more for serious violence or sexual offences.\n\nAt the same time ministers are preparing to rush through a bill to ratify any Brexit deal Mr Johnson is able to agree this week in Brussels in time for Britain to leave on the EU on October 31.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn an introduction to Queen\u2019s Speech, the PM also promised \u201cone of the greatest eras of infrastructure investment in everything from rail to roads to gigabit broadband\u201d as he aimed to \u201cget the gears on our national gearbox working again\u201d after Brexit.\n\nBut the pomp and ceremony of the traditional State Opening, amid tight security and foul weather , triggered fury that Her Majesty was being exploited for political purposes as the Tories gear up for an expected election.\n\nMr Johnson has a majority of minus 43 and is extremely unlikely to win crunch votes on the Queen\u2019s Speech next week, potentially setting the stage for another ballot - and meaning the address is more of a political broadcast than setting the parliamentary agenda.\n\nJeremy Corbyn has branded the speech a \"party political broadcast from the steps of the throne\".\n\n(Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOn Sunday he told Sky News it was \"utterly ludicrous\" for the PM so be setting out his proposals when he is running a \"Government that is now in minus 40\" and which \"hasn't yet won a vote in Parliament\"\n\nThe Government will also bring back the Domestic Abuse Bill which fell as a result of Mr Johnson's unlawful suspension of Parliament last month.\n\nMinisters had already announced plans to protect holidaymakers from being stranded abroad if airlines go under, which was in the Queen's Speech.\n\nThe monarch also announced proposals for the \"revolutionary reform\" of Britain's railways.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nIt is believed this includes proposals to scrap the rail franchising system, the contracting out of services introduced when the rail system was privatised in the 1990s, and replacing it with a \u201cnew commercial model.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson is promising to deliver on a pledge by his predecessor Theresa May to ensure all tips are paid to waiting staff following an outcry that some major restaurant chains - such as Giraffe and Prezzo - were keeping as much as 10% of tips paid by card.\n\nThe Employment (Allocation of Tips) Bill will put a legal obligation on restaurateurs to \"pass on all trips, gratuities and services charges to workers without deductions\".\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLabour has dismissed the decision to hold the speech before the Government goes to the country as a \"cynical stunt\".\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: \"This Queen's Speech is farcical.\n\n\"It is just an uncosted wish list which the Government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.\"\n\nMeanwhile, ahead of the Queen's Speech Mr Johnson received a winter flu jab.", "description": "The State Opening of Parliament the monarch forced to repeat the PM's increasingly unlikely promise to take Britain out of the EU by October 31", "authors": ["Ben Glaze", "Mikey Smith", "Image", "Swns", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pool Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20576294.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_STATE_OPENING_15.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
