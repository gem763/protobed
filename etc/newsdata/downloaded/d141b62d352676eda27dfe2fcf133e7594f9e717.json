Yale says Bloom died at a New Haven, Connecticut, hospital.\n\nBloom wrote more than 20 books and prided himself on making scholarly topics accessible to the general reader. Although he frequently bemoaned the decline of literary standards, he was as well placed as a contemporary critic could hope to be. He appeared on bestseller lists with such works as \u201cThe Western Canon\u201d and \u201cThe Book of J,\u201d was a guest on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and other programs and was a National Book Award finalist and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters\n\nHis greatest legacy could well outlive his own name: the title of his breakthrough book, The Anxiety of Influence. Bloom argued that creativity was not a grateful bow to the past, but a Freudian wrestle in which artists denied and distorted their literary ancestors while producing work that revealed an unmistakable debt.\n\nHe was referring to poetry in his 1973 publication, but \u201canxiety of influence\u201d has come to mean how artists of any kind respond to their inspirations. Bloom\u2019s theory has been endlessly debated, parodied and challenged, including by Bloom.\n\nBloom openly acknowledged his own heroes, among them Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson and the 19th century critic Walter Pater. He honored no boundaries between the life of the mind and life itself and absorbed the printed word to the point of fashioning himself after a favorite literary character, Shakespeare\u2019s betrayed, but life-affirming Falstaff. Bloom\u2019s affinity began at age 12 and he more than lived up to his hero\u2019s oversized aura in person. For decades he ranged about the Yale campus, with untamed hair and an anguished, theatrical voice, given to soliloquies over the present\u2019s plight.\n\nThe youngest of five children, he was born in 1930 in New York\u2019s East Bronx to Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Russia, neither of whom ever learned to read English. Bloom\u2019s literary journey began with Yiddish poetry, but he soon discovered the works of Hart Crane, T S Eliot, William Blake and other poets. He would allege that as a young man he could absorb 1,000 pages at a time.\n\nHe graduated in 1951 from Cornell University, where he studied under the celebrated critic M H Abrams, and lived abroad as a Fulbright Scholar at Pembroke College, Cambridge. After earning his doctorate degree from Yale in 1955, he joined the school\u2019s English faculty. Bloom married Jeanne Gould in 1958 and had two sons.\n\nIn the \u201950s, he opposed the rigid classicism of Eliot. But over the following decades, Bloom condemned Afrocentrism, feminism, Marxism and other movements he placed in the \u201cschool of resentment\u201d. A proud elitist, he disliked the Harry Potter books and slam poetry and was angered by Stephen King\u2019s receiving an honorary National Book Award. He dismissed as \u201cpure political correctness\u201d the awarding of the Nobel Prize for literature to Doris Lessing, author of the feminist classic The Golden Notebook.\n\n\u201cI am your true Marxist critic,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cfollowing Groucho rather than Karl, and take as my motto Groucho\u2019s grand admonition, \u2018Whatever it is, I\u2019m against it.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn The Western Canon, published in 1994, Bloom named the 26 crucial writers in Western literature, from Dante to Samuel Beckett, and declared Philip Roth, Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo among the contemporary greats. Shakespeare reigned at the canon\u2019s center.\n\nMany, however, had their own harsh criticism of Bloom. He was mocked as out of touch and accused of recycling a small number of themes. \u201cBloom had an idea; now the idea has him,\u201d British critic Christopher Ricks once observed.\n\nBloom\u2019s praises were not reserved for white men. In The Book of J, released in 1990, Bloom stated that some parts of the Bible were written by a woman. (He often praised the God of the Old Testament as one of the greatest fictional characters). He also admired Virginia Woolf, Jane Austen, George Eliot and Emily Dickinson and the hundreds of critical editions he edited include works on Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou and Amy Tan. Bloom did write a novel, The Flight to Lucifer, but was no more effective than most critics attempting fiction and later disowned the book. In The Anatomy of Influence, a summation released in 2011, Bloom called himself an epicurean who acknowledged no higher power other than art, living for \u201cmoments raised in quality by aesthetic appreciation\u201d.\n\nHis resistance to popular culture was emphatic, but not absolute. He was fond of the rock group The Band and fascinated by the Rev Jimmy Swaggart and other televangelists. He even confessed to watching MTV, telling The Paris Review in 1990 that \u201cwhat is going on there, not just in the lyrics but in its whole ambience, is the real vision of what the country needs and desires. It\u2019s the image of reality that it sees, and it\u2019s quite weird and wonderful.\u201d", "description": "He prided himself on making scholarly topics accessible to readers and wrote the bestsellers The Western Canon and The Book of J", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0c565d307e8ab13a413185c7fc69f187aacd874/0_187_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=374e144f9adf2b6977539ec11efabe8b", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
