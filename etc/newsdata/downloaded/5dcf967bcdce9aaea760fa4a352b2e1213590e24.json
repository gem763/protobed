Elsewhere, they fired live rounds as warning shots, and chased after protesters, pinning some of them down. The Hong Kong Police Force said on Twitter that \u201crioters\u201d in one district had injured multiple officers and reporters with \u201ccorrosive fluid.\u201d It did not elaborate.\n\nThe demonstrations began in earnest when tens of thousands of people joined an early afternoon march on Hong Kong\u2019s main island from the Causeway Bay shopping district toward the heart of the city\u2019s financial district. Some protesters sprinkled fake money \u2014 a traditional Chinese funerary custom \u2014 as a way of \u201cmourning\u201d China\u2019s National Day. Others cursed and taunted those riot police who were stationed nearby, and who retreated into the shadows of a nearby footbridge.\n\nThe Hong Kong island march was largely peaceful. But others across the territory turned into violent clashes.\n\nHundreds of protesters fought with riot police officers outside a shuttered town hall in Tuen Mun, close to Hong Kong\u2019s border with the Chinese mainland. The police also fired multiple rounds of tear gas at demonstrators in the Sha Tin, Tsuen Wan and Wong Tai Sin neighborhoods. And as protesters squared off with police at either side of an avenue in the working-class neighborhood of Sham Shui Po, some built makeshift roadblocks with trash cans and bamboo sticks, and others built bonfires.\n\nIn the Jordan neighborhood on the Kowloon Peninsula, seven masked men used a Molotov cocktail to burn posters of Xi Jinping outside a Chinese Army barracks. They left after setting the blaze, and soldiers inside the gates did not emerge to confront them.\n\nIn Wong Tai Sin, where the police had fired tear gas at one point near a retirement home, dozens of residents without masks or protest gear shouted at police to retreat.\n\n\u201cI want to cry. I come downstairs and feel that I have walked into a war zone,\u201d Vincey Wu, a 53-year-old accountant said. \u201cCarrie Lam has gone off to celebrate National Day. But has she thought about her people who are breathing in tear gas?\u201d", "description": "Clashes reach their most intense point in four months of protests as the police use a live round against a protester for the first time,  on a day Beijing celebrated 70 years of Communist Party rule.", "authors": ["The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/world/01china-live-new1/merlin_161894097_4bebeb04-0e51-41c5-9e14-19f7f49f4da3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
