USA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Social media influencer Sarah Tripp and her husband, Robbie Tripp, moved to San Francisco in 2016 brimming with optimism.\n\n\u201cWe thought, here\u2019s a city full of opportunities and connections where you go to work hard and succeed,\u201d says Tripp, 27, founder of the lifestyle blog Sassy Red Lipstick.\n\nBut after a year-long hunt for suitable housing in San Francisco only turned up \u201cplaces for $1 million that looked like rundown shacks and needed a remodel,\u201d the couple packed up and moved to Phoenix.\n\nThey went from paying San Francisco rents of $2,500 for a one-bedroom, one-bath apartment that was far from shopping and other amenities, to purchasing a newly constructed 3,000-square-foot, four-bedroom, four-bathroom home where they\u2019ll raise their newly arrived baby boy.\n\n\u201cIt was cool to be living near all those high-tech start-ups,\u201d Tripp says of her Bay Area years. \u201cBut you quickly saw that if you weren\u2019t part of that, you\u2019d be pushed out. It\u2019s just sad.\u201d\n\nFashion blogger Sarah Tripp and her husband, Robbie Tripp, lived in San Francisco for two years before deciding their money would go a lot farther somewhere else.

But increasingly only those who have struck it rich can afford to stay.\n\nOnce a bohemian mecca that welcomed the Beat Poets and '60s hippies, San Francisco now lays claim to the most expensive housing in the West, with a median home price of $1.4 million. There's also $5-a-gallon gas, private schools priced like universities and chic restaurants that cost nearly double the national average.\n\nEarlier this year, the San Francisco Bay Area was second only to New York \u2014 and ahead of Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Chicago \u2014 when it came to people leaving major U.S. cities. More than 28,190 departed in the second quarter of 2019, almost double 2017's rate, according to real estate brokerage Redfin.\n\nThe most popular in-state option for San Franciscans fleeing high costs is Sacramento, where the median home price is $350,000. Out of state, Seattle, at a $580,000 median, offers the biggest draw, Redfin data shows.\n\nYet another popular destination is even farther afield: Austin, a capital city with no state taxes and a booming tech scene that is home to Apple's latest HQ. The most recent quarter ending July 30 saw Austin receive 5,403 newcomers, the majority of which came from San Francisco, Redfin says.\n\nCalifornia overall also is losing residents. In 2018, 38,000 more people left the Golden State than entered, the second year in a row for this negative trend, according to the U.S. Census. A recent Edelman Trust Barometer survey found 53% of residents and 63% of millennials were considering leaving because of the high cost of living.\n\n\u201cThe great tragedy is this place was a middle-class paradise, and now you\u2019ve got the flight of the middle class with all their aspirations, leaving the poor, the rich and a transient population,\u201d says Joel Kotkin, presidential fellow in Urban Futures at Chapman University in Orange, California.\n\nIn the Bay Area, median household income is around $100,000, a tidy sum in most cities. But after federal and state taxes, residents have to cover rents that range from $3,600 a month in San Francisco to $4,600 in Silicon Valley, according to rental site Rent Cafe. That economic reality has left many of the city's low-income residents living in their cars or on the streets.\n\n\"I don't recognize my city, to be honest,\" says Shannon Way, executive director of HomeownershipSF, a non-profit umbrella group that helps residents secure housing. \"When you only have people at the extremes, it tears at the very fiber of what it means to live in a community.\"\n\nA street cleaner in San Francisco power washes the sidewalk in this 2016 file photo. The city's homelessness issue, driven in part by a lack of affordable housing, has become a major problem for lawmakers and residents alike, prompting some to flee the tech hub. (Photo: Eric Risberg, AP)\n\nWay says her organization does what it can to steer locals toward the city's few below market rate housing options, as well as a city down payment assistance loan program. \"We focus on those who really want to stay,\" she says. \"But it's getting harder and harder to survive here.\"\n\nThat desire to leave also hits the wealthiest of San Francisco residents, some of whom are perched in Pacific Heights mansions that fetch as much as $39 million.\n\nOver the past year, a wave of initial public offerings have involved San Francisco-based tech companies such as Lyft and Airbnb (and, coming soon, Uber). Some of those newly minted millionaires aren't keen to lose \"a lot of their windfalls to state taxes, so they start looking elsewhere,\u201d says Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. Typical tax-free landing spots include Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Incline Village, Nevada.\n\nCalifornia's biggest challenge\n\nBusiness and political leaders \u2014 from Salesforce billionaire Marc Benioff to Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 have sounded the alarm over the growing housing crisis.\n\nLast year, Benioff lobbied to pass a controversial San Francisco corporate tax to fund homelessness initiatives. And Newsom, who in his State of the State address early this year called housing \u201cour most overwhelming challenge,\u201d has committed $1.75 billion to fund new building projects.\n\nDuring a statewide tour in October, Newsom signed various housing bills, including one that puts an annual cap on rent increases at 5% plus inflation, and another that aims to block predatory evictions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in the wealthiest as well as the poorest state in America,\u201d Newsom said as he signed the bills at a ceremony in Oakland. \u201cCost of living. It is the issue that defines more issues than any other issue in this state.\"\n\nJim and Halie Casey, shown here with their 2-year-old daughter near their home in Austin, Texas, originally hail from San Jose, California. But more affordable housing and a better work-life balance prompted Halie Casey to transfer with Apple to the tech company's new Austin campus. (Photo: Courtesy of Halie Casey)\n\nSan Jose natives Halie and Jim Casey assumed that by getting into the housing market they could keep costs under control. They had purchased a small house well suited to the two of them and were happy. But then Halie got pregnant.\n\n\u201cWe quickly saw we couldn\u2019t afford anything bigger,\u201d she says.\n\nTheir appreciating asset served as a ticket out. The couple had purchased their home for $700,000, and two years later it was worth $1,000,000, thanks in part to Google buying up land in San Jose.\n\nJim, 40, decided to become a stay at home dad for a spell, while Halie, 32, arranged to transfer in May 2018 with her employer, Apple, to the company\u2019s new Austin offices.\n\n\u201cWe got a great house with a nice yard, have great schools, and all for less money which allowed us to pay off our debts,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s also a flexible, family-friendly nature to life here that doesn\u2019t exist in the intense, pressurized world of Bay Area tech.\u201d\n\nHousing threatens booming economy\n\nFor some experts, families opting to leave the state foreshadows larger problems. They worry a lack of affordable housing could jeopardize a state growth rate \u2014 one fueled in large part by Bay Area tech giants \u2014 that typically outpaces the national average. That could mean fewer jobs for those who stay.\n\n\u201cThe Bay Area\u2019s strength is also its greatest weakness,\u201d says Jordan Levine, deputy chief economist of the California Association of Realtors. \u201cThe area has a strong economy and some of the most innovative companies in the nation, but it\u2019s also a poster child for housing supply issues that haven\u2019t kept up with growth.\u201d\n\nIn this 2016 photo, tourists take souvenir photos of San Francisco and its iconic Golden Gate Bridge.

MABANGLO, EPA)\n\nChapman University's Kotkin says he\u2019s alarmed by the growing number of California companies moving to states where cheap housing and sometimes no state taxes make it easier to pay middle-managers a living wage. These include automakers (Mitsubishi leaving L.A. for Tennessee), defense contractors (Parsons leaving Pasadena for Washington, D.C.), and technology enterprises (Apple building in Austin).\n\n\u201cIn the end, you want a middle class in your state,\u201d says Kotkin. \u201cBecause a society without one is unstable.\u201d\n\nSolutions will have to come from public officials and citizens alike, says Dowell Myers, professor of policy, planning and demography at the University of Southern California\u2019s Sol Price School of Public Policy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not despondent, but it requires many people to see how their interests are negatively impacted,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you own a house, you benefit as your value goes up in a housing shortage. But your children and grandchildren will be impacted, they may not be able to live and work here. So that\u2019ll be the way things will change.\u201d\n\nThe alternative is bleak, says state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco).\n\n\"We're headed to a future where the middle class won't be able to raise families here, where restaurants increasingly will close because they can't hire workers, where teachers and police officers can't live anywhere near where they work,\" he says. \"We need a much greater sense of urgency.\"\n\nA woman walks through a homeless encampment where presidential candidate and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro visited in Oakland, California, on Sept. 25, 2019. (Photo: John G. Mabanglo, EPA-EFE)\n\nWiener, who has been criticized by housing activists who claim his various housing bills haven't been accommodating enough to low-income residents, says \"it's easy to just blame someone else when we need to look in the mirror.\"\n\nHe notes that tech companies such as Facebook and Google have put forth plans to build housing near their headquarters, only to be stopped by local zoning laws.\n\n\"Tech companies didn't cause our housing problems or create bad housing laws,\" says Wiener. \"This whole thing won't be easy politically or financially, and it won't happen fast.\"\n\nWest Seattle = New California\n\nBut time is of the essence. Many young, educated, upwardly mobile workers in San Francisco say they can't afford to wait around for government officials and business leader to come up with solutions.\n\nDeborah Neisuler, 42, never really thought she would leave her beloved Francisco.\n\nIn 2006, she and her husband Justin, 44 \u2014 he\u2019s in banking, she\u2019s a curriculum developer \u2014 bought a small house south of town that had easy access to local freeways leading to Silicon Valley.\n\nAs the years passed, two children arrived, and suddenly the house started to feel cramped. What\u2019s more, the prospect of private school tuition loomed given the city\u2019s lottery system doesn't guarantee a first-choice public school.\n\nThat\u2019s when a real estate agent friend offered to quietly test the waters for a sale, given their house had gone up in value 66%. Although \u201cno one had heard of our neighborhood when we bought there, it was close to the freeway and offered a good commute to Silicon Valley,\u201d says Deborah Neisuler.\n\nDeborah Neisuler, shown here with her husband, Justin, and their two children, recently moved to West Seattle, which locals call New California. (Photo: Courtesy of Deborah Neisuler)\n\nThe house sold quickly. Since both worked largely from home, their options were wide open. The couple didn\u2019t want to move back East, where they are both from, and Bay Area suburbs did not appeal. \"We are city people,\" she says.\n\nInstead, lured by a body of water and a sense of community, the family chose West Seattle. The area has become so popular with newcomers from down south \u201cpeople call it New California, because it seems people from there are taking over,\u201d Neisuler says with a laugh. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Yup, that\u2019s us.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough over the past few years she has longed for San Francisco\u2019s hip urban culture and sometimes struggles with Seattle\u2019s dark winters, Neisuler is thrilled with the change.\n\n\u201cI do really miss San Francisco, it holds a special place in my heart and we were there 13 years,\u201d says Neisuler. \u201cBut I know it\u2019s not the best place for my family.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellcava\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/19/california-housing-crisis-residents-flee-san-francisco-because-costs/3985196002/", "description": "A former bohemian mecca, San Francisco now\u00a0lays claim to the most expensive housing in the West, with\u00a0a median home price of $1.4 million.", "authors": ["Marco Della Cava", "Published A.M.
