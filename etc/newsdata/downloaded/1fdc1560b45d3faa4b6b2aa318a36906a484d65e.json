I don't think that we have this big problem like, for example, England do.\n\nBalakov has been preparing his players for Monday's Euro 2020 qualifying clash in Sofia\n\nEngland are wary of their black players being targeted, as they were during a visit in 2011\n\n'I would like to focus on football because at the end of the day we're all civilized Europeans and we're all working for this sport and that's all the matters.'\n\nAsked to clarify his remark on England, Balakov said: 'What I meant was that in the Bulgarian championship we've not had such problems.\n\n'While there have been incidents in various levels of English football involving racism, which I consider something normal because it's a big country with a very diverse population.\n\n'But we don't have this problem in Bulgaria, I can assure you of that.'\n\nSouthgate has repeatedly said that England need to get their own house in order and recently referenced the racist abuse at the National League clash between Hartlepool and Dover.\n\nPushed on whether England players have anything to be worried about, Balakov said: 'Once again, it's not an issue that has happened recently in the national team games, meaning racist chants or whatever.\n\n'I would once again advise people to think and talk about football because this is the reason why we're actually here. And we should not discuss something that has not even happened yet.'", "description": "Bulgaria manager Krasimir Balakov believes English football has a bigger problem with racism than they do.
