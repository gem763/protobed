The status would allow them to temporarily relocate to the U.S. to live and work while recovery efforts continue back at home.\n\nBut President Donald Trump appeared to close the door on that possibility just hours later when he claimed without evidence that \u201cvery bad people\u201d including gang members and drug dealers could be hidden among the survivors fleeing the islands.\n\n\u201cWe have to be very careful,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone needs totally proper documentation because the Bahamas had some tremendous problems with people going to the Bahamas who weren\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d\n\nThat same day, the Department of Homeland Security affirmed on its website that Bahamians traveling to the U.S. by sea \u201cmust be in possession of a valid passport AND valid travel visa.\u201d Those arriving without a visa by air may gain entry to the country by meeting certain other requirements, such as having a valid passport, a police certificate and no criminal record.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, reports emerged from CNN, NBC and eventually other outlets, announcing that the Trump administration would not consider TPS.\n\nDorian struck the Bahamas earlier this month as a Category 5 storm, leveling whole towns with winds howling up to 185 miles per hour. On Saturday, communities were bracing for the potential arrival of Tropical Storm Humberto, which was expected to bring heavy rains, but the system\u2019s track suddenly changed, and it remained out in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nNow, cleanup efforts are back underway. The official death toll from Dorian remains at 50, though there are still 1,300 people missing, according to The Associated Press. However, the numbers are preliminary.", "description": "Ken Cuccinelli is defending the administration\u2019s refusal to grant Bahamians temporary protected status after Hurricane Dorian devastated the islands.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7e65593b0000c49fd411f4.jpeg?cache=w82zl2tomr&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
