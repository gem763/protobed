BTC could accelerate decline if it continues to struggle near $8,400.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nYesterday, we discussed the chances of a possible rebound in bitcoin if it breaks the $8,400 resistance against the US Dollar. However, BTC price struggled to climb above the $8,400 resistance area. As a result, there was a fresh decline below the $8,300 level. Moreover, there was a break below the key $8,200 support area and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nFinally, the price traded below the $8,100 level and formed a new weekly low near $8,062. It is currently consolidating losses above the $8,100 level. Besides, it traded above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,386 high to $8,062 low. An immediate resistance is near the $8,200 level (the recent key support). The next resistance is near the $8,220 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,386 high to $8,062 low.\n\nHowever, the main resistance for bitcoin is near the $8,300 level and the 100 hourly SMA. Furthermore, there is a key declining channel forming with resistance near $8,350 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, a successful break above the channel resistance and a follow through above $8,400 is must for a decent recovery in the near term.\n\nOn the downside, there are not many supports up to $8,000. If the bears gain strength, they may perhaps succeed in clearing the $8,000 support area. The next major support is near the $7,800 level, below which the price is likely to head towards the $7,500 zone.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin is clearing struggling to recover above the $8,400 level. If the bulls continue to struggle, there is a risk of a bearish reaction below the $8,050 and $8,000 levels. In the mentioned case, the price could even struggle to stay above the $7,800 support area.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is struggling to gain strength in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is now well below the 40 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $8,000 followed by $7,800.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $8,350, $8,400 and $8,500.", "description": "Bitcoin price is showing signs of additional weakness below $8,200 against the US Dollar.
