Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) on Tuesday filed legislation calling on the House Judiciary Committee to begin an impeachment inquiry into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. According to the Congresswoman, she made the move as a means of \"supporting survivors.\"\n\n.@AyannaPressley plans to introduce a resolution tomorrow calling for the House Judiciary Committee to launch an \"impeachment inquiry\" of Brett Kavanaugh following the NYT's reporting over the weekend pic.twitter.com/VqKycrIFMu \u2014 Nik DeCosta-Klipa (@NikDeCostaKlipa) September 16, 2019\n\nPressley said she believes Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, which is why she filed the resolution.\n\n\"I believe Christine Blasey Ford. I believe Deborah Ramirez. It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors,\" the Congresswoman said in a statement. \"Sexual predators do not deserve a seat on the nation\u2019s highest court and Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process set a dangerous precedent. We must demand justice for survivors and hold Kavanaugh accountable for his actions.\"\n\nDuring an interview with CNN, Pressley referenced a new study that says one in 16 women's first sexual experience is rape as a link to the Kavanaugh case.\n\n\"One of the reasons I ran for Congress is to fight for the healing and the justice of all survivors. One in 16 women \u2013 of course we know this is not a genderized crime \u2013 and sexual assault is a crime, but a crime disproportionally perpetuated onto women,\" Pressley said. \"And one in 16 women's first sexual experience was rape. This is a public health crisis, an epidemic. I see it also as a social justice issue and it's deeply concerning that someone on the highest court in the land can have this many allegations.\"", "description": "Of course..09/18/2019 1:04:28AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/279/7198e684-b592-47f3-86d3-c8b6fe5f2361.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
