Others said that they were wary of hurting his feelings. One business associate told me that Biden, during difficult conversations about his family, \u201cgot deeply melancholy, which, to me, is more painful than if someone yelled and screamed at me. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve hurt him terribly. That was always my fear, that I would be really touching a very fragile part of him.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden admitted in an ABC News interview that aired Tuesday that he had likely gotten the position on the board because his father was the vice president of the United States.\n\n\u201cIf your last name wasn\u2019t Biden, do you think you would\u2019ve been asked to be on the board of Burisma?\u201d ABC News reporter Amy Robach asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Probably not, in retrospect,\u201d Hunter Biden replied.", "description": "President Donald Trump highlighted the news that a State Department official criticized Hunter Biden's board position in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Trump-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
