But critics have argued from the start that the mechanism is flawed.\n\nEven so around 5,000 companies are now signed up to use Privacy Shield to certify transfers of personal data. So there would be major disruption to businesses were it to go the way of its predecessor \u2014 as has looked likely in recent years, since Donald Trump took office as US president.\n\nThe Commission remains a staunch defender of Privacy Shield, warts and all, preferring to support data-sharing business as usual than offer a pro-active defence of EU citizens\u2019 privacy rights.\n\nTo date it has offered little in the way of objection about how the US has implemented Privacy Shield in these annual reviews, despite some glaring flaws and failures (for example the disgraced political data firm, Cambridge Analytica, was a signatory of the framework, even after the data misuse scandal blew up).\n\nThe Commission did lay down one deadline late last year, regarding the ongoing lack of a permanent ombudsperson. So it can now check that box.\n\nIt also notes approvingly today that the final two vacancies on the US\u2019 Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board have been filled, meaning it\u2019s fully-staffed for the first time since 2016.\n\nCommenting in a statement, commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, added: \u201cWith around 5,000 participating companies, the Privacy Shield has become a success story. The annual review is an important health check for its functioning. We will continue the digital diplomacy dialogue with our U.S. counterparts to make the Shield stronger, including when it comes to oversight, enforcement and, in a longer-term, to increase convergence of our systems.\u201d\n\nIts press release characterizes US enforcement action related to the Privacy Shield as having \u201cimproved\u201d \u2014 citing the Federal Trade Commission taking enforcement action in a grand total of seven cases.\n\nIt also says vaguely that \u201can increasing number\u201d of EU individuals are making use of their rights under the Privacy Shield, claiming the relevant redress mechanisms are \u201cfunctioning well\u201d. (Critics have long suggested the opposite.)\n\nThe Commission is recommending further improvements too though, including that the US expand compliance checks such as concerning false claims of participation in the framework.\n\nSo presumably there\u2019s a bunch of entirely fake compliance claims going unchecked, as well as actual compliance going under-checked\u2026\n\n\u201cThe Commission also expects the Federal Trade Commission to further step up its investigations into compliance with substantive requirements of the Privacy Shield and provide the Commission and the EU data protection authorities with information on ongoing investigations,\u201d the EC adds.\n\nAll these annual Commission reviews are just fiddling around the edges, though. The real substantive test for Privacy Shield which will determine its long term survival is looming on the horizon \u2014 from a judgement expected from Europe\u2019s top court next year.\n\nIn July a hearing took place on a key case that\u2019s been dubbed Schrems II. This is a legal challenge which initially targeted Facebook\u2019s use of another EU data transfer mechanism but has been broadened to include a series of legal questions over Privacy Shield \u2014 now with the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nThere is also a separate litigation directly targeting Privacy Shield that was brought by a French digital rights group which argues it\u2019s incompatible with EU law on account of US government mass surveillance practices.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s PR notes the pending litigation \u2014 writing that this \u201cmay also have an impact on the Privacy Shield\u201d. \u201cA hearing took place in July 2019 in case C-311/18 (Schrems II) and, once the Court\u2019s judgement is issued, the Commission will assess its consequences for the Privacy Shield,\u201d it adds.\n\nSo, tl;dr, today\u2019s third annual review doesn\u2019t mean Privacy Shield is out of the legal woods.", "description": "The third annual review of the EU-US Privacy Shield data transfer mechanism has once again been nodded through by Europe\u2019s executive.
