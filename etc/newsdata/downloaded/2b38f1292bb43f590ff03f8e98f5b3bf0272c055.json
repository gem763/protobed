Investors can purchase shares before the 10th of October in order to be eligible for this dividend, which will be paid on the 24th of October.\n\nTelenor's next dividend payment will be kr4.0 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of kr8.4 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Telenor stock has a trailing yield of around 4.6% on the current share price of NOK181.4. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Telenor\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Telenor distributed an unsustainably high 124% of its profit as dividends to shareholders last year. Without more sustainable payment behaviour, the dividend looks precarious. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 102% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want look more closely here.\n\nAs Telenor's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nOB:TEL Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Telenor earnings per share are up 3.8% per annum over the last five years. Minimal earnings growth, combined with concerningly high payout ratios suggests that Telenor is unlikely to grow the dividend much in future, and indeed the payment could be vulnerable to a cut.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, nine years ago, Telenor has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIs Telenor worth buying for its dividend? The dividends are not well covered by either income or free cash flow, although at least earnings per share are slowly increasing. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.\n\nCurious what other investors think of Telenor?
