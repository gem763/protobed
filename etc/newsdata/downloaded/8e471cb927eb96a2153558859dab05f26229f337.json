A lot of people applying for green cards are already here on \u201cnon-immigrant\u201d visas and aren\u2019t affected by the policy. Two-thirds of those applying from abroad \u2014 375,000 \u2014 is actually just about one-third of the million-plus green cards we give out each year. (This was lost on Vox.)\n\nSecond, the estimate comes from the fact that about a third of people who recently got green cards are uninsured, while another third get taxpayer-subsidized insurance that doesn\u2019t qualify under the policy. In other words, it assumes that no one will get insurance or switch plans to comply, which is absurd.\n\nHow easy it is to comply will depend on a lot of things we don\u2019t know, however, including how the administration decides to implement the rather vague proclamation, how quickly insurers act to provide cheap plans designed to meet the requirements at minimal cost, and how quickly blue states move to allow immigrants to buy cheap plans those states have limited or banned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThird, some of the people kept out by this policy could simply be replaced by others. In categories with numerical limits there are often huge backlogs, so as MPI notes, it \u201cremains to be seen by how much the proclamation would cut overall immigration versus shifting the composition of arriving immigrants.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put it bluntly, we have no idea how much legal immigration will fall when the policy goes into effect next month, but it won\u2019t be two-thirds, and it probably won\u2019t be very close to one-third either.\n\nLast, a word on the politics here: Something like this could have been an aggressive bargaining chip a few years ago, a way to pressure liberals in Congress to address the issue of immigration in a way Trump found acceptable. Right now, though, I imagine Democrats\u2019 response will be to tie it up in court for as long as possible and hope to win the presidency so they can reverse it.", "description": "We really don't know how much legal immigration will fall when the policy goes into effect next month, but it won't be two-thirds.", "authors": ["Robert Verbruggen", "Kevin D.
