But the road, sidewalk and front steps were drenched in red water that was colored with food dye, photos and video taken during and after the action show.\n\nNevertheless, the activists stood firm on the top deck of the firetruck as authorities arrived to arrest them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPhotos from the protest showed demonstrators being led away by police officers. A Met Police spokesman told BBC News that three men and one woman were arrested for alleged criminal damage.\n\nHanging from the vehicle was a sign that read, \u201cSTOP FUNDING CLIMATE DEATH.\u201d\n\nGreta Thunberg had one question at the U.N. climate summit: \u2018How dare you?\u2019\n\nThe protest-gone-awry was a precursor to a coordinated, global effort that kicks off Oct. 7 called International Rebellion, in which activists in 60 countries plan to pressure their governments to act on climate change.\n\nIt is organized by Extinction Rebellion, which calls on citizens to use peaceful civil disobedience to hold their governments accountable. The group is calling for a net-zero reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and the creation of a Citizens\u2019 Assembly on \u201cclimate and ecological diversity.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTalking to British radio station LBC on Thursday morning, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the climate change activist group involved in the fire-hose fiasco was responsible for putting additional pressure on a police service that is already \u201cunder-resourced and overstretched.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile Khan noted that \u201cbolder action\u201d on climate change is necessary, he condemned the protest as disruptive and accused the group of diverting police attention from other issues affecting the city.\n\nOn social media, the group\u2019s gaffe swiftly began trending in the United Kingdom, with opinion seemingly split over the messy protest. While some Britons found the group\u2019s action entertaining, others rebuked the protest.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat a complete disgrace these people are,\u201d tweeted Conservative Party lawmaker Susan Hall. \u201cI hope they are made to pay for the removal of this paint and the waste of Police and Fire Officers time. If they think this helps their cause they can think again!\u201d\n\nAnother Conservative member of Parliament, James Cleverly, tweeted: \u201cPeople doing stupid things like this, totally undermine the debate put forward by people who genuinely want to address climate change.\u201d\n\nJennifer Hassan reported from London.\n\nRead more:\n\nA Fox News guest called Greta Thunberg \u2018mentally ill.\u2019 The network apologized for the \u2018disgraceful\u2019 comment.\n\nOne of America\u2019s top climate scientists is an evangelical Christian. She\u2019s on a mission to persuade skeptics.\n\nHow should we talk about what\u2019s happening to our planet?\n\nAD", "description": "Fake blood was supposed to cover the British Treasury building.
