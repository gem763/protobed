One Fox News guest called her \u201ca mentally ill Swedish child,\u201d prompting the network to apologize to Thunberg and denounce the remark as \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\nFox News host Laura Ingraham later likened her to the children from the film adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s \u201cChildren of the Corn.\u201d (Fox News and MarketWatch parent News Corp NWS, +0.77% share common ownership.)\n\nPresident Trump, for his part, tweeted sarcastic commentary alongside a video clip of Thunberg\u2019s dire warnings: \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d Thunberg later co-opted the description for her bio on Twitter TWTR, +2.61% .\n\nIn a recent interview with \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d CBS, -0.17% Thunberg said that bluntly speaking truth to power and shaming \u201cthose who need shaming\u201d had helped drive home her climate-change message. Another asset, she said, was her neurological diagnosis. \u201cI have Asperger\u2019s, I\u2019m on the autism spectrum, so I don\u2019t really care about social codes that way,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Autistic employees bring a unique perspective to a workplace, and can be highly focused and productive in ways that their neurotypical peers are not.\u2019 \u2014Marcia Scheiner, the president and founder of Integrate Autism Employment Advisors\n\nShe spoke to the perks of neurodiversity, or the idea that neurological differences are human variations rather than diseases to be cured. \u201cThat makes you different; that makes you think differently,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cEspecially in such a big crisis like this one, we need to think outside the box, we need to think outside our current system, we need people who think outside the box and who aren\u2019t like everyone else.\u201d\n\nThunberg previously tweeted, \u201cWhen haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go. And then you know you\u2019re winning!\u201d \u201cI have Asperger\u2019s and that means I\u2019m sometimes a bit different from the norm,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd \u2014 given the right circumstances \u2014 being different is a superpower.\u201d\n\nAutism, which varies in degree and includes several developmental and neurological conditions, is characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, including aversion to eye contact and trouble understanding nonverbal cues. Behavior patterns include repetitive movements and the adoption of specific routines.\n\nAbout one in 59 children has autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The prevalence could be as high as one in 40, according to an estimate published in December by the journal Pediatrics.\n\nMeanwhile, a majority of college graduates with autism are unemployed. Just 14% of adults with autism who use state developmental-disability services have a paying job in their community, according to Drexel University\u2019s 2017 National Autism Indicators Report.\n\nBut many companies in recent years have also acknowledged the \u201csuperpower\u201d of individuals on the spectrum. \u201cAutistic employees bring a unique perspective to a workplace, and can be highly focused and productive in ways that their neurotypical peers are not,\u201d Marcia Scheiner, the president and founder of Integrate Autism Employment Advisors, a nonprofit that helps organizations recruit and retain workers on the autism spectrum, told MarketWatch.\n\nIntegrate has worked with employers including Warner Bros., Prudential PRU, +0.66%, Deutsche Bank DB, +0.00% and JPMorgan Chase JPM, +0.57%, Scheiner said.\n\nSoftware company SAP SAP, -1.20%, which calls individuals on the autism spectrum \u201can underutilized talent source,\u201d says it employs more than 160 workers in 13 countries through its Autism at Work program, which began in 2013. Accounting firm Ernst & Young, which now does business as EY, reportedly employs 60 workers in four U.S. cities through its neurodiversity program.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s Autism at Work program, which piloted in 2015 with four people, now includes more than 140 employees in eight countries performing mostly technology-related roles, the company says. Pilot program participants were faster and more productive than their peers, according to the company. \u201cThere are multiple factors that contribute to this, but the commonalities are strong visual acuity, attention to detail and a superior ability to concentrate,\u201d Autism at Work global head James Mahoney said in a blog post.\n\nThe company aims to have 300 workers in 14 locations in the program by 2020, Mahoney said.\n\nWhile each professional on the spectrum is different and brings just as unique a skill set as any other person, there are some typical skill sets and talents that people on the spectrum bring, Scheiner said \u2014 including \u201cincredible focus,\u201d vast depth of knowledge and a penchant for accuracy. These strengths lend themselves to jobs that require subject-matter expertise, she said, or place an emphasis on compliance or risk management.\n\nWhile employees on the autism spectrum don\u2019t necessarily have different interests than their peers, these individuals\u2019 focus, drive and passion in their area of interest \u201cis often much more enhanced,\u201d Scheiner said.\n\nA neurodiverse workplace doesn\u2019t just benefit professionals on the autism spectrum, she added: Programs that facilitate hiring such workers can boost engagement among fellow employees, some of whom may have relatives or friends on the spectrum. And managers, who often learn to communicate in more clear and direct language with employees on the spectrum, also find that their people-managing skills improve across the board.\n\n\u201cPeople who manage individuals with autism will tell you they just become better managers of everybody,\u201d Scheiner said.", "description": "\u2018We need people who think outside the box and who aren\u2019t like everyone else,\u2019 the 16-year-old Swedish teenager said.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR978_thunbe_ZG_20190924172229.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
