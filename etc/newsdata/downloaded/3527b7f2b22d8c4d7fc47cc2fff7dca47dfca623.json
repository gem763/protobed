A populist cleric who helped install the premier called for his removal.\n\nSecurity forces stationed on the nearby Jumhuriya bridge, lobbed tear gas at protesters in Tahrir Square who tried to break through to the heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign missions.\n\n\u201cWith life and blood we defend you Iraq,\u201d they chanted.\n\nThe crowd consisted mostly of young men, many draped in Iraqi flags. Surrounding streets brimmed with cars, taxis, motorcycles and tuk-tuks as more people made their way in.\n\nEarlier, trade unions announced that they would call strikes, following the lead of lawyers and teachers.\n\nThe latest protest in Baghdad took place after a night of violence in the Shi\u2019ite holy city of Kerbala, where, according to medical and security sources, Iraqi security forces opened fire on protesters and killed at least 18 people.\n\nAt least 865 people were wounded, the sources said.\n\nRelated Coverage Iraq's Sadr calls on rival to join him in ousting PM\n\nKerbala\u2019s governor and police chief, Iraq\u2019s prime minister and the military all denied anyone was killed. But the security and medical sources said local authorities had been ordered to cover the deaths up.\n\nThe United Nations representative in Iraq condemned the violence and called for dialogue.\n\n\u201cThe recent developments across many parts of Iraq, in particular in Kerbala last night, are most alarming. Witness reports indicate that live fire was used against demonstrators, causing high numbers of casualties,\u201d the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) said in a statement.\n\nThe death toll since the unrest started on Oct. 1 is now at least 250 people.\n\n\u201cWe want the government gone. Our demand is not for Abdul Mahdi to resign, if he resigns, it\u2019s not enough. Parliament must go, the parties must go,\u201d protester Salah al Suweidi said in Tahrir Square\n\n\u201cYesterday we broke the curfew and stayed the night, we will do so again today, even if 10, 20, 100, 1,000 die. What happened in Kerbala will not be ignored, the blood of our brothers in Kerbala and other provinces will not be in vain.\u201d\n\nIn southern Iraq, protesters blocked the entrance to Umm Qasr commodities port near Basra, slowing operations by around 80%, port employees and local officials said.\n\nDemonstrators display a banner that reads \"Mercy and Immortality for the Martyrs of the October revolution shame on the government of corrupt criminals\" and \"No homeland no work\" during a protest over corruption, lack of jobs, and poor services, in Baghdad, Iraq October 29, 2019. REUTERS/Wissm al-Okili\n\nHARDSHIP AND CORRUPTION\n\nThe protests, driven by discontent over economic hardship and corruption, have broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq.\n\nThe country has suffered for decades under the rule of Saddam Hussein and U.N. sanctions, the 2003 U.S. invasion and civil war it unleashed, and the battle against Islamic State, which was declared won in 2017.\n\nAn OPEC member, it has vast oil wealth, but many Iraqis live in poverty or have limited access to clean water, electricity, basic health care and education. Most of the protesters are young men who above all want jobs.\n\nMany Iraqis criticize a political elite they say is subservient to one or another of Baghdad\u2019s two main allies, the United States and Iran. These powers use Iraq as a proxy to pursue their struggle for regional influence, without concern for the needs of ordinary people, they say.\n\nDespite promising reforms and ordering a broad reshuffle of the cabinet, Abdul Mahdi has struggled to address the demonstrators\u2019 complaints.\n\nPopulist Shi\u2019ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who backs parliament\u2019s largest bloc and helped bring Abdul Mahdi\u2019s coalition government to power, invited his main political rival Hadi al-Amiri on Tuesday to help him oust the premier.\n\nSadr had asked Abdul Mahdi to call an early election but the premier refused, saying on Tuesday it would be quicker if Sadr agreed with his rival on a replacement.\n\nParliament passed measures on Monday aimed at placating the protesters but many said this was too little too late. These included reduced salaries for officials, formation of a committee to draft constitutional amendments, and the dissolution of all provincial and local councils outside the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region.\n\nThe root cause of grievances is the sectarian power-sharing system of governance introduced in Iraq after 2003, analysts and activists say.\n\nSlideshow (33 Images)\n\nAfter Saddam was ousted, many opposition groups returning from exile divided state positions among themselves after dismantling the civil service under the banner of \u201cde-Ba\u2019athification\u201d, or getting rid of Saddam\u2019s people.\n\nThis was replaced by sprawling patronage networks, not just within the new ruling Shi\u2019ite majority political elites, but also in Kurdistan. Sunni elites eventually followed suit.\n\nThese elites exploited ethno-sectarian grievances. But Iraqis now are rejecting this system, even the Shi\u2019ite majority who after 16 years of leading the government, still find themselves impoverished and undeserved.", "description": "Tens of thousands of Iraqis protested in Baghdad's central Tahrir Square on Tuesday for a fifth day, angered by reports of security forces killing demonstrators in the city of Kerbala and the prime minister's refusal to call early elections.", "authors": ["Ahmed Aboulenein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446281137&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1QL", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
