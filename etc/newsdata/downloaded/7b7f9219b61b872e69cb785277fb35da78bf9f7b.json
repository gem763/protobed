I mean, I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in. You're forgetting that.\"\n\nAsked to explain the attack line in the post-debate spin room, Castro told reporters he had \"proved his point.\" It wasn't meant to be about personalities, he explained. He just wanted Biden to try and defend his health care agenda. And, according to Castro, he did it \"in a respectful way.\"\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) borrowed Castro's attack in his own post-debate interviews. In a discussion with CNN, he shared his concern that Biden has the potential of \"fumbling\" the campaign.\n\nSen. Cory Booker on Juli\u00e1n Castro's jab at former VP Joe Biden's memory: \"Castro has some really legitimate concerns about, can he be someone in a long grueling campaign that can get the ball over the line? And he has every right to call that out.\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rMvlolVf0j \u2014 OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 13, 2019\n\nIt's the same critique President Trump has used in recent weeks. Last month, he told media that Biden was \"not playing with a full deck.\" Last night in Baltimore, as the Democrats were battling in Houston, Trump once more noted the frontrunner's weakness.\n\n\"He has no idea what the hell he\u2019s doing or saying,\" Trump said of Biden.\n\nStill, compared to the last two debate rounds, Thursday night was by far Biden's best performance. He had to come out swinging, as he was placed right between his two loudest progressive critics, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.", "description": ".09/13/2019 14:08:10PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/a4770fca-5d4e-4f5b-803d-b612eb4a9712.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
