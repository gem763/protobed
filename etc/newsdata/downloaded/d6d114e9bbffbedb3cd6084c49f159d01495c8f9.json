This man is out to catch you.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE The Flying Pig Marathon weekend is a treasured Cincinnati tradition the first week in May in Greater Cincinnati. Melanie Laughman, mlaughman@enquirer.com\n\nDerek Murphy was suspicious even before he knew the man\u2019s name.\n\nSitting on the couch in his living room, Murphy squinted at the color-coded spreadsheet on his laptop, checking and re-checking the finish times for this year\u2019s Boston Marathon. Something about the time for runner No. 9974 didn\u2019t add up.\n\nThe first race checkpoint recorded the man running a pace of about 11 minutes per mile, yet his 3-hour finish meant he had to average a 7-minute pace the entire way.\n\nThen Murphy noticed something else: The same runner missed almost every other checkpoint between the start of the race and the finish line. It was as if he\u2019d vanished for most of the 26.2 miles.\n\nMurphy was sure now. He\u2019d caught another cheater.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just know.\u201d\n\nDerek Murphy, a financial analyst from Lebanon, Ohio, is pictured, Wednesday, April 24, 2019, at Bechtold Park in Sycamore Township.

(Photo: Kareem Elgazzar/The Enquirer)\n\nMurphy\u2019s hunches are right more often than not. The middle-aged dad from suburban Lebanon is a financial analyst, a runner of modest talent and the world\u2019s most prolific hunter of people who cheat at marathons.\n\nHe didn\u2019t set out to be that guy, the one pointing fingers at liars and course-cutters who take home medals they don\u2019t deserve and brag on Instagram about finish times they didn\u2019t earn.\n\nMore: Flying Pig streakers are a thing \u2013 but it's probably not what you think\n\nYet here he is, race after race, outing cheaters on his website, marathoninvestigation.com. He does it after most big races, as well as some small ones, and he\u2019ll do it again Sunday when he downloads the official results of Cincinnati\u2019s Flying Pig Marathon.\n\nMurphy describes his detective work as a hobby, but that isn\u2019t entirely right. Stamp collecting is a hobby. Knitting is a hobby.\n\nCatching cheaters is something else entirely. What Murphy does is more of a calling. He pushes back against the notion that a little cheating here or there is no big deal, that dishonesty is just part of the game, or, in this case, the race.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face to the people who put the work in,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt gets at me.\u201d\n\nHe fights back with all the tools at his disposal: Official results, checkpoint times, course maps, a runner\u2019s race history, eyewitness accounts and photos from the day of the race. He relies on intuition, too, as he did with runner No. 9974 in Boston.\n\nIn that case, the numbers told the story. But the clincher, for Murphy, was the photo after the race, in which the runner smiled for the camera as his finisher\u2019s medal rested on a belly that seemed unlikely to belong to a 3-hour marathon runner.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t look the part,\u201d said Murphy, who\u2019s never finished a marathon in less than 5 hours. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of built like me.\u201d\n\nDerek Murphy, a financial analyst from Lebanon, Ohio, is pictured, Wednesday, April 24, 2019, at Bechtold Park in Sycamore Township.

(Photo: Kareem Elgazzar/The Enquirer)\n\nLooking out for honest runners\n\nMurphy, a veteran of about a dozen marathons and ultra-marathons, has no delusions about his running ability. \u201cI can move very slowly for a long time,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he\u2019s a world-class talker when the subject is something he\u2019s passionate about, like running or Excel spreadsheets. Or Excel spreadsheets about running. The words fly when he talks about his work.\n\nMurphy sees in numbers a way to get at a quantifiable truth, something he can measure when other details are muddy. People might lie. But numbers, those he can trust.\n\nSo when Murphy got curious about marathon cheating in 2015, he knew his spreadsheets were the way to get to the bottom of things.\n\n\u201cIt started out as an interest,\u201d he said. \u201cA fascination about why people did it and how they did it.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s confident most runners would rather burn their favorite shoes than claim a time they didn\u2019t earn. But if thousands of runners participate in a marathon, Murphy knows the odds are good a few cheaters are in the mix.\n\nIt may be a sad commentary on human nature, but it\u2019s good for Murphy\u2019s website, which can earn him $1,000 or more a month in advertising and donations, depending on how the cheat-catching business is going.\n\nThe week after the Boston Marathon, his site averaged about 50,000 views a day. The article he wrote about runner No. 9974 got 145,000 views.\n\nHe gets his material from race results and tipsters, who fill his inbox with news of racing malfeasance. One day it\u2019s a woman in Duluth who swapped racing bibs with a faster runner. The next it\u2019s a man in New Orleans who cut short the course in a half-marathon.\n\nRunners who follow the rules flock to the site to vent about the scofflaws. \u201cI find cheating so frustrating,\u201d one commenter wrote after finding out about runner No. 9974.\n\nOthers take it personally: \u201cHim smiling with that medal \u2026 what a turd,\u201d wrote another.\n\nThough there\u2019s no shortage of righteous indignation among his readers, Murphy usually lets the numbers do the talking. He said he\u2019s less interested in shaming cheaters than in helping runners who, because of those cheaters, finish lower in the official results, miss out on an age-group medal or fail to qualify for a premier marathon like Boston.\n\nThe runners who suffer are rarely elite. They are dentists and warehouse workers, accountants and cops, people whose greatest athletic achievement is crossing a marathon finish line. Murphy knows them because he\u2019s one of them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really why I do it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Boston Marathon, a race he\u2019s certain he\u2019ll never qualify for, is particularly close to Murphy\u2019s heart. People work hard to make the field of 30,000, he said, so he works hard to catch bogus qualifiers who might take the spots of legitimate runners.\n\n\u201cIf I can stop 50 people from missing Boston,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nFrom Rosie Ruiz to Mrs. Manziel\n\nBoston is where it started for Murphy. After the 2015 race, he heard rumors about people cheating in qualifying marathons and wondered how often it happened.\n\nHe started digging into the results, comparing qualifying times from marathons in places like Chicago and Cincinnati to the same runners\u2019 times at Boston. If there was a big difference, Murphy dug deeper.\n\n\u201cI was trying to find people who shouldn\u2019t have been there,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd he did. At least 60 runners were, in his view, stone cold cheaters. In most cases, he found they ran slower, probably legitimate times at Boston, but they cut the course or cheated in some other way in the qualifying race to get to Boston.\n\nMurphy was surprised to find so many, if only because cheating is harder than ever. Courses are monitored, cameras are everywhere and computer chips in the runners\u2019 bibs track not only their finish times but their times at various checkpoints.\n\nRosie Ruiz, America\u2019s most notorious marathon cheat, would find it impossible today to jump into the Boston Marathon a mile from the finish and claim victory, as she did in 1980.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty closely monitored,\u201d said Iris Simpson Bush, executive director of the Flying Pig. Only a handful of discrepancies have come up over the years in Cincinnati, she said, and none were confirmed as cheating.\n\n\u201cIt does happen, you could never deny it does,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t prevalent.\u201d\n\nStill, cheaters find a way. Murphy has written about people who slip in and out of races, about a wife who switched bibs with her husband to win age-group medals, and about a man who carried a stack of bibs during a race so slower runners could qualify for Boston with his time.\n\nSometimes, Murphy even encounters a D-list celebrity or two. He broke out his spreadsheets in March when fitness model Bre Tiesi, soon-to-be ex-wife of quarterback Johnny Manziel, was accused of cutting the course in a half-marathon.\n\nMurphy found Tiesi would have had to run a 4-minute mile pace for the second half of the race to post the finishing time she claimed. Either Tiesi had just run six miles faster than any human in history, or she\u2019d cheated.\n\nHow do runners like Tiesi react when he calls them out? Murphy shrugged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not usually positive,\u201d he said.\n\n'Play by the rules'\n\nMurphy said he tries to contact runners with questionable results before posting a story about them. Sometimes there\u2019s an explanation for the discrepancies \u2013 a wrong turn on the course, a malfunctioning chip, an honest mistake.\n\nSometimes cheaters admit what they did and disqualify themselves, and sometimes there are excuses or more deception. Murphy believes one runner went so far as to fake GPS data from her watch to cover her tracks.\n\n\u201cIf they admit it and withdraw, I don\u2019t write about it,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s when they double down that it gets interesting.\u201d\n\nEvery now and then, things get ugly. One person threatened Murphy\u2019s wife on Facebook and another made references to mass shootings while griping about him.\n\nThe confrontations are the hardest part for Murphy. He enjoys the chasing more than the catching.\n\n\u201cI like doing the work, figuring it all out,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like conflict.\u201d\n\nMurphy doesn\u2019t speculate about why runners cheat. He knows some are desperate to qualify for Boston, but for the rest, the motive seems to be little more than a desire to post a photo on social media and bring home a medal.\n\nJack Lesyk said that sounds about right. He\u2019s a runner and a clinical psychologist at the Ohio Center for Sports Psychology.\n\nHe said people driven primarily by internal forces set personal goals and work to achieve them, while those driven by external forces want validation from others in the form of trophies, praise and Facebook likes.\n\nIt\u2019s that latter group, he said, that\u2019s most likely to cheat. And although some might consider course-cutting or bib-swapping a victimless crime, Lesyk said there\u2019s value in Murphy\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cI really do think we should take a strong stand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to play, play by the rules.\u201d\n\nBut does Murphy\u2019s sleuthing really matter, or is it, as some of the people he\u2019s caught have claimed, just another form of public shaming? Should he take the advice he hears most often from them and just \u201cget a life\u201d?\n\nOn his bad days, Murphy wonders about that himself. \u201cSometimes I get burned out on it,\u201d he said. \u201cI step away a little.\u201d\n\nBut then he\u2019ll get a tip about an egregious case, or he\u2019ll skim some race results and see a few numbers that don\u2019t add up. He\u2019ll think about the runners who do things the right way, the ones, like him, who train long hours and run long distances and expect nothing more than an honest race.\n\nAnd he\u2019ll just know. It\u2019s time to get back to work.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/01/cincinnati-flying-pig-marathon-dont-cheat-man-might-catch-you/3640249002/", "description": "Cincinnati's Flying Pig Marathon is Sunday.
