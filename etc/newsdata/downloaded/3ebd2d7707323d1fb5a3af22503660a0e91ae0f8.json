THE USA IS GREAT!\u2019\n\nDonald Trump issued tweets threatening to \u2018obliterate\u2019 Turkey\u2019s economy amid mounting criticism of his decision to withdraw US troops from Northern Syria, which is currently controlled by allied Kurdish forces\n\nTrump appeared to be lashing out after being roundly criticized over the withdrawal, which is likely to see Kurdish forces who played a key role in the US defeat of Isis attacked by Turkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurkey, which shares a border with the area of Northern Syria affected by the announcement, has claimed it is only interested in helping prevent the resurgence of Isis.\n\nBut political pundits say it does not have the military capacity to do so, and that its President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is far more interested in driving the Kurds from the region where they have historically lived.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham \u2013 one of the president\u2019s most vocal supporters \u2013 was among those joining in the condemnation.\n\nSenator Graham tweeted: \u2018It is never wise to abandon an ally who has sacrificed on your behalf.\n\nTrump and Erdogan pictured last year. The US president has been accused of leaving Kurdish allies at the mercy of a hostile nation\n\n\u2018It is never wise to repeat the mistakes of your predecessor.\n\n\u2018It is never wise to outsource American national security to Turkey or any other nation.\n\n\u2018Turkey does not have the capability to keep ISIS from re-emerging and their primary target is the Kurds \u2013 not ISIS.\n\n\u2018It would be unwise to believe otherwise.\u2019\n\nGraham claims the US will use economic sanctions to keep Turkey in check if necessary.\n\nFormer US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, previously known for her closeness to Trump, also criticized the president.\n\nShe tweeted: \u2018We must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back.\n\n\u2018The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria.
