This is serious stuff and this is a serious warning about our President,\u201d Twelve publisher Sean Desmond told CNN.\n\nThe secret author is being represented by veteran literary agents Keith Urbahn and Matt Latimer of Javelin, who also worked with former FBI director James Comey for his book, A Higher Loyalty.\n\nAccording to Latimer, his client turned down huge sums of money for the book and plans to give away a large chunk of what is made from sales.\n\n\u201cThe Author of A WARNING refused the chance at a seven figure advance and intends to donate a substantial amount of any royalties to the White House Correspondents Association and other organizations that fight for a free press that seeks the truth,\u201d Latimer told CNN, adding the book \u201cwas not written by the author lightly, or for the purpose of financial enrichment. It has been written as an act of conscience and of duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere obviously will be those who want the author to reveal themselves publicly, but there are good reasons for that not to happen,\u201d added Latimer. \u201cThe author feels their identity is almost irrelevant because there is scarcely a sentiment expressed in this book that is not shared by numerous others who have served and continue to serve this administration at its highest levels.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the author behind the September 2018 Times op-ed infamously claimed to be part of a group of officials \u201cworking diligently from within\u201d to impede President Trump\u2019s \u201cworst inclinations.\u201d\n\nThe alleged official, who claimed to be part of the so-called \u201cresistance\u201d inside the government, wrote, \u201cMany Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump\u2019s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous,\u201d the unnamed official writes, yet \u201cthe president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough he was elected as a Republican, the president shows little affinity for ideals long espoused by conservatives: free minds, free markets and free people. At best, he has invoked these ideals in scripted settings. At worst, he has attacked them outright,\u201d the author continued.\n\nPresident Trump and other White House officials unloaded on the op-ed, calling it a \u201cgutless editorial\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody has ever done in less than a two-year period what we have done,\u201d the president said at the time. \u201cSo when you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration, probably who\u2019s failing, and probably here for all the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nThen-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also called on the secret author to \u201cdo the right thing and resign\u201d from the administration.\u201cThe individual behind this piece has chosen to deceive, rather than support, the duly elected President of the United States. He is not putting country first, but putting himself and his ego ahead of the will of the American people. This coward should do the right thing and resign,\u201d said Sanders.", "description": "The\u00a0anonymous author of an NYT op-ed claiming to be part of the\u00a0\u201cresistance\u201d inside the Trump administration will publish a \"tell-all\" book.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/donald-trump-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
