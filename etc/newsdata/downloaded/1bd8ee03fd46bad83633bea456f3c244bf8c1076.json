The Standing Committee is also worried that the same mistake that happened in the previous financial year will recur, where infrastructure grant was moved from the province to Eastern Cape due to lack of planning and underspending,\" said Dliso.\n\nPost audit action plan\n\nDliso urged the department to submit a detailed post audit action plan, with proper timelines and a comprehensive report on consequence management with details on all cases and action taken.\n\n\"The department must involve all law enforcement agencies to ensure that supply chain transgressors are apprehended... We need effective inter-governmental relations between departments to ensure that our people are provided with good schools.\n\n\"We also need a comprehensive report on schools infrastructure rollout plans and projects list and their status quo,\" he said.\n\nJohannes Mohlala, who was appointed to stabilise teaching and learning activities in the department, said six officials were served with notices to provide justifiable reasons for irregular expenditure incurred and subsequent to their submissions.\n\nMohlala said R4.1m was cleared after consultation with the Auditor-General.\n\n\"While certain officials resigned or were dismissed, the department is in the process of appointing an independent audit/accounting firms to investigate irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure and guide on consequence management,\" said Mohlala.\n\nHe also said the department is currently engaged in the finalisation of a memorandum of understanding with the Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) towards the public entity serving as an implementing agent.\n\n\"Upon our engagement with the Department of Public Works and Roads, we discovered that it does not have enough technical and professional support on the building environment hence we employed 16 professionals within the infrastructure Chief Directorate,\" Mohlala said.", "description": "North West Standing Committee on Provincial Public Accounts called on the provincial  department of education to address irregular expenditure of over R1bn.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8009/cab7e4bacefb45ecbe74b3942de2e88a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
