But Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was not minded to revel in this last-gasp win, suggesting that the duel with Besiktas had been uncomfortably fraught.\n\nGabriel Martinelli\u2019s double sends Arsenal surging past Standard Li\u00e8ge Read more\n\n\u201cWe won but the performance must be much better,\u201d he said, indicating that he remains unsatisfied with his team\u2019s form despite achieving this victory on the back of Saturday\u2019s win over Watford, their first in the Premier League this season. \u201cWhy did some of the players not perform so well? We must find out why, this is my obsession.\u201d\n\nIt was heartening to hear him recognise that all was not perfect when others might have taken the easy option of describing this as a textbook away win in Europe, the decisive goal coming after Wolves absorbed a lot of pressure. Wolves at their best would not have been run so close by a team as limited as Besiktas, who are struggling domestically and short of top talent. Even the atmosphere was not as fearsome as billed, with the hosts\u2019 travails leaving them unable to attract a full house.\n\nBesiktas began by dominating possession and Wolves seemed content to just fend them off. By the 20th minute Besiktas had created so little that the home fans began to barrack them for passing sideways. It was music to Wolves\u2019 ears.\n\nWolves could have made the home side panic. Instead they were too circumspect, effectively inviting Besiktas to regain courage and attack. Jeremain Lens began to worry Jonny Otto down the right, while Adem Ljajic darted about between the lines and chinks of vulnerability began to appear in the Wolves defence.\n\nThe home side nearly broke through before the break. Mohamed Elneny, the midfielder on loan from Arsenal, tried to reintroduce himself to the Premier League side by scoring from six yards, but his header from a corner by Ljajic flew over the bar.\n\nJust before half-time another corner caused even more trouble, with a deflection leading Conor Coady to slice it towards his own goal. The defender was grateful to see the ball bounce out off a post before he blocked Dorukhan Tokoz\u2019s follow-up.\n\nManchester United draw blank with AZ Alkmaar as Jesse Lingard misses mark Read more\n\nBy half-time Wolves had failed to test the reliability of Besiktas\u2019s other player on loan from the Premier League, with Liverpool\u2019s Loris Karius practically a spectator, albeit not as loud as the ones now cranking up the volume in the home crowd.\n\nNuno tried to push his team on the front foot by putting on Adama Traor\u00e9 for Pedro Neto. That did give Wolves more impetus, but Besiktas were the first to threaten after the break, Caner Erkin forcing a save from Rui Patr\u00edcio from long range. That was the game\u2019s first shot on target.\n\nWolves soon mustered an effort of their own, albeit without troubling Karius, as Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez headed over a free-kick by Jo\u00e3o Moutinho. On the hour Boly met a corner from the right but headed over from six yards. With the game opening up, Domagoj Vida flashed a header inches wide in the 68th minute.\n\nIn the final 10 minutes Patrick Cutrone, on as a substitute for Jim\u00e9nez, fired wide of the far post after being released by a counterattack.\n\nWolves thought they had snatched victory in the dying minutes when Romain Sa\u00efss turned the ball into the net from close range after a header from a corner had been spilled. The linesman ruled it out for offside and with VAR not being used in the Europa League group stages there was no prospect of the decision being overruled.\n\nNo matter, Wolves did the business themselves, securing victory in stoppage time when Boly fired home at the back post.", "description": "Willy Boly\u2019s injury-time goal gave Wolves a 1-0 win over Besiktas in the Europa League", "authors": ["Paul Doyle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d8cd3d01c1e7fcab85fe57feb00916d2906d3b/20_35_2968_1781/master/2968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3bb849d85116aebe25eeac9671eaedff"}
