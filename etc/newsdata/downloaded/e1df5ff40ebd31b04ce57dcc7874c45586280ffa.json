With the bill de-scheduling industrial hemp and hemp-based derivatives, cannabis retail has flourished. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t quite say the same about pot stocks to buy.\n\nCall it a case of misplaced expectations. While the federal government green-lighting industrial hemp opened the doorway to products such as cannabidiol (CBD), business is still business. Essentially, investors weren\u2019t willing to cut much slack for pot stocks simply because of a groundbreaking law.\n\nAs publicly traded cannabis firms produced disappointing earnings results, stakeholders increasingly lost their patience. With none of the major players stepping up, investors headed for the exits. Botanical specialists were no longer stocks to buy but stocks to dump while the going was good.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, the disappointment wasn\u2019t just limited to financial underperformance. A tragic and unfortunately-timed vaping crisis added to the woes. Several companies had invested deeply into cannabis-based vaping products, which are now under suspicion.\n\nIs the ride over in pot stocks? For the conservative investor, going green isn\u2019t the most appropriate strategy. Then again, this market subsegment has never advertised itself as a paragon of stability.\n\nFor the risk-takers and contrarians, though, I believe pot stocks to buy are compelling, especially at these levels. With sentiment at rock bottom, this sector probably has nowhere to go but up. Further, the hysteria around cannabis products is misplaced, which I will demonstrate throughout this list.\n\nTherefore, if you\u2019ve got the nerve, here are 10 pot stocks to buy that are on discount:\n\n\n\n\n\nTilray (TLRY)\n\nWith Profitability Nowhere in Sight, Tilray Stock Has Further to Fall More\n\nSource: Jarretera / Shutterstock.com\n\nDuring the height of the marijuana craze, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) was easily one of the most celebrated pot stocks to buy. At one point, TLRY stock touched $300 on an intra-day basis. Now, with shares just above $20 a pop, Tilray has absorbed one of the most devastating losses in recent memory.\n\nBut if you\u2019re new to this market, I\u2019d take another look at TLRY stock. For one thing, shares are very close to their initial public offering price of $17. In addition, hedge funds are starting to turn bullish on the embattled organization.\n\nThey have reason to be. Mostly, Tilray specializes in medical marijuana solutions. As a result, they have more legal leeway to distribute their products. Keep in mind that Tilray was the first company to import medical marijuana into the U.S. Moreover, growing global support for medicinal cannabis bodes well longer-term for TLRY stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nCanopy Growth (CGC)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAt the peak of its dominant market presence, analysts sang praises of Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC). Here was an aggressively expanding company that provided the blueprint for success for other \u201cweedpreneurs\u201d to follow. Specifically, the bulls loved that Canopy inked a deal with beverage maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ). With resources in hand, Canopy could drive their expansion, thereby lifting CGC stock.\n\nAt least, that was the theory. But in reality, pot stocks \u2013 like any other investment class \u2013 had to follow the rules. This is where the underlying organization stumbled. Gradually, stakeholders lost confidence in Canopy\u2019s aggressive growth strategies. Furthermore, Canopy had gambled heavily on vaporizer products, months before the current lung illness epidemic. In a panic, CGC stock deflated badly.", "description": "As we approach the one-year anniversary of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, or the \"farm bill\" as it's better known, much has changed in the cannabis industry.
