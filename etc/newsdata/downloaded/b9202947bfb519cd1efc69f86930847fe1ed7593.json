Times reports that Trump\u2019s abrupt order three weeks ago for the U.S. withdrawal from Syria \"disrupted the meticulous planning underway and forced Pentagon officials to speed up the plan for the risky night raid before their ability to control troops, spies and reconnaissance aircraft disappeared.\"\n\nThe bottom line: Trump chose the option that took out the leader of ISIS, who inspired thousands of terrorists in dozens of countries.\n\nIn an interview with Swan that aired last night on \"Axios on HBO,\" Iraqi President Barham Salih \u2014 long known as a pro-American leader \u2014 warned that the U.S. withdrawal from Syria could increase the danger of an ISIS resurgence.\n\nThe nearly hour-long interview was conducted last Monday, in one of Saddam Hussein's old palaces.\n\nSalih says he is no longer sure he can rely on the U.S. as an ally \u2014 and may be ready to \"recalibrate\" Iraq's relationship with other countries, including Iran and Russia.\n\nSalih also said he was \"worried\" about war breaking out between the U.S. and Iran \u2014 and said Iraq can't afford to pick sides in such a war.\n\nBrett McGurk \u2014 who served under President George W. Bush as senior director for Iraq and Afghanistan, and Presidents Obama and Trump as special envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS \u2014 writes for WaPo:\n\n\"Trump deserves full credit for approving the operation that led to Baghdadi\u2019s demise. It\u2019s a shame the information that led to the raid apparently did not come to him before the tragic decision to abruptly pull U.S. Special Forces from much of northeastern Syria.\"\n\n\ud83e\udd4a \"Because everything we already know about the raid reinforces just how valuable, unique and hard-fought the small and sustainable American presence there had been.\"\n\nWhat's next ... David E. Sanger writes in the N.Y. Times: \"[W]hile the raid achieved its goal, it did little to resolve the question of whether Mr. Trump\u2019s instinct for disengagement will create room for new strains of violent radicalism that he and his successors will be forced to clean up.\"\n\nGo deeper: Iraq's president reveals Trump fears; warns of war, ethnic cleansing", "description": "The president says he wants to end endless wars, but events keep pulling him back.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/dtwgiSbqVGkHCsIsnuKd4HqD0iY=/0x469:4056x2751/1920x1080/2019/10/28/1572258764339.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
