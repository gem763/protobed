In fact, it took just 300 days. Its original name was Flakturm IV (Flak Tower IV) and its new name is the Hochbunker located in St Pauli district of Hamburg. It is living proof of the wartime past of Germany. The bunker has been in use even after the end of World War II. It accommodated civilians to take care of the housing crisis in the postwar period.\n\nLater it became a hub of business including a German TV station. There were also nightclubs, radio stations, and studios. It will now become a luxury hotel with a lush rooftop garden and a new travel destination.\n\nCNN describes the bunker. Germany built hundreds of bunkers in Hamburg during the war. The Hochbunker was one of the largest and concentration camp laborers who carried out the work. It was a massive structure with 11.5 feet thick walls.\n\nIt was impenetrable and could accommodate 18,000 people. The entrance was wide enough and capable of handling women pushing baby carriages. It served as a shelter to people during the summer air raids of 1943.\n\nFrom CNN: Huge Nazi bunker to house luxury hotel with lavish roof garden Huge Nazi bunker to house luxury hotel with lavish roof garden - Future Trump property?https://t.co/fgZGOyznEk \u2014 Karen Kirkpatrick \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\ude0e\ud83c\udf34 (@phinneykirkpat1) October 18, 2019\n\nNazi bunker to become a luxury hotel\n\nNH Hotel Group has plans to remodel the bunker into a 136-room luxury hotel complete with modern amenities like a bar, caf\u00e9, and restaurant and could open its doors in mid-2021.\n\nThere will be a rooftop park and a memorial center for the victims of Nazi Germany.
