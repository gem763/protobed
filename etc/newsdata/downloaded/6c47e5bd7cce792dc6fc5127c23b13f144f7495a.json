But just keeping the mindset that we were going to win the game. Never let it leave our minds.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons scored 16 consecutive points in the final quarter and took the lead on a 1-yard run by Taven Birdow with 3:15 left.\n\nHowever, Perry led an 11-play, 75-yard scoring drive to claim the victory in the first leg of the Commander-In-Chief\u2019s Trophy. Navy linebacker Tony Brown returned a fumble 8 yards in the closing seconds to round out the scoring.\n\n\u201cWe found a way to win,\u201d Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo said. \u201cThat is a great team win. We went back and forth. We needed to step up and we did.\u201d\n\nPerry finished with 111 yards on 23 carries with a pair of touchdowns. He also completed 5 of 7 passes for 144 yards.\n\nA fumble by Navy fullback Nelson Smith gave Air Force the ball on the Midshipmen 37 midway through the fourth quarter. The Falcons capitalized on a 1-yard plunge by quarterback DJ Hammond III that pulled them within 21-19 with 7:38 left in the game.\n\nThe Falcons (3-2) then put together a six-play, 72-yard scoring drive, capped by the scoring run by Birdow to take their first lead since the first quarter before the Midshipmen (3-1) rallied.\n\n\u201cWe came here and played our hearts out,\u201d Falcons defensive tackle Jordan Jackson said. \u201cWe did not play good enough to win.\u201d\n\nAir Force kicker Jake Koehnke converted all four of his field-goal opportunities, including a career-long 49-yard kick that pulled the Falcons to within 14-9.\n\nHammond had 71 yards on 12 carries. He also competed 10 of 25 pass attempts for 205 yards with an interception.\n\nJake Springer managed a key sack in the third quarter that gave Navy a short field, setting up the 20-yard scoring run by Perry that provided a 12-point margin.\n\nThe Midshipmen used an almost identical strategy to boost the lead to 14-3. Perry completed a 28-yard pass to Mychal Cooper and Smith capped the drive with a 3-yard scoring run.\n\n\u201cThey made a few plays and some really fine plays, too,\u201d Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said about Navy.\n\nThe Commander-In-Chief\u2019s Trophy is presented annually to the winner of the football competition among the three major service academies - Army West Point, Navy and Air Force. The Black Knights took home the crown the previous two years.\n\nUp next, Navy visits Tulsa on Oct. 12.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nAir Force: The Falcons have not won in Annapolis since 2011. The loss also takes them out of the running for the Commander-In-Chief\u2019s Trophy. After averaging 34.6 points over the opening four games, Air Force never fully got into sync against Navy until the final quarter.\n\nNavy: It was an uplifting win for the Midshipmen, who were routed by Air Force 35-7 last season in Colorado Springs. When the Falcons stacked the box, Perry showed he could be effective throwing the ball downfield to set up a couple of scores. The Midshipmen can win their first Commander-In-Chief\u2019s Trophy since 2015 with a victory over Army on Dec. 14.\n\nBIG CROWD\n\nThe game had an announced attendance of 37,957 \u2014 the fourth-largest crowd in the history of Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. It was also the eighth-consecutive time this matchup sold out in Annapolis.\n\nCLEAN GAME\n\nAir Force had just one penalty for 12 yards. Navy was penalized seven times for 52 yards.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Malcolm Perry had a 4-yard touchdown run with 23 seconds remaining to give the Navy Midshipmen a stunning 34-25 victory over Air Force on Saturday", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Todd Karpovich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/aptopix_air_force_navy_football_24832_c0-139-3310-2068_s1770x1032.jpg?3dd5b789d5f5f75ea169d86dcdcd43bb9349f191", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
