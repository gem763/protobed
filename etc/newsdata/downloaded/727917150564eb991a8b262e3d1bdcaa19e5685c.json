USA TODAY Handout\n\nCaptivating and grim, \"The Lighthouse\" (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd out of five; rated R; now playing in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., expanding wider through fall) is a tempestuous descent into a briny abyss urging its audience to pack a life preserver.\n\nThe 19th century tale's protagonist, Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson), is a timberman who's left behind the excess of the forest for the solitude of the ocean as a lighthouse keeper's apprentice. As second in command (out of two people) on this jagged rock jutting out of the abyss, he's left with the unsavory duties of manual labor as the senior keeper watches on.\n\nWilliem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson star lighthouse keepers seemingly on the brink of madness in \"The Lighthouse.\" (Photo: Eric Chakeen/A24 Pictures)\n\nWinslow just wants to keep his head down and get to work. He's taken over the undesirable post after another worker went crazy on the job. Boredom, Winslow's boss tells him, makes men into villains. But, just like Jack Torrance, he begins hallucinating, believing the very myths and horror stories he once dismissed.\n\nPattinson's wild eyes and stark, smooth white visage contrasts to co-star Willem Dafoe's weathered and gaunt mug. Tight shots of their faces are some of the film's most breathtaking, like when the bewitched would-be Batman wades into the shallows lit only by the moon on a quest for some mermaid tail.\n\nThe elder wickie Thomas Wake, brought to life by Dafoe, ensnares Winslow in an exasperating trial of arduous physical labor and emotional torment. Theirs is the grimmest living situation committed to memory since Joan Crawford and Bette Davis duked it out in \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\"\n\nNo, Robert Pattinson didn't get drunk filming 'Lighthouse': But 'I ate quite a lot of mud'\n\nHoliday movie preview: 15 movies you absolutely must see this holiday season, from 'Star Wars' to 'Frozen 2'\n\nEphraim (Robert Pattinson) loses his grip on reality \"The Lighthouse.\" (Photo: A24 Films)\n\nDafoe's role is one part Captain Ahab, one part Baby Jane Hudson and a pinch of Jack Sparrow. He's given a lot to play with for a character who's introduced through a series of grunts, burps and farts.\n\nBesides the bodily functions of Wake, the rhythm of waves crashing, seagulls cawing and machines humming on this isolated rock are some of the constants that carry from the dead of night to daybreak. Well, those and that all-knowing light that illuminates dark secrets best left under the surface.\n\nPhew! Robert Pattinson was 'absolutely relieved' to get the call to play Batman\n\nGet ready for Halloween: The 50 best horror movies of the 2000s, ranked\n\nDirector Robert Eggers, who constructed an enthralling puritanical glimpse at supernatural terror in 2015's \"The Witch,\" again combines folklore, isolation and madness in this nightmarish setting. While a lighthouse is often thought of as a signal of safety in violent waters, Eggers' beacon is a menacing omen that blinds its keepers, delectably driving them to depravity.\n\nBut there is some humor mixed in this disturbing flick fit for Edgar Allen Poe enthusiasts. Pattinson and Dafoe drunkenly dance in each other's arms throughout the nights, argue like children and guzzle booze after the rations are gobbled up. What else is there to do when Neptune himself could barrel straight through the window?\n\n\"The Lighthouse\" feels terrifying due to its remoteness and distance from the present. Things seem all the more menacing and foreboding when there's so little technology and an insistence that a craggy old man's curse to a sea god could very well bubble out from the screen and wash over the audience.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/24/the-lighthouse-review-robert-pattinson-bizarre-new-film/4091283002/", "description": "\"The Lighthouse\" stars Robert Pattinson, Willem Dafoe make the worst roommates since Bette Davis, Joan Crawford in \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\"", "authors": ["Garrett Mitchell", "Published P.M.
