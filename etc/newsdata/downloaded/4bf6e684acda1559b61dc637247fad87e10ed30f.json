The man\u2019s statements to reporters after his arrest, in which he described himself as a prophet and said his victims had been chosen by God to fight in a war between \u201cangels and demons,\u201d suggest a motive complicated by delusions and possible mental illness.\n\n\u201cHe said he likes killing people,\u201d said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd in a statement Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe alleged murder spree began on Oct. 2 in Greeneville, Tenn., where police found Christopher Scott Short lying in a pool of his own blood behind a laundromat. Security footage showed a man, allegedly Mossburg, force Short into the building\u2019s bathroom at gunpoint, the Florida sheriff who arrested him said at a news conference Tuesday. The pair emerged after Scott had been bound, and walked to the back of the laundromat. Judd said the Tennessee man died from stab wounds.\n\nAccording to the Polk County sheriff, Mossburg stole Short\u2019s truck and drove to his sister\u2019s home in his hometown of Spartanburg, S.C. Police later found the truck in a nearby scrapyard. Judd said the suspect\u2019s sister bought him a bus ticket to Orlando.\n\nWow! Here\u2019s a look at the home where @PolkCoSheriff SWAT and deputies arrested triple murder suspect Stanley Mossburg after barricading himself for hours. @WFLA pic.twitter.com/GKGPQvv7Qi \u2014 Melissa Marino (@WFLAMelissaM) October 15, 2019\n\nThe tattoo-heavy Mossburg, nicknamed \u201cWoo Woo,\u201d had been arrested for nonviolent crimes in his South Carolina hometown in the past, Judd said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStanley \"Woo Woo\u201d Mossburg Arrested Sheriff Judd is briefing the media this morning with an update on the arrest of Tennessee fugitive and Winter Haven double homicide suspect Stanley \"Woo Woo\u201d Mossburg. Mossburg killed two people in Winter Haven on Sunday night. He was taken into custody early Tuesday morning by PCSO SWAT after being barricaded in a house off of Dundee Road on Monday night. Click here to read the news release: http://bit.ly/2ONApv9 Posted by Polk County Sheriff's Office on Tuesday, October 15, 2019\n\nBy Friday, Mossburg was allegedly selling items to a pawnshop in Polk County and on Sunday, police say, he invaded another home in the lake-filled Florida city.\n\nJudd said at Tuesday\u2019s news conference that Mossburg tied up a man and a woman living inside the home. A third roommate came home from work around 10:30 p.m. Sunday, the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release. For more than 14 hours he allegedly trapped his victims, tied to chairs and restrained inside different rooms in the house.\n\nThe third roommate, who survived the attack, told police the woman he lived with had been alive when he arrived at home. She told him \u201cjust do what he says and he won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d Mossburg allegedly told the man he\u2019d killed the other man who lived in the house in the master bedroom. Then, the victim said the intruder bound his hands with computer cords inside the home\u2019s office. He allegedly murdered the woman later in the night. Both victims who died had been stabbed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday evening, the living victim escaped the house after Mossburg fled in a stolen car. He called 911 from a neighbor\u2019s phone.\n\n\u201cStanley Mossburg told our victim he wanted to be a serial killer,\u201d Judd said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials had not named the Winter Haven victims by late Tuesday evening and did not immediately respond to The Washington Post\u2019s request for comment.\n\nJudd said Polk County sheriff\u2019s deputies found the stolen car and another vehicle Mossburg had been known to drive near an intersection in Winter Haven, a city about 50 miles southwest of Orlando.\n\nAs police searched a home they thought he could be hiding at around 9 p.m. Monday, Mossburg fired two gunshots from his hiding spot. The officers retreated and called for backup, the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SWAT team rolled in with its Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, a military-grade weapon sometimes called an MRAP that the sheriff\u2019s office purchased at a steep discount before 2015. Officers urged the man to come out over a PA system, and fired a \u201cchemical agent\u201d into the house to smoke him out. But the South Carolina man stayed and fired again at the deputies.\n\nThe SWAT team and Mossburg remained locked in a standoff until just after 5 a.m. Tuesday. Then, deputies drove the armored military vehicle into the garage, where they found Mossburg cowering under a pool table. The officers sent a K-9 unit to pull the man out, and finally arrested him as he fought the dog.\n\nOfficers took Mossburg to a hospital to be treated for injuries sustained in the standoff, Judd said. As deputies walked him from the hospital to a patrol car after he received treatment, reporters pressed Mossburg for an explanation for his alleged crimes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing what God tells me to do. Y\u2019all will see God and there\u2019s going to be an angels and demons fight from God,\u201d he said, WFTS reported. He told reporters he was \u201ca prophet, not a serial killer\u201d and claimed he\u2019d killed the victims because \u201cGod needed them.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officials said Tuesday that Mossburg told the surviving Winter Haven victim that his roommates were his seventh and eighth victims, but there\u2019s no evidence so far to support the claim he killed anyone else. Mossburg allegedly said he wanted to kill 11 people.\n\nThe Polk County sheriff suggested Mossburg deserves the harshest of penalties for the alleged killing spree.\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s killed at least three people,\u201d Judd said. \u201cHe tried to kill our deputies last night. This guy needs the death penalty if there\u2019s ever anyone who needed the death penalty.\u201d\n\nMossburg was booked into the Polk County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, the sheriff\u2019s office said. He faces 14 felony charges, including multiple counts of first-degree murder, attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, and armed burglary and one misdemeanor charge for resisting arrest. His arraignment is scheduled for 1 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nAD", "description": "Stanley Eric Mossburg allegedly killed at least three people before being captured by a SWAT team in Winter Haven, Fla.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TaR-oCe5dF8Fcao8zGu1z9zCDVI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QRRQ5OWRPVCDRORZ4NGBAHCI6I.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
