News that West has forbidden their 6-year-old North from wearing makeup or crop tops.\n\n\u201cNorth is trying to get in on the makeup, but she\u2019s being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager,\u201d Kardashian said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now, but it is what\u2019s best.\u201d\n\nKardashian said she and her hubby \u201crealized we didn\u2019t really want her to wear makeup at a young age, but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s fashion rules don\u2019t stop there.\n\nHe told an interviewer earlier this week that he doesn\u2019t allow his daughter to bare her midriff, either.\n\n\u201cA smart man has the ability to pivot to say I think something different now. I don\u2019t think this because it\u2019s the culture,\u201d West said. \u201cI don\u2019t think North should wear crop tops just because I had her wearing a slip dress when she was 2 years old.\u201d\n\nWest has made his taste in fashion \u2015 for other people \u2015 well known. On an episode of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d this month, viewers saw him tear into his wife\u2019s designer corset look for this year\u2019s Met Gala. The rapper famously purged Kardashian\u2019s closet of clothing and accessories during a 2012 episode of the reality show.\n\nWest also reportedly made great personal demands on the people who worked on his upcoming album, \u201cJesus Is King,\u201d asking them to avoid premarital sex, food and other jobs while making the record.\n\nPHOTO GALLERY Kanye & Kim Matching Outfits", "description": "Kim Kardashian said their 6-year-old daughter's makeup issue is causing \"a big fight in the household right now.\"", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db31b5e2000009228506cce.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
