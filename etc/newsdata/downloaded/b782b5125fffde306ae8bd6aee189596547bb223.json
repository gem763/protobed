Bush.\n\nDeGeneres defended her friendship with Bush on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d on Tuesday. In her explanation of the photo \u2014 in which she was shown laughing with the former Republican president at a Dallas Cowboys game over the weekend \u2014 the liberal LGBTQ advocate stressed the importance of kindness.\n\nYes, that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend. Here\u2019s the whole story. pic.twitter.com/AYiwY5gTIS \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have,\u201d DeGeneres said.\n\n\u201cWhen I say be kind to one another,\u201d she added, \u201cI don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone.\u201d\n\nJamil shared the video of DeGeneres\u2019 explanation Tuesday on social media \u2014 much like Reese Witherspoon and her \u201cThe Good Place\u201d co-star Kristen Bell.\n\nNBC via Getty Images Kristen Bell as Eleanor, Jameela Jamil as Tahani in an episode of \u201cThe Good Place.\u2019\n\nIn the now-deleted tweet, Jamil, who is British, praised DeGeneres\u2019 handling of the backlash.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone in the public eye handle something like this, in this way,\u201d she said, according to BuzzFeed. \u201cAnd use it to make what is actually an incredibly necessary point in our society. It was just very strong and interesting. We explore this in season 4 of The Good Place.\u201d\n\nSoon after sharing the post, Jamil got a fair amount of heat for supporting DeGeneres.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jamil replaced her deleted tweet with a new one.\n\nIn her new post, the actor said that, after \u201clearning today about the full extent of Bush\u2019s heinous presidency,\u201d \u201cI now understand the rage.\u201d\n\nOoooof learning today about the full extent of Bush\u2019s heinous presidency... we weren\u2019t taught much about him at school, we just heard he was stupid...(we were dealing with our own epic nightmare of a prime minister back then). What a monstrous leader. I now understand the rage.. \u2014 Jameela Jamil \ud83c\udf08 (@jameelajamil) October 9, 2019\n\nJamil also said in her post that when she was attending school in the United Kingdom, she wasn\u2019t taught much about Bush other than hearing \u201che was stupid.\u201d In a reference presumably about Tony Blair, said that Brits \u201cwere dealing with our own epic nightmare of a prime minister back then.\u201d\n\nJamil did experience some criticism for not knowing more about Bush when she was a teenager in the U.K. but retorted, \u201cAre you experts on all world leaders from back then?\u201d\n\nVery interesting to see some pompous responses from people because someone from the other side of the world didn\u2019t learn about a president in your country when they were a teenager. Are you experts on all world leaders from back then? Ridiculing learning and growth is weird. \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffd \u2014 Jameela Jamil \ud83c\udf08 (@jameelajamil) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cI love learning and growth and massively applaud anyone who says they don\u2019t/didn\u2019t know the answer and seeks it out,\u201d Jamil followed up in another tweet. \u201cI personally think that\u2019s cool and hope that we all feel safe to do that, so we can all evolve together.\u201d\n\nI love learning and growth and massively applaud anyone who says they don\u2019t/didn\u2019t know the answer and seeks it out.

The Iraq War cost the U.S. more than $5.6 trillion, according to a 2018 Brown University study. Brown also found that an estimated 250,000 civilians died in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan during Bush\u2019s supposed \u201cwar on terror.\u201d", "description": "\"The Good Place\" star has changed her stance on the controversy surrounding the talk show host's friendship with former President George W.
