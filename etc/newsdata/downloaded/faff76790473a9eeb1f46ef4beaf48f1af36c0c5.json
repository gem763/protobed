She is a professor of poverty alleviation and development economics at the US college.\n\nThe French-American Nobel laureate received the MacArthur \"genius\" Fellowship in 2009 and was named as one of the \"forty under forty\" most influential business leaders by Fortune magazine in 2010.\n\nThe book she wrote with Banerjee, Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty, won the Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year award in 2011.", "description": "The winner of this year's Nobel economics prize, Esther Duflo, said she hopes her win will \"inspire many, many other women to continue working.\"", "authors": ["Vicky Mckeever"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106180336-1571067535444new.jpg?v=1571067566", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
