His \u201cBetween Now and Success\u201d podcast interviews with smart folks in and around the wealth management industry focus, in Steve\u2019s words, on the intersection of business, investing and life.\n\nWe asked Steve to share a few of the most impactful ideas he\u2019s taken from his recent podcasts, in the form of a Q&A, and he\u2019s provided plenty of food for thought.\n\nQ: Describe one compelling idea you\u2019ve learned recently from a podcast guest about growing a practice.\n\nA: No coach would ever put their players on the field without a playbook, without a game plan to win the game. Yet, so many advisors rely on passive referrals or an inconsistent marketing strategy to try and generate new business.\n\nAdvisors Dennis Morton and Kathryn Brown of Morton Brown Family Wealth took a page from the sports world and created a business development playbook that diagrams, organizes, and tracks the results of their lead to client business development process.\n\n\u201cThe playbook lays out in a continuum, how someone goes from being a cold or warm name, through all of the stages, steps, tools, and resources that lead to them becoming a client,\u201d said Dennis.\n\nAnd the playbook is embedded as CRM workflows that fire automatically when a new step in the playbook is reached, added Kathryn. The combination of the playbook and automation ensures no leads slip through the cracks. Listen to the podcast.\n\nQ: Describe one compelling idea you\u2019ve learned recently about better serving clients.\n\nA: I\u2019ve never met a client that wants to be \u201cscaled,\u201c have you? Scaling your business involves using technology to be fast and efficient. But Ross Levin, co-founder of Accredited Investor, says excelling in \u201cthe slow things is something that is really important, because that\u2019s the part that technology, I don\u2019t believe, can overcome.\u201d\n\nThe slow things are the conversations and the life changes, and being on the front end of dealing with people through their day-to-day existence and through all the major things that go on in their life, said Ross.\n\nThere\u2019s no technology that will enable two humans to increase the speed at which they\u2019re having an in-depth conversation. Your advantage over the \u201cfast\u201d players like robo-advisors is to excel at these slow things and staff and price your services accordingly. Listen to the podcast.\n\nQ: Describe one compelling idea a guest shared recently about balancing work and personal life/ health.\n\nA: Richard Branson famously said, \u201cI don\u2019t think of work as work and play as play, it\u2019s all living. And I\u2019ve found that the most successful people follow Branson\u2019s thinking and aim for work-life integration, not work-life balance.\n\nTwenty-year Navy SEAL veteran David Sears told me work-life balance is not two scales that you add one weight to and, \u201cOoh, I spent eight hours at work, now I have to spend eight hours of play. That\u2019s not how it works. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s more of a yin and yang thing. Your work and play are inter-meshed. When you play, you gain this diversity of experiences in different things that fire off connections that you don\u2019t know exist. You won\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to connect until you get outside of your work.\u201d Listen to the podcast.\n\nSteve Sanduski, CFP, is the founder of Belay Advisor; the CEO of ROL Advisor, a discovery process technology system; a New York Times bestselling author; host of the Between Now and Success podcast and a financial advisor business coach.", "description": "Veteran advisor coach Steve Sanduski shares some of the best ideas from his recent podcast guests.", "authors": ["Steve Sanduski"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110090/social", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
