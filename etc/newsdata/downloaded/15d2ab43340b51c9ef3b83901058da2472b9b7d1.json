The Google executive seemed surprised by the question but eventually agreed that they should indeed be informed.\n\n\u201cGosh, I haven\u2019t thought about this before in quite this way,\u201d Osterloh states. \u201cIt\u2019s quite important for all these technologies to think about all users\u2026 we have to consider all stakeholders that might be in proximity.\u201d\n\nOsterloh finally decides: \u201cDoes the owner of a home need to disclose to a guest? I would and do when someone enters into my home, and it\u2019s probably something that the products themselves should try to indicate.\u201d\n\nOsterloh pointed out that some Google devices do attempt to make users aware when they\u2019re recording, such as the Nest cameras which shine an LED light when they\u2019re in record mode. Osterloh was also questioned about Google\u2019s other data collection techniques, specifically the recent reports that Google contractors targeted individuals with darker skin tones to perform facial recognition tests on.\n\nFrom the BBC News interview:\n\nThere\u2019s been controversy over facial-recognition tests carried out on the phone\u2019s behalf. To make sure it worked better with dark skin tones, there\u2019s been reports a contractor targeted homeless people offering them $5 (\u00a34) but didn\u2019t properly explain what was going on. Can you address that? It was very important for us to make sure the face unlock system works for all different kinds of people, genders, races, et cetera. And as a consequence, we wanted to make sure we were able to get a large number of data points that allowed us to perfect this model in a fair way. So, we went out and did a lot of research in this area. It\u2019s come to our attention there may be some methods that were not approved, not how we would do business. So, we\u2019re investigating that. We would never find that acceptable. And so we\u2019ve suspended any data collection until this is straightened out. Just to be clear about what you think is unacceptable. Was it the targeting of homeless people? Was it not explaining exactly what people were testing? Or what? All of those allegations would be different than what we would find acceptable. But do you still plan to retain the data collected in this way for 18 months? I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve discussed the length of time that we\u2019re holding data. But there have been no changes to the programme with respect to data retention.\n\nRead the full interview by BBC News here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
