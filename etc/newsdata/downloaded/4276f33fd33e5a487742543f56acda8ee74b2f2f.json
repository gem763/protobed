As record-breaking fires tear through the rainforest, one Brazilian biologist is spreading the word through art.\n\nIt takes Emerson Munduruku hours to transform into the drag persona, U\u00fdra Sodoma.\n\nPainted green beneath a straw headpiece, U\u00fdra paddles to remote villages along the Amazon river. Their goal? Teaching local children how to respect and protect the forest.\n\nRecently, U\u00fdra made their first international trip to Canada to attend the Arctic/Amazon symposium , an event that brings together Indigenous artists from both regions.\n\nArtist and activist Emerson Munduruku is pictured as they teach environmental conservation to children through their drag queen alter ego, U\u00fdra Sodoma, at the Sustainable Reserve of Anavilhanas in the state of Amazonas in northern Brazil, on July 21, 2018. (Ricardo Oliveira, AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"I worked in scientific research, but I had to move to art because we can reach out to more people,\" U\u00fdra told q host Tom Power. \"It's a more important dialogue.\"\n\nU\u00fdra was born in 2016, when protesters across Brazil were calling for the impeachment of then-president Dilma Rousseff. The creative demonstrations got them thinking about how to share their work with a wider audience.\n\n\"I've spent many years writing scientific articles for other countries, while my own community didn't have access to this knowledge\" said U\u00fdra. \"Through art, when I walk around, I see peoples' reactions. It's already a way to start a dialogue.\"\n\nU\u00fdra Sodoma with q host Tom Power and translator Jananda Lima. (Vivian Rashotte/CBC)\n\nWhen asked about the fires burning through the Amazon, U\u00fdra sighed. They trace the increase in fires this year to policies enacted by Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.\n\n\"I feel angry. I feel sad, but at the same time I'm hopeful because that is my home,\" they said. \"And I know that my home is capable of having strength to rebuild \u2014 to fight back.\"\n\nClick the 'Listen' link near the top of this page to hear the full conversation with U\u00fdra Sodoma.\n\n\u2014 Written and produced by Vanessa Greco", "description": "These are unprecedented times for the Amazon region.
