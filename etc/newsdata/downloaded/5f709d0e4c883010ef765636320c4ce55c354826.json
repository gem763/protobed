But for the rest of us\u2014the majority of filers who submit expense claims only a few times a year\u2014the task can be one of the worst parts of a job.\n\nHow people handle expense reports reveals a lot about their attitudes toward their employer, and their emotional baggage about money. Based on corporate research and insights from psychologists, here are a few common expense-reporting profiles:\n\nThe Sidestepper\n\nSome people find completing expense reports too confusing, tedious or anxiety-provoking to bear. About 10% of employees don\u2019t file for reimbursement even when they\u2019re entitled to it, according to a 2018 survey of British workers. Some resent the time required to scan receipts, list contacts and itemize fees and taxes.\n\nOthers fear awkward conversations with managers who ask, \u201cWhy did you expense that coffee for $1.50?\u201d says Tim Hird, an executive vice president with the staffing firm Robert Half.\n\nManaging financial details makes some people so anxious or impatient that they\u2019d rather give up the money, says Kate Levinson, author of \u201cEmotional Currency,\u201d a book about the feelings aroused by money issues. Some sidesteppers feel so guilty that they hide their expense-reporting lapses from their spouses, she says.\n\nThe Martyr\n\nThis employee is so inspired by his employer\u2019s mission that he treats his company like a charity. He may not file for reimbursement at all, paying expenses as a way of supporting the company, says Liz Fosslien, co-author of \u201cNo Hard Feelings,\u201d a book about embracing emotion at work. She\u2019s seen that pattern among employees of Silicon Valley startups and tech companies.\n\nOn the flip side, others\u2019 lavish spending can show they\u2019re mainly out for themselves, Ms. Fosslien says. A senior executive at a company where she once worked gained a reputation shortly after being hired for lavish dinners and expensive flights. \u201cHe was just wildly overspending. It sent a strong signal to others that he wasn\u2019t there for the right reasons,\u201d Ms. Fosslien says. The executive soon left the company by mutual agreement, she says.\n\nThe Payback Artist\n\nKeenly conscious of fairness, these employees see money as an instrument of power. They may have been raised in a household where cash was used to control family members, leading them to pay close attention to expenses, Dr. Levinson says.\n\nThose who feel undervalued\u2014believing that they\u2019re paid too little or the CEO\u2019s eight-figure paycheck is too high\u2014are likely to file for every dime spent, Dr. Levinson says. \u201cThis is an easy way to express that resentment without losing your job,\u201d she says.\n\nThey\u2019re also likely to go out and say, \u201cLet\u2019s expense this! This round of drinks is on the company,\u201d Ms. Fosslien says. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking, \u2018I deserve better and I\u2019m going to get it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOthers\u2019 expense reports scream of alienation. Eileen Timmins, a Chicago human-resources executive, recalls an incident at a previous employer. One employee was upset when her employer refused to reimburse her for a $150 basket of fruit and cheese she\u2019d bought as a gift for a conference sponsor. The employee\u2019s response: \u201cAll right, I know how to work the system,\u201d Ms. Timmins says. She began aggressively filing for every allowable outlay, regardless how small.\n\nThe Rookie\n\nIt\u2019s common for employees in their 20s and 30s not to have read their employers\u2019 expense policy. But they often worry about getting in trouble for overspending, according to research by SAP Concur, an expense, travel and invoice management company. Decisions that are obvious to senior colleagues cause them considerable angst. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what\u2019s normal,\u201d says Mike Volpe, chief executive of Lola.com, a corporate travel-management platform.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How do you handle expense reports? Join the conversation below.\n\nEmployers often tell employees to spend the company\u2019s money as if it were their own. Young workers may think that means sharing a hotel room with a co-worker or booking the cheapest flight regardless of time wasted on layovers, says Steve Isom, vice president of finance at Flywheel, a company that helps clients build and manage websites.\n\nOthers err in the opposite direction. When Brett Hicks mentioned the guideline to a former colleague with a habit of ordering expensive business meals and multiple cocktails, he replied, \u201cI am spending the company\u2019s money the way I\u2019d spend my own,\u201d says Ms. Hicks, training and development manager at Flywheel in Omaha.\n\nDecisions made under stress are especially difficult. Product manager Jack Sellwood, also of Omaha, was tired after working several days at a conference in Berlin, his first international business trip. Told by a colleague at the airport that employees were expected to show up at the office the following day, he decided at the last minute to upgrade his ticket to business class so he could get some sleep.\n\nHis employer didn\u2019t agree, and docked his next paycheck to cover the added cost, he says. Still, the sleep was worth it, Mr. Sellwood says. \u201cI\u2019d do it again.\u201d\n\nThe Grifter\n\nFueled by a sense of entitlement, this employee pushes reimbursement requests to the limit\u2014and beyond. Some 56% of CFOs have seen a rise in questionable expense filings in the past three years, according to a recent survey of 1,000 CFOs by Robert Half. Questionable items ranged from pet-sitting and bedbug removal to a pogo stick and a string of pearls. Such items suggest employees know they can push their companies\u2019 boundaries, Mr. Hird says.\n\nWhile reckless spenders are often fired, rainmakers sometimes get away with it. Jack McCullough tells of a sales vice president at a former employer who regularly asked to be reimbursed for three meals a day, five days a week, all costing just under $25\u2014the threshold at which the company required receipts. \u201cWhen I implied he might be stretching the rules, he went ballistic on me,\u201d says Mr. McCullough, president of the CFO Leadership Council, a professional group.\n\nMr. McCullough, who works in North Andover, Mass., lowered the receipt threshold to $15 in an attempt to block the maneuver, but the salesman reduced his reported per-meal expense to $14.99 or less. Mr. McCullough took the issue to the man\u2019s boss. \u201cHe said, \u2018I know this salesman is a crook, but we make more money letting him steal from us than we would from somebody who is honest,\u2019 \u201d Mr. McCullough says. Lacking other options, they let the issue go.\n\nWrite to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com", "description": "How you handle the costs you run up on company time can hint at whether your job is making you happy, or even your sense of ethics and fairness.", "authors": ["Sue Shellenbarger", "Sue.Shellenbarger Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EX426_Workfa_SOC_20190906161600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
