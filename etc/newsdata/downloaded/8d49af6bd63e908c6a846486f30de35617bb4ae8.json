At times, it\u2019s merely a sales tactic, where similar books are grouped together in a bookstore to make them easier to find. But it can also be a codified canon of literature in which authors are engaged in a decades-long conversation, bouncing themes and tropes off one another. Every now and again, a book or author will come along that really breaks away from the conversation and ignores those tropes and conventions. One recent example is Singaporean author JY Yang, who published the final installment of their genre-blending Tensorate series last month.\n\nThe series is made up of four short novellas: The Red Threads of Fortune, The Black Tides of Heaven, The Descent of Monsters, and The Ascent to Godhood. It\u2019s set in a world where an oppressive monarchy called the Protectorate is facing an entrenched revolution from a rebel group called the Machinists. The Protectorate holds onto power by controlling who can utilize a magical system known as Slackcraft, and it utterly controls the lives of its subjects. However, it\u2019s grown decadent and corrupt over the decades, and under the reign of Lady Sanao Hekate, The Protector, it\u2019s brutally cracked down on its citizens. That\u2019s given rise to the Machinists, who work to topple the government, all while bringing power to the people with the help of machines that take the place of Slackcraft and those who control it.\n\nYang plays out their story through an incredible blend of science fiction and fantasy. There\u2019s magic, dinosaurs, weird scientific experiments, spycraft, revolutionaries, mad scientists, and more, all packed into the four books. The Red Threads of Fortune and The Black Tides of Heaven each tell the story of Sanao Hekate\u2019s children: Mokoya, who has prophetic visions, and Akeha, who can innately understand what motivates people into action. Akeha leaves the Grand Monastery to join the Machinists, while Mokoya sets off on her own after the death of her daughter, hunting Naga, giant monsters that roam the world.\n\nIn The Descent of Monsters, we follow Chuwan Sariman, a Tensorate investigator who is trying to piece together what happened at an experimental science facility, and who ultimately finds a horrifying conspiracy that shows just how far the Protectorate will go to hold onto its power. In the latest and final installment, The Ascent of Goodhood, we learn how the Protectorate came to be, and how Sanao Hekate became its leader.\n\nthe arc of Yang\u2019s story feels is eerily relevant in 2019\n\nThe arc of Yang\u2019s story feels eerily relevant in 2019. It\u2019s a story about the balance of power in society, and how corruption sets in quickly, no matter what one\u2019s original intentions are. We see glimpses of how that happens: the experimental and immoral programs that the Protectorate sets up to try and hold onto power, and the lengths that the Machinists will go to take on their enemies. Along the way, Yang shows how those conflicts impact the people involved, and how they rationalize what they\u2019re fighting for.\n\nThe series hails from Tor.com, an imprint of Tor Books that\u2019s been experimenting with digital-first, and shorter novellas and novelettes for the last decade. The same publisher released Martha Wells\u2019 fantastic Murderbot series, which demonstrated that long-form storytelling doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be in the structure of your standard novel. Wells played out Murderbot\u2019s story in four installments, each with their own arc and characters.\n\nYang takes an unconventional approach to their story\n\nYang takes that a step further in their series: not only are they sketching out a massive world and story between the four installments, they\u2019re playing with the form that those stories take. The Red Threads of Fortune and The Black Tides of Heaven are relatively conventionally told, but Yang takes a slightly different approach with The Descent of Monsters, writing out a thriller through the use of official reports, documents, and letters. The Ascent of Goodhood, meanwhile, is a one-sided conversation between Lady Han and an unnamed partner.\n\nWith that unconventional approach, Yang plays out a much larger story than the four slim books would otherwise suggest. We get the outlines of a grand history and epic struggle between an oppressive empire and the people who oppose it. In the form of an fantasy saga, this story might have been written with excruciating detail (looking at you, George R.R. Martin), but here, Yang covers the high points, telling the stories of the key characters, and allowing the reader to connect the dots and put together how they fit alongside one another. It\u2019s an appealing format, especially for an impatient reader like myself.", "description": "Singaporean author JY Yang recently finished out their Tensorate series: four novellas \u2014 The Red Threads of Fortune, The Black Tides of Heaven, The Descent of Monsters, and The Ascent to Godhood \u2014 which blends science fiction and fantasy, all of which play out an epic story of a revolution against a corrupt empire.", "authors": ["Andrew Liptak", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3baNdG_bmb2e5GkhdVFwqvEjh6c=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18428467/aliptak_190801_3582_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-03"}
