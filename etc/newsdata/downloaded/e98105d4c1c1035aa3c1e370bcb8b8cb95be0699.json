If the design is sound, the investigation will move to examining the construction process.\n\n\"The one thing I find hard to understand is the collapse started at the rear of the building (by Rampart and Iberville streets) but it wound up, you had collapsed slabs all the way on the front end of the build, which is 300 feet away (on Canal Street),\" he said. \"So I don\u2019t know how that progression worked like that. I guess that\u2019s part of what the investigation is going to reveal.\u201d\n\nThis aerial photo shows the Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans, which was under construction, after a fatal partial collapse on Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019. More\n\nWhile he believes it\u2019s too early to have an answer as to what caused the collapse, the spread of damage around the edge of the property \u201ccertainly raises questions\u201d for Zehner.\n\n\u201cLogically, it doesn\u2019t make sense it would happen that way. There\u2019s got to be a reason for that to happen, and that's going to be part of the investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nZehner heard the rumors of too heavy a load being placed atop the building or of a vehicle nudging a column. The city also experienced a drop in temperature between Friday and Saturday, but Zehner said the 11-degree swing was likely not drastic enough to affect building materials.\n\n\u201cIdeas have been tossed out that some kind of activity in the building might have caused it. Probably makes more sense than anything, and I think it\u2019s a matter of finding out what was going on at that time. There were people working. What were they doing that could have contributed to this?\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s kind of early on before anyone can start speculating what the actual cause was.\u201d\n\nThe $85 million project\u2019s design is now helmed by architecture firm Harry Baker Smith and constructed by Citadel Builders. Kailas Companies acquired the property for $3.6 million in 2007, though it wasn\u2019t until 2018 that the project was announced as a Hard Rock Hotel.\n\nThere have been questions in the aftermath of the collapse as to whether the site was properly inspected and up to date on all permits.\n\nNew Orleans Director of Homeland Security Colin Arnold said that is being investigated.\n\nThere is no evidence that an ongoing federal corruption investigation focusing on the Department of Safety and Permits is connected to the Hard Rock Hotel project. But the agency has dealt with the challenges such cases present.", "description": "Structural engineer Walter Zehner worked on the project before it became a planned Hard Rock Hotel.
