This reminds me of Joe Biden\u2019s recent comment: \u201cWe believe in facts, not truth.\u201d It is the truth that Mr. Trump won by 12 percentage points, and Mr. Bishop only by 2, but left out here is the quite important fact that court-ordered redistricting occurred between the 2016 election and this week\u2019s special election. This required North Carolina to alter its districts so they were no longer structured to favor the GOP.\n\nSo the North Carolina 9th District that Mr. Trump won four years ago is not the same one Mr. Bishop won just days ago. In fact, the district now includes many more Democrats than it did in 2016. That\u2019s the fact the media\u2019s \u201ctruth\u201d has simply ignored, constituting, in my opinion, journalistic malpractice.\n\nBOB SEGAL\n\nBurke, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
