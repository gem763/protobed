I\u2019ll camp out in the squat rack all workout, and nobody cares. But since hogging the squat rack is a classic jerk move, it got me thinking: maybe I am the jerk at my local gym.\n\nWe are all, perhaps, the jerk in somebody else\u2019s eyes. Context matters, too: I can still sleep at night because I only hog the squat rack when the gym is otherwise empty. But just in case, I\u2019ve gathered a list of the jerk moves people seem to complain about most, and what to do if it turns out you\u2019re the jerk.\n\nHow To Establish A Gym Habit, Based On Your Goals People who go to the gym every day tend to be happy with their habit \u2014 that\u2019s why they keep coming back. But plenty of folks aspire to do that, and haven\u2019t quite figured out how. Since I am one of those people (I even work out on holiday, sorry) I\u2019d like to help you learn to love the gym \u2014 but it depends what kind of person you are. Go ahead and read whichever sections apply. Read more\n\nYou leave weights on the bar and walk away\n\nYour justification: Somebody else is just going to put weights right back on it\n\nThe reality: Plenty of people in the gym don\u2019t intend to warm up with 61kg, ok? Especially smaller people, people who are new to lifting, or people who like to start their workouts light. There are plenty of folks who would have trouble even getting a 20kg plate off the bar, because they only intend to bench the empty bar or maybe the bar plus a couple of smaller plates. We all had to start somewhere.\n\nThere\u2019s another issue: when you empty the bar and walk away, it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re done with your workout. But if you walk away while the bar is loaded, people figure you\u2019re resting for a moment and you\u2019ll be right back. Please unload your bar to clearly signal that the station is free.\n\nYou don\u2019t wipe your sweat off things\n\nYour justification: Nobody cares. I don\u2019t sweat that much. The wipes are too far away.\n\nThe reality: People notice. They care. Maybe not everybody, but enough that whenever I ask about the biggest jerk moves in the gym, this one often tops the list. Just go get the darn wipes, or at least lay down a towel.\n\nYou play your music out loud\n\nYour justification: It\u2019s good music!\n\nThe reality: This is literally what headphones are made for. You can listen to your music, other people can listen to theirs. Your gym is probably already playing music over the loudspeaker, so your neighbours definitely don\u2019t want to hear a battle of the bands from multiple tinny speakers.\n\nIf headphone cords are the problem, either go wireless or run the cord under your shirt. You can figure this out. I believe in you.\n\nHogging equipment\n\nYour justification: I\u2019m not done yet\n\nThe reality: OK, but people are still waiting. If you must do a bunch of sets on the same equipment, at least look around from time to time and be aware of who\u2019s lurking around optimistically. Offer to let them work in.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing a circuit type workout, where you use multiple items in quick succession, don\u2019t expect to lay claim to everything for your whole workout. Some circuits just aren\u2019t doable in a busy commercial gym. And if you\u2019re at the gym with a friend, be aware of what you\u2019re sitting on (or blocking access to) while you chat between sets.", "description": "I love going to a not-very-popular gym at off-peak hours.
