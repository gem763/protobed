They will also attend university freshers fairs to explain how to register to vote.\n\nLabour activists pledge to create most radical manifesto ever Read more\n\nThere are five target seats with a sitting Tory MP and high youth populations on which Momentum are keen to focus. They have worked out that if 19,000 young voters register across the seats of Walsall North, Truro and Falmouth, Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Loughborough and Cities of London and Westminster, they could all switch to Labour.\n\nThey also want to protect Labour marginals that have large youth populations but majorities smaller than 1,600.\n\nThis includes Kensington, which is held by Labour with a majority of just 20, Lincoln, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Portsmouth South, Warwick and Leamington, and Canterbury. All of these seats typically have a university or a large further education college in the constituency.\n\nThousands of people are understood to have registered to vote since the prorogation of parliament. Momentum\u2019s drive to ensure students are signed up was sparked in part over fears the Tories were trying to hold an election on a date that would have made it very difficult for students to register to vote in time.\n\nThe Times reported how Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign team had factored in that an 15 October polling date would have restricted the number of students registering to vote as many would be moving house and may not be able to provide an address until the registration date had passed.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, No 10 believed if students remained registered at their home address, they would have been less inclined to vote when election day came around.\n\nParker said: \u201cJohnson\u2019s attempt to rig the election and stop students from registering is deplorable, and it\u2019s heartening to see so many young people getting registered in response.\u201d\n\nLabour is far more popular among students than any other political party according to polls, although this summer the party hit a four-year low in support from students.\n\nAt the next election, Johnson is facing a challenge from 24-year-old Labour candidate Ali Milani and also Liberal Democrat Elizabeth Evenden-Kenyon.", "description": "Interface will help users choose whether home or university most favourable place for Labour victory", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1ec8bb76361b24e5eaa8c5a79ecc7ae4870faa1/0_106_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=23f876bfddac55f1d241a52dea256cea", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
