So we\u2019ll see how that plays out. It seems like there\u2019s a new day approaching.\u201d\n\n\u201cSNL\u201d has drawn the president\u2019s ire over their portrayal of him by actor and ardent Trump critic Alec Baldwin, calling it a \u201ctotal Republican hit job.\u201d\n\nMr. Baldwin won an Emmy for his portrayal of the president in 2017 and despite saying in June he was \u201cso done\u201d with playing Mr. Trump, he reprised the role during the show\u2019s 45th season this year.\n\nMr. Thompson also said he wants to see other 2020 presidential candidates make cameos such as Sen. Kamala Harris, who Maya Rudolph portrayed last month.\n\n\u201cI mean, I think it would be funny to see Kamala do it with Maya on the show. That would be a lot of fun,\u201d he said, adding that the 2016 appearance of Sen. Bernard Sanders alongside the actor portraying him, \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u2019s\u201d Larry David, was \u201cawesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be giving equal time to anybody, so I guess the door\u2019s open to whoever,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
