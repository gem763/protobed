(AP Photo/Steve Karnowski)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local):\n\n6 p.m.\n\nAnti-Trump protesters are converging on the Minneapolis arena where President Donald Trump is holding his first political rally since the House opened its impeachment inquiry.\n\nProtesters are packing streets surrounding the Target Center hours before the Republican president is due to appear at Thursday's rally.\n\nMany are clutching helium-filled balloons depicting Trump as a baby. Others are blowing whistles, a nod to the whistleblower whose complaint encouraged Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch the inquiry.\n\nLora Torgerson, who says she is a registered Republican from suburban Inver Grove Heights, is among the anti-Trumpers. She says she has \"never been more ashamed of our party.\" Torgerson says she did not vote for Trump.\n\nTrump supporters are turning out in force and are expected to easily fill the roughly 20,000-seat arena. Some had lined up a day earlier to guarantee a seat.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is trying to convert the impeachment investigation in Washington into a political asset \u2014 scheduling three reelection rallies over the next eight days.\n\nThe rally set for Thursday night in Minneapolis is the first since Democrats began proceedings two weeks ago to remove him from office.\n\nIt'll serve as a proving ground for the president as he tries to use the impeachment inquiry to energize supporters for his 2020 campaign.\n\nTrump has lashed out in tweets and public statements at Democrats, the media and even some Republicans as impeachment has dominated the headlines. He's claimed that he's the victim of a \"coup\" \u2014 although impeachment is a constitutional process\u2014 and has accused Democrats of trying to undo the 2016 election.", "description": "Anti-Trump protesters are converging on the Minneapolis arena where President Donald Trump is holding his first political rally since the House opened its impeachment inquiry.
