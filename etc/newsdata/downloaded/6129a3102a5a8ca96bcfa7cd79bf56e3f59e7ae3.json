So, as attacks are made against Shoprite and other such institutions, it is actually the property owned by Nigerians within Nigeria and the people working there are Nigerians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"XENOPHOBIC VIOLENCE\"\n\nShoprite said several stores in South Africa, Nigeria and Zambia were closed and extensive damage had been done to several supermarkets over the past 24 hours.\n\n\"The retailer is highly concerned about the acts of xenophobic violence against foreign nationals,\" the grocer added in its statement.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa told officials and business leaders on Wednesday that he was committed to quelling attacks on foreigners.\n\nThe latest wave of unrest in South Africa has raised fears of a recurrence of violence in 2015 aimed at foreigners and in which at least seven people were killed. Before that, some 60 people were killed in a wave of unrest around the country in 2008.\n\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said on Tuesday he was urgently sending a special envoy to meet with Ramaphosa to secure the \"safety of (Nigerian citizens') lives and property\".\n\nAdditionally, Nigeria's Vice President Yemi Osinbajo won't be going to the World Economic Forum's Africa summit in South Africa, Onyeama said at his briefing. Osinbajo was slated to attend.\n\n\"Clearly with this climate, he and Mr. President have agreed that he should not go,\" Onyeama said.\n\nNigeria is also considering recalling its ambassador to South Africa, he said.\n\nSouth African police have yet to pinpoint what prompted the violence, which began on Sunday when protesters armed with makeshift weapons roamed the streets of Pretoria's business district, pelting shops with rocks and petrol bombs and running off with goods.\n\nThe police have arrested almost 300 people and confirmed several deaths after the riots.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Chijioke Ohuocha, Afolabi Sotunde, Alexis Akwagyiram, Camillus Eboh and Felix Onuah in Abuja and Nqobile Dludla in Johannesburg; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by Louise Heavens/Deepa Babington and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)", "description": "ABUJA/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African companies MTN and Shoprite closed stores in Nigeria on Wednesday in the face of attacks targeting their premises in retaliation to similar violence in their home country.
