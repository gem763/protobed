Danone cited tough comparison bases in Europe for its waters business in particular.\n\nDanone widened its guidance of like-for-like sales growth toward the lower end. It now sees like-for-like sales growing 2.5%-3%, compared with previous guidance of 3%. For the first nine months of the year, like-for-like sales grew 2.1%, the maker of Activia and Alpro said.\n\nDanone backed its target of having a recurring operating margin above 15% for 2019.\n\nWrite to Cristina Roca at cristina.roca@dowjones.com; @_cristinaroca\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 18, 2019 01:49 ET (05:49 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
