The pact runs to March 2020.\n\nSaudi Arabia has blamed regional foe and fellow OPEC producer Iran for the Sept. 14 drone and missile strikes on two major oil plants, saying a preliminary investigation showed the weapons used were Iranian and that the attack came from the north. Tehran denies the charge.\n\nPutin said that while Russia condemns such acts, there was no confirmed information about who carried out the assault.\n\nHe said anything that upsets market stability should be met with a \"responsible response\", but did not elaborate.\n\nHe said Moscow would work with Riyadh and its other Arab partners to \"reduce to zero\" attempts to destabilise energy markets.
