In May 2017, he was looking online to try to find someone who looked like him and \u201cwore clothes well\u201d, so he could find out where they shopped.\n\n\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t find anyone, so I Googled \u2018plus-size\u2019 males and came across an article about an agency looking for models,\u201d he said. Samuels went for a meeting at Bridge \u2013 which describes itself as a \u201ccurve\u201d agency \u2013 and within two weeks he was featured in an advertising campaign for the brand BoohooMAN. \u201cIt just took off,\u201d he said. \u201cMy face was all over the [London] Underground.\u201d\n\n\n\nSamuels, 27, is just one of an increasing number of men who don\u2019t have chiseled abs and a six-pack to find themselves in demand by fashion brands wanting a share of the growing plus-size men\u2019s market. Modelling agencies are reporting a rise in interest in bigger male models, as more brands, from Asos and Boohoo to River Island have started to cater to men in larger sizes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe women\u2019s curve market has become really well established in recent years,\u201d said a spokesperson for the major international agency IMG. \u201cWe feel the men\u2019s market will follow suit.\u201d The agency is looking for more men to join its \u201cBrawn\u201d division, which currently has three models.\n\n\n\nCharlotte Griffiths set up the Bridge modelling agency in 2014 with the aim of representing models who promoted \u201cdiversity and healthy, positive role models\u201d. \u201cWe were talking a lot about how important it was to have women of a range of shapes and sizes and of different ethnicities, and I remember some people saying it was hypocrisy just to focus on diversity for women,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBridge started representing plus-size men in 2016 and it now takes up as much of the business as the women\u2019s market. In May the agency opened its first office in New York which focuses exclusively on male models. \u201c[The men\u2019s market] has been around about three years and the women\u2019s market has been around for 30 years. It\u2019s really interesting to see that the demand is now 50/50 for us as an agency,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nThe definition of \u201cplus-size\u201d is often determined by brands, says Griffiths, but they generally look for a chest measurement of 45 inches and above. \u201cOur priority was to find models who were big and tall and broad who would be large, XL and above, but who were still representing a healthy body and lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is to have a variety of healthy shapes and sizes and show that these male models could look good without being ripped with a six-pack.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe demoralising effect of having one, often unattainable, body-type held up as the ideal is not just felt by women, said Griffiths. \u201cThe more we looked into it the more we found that men were suffering from the same feelings of insecurities and misrepresentation and they weren\u2019t looking that certain way with a six-pack.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriting for the Chubstr, a fashion website for big and tall men, Zach Miko \u2013 the first model to sign with IMG\u2019s Brawn division \u2013 said in May: \u201cI model because I know that doing this makes a difference. Even if it\u2019s just for the kid who goes by themselves to the middle school dance. I model for the boy who cried into his pillow after his first boy/girl pool party.\u201d\n\n\n\nSamuels says it certainly had an effect on him. \u201cYou start feeling bad about yourself and you start feeling like maybe the answer is to lose weight. To starve yourself or go on a low-carb diet or something like that, but that\u2019s not the solution. I did lose some weight but it still didn\u2019t make me happy and \u2013 because of my natural body shape \u2013 the clothes still didn\u2019t fit how I wanted them to.\u201d\n\n\n\nNemar Parchment, a 6ft 2in man with a 40in waist and a 50in chest, was working as a buyer for Asos when he was first approached about modelling. The brand was launching its Big and Tall range and was struggling to find models, he said. \u201cWhen they stopped me and approached me I kind of thought it was a prank. I never in a million years thought it was a possibility, because I\u2019d never seen anyone out there look like me.\u201d\n\n\n\nParchment joined IMG last year. \u201cOh my gosh, I love it,\u201d he said of modelling. \u201cFirstly, the travelling \u2013 this year alone I\u2019ve been to LA, San Francisco, Palm Springs. I also love the feeling that I\u2019m breaking down barriers.\u201d", "description": "One man found work for an agency while looking online to find clothes that could fit him", "authors": ["Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d968c6cd723759963488dd03b9da59b936c2973b/0_23_3300_1979/master/3300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7d9e50ed23d4c6552f16012290867bd", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
