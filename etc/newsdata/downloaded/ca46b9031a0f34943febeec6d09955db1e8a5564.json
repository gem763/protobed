It\u2019s not the most advanced home observatory, but the retired NASA scientist treasures his Celestron telescope, which was made in 1978. That also happens to be the year Kessler published the paper that made his reputation in aerospace circles. Assigned to the Environmental Effects Project Office at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, the astrophysicist had gotten interested in the junk that humans were abandoning in the wild black yonder\u2014everything from nuts and tools to defunct satellites and rocket stages the size of school buses.\n\nIn that seminal paper, \u201cCollision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt,\u201d Kessler painted a nightmare scenario: Spent satellites and other space trash would accumulate until crashes became inevitable. Colliding objects would shatter into countless equally dangerous fragments, setting off a chain reaction of additional crashes. \u201cThe result would be an exponential increase in the number of objects with time,\u201d he wrote, \u201ccreating a belt of debris around the Earth.\u201d\n\nAt age 38, Kessler had found his calling. Not that his bosses had encouraged him to look into the issue\u2014\u201dthey didn\u2019t like what I was finding,\u201d he recalls. But after the paper came out, NASA set up the Orbital Debris Program Office to study the problem and put Kessler in charge. He spent the rest of his career tracking cosmic crap and forming alliances with counterparts in other nations in an effort to slow its proliferation. His description of a runaway cascade of collisions\u2014which he predicted would happen in 30 to 40 years\u2014became known as the Kessler syndrome.\n\nWhile the scenario was accepted in theory by NASA officials, nothing much was done about it. Capturing and disposing of space junk would be expensive and difficult, and the threat was too far in the future to trigger much worry. After Kessler retired in 1996, he grew a trim gray beard, peered through his telescope on those clear nights, and waited. \u201cI knew something would happen eventually,\u201d he says.\n\nThen, on February 10, 2009\u2014just a little more than three decades after the publication of his paper\u2014the Kessler syndrome made its stunning debut. Some 500 miles over the Siberian tundra, two satellites were cruising through space, each racing along at about 5 miles per second. Iridium 33 was flying north, relaying phone conversations. A long-retired Russian communication outpost called Cosmos 2251 was tumbling east in an uncontrolled orbit. Then they collided. The ferocious impact smashed the satellites into roughly 2,100 pieces. Repercussions on the ground were minimal\u2014perhaps a few dropped calls\u2014but up in the sky, the consequences were serious. The wreckage quickly expanded into a cloud of debris, each shard an orbiting cannonball capable of destroying yet another hunk of high-priced hardware.\n\nAs Kessler received reports of the collision from former colleagues at NASA, he realized that the situation had played out pretty much as he\u2019d foreseen. After all, he had forecast that the first satellite collision would happen around this time between objects of roughly this mass. Like an opening shot in a war, the crash served as a signal that the syndrome had gone from theory to reality. \u201cSome people weren\u2019t aware how fast these objects are going,\u201d he says. \u201cAt those speeds, even something quite small can create tremendous damage.\u201d\n\nAlmost immediately after the accident, a military unit called the Space Surveillance Network sprang into action. Run by the Joint Space Operations Center at California\u2019s Vandenberg Air Force Base, the network uses a system of radar installations and optical sensors to monitor space junk. Before the Iridium-Cosmos incident, it had been tracking 120 active satellites and worrying about an average of five potential collisions, or \u201cconjunctions,\u201d per day. The crash took everyone by surprise. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even on their list of possibilities that day,\u201d an Iridium spokesperson says.\n\nThe operations center moved quickly to double its computer capacity. By early 2010, it was keeping a close eye on 1,000 active satellites, 3,700 inactive satellites and rocket pieces, and another 15,300 objects the size of a fist or larger\u2014a level of awareness that revealed a much higher daily average of 75 possible collisions. And that\u2019s ignoring the danger posed by the estimated half-million smaller pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger. Too small to track from the ground, each of those tiny projectiles is capable of severely damaging a satellite.\n\nJust a month after the Iridium accident, a stray motor chunk hurtled toward the International Space Station. Cruising at an altitude of 220 miles, astronauts aboard the $100 billion laboratory were going about their daily chores at around noon EDT when they received a warning\u2014prepare for possible impact. The crew was directed to scramble into the station\u2019s equivalent of a lifeboat, an attached Russian-made Soyuz capsule. It would give them a chance to abandon ship, if necessary. After a few minutes, the motor zipped by, missing the ISS by just a few miles\u2014in space terms, a close call.\n\nThen on December 1, with almost no warning, a small chunk from a different Cosmos satellite hurtled toward the ISS, coming within a mile of a direct hit. Due to its speeding-bullet velocity, even this fragment could have had an impact equal to a truck bomb. \u201cA 10-centimeter sphere of aluminum would be like 7 kilograms of TNT,\u201d says Jack Bacon, a senior NASA scientist charged with keeping the ISS safe. \u201cIt would blow everything to smithereens.\u201d\n\nIncidents like these served as clear signs from above that something must finally be done about space junk. Its proliferation threatens not only current and future space missions but also global communications\u2014mobile phone networks, satellite television, radio broadcasts, weather tracking, and military surveillance, even the dashboard GPS devices that keep us from getting lost. The number of manufactured objects cluttering the sky is now expected to double every few years as large objects weaken and split apart and new collisions create more Kesslerian debris, leading to yet more collisions.\n\nNASA\u2019s Bacon puts it bluntly: \u201cThe Kessler syndrome is in effect. We\u2019re in a runaway environment, and we won\u2019t be able to use space in the future if we don\u2019t start dealing with this now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA Brief History of Space Junk\n\nThe Telstar 1 satellite relays the first phone calls and TV signals across the Atlantic. It fails the next year. It\u2019s still out there. A Gemini 4 astronaut loses a glove on the first US spacewalk. It burns up in the atmosphere a month later. Skylab\u2019s reentry rattles windows and drops fragments onto the outback in western Australia. The number of cataloged orbiting debris objects (over 10 centimeters in diameter) reaches nearly 6,500. A fuel tank from a Delta II rocket smashes into a yard near Georgetown, Texas. Fortunately, no one is injured. A titanium motor casing from a Delta II rocket crashes into the Saudi Arabian desert.\n\nThe number of cataloged debris objects in orbit tops 10,000. A Chinese test weapon shoots down the Fengyun-1C satellite, creating some 3,000 new pieces of trackable space junk. Pixar\u2019s Wall-E depicts a thick belt of space waste circling Earth. The first satellite collision occurs. Cosmos 2251 hits Iridium 33, creating some 2,100 new pieces of debris. An object headed toward the International Space Station forces the crew to prepare for an emergency escape. The number of cataloged debris objects reaches 15,000.\n\nPhotos: Wall-E: Pixar; all others: NASA\n\nSince the dawn of the space age, NASA has operated under what it calls the big sky theory\u2014the notion that, given the vastness of space, it\u2019s perfectly fine to discard mission waste or abandoned rocket stages up there. After all, these objects would likely fall out of orbit and burn up as they reentered Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The only question was when. Some would take just a few years, while those in higher orbits might not descend for decades. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think twice about it,\u201d says former astronaut Bryan O\u2019Connor, now one of NASA\u2019s top safety officers. Russia and other nations have also been launching missions under the same assumption\u2014that even if a giant solar panel happened to fall off the back of a shuttle, you could simply wish it bon voyage.\n\nIn the midst of all this complacency, Kessler wasn\u2019t the only voice raising concerns about the big sky theory. Arthur C. Clarke, who in the 1940s conceived of communications satellites, wrote a 1979 novel, The Fountains of Paradise , in which all the space junk that had been accumulating \u201chad to be located, and somehow disposed of.\u201d He imagined what he dubbed Operation Cleanup: Space fortresses armed with high-powered lasers would sweep the skies, vaporizing the debris. If we didn\u2019t act, Clarke warned, Earth would be cut off from space and we\u2019d lose the ability to communicate by satellite and explore the heavens. \u201cWe would sink back into a dark age,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDuring the resultant chaos, disease and starvation would destroy much of the human race.\u201d\n\nTo stave off such a day, Kessler and his colleagues at the Orbital Debris Program Office developed some guidelines to slow the accumulation of space junk. The rules limited what could be abandoned, and they required satellite operators to help clean up the crowded geosynchronous belt 22,400 miles above Earth by maneuvering retired spacecraft into slightly higher \u201cgraveyard orbits\u201d out of harm\u2019s way. By 2008, similar guidelines had been adopted by most of the major space agencies around the world.\n\nThe new rules did slow the growth of space debris. And thanks to gravity, stuff continued to fall from the sky. Roughly once a day, an object in the official US catalog of debris drops out of orbit and turns to ash on reentry. Once a week or so, an object that\u2019s too big or dense will survive reentry and plunge to Earth, but it typically plops down unnoticed in an ocean or some unpopulated expanse. (There are exceptions: An upper rocket stage once landed in the desert of Saudi Arabia, to the surprise of local shepherds, and in 1997, a steel fuel tank slammed into a yard in Texas.)\n\nYet much of the progress from the international effort was undone in a single moment. On January 11, 2007, the Chinese government staged a demonstration of its military might by firing a projectile at one of its own retired satellites, the Fengyun-1C, in low Earth orbit. The \u201ckinetic kill vehicle\u201d scored a bull\u2019s-eye, blasting the satellite into 3,000 trackable pieces. (Even though its space program is relatively young, China already accounts for 31 percent of all debris traceable to specific launches\u2014comparable to the shares of Russia and the US.) It wasn\u2019t long before the Chinese test started causing trouble. In May 2009, a roughly 4-inch fragment from the Fengyun explosion whizzed by space shuttle Atlantis , which at the time was in the vicinity of the Hubble Space Telescope on a repair mission. Had it struck either one, it could have done catastrophic damage.\n\nThe Chinese debris, combined with the Iridium-Cosmos collision, finally revealed the bankruptcy of the prevailing philosophy governing space. \u201cThe big sky theory is no longer a viable concept for space operations,\u201d says Chris Moss, chief of strategy for the military\u2019s Joint Space Operations Center. Officials at NASA now acknowledge that orbital debris is the biggest threat to the International Space Station. And the call for action is global, says Heiner Klinkrad, the top debris expert at the European Space Agency: \u201cDebris removal is the only cure to the Kessler syndrome.\u201d\n\nLast December, at a Marriott not far from Darpa\u2019s headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, about 175 people filed into a meeting hall to take part in the first-ever International Conference on Orbital Debris Removal, sponsored by Darpa and NASA. The gathering attracted a group of idealistic innovators, members of a self-proclaimed \u201cdebris community\u201d that no one knew existed in such numbers. \u201cThis reminds me of Boy Scouts, with their motto \u2018Leave no trace,'\u201d said Patrick Moran, an engineer with California-based Aerospace Corporation. \u201cThe same rigor must now be imposed on space.\u201d The three-day meeting featured an address by none other than Donald Kessler, the dean of space debris. The official purpose of the conference was an open \u201ccall for information,\u201d but in some respects it resembled an episode of American Idol , with rocket scientists as contestants\u2014and with Kessler, his old NASA colleagues, and Darpa officials serving as judges. Darpa had had only scant involvement with the debris issue, but the agency\u2019s director of tactical technology, David Neyland, kicked off the conference by noting that Darpa was created \u201cto look across different tech domains to prevent surprises, and orbital debris is a surprise\u201d\u2014one with national security consequences for US spy satellites.\n\nAs in the early rounds of a talent contest, many of the acts didn\u2019t seem quite ready for prime time. A librarian from a university about 90 miles from Roswell, New Mexico, proposed launching giant sticky space balls that would adhere to objects and drag them out of orbit. A grad student outlined his plan to attach sails to the space trash, gently floating the pieces earthward. One engineer from Colorado insisted that a giant inflatable doughnut would do the trick by bouncing rubbish down into the atmosphere.\n\nThen there were the inevitable laser-based approaches. A former Los Alamos National Lab scientist presented a long-standing plan involving a giant laser station on a Hawaiian peak. A professor from Alabama proposed zapping debris with lasers attached to satellites, causing the junk to plummet into the atmosphere.\n\nBut three of the plans seemed to hold real promise. The first came from 72-year-old Jerome Pearson, an engineer best known for imagining the space elevator concept in the 1970s. Pearson showed up with an animated demo that looked remarkably like the old Space Invaders videogame. Now president of South Carolina-based Star Technology and Research, he proposed a seven-year mission in which a dozen suitcase-sized spacecraft would piggyback on other launches. Every vehicle would hold 100 lightweight nets, each as big as a house. Onboard video cameras would allow ground crews to drape the nets over hunks of junk by remote control. The craft would drag the debris out of orbit, then return to search for more. Pearson claimed his system could capture 2,500 or so objects in the most crowded and dangerous bands of low Earth orbit. The estimated price tag: $240 million.\n\nThe second plan came from NASA\u2019s Bacon, who outlined a scheme to launch a 10-ton mother ship that would hold 10 additional tons of mass-produced nanosatellites, stored like larvae in a honeycombed nest. Once released, the nanosats would approach objects, toss lightweight nets over them, and then tow the debris into the atmosphere. Bacon\u2019s plan is suitable mainly for pieces of junk lighter than 2 pounds in low Earth orbit. Heavier items\u2014rocket stages, satellites\u2014would remain. He estimates that each launch of a mother ship would cost $100 million, with as many as 12 missions needed.\n\nThe third concept was from Rob Hoyt, CEO of Tethers Unlimited, a Seattle-area space contractor. For the past 15 years, Hoyt has been developing a system called Rustler, to \u201cround up space trash [for] low Earth orbit remediation.\u201d He envisions midsize space vehicles\u2014400 pounds or so\u2014piggybacking on satellite launches. Once in orbit, such a craft would sidle up to junk and attach an electrodynamic tether\u2014a wire-mesh kite tail up to 6 miles long\u2014then send an amp of current through the material. The current would interact with Earth\u2019s magnetic field, producing a drag effect and lowering the debris into the atmosphere. Hoyt\u2019s approach drew praise from Kessler and others for its simplicity and relatively low price. According to Hoyt, a test mission to take out a few tons of trash could cost just tens of millions of dollars.\n\nWhich brings up the problem of how to pay for deploying any of these technologies. One idea would be to assess a fee on commercial satellite companies\u2014which would benefit, after all, from safer skies. Eventually, aerospace firms may equip their satellites with built-in disposal devices so they can be pulled out of orbit when their missions are complete. Hoyt has just such a product, called Terminator Tape, a 3-pound package containing a tether that can be unfurled automatically using the spacecraft\u2019s own electronics.\n\nBy the end of the conference, there was a sense that removing the junk is actually possible. \u201cI\u2019ve gone from being totally skeptical to thinking maybe something will work,\u201d Kessler says. \u201cWe can bring things down; it\u2019s just going to cost a lot.\u201d\n\nEric Christiansen knows just how damaging space junk can be. From his office at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, he directs a team that studies what happens when orbiting objects get whacked, slammed, pierced, and pummeled. His lab has a wonderfully badass name: the Hypervelocity Impact Technology Facility. The impacting actually happens a few hundred miles away, at NASA\u2019s testing range near White Sands, New Mexico. There, technicians operate a cannon that uses gunpowder and pressurized hydrogen to fire plastic slugs at shields and panels. Just like real space junk, the projectiles can approach speeds of 5 miles per second.\n\nChristiansen and his colleagues study the results and use their findings to help develop stronger materials and designs for spacecraft. They\u2019re also working on shields that might provide protection from stray projectiles. \u201cThis is the lightest shield that will stop a 2-centimeter projectile,\u201d he says, pointing to a multilayer Kevlar and ceramic panel for the ISS.\n\nSome of the mangled hardware is on display at the space center. The most treasured of these objects is a piece of window glass from a 1983 Challenger mission. Dinged by debris, it entered the collection when Kessler worked at NASA. \u201cDon gave this to me,\u201d Christiansen says, \u201cand he said, \u2018You protect this and leave it to the next guy.'\u201d\n\nChristiansen collaborates with the Orbital Debris Program Office, which does much of its work in a corrugated metal building. The office\u2014run by Kessler\u2019s successor, Nicholas L. Johnson\u2014is improving its ability to forecast crashes and spot some of the smallest space bits using a huge telescope on a Chilean mountaintop, which will be joined in 2011 by a new scope on a Pacific atoll.\n\nThis happens to be the day after the Obama administration announced it was canceling Constellation, NASA\u2019s grand plan to return astronauts to the moon by 2020. Along with the final phase-out of the Space Shuttle Program and the move to privatize launches, it all seems to represent a massive resetting of NASA\u2019s priorities. Perhaps that makes it the opportune time to get serious about tidying up the skies. The main obstacle, of course, is funding. But included in NASA\u2019s proposed 2011 budget is a first-ever provision to award $400,000 research grants for orbital debris removal and other projects. The allocation would be part of a new \u201cmission directorate\u201d called Space Technology, funded to the tune of almost $5 billion over the next five years. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping NASA will be able to take charge,\u201d Star Technology\u2019s Pearson says.\n\nFor Donald Kessler, now 70, that would be welcome news. Standing on his back porch, he doesn\u2019t need his telescope to spot the man-made spacecraft whizzing overhead. \u201cAnyone can see satellites with the naked eye,\u201d he says. \u201cSeveral pass by every hour.\u201d Sooner or later, he says, word will arrive that another one has been smashed and shattered, and the fragments will escalate the danger to all space missions. The man with the syndrome named after him will keep watch and wait for the next call.\n\nEvan I.
