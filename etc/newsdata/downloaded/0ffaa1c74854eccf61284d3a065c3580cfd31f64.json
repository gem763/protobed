Elton John will be here with his family. The house will accommodate John\u2019s husband, David Furnish, and their children Zachary and Elijah.\n\nMORE: Ex-Giant seals move to Melbourne with sale\n\nBomera in Potts Point sells for $34 million\n\nIt is understood the home is not Barford, which steel industrialist Sanjeev Gupta is renting at $30,000 a week from property \u00addeveloper Ian Joye, who is likely to move back in later this year.\n\nJohn\u2019s three-year Farewell Yellow Brick Road world tour kicked off in September last year, consisting of 300 shows across five continents. Some 48 years on from his debut Sydney show, it will be his biggest tour since 1986 which had 25 shows with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. John\u2019s preference for years was the now \u00addemolished Sebel in Elizabeth Bay then at the Park Hyatt.\n\nLuxury rental accommodation, while difficult to secure, has \u00adbecome de rigueur even for short celebrity stays. Justin Bieber \u00adbriefly stayed on Coronation Ave, Mosman in 2017. Adele had just checked out of the home, after \u00adreportedly paying $20,000 a week. Ricky Martin asked for ocean views and access to Fox \u00adStudios, when he was filming The Voice, so his homestay was \u00adBronte\u2019s Wave House. Boy George resided at Centennial Park\u2019s Lactura.\n\nI recall rentals of $16,000 a week in Mosman by Diana Ross on her 1989 tour. The agent to the stars Bill Bridges also sec\u00adured $25,000 a week when Paul McCartney stayed in 1993. These days bookings extend beyond the time the star is actually in residence because their entourage need to install hi-tech security and communications gear.", "description": "Elton John will call an exclusive suburb in Sydney\u2019s east home when he spends five months doing 34 concerts across Australia on his forthcoming tour.", "authors": ["Jonathan Chancellor"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16121041/capi_1ee70559f5fdf4ff68e9c19ac7203e62_7e9881ef389d7a39f6297c031872bfdf.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
