I just \u2014 I don\u2019t have the best face for HD, and whenever someone takes a candid photo of me on their phone it\u2019s never that exciting. The photos this camera takes are the perfect soft-focus, low-resolution images that don\u2019t ever need retouching. I\u2019ll buy them for parties \u2014 I had them at my book party last year, and then when my husband and I got married, we had done the legal ceremony beforehand but had a big party for our friends, and instead of spending money to hire a photographer we gave a ton of these cameras out to our guests and told them to take pictures all night long. The pictures are great.
