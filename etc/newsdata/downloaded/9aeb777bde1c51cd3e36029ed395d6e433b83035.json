The \u201cMorning Joe\u201d anchors have been reportedly on a home set in Jupiter, Fla., but using Washington, DC, backdrops. Sources said the reason for the locale was a \u201ctax dodge\u201d \u2014 albeit a completely legal one \u2014 since Scarborough has a home in Florida and would need to spend a certain amount of the time there for any tax benefit. \u2026Scarborough, who\u2019s still presently registered to vote in Connecticut., on Oct. 9, 2018 registered to vote in Palm Beach County, Fla. according to public records. \u2026By moving to Florida, he\u2019d reduce his tax burden by roughly $550,000. Scarborough reportedly makes $8 million a year and would pay 6.99-percent state income tax in Connecticut, while there\u2019s no state income tax in Florida, the Post\u2019s Josh Kosman reports. To qualify as a Florida resident, he\u2019d need to be there 183 days a year.\n\nAccording to the story, Scarborough and Brzezinski are only making the move to be close to aging parents.\n\nThat certainly may be part of the story, but I am 99.99 percent confident that they won\u2019t be filing another tax return with the Taxnut State\u2026oops, I mean Nutmeg State.\n\nMeanwhile, another billionaire is escaping from parasitic politicians in New York and moving to zero-income tax in Florida.\n\nBillionaire Carl Icahn is planning to move his home and business to Florida to avoid New York\u2019s higher taxes, according to people familiar with the matter. \u2026The move is scheduled for March 31 and employees who don\u2019t do so won\u2019t have a job\u2026 Hedge fund billionaires have relocated to Florida for tax reasons for years \u2014 David Tepper, Paul Tudor Jones and Eddie Lampert being among the most prominent. But Florida officials have been aggressively pushing Miami as a destination for money managers since the Republican-led tax overhaul. \u2026Florida is one of seven states without a personal income tax, while New York\u2019s top rate is 8.82%. Florida\u2019s corporate tax rate is 5.5%, compared with 6.5% in New York. Icahn\u2019s move was reported earlier by the New York Post. The difference could mean dramatic savings for Icahn, who is the world\u2019s 47th richest person.\n\nThese two stories are only anecdotes. And without comprehensive data, there\u2019s no way of knowing if they are part of a trend.\n\nThat\u2019s why the IRS website that reports the interstate movement of money is so useful (it\u2019s not often I give the IRS a compliment!). You can peruse data showing what states are losing income and what states are gaining income.\n\nThough if you want a user-friendly way of viewing the data, I strongly recommend How Money Walks. That website allows you to create maps showing the net change in income and where the income is coming from, or going to.\n\nSince our first story was about Connecticut, here\u2019s a map showing that the Nutmeg State has suffered a net exodus (red is bad) over the 1992-2016 period.\n\nIn other words, the state is suffering from fiscal decay.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a map for New York, where we see the same story.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the state that is reaping a windfall thanks to tax refugees.\n\nFlorida, to put it mildly, is kicking New York\u2019s derri\u00e8re (green is good).\n\nAnd you can see on the left side that Florida is also attracting lots of taxpayers from New Jersey, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.\n\nBy the way, some of my leftist friends claim this internal migration is driven by weather. I suspect that\u2019s a partial factor, but I always ask them why people (and their money) are also migrating out of California, where the weather is even better.\n\nP.S. Tax migration is part of tax competition, and it\u2019s a big reason why left-wing governments sometimes feel compelled to lower taxes.\n\nP.P.S. When the IRS releases data for 2017 and 2018, I\u2019m guessing we\u2019ll see even more people escaping to Florida, in large part because there\u2019s now a limit on deducting state and local taxes.\n\nP.P.P.S. I also cheer when people escape high-tax nations.", "description": "Like most libertarians, I\u2019m a bit quirky.Most people, if they .09/16/2019 19:10:27PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
