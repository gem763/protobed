It is also a problem in England, Italy and all around the world, these people should be banned for life. We need to stay together and fight against it because this is unacceptable.'\n\nBut Berbatov was also keen to stress that the sickening actions of individuals caught on camera abusing England's stars shouldn't be used to define the overall beliefs of his home country.\n\n'I cannot accept the criticism that the whole of Bulgaria has received, 50 people cannot define a nation, we are not racists,' he said. 'I am a proud Bulgarian and I know that we are dealing with this straight away, and there will be severe justice. I hope that every country around the world is working on this issue, we are all in this together, let\u2019s not divide.'\n\nFor more from Betfair Ambassador, Dimitar Berbatov, listen to Betfair\u2019s Football\u2026Only Bettor podcast at: https://betting.betfair.com/", "description": "Several of Gareth Southgate's men, including debutant Tyrone Mings, were subjected to disgusting chants from home supporters.", "authors": ["Daniel Davis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/21/19855460-0-image-a-6_1571343005977.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
