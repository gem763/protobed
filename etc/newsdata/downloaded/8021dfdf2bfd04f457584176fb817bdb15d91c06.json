It can be put in a service catalog or marketplace and deployed from there. But what\u2019s maybe most important, says Russinovich, is that the developer can hand off the specification to the ops team and the ops team can then deploy it without having to talk to the developer. He also argues that Kubernetes itself is too complicated for enterprise developers. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s really infrastructure-focused,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want a developer to focus on the app. What we saw when we talked to Kubernetes shops, they don\u2019t let developers near Kubernetes.\u201d\n\nAs for the cooperation with Alibaba Cloud on this specification, Russinovich noted that the two companies were already working on other projects together and that they both encountered the same problems when they talked to their customers and internal teams. Over time, they plan to bring the specification into an open-source foundation.\n\nAlibaba Cloud will launch a managed service based on OAM, and chances are that Microsoft will do the same over time. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to see what adoption looks like to decide,\u201d Russinovich said.\n\nWhile OAM solves an obvious problem for developers and ops team and fills a gap, Russinovich argues that Dapr may actually be quite revolutionary. \u201cIf you take a look at Dapr, it is really going to make microservices, cloud-native development, accessible to the enterprise.\u201d\n\nSo what is Dapr? Microsoft describes it as \u201copen source, portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, microservice stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a mouthful, but the general idea here is to make it easier for developers to write distributed, microservice-based applications. \u201cIf you take a look at the list of problems they run into, they want to be event-driven, so they have to manage things like events and responding to triggers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want communication between these microservices, so they\u2019ve got to do pub/sub. They\u2019ve got to do service discovery \u2014 how do I get a service from one microservice to another one. They\u2019ve got to do state management \u2014 how does my microservice store state and retrieve it.\u201d And then, depending on whether it\u2019s a stateless or stateful app, developers have to work with different SDKs and programming models. Dapr, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t need an SDK because it delivers its services through a local HTTP or gRPC endpoint, keeping the application code separate from the Dapr code. Because of this, Dapr is also independent of the language you write in.\n\nDapr abstracts a lot of this away and provides the building blocks (which can be accessed by HTTP or gRPC APIs) that encode best practices for building these distributed services.", "description": "Microsoft today announced two new open-source projects: Dapr, a portable, event-driven runtime that takes some of the complexity out of building microservices, and the Open Application Model (OAM), a specification that allows developers to define the resources their applications need to run on Kubernetes clusters and which Microsoft developed in cooperation with Alibaba Cloud.
