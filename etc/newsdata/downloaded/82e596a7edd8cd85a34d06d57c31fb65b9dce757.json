You\u2019re going to weather it.\u201d\n\nNo talk of being \u201cOK,\u201d no mention of \u201csleep.\u201d\n\nDamn right, pitching in the World Series is a storm. And Strasburg can stand up to rain, snow, sleet, hail and the Houston Astros lineup.\n\nThe Nationals postseason pitching legend weathered the storm Tuesday night with 8 1/3 innings of clutch pitching in a 7-2 win to give his team a Game 7 showdown Wednesday night at Minute Maid Park.\n\nWashington has the opportunity to win the franchise\u2019s first World Series and the first one in Washington since the 1924 Senators.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of stormy weather in D.C. since then.\n\nMax Scherzer, making a miraculous recovery from his neck and back spasms that prevented him from lifting his arm Sunday night, forcing him out of a Game 5 start, threw in left field before Tuesday night\u2019s Game 6 and left the field declaring himself ready for Game 7.\n\nNationals manager Dave Martinez confirmed that as of Tuesday night.\n\nThe Game 6 victory gave Strasburg, who struck out seven, a 5-0 record for this postseason. No one else in Major League Baseball playoff history has won five games without a defeat in a single postseason.\n\nHe has learned to weather those storms \u2014 and he had to do so early Tuesday night.\n\nAfter Washington took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on an RBI single by Anthony Rendon off Houston starter Justin Verlander, the Astros came back with a leadoff double by George Springer and a two-run home run by Alex Bregman to take a 2-1 lead.\n\nIt had rained all day in Houston, and in the first inning, it looked as if it was going to pour inside Minute Maid Park.\n\nBut Strasburg kept his composure and kept the Astros hitters off the board for the next seven innings.\n\nHis teammates picked him up when Adam Eaton and Juan Soto both blasted solo home runs in the fifth, and Rendon added a two-run shot in the seventh and a two-run double in the ninth for a 7-2 lead.\n\nIt might have been one more run in the seventh inning, but the umpiring crew appeared to blow a call on Trea Turner at first base, claiming he interfered with Houston first baseman Yuri Gurriel when his glove came off as Turner crossed the base safely.\n\nThe bad call set off Martinez, who was tossed after his coaches had to hold him back from going after the umpires.\n\nStrasburg remained calm.\n\nHe came out for the bottom of the seventh and retired the Houston side in order over the next two innings \u2014 including Springer, Jose Altuve, Michael Brantley and Bregman.\n\nBefore this win-or-go-home start, Strasburg was asked what he expected.\n\n\u201cI know what I expect of myself,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold true to that. That\u2019s all I can really control. My approach is everything and how I respond to whatever happens once the ball leaves my hand is just as important.\u201d\n\nHe was speaking a time in his career when he would be upset when things didn\u2019t go quite right once the ball left his hand. He would be consumed by the storm.\n\nNo longer.\n\nWhen the ball left his hand in the first inning and landed in the left field seats after Bregman\u2019s blast, Strasburg stood up to the storm. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve come to expect from him. He is the lighthouse.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
