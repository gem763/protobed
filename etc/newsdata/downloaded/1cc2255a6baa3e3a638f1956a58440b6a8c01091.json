But an ability to excel on the field despite those injuries \u2013 earning lucrative contracts and endorsement deals in the process \u2013 provided both players with the ability to retire on their terms.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got money security, which is important \u2013 I don\u2019t care what you say, it\u2019s very important,\u201d said Bradshaw, who spoke to FOX Business on behalf of Pfizer\u2019s \u201cAll About Your Boom\u201d campaign. \u201cTwo, they\u2019ve had a great deal of success. And then three, injury does drive you into retirement. You get tired of fighting, fighting and fighting, rehab, rehab, injury, rehab.\u201d\n\nAside from their on-field accomplishments, Luck and Gronkowski were considered among the NFL\u2019s most savvy businessmen. Luck earned nearly $110 million in salary during his career, plus endorsements with Nike and DirecTV and an equity stake in sports drink brand BodyArmor.\n\nA three-time Super Bowl champion, Gronkowski is known for having saved all of the more than $53 million he earned in salary during his nine seasons in the NFL. Instead of burning through his pay, Gronkowski relied on proceeds from a bevy of sponsorship deals. In retirement, he recently became the face of Abacus Health\u2019s CBDMedic brand and announced plans to become an advocate for use of CBD as a pain reliever for professional athletes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBradshaw, who transitioned from the NFL to a career in acting and television work for FOX NFL Sunday, noted that his own retirement from football was motivated by his battles with constant injuries.\n\n\u201cWhen you make the decision that they\u2019ve made, you can rest assured of one thing \u2013 it is something well thought-out and it is something that they\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d Bradshaw said. \u201cOur coaches all tell us, you have to plan your life after football, you\u2019ve got to get on with your life\u2019s work. You know what? You really do. I applaud both of these young men for making the decision, because they\u2019re both under 30 and at the peak of their careers.\u201d\n\nFILE -- New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski (87) makes a 15-yard reception on third and 10 with 11:57 left in overtime of the AFC Championship Game game between the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs on January 20, 2019 at Arrowhea Expand\n\nInjuries are among the biggest risks to the financial security of NFL players, many of whom do not have the luxury of guaranteed money in their contracts. An ill-timed hit that saps on-field production or takes a player off the field entirely can have an immediate impact on a player\u2019s earning potential.\n\nThe game\u2019s physical nature is also one of the main reasons players and their union representatives have long resisted the idea of a longer NFL season \u2013 even if it would more money in their pockets. While owners are widely expected to push for an 18-game season during labor talks in the coming months, Bradshaw said he believes an expanded campaign is unlikely.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to sit well with the players\u2019 association, and if it does, you\u2019re going to have to open up the 53-man roster and make it a 73-man roster, which means they\u2019re going to spend more money, and you know the owners don\u2019t want to spend more money. They want to keep things the way they are so they can make more money,\u201d Bradshaw said.", "description": "Gronkowski and Luck each cited mental exhaustion and painful injuries as key factors in their decision to step away from football at the relatively young age of 30.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Terry-Bradshaw-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
