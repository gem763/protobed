'That purpose may be as simple as providing joy or it may be helping in the field of equity or amplifying other people's voices. But my metric for success is having an impact on something greater than myself.'\n\nA-list favorite: Yara's drive has clearly made an impact, with the likes of Kerry Washington, Oprah Winfrey, and Michelle Obama all counted as fans\n\nYara's drive has clearly made an impact, with the likes of Kerry Washington, Oprah Winfrey, and Michelle Obama all counted as fans.\n\nOprah endorsed her for president one day, while Michelle wrote her a college recommendation letter.\n\n'She doesn't allow her youth to be a limitation,' Kerry told Glamour. The pair worked together on an episode of Scandal, which saw Yara play a young Olivia Pope.\n\n'We constantly educate one another': Yara is inspired to continue her line of work by other young people with similar goals (pictured Auckland, New Zealand October 2019)\n\n'She sees that the unique perspective her age provides her doesn't mean she should say less. It means she should say more. That's the sign of a true leader.'\n\nYara realized just how much her voice did actually matter after appearing at the 2015 NAACP panel on Hollywood diversity.\n\n'That panel was really pivotal for me because I realized I could not only be a leader in conversation, but I could be one of the voices representing things that are near and dear to my heart.'\n\nYara is inspired to continue her line of work by other young people with similar goals.\n\n'I don't think I'd be doing the work I'm doing if I wasn't constantly inspired by the other young people doing this work, by the other young people doing work I didn't even realize had to be done,' she said. 'I feel like we constantly educate one another. Because we inherited a world in crisis, we enter this world inspired to make change.'\n\nThe Glamour Women Of The Year Awards recognizes a number of accomplished women making waves in their industries, making Yara a perfect selection.\n\nShe will be recognized this year alongside fellow honorees Margaret Atwood, Charlize Theron, Greta Thunberg, Ava DuVernay, Megan Rapinoe, Tory Burch, and the Women Of RAICES.\n\nIt's an honor: Margaret Atwood is among this year's Glamour Women Of The Year honorees", "description": "In the issue, the 19-year-old shared her hopes, fears, and passions for making the world a better place.
