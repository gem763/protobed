And Kayla Mueller who was working as a humanitarian, great young American, idealistic, young girl,\u201d said O\u2019Brien.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that General [Mark A.] Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, did was name the operation that took down al-Baghdadi after Kayla Mueller, after what she had suffered. And that was something that people should know,\u201d he said.\n\nMueller, a native of Prescott, Arizona, was kidnapped while doing humanitarian work in Syria in 2013. She was 26 years old when she was killed in 2015.\n\nMueller was traveling in the company of Syrian contractors for Doctors Without Borders (widely known as MSF, the acronym for its name in French), on the way back to Turkey after installing communications equipment at a hospital, when she was stopped on the road by a group of armed ISIS fighters. The others taken prisoner with Mueller were released over the next few weeks, but ISIS accused her of being a spy and kept her captive in various locations until her death.\n\nThere was some controversy early in Mueller\u2019s ordeal when her family accused MSF of withholding an email address provided by her captors to begin negotiations for recovering her. MSF said it was unaware she accompanied its employees to Syria and would not have approved of her trip due to the high risk of kidnapping. MSF apologized and admitted it deliberately withheld the email address from Mueller\u2019s family because it feared they could have endangered other hostages if they directly communicated with the Islamic State.\n\nThe Syrian MSF contractor Mueller was traveling with reportedly attempted to rescue her by approaching Islamic State representatives and claiming to be her husband, but Mueller refused to go along with the ploy because she had already told her captors she was unmarried and she feared they would kill her for lying to them.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a fabulous organization. They do wonderful work, but somewhere in a boardroom they decided to leave our daughter there to be tortured and raped,\u201d Mueller\u2019s father Carl said of MSF in 2016.\n\nMueller was held for a time by Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf and his wife Umm Sayyaf. Abu Sayyaf was killed in a 2015 raid, while Umm Sayyaf (real name Nasrin As\u2019ad Ibrahim) was taken alive and charged by the FBI with imprisoning and torturing Mueller. According to the FBI affidavit, Mueller was personally raped by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi while in the Sayyafs\u2019 custody.\n\nBaghdadi referred to Mueller on various occasions as his \u201cproperty\u201d and his \u201cwife.\u201d\n\nUmm Sayyaf told American and Kurdish intelligence officials that Baghdadi personally took Mueller in a car with him to Raqqa, Syria, in late 2014. Mueller was killed in Raqqa a few months later.\n\n\u201cShe was a lovely girl and I liked her. She was very respectful and I respected her. One thing I would say is she was very good at hiding her sadness and pain,\u201d Umm Sayyaf said of Mueller in a June 2019 interview.\n\nMueller also spent some time in the hands of the four British ISIS recruits known as \u201cThe Beatles.\u201d Their leader, Mohammed \u201cJihadi John\u201d Emwadi, frequently paraded Mueller in front of other prisoners.\n\nAccording to other prisoners, Mueller was forced to wear an Islamic headscarf, but refused repeated demands to renounce her Christian faith and become a Muslim. She was known to directly contradict Jihadi John\u2019s claims that she had converted in front of other prisoners.\n\nThose other prisoners described Mueller as a woman of remarkable courage and willpower, as she resisted constant torture, sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, sexual assault, and slave labor. According to a Yazidi sex slave who was held along with Mueller by Abu and Umm Sayyaf, ISIS fighters tore Mueller\u2019s fingernails out during the early days of her captivity. Mueller nevertheless risked the wrath of her captors on numerous occasions to help other prisoners.\n\nFrida Saide, a female employee of MSF who spent some time imprisoned alongside Mueller at an abandoned oil refinery in Syria, described her as a \u201cvery good friend\u201d who had \u201ca strong faith that gave her a lot of strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was always considerate of others, even though she herself was in a very difficult situation. She was always concerned for other prisoners. She never stopped being concerned for the Syrian population living through just horrible things in this war and still are. She never stopped caring for others,\u201d Saide said.\n\nMueller wrote a letter to her family in the spring of 2014 in which she apologized for the suffering she had put them all through and spoke of the importance of her faith.\n\n\u201cI remember Mom always telling me that all in all, in the end the only one you really have is God,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI have come to a place in experience where, in every sense of the word, I have surrendered myself to our Creator because literally there was no one else. By God, and by your prayers, I have felt tenderly cradled in freefall.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pray each day that if nothing else, you have felt a certain closeness and surrender to God as well, and have formed a bond of love and support amongst one another,\u201d Mueller wrote to her family.\n\nMueller\u2019s family was extremely critical of how the Obama administration handled their daughter\u2019s captivity. \u201cThe president could have been a hero, but he chose not to,\u201d Carl Mueller said of Barack Obama in 2016 when criticizing the former president for failing to make a promised charity donation in Kayla Mueller\u2019s name.\n\nThe Muellers said the Obama White House threatened them with criminal prosecution when they attempted to negotiate a ransom with ISIS, a policy Obama later admitted was \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe Mueller family said Obama \u201cmade the whole situation worse\u201d by arranging a famously lopsided prisoner swap to secure the release of American deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from the Afghan Taliban because the deal inspired ISIS to increase its demands for releasing its own hostages. Carl Mueller said Obama\u2019s eagerness to recover Bergdahl while refusing to allow a ransom to be paid for Kayla was \u201cpretty hard to take.\u201d\n\nObama was also criticized for delaying too long after receiving information about the location of Mueller and two other American hostages, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, before authorizing a rescue mission. When the mission was finally conducted almost a month later, the prisoners had been moved. Foley and Sotloff were later murdered by ISIS.\n\nKayla Mueller was killed in the city of Raqqa, the Syrian capital of the ISIS \u201ccaliphate,\u201d in February 2015. The Islamic State claimed she was killed when Jordanian airstrikes caused the building she was held in to collapse, but the Jordanians strongly disputed these claims.\n\nJordan was attacking ISIS with particular ferocity at the time due to the hideous videotaped murder of captive pilot Mu\u2019ath al-Kaseasbeh, who was burned alive in a cage. President Trump referenced this murder in his address on Sunday morning announcing the death of Baghdadi, saying, \u201cThe shocking publicized murder of a Jordanian pilot who was burned alive in a cage for all to see.\u201d", "description": "Kayla Mueller was an American humanitarian volunteer kidnapped, tortured, raped, and murdered by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his Islamic State.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/ht_kayla_prooflife_grab_lf_160818_16x9_992-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
