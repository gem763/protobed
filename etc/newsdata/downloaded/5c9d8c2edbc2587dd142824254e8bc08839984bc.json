The Senate was supposed to come back. Why don\u2019t you all get that straight? The Senate did not come back to pass the bill.\u201d\n\nCheck out the video here:\n\nPressed on congressional response on gun violence, Speaker Pelosi says, \"Senator McConnell hasn't acted. Why don't you go ask him if he has any regrets for all the people who died because he hasn't acted?\" https://t.co/ndjoxepLtZ pic.twitter.com/xuwverLvdX \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 12, 2019\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act in February. McConnell, however, is yet to bring the legislation to the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting very angry about the silliness of these questions,\u201d Pelosi continued. \u201cLives are at stake. Senator McConnell is standing in the way. We passed our bill in February. Members had events all over the country to ask him to bring up the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me what we haven\u2019t done. We have done it,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you are annoyed with my impatience, it\u2019s because people are dying because Senator McConnell hasn\u2019t acted. Why don\u2019t you go ask him if he has any regrets for all the people who died because he hasn\u2019t acted?\u201d\n\nKopan later tweeted it was \u201cthe angriest\u201d she\u2019d seen Pelosi.\n\nAsked Pelosi about not bringing the House back in August to work on guns and she was maybe the angriest I\u2019ve seen her:\n\n\"Don\u2019t ask me what we haven\u2019t done, we have done it\u2026Sen. McConnell hasn\u2019t acted, why don\u2019t you go ask him if he has any regrets for all the people who died.\u201d \u2014 Tal Kopan (@TalKopan) September 10, 2019", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m getting very angry about the silliness of these questions,\" the House Speaker fired back in a video that's now going viral.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7a1169230000100551be25.jpeg?cache=0lswvejmon&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
