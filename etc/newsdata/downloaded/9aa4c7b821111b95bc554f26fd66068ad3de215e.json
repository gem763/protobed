A complicated new trick discovered for San Andreas has shortened a run that normally took almost four hours to under 30 minutes.\n\nThe new trick \u2014 whose name, \u201cArbitrary Jump In Skip,\u201d could honestly use some work \u2014 is only doable on the Windows Store version of the game. It\u2019s similar to a technique used by Grand Theft Auto: Vice City speedrunners, and it allows players to skip straight to San Andreas\u2019 climax via several intricate steps.\n\nAccording to details shared by current world record holder Powdinet over on Reddit, starting a vigilante side mission at a certain point during the early \u201cRyder\u201d story mission makes San Andreas jump to a random line of script code that\u2019s determined by how much time has elapsed since the game started.\n\nNaturally, things must line up just right to pull this off, which can be a difficult feat in the living world of San Andreas. Can\u2019t find a police motorcycle to start the vigilante mission within a strict time frame? Reset and try again. Can\u2019t find a drug dealer to waste for an extra $2,000?\n\nThat changes some of the steps further down the line. At one point, the convoluted setup causes San Andreas protagonist Carl Johnson to lose the ability to enter vehicles. But time everything right, and it\u2019s possible to make the game think you\u2019re on the final segment of the final mission. From there all runners have to do is complete the story as normal.\n\nSince this discovery was made public last Saturday, the fastest time in which folks have been able to complete San Andreas has been reduced dramatically. The enormous potential of this technique has caused the community to separate runs that utilise the Arbitrary Jump In Skip from those that don\u2019t. The current world record without using this trick stands at 3:52:07, whereas Powdinet recently managed to beat San Andreas in just 25:52.\n\nOver the years, speedrunners have been responsible for some of the coolest discoveries in video games, and this San Andreas trick is just another example of their ingenuity. Expect to see a lot more runs of San Andreas pop up as folks try to push the time even lower.", "description": "Grand Theft Auto games are huge, which makes speedrunning them a time-consuming proposition.
