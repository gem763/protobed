The deal appeared to be a bonanza for South American farm products, while French farmers feared it would swamp them with cheap imports, particularly beef and poultry.\n\nBrazil\u2019s economic policymakers hailed it as a milestone in opening their closed economy, claiming it will have a total economic impact of $87.5 billion in Brazil through 2035. Fern\u00e1ndez, for his part, has expressed skepticism of deal.\n\nPartly as a result of Mercosur, the nations are also heavily reliant on one another for trade and political friction could complicate the growth of job-creating trade and investment.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez will begin his four-year term in December and Bolsonaro\u2019s first term finishes in December 2022, meaning they will simultaneously hold office for at least three years.\n\nOliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university in Sao Paulo, said open hostility between the two reflects them playing to radical wings of their respective alliances to ensure domestic support. That strategy will make it difficult for pragmatists on either side of the border to defuse the imbroglio, notwithstanding their economic interdependence.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have a personal, workable relationship, anything can become a fire. When there\u2019s no trust on top, it\u2019s hard to put out fires. There will be disagreements,\u201d Stuenkel said by phone. \u201cThere are doubts about whether Fern\u00e1ndez and Bolsonaro will be on talking terms.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro didn\u2019t call to congratulate; these are petty, small politics and the real big questions that the region faces aren\u2019t being discussed or addressed.\u201d\n\nSouth America in recent years saw a surge of center-left leaders known as the Pink Tide retreat, which was mistakenly interpreted at the time as right-wing politicians regaining ground, according to Christopher Garman, Eurasia Group\u2019s managing director for the Americas. In fact, the shift represented widespread dissatisfaction with the overall status quo, further evidenced in recent weeks by massive street protests in Ecuador and Chile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that voters went right; they just kicked out incumbents. And they remain angry. It wasn\u2019t a policy and ideological move when it came to voter demands,\u201d Garman said. \u201cThat difficult public opinion environment remains, and there is variable capacity of governments to be able to navigate this. It\u2019s the underbelly of difficult middle-class politics across the region.\u201d\n\nCountries\u2019 positions toward Venezuela\u2019s socialist government also divide the region. Venezuela is in the throes of catastrophic depression that\u2019s prompted food and medicine shortages, plus the exodus of millions.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez\u2019s party was long allied with Venezuela\u2019s leaders and he is widely expected to withdraw from the Lima Group, which includes Brazil, that doesn\u2019t recognize the legitimacy of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nBolsonaro in August warned a prospective Fern\u00e1ndez government would resemble that of Maduro, and referred to him and his running-mate, former President Cristina Kirchner, as \u201cred bandits.\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s foreign minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo said on Twitter on Monday that Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s win sends \u201cthe worst possible signals. Trade closure, a retrograde economic model and support for dictatorships.\u201d He added Brazil will be pragmatic in its defense of the country\u2019s principles and interests.\n\nArgentina and Brazil falling out would have broader implications, as it\u2019s impossible to have real debate about South American integration or face up to regional challenges if they aren\u2019t on the same page, Stuenkel said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly the most unpredictable period since democratization in the late 1980s. Starting then, there was consensus that more cooperation was better, and that\u2019s no longer the case,\u201d he said.", "description": "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 A center-leftist's victory in Argentine presidential elections is set to cement a rift between South America's largest nations, and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/28/21ef6f_emirates-brazil-president-90486-jair-bolsonaro-in-photo-released-by-emirates-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
