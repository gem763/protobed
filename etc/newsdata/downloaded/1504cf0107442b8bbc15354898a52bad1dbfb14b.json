It wasn\u2019t how we drew it up, I know that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said again. \u201cThat thing just kept rolling and we couldn\u2019t stop it.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 13 total runs matched their total in the first four games of the best-of-five NL Division Series.\n\nThe Braves endured their 10th straight playoff series defeat while the Cardinals wrapped up a 3-2 series win to reach the NLCS for the first time since 2014.\n\nSt. Louis will face either the Los Angeles Dodgers or Washington Nationals for a place in the World Series.\n\n\u201cWe know we can beat anyone at this point,\u201d Wong said.\n\nThe Dodgers, trying to get back to the World Series for a third straight year, hosted the Nats in game five of their series later Wednesday.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 The St. Louis Cardinals exploded for 10 runs in the biggest first inning in Major League Baseball playoff history on Wednesday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/c24778_st-louis-cardinals-celebrate-13-win-atlanta-braves-in-game-major-league-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
