The president comparing the inquiry against him to a racist and painful chapter in American history tweeting, take a look, all Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here, a lynching, now some of his Republican allies quick to denounce the language but others defended it. Take a listen. This is a lynching in every sense. This is un-american. I think lynching is being seen as somebody taking the law in their own hands and out to get somebody for no good reason. Okay, so let's bring in Terry Moran there at the white house. Terry, this was yet remarkable moment in this presidency. Reporter: It sure was, Cecilia. The president has used a lot of incendiary language to express his fury at the impeachment inquiry but for millions of Americans this crossed a line. The history of lynching in this country is the history of pain and terror and racist tyranny, thousands of black Americans were murdered this way so for the president to use this term to compare a congressional investigation to a lynching, it was a rhetorical firebomb. One he deliberately detonated for political purposes and as you say, even for some of his Republican allies, it was too senate majority leader Mitch Mcconnell of Kentucky said that given the history of our country he would not have used this term. Now, the president's defenders were very quick to point out that some Democrats including Joe Biden used this term to describe the impeachment of bill Clinton. Biden's defenders say neither he nor the other Democrats have the same incendiary issue around racial issues that this president does. One more headline before we let you go. That senior -- that anonymous senior official who penned the op-ed claiming to be part of the resistance inside the administration now has a book coming out. Reporter: That's right. It's got Washington buzzing. It's called \"A warning.\" A senior trump administration official is the author. In that original \"The New York Times\" article he painted a devastating portrait of president trump saying that he was erratic, making half baked and reckless decisions. This is exactly the kind of thing that just infuriates the president. He clearly does not have the loyalty of everyone around him.
