It\u2019s also the production version of the prototype we drove a couple of months ago in Norway\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nWell, for one thing the MX-30 breaks from the EV orthodoxy that says the cure for range anxiety is bigger batteries. In its current guise, its 355-volt battery tops out at 35.5 kWh, which, though Mazda has not released final figures, should be good for 200 kilometres or so of all-electric motoring. That should be more than enough for most people\u2019s daily commutes, even those commuting into large urban centres from suburban outreaches.\n\nBut instead of offering bigger batteries for those looking for inter city travel, Mazda is adding a range-extending, gasoline-fed engine so that the current lack of a recharging infrastructure. And not just any range extender, but a rotary engine \u2014 the likes last seen in the company\u2019s RX-8 sports coupe. Not only is the Wankel engine more compact, affording the MX-30 generous cabin space, but held at a constant rpm (as generators are wont to do) rotaries can prove quite frugal. In other words, the MX-30 looks to be the EV the world needs \u2014 enough electric range to motor daily without emissions and a convenient range extender for long-distance motoring \u2014 if not the EV it desires.\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\n2020 Mazda MX-30 EV Handout , Mazda\n\nAnother takeaway from the RX-8 is the MX-30\u2019s rear \u2018suicide\u2019 doors \u2014 Mazda calls them freestyle \u2014 that open from the rear. Like the RX-8\u2019s, they are smaller than traditional rear doors but open a ingress/egress-aiding 80 degrees. Looks wise, Mazda says the MX-30 shows off its new \u201cHuman Modern\u201d design. What they really mean is that it\u2019s a slightly European take on the classic sport-cute. For those looking for current offering to judge the MX-30 against, the new Mazda is about the same size as Kia\u2019s Niro.\n\nInside, the cabin is perhaps \u2014 that should be read easily \u2014 the best yet crafted by Mazda. Pretty much all the controls \u2014 even the air conditioning system \u2014 are now touchscreen controlled, the dashboard is ultra \u201cclean\u201d with barely a switch of button to interrupt its horizontal flow, and Mazda has trotted out some Heritage Cork trim to highlight the MX-30\u2019s greenness.\n\nWhen is it coming?\n\n\n\nWe will be getting the MX-30 in the second half of 2020, and pointing out the importance of Canada to Mazda and its EV aspirations \u2014 I suspect the former should be read avoiding penalties from Quebec\u2019s ZEV mandate \u2014 we will be one of the first three markets to receive MX-30s.\n\nCheck out all of our latest auto show coverage\n\nShould you buy it?\n\nWell, that depends on how pretentious and gullible you are. If you fall for the Elon Musk logic that anything short of a pure EV is climate change denial and that one needs at least 500 kilometres of range to be considered a real EV, then I don\u2019t think the MX-30 is for you.\n\nBut if you\u2019re looking for a pragmatic solution to the automobile\u2019s future, the MX-30 \u2014 with its rotary range extender \u2014 will let you cut 80 per cent of your greenhouse gas emissions (and your monthly gasoline bill) while having the combined convenience of charging at home and gassing up quickly on the highway.
