My colleague is Kurdish and that's fine. But the PKK is something else,\" she added.\n\nIn a similar show of backing for the military action, at least five German regional football teams face disciplinary action after their players imitated the military salute performed by the Turkish national team during matches earlier this month.\n\nSuch gestures lead to \"daily consequences for Kurds, in the streets, when they are protesting, in their work places and definitely in the schools where they are victims of discrimination by Turkish children,\" charged Rohat Geran of a Kurdish umbrella federation.\n\nKurds in Germany have also accused DITIB mosques in the country of pushing Ankara's views on the sidelines of prayers.\n\nBut the powerful Turkish religious organisation rejected the charges, telling AFP that it has never championed such messages.\n\nSome caught in between are just hoping that latest conflict will soon blow over.\n\n\"I only go back (to Turkey) once a year... we live well here. So let them sit down at the same table and find a solution, and let us live peacefully in Germany,\" pleaded Cezal Vedat, 43, who runs a travel agency specialising in holidays to Turkey.", "description": "Syrian Kurd Mohamed Zidik, 76, still buys his bread and baclavas from his Turkish neighbours in Berlin, but he knows better than to expound on his views about Ankara's offensive in his hometown.
