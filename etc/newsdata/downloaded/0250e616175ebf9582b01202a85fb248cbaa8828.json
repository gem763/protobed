In 2006, he was waiting for a ride home outside a U.S. base.\n\n\"A car stopped right away, took out the pistol and start shooting me,\" Baidhani recalls, \"I [couldn't] feel anything after that.\"\n\nBaidhani survived, recovered and went back to work with U.S. forces.\n\n\"I want ... good communications between U.S. military and Iraqi civilians over there,\" he said.\n\nHis uncle also volunteered. So did his brother Wisam, who worked with Peter Farley, a former Army sergeant from Massachusetts.\n\n\"I couldn't imagine in a million years that I'd go over there and come back with one of my best friends being an Iraqi national,\" Farley told NPR.\n\nIn light of the sacrifice made by Iraqis and Afghans who assisted U.S. forces, Congress created the Special Immigrant Visa Program to get them and their families to safety in the U.S. Farley says it was about gratitude and also an incentive for local nationals to help U.S. troops. Now veterans such as Farley, as well as dozens of lawmakers, say they're afraid the promise they made is being broken. Under the Trump administration, the number coming to the U.S. has dropped drastically.\n\n\"This administration is hostile to refugees,\" says Adam Bates, with the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nBates says in Iraq there is a backlog of more than 100,000 people now in the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program P-2 Direct Access Program. Last year about 200 were cleared \u2014 down from nearly 10,000 in 2016.\n\nThe number of Afghans getting visas also is slowing \u2014 down about 60% in recent years, Bates says. More than 4,000 were cleared in fiscal year 2017, compared with about 1,650 in 2018.\n\n\"It would be impossible to say that these substantial drops are not a part of some policy. These are people who put themselves at risk because they served with U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" he says.\n\nA U.S. State Department official told NPR that it is working closely with U.S government partners to accelerate the visa processing, while maintaining national security as a highest priority. In response to a bipartisan letter from Congress, the Department of Homeland Security said it was aiming to speed up the visas after recent changes in the program, also with security as an overarching concern.\n\nNone of that makes sense to Farley, who says that if the Baidhanis were a threat to Americans, they could have killed him any number of times in Iraq.\n\n\"I mean, this family has sacrificed more than most American families,\" Farley says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Peter Farley/NPR Courtesy of Peter Farley/NPR\n\nHe lobbied the U.S. government to get both Baidhani and his brother Wisam to the U.S. in 2011. They've been living and working here ever since. But the program came too late for Khalid's uncle \u2014 gunmen killed him in 2008, on his way home from an American base.\n\nBaidhani's father and younger siblings also qualified for visas, but they're stuck in Baghdad.\n\n\"We worry about this family every day,\" Farley says. Wisam declined to be interviewed, he says because he has become depressed.\n\n\"It's hard to keep hope with the way things have gone,\" Farley says.\n\nThe way things have gone is that the family is still in Baghdad. After years of waiting and red tape, Baidhani's father, stepmother and three younger siblings were granted U.S. visas in 2016. They sold their family home in Baghdad, and all their other assets, and packed their bags. The day before their flight, they got a call that the visas had been put on hold pending yet another security check.\n\n\"I was shocked. It was like someone shot me with a bullet. I collapsed,\" Mohammad, Khalid and Wisam's father, told NPR.\n\nI just want to ask them to see us as a family who actually wants to serve the country.\n\nHe's now crowded into a rundown rented house with his eldest daughter and her husband \u2014 two bedrooms for the seven of them, trapped in a tough neighborhood in Baghdad. The family has no idea when it might get permission to travel.\n\nKhalid's younger brother, Ahmed, is now 23. He quit his job when he thought he was leaving in 2016 and hasn't had steady work since then.\n\n\"We sacrifice a lot \u2014 my brother shot twice,\" he says. \"Why us? Security check after security check. I just want to ask them to see us as a family who actually wants to serve the country,\" he said.\n\nFarley \u2014 like many other vets who promised their interpreters safety in the U.S. \u2014 says he is angry that his promise has been broken. And he thinks that is a national security issue.\n\n\"If I was in their shoes, and I learned about the stories of the U.S. not offering protection to people that stepped up and fought alongside their soldiers \u2014 or to their families of those heroes,\" Farley asks, \"why would I ever sign up to do that for the U.S.?\"", "description": "Veterans and dozens of lawmakers say they're afraid the promise they made to protect families who assisted U.S. forces is being broken.", "authors": ["Quil Lawrence", "Ahmed Al-Baidhani"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/05/01/farley1_wide-04722e31ceb3f410e4991573c8802d73de4f4fc2.jpg?s=1400"}
