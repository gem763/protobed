Three deputies were charged in the 2002 corruption case. One of them remains a small-town police officer in Louisiana, The Associated Press found.\n\nThe little-known case has drawn new attention and is highlighted in a Showtime docuseries examining the so-called Jeff Davis 8, a series of eight possibly related killings that remain unsolved despite the decade-long efforts of a local, state and federal task force.\n\nThe victims, ranging in age from 17 to 30, were killed between 2005 and 2009 in and around Jennings, Louisiana, a small town in Louisiana\u2019s Cajun country.\n\nThe records show the last Jeff Davis 8 victim, Necole Jean Guillory, had been a witness in the 2002 jail case. The five-part documentary, \u201cMurder in the Bayou,\u201d features footage of Guillory telling investigators about rampant misconduct inside the lockup.\n\nThe series finale, which airs Friday, reveals that Guillory told her mother shortly before her death that she believed local law enforcement had a hand in the slayings.\n\nThe Jefferson Davis Parish jail has seen more recent cases of misconduct, including this summer when two deputies were fired there for their role in a brutal beating that reportedly left an inmate with black eyes and second-degree burns.\n\nChief Deputy Chris Ivey said authorities recently transferred local inmates into a new facility that is more secure than the old parish jail, which was poorly lit and had spotty surveillance cameras. He told The AP none of the deputies accused of misconduct would be given badges by the current administration. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be working for us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe newly released records, obtained by Showtime and reviewed by The AP, show \u201ca pattern and practice of sexual assault by guards at the Jefferson Davis Parish Jail stretching back nearly two decades,\u201d said Ethan Brown, an executive producer of the series.\n\nGuillory had been \u201caware of significant law enforcement misconduct\u201d before she was found dead years later in a patch of grass along Interstate 10 in Acadia Parish, Brown said.\n\n\u201cShe was the most insistent of the victims that the police were behind the killings,\u201d Brown told the AP.\n\nBrown, in his book about the Jeff Davis 8, wrote that Guillory knew most of the other slain women through their involvement in sex work and long feared for her safety.\n\nGuillory\u2019s death remains a mystery. But the records show that she and several other women made detailed allegations about sexual misconduct involving deputies and inmates at the parish jail. The FBI interviewed at least one woman who said she had been raped, the records show, but no federal charges were filed.\n\nFormer Jefferson Davis Parish Sheriff Ricky Edwards said at the time that two deputies had been arrested for taking bribes to arrange sex between inmates. He said one had sex with a female inmate, while a third deputy was fired for smuggling contraband into the jail.\n\nWhat the sheriff did not say was that at least a half-dozen women had accused deputies of running a jailhouse sex-trafficking ring in which female inmates were repeatedly coerced into having sex with male inmates and trustees.\n\nOne woman told authorities she was forced to have sex with a deputy, Eric M. Phillips, and that nothing came of her repeated complaints to jail staff, the records show. The Associated Press does not identify people who may have been sexually assaulted unless they have come forward and voluntarily identify themselves.\n\n\u201cI just want it stopped because it\u2019s not right,\u201d the woman told sheriff\u2019s investigators.\n\nDetectives took similar statements from several other women, including one who spent just a week in the jail. She told authorities she had been wrested from her bunk one night by an \u201cunidentified assailant\u201d who covered her mouth and, while removing her pants, told her to \u201cgive it up,\u201d the records show.\n\nShe said she noticed Phillips, the jailer, watching the assault from the hallway.\n\nStill another woman said Phillips raped her after removing her from her cell under the pretense that she needed to see the jail nurse about her medicine.\n\n\u201cI wrote a letter to my mother describing what had happened to me,\u201d she wrote in a statement to authorities, \u201cbut for some reason my mother never received the letter.\u201d\n\nInvestigators also interviewed Guillory, then 19, who described a state of near anarchy in the jail. She told investigators she also had sex with Phillips, according to the records. Deputies are forbidden under state and federal law from having sexual contact with inmates.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get out of your cell, but you\u2019re still doing everything you\u2019re doing when you\u2019re at home,\u201d Guillory told authorities. She added that deputies routinely sold cigarettes, drugs and other contraband to inmates.\n\nPhillips later pleaded no contest to malfeasance in office, a felony, and was sentenced to a year in prison. He was not charged with sexual assault.\n\nPhillips this week said he knew nothing about the rape allegations. His brother later telephoned the AP to say Phillips, despite having served in law enforcement, was \u201cignorant when it comes to the law.\u201d He said Phillips regrets pleading no contest in the case and did so only at the advice of his attorney.\n\nAnother deputy fired in the scandal, Allarate \u201cA.J.\u201d Frank, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of criminal mischief. He later worked more than 10 years for the Eunice Police Department despite his conviction and recently ran for police chief of that city. He remains a police officer in the neighboring town of Basile.\n\nFrank declined to comment. His attorney, former Louisiana lawmaker Elbert Guillory, said the misconduct that could be proved against Frank amounted to a \u201cvery, very minor matter.\u201d\n\nEdwards, the former sheriff, did not return messages seeking comment. His lawyers suggested in a 2004 court filing that the female inmates may have \u201cwillingly\u201d participated in some of the crimes in his jail.\n\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Office later settled at least two federal lawsuits stemming from the alleged rapes.", "description": "At least a half-dozen women told authorities that deputies raped and trafficked them to male inmates inside a long-troubled jail in southwestern", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/10/a3a695_louisiana-jail-jeff-davis-parish-44089-undated-booking-photo-by-jefferson-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
