Futures plunged as the algos took over.\n\n\n\nWell, believe it or not, but that report was wrong.\n\n\n\nInstead, President Trump thinks the trade talks are \u201cgoing really well\u201d and he will be meeting with China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He tomorrow.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s quite the change in tone in less than 24 hours\u2026 but aren\u2019t we used to that by now?\n\n\n\nIt was only a couple days ago when visa restrictions and a trade blacklist seemed to doom this meeting altogether. And now investors believe that some kind of agreement is at least possible.\n\n\n\nOf course, the tone could change again just as quickly tomorrow.\n\n\n\nFor today though, the S&P advanced 0.64% to 2938.13, while the NASDAQ rose 0.60% (or around 47 points) to 7950.78. The was up 0.57% (or 150 points) to 26,496.67.\n\n\n\nThe major indices have each advanced by well over 1% over the past two days, though they are still down for the week heading into Friday.\n\n\n\nBut its nothing that some good trade news can\u2019t fix!\n\n\n\nThough a comprehensive deal still seems out of the question, it\u2019s not too much to ask that the two sides come to some sort of truce that might delay tariffs that are scheduled to be raised as soon as next week.\n\n\n\nIf we get a few good headlines like that, then the major indices should have enough fuel to rally on Friday and help the Dow and S&P snap their three-week losing streaks.\n\n\n\nThe bigger question is whether or not a minor agreement would be enough to get stocks back to new highs.\n\n\n\nBut first things first\u2026 let\u2019s see what happens tomorrow.\n\n\n\nToday's Portfolio Highlights:\n\n\n\nHome Run Investor: The rise of sportsbooks in this country will be a big boon for the gaming sector. Brian plans to capitalize by adding Scientific Games (SGMS), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) developer of technology-based products and services for worldwide gaming and lottery markets. The company seems poised to reach profitability in 2020, so the editor is getting in now. Read more about this new addition in the full write-up.\n\n\n\nCounterstrike: The market shrugged off concerns from earlier this week and has actually gained the past couple of sessions as the trade talks begin. However, Jeremy is concerned that the market could go right back down, especially if there\u2019s another negative headline (a very real possibility). Therefore, the editor decided to cash in some of his gain in SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG), which has been more volatile of late. Half of the position was sold for a return of 18.8% in just about a month.\n\n\n\nStocks Under $10: Never let it be said that Brian doesn\u2019t listen to his subscribers! Several of them had written to him about a company called Digital Turbine (APPS) and its \u201cwonderful chart\u201d. Well, on Thursday, the editor added this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) after a recent pullback. APPS offers products and solutions for mobile operators, device OEMs and third parties. More specifically, it connects top mobile operators, OEMs and publishers with app developers and advertisers around the world. The editor really appreciates that this company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters with an average surprise of 125%. So it doesn\u2019t just beat expectations, it trounces them! Learn a lot more about this new addition in the full write-up.\n\n\n\nUntil Tomorrow,\n\nJim Giaquinto\n\nRecommendations from Zacks' Private Portfolios:Believe it or not, this article is not available on the Zacks.com website.
