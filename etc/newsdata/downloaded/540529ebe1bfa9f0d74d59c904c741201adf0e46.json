Speaking at an event in the southern industrial port of Ulsan, Moon said his government is determined to support \"the hydrogen economy\" rooted in clean-energy cars.\n\nThe same day, the government announced plans to develop hydrogen and fuel-cell cars, which is what the \"hydrogen economy\" is shorthand for. The government spent the past three months huddled with experts in hydrogen and fuel-cell cars to come up with the plans.\n\nLast year, the Moon administration named artificial intelligence, big data and hydrogen cars as its three main areas of strategic investments.\n\nMoon visited a booth showcasing Hyundai's hydrogen-powered Nexo and joked, \"I am practically a product-endorsement model for Hyundai's fuel-cell cars these days.\" During a visit to France last October, Moon rode a Nexo and tried out a recharging station.\n\n", "description": "Moon Touts Hydrogen Cars in Visit to Ulsan", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/01/18/2019011801335_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-18"}
