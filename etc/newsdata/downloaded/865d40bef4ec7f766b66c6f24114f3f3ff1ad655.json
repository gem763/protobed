That\u2019ll see it compete with the likes of international heavyweights Spotify (which went live there last month) and Apple Music, as well as local incumbents like JioSaavn, Gaana, and Wynk.\n\nYouTube Music Premium offers a three-month free trial, after which your subscription fee will kick in. The company\u2019s also launching YouTube Premium for Rs. 129 ($1.85) per month: it unlocks access to ad-free YouTube and YouTube Originals, along with YouTube Music.\n\nIf you\u2019re already subscribed to Google Play Music, you\u2019ll get access to YouTube Music Premium membership as part of the package at no extra charge. Your purchased music, uploads and playlists will remain accessible in Google Play Music as usual.\n\nWith 245 million monthly active users across the country, India is one of YouTube\u2018s biggest markets \u2013 and that gives it a major advantage over its competitors. A report from App Annie published earlier this year suggests that YouTube is India\u2019s top video streaming app, and another report from Nielsen published in 2018 noted that it\u2019s the country\u2019s top source for streaming music.\n\nHowever, the challenge for the company is turning its massive user base into paying customers. While the country offers the cheapest mobile data plans on earth and is home to numerous digital payment services, many people who are coming online for the first time in India aren\u2019t yet used to paid subscription plans for streaming content.\n\nAs in other countries, YouTube is talking up its localized playlists and music videos to woo customers. It\u2019ll be interesting to watch these services duke it out for the top spot in this fast-growing market.\n\nTo get started, visit youtube.com/musicpremium, or download the YouTube Music app for Android and iOS.\n\nTNW Conference 2019 is coming!
