However, five days before he passed on, he was taken to hospital,\u201d he said at the EFF\u2019s memorial service which commemorated the fallen statesman.\n\nIn his speech, Zhuwao said Mugabe was unable to fulfil his dying wish because of Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\n\u201cHe [Mugabe] said and I quote: \u2018Zimbabwe is where I lived, Zimbabwe is where I will die\u2019 but president Mugabe did not die in Zimbabwe\u2026,\u201d Zhuwao said.\n\nMugabe died last Friday and his remains arrived in Zimbabwe on Wednesday.\n\nZhuwao as well as former Zimbabwean minister Saviour Kusukuwere were among those who spoke to scores of EFF supporters in Orlando on Thursday.\n\nEFF leader Julius Malema urged Mnangagwa to allow Zhuwao to attend his uncle\u2019s funeral.\n\nZhuwao has been barred from the ceremony, which is due to take place over the weekend.\n\nMalema said the charges laid against Zhuwao were \u201cconcocted\u201d and showed that Mnangagwa was \u201cthreatened by young people\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe call upon Mnangagwa and his regime to do the right thing and allow this comrade to go back and bury his own uncle. And if they do not want him, he will come back [and] we will receive him here in South Africa,\u201d Malema said during his speech.\n\nHe also appealed to Mnangagwa to allow all of Mugabe\u2019s supporters, including those who were arrested during the so called \u201csoft coup\u201d in 2017, to be allowed to attend the funeral.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t Mnangagwa release a statement that says all those who have worked with president Mugabe who are facing this or that charge for the purpose of this funeral you are all welcome,\u201d he said.\n\nZhuwao and Kusukuwere were among those who were expelled from the Zanu PF for being part of the group who wanted former first lady Grace Mugabe to succeed her husband in 2017.\n\nZhuwao was minister of public service, labour and social welfare, while Kusukuwere held the position of minister of local government.", "description": "Robert Mugabe\u2019s nephew, Patrick Zhuwao, gave details of the days leading up to his uncle\u2019s death, stating that he was only hospitalised five days before he passed on.", "authors": ["Queenin Masuabi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9357/1680a0ffcc714a55ac1c748477d71640.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
