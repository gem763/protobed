Police say he likely sustained a serious puncture wound and will have required medical treatment for it.\n\nThe attack is a chilling reminder of what happened to Aiia Maasarwe and Eurydice Dixon who were also attacked and sexually assaulted while walking alone in Melbourne.\n\nBoth women were murdered at the hands of men.\n\nDetective Acting Inspector Janet Mitchell said the attacker was \u201con a mission\u201d when he attacked the 32-year-old.\n\nShe said police are looking for a man in her early 20s who is caucasian and has light brown hair. He was wearing a hoodie and loose-fitting pants.\n\n\u201cIt could\u2019ve ended up much worse. I think the woman was very brave to act the way she did,\u201d Det Insp Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cShe obviously made an assessment and made a decision on how she would handle it and it turned out very well for her.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s quite frightening. I think he was on a mission. He saw the woman coming and he pursued her. When he could see that she was trying to get away, he tried to divert her attention, appealing to her good nature. He was able to grab her at that point.\u201d\n\nInvestigators have doorknocked the area extensively and are asking anybody who was in the area to contact police.\n\nCrime Stoppers: 1800 333 000 or www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.", "description": "A woman\u2019s act of bravery potentially saved her life on Saturday night after she was attacked by a sexual predator in a Melbourne park.", "authors": ["Rohan Smith"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6580d528ad481e37b7d1d46d9b03a0ef?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
