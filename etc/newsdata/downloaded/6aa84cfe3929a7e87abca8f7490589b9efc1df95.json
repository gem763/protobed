Maxim Shipenkov/Pool via REUTERS\n\nPakistan condemned India\u2019s decision last month to revoke the constitutional autonomy of Kashmir and Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday vowed the fullest possible response to India\u2019s actions in the disputed territory.\n\n\u201cThere are about 230 persons ready to infiltrate from different parts of Kashmir,\u201d Ajit Kumar Doval, national security adviser to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, told reporters.\n\nThe number is based on radio intercepts and intelligence from the ground, military officials said, adding that some militants had already been caught by Indian security forces.\n\n\u201cA large number of weapons are being smuggled and people in Kashmir are being told to create trouble,\u201d said Doval, who is considered one of the architects of the policy to withdraw Kashmir\u2019s special status and integrate it fully into India.\n\nIndia imposed a clampdown in India Kashmir in early August to prevent large scale violent protests. Some curbs have been eased, but mobile phone and internet services are still curtailed because they may be used to spark unrest, Doval said.\n\n\u201cWe would like to see all restrictions go, but it depends on how Pakistan behaves. It\u2019s a stimulant and response situation,\u201d Doval said.\n\n\u201cIf Pakistan starts behaving, terrorists don\u2019t intimidate and infiltrate,\u201d he added. \u201cPakistan stops sending signals through its towers to operatives, then we can lift restrictions.\u201d\n\nIndia has long accused Pakistan of training, arming and sending militants to Muslim majority Kashmir where it is fighting a nearly 30-year revolt.\n\nPakistan denies direct support but says it gives moral and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their struggle for self-determination.\n\nBUSINESSES TARGETED\n\nDoval cited an attack on a major apple merchant in Indian Kashmir as an example of Pakistan encouraging violence against people who are carrying on their businesses.\n\nThe merchant operated from Sopore, the fruit basket of the region and about 45 kms from Srinagar, and from where 700 truck deliveries of produce had been made in recent days.\n\nDoval said Pakistan and groups based there have frowned upon such signs of normalcy and rebuked militants inside Kashmir for failing to stop the trucks.\n\n\u201cAfter the trucks moved, there were repeated messages from Pakistan asking for this to stop,\u201d Doval said.\n\nOn Friday, two suspected militants attacked the merchant\u2019s home near Sopore, wounding his 25-year-old son and two-year-old granddaughter.\n\nThe assailants spoke the Punjabi language, suggesting they had come from Pakistan, and were on the run, Doval said.\n\nLast month, suspected militants killed a 65-year-old grocer for keeping his shop open on the outskirts of Kashmir\u2019s main city Srinagar, police said.\n\nIndian officials have vowed a strong response if a major militant attack is traced back to any Pakistan-based militant group.\n\nIn February, the countries engaged in an aerial clash after Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on an Indian paramilitary convoy in Kashmir.", "description": "More than 200 suspected militants are trying to cross into Indian Kashmir from Pakistan, India's national security adviser said on Saturday, accusing Islamabad of trying to stoke violence in the region.", "authors": ["Sanjeev Miglani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427233571&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860G6", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
