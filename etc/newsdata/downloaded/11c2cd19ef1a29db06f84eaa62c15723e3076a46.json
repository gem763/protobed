They are vulnerable people and we must do what we can for them.\n\n\u2018It is entirely wrong to associate them with what their parents may have done.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree British children were believed to have been evacuated from a detention camp at Ain Issa last week, Save the Children said.\n\nFormer Brexit secretary David Davis said the children are at risk of \u2018turning into terrorists\u2019 (Picture: Parliament.tv)\n\nThe charity\u2019s head of humanitarian conflict and campaigns, Alison Griffin, stated that the vast majority of children were still with their mothers in Syria.\n\nShe said: \u2018Children whose parents are alive are just as innocent as those who have been orphaned. All have been put through unimaginable horrors.\n\n\u2018The foreign secretary has said he wants to ensure innocents are not caught in the crossfire.\n\n\u2018To play his part to achieve that, he needs to act now while there\u2019s still a window of opportunity and bring all the UK\u2019s children home.\u201d\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
