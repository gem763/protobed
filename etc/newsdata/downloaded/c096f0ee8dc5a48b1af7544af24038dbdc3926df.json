The range of this move is nearly $500 \u2014 some 5.2% at current price points.\n\nThe chart below from TradingView sums up the absolutely absurd bout of volatility that the cryptocurrency market just saw quite well. It isn\u2019t clear what triggered this move, yet some suggest that there was a confluence of large sell orders in and around the $8,800 resistance.\n\nAccording to prominent crypto analyst Josh Rager, who was tracking the price action live via a Youtube video, the large wick to $8,800 on the upside may be a sign of an impending reversal.\n\nSeeing that Bitcoin has seen positive price action over the past few days, the massive upper wick implies a bearish reversal.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, trader CryptoHamster has noted that Bitcoin\u2019s latest jump and flash reversal continues to satisfy the theory that the cryptocurrency market is just in a fractal (a repeated pattern on a smaller scale) of 2018\u2019s bear market.\n\nShould the fractal play out in full, Bitcoin may begin to head back into the $9,000 to $10,000 in the middle of next week.\n\nPump N\u2019 Dump Comes After Bitcoin ETF Rejection\n\nThis 5% hourly range comes just after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that it had denied Bitwise\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application on the grounds that it believes the cryptocurrency market is susceptible manipulation.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t clear if this \u201cpump n\u2019 dump\u201d, so to speak, was a result of manipulative players, it likely doesn\u2019t instill confidence in the SEC, who is doing its utmost best to protect investors in American markets.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Well, would you look at that \u2014 within the span of literally an hour, the Bitcoin price surged to $8,820 to dump to $8,350 just minutes later.
