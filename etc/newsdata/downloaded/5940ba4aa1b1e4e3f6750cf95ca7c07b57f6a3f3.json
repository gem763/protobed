First, the matter will be considered by a panel of two to three judges, and will either be dismissed or approved. The parties may be called to a brief hearing for further consideration. A decision about whether special leave to appeal will be granted is usually made on the same day as the hearing.\n\nAt the verdict George Pell didn't flinch; he just pursed his lips a little. He was going back to jail | David Marr Read more\n\nAt least five and sometimes all seven justices of the high court will hear the appeal if it is granted. The appeals process can take several months, and is unlikely to be considered before 2020. In the meantime, Pell remains in Melbourne Assessment Prison, receiving letters and visits from his supporters. Pell has maintained his innocence throughout the process.\n\nThe 78 year-old was sentenced to a six-year prison sentence for sexually abusing two 13-year-old former choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral when he was the archbishop of Melbourne in 1996. He will be eligible for parole after serving a term of three years and eight months.\n\nIn August the Victorian court of appeal \u2013 the highest court in the state \u2013 dismissed Pell\u2019s appeal. He had 28 days to appeal to the high court, with lawyers filing his application at the 11th hour on Tuesday. However, filing at the last minute is not unusual.\n\nHow George Pell lost his appeal and what happens next \u2013 The Reckoning podcast Read more\n\nThe jury had not been unreasonable in convicting Pell on one count of sexual penetration of a child under the age of 16 and four counts of an indecent act against a child under the age of 16, the Victorian court of appeal chief justice, Anne Ferguson, and appeal court president justice, Chris Maxwell, previously found.\n\nA third judge, Mark Weinberg, disagreed, finding the complainant was inclined to embellish aspects of his testimony and that he could not exclude the possibility that some of what he said was concocted. But in the court of appeal, judges are required only to reach a majority decision, which meant Pell\u2019s appeal failed.\n\nBut in the appeal filed to the high court, Pell\u2019s lawyers say Ferguson and Maxwell were wrong. \u201cThere did remain a reasonable doubt as to the existence of any opportunity for the offending to have occurred,\u201d the filing said.\n\n\u201cThe majority [of judges] erred by finding that their belief in the complainant required the applicant (Pell) to establish that the offending was impossible in order to raise and leave a doubt\u201d.\n\nLosing my religion \u2013 after the Pell verdict, the conflict for Catholics | Brigid Delaney Read more\n\nIn a criminal trial it is up to prosecutor\u2019s to establish proof, not the defendant to prove innocence, and the filing says the Victorian appellant judges wrongfully reversed this onus of proof.\n\nOne of Pell\u2019s victims died of an accidental drug overdose in 2014 at age 30. His father is being represented by Lisa Flynn from Shine Lawyers. She said her client was \u201cbeyond disappointed\u201d to hear of the appeal.\n\n\u201cThis painful period of his life is simply not coming to an end which continues to take a toll on his health,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cEvery time Pell takes his legal fight to the next level our client is reminded of the disgusting abuse he inflicted on his son as a young choirboy.\n\n\u201cHe has no doubt George Pell sexually abused his son and that his son\u2019s sudden turmoil and devastation of his life was a direct result of the abuse he suffered inside Melbourne\u2019s St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral at the hands of George Pell. Although he knew this was a possibility, it is still very hard for him to take when his son\u2019s abuser was found guilty by a unanimous jury.\u201d", "description": "Former Vatican treasurer has maintained his innocence after the Victorian court of appeal ruled two-to-one against his appeal", "authors": ["Melissa Davey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50d3b86aa9372fd8317b85afe62ee1228f87045b/0_95_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f39680203c662f59e1b80ba84c16d7a2", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
