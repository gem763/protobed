The inspector general noted that firsthand knowledge had not been required and that the whistleblower followed procedures that had been in place since May 2018.\n\nAtkinson noted in his letter to DOJ that the OLC memo creates \"uncertainty\" about whether or not employees with the intelligence community will be protected from reprisal if they provide information about an urgent concern, only for it to be later determined that the information was outside of their jurisdiction.\n\nThe government watchdogs, in their letter this week, agreed with Atkinson, saying protections from whistleblowers shouldn't be reduced because of the Justice Department's stance.\n\n\"If intelligence community employees and contractors believe that independent IG determinations may be second guessed, effectively blocking the transmission of their concerns to Congress and raising questions about the protections afforded to them, they will lose confidence in this important reporting channel and their willingness to come forward with information will be chilled,\" the inspectors general wrote.\n\n\"More generally, this concern is not limited to the intelligence community but will have a chilling effect that extends to employees, contractors, and grantees in other parts of the government, who might not consider it worth the effort and potential impact on themselves to report suspected wrongdoing if they think that their efforts to disclose information will be for naught or, worse, that they risk adverse consequences for coming forward when they see something they think is wrong,\" they added.", "description": "Dozens of government watchdogs are warning that a Justice Department memo arguing that the head of the intelligence community wasn't required to give the Ukraine complaint to Congress cou", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/horowitzmichael_061918am_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
