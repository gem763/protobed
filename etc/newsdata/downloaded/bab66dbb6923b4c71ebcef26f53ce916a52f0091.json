The government is also suspending manufacturing at state-run steel and cement plans to reduce energy consumption. Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz Canel said the island\u2019s crucial tourism industry hasn\u2019t been affected.\n\nMr. D\u00edaz Canel said on Wednesday that the island\u2019s fuel shortage was temporary, as Cuba expects to receive an oil tanker on Saturday and strives to make those supplies last until the end of the month, when more tankers were due. October fuel deliveries have been assured, he added. Most of Cuba\u2019s fuel comes from Venezuela.\n\n\u201cCuba is not paralyzed,\u201d said Economy Minister Alejandro Gil Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\nVideos published on social media showed masses of Cubans trying to cram into buses in the country\u2019s capital. Transport Minister Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez D\u00e1vila said the city\u2019s bus services had been cut to 600,000 passengers a day from 1.1 million. Bus trips had been reduced to 4,000 from 7,000 a day.\n\n\u201cThe police are stopping state cars that are empty, and filling them up with people,\u201d said Liber Tostonet, who runs a small business renting cellphones and repairing computers. Mr. Tostonet was hopeful that other Cuban allies, like Russia, would come to the island\u2019s help.\n\nEnergy and Mines Minister Raul Garc\u00eda Barreiro said available diesel resulting from the suspension of industrial activities will be used \u201cfor food distribution and supporting the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nOfficials also warned that fuel shortages could happen again given the hostile state of relations between Havana and Washington.\n\nPeople lined up to take public transportation in Havana on Thursday.

In recent months, the U.S. has banned cruise ship travel to Cuba and limited the amount of money that Cuban Americans can send to their relatives on the island.\n\nIn a bid to cut off Cuban support for Socialist President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela, it has sanctioned ships and firms delivering Venezuelan oil to Cuba.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has failed in overthrowing the (Venezuelan) government and blames Cuba for the Venezuelan situation,\u201d Mr. D\u00edaz Canel said on state television. \u201cThey are determined to stop the flow of fuel to Cuba.\u201d\n\nCuba\u2019s fragile economy has been hit hard by the U.S. sanctions and the economic collapse of Venezuela, its chief ally on which it depends for much of the subsidized oil it receives. In exchange for Venezuelan crude, Cuba provides the services of thousands of doctors and security officials the U.S. blames for the survival of Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.\n\nIf Cuba\u2019s ties with Venezuela were to be severed, it would cost the island $8 billion in payments and subsidized oil, while its GDP would contract an estimated 4% to 8%, according to Carmelo Mesa Lago, an expert on the Cuban economy at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nEarlier this year, shipments of Venezuelan crude and oil products to Cuba had fallen to 47,000 barrels a day from a high of 105,000 in 2012. At its peak in 2013, Venezuela\u2019s contribution to Cuba\u2019s GDP was 22%, a figure that had fallen to 8.5% by 2017, Mr. Mesa Lagos said.\n\nMaking things worse, in recent years, Cuba\u2019s own oil production has fallen from 52,000 barrels a day to about 43,000, said Jorge Pi\u00f1\u00f3n, an oil expert at the University of Texas.\n\nFrank Mora, director of Latin American studies at Florida International University, said it was unclear how much of the island\u2019s sudden energy crisis could be attributed to U.S. sanctions against ships carrying Venezuelan oil, a reduction in Venezuelan shipments, or a Cuban attempt to prepare the island for a worsening situation in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cWhat has changed in the last six months?\u201d asked Mr. Mora. \u201cAre they taking precautions for when something bad happens in Venezuela or are they being affected now?\u201d\n\nMr. D\u00edaz Canel tried to reassure Cubans that the energy shortage wasn\u2019t a prelude to an economic meltdown reminiscent of the \u201cspecial period\u201d in Cuba that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the early 1990s, Cuba\u2019s economy shrunk at least 35%, and the island endured widespread hunger. Earlier this year, Cuba\u2019s government implemented stricter food rationing.\n\n\u201cThe problems are solely to do with energy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are ships arriving with food.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jos\u00e9 de C\u00f3rdoba at jose.decordoba@wsj.com", "description": "Cuba\u2019s Communist government is taking emergency measures to avoid power blackouts and contain a severe fuel shortage it blames on U.S. attempts to cut off the island\u2019s oil lifeline with Venezuela.", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 De C\u00f3rdoba"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107137/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
