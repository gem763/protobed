Had we not sent a clear signal that we would use that time constructively to follow our democratic processes to break the gridlock in Westminster, it is not at all certain that we would have been offered the extension MPs requested in the Benn Act.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are the strongest Remain party in the UK, and we have been the loudest, clearest voice in Westminster in favour of a People\u2019s Vote on Brexit with Remain on the ballot. We have tabled 17 amendments and motions to provide for a People\u2019s Vote in this parliament.\n\nHowever, at every turn, we have been blocked from doing so by a significant minority of Labour MPs, 19 of which even voted for Boris Johnson\u2019s disastrous hard Brexit, and pro-Brexit Conservative MPs. Just last week we tabled an amendment to the Queen\u2019s Speech calling for a People\u2019s Vote, but due to Labour refusing to support it or even bother to table one itself, no such amendment was chosen by the speaker for debate.\n\nSo in a House of Commons without the numbers to pass a People\u2019s Vote, the only option left for Remainers is to support a general election before the government\u2019s withdrawal bill can pass. This is the conclusion both the Liberal Democrats and SNP reached when we made our proposals over the weekend. It is important to note that last week Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson met to discuss how to facilitate the passage of Johnson\u2019s bill through parliament \u2013 they did not meet to discuss how legislation for a People\u2019s Vote could be carried.\n\nWe are clear, though, that we cannot accept an election on the government\u2019s terms for several reasons. The prime minister\u2019s plan, having invoked the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, would mean that he could retrospectively change the election date until after the new Brexit deadline and there would be no way for MPs legally to stop him. It would also be on the condition that the withdrawal bill is brought back, opening the door to Labour and Conservative MPs passing the bill before the election is called. This is not acceptable, which is why we will be voting against his motion for a 12 December election tonight.\n\nIt is for these reasons that our leader Jo Swinson, with the backing of the SNP, published our plan for a December election. Despite MPs from both Labour and the Conservatives dismissing the bill as a \u201cgimmick\u201d, it is now being treated seriously on all sides of the House of Commons.\n\nOur bill would achieve several things if passed this week.\n\nFirst, it would set in stone the date of the next election in law for 9 December. This would mean that Boris Johnson could not change the date to after our scheduled exit day.\n\nSecond, the timings in the bill would mean that there would not be time for the government to bring back the withdrawal bill before parliament dissolved later this week. It would effectively halt the Brexit process until the people can have their say.\n\nThird, it would lock in our extension date of 31 January, and cease to have effect if for any reason this date changed to ensure we could not crash out of the European Union without a deal during a campaign.\n\nIf adopted by either of the main parties \u2013 who both claim they want an early general election \u2013 our plan would be far more certain to pass the Commons, paving the way for a an election in December where Remainers will get our chance to vote for what we have been campaigning for, to remain in the European Union.\n\nSome in Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet have criticised our move over the weekend \u2013 which is rather ridiculous given the party has a live petition on its website (which you can sign here) that says: \u201cGiven that Boris Johnson has no mandate from the people, the Tories should call an immediate general election and let the public have their say.\u201d Rather than focusing their fire on the Lib Dems, they should work out what their position on Brexit actually is \u2013 after a huge row at their conference, they refused to back remaining in the EU. What they want beyond that is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nThere is no such ambiguity on our side. If there is a Liberal Democrat majority government after the next election, we will revoke Article 50 and end the chaos immediately so we can focus on the real issues. And of course if there is anything short of that, we will continue to push for a People\u2019s Vote, which a majority could be produced for with a new parliament. Either way, our plan represents the best hope Remainers have for stopping Brexit. Let\u2019s make sure when the election starts, we are ready and waiting to campaign for our future in Europe.\n\nChuka Umunna is the Liberal Democrat MP for Streatham", "description": "It has been rare to receive good news during the course of the Brexit process, but this morning the European Union confirmed that it would offer the UK the extension to Article 50, avoiding us crashing out of the EU later this week.", "authors": ["Chuka Umunna"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/19/Chuka-Umunna-conference-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
