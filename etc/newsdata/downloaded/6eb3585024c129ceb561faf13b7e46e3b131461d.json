It completes the picture. Many millions of people have wondered since 1963 how this most audacious crime could have been pulled off without very significant planning and discipline.\n\nHe added: 'The involvement of the Krays and [London gangster Billy] Hill solves that mystery. No one who knows about the robbery would conclude that any of the robbers arrested could have ''put the job together''.'\n\nWho were the Ronnie and Reggie Kray? Ronnie and Reggie Kray ruled the London gangland scene in the late 50s and 'Swinging Sixties' with their notorious East End gang 'The Firm'. Of the two siblings, Ronnie was considered the more dangerous. He was imprisoned in 1957 for GBH. While locked up, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, which partly explained his violent tendencies. Despite Reggie also being jailed in 1959, the Krays' 'business' activities went from strength to strength, and by the Sixties they were hobnobbing with stars such as Barbara Windsor, and eminent politicians such as Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie is alleged to have had an affair. After opening a club in Mile End, they began demanding money from criminals and by the early 1960s they were making up to the equivalent of \u00a310million every year. Reggie was given a life sentence in 1969 for the murder of Jack 'The Hat' McVitie, who he repeatedly stabbed in the face and neck for not following orders. Ronnie was also convicted of the murder of George Cornell, whom he shot between the eyes in the Blind Beggar pub in the East End of London after being called a 'fat poof'. Ronnie died of a heart attack in Broadmoor, the hospital for the criminally insane, on March 17 1995, aged 61. Reggie, who was released from prison on compassionate parole with just weeks to live, died from bladder cancer in October 2000.\n\nHe wrote in the book: \u2018Did Tom Wisbey [one of the train robbers] ever admit the Krays were involved? Well, he certainly wasn\u2019t keen to. It was more that he acquiesced \u2018\u2018for the sake of the story\u2019\u2019.\u2019\n\nThe Krays were also close to who Mr Satchwell says was the mastermind behind the robbery - Billy Hill.\n\nHe claimed the brutal 1950s London gangster had been the brains behind the operation - not Bruce Reynolds as has been suggested.\n\nThe author wrote: \u2018There is good evidence to be found of collaboration between the Krays and Billy Hill for anyone who cares to do a little research.\u2019\n\nMr Satchwell cited books that delved into the Krays' times with Hill in Tangier, Morocco, in the 1950s, as well as business links between the gangsters.\n\nHe added: \u2018Regarding the Krays, it cannot be doubted that in 1963 they would have been delighted to be part of any major crime that their hero and associate, Hill, was planning.\u2019\n\n'And the association between train robbers and the Kray family did not stop in 1963. I can say with absolute certainty... that members of the old Kray firm were still involved with former train robbers right up until the 1980s.\u2019\n\n\u2018My final point is this: in 1963, no other firm of enforcers in London better fitted the job description that Hill was trying to fill.\u2019\n\nHe continued to MailOnline: 'The mastermind was obsessed with security. He believed that the authorities were desperate to lock him away.\n\n'He needed to stay out of direct contact with all those taking part in the robbery ''on the ground''. He needed \u2018'middlemen\u2019': The Krays. They were the obvious choice.'\n\nHe added: 'They had known many of the great train robbers for years, as well of course, the man they idolised and befriended - the man running the job, Billy Hill.'\n\nThere was also circumstantial evidence linking the twins to the heist, according to the book.\n\nThe Krays were known for their business dealings in London, but the author says they also spread up to Glasgow too - where the fateful train started its journey.\n\nBilly Hill (pictured left and right on his return from Australia where he was refused entry) was the architect of the heist, according to former detective Mr Satchwell. He was also close to the Krays\n\nThe author wrote: \u2018There is good evidence to be found of collaboration between the Krays and Billy Hill for anyone who cares to do a little research\u2019 Pictured: The Kray Brothers and lieutenant Teddy Smith\n\nThe Krays were known for their business dealings in London, but the author says they also spread up to Glasgow too - where the fateful train (pictured) started its journey\n\nMr Satchwell said the brothers were in cahoots with Scottish gangster Arthur Thompson from at least 1963 - the year of the robbery - and Ronnie had 'mysterious' flying visits to the city that year.\n\nHe wrote: 'Importantly, Ronnie Kray flew to Glasgow several times in 1963 to meet with Glasgow gangsters.'\n\nThe former policeman said the Great Train Robbery should now be viewed in two parts - the heist itself and the aftermath.\n\nHe said: 'The first part was brilliantly executed by Hill and the Krays. The second part was a complete fiasco and quickly resulted in the detection of the majority of the foot soldiers.'\n\nMr Satchwell said the brothers were in cahoots with Scottish gangster Arthur Thompson from at least 1963 - the year of the robbery - and Ronnie had 'mysterious' flying visits to the city that year.

He died in 2013.\n\nRonald 'Buster' Edwards is widely believed to be the man who wielded a cosh used to hit train driver Jack Mills over the head.\n\nHe fled to Mexico after the heist but gave himself up in 1966, serving nine years in jail and then becoming a familiar figure selling flowers outside Waterloo station in London.\n\nDuring the heist a gang stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed through the Buckinghamshire countryside close to Cheddington (pictured)\n\nGang 'treasurer' Charlie Wilson was captured quickly and during his trial at Aylesbury Crown Court in 1964 earned the nickname 'the silent man' as he refused to say anything.\n\nHe was jailed for 30 years but escaped after just four months. He was captured again in Canada after four years on the run and served 10 more years in jail.\n\nHe was the final train robber to emerge from prison in 1978 but was shot in the head in Marbella in 1990 reportedly after a drugs-related quarrel.\n\nBiggs played a minor role in the robbery, but his life as a fugitive after escaping from prison gained him notoriety.\n\nHe was given a 30-year sentence in 1964, but he escaped after 15 months by fleeing over the walls of London's Wandsworth prison in April 1965.\n\nAfter having plastic surgery, he lived as a fugitive for 36 years in first Australia then Brazil, where he fathered a son Michael.\n\nHis health deteriorated in 2001 and he returned to the UK voluntarily where he was sent back to prison.\n\nHe was finally freed in 2009 on 'compassionate grounds' by then Justice Secretary Jack Straw who said he was not expected to recover. He died in 2013.\n\nNightclub owner Bob Welch was sentenced to 30 years in jail but was released in 1976.\n\nHe was later left crippled after an operation on his leg went wrong.\n\nAfter jail he became a car dealer and gambler in London. He attended Reynolds's funeral earlier this year.\n\nHe is the last remaining member of the gang.\n\nGreat Train Robbery Confidential by Graham Satchwell and published by The History Press is available on Amazon", "description": "The violent criminals (pictured) visited Glasgow before the heist, were friends with known robbers and would have wanted to be involved, according to former detective Graham Satchwell.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/12/19360112-0-image-a-102_1570363042911.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
