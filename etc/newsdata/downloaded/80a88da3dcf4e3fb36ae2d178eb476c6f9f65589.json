Now even she must know that she is the real deal.\n\nIt was staggering enough to see her go toe-to-toe \u2013 and then topple \u2013 an all-time great in Nafi Thiam to claim a heptathlon gold medal in Doha. But it was the way she did it that really seared into both skin and soul.\n\nOver the two days of competition Johnson-Thompson never gave off a slightest whiff of weakness as she set four individual personal bests to keep Thiam at bay.\n\nAnd then, when victory was in the bag, she continued to push her body through the pain barrier on the final event, the 800m, to score 6,981 points \u2013 a tally that surpassed Jessica Ennis\u2011Hill\u2019s British record of 6,955, which had stood as tall and imposing as an obelisk since London 2012.\n\nAs Johnson-Thompson burst into tears after crossing the line conceded that all the injuries, heartbreaks and self-eviscerations during the last few years were worth it. \u201cIt makes it more special and sweet for sure,\u201d she said beaming. \u201cThis is crazy for me.\u201d\n\nWorld Athletics Championships: Johnson-Thompson wins heptathlon gold \u2013 live! Read more\n\nOf course, this being Johnson-Thompson it was natural to fear some calamity or other would arise in the 800m, even when she had a 137\u2011point lead. A trip or a fall, perhaps, or even a random act of God. After all, at the Commonwealth Games last year she injured her calf with just 300m to go and had to do an improptu triple jump \u2013 hop, skipping and jumping her way to victory. But this time there were no travails or torments, just another personal best of 2:07:26 and elation.\n\nJohnson-Thompson had laid the groundwork on the opening day, setting personal bests in the 100m hurdles and shot put to lead by Thiam by 96 points overnight.\n\nIf the Briton was nervous going into the second day it did not show. A massive long jump of 6.77m \u2013 her best in a heptathlon and well ahead of the Belgian\u2019s 6.35m \u2013 extended her lead to 216 points.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nThe question was whether Thiam could respond in the javelin. A heavily-strapped arm to protect an injured elbow suggested otherwise, and the Belgian could only throw out to 48.04m \u2013 more than 10 metres below her best. Johnson-Thompson\u2019s response? Another personal best of 43.93m.\n\nIt meant that Thiam had to finish nine seconds ahead of her in the 800m \u2013 and given that the Belgian\u2019s personal best was eight seconds slower it was never going to happen. \u201cI was always worried!\u201d Johnson-Thompson joked afterwards. \u201cI thought I was going to run out of the line in the 800m and I was going to get disqualified. I didn\u2019t take anything for granted until I saw my name on the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cNafi is an phenomenal athlete, she has set the standard, she is one of the greats like Carolina Kluft. I witnessed 7,000 points first through her. She has raised the bar. I am glad I have been able to step up and be competitive.\u201d\n\nNo wonder she was elated. It is a long time since she burst into the public\u2019s consciousness at London 2012, an eager young apprentice learning at the foot of Ennis-Hill. Most expected a smooth succession, the flame passing from one Briton to another, but instead Johnson-Thompson had to suffer a seven-year itch before getting her due rewards.\n\nEarlier in her career she would constantly visualise herself standing on the podium, the national anthem striking up and a gold medal round her neck, thinking that if she only believed enough it would happen.\n\nDina Asher-Smith sets sights on being all-time great after Doha 200m triumph Read more\n\nIf only. There were European, Commonwealth and world indoor gold medals but when it really mattered injuries and ill-fortune got in the way. At the 2015 world championships she fouled three times in a row in the long jump while favourite. At the Rio Olympics a quadriceps injury flared up. Then, in front of her home crowd at the London 2017 world championships, she fluffed her lines in the high jump.\n\nIt did not help either that she was up against Thiam of course. But she accepted the Belgian\u2019s challenge, and pushed herself to be even better. \u201cThe low moments have helped me come back, to make the move to France, to take care of myself. I am so happy with this.\u201d\n\nShe also grew up. For years Johnson-Thompson was a self\u2011confessed \u201cmummy\u2019s girl\u201d who had most things done for her. But moving to Montpellier in early 2017 to join a renowned group that included the Kevin Mayer, the world decathlon record holder, changed everything.\n\n\u201cMoving to France has paid off,\u201d Johnson-Thompson said. \u201cIt has been such a long road, I am glad I am coming into my best in these next two years.\u201d\n\nWhen she first arrived, her coaches would call her \u201cdroopy\u201d because she used to drop her head in competitions, while her coach, Bertrand Valcin, kept telling her to smile more. On a glorious night in Doha, she fulfilled those orders to the letter.", "description": "Katarina Johnson-Thompson broke the British record to claim gold in the heptathlon at the world championships in Doha", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4066097cdc94d7301d7bb7a91a1bd09720c1b15/0_33_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd69b00ad9acad8899b29b8050e370b6"}
