Grease and line a 35 cm springform cake tin.\n\nMelt the chocolate and butter together in the microwave or in a double boiler on the stovetop.\n\nWhile that is melting, separate the eggs into two bowls. Add 100 g of the coconut sugar to the egg whites and the remaining 400 g to the yolks. Beat the yolks for about 7 minutes or until pale. Beat the whites until soft peaks form.\n\nOnce the chocolate and butter mixture is melted, take off the heat and stir in the vanilla, 250 ml (1 cup) of the hazelnuts and the espresso shot. Set aside.\n\nFold the cocoa powder and the egg white mixture into the fluffy egg yolk mixture.\n\nGently fold in the chocolate and butter mixture and salt.\n\nOnce combined, pour into the prepared springform tin and bake for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin. (It will sink slightly, but this is normal.) Dust with cocoa and top with the remaining hazelnuts.\n\nEven more indulgent served warm with a few blobs of thick cream.\n\nReprinted with permission of Kate Lund and Rebecca Lund from their Delish Sisters cookbook published by Penguin Random House South Africa.\n\n\n\n", "description": "This cake has an almost meringue-like texture on top, and is dense and rich on the inside.
