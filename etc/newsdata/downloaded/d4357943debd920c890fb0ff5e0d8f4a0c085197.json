Other signs drove home the message: \"Everyone for Peace\", \"Nothing for War\" and \"Fashion is a political act\".\n\nDesigner Angela Maria Herrera worked with around 30 former fighters from Colombia's mountainous Icononzo area.\n\n\"Our clothes carry messages of peace. Some were made by ex-combatants, but tailored by victims of violence, so the message of reconciliation is intrinsic.\"\n\nFormer guerrilla Melina Reyes presented a flowered dress, carrying a sign calling on the government to fulfill its promises under the deal.\n\n\"These are the clothes we are making, men and women who are betting on peace, that left their rifles behind, who said 'no' to the war, and want to continue like this,\" she said.\n\n- Jungle fashion -\n\nThe private Andean University of Bogota hosted the fashion event to mark the International Day of Peace on September 21.\n\nEvent organizer Leonardo Gonzalez said it underlined the young people around him \"do not want to return to war.\"\n\nThe United Nations says although a \"vast majority\" of about 13,000 former FARC combatants and their civilian collaborators remain committed to peace, the return to arms of some factions -- and the thousands who never disarmed at all -- is undermining efforts to overcome more than half a century of conflict.\n\nReyes wants to turn the page and says fashion provides her with an opportunity to put into practice a talent acquired in the jungle.\n\n\"We altered the clothes we were given because they were standard sizes, too big for some of us, and too tight for others,\" another woman said.\n\n\"We also started the idea of fashion in the ranks of the guerrillas,\" she said, laughing.\n\n\"We were stylists, the tailors of the guerrilla movement.\"", "description": "Once dressed to kill as they stalked the Colombian jungle, a group of young former FARC rebels have shed their camouflage fatigues, boots and guns to help ease their way back into society following a 2016 peace deal.
