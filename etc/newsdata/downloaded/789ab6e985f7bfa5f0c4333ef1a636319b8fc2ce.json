The MMA fighter then suddenly appeared and easily took Benjamin down.\n\nVelasquez got in a number of punches on Benjamin before he put him into a sleeper hold. Benjamin was able to escape and quickly retreated to the back. Velasquez has a history with Lesnar as he defeated The Beast nine years ago for the UFC Championship.\n\nAlso on Raw, living legend Ric Flair selected Drew McIntyre as the final member Team Flair who will be taking on Hulk Hogan\u2019s Team Hogan at Crown Jewel.\n\nRandy Orton, King Corbin, Bobby Lashley, Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura and McIntyre make up Flair\u2019s team and will be taking on the likes of Roman Reigns, Rusev, Ricochet, Shorty G and Ali of Team Hogan.\n\nMcIntyre took on Ricochet in a one-on-one match, defeating the high-flyer with a Claymore. McIntyre then continued to assault Ricochet after the bout, slamming him into the steel steps.\n\nIn the main event, The Street Profits made their in-ring debut on Raw as they took on O.C. members Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson in a Tag Team match.\n\nThe Street Profits found themselves having to deal with O.C. member and United States Champion AJ Styles as he interfered in the match.\n\nKevin Owens would arrive onto the scene and take Styles out with a Stunner outside the ring. The Street Profits took advantage of the moment with Montez Ford hitting Anderson with a Frog Splash for the victory.\n\nOther moments from Raw include Aleister Black defeating Jason Reynolds; Rusev attacking Lashley inside of a resturant where Lashley was taking out Rusev\u2019s wife Lana; Andrade defeating Sin Cara; Sunil Singh surprising R-Truth to become the new 24/7 Champion; Raw Tag Team Champions The Viking Raiders defeating Zack Ryder and Curt Hawkins; and Universal Champion Seth Rollins defeating Humberto Carrillo.\n\nRollins shook Carrillo\u2019s hand after the match as the former 205 Live star put up a valiant effort against the champ.", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 Former UFC Champion Cain Velasquez appeared on Raw in order to aid his friend Rey Mysterio.
