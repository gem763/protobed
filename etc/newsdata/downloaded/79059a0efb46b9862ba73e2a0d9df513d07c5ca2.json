It shows that the team\u2019s killer instinct is still sharpening. Even the stars of the side are being held to account by their team-mates, a characteristic of the very best Liverpool sides over the years.\n\nWhen Klopp took over at Anfield there was a feeling that the team were not tough enough. They could be bullied by opponents and took setbacks too easily for their manager\u2019s liking. Graeme Souness called Arsene Wenger\u2019s Arsenal \u201ca team of son-in-laws,\u201d suggesting that the squad at the Emirates were too nice. Similar insults could be applied to Liverpool.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Burnley vs Liverpool player ratings Show all 22 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

They hold each other to account. When a mistake on the field is made, the disapproval of colleagues can be even more cutting than the criticism of a manager. Mane\u2019s outburst shows that Liverpool have reached the point where the players are self-policing. It is a great place to be.\n\nSalah and Mane have a good friendship. It shows in their interactions on the pitch. That should not stop them pushing each other in private or public.\n\nSometimes even bad relationships are good for the team. Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez did not get on. The rivalry pushed both players to try and outdo the other. The 2013-14 season was the most productive of the Englishman\u2019s career as he strove to outscore his fellow forward. The uneasy partnership almost fired Liverpool to the title.\n\nTraditionally, players at Anfield were encouraged to let those around them know if they were not maintaining the required standard. Under Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan in the 1980s, the dressing room was controlled by Kenny Dalglish and his fellow Scots Souness and Alan Hansen. Any sign of weakness on the pitch was pounced upon and called out. If things were going wrong no one was immune to criticism. \u201cIf you were tired, not contributing or slacking, they didn\u2019t want to know you,\u201d Craig Johnston, the Australian midfielder, said. \u201cThey kept everyone in line. They kept the rest of the team professional. They were savage about getting the job done in the most direct way.\u201d\n\nThey would approve of Mane\u2019s approach.\n\nDalglish and Souness were \u2013 and remain \u2013 close mates but when Liverpool reached half-time 3-0 down to Coventry City at Highfield Road in December 1983, the bonds of friendship were severely tested.\n\nThe dressing room was in uproar with Alan Kennedy, the left back, the main focus for criticism but Souness \u2013 whose nickname was \u2018Champagne Charlie\u2019 \u2013 began rowing with Dalglish. \u201cIt went out of control,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cKenny and Charlie were going for it. It started over something small, like \u2018you didn\u2019t pass to me, you greedy bastard,\u2019 and blew up. I\u2019d never seen anything like it before or since. The big beasts went for each other. It was excellent viewing.\u201d\n\nThe spat was quickly forgotten. Liverpool ended up losing 4-0 that day but went on to win the title, the League Cup and the European Cup that season.\n\nJohnston\u2019s amusement was echoed by Roberto Firmino\u2019s at Turf Moor. The Brazilian was acting as a peacemaker but it was clear Firmino could see the funny side of the situation. Everyone connected with the team will have a laugh about what happened but no one will want to be on the receiving end of a similar reaction.\n\nLiverpool have developed a mean streak in the past two years. Their response to losing the Champions League final to Real Madrid last year was anger. No one wanted to suffer another defeat like Kiev. They have become more mean-eyed and clinical. One of the signature moments in the semi-final against Barcelona came in the second leg at Anfield. With Liverpool three goals down, Andy Robertson bundled over Lionel Messi and then rubbed the Argentinian\u2019s head in mockery. Robertson showed absolutely no respect for the world\u2019s best player and the contemptuous act enlivened the Kop as much as any goal in the 4-0 win.\n\nKlopp\u2019s team are becoming a different animal. They are up for a scrap \u2013 even if it is between themselves if someone does not reach the heights that are demanded. No one can complain if Salah shoots but he needs to score. If he misses he cannot moan if Mane \u2013 or anyone else \u2013 lets him know he needs to do better. The row at Burnley shows Liverpool are on the right path.", "description": "Sadio Mane was right to get annoyed with Mohamed Salah when the Egyptian did not pass the ball his way in Liverpool\u2019s 3-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday.
